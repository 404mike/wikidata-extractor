He was born in Scampston near Norton-on-Derwent in the East Riding of Yorkshire (now in North Yorkshire).Wilson made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 1946, as a left-handed batsman, and a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler. He was also an occasional wicket-keeper and a talented fielder close to the bat. In 1954-55, he was a surprise selection for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to Australia and New Zealand under Leonard Hutton, but he never adjusted to the fast pace of Australian pitches, and was not picked for any of the Test matches. He also represented MCC at home in 1962 and 1963.Though he was by then far from guaranteed a place in the first team, Wilson survived the purge of Yorkshire's playing staff in 1958 which saw Johnny Wardle, Bob Appleyard and Frank Lowson leave the staff and a new young team take shape under the captaincy of Ronnie Burnet. After Burnet retired, Wilson was appointed as the first professional county captain of Yorkshire in 1960. He had a successful tenure, leading the club to the County Championship title in 1960 and 1962. He retired in 1962, and was succeeded by Brian Close for the 1963 season.\nWilson was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1961.Wilson died in his home in Yedingham, near Malton, on 5 June 2008, aged 87.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["The MCC team was seen off by family, friends and well-wishers on the \u2019'Orsava'\u2019. Cowdrey's parents came to see him off and Len Hutton assured them that he would look after the young player. They were not the only well-wishers to see him off. Frank Tyson saw \"a spare, stooped old man, dressed immaculately in a pin-stripe suit\" telling the Cowdrey \"When you reach Australia, just remember one thing \u2013 Hate the Bastards!\". He spoke with such vehemence that Tyson asked George Duckworth who the old gent was, \"That was Douglas Jardine\", a fellow Oxford University man who had come down especially to see Cowdrey. Soon after the voyage began Cowdrey and Tyson were warned by the captain Len Hutton that they were secondary players who were expected to play little part in the Test matches, but in the end their efforts would prove decisive in England's victory.Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon: The Inside Story of the MCC Tour of Australia and New Zealand 1954/55, Parrs Wood Press (2004), pp. 23, 252 They traveled first-class on the Orsova which took six weeks to arrive in Western Australia, after stopping for a one-day game against Ceylon, where Cowdrey made 66 not out.

Hutton made a small bet that Vic Wilson, a strapping Yorkshire farmer who could hit the ball many a mile, would score more Test runs than Cowdrey on the tour (a wager he lost).E.W.

Against New South Wales Cowdrey had to rescue the innings with Hutton (102). He made a sweetly timed 110 as they added 163 together, but no other batsman exceeded 11 and the team was out for 252. In the second innings Cowdrey opened with Vic Wilson as Hutton tried out potential openers. Wilson was out for a duck, but Cowdrey made another hundred (103), but only Hutton himself (87), batting at number 6, gave him any help. The MCC were out for 327, Cowdrey and Hutton making 402 of the 577 runs scored, the other 9 batsmen making 117 in two innings. Cowdrey bowled again and went for 38 runs off 3 overs while doing impressions of the Australian fast bowlers Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller.Tyson, pp. 84\u201387"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["Early in his career, Boycott continued to play in his spectacles, and later switched to contact lenses. He feared his career would have ended had he not used such aids as his eyesight was poor.McKinstry, p. 29. Boycott's initial appearances for Yorkshire failed to impress, and he was compared unfavourably to his main rival, John Hampshire. When Brian Close took over from Vic Wilson as captain of Yorkshire in 1963 he persuaded the committee to keep Boycott on, and was rewarded when, on 2 June 1963, Boycott scored 145 against Lancashire.McKinstry, p. 47. His century was also part of a 249-run fourth-wicket partnership which became a Yorkshire record.Boycott, p. 60. Boycott cemented his place in the Yorkshire XI in the 1963 season with successive scores of 76, 53, 49 not out and 50, and on 29 August made a century partnership in both innings of a match against Leicestershire with Ken Taylor.Boycott, p. 63. Boycott handed in his notice to the Ministry of Pensions that same year.McKinstry, p. 48. After a brief loss of form he kept his place with scores of 62, 28 and 113 in the following matches.McKinstry, p. 49. This second century again came against Lancashire, making Boycott the first Yorkshire cricketer to score his first two centuries in a Roses match, as the hotly contested Yorkshire versus Lancashire matches were termed.Boycott, p. 64."]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25.", "Back in England after the 1953\u201354 tour, Trueman in 1954 was able to play a full season for the first time since 1951. Jim Kilburn wrote that, at the age of 23, Trueman \"had acquired a man's physique for fast bowling that questioned the courage as well as the technique of opposing batsmen\".Kilburn, p. 141. He played in 33 matches and, for the first time, exceeded 100 wickets in a season. His tally was 134 at 15.55 with a best return of eight for 28. Yorkshire probably should have won the County Championship in 1954 having won six of their first seven matches but were badly hit by wet weather in August and finished runners-up behind Surrey.Webber, p. 88. Trueman and the medium-paced Appleyard formed an effective combination, backed up by Wardle's spin, and Yorkshire had a strong bowling side. The rest of the team mostly comprised Hutton, Lowson, Yardley, Lester, Watson, Vic Wilson, Close, Illingworth and wicket-keeper Roy Booth.", "Trueman had a problem with so-called \"drag\" in 1955 when he was no-balled twice for not having his rear foot behind the bowling crease when he released the ball (i.e., he had dragged his back foot over the line before completing delivery). To remedy this, he reduced his run up by six yards, and with no apparent loss of pace.Arlott, p. 89. Yorkshire were involved in a two-horse race for the County Championship but were again let down by one poor spell, this time in June, and had to settle for second place as Surrey won a fourth consecutive title.Webber, p. 89. With Appleyard ill, Trueman and Wardle shared the main weight of the bowling with support from Close. As Arlott points out, Yorkshire had a \"serious weakness\" in the lack of a regular fast bowling partner for Trueman. The situation was alleviated when Cowan was available, but his appearances were limited by national service and then by a back injury sustained on the MCC tour of Pakistan in 1955\u201356.Arlott, p. 87. There were some signs of change, most notably with the arrival of Jimmy Binks as wicket-keeper and, with more appearances by Doug Padgett and Ken Taylor, the 1960s team was beginning to take shape. Appleyard, Hutton and Lester were less active than before. Otherwise, the mainstays with Trueman were Close, Illingworth, Lowson, Billy Sutcliffe, Wardle, Watson, Vic Wilson and Yardley.", "Trueman made 31 first-class appearances in 1956 but had difficulty with a persistent strain in his left side, exacerbated by occasional sciatica, and he reverted to his long run after more problems with drag at the start of the season. Yorkshire's team underwent change before the season began with the retirements of Hutton and Yardley. Yardley was succeeded as captain by Billy Sutcliffe, with whom Trueman had a good relationship.As It Was, pp. 182\u2013183. Rain badly affected the County Championship and Yorkshire managed only eight wins in their 28 matches to finish seventh.Webber, p. 90. With Trueman largely ineffective due to his injury, the bowling was carried by Appleyard, Wardle and the emerging Ray Illingworth. Binks, Illingworth and Vic Wilson played in all of Yorkshire's 28 championship matches in 1956. The other essential players, besides Trueman when fit, were Appleyard, Close, Lowson, Padgett, Sutcliffe, Taylor, Wardle and Watson.", "Trueman played in 32 first-class matches in 1957, taking 135 wickets. He had an outstanding time in his favoured leg slip position, holding 36 catches. There were more problems in the Yorkshire dressing room, principally a petition started by certain players for the club committee to sack Billy Sutcliffe from the captaincy. Trueman refused to sign it but, in August, Sutcliffe decided to resign. Despite this, Yorkshire still managed to finish third, though a long way behind champions Surrey. Yorkshire's main players in 1957 were Appleyard, Binks, Close, Illingworth, Lowson, Padgett, Sutcliffe, Taylor, Trueman, Wardle, Watson and Vic Wilson.", "Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new captain in 1958. Not an accomplished player, though he had previously captained the club's Second XI, he was a good man-manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get the best out of what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons.Arlott, pp. 98\u201399. The other \"trouble-maker\", Appleyard, lost his ability as a result of his illnesses and Yorkshire dropped him for good mid-season. Although the team could only finish 11th in the County Championship, having lost 24 full days to the weather, it was a much happier dressing room than it had been since 1946. Regular team members now included Binks, Brian Bolus, Burnet, Close, Cowan, Trueman, Illingworth, Lowson, Padgett, David Pickles, Phil Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was really beginning to take shape.Arlott, p. 99.", "In 1960, Vic Wilson having succeeded the retired Burnet as captain, Yorkshire won the Championship again but Kilburn wrote that they did so \"without laying any pretensions to being an outstanding side\".Kilburn, p. 162. Trueman's bowling by then contributed the team's main strength. He played in all five Tests that summer against South Africa yet still captured 150 wickets for Yorkshire, sometimes serving as a fast-medium bowler off a shortened run. His outstanding performance was taking seven in both innings against Surrey at the Oval. Trueman's value to the team was illustrated by them, in Kilburn's words, \"having to wait for wickets when he was not in action\".Kilburn, p. 163. He made 32 first-class appearances and took 175 wickets, the highest season tally of his entire career, at the outstanding average of 13.98. Yorkshire's team in 1960 was mostly drawn from Binks, Jack Birkenshaw, Bolus, Close, Cowan, Illingworth, Padgett, Mel Ryan, Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman and the Wilsons.", "In 1962, Yorkshire regained the County Championship title, but had to defeat Glamorgan on the final day of the season to secure the necessary points. Vic Wilson retired at the end of the season. The main players were Binks, Bolus, Close, Illingworth, Padgett, Ryan, Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson. In another outstanding season of pace and swing, Trueman took 153 first-class wickets in 33 first-class appearances. He also scored 840 runs, which was the best season tally of his whole career but, because of inconsistency, he remained well short of the standard required if he was to be termed an all-rounder, though that is not something he ever pursued given his workload as a specialist bowler. In a five-Test series that year, England made short work of a Pakistan team that was weak in attack. As in 1961, Trueman played in the first four Tests but not the fifth Test at the Oval. He took 22 wickets in the series, his best match being the second Test at Lord's in which he took nine, the highlight being six for 31 in the first innings to bowl Pakistan out for only 100.Playfair 1963, p. 52."]}, {"page": "Len Hutton", "response": ["Expectations before the Australian tour were low after the confusion of the 1954 summer and some controversial selections.Gibson, p. 187. Trueman, Jim Laker and Tony Lock, part of the winning 1953 team, were omitted; Colin Cowdrey and Vic Wilson were included. Hutton further downplayed his team's chances through exaggerating its inexperience to the Australian press; newspapers were already sympathetic to Hutton as a professional captain of a class-driven country.Marshall, p. 165. The team began the tour well. Hutton made a series of good scores in the opening games.Howat, p. 152. But for the first Test, Hutton did not include a spinner in the team and chose to bowl on winning the toss, an unusual strategy in Australia. The home side scored 601, England dropped 12 catches and, with the key players Evans and Compton injured, lost by an innings; the press blamed Hutton for choosing to bowl.Howat, p. 153. Despite the result, Hutton saw potential in Frank Tyson's bowling and arranged for Alf Gover, a respected coach who was in Australia as a journalist, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket.Howat, p. 154. For the second Test, Hutton left out the unfit Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, to include two spinners,Howat, p. 155. but in a low-scoring game, Tyson made the difference and England won by 38 runs. Hutton was unwell before the third Test, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold, and had to be persuaded out of bed by members of his team. He decided to play at the last minute and unexpectedly left out Bedser again, although he was fit to play. Hutton neglected to inform Bedser, who only learned of his omission when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match.Howat, pp. 156\u201357. Hutton contributed few runs, but Cowdrey and Peter May made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128-run victory. The fourth Test was crucial, and Hutton's innings of 80 runs in four-and-a-half hours was the highest of the game. Wisden believed Hutton's tactics were instrumental in giving his team the upper hand, and in the final innings, England needed 94 to win and retain the Ashes. Early wickets, including Hutton's, fell to Miller, and when the captain returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had \"done us again.\" Compton, the next man in, replied \"I haven't been in yet\", and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton.Gibson, p. 88. England went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out. This ended the series, which England won 3\u20131.", "Some of his selections as captain were widely debated. Following incidents in the Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment.Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 111\u201312. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954\u201355 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton;Chalke and Hodgson, p. 128. neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required.Woodcock, p. 54. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton found it hard to talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals.Marshall, pp. 160\u201361. On the other hand, Hutton played a key role in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success.Marshall, p. 160. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954\u201355 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Vic Wilson"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["In 1960, Vic Wilson became Yorkshire's first professional captain since Tom Emmett when he succeeded Ronnie Burnet.

In those days the MCC saw tours as a means of encouraging overseas cricket and strengthening the ties that bound the Commonwealth. Lord Cobham gave a speech in which he reminded the team that it was more important to not disgrace the face of English cricket even at the cost of series, though several young players had other ideas about this.p6, Tyson The party was a large one of 18 players, Denis Compton suffered a recurrence of his knee trouble which had plagued him on the 1950-51 tour and required remedial surgery. Yorkshire's \"Farmer Vic\" Wilson was a surprise choice as his replacement and Compton was later flown out to join the team in Australia. The other 17 were seen off by family, friends and well-wishers on the Orsava. Frank Tyson saw \"a spare, stooped old man, dressed immaculately in a pin-stripe suit\" telling the young Colin Cowdrey, \"when you reach Australia, just remember one thing - hate the bastards!\". He spoke with such vehemence that Tyson asked George Duckworth who the old gent was, \"That was Douglas Jardine\", the reason behind Lord Cobham's speech on good sportsmanship. They travelled first class on the Orsova, which took six weeks to arrive in Western Australia, after stopping for a one-day game against Ceylon. Unused to the lavish fare and freed of rationing, the players soon added weight and Frank Tyson increased his weight from 161 lbs (73\u00a0kg) to 182\u00a0lbs (83\u00a0kg).p12, Tyson Unfortunately for the Australians he exercised regularly so the extra weight was turned into muscle. Soon after the voyage began Vic Wilson, Colin Cowdrey, Peter Loader, Jim McConnon, Keith Andrew and Frank Tyson were warned by Len Hutton that they were secondary players who were expected to play little part in the Test matches.p23 and p252, Tyson", "In the days when state matches were seen as a source of entertainment and revenue and not just practice for the Tests extra matches were improvised to generate money and to allow the selectors to see promising players in action, or to allow the crowd to see the international players. So a week after their defeat Western Australia was reinforced with the presence of Neil Harvey, Graeme Hole and Ian Johnson. Peter May was the MCC captain as Hutton was still injured and won the toss. In keeping with the strategy of putting the opposition in against the England fast bowling attack the Combined XI were asked to bat and crashed to 86 all out. Only the opener Jack Rutherford (39) scored more than 9 and Brian Statham topped the bowling figures with 3/21, Tyson (2/14), Bailey (2/16) and Wardle (2/11) all took cheap wickets, but Godfrey Evans had the most dismissals with 4 catches and a stumping. Bill Edrich was bowled for a duck, Ian Johnson (3/44) took 2 more wickets in his first over and the MCC were 60/3 at stumps. The next day May made a superb 129 on a poor pitch, adding 179 with Vic Wilson (72), but the last 7 wickets fell for 90 runs and the tourists were out for 311. After facing a few balls in the evening the Combined XI fell again, but less spectacularly than in the first innings . No batsman made more than 38, but four made over twenty before they were spun out by Johnny Wardle (4/34) and Bob Appleyard (3/36). The MCC won by an innings and 62 runs and earned another rest day before they flew east.p51-55, Tyson", "New South Wales was the strongest state the MCC would meet on the tour, winning the Sheffield Shield 14 times in 16 seasons between 1948\u201349 and 1961\u201362 and nearly 60,000 people came to see the champions take on the touring team over the course of the four day match. New South Wales were led by the flamboyant Keith Miller who won the toss and put the visitors in to bat, much to Len Hutton's annoyance as he wanted to do the same. Again he had to rescue the innings, making 102 and only receiving support from the baby-faced Colin Cowdrey who had yet to make a century in the County Championship, but made a sweetly timed 110 as they added 163 together. No other batsman exceeded 11 and the team was out for 252. Miller rotated his bowlers and the wickets were shared by Pat Crawford (3/51) whose drag allowed him to bowl a yard down the wicket, Alan Davidson (3/41), bowling with a shoulder injury, and the slow left-arm wrist-spin of John Treanor (3/64). Young Billy Watson, playing in his second First Class match raced to 155 and with the help of his captain's 86 took New South Wales past the MCC score three wickets down. From there wickets fell steadily to Frank Tyson 4/98 and Alec Bedser 4/117, who was suffering from a rash, and they were all out for 382. To try out potential openers Hutton put Vic Wilson and Cowdrey in first. Wilson was out for a duck, but Cowdrey made another hundred (103), but only Hutton himself (87), batting at number 6, gave him any help. The MCC were out for 327, Cowdrey and Hutton making 402 of the 577 runs scored, the other 9 batsmen making 117 in two innings. Even Miller saw that 198 for victory in 75 minutes was impossible and sent in his young players for batting practice and Cowdrey went for 38 runs off 3 overs doing bowling impressions of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and others, but Peter Loader took 2/14 before the gamed ended with New South Wales on 78/2.84-87, Tyson", "After the horrors of the Brisbane Test the MCC got to play another upcountry game played in a rodeo dustbowl. Hutton won the toss, batted and put on 112 with Bill Edrich (74), who seemed to have regained his form, before he was out for 40. Peter May made 69 and Vic Wilson 61, but the last five wickets fell for 26 runs., from 291/5 to 317 all out, with the retired Queensland leg spinner Donald Watt taking 5/56 with help from fellow leggie Kenneth Jenkins (4/44). The innings had reduced the makeshift wicket to the consistency of a golf bunker and Hutton allowed it to be rebuilt for the next day. Opener Wilfred Brown top scored with 22 in the Country innings as they collapsed to 95 off 42.1 eight-ball overs with Peter Loader (3/22), Johnny Wardle (2/22), Bob Appleyard (2/18) and Tom Graveney (2/8) sharing the wickets. Hutton put them straight back in again and this time they did better, Brown making 78 and adding 108 for the second wicket with Renald Sippel (45), but Appleyard (7/51) spun his way through the rest of the batting order with some help from Graveney (2/49). The home team agreed to play past stumps so that the MCC could dismiss them, and the tourists won by an innings and 12 runs. This received some criticism in the Australian press, who forgot that Hutton had sportingly allowed the wicket to be remade.p110-112, Tyson", "When he finished there was a thunder-clap from the storm outside \"Listen, he's just started his run-up!\" joked Hassett. The match was a game played in one day with each side playing one innings rather than Limited overs cricket in the modern sense of the term. Hutton won the toss and opened with Bill Edrich, but both were out for 25/2, but Peter May made 101 and added 98 with Vic Wilson (29) and 76 with Tom Graveney (56). Johnny Wardle scooped and swatted 37 not out and the MCC declared on 278/7 after 40 eight-ball overs. The match had a party atmosphere and Hassett gave 9 of his players a bowl, six of them took a wicket and himself 2/34 with his medium pacers. Tailender Ian Johnson opened the Australian batting and was out for 4, but his partner was the big hitting Richie Benaud who smashed the ball all over the ground in his 113 as the Prime Minister's XI made 247 off 30.3 overs. One of his sixes was caught by the Governor General Field Marshal Sir William Slim and a businessman donated \u00a335 and 10 shillings to local charities, 30 shillings for each six and 10 for each four. Veteran batsman Sam Loxton hit 47 and Keith Miller 38 as Bill Edrich's fast bowling cost him 40 runs off 5 overs, though he did take 2 wickets. Johnny Wardle (4/73) produced a middle order collapse from 195/2 to 234/7 with Vic Wilson helping him with three catches. When Hassett came in to bat Tyson was brought on and took an outrageously long run up before bowling a slow donkey drop. He then bowled a real bouncer that hit Hassett on the hand before catching him off Len Hutton's leg spin (3/15) for a 31 run victory.p113-116, Tyson", "Some of the oldest grade clubs in Australia are in Tasmania, but it was a weak state side that did not fully complete in the Sheffield Shield for another twenty years. Richie Benaud, Alan Davidson, Les Favell and Neil Harvey were flown out to help the Tasmanian team in another Combined XI. Thanks to the Third Test a record 20,000 spectators turned out on the small Hobart ground to watch. The Tasmanian captain Emerson Rodwell won the toss and batted only to see Favell out for a duck, thanks to Alec Bedser (3/56) as the ball swung heavily. Peter Loader (4/81) took two more wickets and Benaud was caught off \"Big Al\" to leave them 72/4, but Harvey (82) and Rodwell (72) added 60 before Trevor Bailey (3/29) reduced 132/4 to 146/7. Rodwell added another 54 runs with Terence Cowley (12) before Bailey caught him off Bedser, Loader took the last two wickets and the Combined XI were out for 221. This looked good as the tourists now fell to the swing bowling of Alan Davidson (4/45) as they collapsed to 167/7 with Denis Compton making 46. Bailey stuck around for 53 and Bedser took the score up to 242 with 19. The Combined XI batted again, but waited until they were 184/6 before Rodwell declared, with Neil Harvey 47 and Richie Benaud 68 not out. The unlucky Jim McConnon broke his little finger when fielding a powerful Harvey on-drive, as it would take until the end of the tour to mend he was sent home when they reached the mainland. The MCC had an hour and forty minutes to make 164 for victory so Hutton sent Keith Andrew to open, but he was soon out and Reg Simpson (37 not out) and Vic Wilson (33 not out) together at the end on 99/2.p159-163, Tyson", "Bereft of its Australian players Tasmania suffered in the state match against the tourists, but still 12,000 came to see the game at Launceston. Hutton, who was lucky with the toss in Australia, won again, chose this time to bat and made 61, but the star of the day was the stylish Tom Graveney with 134. They added 127 for the second wicket, then Graveney put on 105 with Denis Compton (50) for the third. There was a small collapse from 243/2 to 281/6, but Vic Wilson (cricketer) (62 not out) and Johnny Wardle entertained with 111 for the sixth wicket and Hutton declared at 427/7 on the second morning, Noel Diprose the best of the bowlers with 4/107. The Tasmanians had no answer to the in-swing and off-cutters of Peter Loader who took 6/22 off 12 eight-ball overs and were out for 117, captain Emerson Rodwell had to retire hurt on 2, but returned to be bowled by Loader for 11. Hutton, 310 runs ahead elected to bat again, perhaps to entertain the Saturday crowd the next day and sent in nightwatchmen Frank Tyson to open with Reg Simpson. Simpson failed again, ending his chances of playing in the Tests and Bob Appleyard joined Tyson. The MCC scratched round the next day for 133/6 declared, Tyson's 27 was the top score and Terence Cowley took 4/53. Tasmania had no chance of making 444 runs to win and Hutton took the chance to exercise his bowlers. Mike Hyland (49) and added 60 with John Maddox (62 not out), who made his highest First Class score, but was left standing as the rest fell away and Tasmania were out for 200 for a 243 run win.p166-167, Tyson", "After winning The Ashes the MCC went to their final Country match in a jovial mood. Only three regular bowlers were taken, Alec Bedser, Peter Loader and Johnny Wardle, both wicket-keepers and the manager Geoffrey Howard. The Country XI won the toss, batted and were out for 182 with one Bill Young making 56 as Loader (4/29) and Wardle (5/46) were far too good for the bulk of the local batsmen. Len Hutton (75) and Reg Simpson (59) were 130/0 at the end of the day and Tom Graveney made 50 in the morning and Hutton was impressed with Rex Hollioake (2/69), the fast bowler from Ballarat, who he thought was quicker than any Australian outside the Tests.p21, Ian Ferguson, Cricket Fever Grips the Bush, Ashes Ablaze, Newspress Pty Ltd, 1986 Vic Wilson, Godfrey Evans and Wardle all made 17, and Hutton declared with Howard unbeaten on 0 at 307/8. The Country team were completely unable to read Johnny Wardle's highly varied off-breaks, leg-breaks and reverse-googlies and he finished with 7/45 (12/91 in the match), though Ron Milne came in a number 4 and finished 22 not out in a score of 99. The MCC won by an innings and 26 runs.", "The MCC returned to Sydney for their last state match and the Fifth and final Test. 34,198 fans came to watch the game over four days and despite frequent rain the match was fought to a finish and they were far from disappointed. The New South Wales captain Keith Miller won the toss and the Sheffield Shield champions elected to bat, but collapsed spectacularly to 3/3 as Alec Bedser (5/57) returned to form, removing both openers for ducks and having Richie Benaud caught by Johnny Wardle for one. Tom Graveney at slip caught the 18-year-old Bobby Simpson off Frank Tyson for 6 and Keith Miller off Peter Loader for 11 and New South Wales were 25/6. The 20 old Peter Philpott (46) and 21-year-old \"Sam\" Booth (74 not out) rescued the innings with a stand of 83, but Bedser returned to dismiss Philpot and Alan Davidson, Graveney's third catch. Johnny Wardle had wicket-keeper Ossie Lambert caught by Colin Cowdrey and Vic Wilson (2/1) came in at the end and took two wickets for one run off nine balls, Graveney taking his fourth catch to end the innings on 172 when John Treanor went for a duck. Keith Miller bowled Wilson for a duck and Pat Crawford got Peter May for 3 and the MCC ended the day on 4/2. They did not immediately improve their situation in the morning as Alan Davidson (4/25) dismissed nightwatchman Peter Loader for a duck after he had been hit hard on the thigh by Miller, Reg Simpson for 6 and Colin Cowdrey for 12, and the MCC were 35/5. Tom Graveney (35) and Len Hutton (48) rescued the innings with a stand of 59, Hutton ironically batting at number 7 to give himself a rest, Godfrey Evans made a perky 40, Johnny Wardle slashed his way to 19, but Tyson was run out by Ronald Briggs for 3 and the innings closed on 172, the scores even. Briggs was bowled by Tyson for a duck (and a pair), but Test hopefuls Jim Burke (98) and Bobby Simpson (62) saw out the day and added 159 for the second wicket, the injured Loader unable to bowl. When it rained the umpires refused to stop play and Hutton led his men off, leaving Simpson waiting at the crease on 98. When play resumed the angry Simpson was fooled by a Johnny Wardle left-arm reverse-googly and stumped. Graveney took his fifth catch off Wardle (5/118) to dispose of Burke and Davidson was caught by Cowdrey for a duck to leave New South Wales 196/4. Richie Benaud (59) and Miller (71) added 64, smashing Wilson for 42 runs off 4 eight ball overs before Benaud was stumped off Wardle. Bedser (2/87) dismissed both Miller and Booth and Miller declared half an hour from stumps on 314/8. The MCC needed 315 to win in just over a day, but Hutton tried to have another \"rest\" by batting at number 5 and Simpson (24) and Graveney (28) opened the innings. They were 26/0 at the end of the day, but both fell to Benaud (2/62). Wilson was bowled by Davidson (2/43) for 4 and the tourists were in trouble at 68/3. Peter May (42), Len Hutton (59), Crowdrey (33) and Evans (39) kept the runs coming even though wickets fell at regular intervals. At 250/6 needed only 65 more runs, but leg-spinner John Treanor (3/39) cleaned up the tail as they slumped from 261/7 to 269 all out and New South Wales won a thrilling 45 run victory, the only defeat the tourists suffered except for the First Test.
