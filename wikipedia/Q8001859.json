On 27 July it flew from Fairlop to Brooklands on a complicated 55 mile route avoiding the built-up parts of London.  In late September, after a period in which Handley Page were preoccupied with the military trials of the Type F and the move of their works from Barking to Cricklewood, the Type E was flown to Hendon by Wilfred Parke and then used to carry some 28 passengers on joy flights, including two children together.  It was also flown by other, non-company pilots until sustaining minor damage.  During repair the rectangular fin was replaced by a triangular one.  Handling was improved and several flights were made with three passengers before the aircraft was spruced up for its appearance at the Olympia Show in February 1913, where it was inspected by King George V.  Immediately afterwards a new wing was fitted with the wing warping system replaced by ailerons formed by hinging the outer trailing edge extensions; the earlier side-to-side rolling characteristic was cured.  The Type E flew exhibitions, demonstrations and joy rides through the Summer of 1913, mostly in the north of England.  It was then modified for use as an advanced single-seat trainer for a flying school at Hendon.  The fuselage was shortened by 14 in (356\u00a0mm) and the separate pairs of fuselage struts that carried the wing bracing wires were replaced by a four-strut pyramid. The earlier undercarriage was replaced by a simpler arrangement of the kind used on the B.E.2c, with a solid axle and two skids.  It flew in that form on 4 July 1914 and was in use to the start of World War I, when it was first impressed, then discarded.  The aircraft did not fly again, but made a few celebratory outings and survived until 1940, when it was destroyed to make space in the Radlett factory.

The next day the engine failed soon after takeoff and a wing and the undercarriage were seriously damaged in the resulting crosswind landing.  The Type F was withdrawn from the trials and returned to the new factory at Cricklewood for repairs. It was in the air again in early November, flown with enthusiasm with a variety of passengers by Wilfred Parke on most days.  The Type F was lost on 15 December 1912 when engine failure led to the death of Parke and his passenger, Alfred Arkell Hardwick.
