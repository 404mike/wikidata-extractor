Another of his longstops, a man called Dench, insisted on fielding with a sack of straw tied to his chest for protection.Frith, p.28. E H Budd played against both Brown and Walter Marcon, who had a similar reputation, and Budd said that \"Brown was not more terrific in his speed than Marcon\", an elaborate way of saying that they were both extremely fast.Frith, p.41. Brown was a useful batsman and made 1053 runs at 11.44 with a top score of 70 which he scored during the first of the three roundarm trial matches.
