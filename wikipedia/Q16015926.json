In 1932, Melville was the Oxford captain in his own right, but his season was disrupted by injury \u2013 though not to the same degree as Moore's had been in 1931 \u2013 when he broke his collarbone while batting in the match against the Free Foresters by colliding with his partner, Pieter van der Bijl. Melville had made an unbeaten century, 113* before the collision. On his return to the side in late June, he was successful with the ball, taking a hat-trick and nine wickets in the game against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, and he finished top of the University bowling averages. In the University Match, Melville was unable to repeat his leadership success of 1931, and the match was drawn."]}, {"page": "Newlyweds (TV series)", "response": ["* Denis Moore as Ross Roberts "]}, {"page": "Just Us (film)", "response": ["* Denis Moore as Christie"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Denis Moore (1930\u20131941) : D.
