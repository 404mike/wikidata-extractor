Newell moved to sign West Ham United left back Joe Widdowson in his absence. On his return to fitness, Grimsby accepted an approach by rivals Lincoln City to take Newey on loan; however, the player rejected the chance of playing at Sincil Bank due to his fitness levels not being adequate to merit a first-team place. Newey returned to first-team action a few weeks later, but found himself out of favour, with Newell preferring to use Widdowson, freezing the long-term Grimsby left back out of his regular spot in the team. On 17 March 2009, Newey was told he could leave the club on a free transfer along with goalkeepers Phil Barnes and Gary Montgomery.Trio Released, GTFC World, 17 March 2009.
