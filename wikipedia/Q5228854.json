So the two travelled to Methil (from London\u2014several hundred miles), with a polaroid camera, to meet the assistant manager, whose name was indeed Dave Gorman. More trips followed, to meet more Dave Gormans. During a trip to New York, Gorman applied somewhat arbitrary criteria to exclude one man from the list on the grounds that a metal plaque outside his offices showed his name as \"B. David Gorman\" (his justification for this\u2014given on his web forum\u2014was \"You've got to have rules\").
