Most of the equipment used in the production was borrowed. The audio quality and lighting on the opening reel are rather poor, which makes the dialogue difficult to follow for the first few minutes. The scenes set in Salisbury in the earlier part of the film were photographed and edited by Peter Watkins. Stanley Kubrick, who was intrigued by the project, donated film stock from Dr. Strangelove to Brownlow to help him finish the film. Veteran wartime BBC radio announcers Alvar Lidell and John Snagge gave their services free to voice reconstructed newsreels and radio broadcasts. Support was also given by director Tony Richardson, who helped to pay for the final production.Kevin Brownlow: How It Happened Here.
