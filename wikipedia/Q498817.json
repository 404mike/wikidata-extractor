The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.", "Titanium was discovered in 1791 by the clergyman and amateur geologist William Gregor as an inclusion of a mineral in Cornwall, Great Britain. Gregor recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet. Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides: iron oxide (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, Gregor reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.Gregor, William (1791) \"Beobachtungen und Versuche \u00fcber den Menakanit, einen in Cornwall gefundenen magnetischen Sand\" (Observations and experiments regarding menaccanite [i.e., ilmenite], a magnetic sand found in Cornwall), Chemische Annalen \u2026, 1, pp. 40\u201354, 103\u2013119.Gregor, William (1791) \"Sur le menakanite, esp\u00e8ce de sable attirable par l'aimant, trouv\u00e9 dans la province de Cornouilles\" (On menaccanite, a species of magnetic sand, found in the county of Cornwall), Observations et M\u00e9moires sur la Physique, 39: 72\u201378, 152\u2013160."]}, {"page": "The Lizard", "response": ["Titanium was discovered here by the Reverend William Gregor in 1791."]}, {"page": "Ilmenite", "response": ["In 1791 William Gregor discovered ilmenite, in a stream that runs through the valley just south of the village of Manaccan (Cornwall), and identified for the first time titanium as one of the constituents of ilmenite.Gregor, William (1791) \"Beobachtungen und Versuche \u00fcber den Menakanit, einen in Cornwall gefundenen magnetischen Sand\" (Observations and experiments regarding menaccanite [i.e., ilmenite], a magnetic sand found in Cornwall), Chemische Annalen \u2026, 1, pp. 40\u201354, 103\u2013119.", "Titanium was identified for the first time by William Gregor in 1791 in ilmenite from the Manaccan valley in Cornwall, southwest England."]}, {"page": "1791 in science", "response": ["* The element Titanium is discovered included in ilmenite in Cornwall, England, by local amateur geologist Rev.

As there are no Gothic stone crosses in Camborne or adjacent parishes it is likely that these crosses were set up at Creed instead. In Creed parish there are the remains of four 15th-century crosses, three of which were cut from Pentewan stone. The market cross of Grampound is more ornate than the other three crosses. Fair Cross is a Gothic cross shaft. Nancor Cross has a cross head which was found in the 1920s near Nancor Farm; it was later set on a new shaft and erected beside the A390 road. In 1995 it was broken into four pieces but repaired in 1996. The fourth cross consists only of a cross base at Creed Lane.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

It was isolated to 95% purity by Lars Nilson and Otto Pettersson, and later isolated to 98% purity by Henri Moissan using an electric furnace. In 1910, Hunter produced 99.9% pure titanium in a method that became known as the Hunter Process. The process involves heating Titanium Chloride with metallic Sodium in an airtight steel cylinder known as a \"metal bomb\". Because of the dangers of elemental Sodium and the high temperatures and pressures involved, many of the experiments were done outside on the football field of the RPI campus. Hunter believed titanium might have a high melting point and would be able to replace the carbon filaments that were used in light bulbs at the time. It turned out its melting point was not high enough for application in light bulbs, but he found other useful properties of the metal. The Hunter process is very inefficient, and is not able to produce large amounts of Titanium, so production of Titanium remained mainly confined to the laboratory until being replaced by the more efficient Kroll process in the 1940s. The Hunter process remains of use only in the most demanding applications where high purity is needed."]}, {"page": "William Gregor (chemist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Gregor"]}, {"page": "Titanium ring", "response": ["Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, England, in 1791 by William Gregor.
