From the reign of King (Shah) Sultan Husayn (1694\u20131722) to Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (1797\u20131834), the local rulers of Fuman were involved in a fierce rivalry with the local rulers of neighboring Shaft. John Elton, who had been prominent under Nader Shah (1736\u20131747), was killed in 1751 on the order of one of these rulers, Agha Jamal Fumani. In 1805, during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, Fuman was reportedly \"still a small, open town with about a thousand houses and a very lively market\". However, the situation changed when Hajji Mohammad Khan abandoned Fuman for Rasht during the early reign of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (1848\u20131896). In the subsequent period, Fuman \"fell into decay\". According to Grigorii Melgunov, who visited Fuman in 1860, it was little more than a village consisting of just 140 houses surrounding the palace of the local ruler. Fuman has regained importance since the mid-20th century."]}, {"page": "Elton (name)", "response": ["* John Elton (died 1751), English shipbuilder and seaman, adventurer in Persia"]}, {"page": "Mirza Muhammad Khan I", "response": ["Next year, another threat from Persia - Muhammad Hasan khan landed in what is today Azerbaijan.
