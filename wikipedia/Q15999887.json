Franklin went on to make his debut for Buckinghamshire against Berkshire in the 1911 Minor Counties Championship.  In that same season he made his first-class debut for Cambridge University against Yorkshire.  He would go on to make a further 14 first-class appearances for the university, the last of which came against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI in 1913.  He gained his Blue in 1912, but in 1913 he did find his opportunities limited by the arrival of Arthur Lang in the team, who the Cambridge selectors thought was a better batsman.  A more than capable wicket-keeper, Franklin took 16 catches and made 15 stumpings, an unusual amount considering most wicket-keepers will take considerably more catches in their first-class careers.  With the bat in hand, he scored 307 runs at an average of 21.92, with a high score of 68 not out.  This score, one of two fifties he made for the university, came against Sussex in 1913."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Arthur Lang", "|Arthur Langton"]}, {"page": "1956 Dutch TT", "response": ["|  Arthur Lang"]}]}}
