The shattered terrain is more like the high ground in the arctic regions of Canada or Norway than the European Alps or North American Rocky Mountains. The weather often deteriorates rapidly with elevation, so that when there are moderate conditions 150 metres below the plateau the top can be stormy or misty and there can be icy or powdery snow. Even when no snow is falling the wind can whip up lying snow to produce white-out conditions for a few metres above the surface and snowdrifts can build up rapidly in sheltered places. Gravel can be blown through the air and walking can be impossible. Scottish mountaineer Adam Watson explained how gale conditions can be extremely challenging on the plateau, making it difficult if not impossible to walk, see beyond a few feet, breathe, and communicate with other party members. In March 1986 a wind speed of  () was measured at Cairngorm summit weather station: the highest wind speed ever recorded over land in the UK.", "In the 1960s a military group erected, without permission from the local authorities, the St Valery, El Alamein and Curran shelters on the Cairngorm Plateau. These could often become buried in snowdrifts but they attracted hikers and campers. The Curran shelter was of metal covered with boulders, had a floor area , and was beside Lochan Buidhe, the highest standing water in Britain. Predicting it would attract inexperienced walkers, Adam Watson and the Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland wrote to the Nature Conservancy pointing out the danger of a shelter in this location, but nothing was done about the matter.", "At the fatal accident inquiry held in Banff in February 1972, Adam Watson was the chief expert witness for the Crown.

The inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended", "The recommendation concerning the possible removal of high-level shelters was to become a cause of major disagreement. Traditional \"bothies\" were built for stalkers and gamekeepers and were in the valleys. The shelters being questioned were modern ones built high up on the plateau. The argument to keep them was that any shelter in an emergency was better than none \u2013 Cairngorm MRT, Banffshire County Council and local estate owners were of this opinion. However the Braemar MRT, most mountaineering bodies, the Chief Constable of police and Adam Watson thought they should be removed. More and more experts and politicians became involved and in July 1973 the Secretary of State for Scotland launched a formal consultation. Eventually, the Scottish Office decided it had no powers in the matter. In February 1974 at a meeting which excluded everyone except the local authority, police, and mountaineering experts, a decision for removal was taken and after further argument they were indeed removed.", "* Adam Watson is an academic and hill walker with very great experience of the Cairngorms."]}, {"page": "Irvine Butterfield", "response": ["Butterfield was a founder member of the John Muir Trust, set up in 1983, and by the time it purchased the mountain Schiehallion in 1998 he was a trustee and gave the royalties of his 1999 book The Magic of the Munros towards the cost.
