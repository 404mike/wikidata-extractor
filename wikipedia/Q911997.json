The mathematics has to describe the rates and dependencies of these transfer events. It was observed early on that the rate of jumping of many TEs varies with copy number, and so the first models simply used an empirical function for the rate of transposition. This had the advantage that it could be measured by experiments in the lab, but it left open the question of why the rate differs among elements and differs with copy number. Stan Sawyer and Daniel L. Hartl fitted models of this sort to a variety of bacterial TEs, and obtained quite good fits between copy number and transmission rate and the population-wide incidence of the TEs. TEs in higher organisms, like Drosophila, have a very different dynamics because of sex, and Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth, Charles Langley, John Brookfield and others modeled TE copy number evolution in Drosophila and other species. What is impressive about all these modeling efforts is how well they fitted empirical data, given that this was decades before discovery of the fact that the host fly has a powerful defense mechanism in the form of piRNAs. Incorporation of host defense along with TE dynamics into evolutionary models of TE regulation is still in its infancy."]}, {"page": "Rupert Sheldrake", "response": ["In 1983, an editorial in The Guardian compared the \"petulance of wrath of the scientific establishment\" aimed against Sheldrake with the Galileo affair and Lysenkoism.Being more than sorry about Galileo, The Guardian, 14 May 1983, p. 10 Responding in the same paper, Brian Charlesworth defended the scientific establishment, affirming that \"the ultimate test of a scientific theory is its conformity with the observations and experiments\" and that \"vitalistic and Lamarckian ideas which [The Guardian] seem to regard so highly have repeatedly failed this test.\"Charlesworth, Brian, The Holy See\u2014but it takes a long time to admit it, The Guardian, 19 May 1983, p. 12."]}, {"page": "Evolutionary biology", "response": ["James Crow, Richard Lewontin, Dan Hartl, Marcus Feldman, and Brian Charlesworth trained a generation of evolutionary biologists."]}, {"page": "The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection", "response": ["The publication of the variorum edition in 1999 led to renewed interest in the work and reviews by Laurence Cook, Brian Charlesworth, James F.

Futuyma notes that since 1970, two very different alternatives to Darwinian gradualism have been proposed, both by Stephen Jay Gould: mutationism, and punctuated equilibria.

His advocacy of Goldschmidt was attacked with \"highly unflattering comments\" by Brian Charlesworth and Alan Templeton.

Charlesworth obtained her doctorate at Cambridge University in 1968 with her thesis focusing on the quantitative genetics of mice, specifically the extent of genetic variation in the blood glucose levels across natural strains. This also happened to be the topic of her first study. Charlesworth continued her education at Cambridge and Chicago as a research fellow in human genetics examining amino acid variations in hemoglobins in human populations. Charlesworth's interest in evolutionary biology continued through her collaboration with Brian Charlesworth, specifically their works on mimicry systems and recombination rates causing her to shift her focus to evolution.

Rose", "response": ["His Ph.D. advisor was Brian Charlesworth. His main area of work has been the evolution of aging, approached both theoretically and empirically via the technique of experimental evolution. In 1991, he published Evolutionary Biology of Aging exploring a view of the subject based on antagonistic pleiotropy, the hypothesis that aging is caused by genes that have two effects, one acting early in life and the other much later. The genes are favored by natural selection as a result of their early-life benefits, and the costs that accrue much later appear as incidental side-effects that we identify as aging. Dr. Rose has also suggested that aging can stop in a latter stage of life. The field of aging biology is divided between those who think that it will be very difficult to develop technology to postpone human aging and those who expect breakthroughs in this field in the near future. Rose is an outspoken advocate for the former position."]}]}}
