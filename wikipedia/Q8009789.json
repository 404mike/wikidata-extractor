The war had changed Zyw, the shock and awe of brutal conflict as well as the realization of what had become of his family and homeland had engendered a serious stylistic change. These factors turned Zyw's art immediately inward and away from naturalism. And as he struggled for self-expression he produced a series of paintings featuring puppets and lay figures, symbols of helplessness and inability in the face of evil powers. This period did not last long however, and his travels back to Paris and discovery of Paul Klee had a direct influence on his art, and reminded him that painting was a positive and good creative effort, rather than purely an emotional outlet. His work in the 1950s saw him become a valued part of the Edinburgh scene, a scene which saw him exhibit with the likes of Anne Redpath and William George Gillies. In 1958, \u017byw visited the Venice Biennial and witnessed the Tachiste movement first hand, a movement which he highly disagreed with. The next period in \u017byw's art could be seen as a rejection against the autonomous and thick brush work of the Tachiste circle."]}, {"page": "W. Gordon Smith", "response": ["W.
