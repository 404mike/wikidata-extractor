A forward, he scored 44 goals in 182 league appearances in a seven-year career in the Football League.\nHe turned professional at Northampton Town in August 1993. He was loaned out to Dagenham & Redbridge in December 1995, and was transferred to Oxford United later in the month. He helped the club to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1995\u201396, but later fell out of favour, and was loaned out to Southend United in February 1998. He switched to Blackpool in August 1998, where he enjoyed loan spells out to Port Vale and Rushden & Diamonds. After a game at Nene Park, he was involved in a car accident on the A45, and died of his injuries, aged 25.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Martin Aldridge"]}, {"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["The sale of star midfielder Joey Beauchamp to West Ham for a club record \u00a31\u00a0million allowed Smith money to spend in the transfer market, and he spent \u00a3100,000 each on Norwich City midfielder David Smith and Sunderland striker David Rush. Oxford formed a strong promotion push in 1994\u201395, but were knocked out of the FA Cup in the first round by non-League Marlow. In February 1995, he spent \u00a360,000 on Hartlepool United's Phil Gilchrist, who would form a highly effective centre-back partnership with Elliott. Oxford finished the season in seventh place, six points outside the play-offs. In November 1995, Smith re-signed Beauchamp for \u00a3300,000, who continued his excellent form after returning to his native Oxfordshire. The next month he brought in striker Martin Aldridge on a free transfer. The club were 14th in January 1996, but lost only once in their last 17 matches of 1995\u201396 in a tremendous second half of the season that saw them climb 12 places to win promotion as runners-up.
