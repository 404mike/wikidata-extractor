It made him an \"accidental green hero\", according to The Guardian. In 2003, that paper had commissioned Leo Hickman to spend a year with his young family on a similar project, which resulted in a book entitled Life Stripped Bare: My Year Trying To Live Ethically. Rowlatt, who acknowledges his debt to Hickman (and to Lucy Siegle, author of Green Living in the Urban Jungle), continued in this vein, focusing on environmental impact, especially his carbon footprint\"We are told climate change is the biggest threat facing the world but is there anything the average family can do about it?

He states that veterinarians often comply with the industrialization of animals, for example in the prophylactic use of antibiotics which are applied in the mass production of animals, eggs and milk instead of demanding a different (pasture-based) agricultural system. According to Lymbery veterinarians should not support systems that are \"inherently bad for animal welfare\", which allegedly is the case in \"mass production of broiler chickens, caged production of eggs, the large-scale permanent housing of dairy cows (so-called mega dairies) and highly intensive pig production where mothering pigs are kept in confinement where they can't turn around for weeks at a time\".\"Have vets really sold out to industrial agri-business?\", Lucy Siegle, The Guardian, 19 January 2014"]}, {"page": "Zion Lights", "response": ["Lights is an outspoken science advocate: in 2015 the Western Morning News newspaper reported that she is against pseudoscience.

He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was \"actually fascinated by those [fashion] films that follow one person\". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco-activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it \"goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion\".
