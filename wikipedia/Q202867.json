A midfielder, he played for Leeds United from 1959 to 1976, and captained the side during this time, which was the most successful period of the club's history. \nAt Leeds, he won the First Division (1968\u201369 and 1973\u201374), Second Division (1963\u201364), Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1968 and 1971), FA Cup (1972), League Cup (1968), and FA Charity Shield (1969). The club also finished second in numerous competitions, being runners-up five times in the English league and seven times in cup finals, including the 1975 European Cup. He was also named as the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1970 and was listed on the PFA Team of the Year in 1973\u201374. He has since been voted Leeds United's greatest player of all time and has a statue outside the south-east corner of their Elland Road stadium. He has also been included in the Football League 100 Legends and is a member of both the English Football Hall of Fame and Scottish Football Hall of Fame.\nHe spent the period from 1976 to 1978 at Hull City, before being appointed player-manager at Doncaster Rovers in November 1978. He spent seven years at the helm, guiding the club to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1980\u201381 and 1983\u201384, before he took on the manager's job at Leeds United in October 1985. He could not get the club promoted back into the top flight, and left the club in September 1988. He returned to Doncaster in July 1989, ending his second spell in charge in November 1991.\nHe is on the Scotland national football team roll of honour for having won more than 50 caps for Scotland. He captained his country at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, where Scotland failed to advance from the group stage despite being unbeaten in the competition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 7", "response": ["*1997 \u2013 Billy Bremner, Scottish footballer and manager (b. 1942)"]}, {"page": "December 9", "response": ["*1942 \u2013 Billy Bremner, Scottish footballer and manager (d. 1997)"]}, {"page": "1997", "response": ["* December 7 \u2013 Billy Bremner, British footballer (b. 1942)"]}, {"page": "1942", "response": ["** Billy Bremner, Scottish footballer (d. 1997) "]}, {"page": "Stirling", "response": ["Scotland international footballers Billy Bremner, John Colquhoun, Duncan Ferguson, female footballer Frankie Brown and brothers Gary and Steven Caldwell were born in Stirling.

After the game, Clough emerged from the dressing room and told the expectant Italian reporters \"No cheating bastards do I talk to. I will not talk to any cheating bastards\" and then questioned the Italian nation's courage in the Second World War. It was these sorts of frequent, outspoken comments \u2013 particularly against football's establishment, such as the FA and club directors, and figures in the game such as Sir Matt Busby, Alan Hardaker, Alf Ramsey, Don Revie and Len Shipman, along with players such as Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Peter Lorimer \u2013 combined with Clough's increased media profile, that eventually led to his falling out with the Rams' chairman, Sam Longson, and the Derby County board of directors."]}, {"page": "FC Bayern Munich", "response": ["During the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final when Roth and M\u00fcller secured victory with late goals. \"We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners, but we were very, very lucky\", stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was \"very suspicious\". Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years. A year later in Glasgow, Saint-\u00c9tienne were defeated by another Roth goal and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs. The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoene\u00df retired while Gerd M\u00fcller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. Bayerndusel was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams."]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["The 1962\u201363 season was the beginning of a new era for Leeds United as Revie began to mould the team and the club into his own liking. In a game against Swansea Town in September, Revie dropped many senior players and played Charlton in a young new defensive line-up: Gary Sprake (goalkeeper), Paul Reaney (right-back), Norman Hunter and Charlton (centre-back), and Rod Johnson (left-back). With the exception of Johnson, this defensive line-up would remain consistent for much of the rest of the decade. Charlton took charge of the defence that day, and insisted upon a zonal marking system; Revie agreed to allow Charlton to become the key organiser in defence. Aided by new midfield signing Johnny Giles, Leeds put in a strong promotion challenge and finished fifth, before securing promotion as champions in the 1963\u201364 campaign, topping the table two points ahead of Sunderland. Other players that began to make their mark on the first team included Billy Bremner, Paul Madeley and Peter Lorimer."]}, {"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["Keegan's next visit to Wembley was three months later in the Charity Shield game, the traditional curtain-raiser to a new season, between the League champions and the FA Cup winners. Leeds had decided to niggle at Liverpool, and in particular Keegan, in the match. In one instance Johnny Giles punched the unsuspecting Keegan and was reprieved after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient. Giles, after escaping a red card, then later lunged two-footed at Keegan. Upon Keegan's outraged reaction Billy Bremner challenged Keegan. Keegan then exploded and punched Bremner. Bremner punched back. They were sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match. Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan visibly shaken by the decision. Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Bremner approached Keegan to apologise and was met by the fury of Keegan's father who had come down to check on his son. They both received lengthy bans. The fight was shown that night on BBC television and both were fined \u00a3500, with Keegan being suspended for three games and Bremner eight.  Despite this, Keegan, Bremner and Giles remained good friends outside of football."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["While studying for his O-levels, he began to have difficulty reading the blackboard and was initially devastated when told he would need glasses. At first, his cricket playing suffered, encumbered by the fragile spectacles. However, matters improved when a more robust pair, similar to those glasses worn by cricketer Roy Marshall, were fashioned for him at the behest of his maternal uncle, Albert Speight. Albert would go on to be a strong influence on Boycott's early cricketing gameBooth, p. 5Boycott, pp. 32-37. while playing for Brierley Juniors Football Club. In 1958, Boycott left school with seven O-level passes and the school's Individual Cricket Cup.McKinstry, p. 23. That summer he played for the Leeds United under-18 football team alongside Billy Bremner and attracted the attention of Leeds United scouts. During the winter he continued to play nets with uncle Lawrence.McKinstry, pp. 25\u201326."]}]}}
