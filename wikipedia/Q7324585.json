This younger generation were also drawn to the works of the other Objectivists, and their writings began to be more widely known in Britain.

In 1963, Connie and Tom Pickard started a reading series and bookshop in the Morden Tower Book Room.Geraldine Monk (ed.), CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso all read there. They were soon joined by Richard Caddel, brought up in Kent but an honorary Northumbrian, Barry MacSweeney and Colin Simms. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, Tony Baker, and Tom Pickard in Geraldine Monk (ed.)

Poets David Gascoyne, selected by Jeremy Reed; W. S. Graham, selected by Tony Lopez; David Jones, selected by Drew Milne; J.F. Hendry, selected by Andrew Crozier and Nicholas Moore, selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continued, for some decades, to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of Talisman (1996).Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics 16 (1996): 110-173.

Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line \"Men went to Catraeth\", using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict.

In the early 1990s, he was invited to become editor-in-chief of Votobia Publishers in Olomouc, which became the largest publishing house in Moravia during his tenure. In 1994, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the University of Maine in Orono, where he involved himself more deeply in Ezra Pound scholarship and gathered material for his anthology of New England poets, meeting many of the poets personally. He became good friends especially with Burton Hatlen, Sylvester Pollet, and Carroll F. Terrell, whose works he later translated in more breadth.

Contacts with the British Council brought him in touch with poets Richard Caddel and Stephen Watts, with whom he became friends, translating their verse in Czech. After leaving Votobia in 1998, he co-founded the publishing house Periplum, which specialised in poetry, philosophy and political science.
