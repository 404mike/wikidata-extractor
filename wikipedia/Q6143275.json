Continuing his studies at the Slade School of Art, London, from there he went to Paris.  He returned to Dublin in 1915 to become a teacher at the metropolitan.  He was elected an Associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1917, and he became a member in the same year.  Five years later he went to Florence when he painted portraits and landscapes, finally returning to London where he set up a studio (1927) as a portrait painter and where he was closely associated with William Orpen. Sleator was a member of the Chelsea Arts Club and exhibited at the Royal Academy and with the Royal Society of Portrait Painters.  He taught painting to Winston Churchill, taking over the job from Orpen.  In 1935 he was made an honorary member of the Ulster Arts Club, Belfast.  He kept in touch with his sister Ethel Slator in Belfast and visited her and his friends. He returned from London to Dublin in 1941 and, apart from an occasional journey abroad, remained there until his death (1950).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Irish artists", "response": ["*James Sleator (1889\u20131950) \u2013 artist"]}, {"page": "1950 in Ireland", "response": [":* James Sleator, painter (born in 1889)."]}, {"page": "1889 in Ireland", "response": ["*June \u2013 James Sleator, painter (died 1950)."]}, {"page": "1889 in art", "response": ["* June \u2013 James Sleator, Irish painter (died 1950)"]}, {"page": "1950 in art", "response": ["* James Sleator, Irish painter (b. 1889)"]}, {"page": "List of artists from Northern Ireland", "response": ["*James SleatorSnoddy 2002, pp.613-615 (1889\u20131950)"]}, {"page": "1950 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*James Sleator, painter (born 1889)."]}, {"page": "List of Irish painters", "response": ["* James Sleator (1886\u20131950)"]}, {"page": "Sleator, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Sleator"]}, {"page": "Sleator", "response": ["*James Sleator (1886\u20131950), Irish artist"]}, {"page": "Society of Dublin Painters", "response": ["The Society of Dublin Painters was founded in 1920 by Paul and Grace Henry, Mary Swanzy, Letitia Marion Hamilton, Jack B. Yeats, and Harry Clarke. As the original meeting notes have been lost, there is some uncertainty as to which artists were there at the inaugural meeting. Along with these potential founding members, Clare Marsh, E.M. O\u2019Rourke Dickey, and James Sleator were featured in the first exhibition. The Society held its first exhibition at its premises at 7 St Stephen's Green on 5 August 1920, which ran until 1 September and attracted good reviews. Yeats, Marsh, and Paul Henry were all signatories to the lease of this premises. The group sought to bring modernism to Ireland, and provide a freer, less academic space for artistic expression and experimentation less focused on accuracy and realism. Its foundation was seen as providing an alternative public exhibition space to the more conservative Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA), which did not favour exhibiting Irish modern art. At its 1923 exhibition, Mary Swanzy exhibited one of her earliest cubist paintings, Decoration. The membership always had a large proportion of women."]}, {"page": "Cecil Ffrench Salkeld", "response": ["Cecil Ffrench Salkeld was born in Assam, India on 9 July 1904.
