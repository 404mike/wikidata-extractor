Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart.

Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \"Father Christmas\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. For the following tour, the band recruited ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford and ex\u2013Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon Edwards.
