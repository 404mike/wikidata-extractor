His career has been spent in both Wales and England including top level rugby in Wales and in the Celtic League, winning a number of trophies in both countries.  He has represented Wales from school level to full international honours as well as being selected by the Barbarians.  Despite being tipped as the \"next best thing\" during his early career and being a great points kicker Lee never gained more than a solitary cap for Wales at full international level. After retiring from rugby union as a player, Lee has taken up coaching.
