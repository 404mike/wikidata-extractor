The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 3 June 1607, and published in quarto the same year by the bookseller William Aspley, who issued a second quarto the next year. A revised version of the text was printed in 1641 by the stationer Robert Lunne, with the claim that this text was \"much corrected and amended by the author before his death.\" Scholars have disputed the truth of this claim, though the weight of argument seems to fall in its favor. There are 228 variants between the two versions, \"including thirty long alterations and additions and five excisions; their extent and tone show a concern only an author could feel.\"Logan and Smith, pp. 150\u20131. Some commentators have argued that Chapman revised the original Bussy when writing its sequel, The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois, c. 1610, to make the two works flow together more smoothly. Robert Lunne issued a Q4 iN 1647; Q5 was published by Joshua Kirton in 1657."]}, {"page": "The Constant Maid", "response": ["The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 28 April 1640, along with Shirley's St. Patrick for Ireland, and was published later that year in a quarto printed by J. Raworth for the bookseller Robert Whitaker. In 1657 the play was reissued, in a quarto along with the St. Patrick play, by the bookseller Joshua Kirton. And in 1661 The Constant Maid was reprinted, under its subtitle, and attributed to \"T. B.\"; the title page states that the play was performed by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre\u2014though the inaccuracy of the attribution renders all the assertions of the title page questionable. A fourth edition appeared in 1667 as the work of \"J. S.\" The 1667 title page maintains that the play was \"Acted at the new playhouse called the Nursery, in Hatton Garden,\" reflecting a Restoration revival."]}, {"page": "Thomas Warren", "response": ["Warren was an influential figure in Birmingham at a time when it was a hotbed of creative activity, opening a bookshop in High Street, Birmingham around 1727. From here he founded and published the Birmingham Journal \u2013 the town's first known newspaper; he edited and published Samuel Johnson's first book \u2013 a translation of Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo\u2019s Voyage to Abyssinia\u2014and with Joshua Kirton sold Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone. He also financed the cotton mill established by John Wyatt and Lewis Paul in 1741. This was the world's first mechanised cotton-spinning factory, and was to pave the way for Richard Arkwright's later transformation of the cotton industry during the Industrial Revolution."]}]}}
