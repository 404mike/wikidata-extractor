Itinerant, self-taught portrait-painters such as Ellis and his friends, William Roos and Hugh Hughes found success in the first half of the nineteenth century in Wales and England, at a time before the widespread use of studio portrait photography. This was largely due to the growth of an increasingly prosperous middle-class market who wanted, like the nobility, to own portrait likenesses of themselves. Ellis Owen Ellis' portrait of Morris Hughes as well as his pendant portrait image of the young girl beneath it, is a good example of his spare, comic style. "]}]}}
