At the beginning of the following season, Still was assured by the Dagenham board that no players would be sold; information which he then relayed to his players. In January 2013, striker Dwight Gayle was sold to Championship team Peterborough United for a club-record fee of \u00a3470,000, which left Still feeling \"a bit undermined\". In February 2013, with the Daggers sitting in 16th place in the League Two table, the club was approached by Conference Premier club Luton Town for permission to speak to Still about their vacant managerial job. Still agreed to join Luton, with Dagenham waiving the full compensation fee \"in light of the fantastic job he has done for the [club]\". Before leaving Dagenham, Still was the then-longest serving Football League manager, having spent nine years at the club.", "He has won praise for his man-management and talent spotting skills, especially his ability to discover young players in non-League football at the sixth tier and below, develop them and then sell them \u2013 often for a significant profit. Players that Still has developed that have gone on to play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle. Dagenham & Redbridge managing director Steve Thompson has stated that Still's ability to do this kept the club consistently able to compete while operating on a far smaller budget than its rivals. Still's reputation for nurturing talent, combined with his vast array of contacts within the game gained through decades of coaching, have also led to highly rated young players from Premier League academies joining his teams on loan. Examples include Marlon Pack and Matt Ritchie at Dagenham, and Cameron McGeehan, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu and Elliot Lee at Luton."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["* Current player with most goals \u2013 Dwight Gayle, 34 (as of 12 December 2020)", "* 2017  Jamaal Lascelles,  Jonjo Shelvey,  Dwight Gayle (Championship)"]}, {"page": "EFL Awards", "response": ["* Dwight Gayle"]}, {"page": "List of West Bromwich Albion F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Dwight Gayle"]}, {"page": "PFA Fans' Player of the Year", "response": ["| Championship ||  Dwight Gayle || Newcastle United ||"]}]}}
