During this week, the word \"Incredibox\" was the search term with \"the most significant growth worldwide\", as measured by Google Insights. At that time the success was partly due to the fact that several media like Vice, Jayisgames or Kotaku enjoyed the \"simple\" and \"fun\" concept of Incredibox, while others praised the innovative and creative approach of the interface: Slate's Forrest Wickman wrote that Incredibox was \"wonderfully surreal\", and in the meantime on Gizmodo Eliot Van Buskirk said that \"as a demonstration of outside the box thinking about how to promote a song, Incredibox is impressive\". During the BBC technology show Click on November 17, 2012, Kate Russell described Incredibox as a \"brilliant browser sequencer\" and explained that users \"don\u2019t need to be a musical genius, as it\u2019s pretty much impossible to make something that sounds bad\"."]}]}}
