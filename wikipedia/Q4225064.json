It is a classic story of young girl falling in love with a villain (a smuggler called Will Laud) and suffering the consequences. She stole her employer's horse and rode to London to be with Laud. She was convicted of theft and sentenced to death, but managed to escape. She was recaptured and transported to Australia for life."]}, {"page": "Margaret Catchpole", "response": ["Rev. Richard Cobbold (son of her former employers) made Catchpole the subject of a novel, The History of Margaret Catchpole (London, 1845), which has often been reprinted. The author claims that \"the public may depend upon the truth of the main features of this narrative\" however some discrepancies have since come to light and some writers, including the Rev. M. G. Watkins, author of the memoir in the Dictionary of National Biography, appear to have taken this source too literally.", "*Education: Richard Cobbold made her speak and write as a well-educated woman throughout the book although the evidence is that she was uneducated.", "The Australian children's author, Nance Donkin (born on 7 March 1915 at Maitland, New South Wales: died age 93, on 18 April 2008 at Canterbury, Victoria) wrote Margaret Catchpole (illustrated by Edwina Bell illustrator: Sydney: Collins, 1974). This was an illustrated Young Adult or children's version of the Margaret Catchpole story, about a pioneering convict woman and her life after emancipation, derived largely from Richard Cobbold's biographical Victorian novel, The History of Margaret Catchpole (1845).

There is much evidence against this legend, such as documents apparently referring to the construction of the tower within the twelve years preceding 1569, and it is likely that the tower was constructed by Edmond Latymer as a lookout over Freston Reach of the River Orwell. There are further descriptions suggesting a construction date of 1655."]}, {"page": "Festivals (book)", "response": ["For many of the festivals, the book includes the writings of some famous authors or historical personalities.
