He created a prodigious output by working for such bands, musicians and performers as Peter Hammill, Vivian Stanshall, Generation X, Big Star, Johnny Moped, Whirlwind, Billy Bragg, Clover, the Sinceros, Roger Chapman, Phillip Goodhand-Tait, Dr. Feelgood, Inner City Unit and the Psychedelic Furs. As a result, his work appeared on releases by labels such as Aura, Chiswick, Utility, Go! Discs, Epic, Charisma, CBS, Line Records, United Artists and Riddle Records. His signature style emerged as one that was colourful, playful, loaded with geometry, art-history and music-history references, jokes, cryptograms and symbols. The overriding appetite was for going against the grain of accepted design standards. His work is simultaneously complex in meaning and simple in its delivery.

The band's keyboardist Morgan Fisher, who had taken a break from the band to complete his final year at Hendon County Grammar School, returned in time for involvement in the recording of the album. The album's recording process was brief. Due to their commitments, the band had one day to complete the album. The band was involved in the orchestral arrangements but session musicians were again incorporated as it was deemed the most effective way to utilise their limited time. The band lacked the confidence to compose their own songs so all of the tracks were either cover versions or written by Phillip Goodhand-Tait. Goodhand-Tait first contributed the B-side for \"Everlasting Love\", and when the tapes were complete, more compositions followed for the album. Many of the songs followed the pop formula that brought the band to success, a cause of frustration for the group. The album was released in December 1968 to the UK, but it failed to chart nationally. In 2006, the album was reissued by Repertoire Records with eight bonus-tracks and a 16-page booklet containing an illustrated history of the band."]}, {"page": "World of Music (Mary O'Hara album)", "response": ["#\"Oceans Away\" (Phillip Goodhand-Tait)"]}]}}
