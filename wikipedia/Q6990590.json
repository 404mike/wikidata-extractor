He wrote The Fascinating Foundling, which she directed with other children as actors.Archibald Henderson, George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century, Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p.572 When she was just 14, The Times wrote that \"many members of the House have made the acquaintance of Miss Asquith and in expressing their concern for her health, have referred to her charm of manner and to the interest which she has begun already to show in political matters.\" As a teenager, during World War I, she was given opportunities to do \"good works\", organising and performing in \"matinees\" for the servicemen. Her first known literary effort was a short duologue called \"Off and On\" which she performed with Nelson Keys in 1916 at the Palace Theatre. In the same year she organised a large show of portraits by John Singer Sargent at the Grafton Galleries to aid the Art Fund and a \"Poets' Reading\" in aid of the Star and Garter Fund. In 1918 she played small roles in two silent war movies by D.W.
