Maintaining that the naked body is still a controversial subject, he is most famous for his ten paneled wall sculpture The Great Wall of Vagina, comprising plaster casts taken from 400 volunteers' genitals. Often using the body as inspiration he works with both traditional and novel materials and processes, he explores the human condition and themes of religion, sexuality and death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people educated at Westminster School", "response": ["*Jamie McCartney (born 1971), artist and sculptor"]}, {"page": "Vulva", "response": ["There is a great deal of variation in the appearance of female genitals. Much of this variation lies in the significant differences in the size, shape, and color of the labia minora. Though called the smaller lips they can often be of considerable size and may protrude outside the vagina or labia majora. This variation has also been evidenced in a large display of 400 vulval casts called the Great Wall of Vagina created by Jamie McCartney to fill the lack of information of what a normal vulva looks like. The casts taken from a large and varied group of women showed clearly that there is much variation. Pubic hair also varies in its color, texture, and amount of curl.", "An art installation called The Dinner Party by feminist artist, Judy Chicago, portrays a symbolic history of famous women. The dinner plates each depict an elaborate vulval form and they are arranged in a triangular vulva shape. Another installation was made by British artist Jamie McCartney who used the casts of four hundred vulvas to create The Great Wall of Vagina in 2011. The vagina casts are life-size.  Explanations written by the project's sexual health adviser accompany these. The purpose of the artist was to \"address some of the stigmas and misconceptions that are commonplace\"."]}, {"page": "Great Wall of Vagina", "response": ["#REDIRECTJamie McCartney"]}, {"page": "Labia pride", "response": ["* Jamie McCartney, a British artist best known for his work Great Wall of Vagina"]}, {"page": "101 Vagina", "response": ["* Jamie McCartney"]}, {"page": "Megumi Igarashi", "response": ["* Jamie McCartney, an artist known for the Great Wall of Vagina"]}, {"page": "Vagina and vulva in art", "response": ["Starting in 2006, when \"no one was talking about [vulvas and art]\", Jamie McCartney spent five years creating the work for which he is best known, the Great Wall of Vagina, featuring casts of the vulvas of hundreds of women. The Brighton-based artist began the project in response to the rise in labiaplasty, wanting to provide realistic, non-pornographic portrayals of the widespread variation of anatomy. \"Don't change your parts, change your partner,\" became one of his slogans, along with the over-arching message \u201cYou\u2019re normal. Whatever you\u2019ve got down there, leave it alone.\u201d. By 2015, he said the cultural climate had shifted. \u201cA lot of vagina and vulva artworks are going on. It\u2019s almost like a movement.\" His own project continued to evolve, displaying the Wall at Triennale di Milano museum, and casting more women at the Red Tent Revival festival in the United States."]}]}}
