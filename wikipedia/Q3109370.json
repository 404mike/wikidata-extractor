In the first round, they gained revenge by defeating the Netherlands, with Benedetti defeating Schaar in three sets, and then went on to beat Austria to progress through to their eleventh quarterfinals. Although they soundly lost to the United States in their next match, the team's good results continued through 1975. Rosy Darmon returned to the team, and with her, France was able to easily beat Bulgaria and defeat Hungary despite losing a singles rubber to six-time Hungarian women's tennis champion \u00c9va Szab\u00f3. This allowed them to once again play in their quarterfinals, where they achieved one of their best wins by defeating 1967, 1971 and 1972 finalists and many-time semifinalists Great Britain, with Fuchs managing to stun 1976 French Open champion Sue Barker in three sets and Benedetti and Darmon teaming up to defeat Glynis Coles and multiple Grand Slam doubles winner Virginia Wade in doubles. This allowed the team to reach their fourth semifinal, and become just the fifth team since initiation to reach four semifinals. Although they lost in their next round to Czechoslovakia, whose team was composed of future Grand Slam finalist Ren\u00e1ta Tomanov\u00e1 and the renowned Martina Navratilova, their performance would end up being one of the best for years."]}, {"page": "Mariana Simionescu", "response": ["|  Lesley Charles   Glynis Coles"]}, {"page": "Glynis Coles-Bond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Glynis Coles"]}, {"page": "WTA Swiss Open", "response": ["|1975 ||  Glynis Coles || Linky Boshoff || 9\u20137, 2\u20136, 8\u20136"]}, {"page": "Martina Navratilova career statistics", "response": ["| Sue Barker Glynis Coles"]}, {"page": "Evonne Goolagong Cawley career statistics", "response": ["| Glynis Coles", "*Queensland Grass Court Championships, Brisbane AUS: Champion.
