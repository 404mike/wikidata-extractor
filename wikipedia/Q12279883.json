Michael Balint's \"The Doctor, His Patient and the Illness\" (1957) outlined several case histories in detail and became a seminal text. Their work is continued by the Balint Society, The International Balint Federation and other national Balint societies in other countries. It is one of the most influential works on the topic of doctor\u2013patient relationships. In addition, a Canadian physician known as Sir William Osler was known as one of the \"Big Four\" professors at the time that the Johns Hopkins Hospital was first founded. At the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Osler had invented the world's first medical residency system. In terms of efficacy (i.e. the outcome of treatment), the doctor\u2013patient relationship seems to have a \"small, but statistically significant impact on healthcare outcomes\". However, due to a relatively small sample size and a minimally effective test, researchers concluded additional research on this topic is necessary. Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the UK General Medical Council issued guidance for both of doctors named \"Ethical guidance for doctors\" and for patients \"What to expect from your doctor\" in April 2013"]}, {"page": "Paul Ornstein", "response": ["He wrote Focal Psychotherapy: An Example of Applied Psychoanalysis with Michael Balint and Enid Balint and also edited four volumes of The Search for the Self: Selected Writings of Heinz Kohut.

As a result, Olga left behind a collection of portraits of prominent psychoanalysts from the 20th century."]}]}}
