He exhibited two genre paintings in 1811: A Scotch Wedding and The Reading of the Will, which demonstrate humour and seem to relate to the early work of Wilkie, who painted his own version of the later in 1820. Shortly after this Lizars turned to engraving for a living.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 180\u20131. William Shiels (1785\u20131857) is mainly known as an animal painter, but he also created genre art. James Howe (1780\u20131836) also undertook genre art with an agricultural dimension. Most influenced by Wilkie were his close friends John Burnet (1784\u20131868), William Allan (1782\u20131850), Alexander George Fraser (1786\u20131865) and Andrew Geddes (1783\u20131844). The first three were all contemporaries of Wilkie at the Academy, while Geddes was self-taught. Burnet and Fraser worked closely with Wilkie in London, while Geddes and Allan stayed in touch with him throughout his career. Allan became Master of the Trustees Academy and later President of Royal Scottish Academy and so was able to pass on Wilkie's influence. He produced genre paintings including Christmas Eve (undated), which is a variation on Wilkie's A Penny Wedding.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 181\u20133."]}]}}
