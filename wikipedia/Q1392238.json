His first senior game came against Chesterfield in 1937. When his career was interrupted by the Second World War, he served with the 2nd/4th Lancashires. He helped United win the 1948 FA Cup (scoring in the final) and 1952 league championship. He retired in 1953 with 148 career goals (good for 9th in team history) in 343 appearances; just two goals behind Ruud van Nistelrooy. During his time at Manchester United, he scored five hat-tricks; four in the league and one in the FA Cup. His first came in the 5\u20130 victory over Liverpool in 1946, and in the 1948 FA Cup semi-final he scored all the goals when United won 3\u20131 against Derby County at Hillsborough in Sheffield. His hat-trick against Liverpool in September 1946 occurred at Maine Road (due to bomb damage to Old Trafford), and would be the last hat-trick by a Manchester United player against the Anfield club until September 2010, when Bulgarian Dimitar Berbatov scored all three of United's goals in a 3\u20132 league win at Old Trafford.Pearson went on to average more than one goal every two games in three years at Bury before his playing career ended with two years at Chester from 1957 to 1959. At 40 years, 101 days, Pearson remains the oldest player to make a Football League appearance for the club when he played his final match against Crewe Alexandra on 22 April 1959.Upon his retirement, Pearson was a popular appointment as Chester manager after John Harris moved to Sheffield United. Despite making signings such as his former Manchester United colleague Frank Clempson, Chester struggled during Pearson's reign in charge. After finishing 20th and 24th in successive Division Four seasons, Pearson left the club following a 1\u20130 home defeat to non-league Morecambe in November 1961 in the FA Cup.\nAfter retiring from football Pearson became sub-postmaster of Prestbury Post Office in Cheshire. He died at Alderley Edge, Cheshire, in February 1997, aged 78.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chester", "response": ["Notable former players of the club include Ian Rush (who later managed the club), Cyrille Regis, Arthur Albiston, Earl Barrett, Lee Dixon, Steve Harkness, Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Stan Pearson."]}, {"page": "Chester City F.C.", "response": ["* Stan Pearson (Apr 1959 \u2013 Nov 1961)", "*Oldest league appearance\u00a0\u2013 40 yrs, 101 days Stan Pearson (April 1959)", "|align=center|Stan Pearson (England international)"]}, {"page": "Football in England", "response": ["The English national team suffered two shock defeats in the early 1950s: a 1\u20130 loss to the United States at the 1950 World Cup and a 6\u20133 defeat to Hungary at Wembley in 1953. However, Wolverhampton Wanderers defeated the Hungarian club Budapest Honv\u00e9d, a match which inspired the creation of the European Cup. Chelsea were dissuaded from participating in the first season of the European Cup in 1955\u201356, but Manchester United ignored such advice and went on to reach the semi-final of the 1956\u201357 edition, losing to the eventual winners Real Madrid.

Nicholson is quoted as saying \"My duty is to get fit for Tottenham. Well, they pay my wages, don't they?\". Of his only appearance he said \"Stan Pearson nodded it back and I ran on to let go a first time shot which, from the moment I hit it, I knew was going in.

He then had to wait five years for his fourth cap, in which time the England selectors had tried 17 different players at inside-forward, with limited success. Selectors had always viewed the rebellious Shackleton with distrust, and one selector who was challenged over Shackleton's continued absence in the England team told a journalist that \"we play at Wembley, not the London Palladium.\" He made his return again against Wales, in a 3\u20132 victory at Wembley Stadium. He put in his finest performance however in his final England appearance, scoring with a chipped goal in a 3\u20131 win over the then World Champions West Germany on 1 December 1954. He later wrote that the goal was \"my most memorable scoring effort in a lifetime of soccer... I felt a keen sense of satisfaction \u2013 not because the goal made our victory over Germany certain, but because I had decided exactly how to go about scoring it long before the chance presented itself.
