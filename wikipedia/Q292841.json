She also lived in Australia and the United States.\n\nShe studied medicine at the University of Bristol and later specialized in high altitude medicine. At age 25 she climbed Denali, the highest mountain in North America. It was the first of her series of climbs of the highest peaks on all seven continents, which included Mount Everest on 7 October 1993, making her only the second British woman to climb Everest, after Rebecca Stephens.On 1 December 1995 she became the third woman, and the first British woman, to climb all seven continental summits inclusive of Kosciuszko, the highest mountain in mainland Australia. On the same date she also became the fifth woman, and the second British woman (behind Rebecca Stephens), to climb all seven continental summits inclusive of the Carstensz Pyramid in Australasia.On 18 May 1998, she climbed Kangchenjunga by its north face, making her the first woman to have reached the summit of the world's third highest mountain.  Her obituary in The Guardian quotes her as \"She watched in sorrow as other climbers she knew were lost \u2013 Alison Hargreaves, Chantal Mauduit \u2013 and wrote of her historic ascent: \"Over the years four women had died while attempting to climb Kangchenjunga and it made me appreciate all the more how lucky I was to make the first female ascent and return safely.\"She later became the first British woman to summit Makalu on 22 May 1999.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kangchenjunga", "response": ["* 1998 Ginette Harrison was the first woman who climbed Kangchenjunga North face."]}, {"page": "List of climbers and mountaineers", "response": ["* Ginette Harrison (1958\u20131999) UK, Seven Summits, first female ascent Kangchenjunga (1998), killed on Dhaulagiri"]}, {"page": "Dhaulagiri", "response": ["* 1999 \u2013 On 24 October, British climber Ginette Harrison dies in an avalanche on Dhaulagiri. Days later, Slovenian Toma\u017e Humar climbs the south face solo but does not reach the summit. His ascent ended at 7,300 m due to a 300 m band of rotten rock. Humar traverses to the dangerous southeast ridge, re-enters the face briefly, and exits at 8000 m for a descent on the northeast ridge. Dhaulagiri's south face is still unclimbed, making it one of the greatest remaining challenges in alpinism."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 1999", "response": ["*Ginette Harrison, 41, British climber, climbing accident."]}]}}
