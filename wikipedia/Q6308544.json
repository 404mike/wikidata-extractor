Both films were based on plays cowrittened by Ivor Novello, Graham Cutts, Constance Collier and Reginald Fogwell. Jeans also returned to reprise her role from the first film, as did Marie Ault and Julie Suedo. A notable absence is the character of Odile, a central figure in The Rat as played by Mae Marsh.  At the end of the previous film Pierre had seemingly rejected the lure of life in high society as represented by the Jeans character of Z\u00e9lie, and he and Odile had finally realised the depth of their love for each other. However The Triumph of the Rat finds him back with Z\u00e9lie, and not only does Odile not appear in the film, but not even a passing mention is made as to what might have happened in the interim to cause her to disappear so completely from Pierre's life.  This reportedly puzzled contemporary audiences, and while some later observers have theorised that The Triumph of the Rat is meant to present an alternative reality in which Pierre chose Z\u00e9lie over Odile at the end of the original film, there is no evidence that anything so sophisticated was ever the intention.", "* Julie Suedo as Mou Mou"]}, {"page": "The Fake (1927 film)", "response": ["*Julie Suedo as Dancer "]}, {"page": "The Vortex (film)", "response": ["* Julie Suedo - Anna Vollof"]}, {"page": "The White Sheik (1928 film)", "response": ["* Julie Suedo as Zarita"]}, {"page": "The Physician (1928 film)", "response": ["*Julie Suedo as Lady Valerie Camille "]}, {"page": "Our Fighting Navy", "response": ["* Julie Suedo as Juanita "]}, {"page": "The Villiers Diamond", "response": ["* Julie Suedo as Mrs Forbes"]}, {"page": "One Colombo Night", "response": ["* Julie Suedo as Lalla"]}, {"page": "Afterwards (1928 film)", "response": ["Afterwards is a 1928 British silent drama film directed by Lawson Butt and starring Marjorie Hume, Julie Suedo and Joseph R.
