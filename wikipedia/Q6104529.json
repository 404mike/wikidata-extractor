Scott Kelso (born 1947 in Derry, Northern Ireland) is an American neuroscientist, and Professor of Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, Professor of Psychology, Biological Sciences and Biomedical Science at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in Boca Raton, Florida and The University of Ulster (Magee Campus) in Derry, N. Ireland.\nKelso has worked on coordination dynamics, the science of coordination and on fundamental mechanisms underlying voluntary movements and their relation to the large-scale coordination dynamics of the human brain.\nHis experimental research in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to the HKB model (Haken\u2013Kelso\u2013Bunz), a mathematical formulation that quantitatively describes and predicts how elementary forms of coordinated behavior arise and change adaptively as a result of nonlinear interactions among components.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Self-organization", "response": ["* J.

A. Scott Kelso and fellow researchers at  Florida Atlantic University to provide experimental results for the theory of social coordination dynamics.  In Kelso's experiments, two subjects were separated by an opaque barrier and asked to wag their fingers; then the barrier was removed and the subjects were instructed to continue to wag their fingers as if no change had occurred.  After a short period, the movements of the two subjects sometimes became coordinated and synchronized (but other times continued to be asynchronous).  The link between EEG and conscious social interaction is described as Phi, one of several brain rhythms operating in the 10\u00a0Hz range.  Phi consists of two components: one to favor solitary behavior and another to favor interactive (interpersonal) behavior.  Further analysis of Phi may reveal the social and interpersonal implications of degenerative diseases such as schizophrenia\u2014or may provide insight into common social relationships such as the dynamics of alpha and omega-males or the popular bystander effect describing how people diffuse personal responsibility in emergency situations depending on the number of other individuals present.", "Although the concept of metastability has been around in Neuroscience for some time,J. A. Scott Kelso (1991) Behavioral and neural pattern generation: the concept of neurobehavioral dynamical system (NBDS). In: Koepchen HP (ed) Cardiorespiratory and motor coordination.Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York. the specific interpretation of metastability in the context of brain operations of different complexity has been developed by Andrew and Alexander Fingelkurts within their model of Operational Architectonics of brain\u2013mind functioning. Metastability is basically a theory of how global integrative and local segregative tendencies coexist in the brain.Kaplan AYa (1998) Nonstationary EEG: methodological and experimental analysis. Usp Fiziol Nauk (Success in Physiological Sciences) 29:35\u201355 (in Russian). The Operational Architectonics is centered on the fact that in the metastable regime of brain functioning, the individual parts of the brain exhibit tendencies to function autonomously at the same time as they exhibit tendencies for coordinated activity. In accordance with Operational Architectonics, the synchronized operations produced by distributed neuronal assemblies constitute the metastable spatial-temporal patterns. They are metastable because intrinsic differences in the activity between neuronal assemblies are sufficiently large that they each do their own job (operation), while still retaining a tendency to be coordinated together in order to realize the complex brain operation.Fingelkurts AnA, Fingelkurts AlA (2005) Mapping of the brain operational architectonics.
