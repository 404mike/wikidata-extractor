Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something \"smarter, neater more classy\".

The album was released by EMI and Harvest on the then-new compact disc format in Japan in June 1983, in the US and Europe in August 1984, and in 1992 it was re-released as a remastered CD in the box set Shine On. This version was re-released as a 20th anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year. The cover design was again by Storm Thorgerson, the designer of the original 1973 cover. On some pressings, a faintly audible orchestral version of the Beatles' \"Ticket to Ride\" can be heard after \"Eclipse\" over the album's closing heartbeats.", "The original quadraphonic mix, created by Alan Parsons, was commissioned by EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1\u00a0channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters' In the Flesh for SACD.  Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was \"possibly a little too true to the original mix\", but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and has since sold more than 800,000\u00a0copies. The cover image was created by a team of designers including Storm Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the \"sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound\u00a0...\" The image was created out of a desire to be \"the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new\".", "Category:Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson"]}, {"page": "2013", "response": ["* April 18 \u2013 Storm Thorgerson, British graphic designer (b. 1944)"]}, {"page": "Houses of the Holy", "response": ["Page has stated that the album cover was the second version submitted by Hipgnosis.

Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve \u2013 censoring the cover image \u2013 and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art \"absent\").
