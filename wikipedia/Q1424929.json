Debutant Kirk Shepherd, a 21-year-old qualifier and the sport's youngest ever world-finalist, was Part's opponent. In a sense, Part's career had come full circle; the matchup recalled his 1994 final, though Part had moved from novice to established veteran and Shepherd, this time, was the young debutant. But Part was not to suffer the same fate as Bobby George had. While Shepherd had shown remarkable guile, moxie and perhaps good fortune in defeating stalwarts of the PDC's top 10, including Mardle, Peter Manley, and Terry Jenkins, the experience of Part proved a step too far. The Canadian raced into a 4\u20130 lead and though Shepherd brought the match back to 5\u20132, Part closed out the match before the comeback could become troubling, winning the final two sets for a 7\u20132 victory and a third world championship. Victory ensured he joined Taylor, van Barneveld, Eric Bristow and John Lowe as the fifth player to have won more than two world championships. With this win he also became the second player to have won the PDC World Championship more than once, after Taylor. Part also set a new record in becoming the first player to win the world championship in three different venues \u2013 having won the 1994 BDO World Championship at the Lakeside, the 2003 PDC title at the Circus Tavern and in 2008 at Alexandra Palace.", "Part was defeated in the first round of the 2009 World Championship, losing 3\u20130 to American Bill Davis \u2013 the second time in which Part has lost his first match in the World Championship, having won the title the previous year (he was knocked out by Mark Dudbridge in 2004 having won the title in 2003). Part was defeated by Kirk Shepherd in the second round of the 2010 World Championship in a repeat of the 2008 final, only recording a 76 average in a 4\u20131 loss.
