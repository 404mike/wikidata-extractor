The first limited-overs tournament between first-class English teams was the Midlands Knock-Out Cup, which took place in May 1962. Played with 65-over innings, the Cup was organised by Mike Turner, secretary of the Leicestershire County Cricket Club. The competition was small, with three other county teams participating in addition to Leicestershire. However, it drew commercial television coverage and positive commentary by journalists, who noted the potential to attract sponsors and spectators amid declining attendance levels."]}, {"page": "Michael Turner", "response": ["Michael or Mike Turner may refer to:", "*Mike Turner (musician) (born 1963), former and founding band member of alternative rock band Our Lady Peace", "*Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (born 1987), member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives", "*Mike Turner (Tennessee politician) (born 1955), Tennessee politician in the Tennessee House of Representatives", "*Mike Turner (born 1960), American politician from Ohio", "*Mike Turner (cricketer) (1934\u20132015), English cricketer", "*Mike Turner (footballer) (born 1938), English former football goalkeeper", "*Mike Turner (footballer, born 1976), Born in Liverpool, played for Barnsley, Plymouth Argyle and Doncaster Rovers.
