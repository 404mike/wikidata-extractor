Hampshire played their first first-class match at the ground in thirteen years in that season when they played Leicestershire, which Hampshire won by 3 wickets, due in part to a five wicket haul from Jimmy Wootton and an unbeaten half century from Francis Quinton. Over the coming seasons, Hampshire tended to play two to three matches there per season.  An 1897 fixture between Hampshire and Sussex saw Arthur Webb score Hampshire's first first-class century, while a match the following season which saw Surrey as the visitors drew a crowd of around 5,000. The ground Naval connection saw services players bought into the Hampshire team on occasion, including Admiral Hotham. The early 1900s saw little success for Hampshire at the ground, with the county winning just two of eighteen matches played at the ground from 1900 to 1907.  Considered a weak Hampshire team at the time, the county finished last in the County Championship in 1900 and 1902\u20131905, it wasn't until 1907 that Hampshire won again at the ground thanks to 88 and 6/55 from Phil Mead against Somerset.

He was found shot through the top of his head in the lavatory of a first-class carriage of a train from London at Reading station on 22 December 1922. The inquest was told by his older brother Francis Quinton that James had been depressed after a bout of influenza and had been unreasonably worried over a mistake in his membership of a London club, an apparently trivial matter which he had seen as a potential disgrace for himself and his family. The coroner returned a verdict of \"Suicide during temporary insanity\".
