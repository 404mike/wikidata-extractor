With Wellington's army divided, Soult concentrated his army and made several attempts to overcome Hope's now outnumbered troops. The counter-attacks occurred over a three-day period starting on 10 December. After the failure of his initial assault, Soult attacked again on both 12 and 13 December, and on each occasion he succeeded in pushing Hope back. Wellington was thus obliged each time to send reinforcements to drive the French back to Bayonne. On the night of the 12th, the river flooded due to heavy rain, and destroyed the British pontoon bridge at Villefranque, leaving Hill stranded on the north side of the river. Despite being attacked by six of Soult's divisions, Hill's line held until Wellington's 6th Division arrived four hours later, having crossed the river at Ustaritz. Beresford meanwhile had sent three divisions across the river at Villefranque, forcing the French to retreat to Bayonne.

Audacious escorted the army of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore from the Downs to Sweden to fight in the Finnish War, but disagreements with Gustav IV Adolf meant that Gosselin and Audacious escorted Moore's army back in July. In August Gosselin convoyed a large body of troops to Portugal with Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Burrard as his personal guest on Audacious, as the general went to supersede Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. After debarking the soldiers, Gosselin joined Vice-Admiral Cotton off the Tagus. Gosselin and Audacious continued there until the retreat of the army of Lieutenant-General Moore to Corunna in January 1809, when he assisted in escorting the transports carrying Moore's army back to Britain. The same month, Gosselin received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for his unremitted exertions in doing so. The army dispatches on the Battle of Corunna were written by Lieutenant-General John Hope, Moore having been killed, on board Audacious. Gosselin resigned his command of Audacious in March 1809 and was subsequently appointed to command the ship-of-the-line HMS Cressy when she was launched in 1810, but Gosselin declined the command on the grounds of ill health."]}]}}
