He was a prolific jazz and orchestra composer. He led many bands, from small ensembles to night club bands to orchestras. He worked with Latin American and Jamaican bands, including Kenny Graham's Afro-Cubists and Mike McKenzie (jazz musician)'s Quartet. He played with the Carl Barriteau orchestra, the Decca Records house band under Phil Green, and occasionally the Glenn Miller band. Wright was voted the 1980 BBC Jazz Society Musician of the Year.\nDuring his career, he worked with St\u00e9phane Grappelli, Lonnie Donegan, Johnny Duncan, Digby Fairweather, Ella Fitzgerald, Ken Snakehips Johnson, Billy Eckstine, Fapy Lafertin, Russ Conway, Bir\u00e9li Lagr\u00e8ne, Humphrey Lyttelton, Nigel Kennedy, and George Shearing.\nAlthough best known as a guitarist, his favourite instrument was piano, the only musical instrument he would play at home.

Grappelli's reservations about returning to this format were dissipated following a rapturous reception for the \"new\" (old) format group at that year's Cambridge Folk Festival, after which he favoured the guitar-based trio (with double bass) for a series of increasingly successful concert tours around the globe. These tours would virtually occupy the remainder of Grappelli's life; away from the touring circuit, however, he also favoured numerous other instrumental combinations on record. Other guitarists in the British \"Diz Disley Trio\" providing his instrumental backing over the years included Denny Wright, Ike Isaacs, the Irish guitarist Louis Stewart, John Etheridge and Martin Taylor, while double bass was often provided by Dutchman Jack Sewing; in his later years, Grappelli also used a Parisian trio which included guitarist Marc Fosset and bassist Patrice Carratini.", "* I Got Rhythm!

In 1955 he emigrated to England, and found himself much in demand for television scores.

Before this, Grappelli had spent a number of years playing \"cocktail jazz\" in a Paris hotel. After a couple of \"warm up\" gigs in small folk clubs, they played together to an unexpectedly warm reception at the 1973 Cambridge Folk Festival with Denny Wright on second acoustic guitar. This began a collaboration between Grappelli and the Diz Disley Trio, sometimes billed The Hot Club of London, with tours of Australia, Europe, and the United States. Karl Dallas reported Disley as having \"single-handedly created a revival of interest in the music of Stephane Grappelli, which has taken him to Carnegie Hall, Australia, and New Zealand\" (the latter in September 1974). \"...the night he closed at the Palladium, he went to The Troubadour where he was booked later that night to perform his folk club act of idiocy and mayhem, keeping up the tradition he has built up over the past 20 years for delivering a shrewd mixture of musical brilliance and vocal insanity.\"Karl Dallas, Melody Maker, July 27, 1974, \"Disley - still making whoopee\" There were a few changes in line-up with Ike Isaacs, Louis Stewart, and John Etheridge alternating as second guitarist. The Disley Trio accompanied Grappelli for another five years until Disley was forced to take a break in 1979 after breaking his wrist when he was knocked down by a motorcycle in London. His replacement was a young Martin Taylor, who toured with Grappelli for ten years. During that period, Disley continued to play folk clubs and festivals as a solo performer and also mentored a young Chris Newman, who would establish his own name in the swing jazz, guitar flatpicking and celtic folk guitar fields.", "In 1984 Disley was instrumental in forming a club quintet for Nigel Kennedy, who was starting to explore other musical styles. Musicians with Kennedy were Jeff Green, Ian Cruickshank, Nils Solberg (guitars), and Dave Etheridge (bass), who had played with Disley and Denny Wright on their 1973 tour with Grappelli. In 1986, Disley formed the Soho String Quintette with Johnny Van Derrick (violin), Nils Solberg, Jeff Green, and David Etheridge.
