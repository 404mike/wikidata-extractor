In March 2008, he was loaned to Swansea City, and after helping them win League One title, signed for a then club record \u00a3400,000. He amassed 352 appearances for the Swans, scoring 14 goals. He aided them in their promotion to the Premier League and their victory in the 2013 Football League Cup Final.\nIn August 2016, he signed a three-year contract with fellow Premier League side Everton for a fee of \u00a312 million. Williams was a regular in his first season at Goodison Park but eventually fell out of favour and he spent the 2018\u201319 season on loan at Stoke City. Upon his release by Everton, Williams signed a short-term deal with Bristol City in August 2019 which was extended in November of that year. He left the club at the end of the 2019\u201320 season and announced his retirement in January 2021 at the age of 36.\nBorn in England, Williams qualified to play for Wales through his maternal grandfather. He made his debut for them in March 2008 and earned 86 caps, scoring twice.

His first match in charge was a friendly against Hungary on 9 February 2005 which ended in a 2\u20130 win for Wales, both goals being scored by Craig Bellamy. His first competitive match in charge came one month later when they suffered a 2\u20130 defeat to Austria, where Toshack was blamed for making a late substitution with the match at 0\u20130 that allowed Austria into contention and conceded two late goals.

A minute's silence was to be held before the match. However, the fans applauded instead and sang Speed's name. Several players who played in the match were severely affected by the news. Four Welsh internationals played in the match; Ashley Williams, Neil Taylor and Joe Allen, of Swansea, all played under Speed for Wales, and Allen in particular was said to be struggling with the news. James Collins was the other Welsh international, and he had also played with Speed at international level. Collins' Villa teammates Shay Given and Jermaine Jenas had both played with Speed at Newcastle United, and both were badly affected by the news. Given openly wept during and after the minute's applause. Both managers, Alex McLeish and Brendan Rodgers, paid tribute to Speed.

While the decision baffled some pundits, the Swansea chairman argued that Guidolin's achievements at Udinese on a relatively small budget were similar to what the club was trying to achieve. At the time of his appointment, Guidolin was virtually unknown to the English game and club captain Ashley Williams later admitted that he had to \"Google\" his new manager."]}, {"page": "Bojan Krki\u0107", "response": ["Bojan returned from injury in July 2015 playing in a pre-season friendly against Brentford.

Bojan signed a new contract with Stoke in February committing him to the club until the summer of 2020.

City then went ten games unbeaten through November and December but made little progress up the table as Stoke drew six of them, conceding late equalisers on three occasions. Stoke's run was ended by another defeat to Birmingham on Boxing Day. After poor results against Bolton Wanderers and Bristol City supporters began to call for Rowett's departure.
