He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare's maturity as a playwright, and that its \"Thesean harmony\" reflects proper decorum of character. He also viewed Bottom as the best-drawn character, with his self-confidence, authority, and self-love. He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race. Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text, rather than acted on stage. He found the writing to be \"subtle and ethereal\", and standing above literary criticism and its reductive reasoning."]}, {"page": "Edward II of England", "response": ["Historians in the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries focused on Edward's relationship with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign and the events surrounding the relationship of Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, Duke of \u00c9pernon, and Henry III of France, and between George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and Charles I of England. In the first half of the 19th\u00a0century, popular historians such as Charles Dickens and Charles Knight popularised Edward's life with the Victorian public, focusing on the king's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality. From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th\u00a0century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons. Views on his sexuality have continued to develop over the years."]}, {"page": "Titus Andronicus", "response": ["However, despite the fact that so many Shakespearean scholars believed the play to have been written by someone other than Shakespeare, there were those throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century who argued against this theory. One such scholar was Edward Capell, who, in 1768, said that the play was badly written but asserted that Shakespeare did write it. Another major scholar to support Shakespeare's authorship was Charles Knight in 1843. Several years later, a number of prominent German Shakespeareans also voiced their belief that Shakespeare wrote the play, including A.W. Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.See Vickers (2002: 150\u2013156) for a summary of the pre 20th century pro and anti-Shakespearean arguments."]}, {"page": "Mason Jackson", "response": ["In the middle of the 19th century, Jackson's prints for The Art Union gave him a considerable reputation, along with Charles Knight's Shakespeare and other standard books.

At the request of the publisher Charles Knight, in 1849 she wrote The History of the Thirty Years' Peace, 1816\u20131846, an excellent popular history from the point of view of a \"philosophical Radical\". Martineau spanned a wide variety of subject matter in her writing and did so with more assertiveness than was expected of women at the time.

The play contains several narrative inconsistencies uncharacteristic of Shakespeare, an unusually unsatisfying d\u00e9nouement, drastically different styles in different places and an unusually large number of long lines which don't scan. One theory is that the play as it appears in the First Folio is unfinished.  E.K. Chambers believes Shakespeare began the play, but abandoned it due to a mental breakdown, never returning to finish it. F.W. Brownlow believes the play to have been Shakespeare's last, and remained uncompleted at his death. A more predominant theory, however, is one proposed by Charles Knight in 1838: the play was a collaboration between Shakespeare and at least one other dramatist. Today, many scholars believe that other dramatist was Thomas Middleton. However, the exact nature of the collaboration is disputed. Did Middleton revise a piece begun by Shakespeare, did Shakespeare revise Middleton's work, or did they work together? John Jowett, editor of the play for both the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works and the individual Oxford Shakespeare edition, believes Middleton worked with Shakespeare in an understudy capacity and wrote scenes 2 (1.2 in editions which divide the play into acts), 5 (3.1), 6 (3.2), 7 (3.3), 8 (3.4), 9 (3.5), 10 (3.6) and the last eighty lines of 14 (4.3)."]}, {"page": "Timon of Athens", "response": ["was proposed by Charles Knight in 1838."]}, {"page": "1833 in science", "response": ["* Publication by Charles Knight of The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge begins in London."]}, {"page": "English Cyclopaedia", "response": ["The English Cyclopaedia: A new dictionary of universal knowledge (London, 1854\u20131862, 4to, 23 vols., 12,117 pages; supplements, 1869\u20131873, 4 vols., 2858 pages), was published by Charles Knight, based on the Penny Cyclopaedia, of which he had the copyright.

The Society set out to achieve this by acting as an intermediary between authors and publishers by launching several series of publications. Its printers included Baldwin & Cradock, later succeeded by Charles Knight. The SDUK commissioned work and dealt with the printers, and finally distributed the publications; profits were used to continue the Society's work. By using the new technologies of mass production, such as steam presses and stereotype, the Society and its printers kept costs low and were able to sell the books at much cheaper prices than was usual.James A.

The fabric of the building was also allowed to deteriorate; pieces of falling masonry were said to be a danger to the sentries. In 1745, King George II commissioned a new building in the fashionable Palladian style by the architect William Kent. Having to reuse the same plot of land, Kent managed to retain essentially the same plan as the original building while doubling the interior space. Kent died in April 1748 before  the old Horse Guards had been demolished; work on the new building commenced in 1750 under the direction of Kent's assistant, John Vardy and William Robinson from the Office of Works. The cost of the buildings was \u00a365,000 and took nearly ten years to complete. The Household Cavalry moved into the northern wing of the uncompleted building in 1755; at that time, there was stabling for 62 horses compared to 17 today. Originally, the two wings were connected to the central block by single storey ranges; in 1803-5 a further two floors were added to these, giving the building its present appearance. Kent's decision to retain a Baroque clock tower on his new Palladian building resulted in a peculiar blend of styles, perhaps the cause of it being described by Charles Knight as \"the ugliest building in the metropolis\".Stocqueler 1873, p. 8"]}, {"page": "Hoop rolling", "response": ["In England, children are known to have played the game as early as the 15th century.The Pictorial History of England vol. 2,  by George Lillie Craik, Charles Knight, Charles MacFarlane, Harriet Martineau; p. 263 By the late 18th century, boys driving hoops in the London streets had become a nuisance, according to Joseph Strutt.
