Our countrymen were too much riveted to the principles of the Linnaean school to appreciate the value of the natural system ... There was a general repugnance to everything that appeared like an innovation on the system of Linnaeus; and for many years ... zoology, which was making rapid strides in France and other parts of the Continent, remained in this country nearly stationary. It is mainly to Dr Leach that we are indebted for having opened the eyes of English zoologists to the importance of those principles which had long guided the French naturalists. Whilst he greatly contributed to the advancement of the natural system by his own researches, he gave a turn to those of others, and made the first step towards weaning his countrymen from the school they had so long adhered to.'"]}, {"page": "Francis Blomefield", "response": ["In 1871, Blomefield's property \u2013 worth more than \u00a37000 \u2013 was inherited by a distant cousin, clergyman and naturalist Leonard Jenyns.

Beagle, and was now working on a book of notes on observations of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that \"work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or \u0153conomy of nature\u00a0.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited.\" He told Jenyns that he had \"continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years.\" In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him \"With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides to the question of the immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals).\" He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about \"numerous immense difficulties on my notions\" told him that he had \"drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic.\" Jenyns never took up this offer to read the \"Essay\", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term \"mutation\".

He was grieved to have received a message that Ramsay had died. This upset Darwin's plans for a visit in the following year to Tenerife. He arrived home at The Mount, Shrewsbury, on 29 August, and found a letter from John Stevens Henslow. The Cambridge Fellow George Peacock had heard from Francis Beaufort of plans for the second survey voyage of HMS Beagle, and had written to Henslow proposing Leonard Jenyns as \"a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition\", or if he was unavailable seeking recommendations for an alternative to take up this \"glorious opportunity\". When Jenyns decided not to leave his parish, he and Henslow thought of Darwin. Henslow's letter, read by Peacock and forwarded to Darwin, expected him to eagerly catch at the likely offer of a two-year trip to Terra del Fuego & home by the East Indies, not as \"a finished Naturalist\", but as a gentleman \"amply qualified for collecting, observing, & noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History\".
