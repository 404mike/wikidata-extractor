He was also known as a tandem and trike rider and an ingenious creator of specialist adaptations for disabled cyclists.  Longstaff died of a heart attack while piloting his tandem trike on a Longstaff Owners' Club ride.  \nThe Longstaff Cycle Centre has contracted, but is still in business and continues to build custom bikes, but  no longer retails off-the-peg cycles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["| Dr. George Longstaff", "| Dr. George Longstaff", "| Dr. George Longstaff"]}, {"page": "Longstaff", "response": ["*George Longstaff (c. 1947\u20132003), British bicycle and tricycle builder"]}, {"page": "Longstaff, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Longstaff"]}, {"page": "Wandsworth (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=3| George Longstaff"]}]}}
