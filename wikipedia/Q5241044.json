After less than three years he was transferred back to Charlton Athletic, alongside David Whyte in exchange for Darren Pitcher. Under the management of former teammate Alan Curbishley, Mortimer often played well in the early part of the season but then suffered hamstring  or back injuries. At the start of the successful promotion winning 1997\u201398 season, against Bradford City he scored a spectacular goal where he turned his full back inside out before a shot to the bottom right of the goal. In this game Charlton won 4\u20131, and it was a performance that hailed of things to come that season. After helping the club into the Premier League in 1998, he again played in the country's top-flight missing a crucial penalty against Leeds United towards the end of the season. He left the following year, moving to lower league side Bristol City where he ended his career in 2001. At Bristol City, he scored once; his goal coming in a League Cup tie against Cambridge United."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Football League", "response": ["|align=center| =|| David Whyte || Charlton Athletic ||align=center| 18"]}, {"page": "List of Charlton Athletic F.C. seasons", "response": ["|David Whyte", "|Carl Leaburn  David Whyte"]}, {"page": "1996 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["David Whyte had a second-half goal disallowed for Charlton after he was adjudged to have been offside.
