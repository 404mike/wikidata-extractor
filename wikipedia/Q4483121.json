She was the third of four children to Roy Ferris, a dairyman and Dorothy Philomena. Raised in central London, she attended Francis Holland School and was a member of the Mermaids Swimming Club which was notable for training female athletes for the Olympics. Ferris won a bronze Olympic medal in the women's 3 metre springboard event at the 1960 Rome Summer Olympics.\nAfter her diving career, she worked in medicine and was an advocate for changing perceptions of women in sport. Her efforts were recognised by an Olympic order medal in 1980 and a lifetime achievement award by the British Olympic Association in 2011. Ferris's legacy was in her steadfast work to enhance women's opportunities in the Olympic games, as well as her work on gender biology, which encouraged the IOC to revise their definition of male and female bodies.\nFerris had one daughter to husband Julian Steven. She suffered with breast cancer from 2008 and died at home four years later in April 2012. At the time of her death, no other British female diver had won an Olympic medal in diving since her bronze medal in 1960.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1960 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Elizabeth Ferris \u2014 Diving, Women's 3m Springboard"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 12 April \u2013 Elizabeth Ferris, 71, Olympic bronze medal-winning (1960) diver."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2012", "response": ["*Elizabeth Ferris, 71, British Olympic bronze medal-winning (1960) diver."]}, {"page": "Liz Ferris", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Ferris (diver)"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Anne Esther Ferris", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Ferris (diver)"]}, {"page": "Ferris, Elizabeth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Ferris (diver)"]}, {"page": "British Diving Championships - springboard diving winners", "response": ["| Elizabeth Ferris", "|Elizabeth Ferris"]}, {"page": "British Diving Championships - plain diving winners", "response": ["| Elizabeth Ferris", "| Elizabeth Ferris"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Ferris", "response": ["Elizabeth Ferris may refer to:", "*Elizabeth Ferris (diver) (1940\u20132012), British diver", "*Elizabeth Ferris (wheelchair rugby) (born c. 1986), wheelchair rugby player "]}, {"page": "Elisabeth Ferris", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Ferris (diver)"]}]}}
