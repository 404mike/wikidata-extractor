He sat in the House of Commons in 1885.\nAt the  1880 general election he stood unsuccessfully in the borough of Gloucester.\nA petition was lodged against the election of the two Liberal Party candidates, which led to one of the two returns being voided. However, the writ was suspended, and no by-election was held.In 1885, a vacancy arose in the Western division of Gloucestershire, when the Liberal MP Robert Kingscote was appointed as Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues. Ackers was selected as the Conservative candidate for the resulting by-election, which was held  on 12 March 1885. He won the seat with a majority of 411 votes (4.4% of the total) over his Liberal opponent.Constituencies were radically revised by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and at the general election in November 1885 Ackers contested the new Thornbury division.\nHe was defeated by a margin of 145 votes by the Liberal Stafford Howard.Ackers was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Gloucestershire in 1903.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: A", "response": ["|Benjamin St John Ackers"]}, {"page": "West Gloucestershire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Benjamin St John Ackers"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Benjamin St John Ackers; MP for West Gloucestershire (1885)"]}, {"page": "Ackers", "response": ["* Benjamin St John Ackers (1839\u20131915), British Member of Parliament (MP) for West Gloucestershire, 1885"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|Benjamin St John Ackers"]}, {"page": "Benjamin St. John Ackers", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin St John Ackers"]}, {"page": "List of UK Parliamentary election petitions", "response": ["| 1885 || Thornbury || Benjamin St John Ackers || Edward Stafford Howard || Bribery, etc.; Rioting and intimidation; counting ballot papers which were void || Duly elected || Organised bands came into the constituency and attacked Ackers' committee rooms as well as homes, but most electors in the affected areas voted anyway.
