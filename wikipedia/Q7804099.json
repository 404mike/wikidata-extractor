I. Taylor Professor of Fluid Mechanics at the University of Cambridge. His principal research interest is the application of fluid mechanics to biology and medicine.He spent three years at Johns Hopkins University as a post-doctoral fellow. From 1968 to 1973 he was a lecturer at Imperial College London, after which he moved to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge. He remained at Cambridge until 1990 when he moved to Leeds University to be Professor of Applied Mathematics. In 1996 he returned to Cambridge and from 2000 to 2005 he was head of DAMTP.He is a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and a fellow of the Royal Society (elected 1995). Pedley was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1999) for research on biofluid dynamics, collapsible tube flow, and the theory of swimming of fish and  microorganisms. In 2008 Pedley and Professor J. D. Murray, FRS were jointly awarded the Gold Medal of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in recognition of their \"outstanding contributions to mathematics and its applications over a period of years\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Institute of Mathematics and its Applications", "response": ["* 2004 - 2005: Professor Tim Pedley FRS"]}, {"page": "Pedley", "response": ["* Tim Pedley (born 1942), British mathematician"]}, {"page": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "response": ["* 2000\u20132006: Tim Pedley (DAMTP)"]}, {"page": "G.
