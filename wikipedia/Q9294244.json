He came to prominence in the early 1990s with his direction of the music video for the Snap! song \"Rhythm is a Dancer\". Greenhalgh then was hired by the Pet Shop Boys to direct videos for their successful album Very and later its follow-up Bilingual. His work has also included the video for George Michael's song 'Jesus to a Child', several videos for Muse, Placebo, Soundgarden and others.His videos for Very make extensive and early use of computer animation and blue screen to create environments of geometric shapes and patterns in which the group members Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe are inserted. Lowe said in retrospect that he felt that computer games had a strong appeal to a young audience and that copying their design styles could be successful: \"The big game was Sonic The Hedgehog and I liked this game where the audience, when a goal was scored, all started dancing. I was playing computer games a lot, thinking, 'This is what the kids are into\u2026wouldn\u2019t it be great if we became this thing removed from reality and existing in a non-real world?'\" Spin magazine described these videos as \"routinely rejected\" by MTV, a reference to their rock-oriented programming at the time. His clip for the song \"Liberation\" was later reused in the 2000 animation anthology CyberWorld. He later directed the video of Soundgarden's song 'Black Hole Sun', attracting attention in the United States; in 1995, Spin magazine awarded him a reader's choice award for best video for this.Describing his approach to music video direction, Greenhalgh said in a 2010 interview that \"With anything, it\u2019s the lyrics that are everything. You pray that there are good lyrics in a track because that leads you immediately to what you\u2019re going to do.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sneaker Pimps", "response": ["|Howard Greenhalgh"]}, {"page": "Pet Shop Boys", "response": ["The duo's fifth studio album, Very, followed on 27 September and is the only Pet Shop Boys album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart.

The other singles from Very, \"I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing\", \"Liberation\" and \"Yesterday, When I Was Mad\", continued the theme of CGI videos, peaking with the \"Liberation\" video, which contained almost no real-life elements at all. All these videos were directed by Howard Greenhalgh, who continued to work with Pet Shop Boys well into the next decade.
