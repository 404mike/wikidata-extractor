It was  long, and  high, with seventeen arches. The viaduct took two years to build, due to the nature of the ground it was built on. Built at a cost of \u00a3244,000, over 9,000,000 bricks were used in the construction of the viaduct. Concrete blocks were used for the foundations, each one measuring  and  deep. Following the closure of the line, it was proposed in late 1968 to demolish the viaduct. Local residents were opposed to the plan, and a question was asked in Parliament by Neill Cooper-Key regarding the preservation of the viaduct, which was not listed. Kenneth Robinson answered that British Railways were prepared to transfer ownership of the viaduct to any group willing to take it, but that maintenance costs were considerable.  "]}]}}
