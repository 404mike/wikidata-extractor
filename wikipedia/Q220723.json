He also served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Brent East from 1987 to 2001. A former member of the Labour Party, he was on the party's hard left, ideologically identifying as a democratic socialist.\nBorn in Lambeth, South London, to a working-class family, Livingstone joined Labour in 1968 and was elected to represent Norwood at the GLC in 1973, Hackney North and Stoke Newington in 1977, and Paddington in 1981. That year, Labour representatives on the GLC elected him as the council's leader. Attempting to reduce London Underground fares, his plans were challenged in court and declared unlawful; more successful were his schemes to benefit women and several minority groups, despite stiff opposition. The mainstream press gave him the moniker \"Red Ken\" in reference to his socialist beliefs and heavily criticised him for supporting controversial issues like republicanism, LGBT rights, and a United Ireland. Livingstone was a vocal opponent of the Conservative Party government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which in 1986 abolished the GLC. Elected as MP for Brent East in 1987, he became closely associated with anti-racist campaigns. He attempted to stand for the position of Labour Party leader following Neil Kinnock's resignation in 1992, but failed to get enough nominations. Livingstone became a vocal critic of Tony Blair's New Labour project that pushed the party closer to the political centre and won the 1997 general election.\nAfter failing to become Labour's candidate in the 2000 London mayoral election, Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the congestion charge, Oyster card, and articulated buses, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of London Underground. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate. Re-elected in 2004, he expanded his transport policies, introduced new environmental regulations, and enacted civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012, losing both to the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. \nCharacterised by Charles Moore as \"the only truly successful left-wing British politician of modern times\", Livingstone was praised for his efforts to improve rights for women, LGBT people, and ethnic minorities in London, but also faced allegations of cronyism and antisemitism and was criticised for his connections to Islamists, Marxists, and Irish republicans. A longstanding critic of Israeli policy regarding the Palestinians, his comments about the relationship between Adolf Hitler and Zionism resulted in his suspension from the Labour Party in 2016; he resigned in 2018 before the disciplinary case could be concluded. In 2020, his comments about criticism of social media posts by Naz Shah were found by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to have constituted unlawful harassment of Jewish people which the Labour Party were legally responsible for.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antisemitism", "response": ["In 2016, the Home Affairs Select Committee held an inquiry into the rise of antisemitism in the UK.
