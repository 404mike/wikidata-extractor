Her first novel was published in 1887: Dr. Phillips: A Maida Vale Idyll.  Its portrayal of London Jews and Jewish life, and its depiction of murder by a doctor were controversial.  This was followed by more Frank Danby novels and by books on other subjects, including engraving, which were sometimes written under her own name.  Frankau continued to write until the time of her death.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
