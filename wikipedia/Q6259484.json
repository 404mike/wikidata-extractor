For about twenty years he was a merchant in South Africa, and was interested with the late Mr. Barnato in many of his most successful enterprises. He is a very rich man, but modest withal, and now that he has retired from business, he intends to devote himself to parliamentary life and the recreations of a country gentleman. He is an ardent sportsman, a good man after the hounds, a more than average shot, an expert fisherman, and no mean golf player. He has yet to make his mark as a public speaker but he has very decided opinions, and no lack of language wherewith to express them.Mainly About People, p 483, 27 May 1899, vol 50 no.2"]}, {"page": "Clive Hogger", "response": ["Hogger was educated at Sheffield University and trained for ministry at Ridley Hall, Cambridge.
