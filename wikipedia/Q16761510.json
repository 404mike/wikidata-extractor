Assheton Harbord flew regularly, often with John and Eleanor Shelley-Rolls, another keen balloonist and sister of Charles Rolls. She owned two balloons which she kept near Battersea gas works. Assheton Harbord was awarded the \"Mortimer Singer Plate\" in 1909 for the longest balloon journey in July, August or September in 1908.
