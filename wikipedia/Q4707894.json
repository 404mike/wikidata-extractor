However, the band have always felt the change in sound might have hurt their standing with the public. The song's co-writer, George Young, later reflected in Rolling Stone Australia: \"The people in the industry dig it and it skidded in and out of the Top 20.

They still made this \"more funky, and kind of crazy\" compared to traditional themes, and Marvel praised it. For Younge, it was important that the music for the series be recorded using analog technologies, comparing it to the music of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder where \"you don\u2019t like it just because it\u2019s composed well.
