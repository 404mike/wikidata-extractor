Stallybrass was a keen sportsman, although like Heberden he saw it only as a means to an end\u00a0\u2013 albeit a plethora of laudable ends.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0328. Brasenose had a middling income of \u00a324,000 a year, with a similarly average 180 undergraduates.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0338. Religious attendance was relaxed, and fees for returning to college between 9 and 11PM abolished. Brasenose's collegiate link with Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge was established. Staircases XIV and XV were created, the only significant changes to the college buildings; the twenty fellows gradually replaced in Stallybrass' own image.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0338\u2013339. Brasenose went back to the head of the river in 1928, rising from 22nd in 1922. Although Oxford's performance in rowing was poor, Brasenose was central to its few successes against Cambridge.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0343. It would sink to sixth in 1934\u00a0\u2013 although notable among its members was John Gorton, future Prime Minister of Australia.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0344. Success in rowing was matched in rugby and cricket\u00a0\u2013 with Brasenose producing players such as Alexander Obolensky and Ian Smith. Brasenose rugby only reached its peak after the Second World War, with players such as Brian Boobbyer and Philip Moore, Baron Moore of Wolvercote.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0345\u2013346. In cricket, Geoffrey Legge and Greville Stevens were early players; Ian Peebles Gerry Chalk and Roger Kimpton  followed them: between 1934 and 1938 at least five members of the university team came from Brasenose.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0346\u2013347. it may have been Brasenose's attachment to sport that meant it was slow to phase out Pass men.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0348\u2013349. The effect on academic success was considerable; Brasenose slumped in performance except in law, where it excelled. In the 1930s Brasenose recorded no more than six firsts in a year; a total assisted by seven firsts in 1937\u20131939 in law, out a total of 13 across the university.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0361. The future Lord Scarman (Lord of Appeal in Ordinary) was among undergraduates; two contemporaries and aspiring students, Richard Holdsworth and Michael Peacock were killed in the Second World War.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0375."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Geoffrey Legge (1927/28\u20131929/30) : G.
