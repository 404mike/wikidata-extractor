Women who applied to the BAS were discouraged. A letter from BAS personnel sent to a woman who applied in the 1960s read, \"Women wouldn't like it in Antarctica as there are no shops and no hairdresser.\" The first BAS woman to go to Antarctica was Janet Thomson in 1983 who described the ban on women as a \"rather improper segregation.\" Women were still effectively barred from using UK bases and logistics in 1987.
