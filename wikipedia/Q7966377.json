Small Heath v. Stoke. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 3 November 1890. They did rather better than that. In a fast-paced game, they took a two-goal lead in the first half and scored another three in the second, Stoke's only reply coming from Ted Devey's own goal. Walter Ward's debut in goal in a 1\u20131 draw at Bootle attracted praise from the Liverpool Mercury, as did his defence, and the quickness on the ball and combination play of the forwards, particularly Hallam and Will Devey, was also noted.The Alliance. Bootle v. Smallheath Alliance. Liverpool Mercury. p. 7. 10 November 1890. Small Heath arranged a friendly with Burslem Port Vale for the day allocated for the next round of the Association Cup. Heath's forwards combined well in attack and shot accurately to score five goals (with several disallowed) to Vale's one.", "After a trial in the Port Vale friendly in November, Tommy Hands made his competitive debut for Small Heath away to Stoke, playing at outside left alongside Wheldon; he was to play nearly 150 matches for the club over the next six seasons.Matthews (1995), p. 93. Short gave the visitors an early lead, and the defence held out for half an hour before conceding to a scrimmage. In the second half, Short regained the lead, but soon after Stoke equalised again, Walter Ward was injured and had to leave the field. Stoke took full advantage of their extra man and the Small Heath defence weakened by Fred Speller taking over in goal; they forced two more goals to take the match 4\u20132 and return their opponents to the bottom of the table.The Alliance.
