He married Ozawa Kane in 1863, and the couple had one son.Wirgman arrived in Japan in 1861 as a correspondent for the Illustrated London News, and resided in Yokohama from 1861 until his death. He published the first magazine in Japan, the Japan Punch, monthly between 1862 and spring 1887.  Like its  British namesake, the magazine was written in a humorous, often satirical manner, and was illustrated with Wirgman's cartoons. \nWirgman formed a partnership called \"Beato & Wirgman, Artists and Photographers\" with Felice Beato from 1864 to 1867. Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato's photographs while Beato photographed some of Wirgman's sketches and other works. \nWirgman taught western-style drawing and painting techniques to a number of Japanese artists, possibly including the ukiyo-e artist Kobayashi Kiyochika. From 1865 he had Goseda Yoshimatsu and Kan\u014d Tomonobu as his pupils. In 1866 he taught Takahashi Yuichi, sponsoring his work for the International Exposition of 1867. He also was briefly an English tutor, most notably to the future Admiral T\u014dg\u014d, then a young cadet.In the 1860s, he accompanied British envoy Sir Ernest Satow on a number of journeys around Japan as described in Satow's Diplomat in Japan.\nWirgman's grave is in the Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manga", "response": ["Kanagaki Robun and Kawanabe Ky\u014dsai created the first manga magazine in 1874: Eshinbun Nipponchi.

As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shij\u014d-d\u014dri, Kyoto);Morse, 48\u20139. although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title."]}, {"page": "Felice Beato", "response": ["While in Hong Kong, Beato met Charles Wirgman, an artist and correspondent for the Illustrated London News.

The publication reflected the social context of Bakumatsu Yokohama and often depicted the frustrations that emerged from conflicts between Japanese domestic politics and early foreign settlement life in Japan.

Though the publication debuted in 1862, it is known that a total of 64 pages were printed that year, but the number of volumes are unclear. Hence, it is determined that the magazine was first published irregularly until 1865 when it started to release issues monthly as the magazine quickly began to gain popularity amongst foreigners.  It is believed that the irregularity of the Punch was due to the state of affairs between 1862 to 1865, in which the government threatened to punish those who published content that defamed or ridiculed others, leading to a brief suspension of the publication. On the other hand, some critics such as John Clark attribute this irregularity to major events that occurred in Wirgman\u2019s personal life. Clark suggests that Wirgman got married and bought a house during this time and even travelled back to England to settle some loose financial or business ends.Clark, John.\"Charles Wirgman(1832-1891), Recent Discoveries and Re-evaluation,\" in British Library Occasional Papers II, Japanese Studies, ed. Yu-ying Brown (London: British Library, 1990), p.261-276 Wirgman also clearly hinted his leave in the Punch as he exhibited it through a few of his cartoons which showcased a crowd sending him off and an implication of his destination, London. In 1865, he resurrected the Punch by attributing his absence and marking his return to failure in \u2018searching for truth\u2019. Wirgman then maintained a regular pace of about ten to twelve issues per year till the end of the publication. He also expanded the Punch\u2019s boundaries from criticising media press and satirising local society to focusing and revealing the irrationality and issues within port treaty life, critiquing human deficiencies of greed and self-centredness and domestic politics revolving around the Japanese civil war and the Meiji Restoration.", "* Charles Wirgman"]}, {"page": "La Japonaise (painting)", "response": ["Camille's body, turned in profile, shows her face turned towards the viewer, a gesture likely inspired by gestures found in traditional Japanese dance; illustrations depicting Japanese dance, such as Charles Wirgman's A Japanese dinner party, were popular in Europe at the time, and would likely have been available for Monet to draw inspiration from."]}]}}
