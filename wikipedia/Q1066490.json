He married Ozawa Kane in 1863, and the couple had one son.Wirgman arrived in Japan in 1861 as a correspondent for the Illustrated London News, and resided in Yokohama from 1861 until his death. He published the first magazine in Japan, the Japan Punch, monthly between 1862 and spring 1887.  Like its  British namesake, the magazine was written in a humorous, often satirical manner, and was illustrated with Wirgman's cartoons. \nWirgman formed a partnership called \"Beato & Wirgman, Artists and Photographers\" with Felice Beato from 1864 to 1867. Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato's photographs while Beato photographed some of Wirgman's sketches and other works. \nWirgman taught western-style drawing and painting techniques to a number of Japanese artists, possibly including the ukiyo-e artist Kobayashi Kiyochika. From 1865 he had Goseda Yoshimatsu and Kan\u014d Tomonobu as his pupils. In 1866 he taught Takahashi Yuichi, sponsoring his work for the International Exposition of 1867. He also was briefly an English tutor, most notably to the future Admiral T\u014dg\u014d, then a young cadet.In the 1860s, he accompanied British envoy Sir Ernest Satow on a number of journeys around Japan as described in Satow's Diplomat in Japan.\nWirgman's grave is in the Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
