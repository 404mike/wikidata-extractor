He later spoke highly of the value of his experiences in the ensemble, writing in 1994 that \"I joined the orchestra in 1969 and soon found myself thrown into an energetic environment where to my surprise my musical ideas, however tentative, would be taken seriously and would actually get realised\". In 1979 he began to release very short runs of cassette singles, in line with the prevailing underground cassette culture. These were almost all released under his given name or the moniker Monoplane. It was not until 1983 that he began to use the name Organum and release his work on vinyl on various labels around Europe as well as his own imprint, Aeroplane.  Many of his releases are short; he has released several one sided 7\" singles and many EPs. In an interview with US magazine ND (issue 20, 1995), he declared \"I don't enjoy lengthy programmes. A 70 minute CD is similar to the old double album. And I never did like that\".Live performances by Jackman have been very rare and he consents to very few interviews. Despite this relative seclusion, Organum has been a platform for many collaborations with contributors including Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound, Christoph Heemann, Robert Hampson, Jim O'Rourke, Michael Prime of Morphogenesis, Eddie Pr\u00e9vost of AMM, Andrew Chalk and noise artists The New Blockaders. He also made a single, \"Breakthrough\" for The Haters without the intervention or collaboration of their principal member, GX Jupitter-Larsen; Jackman's website reports that Larsen said of the single that \"my music has never sounded better\". Pr\u00e9vost, Stapleton and Heemann all released Organum albums on their respective labels with other releases appearing on Touch Records, Robot Records and German label Die Stadt. More recently, he guested with AMM and made several collaborative releases with percussionist Z'EV, all credited jointly to Z'EV and Organum.\nHe is also known for the distinctive artwork which adorns his releases, mostly surreal colourful collages, often meticulous in their detail. However, he has also released some recordings in deliberately spartan or even non-existent artwork - one CD release came in a clear jewel case with no paper parts or other packaging. The official website archives nearly all of this artwork.\nJackman continues to create new works as well as reissuing earlier, long-unavailable titles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "AMM (group)", "response": ["Pr\u00e9vost and Tilbury continue to record and perform as AMM. They performed in London during December 2004, with Sachiko M joining as a guest, at the 2005 LMC Festival of Experimental Music, with David Jackman as a guest, and at a festival of experimental music in Belgium in February 2006. They also released a duo CD as AMM, Norwich, during 2005, and in 2009, the CD Trinity with guest John Butcher."]}, {"page": "Nurse with Wound", "response": ["Although Stapleton has sole curatorship of NWW, the group has a long list of collaborators including Diana Rogerson (Stapleton's wife), James Thirlwell of Foetus, Tony Wakeford, David Jackman of Organum, Andrew McKenzie of The Hafler Trio, Stereolab, Jim O'Rourke, Christoph Heemann, William Bennett of Whitehouse, Robert Haigh, Rose McDowall of Strawberry Switchblade, Annie Anxiety, John Balance of Coil, Matt Waldron of Irr. App (Ext), passworddoctor, and most regularly David Tibet of Current 93. For some time, NWW was a core duo of Stapleton and Colin Potter, the latter having first worked with NWW on 1992's \"Thunder Perfect Mind\" when it was recorded at Potter's ICR studio. Potter has appeared on almost every NWW release since 1992. In 2009, a CD titled \"\u00d8d Lot\" was released (credited to Nurse With Wound) which contained solo recordings by Stapleton, Potter, Waldron and Andrew Liles."]}, {"page": "List of noise musicians", "response": ["*David Jackman"]}, {"page": "Jackman", "response": ["*David Jackman, British artist", "*David Jackman (minister), English minister"]}, {"page": "Organum (band)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Jackman"]}, {"page": "The Elephant Table Album", "response": ["* David Jackman - Edge of Nothing", "Steven Stapleton of Nurse with Wound also did the artwork for the album, and was sufficiently impressed by David Jackman's track that he invited him to collaborate on a series of music projects.The Elephant Table Album", "# David Jackman - Wolf"]}, {"page": "Storm Bugs", "response": ["The first Storm Bugs release was on Snatch 1 on the Snatch Tapes cassette label.

Un an unadvertised performance was given at Maidstone Art college in 1979 and a further performance in the summer of 1980 in Brenchley Gardens Maidstone, Kent. On that occasion the band included David Jackman on esraj. In 2012 Storm Bugs performed live for the first time in 30 years at the Rammel Weekender in Nottingham alongside other acts such as the New Blockaders and the Sleaford Mods. Reviewing the Weekender in the Wire Magazine, Storm Bugs's contribution was judged by Derek Walmsley to be \"everything that's right about the weekend\".
