Mann, and Lieutenants William Stuart, Alexander Dirom and William Trench. On 11 October, Lugard expressed concern to General Thomas Ashburnham commanding the force, that the engineers' duties in the field were destroyed without a sufficient force of trained sappers. With many factors contributing to the impossibility of organising efficient substitutes, he urged that 23rd Company be shipped to Hong Kong at the earliest opportunity. Lieutenant Stuart took charge of a body of volunteer sappers, which he trained to a valuable capability. The 23rd Company carried on in India where they took part in recapturing Lucknow."]}]}}
