A right-handed batsman, in a first-class career with Surrey lasting from 1927 to 1948, he scored 19209 runs at an average of 34.61, with 34 hundreds and a highest score of 269.\nDuring World War II, he served in Coastal Command of the RAF.

Having said that, the arrival of Jim Laker certainly resolved any problems in spin bowling and his future partner Tony Lock was already making progress at second eleven level. Another good start was made by opening batsman David Fletcher who was awarded his county cap with Laker and Eric Bedser. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain Errol Holmes, Tom Barling, John Parker and Stan Squires. Laurie Fishlock had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper Arthur McIntyre played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and the retiring Alf Gover, who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer Eddie Watts could make only a few appearances due to injury. Geoffrey Whittaker made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays Bernie Constable and Stuart Surridge also played.Playfair, pp. 92\u201394."]}, {"page": "Albert Alderman", "response": ["Alderman kept his first-team place throughout the golden years of the early to mid-1930s when, despite placing tenth in the 1932 County Championship table, fresh blood in the team was to give them their first, and as yet, only County Championship capture in 1936. During these years, Alderman was able to keep his batting average ticking over and around the 25 mark, and, having played more times during the 1936 season than any other to date, cemented his place in the Derbyshire opening attack, most notably with Test cricketer Stan Worthington and sometime wicket-keeper Harry Storer alongside him. Alderman was also noted for his deep fielding. At The Oval in 1936, Surrey batsman Tom Barling swept a ball from Bill Copson to leg which looked as if it was carrying for six. Alderman sprinted 30 yards round the fine-leg boundary to catch it with his outstretched right hand just above the palings. Wisden pronounced that \"the catch should live in the memories of all those who were present on the Wednesday\"."]}, {"page": "East of England cricket team", "response": ["* Tom Barling (1948)"]}, {"page": "Barling (surname)", "response": ["*Tom Barling (1906\u20131993), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Surrey had a strong team in the 1920s but then fell away, after Jack Hobbs retired, to be a mid-table one through most of the 1930s.
