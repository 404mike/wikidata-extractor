He began his career as a composer writing theatre music but later devoted himself to working as an organist and composer for the Church of England. He is considered one of the outstanding 18th century English composers of church music and is best remembered today for his seven-part anthem Call to Remembrance, which has long survived in the repertoires of cathedral choirs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Arne", "response": ["During the 1750s and 1760s, Arne worked as an organist and harpsichordist and composer to the theatres and pleasure gardens of London. He married in the 1750s to a now unknown woman who died only a few years into their marriage. From 1756 onwards he composed a considerable amount of music for the stage, much in the same vein as his father. He wrote several successful operas, a significant amount of incidental music for plays, and published several song collections. Several of his songs were written for performance in London's pleasure gardens. One of his best-known songs is  Lass with the Delicate Air, which premiered in 1762. In 1764 he collaborated with Jonathan Battishill in setting Richard Rolt\u2019s Almena, which was a theatrical flop but praised for its fine music. The previous year he had met soprano Elizabeth Wright after hearing her perform at Ranelagh Gardens. The two became romantically involved and married in 1766. The following year Elizabeth sang the title role in his opera Cymon. The work used a libretto by David Garrick and was the greatest success of his career. Arne's wife sang in several more of his stage works as well as other productions in leading roles at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane throughout the 1760s."]}, {"page": "1801 in music", "response": ["*December 10 \u2013 Jonathan Battishill, composer of church music, 63  "]}, {"page": "St Clement's, Eastcheap", "response": ["*Jonathan Battishill (born 1738, appt. 1765, died 1801)"]}, {"page": "1738 in music", "response": ["*May \u2013 Jonathan Battishill, composer (died 1801)"]}, {"page": "List of Anglican church composers", "response": ["*Jonathan Battishill"]}, {"page": "Glee (music)", "response": ["* Jonathan Battishill"]}, {"page": "Charles King (composer)", "response": ["Some of his choristers included English composers Jonathan Battishill, William Boyce and organist Dr. Maurice Greene."]}, {"page": "St Paul's Cathedral School", "response": ["* Jonathan Battishill, composer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Busby (composer)", "response": ["His father was musical, and sang himself; when his son developed a fine treble voice, he decided to bring him up as a musician.
