They started with engine building then expanded into shipbuilding in 1851. They produced over forty steamers including the Russia, one of the top ships crossing the Atlantic. They then moved to Govan and later to a new works at Clydebank, increasing staff from 1,500 to over 4,000 at the new works. After James' early retirement and the sudden death of George, the new works were managed by the sons of George (also called James & George).\nIn 1899, Sheffield steel manufacturer John Brown & Co. took over the Clydebank shipyard founded by James and George Thomson.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Destroyer", "response": ["Fernando Villaamil, second officer of the Ministry of the Navy of Spain, designed his own torpedo gunboat to combat the threat from the torpedo boat.
