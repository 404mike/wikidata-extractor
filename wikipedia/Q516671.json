Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind. The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against a long series of problems, some of which he creates for himself. Set in an unnamed town in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford in Christchurch, Dorset.One Foot in the Grave Series 6 DVD Commentary Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.", "Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) \u2013 Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.I Don't Believe It! The 'One Foot in the Grave' Story, BBC documentary, 2000 From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after an automatic security system made him redundant at the office where he worked as a security guard, but to no avail. He believes everything is going wrong for him all the time and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor does not see himself as retired and is always trying to find another job, but most of his attempts end in failure. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite fa\u00e7ade collapses when events get the better of him and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. \"Victor-isms\" include \"I do not believe it!\", \"I don't believe it!\", \"Un-be-lievable!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?\", \"In the name of sanity!\". Despite his grumpy demeanour Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin \"Hearts of Darkness\" he liberates elderly nursing-home residents who were being mistreated by staff, and in \"Descent into The Maelstrom\" he calls the incident-room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 42 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says \"You were always my first choice\", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode \"The Wisdom of the Witch\" in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, out of the window of the house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.", "The One Foot in the Grave theme song was written, composed and sung by Eric Idle.

The brothers drove around in a comical bubble car, a precursor to the famous Trotters' van; and there was even the joke where, just as he was trying to impress the girl (Cheryl Hall), Jason casually leaned back against the bar, without his knowing that barman had just lifted it behind his back, and fell through.
