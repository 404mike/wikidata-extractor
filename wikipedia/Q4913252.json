He went on to play 14 more times in the league, scoring once, forming a regular partnership with Overson in the heart of the defense. However, injury forced him to miss the remainder of the campaign as the team suffered relegation to the Third Division for the first time in their history."]}, {"page": "Wayne Harrison (footballer, born 1957)", "response": ["Following his retirement from playing, Harrison worked towards his coaching badges and completed his UEFA \"A\" licence in 1996. He spent time as a youth team coach at Carlisle before returning to Workington for a third spell with the club, and a second stint as manager, in January 1995. He guided the team to a 16th-placed finish in his first full season in charge in 1995\u201396 but left the club midway through the following campaign. Harrison was then assistant manager to Gordon Raynor at Lancaster City for a time in 1997 before resuming his managerial career when he was appointed as manager at Bamber Bridge later the same year. He steered the team clear of relegation during his sole season in charge, leading to a move to Accrington Stanley following the dismissal of Billy Rodaway in December 1998. Harrison tendered his resignation at Accrington Stanley to take up a full-time post as the Director of Coaching for Youth at Blackpool F.C."]}]}}
