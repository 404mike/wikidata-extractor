The pair of small wooden beads, one on each end of a leather thong (string), is worn around the neck as part of the Scout uniform. The beads are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a tartan patch of the Maclaren clan, honoring William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the \u00a37000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional \u00a33000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate. The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle (neckerchief slide) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians."]}, {"page": "Gilwell Park", "response": ["In the late Middle Ages the area was a farm, growing to a wealthy estate that fell into disrepair towards 1900. It was bought in 1919 by Scout Commissioner William de Bois Maclaren and given to The Scout Association of the United Kingdom to provide camping to London Scouts, and training for Scouters. As Scout Leaders from all countries of the world have come to Gilwell Park for their Wood Badge training, it is one of the landmarks of the world Scouting movement.", "The estate's condition declined more during the 1910s. William de Bois Maclaren was a publisher and Scout Commissioner from Rosneath, Dumbartonshire, Scotland. During a business trip to London, Maclaren was saddened to see that Scouts in the East End had no suitable outdoor area to conduct their activities. He contacted Lord Robert Baden-Powell, who appointed P.B. Nevill to handle the matter. Nevill was Scout Commissioner of the East End."]}, {"page": "Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America", "response": ["During the Wood Badge course Scouters, both staff and participants, wear the uniform of their unit and membership division; this is a change from the older custom where the uniform was worn without insignia other than the council shoulder patch and the Troop 1 numeral. The uniform is worn with the Wood Badge training hat, the neckerchief and with a woggle made during the opening sessions of the course. The hat and neckerchief use the Troop 1 numeral to represent the first troop to use the Wood Badge program. The axe-in-log is the emblem of Gilwell Park where the first Wood Badge course was held and the Maclaren tartan honors William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the funding to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919. After completing Wood Badge, the beads, neckerchief and woggle are presented and worn."]}, {"page": "Rosneath", "response": ["*William de Bois Maclaren, publisher, businessman and Scout Commissioner, purchased Gilwell Park in Essex and donated it to The Scout Association in 1919."]}, {"page": "Silver Wolf Award (The Scout Association)", "response": ["* William de Bois Maclaren"]}, {"page": "MacLaren (surname)", "response": ["*William de Bois Maclaren (1856\u20131921), Scottish publisher, businessman and Scout Commissioner"]}, {"page": "William de Bois MacLaren", "response": ["#REDIRECT William de Bois Maclaren "]}, {"page": "P. B. Nevill", "response": ["In 1916, Nevill became The Boy Scouts Association Commissioner for East London. He moved into Roland House Scout Settlement in East London as its warden. Roland House was the legacy of Roland Philipps who was killed in action in the 1914-18 World War. Roland House and its Scout Shop were maintained by its wardens, Rovers and resident Scout leaders. William de Bois Maclaren was a guest of Nevill's at Roland House, which was decisive in De Boise Maclaren's donation of Gilwell Park to The Boy Scouts Association. In 1920, Nevill took over the full lease for Roland House and all financial responsibility. Upon his marriage in 1926, he moved out of Roland House to Reigate, Surrey. Nevill remained on the Roland House Committee until the 1960s. Roland House was closed by The Scout Association soon after Nevill's death."]}]}}
