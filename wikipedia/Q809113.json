He is Music Director of the Royal Ballet Covent Garden having also held this position from 1990 to 1995. He began his second tenure in that post in 2007. Since 1989, he is Music Director and the principal conductor of the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO). In March 2007 at Brighton, Wordsworth caused controversy when he refused to conduct Andrew Gant's new composition A British Symphony the day of the scheduled premiere. He was music director of Birmingham Royal Ballet from 2005 to 2008.\nWordsworth's discography includes works by lesser-known British composers alongside more mainstream pieces. In his career Wordsworth has appeared with many of the world\u2019s leading orchestras in the UK and overseas. He has made many appearances at the BBC Proms and conducted the Last Night of the Proms in 1993 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In 2003, he was the first conductor to record commercially all nine surviving movements of Constant Lambert's ballet Horoscope (only a suite of five movements had previously been recorded).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Belmont, Sutton", "response": ["* Barry Wordsworth (born in Cheam 1948), orchestral conductor \u2013 music director."]}, {"page": "Royal Liverpool Philharmonic", "response": ["In 1957 the society and orchestra were granted \"Royal\" status and were authorised to include this word in their title.
