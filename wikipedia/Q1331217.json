The society was noted for wanting conversation and did not encourage card playing. They invited various people to attend including Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Catharine Macaulay, Elizabeth Griffith, Hannah More, Elizabeth Ann Linley, Charlotte Lennox and Stillingfleet. One story tells that Stillingfleet was not rich enough to have the proper formal dress, which included black silk stockings, so he attended in everyday blue worsted stockings. James Boswell records that during a period of poor conversation when Stillingfleet was absent that it was remarked that they were \"nowhere without blue stockings\". The term came to refer to the informal quality of the gatherings and the emphasis on conversation over fashion.Barbara Brandon Schnorrenberg, \"Montagu, Elizabeth (1718\u20131800),\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.
