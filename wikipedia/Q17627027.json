Many of his photographs were used to produce picture postcards of the seaside towns and attractions in the South of England.  Many of these postcards are still circulating at postcard fairs and acquired by collectors. They are usually identifiable by the initials \"MJR\" followed by a serial number. Several thousand of his original glass-plate negatives still exist and are being academically catalogued. A large sub-section of these negatives, featuring scenes in Wales, is held by the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.\nAlthough based in Bournemouth, Ridley's photographs span from Oxford in the north and Cornwall in the south-west to the Isle of Wight in the south.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Super Bowl LII halftime show", "response": ["During the performance, Timberlake wore an outfit designed by Stella McCartney, which consists of \"alter nappa fringed jacket with a shirt, featuring a landscape artwork by British artist Martin Ridley,\" according to a press release. Also part of the look is a Prince of Wales-check and camouflage splatter-print suit and matching jacket. As usual for McCartney, these pieces were made from animal-free leather and organic cotton."]}]}}
