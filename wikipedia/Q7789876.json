Rose himself, however, had a fairly successful game with the ball, claiming 3-68 in Kent's first innings; his victims were Bill Ashdown, Edward Solb\u00e9 and Tich Freeman.His next game, against Warwickshire at Amblecote, saw him take four wickets in the match,\nbut in the three other games he played at first-class level Rose contributed absolutely nothing: he took no wickets and held no catches, while with the bat he made just 11 in four innings.", "link_mentions": {}}}
