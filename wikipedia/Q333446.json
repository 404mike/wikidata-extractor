At the 1997 general election, Moore succeeded Steel as the Liberal Democrat MP for the Scottish Borders constituency of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Berwickshire, Roxburgh & Selkirk from 2005). He joined the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team in 2005, and held many portfolios, including Defence, Foreign Affairs, International Development and Northern Ireland & Scotland (joint).\nFollowing the 2010 general election, and the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, the cabinet post of Scottish Secretary was given to the Liberal Democrats, initially Danny Alexander. However following the resignation of Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws a month later, Alexander took his role, and Moore was appointed the Scottish Secretary on 29 May 2010. After entering office, Moore oversaw the implementation of the Scotland Act 2012, which granted further devolution to Scotland. He was removed from the post in a Cabinet reshuffle in October 2013.\nMoore was elected on two occasions (2005 and 2010) to serve as Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, and was returned on two earlier occasions (1997 and 2001) as MP for the previous constituency of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. He was defeated in the 2015 general election by Calum Kerr, the SNP candidate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Secretary of State for Scotland", "response": ["| The Right HonourableMichael MooreMP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk(born 1965)"]}, {"page": "Michael Kevin Moore", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Moore (Scottish politician)"]}, {"page": "Alistair Carmichael", "response": ["In October 2013, he was promoted by Nick Clegg to the position of Secretary of State for Scotland in the UK Cabinet, replacing Michael Moore."]}, {"page": "Michael Moore (disambiguation)", "response": ["Michael Moore is an American filmmaker and author.", "Michael Moore may also refer to:", "* Michael Moore (herbalist) (1941\u20132009), author, founder of the SW School of Botanical Medicine and expert on medicinal plants", "* Michael Moore (physicist) (born 1943), professor of theoretical physics since 1976 at the University of Manchester", "* Michael Moore (bassist) (born 1945), American bassist", "* Michael Moore (saxophonist and clarinetist) (born 1954), American musician", "* Michael Moore (Australian politician) (born 1950), former member of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly", "* Michael Moore (Scottish politician) (born 1965), Liberal Democrat politician in the UK, former Secretary of State for Scotland", "* Michael Moore (judge) (fl. 1990s\u20132000s), former Federal Court of Australia justice", "* Michael Moore (offensive lineman) (born 1976), former American football guard", "* Michael Moore (footballer) (born 1981), Scottish football player", "* Michael Moore (rowing) (born 1970), American Olympic rower", "* Michael Moore (Swedish officer) (born 1953), major-general in Swedish Air Force, and expert at Swedish Department of Defense"]}]}}
