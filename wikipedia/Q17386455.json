His most famous contribution was a 1974 paper co-authored with Clive Granger which introduced the concept of spurious regressions.Newbold earned his B.Sc. from London School of Economics and his Ph.D. under supervision of George E. P. Box at University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. He later was a professor most notably at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign and the University of Nottingham. He also taught courses on time series analysis while on sabbatical at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business (now the University of Chicago Booth School of Business). He has written a very popular and thorough statistics textbook: \"Statistics for Business and Economics\" along with W L Carlson and B Thorne, now in its 8th edition. He also co-authored with Clive Granger the influential textbook: \"Forecasting Economic Time Series\" (2nd ed; Academic Press, 1986).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clive Granger", "response": ["After reading a pre-print copy of the time series book by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins in 1968, Granger became interested in forecasting. For the next few years he worked on this subject with his post-doctoral student, Paul Newbold; and they wrote a book which became a standard reference in time series forecasting (published in 1977). Using simulations, Granger and Newbold also wrote the famous 1974 paper on spurious regression which led to a re-evaluation of previous empirical work in economics and to the econometric methodology."]}, {"page": "Cointegration", "response": ["Before the 1980s, many economists used linear regressions on non-stationary time series data, which Nobel laureate Clive Granger and Paul Newbold showed to be a dangerous approach that could produce spurious correlation, since standard detrending techniques can result in data that are still non-stationary. Granger's 1987 paper with Robert Engle formalized the cointegrating vector approach, and coined the term."]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Paul Newbold, 71, econometrist."]}, {"page": "Newbold, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Newbold"]}]}}
