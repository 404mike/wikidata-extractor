Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year, giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music, seen as cutting edge in its film-noir feel and stylish, yet emotional appropriations of past sounds, was also widely imitated, causing the band to recoil from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize."]}, {"page": "1965", "response": ["** Beth Gibbons, English singer, lead singer of the band Portishead"]}, {"page": "Portishead (band)", "response": ["Portishead is an English band formed in 1991 in Bristol.

Adrian Utley then met Barrow while they were recording Coach House Studios, heard their first recorded track \"It Could Be Sweet\", and started exchanging ideas on music. Barrow taught Utley sampling while Utley introduced to the band unusual sounds such as cimbaloms and theremins which led to an \"amalgamation of ideas\".

NME summed up the record by writing: \"This is, without question, a sublime debut album. But so very, very sad.\" It observed, \"From one angle, its languid slowbeat blues clearly occupy similar terrain to soulmates Massive Attack and all of Bristol hip-hop's extended family. But from another these are avant garde ambient moonscapes of a ferociously experimental nature.\" The review concluded that \"Portishead's post-ambient, timelessly organic blues are probably too left-field, introspective and downright Bristolian to grab short-term glory as some kind of Next Big Thing. But remember what radical departures Blue Lines, Ambient Works and Debut were for their times and make sure you hear this unmissable album.\" Melody Maker stated that the band \"were undeniably the classiest, coolest thing to have appeared in the country for years\u00a0... Dummy, their debut, takes perfectly understated blues, funk and rap/hip hop, brackets all this in urban angst and then chills it to the bone.\" The review described the record as \"musique noire for a movie not yet made, a perfect, creamy mix of ice-cool and infra-heat that is desperate, desolate and driven by a huge emotional hunger, but also warmly confiding\u00a0... Most of us waver hopelessly between emotional timidity and temerity the whole of our lives and Dummy marks out that territory perfectly.\" Tim Marsh of Select wrote: \"Jumbling up hip hop, blues, jazz, dub and John Barry-esque TV theme tunes with the edgy lyrics and valium vocals of Beth Gibbons, it's lounge music for arty schizos.\"", "Q described Dummy as \"perhaps the year's most stunning debut album\" and proclaimed that \"the singer's frail, wounded-sparrow vocals and Barrow's mastery of jazz-sensitive soul/hip hop grooves and the almost forgotten art of scratching are an enthralling combination\". Mojo said that \"Portishead make music for an early evening drinks party on the set of The Third Man. There is nothing kitschy about them either\u00a0... Beth Gibbons' voice has a genuine chill to it, and Geoff Barrow's background soundscapes are worthy of Lalo Schiffrin and Nellee Hooper.\" Rolling Stone wrote: \"From tape loops and live strings, Fender Rhodes riffing and angelic singing, these English subversives construct tr\u00e8s hip Gothic hip-hop\u00a0... Assertive rhythms and quirky production, however, save Portishead from languishing in any cosy retro groove. Instead they manage yet another\u00a0\u2013 very smart\u00a0\u2013 rebirth of cool.'", "Retrospective reviews of the album have praised it highly. AllMusic wrote: \"Portishead's album debut is a brilliant, surprisingly natural synthesis of claustrophobic spy soundtracks, dark breakbeats inspired by frontman Geoff Barrow's love of hip-hop, and a vocalist (Beth Gibbons) in the classic confessional singer/songwriter mold\u00a0... Better than any album before it, Dummy merged the pinpoint-precise productions of the dance world with pop hallmarks like great songwriting and excellent vocal performances.\" A BBC Music review in 2015 called it \"quite simply one of the greatest debut albums of the 1990s\" and said that \"the constituents that make up much of this collection are easily traced\u00a0\u2013 back to dub, to soul, and especially to hip hop; the array of scratch effects, loops and samples\u00a0... But it's the manner in which the pieces come together that makes Dummy special to this day\u00a0... Imitators have come and gone, but no act has reproduced the disquieting magnificence conjured here except Portishead themselves.\" Writing for Pitchfork in 2017, Philip Sherburne summarised that \"Portishead's 1994 debut is a masterwork of downbeat and desperation.
