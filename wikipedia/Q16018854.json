Over the course of his literary career he wrote four novels, Jonah and His Mother (1964), A Secondary Character (1965), The Devil is a Single Man (1969) and The Edgware Road (1970), exploring different aspects of Jewish life, and a biography of Sir David Webster, The Quiet Showman (1975), along with several short stories and radio and TV plays.  He won the Henfield Foundation Award for his first two novels and gained a BAFTA nomination for his TV play Can You Hear Me Thinking?.\nAs a character model, he worked for the Ugly Models agency, and appeared in advertisements for Schweppes, Weetabix, Right Guard and Sony, amongst others. He was employed as new fiction reviewer by The Sunday Times and also contributed numerous reviews to many other leading British publications.\nFrom the 1980s onwards he presented, and sometimes wrote, several radio and TV programmes for the BBC on a variety of subjects, including literature, opera and music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Georg Solti", "response": ["The biographer Montague Haltrecht suggests that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext to abandon the Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden.Haltrecht, p. 258 However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed.Solti, pp. 124\u2013125 He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged that he had had a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously."]}, {"page": "Frederick Ashton", "response": ["After the end of the war David Webster invited de Valois to move her company from Sadler's Wells to be resident at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden alongside the new opera company he was establishing.Haltrecht, pp. 59\u201360. Ashton's first ballet for the company in its new home was Symphonic Variations (1946). The historian Montague Haltrecht writes of it, \"It is a masterpiece created for the Opera House and for the company's dancers, and almost of itself defines a style of English dancing.\"Haltrecht, p. 73 Although the Covent Garden stage was much larger than that at Sadler's Wells, Ashton confined himself to six dancers, led by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes. The work, which remains in the repertoire as at 2013, was a success from the outset.\"New Ballet at Covent Garden\", The Times, 25 April 1946, p. 6."]}, {"page": "The Royal Opera", "response": ["From the mid-19th century, opera had been presented on the site of Covent Garden's Royal Opera House, at first by Michael Costa's Royal Italian Opera company.\"History\" , Royal Opera House.

Pre-war opera was described by the historian Montague Haltrecht as \"international, dressy and exclusive\".Haltrecht, p.18 During the war, the Royal Opera House was leased by its owners, Covent Garden Properties Ltd, to Mecca Ballrooms who used it profitably as a dance hall.Haltrecht, p. 51 Towards the end of the war, the owners approached the music publishers Boosey and Hawkes to see if they were interested in taking a lease of the building and staging opera (and ballet) once more. Boosey and Hawkes took a lease, and granted a sub-lease at generous terms to a not-for-profit charitable trust established to run the operation.Haltrecht, pp. 52 and 58 The chairman of the trust was Lord Keynes."]}, {"page": "Joan Carlyle", "response": ["Other roles, which she performed throughout many seasons included Oscar in Un ballo in maschera, a performance which Montague Haltrecht, in his biography of the first ROH general administrator David Webster, describes as \"the young Joan Carlyle makes a pageboy with a delicious vocal glitter\";Haltrecht, p. 229 Ascanius in Les Troyens; and Mimi in Peter Brook's staging of La boh\u00e8me which resulted in a BBC Television production of the opera.

He also directed Thom Delaney's one man show The Importance of Being Irish (1978) at the Roundhouse Downstairs in Chalk Farm, London.  This collection of modern Irish poetry interspersed with songs and anecdotes later transferred to the Young Vic in London and then to a tour of Soweto and other black townships in South Africa in 1979.  Amer also directed The Sea Pearls black theatre company in The Unfaithful Woman by Sam Mangwane. In 1984, he directed the South African actress Bess Finney in Ellen Terry \u2013 The Harum Scarum Girl,  written originally for Judi Dench by Montague Haltrecht, at both the Isle of Man Festival and the Edinburgh Festival.", "Travelling the world as a Shakespearean actor and a bachelor for two years was a welcome distraction from the problems of settling down. Marriage and family life had never been an option as Amer believed that it would kill his dream of devoting his life to Shakespeare. In 1965, after his second overseas tour, Amer went to the Old Vic to see the Berliner Ensemble perform The Little Mahagonny. It was there at the after-show party that he met up again with Montague Haltrecht, the man who would become his life partner, a Jewish prize-winning novelist and a BAFTA nominee. They had first met each other briefly eight years earlier while Amer was appearing in Love for Love at the Theatre Royal, Windsor in 1957. They decided to live together, and in September 2003, following the setting up of the London Partnerships Register by Ken Livingstone two years earlier, Britain's first register for same-sex couples, they decided to join. Six years later, after the law governing same-sex couples changed as a result of the government's passing of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, they decided to take advantage of the new law. Montague Haltrecht died of cancer in March 2010, at home in Amer's arms."]}, {"page": "List of Wadham College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Montague Haltrecht, writer and literary critic"]}]}}
