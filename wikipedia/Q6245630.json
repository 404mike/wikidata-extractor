In 2010, he became involved in investigating a \"cash for influence\" scandal. Despite working on such high-profile cases, Lyon himself maintained a low profile, something which attracted adverse comment.In 2012, Lyon stood for election to the Council of the National Trust but was not elected.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen Byers", "response": ["In March 2010, Byers was among the politicians caught out by undercover journalists who were posing as lobbyists from an international company. The journalists were from The Sunday Times and filming for a Channel Four investigatory series called Dispatches. He was shown describing himself as a \"cab for hire\" and offering to lobby his parliamentary contacts in support of the fictitious company for a financial payment of between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000 per day. Byers claimed to have influenced outcomes for National Express and Tesco through his relationships with Lord Adonis, Transport Secretary, and Lord Mandelson, Business Secretary, respectively. He claimed that he phoned Mandelson to put a stop to \"massively bureaucratic\" food labelling regulations after he had been contacted by Tesco. He later withdrew his name for consideration by the fictitious lobbying company via email, claiming he had over-stated his role, writing, \"I have not spoken to Andrew Adonis or Peter Mandelson about the matters I mentioned\". When the story broke, National Express and Tesco also denied there was any truth in Byers' statements. Byers referred himself to John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.  Byers expressed confidence that Lyon would clear his name, but he was eventually banned from the parliamentary estate. On 22 March 2010, Byers' administrative suspension from the membership of the Parliamentary Labour Party was announced alongside those of Patricia Hewitt, Geoff Hoon and Margaret Moran. However, all four remained members of the Labour Party itself."]}, {"page": "Yvette Cooper", "response": ["In May 2009, the Daily Telegraph reported that Cooper had changed the designation of her second home twice in two years. Following a referral to the parliamentary standards watchdog, Cooper and her husband Ed Balls were exonerated by John Lyon, the Standards Commissioner. He said they had paid capital gains tax on their homes and were not motivated by profit. Cooper and Balls bought a four-bedroom house in Stoke Newington, North London, and registered this as their second home (rather than their home in Castleford, West Yorkshire); this qualified them for up to \u00a344,000 a year to subsidise a reported \u00a3438,000 mortgage under the Commons Additional Costs Allowance, of which they claimed \u00a324,400. An investigation in MPs' expenses by Sir Thomas Legg found that Cooper and her husband had both received overpayments of \u00a31,363 in relation to their mortgage. He ordered them to repay the money."]}, {"page": "Derek Conway", "response": ["The ruling did not involve the elder son, Henry Conway, as he was not the subject of the original complaint, but John Lyon, who had recently taken on the post of Parliamentary commissioner for standards, received complaints about similar payments to Henry while he was also a student and doing the \"job\" which Freddie took over.

In 2009, he claimed \u00a3125 for a course on \"intimate relationships\" on his Parliamentary office costs allowance, but this was rejected. The Daily Telegraph also noted he was claiming up to \u00a37000 a quarter for a mortgage on a \u00a32m house near Parliament.  In early 2010, during the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, it emerged that Tredinnick had chosen to return \u00a3755.33 as he had decided that his expenditure on astrology software was supplementary to his parliamentary duties, although the parliamentary commissioner for standards John Lyon had decided against requesting that he should do so."]}, {"page": "Elliot Morley", "response": ["Morley told BBC News that he had repaid the money two weeks before The Telegraph story breaking upon realising he had mistakenly continued claiming for his mortgage payments after the mortgage had been paid off in 2006. On 14 May 2009 he was suspended from holding office in the Parliamentary Labour Party because of this scandal. Morley referred himself to John Lyon, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, in an effort to clear his name. It was reported that this inquiry was put on hold pending a police investigation.

He concluded that, although her London home was a genuine home and she had spent more nights there than in her Redditch home, her constituency home was in fact her main home, and that she was in breach of Commons rules, despite \"significant mitigating circumstances\". The claims for pay-per-view films were also found to be in breach. Ms Smith was not asked to repay any money, but was told to \"apologise to the House by means of a personal statement.\" Smith reacted by saying that she was \"disappointed that this process has not led to a fairer set of conclusions, based on objective and consistent application of the rules as they were at the time.\""]}, {"page": "Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn", "response": ["On 24 February 2008, John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, was asked by the Taxpayers' Alliance to investigate whether Martin had abused parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lyon was obliged to examine all such complaints although the Commissioner could have ruled that the complaint was unfounded.

Granatt blamed unnamed officials, but not the Speaker, for falsely informing him that the expenses were legitimate because Martin's wife had been accompanied by an official on shopping trips to buy food for receptions. In fact, her housekeeper had accompanied her; catering for such receptions is the responsibility of the parliamentary caterers."]}, {"page": "Maria Miller", "response": ["In December 2012, The Daily Telegraph reported that, between 2005 and 2009, Miller had claimed over \u00a390,000 in parliamentary expenses for the mortgage and upkeep of a house in south London where her parents lived.
