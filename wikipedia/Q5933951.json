In 1806, George visited Temple Newsam and presented Isabella with Chinese wallpaper, which she hung in the small Drawing Room next to the Great Hall in around 1820, embellished with cut out birds from Audobon's The Birds of America (now worth \u00a37.5 million). Lady Hertford inherited the house in 1807; after her husband died in 1822 she spent the season in London, and the rest of the time at Temple Newsam where she involved herself in charitable works including distributing food and clothing to the local people. She allowed the servants to hold an annual supper and ball at Temple Newsam. During the last years of her life, the canal, railway and roads encroached on the estate as well as coal mining; and she dealt with the companies setting these up. In 1820 the novelist Sir Walter Scott published Ivanhoe featuring a Templar preceptory named Temple Stowe, believed to have been modelled on Temple Newsam; the name is preserved in local road names such as Templestowe Crescent. At her death in 1834, Isabella left Temple Newsam to her widowed sister, Frances Ingram Shepheard, wife of Lord William Gordon, who died in 1841.thumb|right|Temple Newsam House from Morris's Country Seats (1880)In 1841 the estate was inherited by Hugo Charles Meynell Ingram (d. 1869), son of Elizabeth Ingram, sister of Frances Ingram (Lady Gordon), who made no alterations to the estate. In 1868, the Prince of Wales stayed at Temple Newsam during his visit to Leeds to open the Fine Art Exhibition in the New Infirmary; temporary triumphal arches were erected on the estate. Following Hugo Charles's death, his son Hugo Meynell-Ingram (d.1871) inherited Temple Newsam; two years later, at his death, his wife Emily Meynell Ingram (d.1904) inherited the estate. Emily spent a large part of her widowhood at Temple Newsam; she developed it considerably by replacing the sash windows and remodelling the dining room, great staircase and Lord Darnley's room. Emily bequeathed Temple Newsam to her nephew Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax."]}, {"page": "West Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Hugo Meynell-Ingram"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Hugo Meynell-Ingram; MP for West Staffordshire (1868\u20131871)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Hugo Meynell-Ingram"]}, {"page": "Hugo Francis Meynell Ingram", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugo Meynell-Ingram"]}, {"page": "Emily Meynell-Ingram", "response": ["In 1864 she married  Hugo Meynell-Ingram, who was the last surviving descendant of Sir Arthur Ingram.
