In the fall of 1923, he signed with the Brooklyn Wanderers of the American Soccer League. He played only one league game, scoring a goal, that season. Over the next two seasons, he became a regular on the Brooklyn front line, scoring twelve goals during the 1923\u201324 season. This put him ninth on the league scoring list.
