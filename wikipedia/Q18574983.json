There was much opposition from foreign residents in China to the amalgamation of the positions.  The opposition was not based on Hannen's ability but rather that it was inappropriate for one man to hold a judicial and executive position at the same time.North China Herald, 13 March 1891 p305 The position of Chief Justice and Consul General were separated in 1897 and Hannen continued as Chief Justice.Hansard, 10 August 1898, Appropriation Bill Debate George Jamieson who had been Assistant Judge and Consul was appointed Consul-General.

Against the background of growing fear of commercial competition from Russia, France and Japan, certain members of the General Committee and Shanghai Committee felt that the association's influence with the Foreign Office was exaggerated, and that the Government was failing to effectively represent British mercantile interests in China. It was felt that public pressure was needed to push the Government into action.  Sir Edward Ackroyd suggested that the association change its strategy and reorganise into a 'League'. This proposal was voted down. The insurgents formed the China League, with R.A.
