It is generally believed he was mistaken for the prominent club cricketer and BBC captain, Major Leo Bennett, who was mooted as a likely choice. Leo Bennett later played for Northamptonshire.\nNigel Bennett had played three matches for Surrey Second Eleven in 1936, twice against Kent Second Eleven and once against Wiltshire. He played in 31 first-class matches for Surrey as a right-handed batsman, scoring 688 runs at an average of 16.00 with a highest score of 79. He scored four half-centuries and took six catches. Bennett was \"a weak batsman and utterly lost as a county captain\", and Surrey slumped to 11th, their worst ever finish. He was replaced by Errol Holmes, who was recalled as captain for the 1947 and 1948 seasons.\nBennett was born at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey and died in Bristol.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Surrey cricket captains", "response": ["| 24 ||align=\"left\" | Nigel Harvie Bennett ||  || 1946"]}, {"page": "Bennett (name)", "response": ["*Nigel Harvie Bennett (born 1912), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Leo Bennett", "response": ["Bennett was a right-handed middle-order batsman who played for Surrey's second eleven in 1937, and might have played more for Surrey but for a mistake at the start of the 1946 season. According to a published history of the county club, Surrey, casting around for an amateur captain to lead the side in the hastily arranged first season of first-class cricket after the war, alighted on the name \"Major Bennett\". The intention appears to have been to offer the job to Leo Bennett, but instead, another club cricketer, Major Nigel Harvie Bennett, who had also played a few second eleven matches pre-war, was asked and he accepted the job."]}, {"page": "Nigel Bennett (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECTNigel Harvie Bennett"]}]}}
