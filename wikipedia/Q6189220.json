Lacey caused the second fall to go against the team as Jetta checked on her after she was knocked off the apron, leaving Rain to be double teamed and pinned. Lacey was fundamental in the third pin as she handed Jetta a chain to use, giving her the second and decisive fall for her team. However, as the team celebrated with their newly found gold, a backstage official came to the ring and demanded the match be restarted owing to the underhanded tactics of the team and Ashley Lane and Neveah instantly pulled out their double team move and won.

Enraged, Black chased Jetta out of the building but the two were booked for a grudge match later on that same night; Giving Jetta a taste of her own medicine, Black attacked her from behind during her entrance leading to a brawl all around ringside that consumed most of the match until it officially began inside the ring with Black eventually losing as Jetta used the ropes for the pin. After Black was on the winning side of the tag team match at Shimmer, it became clear the two needed to settle their feud one-on-one and RQW decided to host the match in October.

Jetta made her intentions known by squashing Faith LeHaine early on in the evening, wrenching her shoulder with a Japanese stranglehold and spent most of the match against Black working on her shoulder but Black retaliated, applying the Garden of Eden around the ring post and eventually locking it on Jetta in the middle of the ring forcing her to tap out.

Nikita earned a rematch while Wesna was ill and it took place at Night in Motion XII: Sold Out ended in a draw as a result of double knockout. Despite this draw, Blue Nikita was overlooked as Breakthrough Champion Steve Douglas had set on a mission to become the GSW Triple Crown Champion and unite all the belts. In a Winner Takes All Championship match, Wesna was defeated in the main event of Night in Motion XIII: Lucky 13 and lost her belt. Her attempt to regain it was in a Four Way match, also including Awesome Kong, which was thwarted by her nemesis Blue Nikita who walked away with the title. In February 2009 Wesna managed to best Blue Nikita, but only by count out (for which titles do not change hands) and Wesna could not recreate a victory in their Spartan Death Match two months later, acquiescing to her first defeat in GSW singles competition after eight chair shots.", "Wesna's feud with Blue Nikita spilled over into ACW during an interpromotional event with the European Wrestling Council (EWC) in 2003. Wesna once again secured victory over her Greek enemy In November she teamed up with the EWC Commissioner in a mixed tag match, defeating her nemesis again who teamed with Matthias Treu. The two met again at Wild Christmas 2007 for Wesna's Real Quality Wrestling (RQW) Women's Championship where once again she was successful leading to Wesna's final ACW match at Riptide II in February 2008 with another successful RQW title match against Jetta.", "ChickFight XI was originally slated to be a two out of three falls match to find a decisive victory until Melissa pulled out due to injury. After Melissa's injury, Wesna was rebooked in a tag team match alongside former rival Jetta where the two beat Mancunian twins Team Blossom. Later in the evening Wesna brought her longstanding rivalry with Blue Nikita to England with a ChickFight Rules match where the two brawled around the venue for twenty minutes with Nikita eventually picking up the victory. The day before she appeared in a ChickFight attraction match in Rotherham, South Yorkshire for Shooting Star Wrestling also defeating Blue Nikita.", "In June 2007 she made her first appearance for London based promotion Real Quality Wrestling. In nearby Essex she wrestled a Four-Way Elimination match for the RQW Women's Championship against holder Eden Black, Jetta and Amazing Kong, managing to best them all to win the belt. She returned to defend the belt at RQW's annual No Pain, No Gain event in January 2008 against Jetta with Sweet Saraya as the referee. It came to an abrupt end when Jetta walked out, resulting in a count out, due to a legitimate injury that caused her to collapse afterwards, leading to their aforementioned match in ACW's Riptide II where Wesna won again. In July of that year, in Vienna, she put up the RQW Championship, along with her WSA Women's European Championship against the World Association of Women's Wrestling (WAWW) British Champion Sweet Saraya in a triple crown match. Despite the torrential rain, the two insisted on wrestling with Saraya eventually winning all three championships. Following the match, an infuriated Wesna attacked the referee with a Samoan drop and consequently had her wrestling license suspended for three months."]}, {"page": "Rachel Summerlyn", "response": ["On October 19, 2008, at the tapings of Volume 21, Summerlyn debuted on SPARKLE, the preshow of Shimmer Women Athletes, where she defeated Sassy Stephie to win a part in the main roster.
