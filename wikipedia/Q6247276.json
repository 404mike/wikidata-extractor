He also travelled to Italy and Spain during this period, where he discovered the work of Chagall and the Symbolists.\nThese experiences influenced his work for the remainder of his career. Maxwell was a lifelong friend of William Gillies with whom he frequently travelled on painting trips. Along with Gillies, he was one of the group of artists who became known as The Edinburgh School. Maxwell taught intermittently at Edinburgh College of Art from 1928 to 1933, 1935 to 1946, and 1955 to 1961. He first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1935 and became a full member in 1949.", "link_mentions": {}}}
