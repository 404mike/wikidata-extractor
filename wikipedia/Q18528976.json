The school was staffed by women volunteers and the girls were taught to read and to spin and in return the student's were paid wages for their work and clothed. Cappe wrote that the purpose was to \"excite a spirit of virtuous industry among the children of the poor\". The parents were keen because they were clothed as the students were taught how to create garments from the yarn they had spun. Given this education they were able to apply for better paid work and avoid the options usually open to poor uneducated girls.", "She and Gray were enthusiastic in reforming education at the Grey Coat School in York, where from 1786 the Ladies's Committee she headed took over management, and wrote about assisting other charity schools. She and Faith Gray founded the York Female Friendly Society and she married in 1788, becoming Catharine Cappe. She was widowed in 1800. She also tried to establish visitors to her local hospital. She had no ambition to vote but she felt that middle class women had a duty to inspect female sections of charities."]}]}}
