The unions  gave strong support to British participation in the Cold War and NATO, as well as international bodies such as the international Confederation of Free Trade Unions that excluded communist unions of the sort that joined the Soviet-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions. In some unions, especially the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the Communists did have some power, as typified by Mick McGahey, vice-president from 1972 to 1987, and Arthur Scargill, the president from 1982 to 2002. More effective in the Communist cause was Ken Gill, president of a large  union and in 1974 the first Communist elected in decades to  the TUC General Council.  He focused on racial issues.Robert Taylor , The TUC: From the General Strike to New Unionism (2000) p. 231  British unions collaborated with the AFL\u2013CIO in the United States on international projects. In the 1980s, worldwide union attention focused on the Solidarity union movement in Poland, which finally succeeded in breaking the communist control of that country. Norman Willis, the general secretary of the TUC, vigorously promoted union support for Solidarity.  The nuclear disarmament movement, which played a major role in Labour Party internal politics in the 1980s, was primarily a middle-class movement that had little support in the labour movement.Ben Pimlott and Chris Cook, eds., Trade Unions in British Politics: The First 250 Years (1991) pp 201-3, 290-92."]}, {"page": "Roy Jackson (trade unionist)", "response": ["Born in Paddington in London, Jackson was educated at North Paddington Central School.
