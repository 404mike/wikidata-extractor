This gave him a key role in arresting wartime spies, and he was closely involved in the prosecution of Mata Hari, Sir Roger Casement and many Irish and Indian nationalists. His equating of Jews with Bolshevism led to accusations of anti-semitism. Thomson was also a successful novelist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mata Hari", "response": ["In November 1916, she was traveling by steamer from Spain when her ship called at the British port of Falmouth. There she was arrested and taken to London where she was interrogated at length by Sir Basil Thomson, assistant commissioner at New Scotland Yard in charge of counter-espionage. He gave an account of this in his 1922 book Queer People, saying that she eventually admitted to working for the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau. Initially detained in Cannon Street police station, she was then released and stayed at the Savoy Hotel. A full transcript of the interview is in Britain's National Archives and was broadcast, with Mata Hari played by Eleanor Bron, on the independent station LBC in 1980. It is unclear if she lied on this occasion, believing the story made her sound more intriguing, or if French authorities were using her in such a way but would not acknowledge her due to the embarrassment and international backlash it could cause."]}, {"page": "Ian Fleming", "response": ["On 29 September 1939, soon after the start of the war, Godfrey circulated a memorandum that, \"bore all the hallmarks of\u00a0... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming\", according to historian Ben Macintyre. It was called the Trout Memo and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The memo contained several schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to Operation Mincemeat, the 1943 plan to conceal the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa, which was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: \"A Suggestion (not a very nice one)\", and continued: \"The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it would have to be a fresh one.\""]}, {"page": "MI5", "response": ["In the meantime, MI5's role had been substantially enlarged.  Due to the spy hysteria, MI5 had been formed with far more resources than it actually needed to track down German spies.  As is common within governmental bureaucracies, this caused the service to expand its role, to use its spare resources.  MI5 acquired many additional responsibilities during the war.  Most significantly, its strict counter-espionage role blurred considerably.  It became a much more political role, involving the surveillance not merely of foreign agents, but also of pacifist and anti-conscription organisations, and of organised labour.  This was justified through the common belief that foreign influence was at the root of these organisations.  Thus, by the end of the First World War, MI5 was a fully-fledged investigating force (although it never had powers of arrest), in addition to being a counter-espionage agency.  The expansion of this role continued after a brief post-war power struggle with the head of the Special Branch, Sir Basil Thomson.", "After the First World War, Kell's department was considered unnecessary by budget-conscious politicians.  In 1919, MI5's budget was slashed from \u00a3100,000 and over 800 officers to just \u00a335,000 and 12 officers.  At the same time, Sir Basil Thomson of Special Branch was appointed Director of Home Intelligence, in supreme command of all domestic counter-insurgency and counter-intelligence investigations.  Consequently, as official MI5 historian Christopher Andrew has noted in his official history Defence of the Realm (2010), MI5 had no clearly defined role in the Anglo-Irish War.  To further worsen the situation, several of Kell's officers defected to Thomson's new Agency, the Home Intelligence Directorate.  MI5 therefore undertook no tangible intelligence operations of consequence during the Irish War of Independence.  MI5 did undertake the training of British Army Case Officers from the Department of Military Intelligence (DMI), for the Army's so-called 'Silent Section', otherwise known as M04(x).  Quickly trained by MI5 veterans at Hounslow Barracks, outside London, these freshly minted M04(x) Army case officers were deployed to Dublin beginning in the Spring of 1919.  Over time, 175 officers were trained and dispatched to Ireland.  In Ireland, they came under the command of General Cecil Romer and his Deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Searle Hill-Dillon.", "In April 1919, Colonel Walter Wilson of the Department of Military Intelligence arrived in Dublin to take over the day-to-day management of these 175 Army intelligence officers, and the unit was designated as the 'Dublin District Special Branch' (DMI/MO4(x)/DDSB), because it operated exclusively within the confines of the Army's Dublin Military District.  Royal Marine Colonel Hugh Montgomery of the Department of Naval Intelligence, was also seconded to Romer's intelligence staff at this time.  British Army after-action reports and contemporary accounts indicate that M04(x)/DDSB was considered a highly amateurish outfit.  Serious cover constraints, coupled with alcohol abuse and social fraternisation with local prostitutes would prove to be the downfall of several of these amateur sleuths.  Despite these failings, it was not MI5, but one of Basil Thomson's agents, John Charles Byrnes, a double agent within the IRA, who identified Michael Collins, and came close to arranging his capture.  Byrnes was discovered as a British spy and executed by the IRA in March 1920.", "The intelligence staff of Michael Collins Irish Republican Army penetrated the unit.  Using DMP detectives Ned Broy and David Nelligan, Michael Collins was able to learn the names and lodgings of the M04(x) agents, referred to by IRA operatives as 'The Cairo Gang'.  On Bloody Sunday, Collins ordered his counter-intelligence unit, The Squad, to assassinate 25 M04(x) agents, several British Courts Martial Officers, at least one agent reporting to Basil Thomson, and several intelligence officers attached to the Royal Irish Constabulary Auxiliary Division, at their lodgings throughout Dublin.  Although the shooting of 14 British officers had the desired effect on British morale, in many ways Bloody Sunday was a botched job.  Three of Collins's men were apprehended after engaging in a shoot-out on the street, and at least two of the wounded British officers had no connection whatsoever to British intelligence.  Moreover, with MO4(x) having fielded a total of 175 agents of the DDSB, Collins's operation only temporarily slowed British momentum.  Within days, the remaining 160-odd M04(x) agents were re-established in secure quarters inside solidly loyalist hotels in Dublin, from where they continued to pursue Collins and the IRA relentlessly right up until the truce.  In December 1920, the entire DDSB was transferred from British Army command to civil command under Deputy Police Commissioner General Ormonde Winter, and thereafter was known as 'D Branch' within Dublin Castle.  By January 1921, the highly experienced MI6 operative David Boyle arrived at Dublin Castle to take over the day-to-day management of D Branch.  The unit's former commander, Colonel Wilson, resigned in protest for having had his command taken from him.  D Branch thrived under Boyle's leadership.  The net impact of Collins's strike of Bloody Sunday, 21 November 1920, was therefore quite negligible, even though the IRA had not gone up against MI5 professionals, but instead only a quickly trained outfit of amateur army 'D-Listers'.  ", "In 1921, Sir Warren Fisher, the government inspector general for civil service affairs, conducted a thorough review of the operations and expenditures of Basil Thomson's Home Intelligence Directorate.  He issued a scathing report, accusing Thomson of wasting both money and resources, and conducting redundant as well as ineffectual operations.  Shortly thereafter, in a private meeting with Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Sir Basil Thomson was sacked, and the Home Intelligence Directorate was formally abolished.  With Thomson out of the way, Special Branch was returned to the command of the Commissioner of The Criminal Investigation Division at Scotland Yard.  Only then was Vernon Kell able once again to rebuild MI5, and regain its former place as Britain's chief domestic spy agency."]}, {"page": "Mansfield Smith-Cumming", "response": ["At the outbreak of war he was able to work with Vernon Kell and Sir Basil Thomson of the Special Branch to arrest twenty-two German spies in England. Eleven were executed, as was Sir Roger Casement, found guilty of treason in 1916. During the war, the offices were renamed. The Home Section became MI5 or Security Service, while Cumming's Foreign Section became MI6 or the Secret Intelligence Service. Agents who worked for MI6 during the war included Augustus Agar, Paul Dukes, John Buchan, Compton Mackenzie and W. Somerset Maugham.Popplewell 1995, p. 230.", "The Government Committee on Intelligence decided to slash Kell's budget and staff and to subordinate MI5 under a new Home Office Civil Intelligence Directorate led by Special Branch's Sir Basil Thomson in January 1919. The powerful partnership of MI5 and Special Branch had managed counterintelligence and subversives during the war, but that was suddenly thrown into disarray. These bureaucratic intrigues happened at the very moment when the Irish abstentionist party Sinn F\u00e9in and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) were launching their own independence campaign.Cottrell, p. 28.", "Cumming and SIS (then MI1(c)) organized a new espionage unit in Ireland in mid-1920 called the Dublin District Special Branch. It consisted of some 20 line officers drawn from the regular army and trained by Cumming's department in London. Cumming also began importing some of his own veteran case officers into Ireland from Egypt, Palestine, and India, while Basil Thomson organized a special unit consisting of 60 Irish street agents managed by communications from Scotland Yard in London.McMahon, p.39"]}, {"page": "Counterintelligence", "response": ["Due to its success, the Government Committee on Intelligence, with support from Richard Haldane and Winston Churchill, established the Secret Service Bureau in 1909 as a joint initiative of the Admiralty, the War Office and the Foreign Office to control secret intelligence operations in the UK and overseas, particularly concentrating on the activities of the Imperial German government. Its first director was Captain Sir George Mansfield Smith-Cumming alias \"C\". The Secret Service Bureau was split into a foreign and counter-intelligence domestic service in 1910. The latter, headed by Sir Vernon Kell, originally aimed at calming public fears of large-scale German espionage.Christopher Andrew, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of Mi5 (London, 2009), p.21. As the Service was not authorized with police powers, Kell liaised extensively with the Special Branch of Scotland Yard (headed by Basil Thomson), and succeeded in disrupting the work of Indian revolutionaries collaborating with the Germans during the war. Instead of a system whereby rival departments and military services would work on their own priorities with little to no consultation or cooperation with each other, the newly established Secret Intelligence Service was interdepartmental, and submitted its intelligence reports to all relevant government departments."]}, {"page": "Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet", "response": ["Wilson privately suspected Lloyd George of being \"a traitor & a Bolshevist\" (15 January 1920 \u2013 he expressed similar concerns on 27 May and 23 July \u2013 Calwell omitted most of these entries from his published version of Wilson's diaries). He was particularly concerned by the presence in May of a Soviet trade delegation led by Krasin, who on his second visit in August 1920 was accompanied by Kamenev, who was keen to make contacts in the UK and who was subsidising the Daily Herald.On 18 August Wilson confided his doubts in his deputy, Harington and in Lt-Gen Sir William Thwaites, Director of Military Intelligence, and later that day he saw Churchill, who wrote to the Prime Minister recommending the expulsion of the Soviet emissaries.
