He transferred to Huddersfield Town for a \u00a3350,000 fee in March 1997, but never lived up to his price tag at the Galpharm Stadium. He enjoyed short loan spells at Preston North End and Port Vale, before joining Hull City on a free transfer in June 2001. He switched to Plymouth Argyle in July 2002. Loaned out to Macclesfield Town in October 2003, he was allowed to join Tranmere Rovers the following month.

This was initially until the end of the season, but Horton was given the job on a permanent basis in May. He rejuvenated a demoralised side and kept them in the Football League, as they finished seven points clear of the relegation zone in 2003\u201304. Over the summer he signed Iraqi international Jassim Swadi, experienced striker Mike Sheron, veteran defender Tony Barras, left-back Mark Bailey, and Tommy Rooney. He allowed Martin Carruthers to leave, though extended Tommy Widdrington's contract, and offered fresh deals to six others. He later added to his squad by signing Mark Boyd and Simon Weaver; whilst transfer listing Tommy Widdrington and Michael Welch. Many pundits were tipping the \"Silkmen\" to slip out of the newly named League Two at the end of the 2004\u201305 season, but Horton proved the observers wrong as his side were in the top-seven of the division virtually all season long. Horton celebrated his 1000th game as a manager on 3 November 2004, as Macclesfield beat Mansfield 4\u20130 in the Football League Trophy. He also won the League Two Manager of the Month award for February. Macclesfield qualified for the play-offs in sixth place, but their promotion challenge was finally ended by Lincoln City in the semi-finals, following a 2\u20131 aggregate defeat. At the end of the season, Horton released nine players, including club captain Matthew Tipton. In the place of these nine players he signed Kevin Sandwith, Kevin Townson, Martin Bullock, and David Beresford."]}, {"page": "Andy Morrison", "response": ["Morrison was signed by Brian Horton for Huddersfield Town in the 1996\u201397 season. Horton used the \u00a32.7 million that Sheffield Wednesday had used to purchase Andy Booth from Huddersfield, to invest in Morrison as well as Marcus Stewart from Bristol Rovers and Andy Payton from Barnsley. Horton, like Allardyce before him, also made Morrison captain. Morrison scored in his debut for Huddersfield against Charlton (which Huddersfield won 2\u20130). Morrison's Huddersfield teammate Ben Thornley described him as 'the hardest person to have ever played football'. Morrison won the respect of fans 'with his braveheart style warrior performances'. A knee injury restricted Morrison's appearances for Huddersfield in the 1996\u201397 season. He was replaced by Sam Collins in a 1\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in September 1996 and did not play for Huddersfield again until a 0\u20130 draw with Manchester City in November 1996, in which he was replaced by Kevin Gray just after half time. He did not play again until April 1997 when he replaced David Beresford, at half time, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Charlton Athletic. In the 1997\u201398 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 3\u20130 defeat to West Ham United in the League Cup, in which John Hartson scored a hat trick. He also played in Huddersfield's 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon, in the FA Cup, in which Neal Ardley scored the only goal. Huddersfield's poor results in the league that season (they went nine games without a win) led to Horton being sacked. Horton was replaced by Peter Jackson, who managed to keep the team up. Morrison played in Huddersfield's first victory that season, a 3\u20131 win against Stoke City (in which Lee Richardson, Stewart and Paul Dalton scored Huddersfield's goals). He also played in Huddersfield's second win of the season, a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester City at Maine Road, in which Rob Edwards scored the winner. In the 1998\u201399 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 2\u20131 defeat to Everton, in the League Cup, in which Olivier Dacourt and Marco Materazzi scored Everton's goals and Stewart scored Huddersfield's goal. Morrison fell out with Jackson early that season when the latter decided to make Barry Horne Huddersfield captain, leading to Morrison's departure."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|19||David Beresford||||MF||0 (2)||0||0||0||1||0||1 (2)||0"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|19||David Beresford||||MF||0||0||0||0||0 (1)||0||0 (1)||0"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|David Beresford||||MF||13 (6)||2||1 (1)||0||0 (2)||0||14 (9)||2"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|David Beresford||||MF||5 (3)||0||0||0||1||0||6 (3)||0"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|David Beresford||||MF||6||1||0||0||0||0||6||1"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|David Beresford||||1997\u20132001||24 (11)||3||1 (1)||0||2 (3)||0||0||0||0||0||27 (15)||3"]}, {"page": "David Beresford (journalist)", "response": ["In 1994, Beresford wrote in The Guardian that Justice Richard Goldstone ran a \"much vaunted\" judicial commission of inquiry that \"failed dismally\", and that was a \"rubbish bin\" used by the South African government.
