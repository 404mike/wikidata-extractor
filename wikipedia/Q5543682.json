Yet Strafford was capable of inspiring strong friendships in private life: at least three men who served him in Ireland, Christopher Wandesford, George Radcliffe and Guildford Slingsby, remained his loyal friends to the end. Wentworth's last letter to Slingsby before his execution shows an emotional warmth with which he is not often credited.Wedgwood p.384 Sir Thomas Roe speaks of him as \"Severe abroad and in business, and sweet in private conversation; retired in his friendships but very firm; a terrible judge and a strong enemy\". He was a good husband and a devoted father. His appearance is described by Sir Philip Warwick: \"In his person he was of a tall stature, but stooped much in the neck. His countenance was cloudy whilst he moved or sat thinking, but when he spoke, either seriously or facetiously, he had a lightsome and a very pleasant air; and indeed whatever he then did he performed very gracefully\". He himself jested on his own \"bent and ill-favoured brow\", Lord Exeter replying that had he been \"cursed with a meek brow and an arch of white hair upon it, he would never have governed Ireland nor Yorkshire\". Despite his terrifying manner, there is no real  evidence that he was physically violent: even the most serious charge against him, that he ill-treated Robert Esmonde, causing his death, rests on disputed testimony."]}, {"page": "George Radcliffe", "response": ["George Radcliffe may refer to:", "* Sir George Radcliffe (politician) (1593\u20131657), English politician", "* George Radcliffe (footballer), English footballer", "* George Radcliffe (cricketer) (1877\u20131951), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Christopher Wandesford", "response": ["Wandesford's value to Wentworth was fully recognised by the latter, who wrote that of all the Privy Council he confided only in Wandesford and George Radcliffe, for whose services he could never be sufficiently thankful.
