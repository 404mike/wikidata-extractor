It was intended to be a darker entry in the Mega Man X series. Mega Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western-designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X's new design. It was intended to be the first of a trilogy of games, where players controlled its protagonist X in the first two games and then as Zero for the third. The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier Mega Man X titles.", "Maverick Hunter was in development by Armature Studio and was to be published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series. The collaboration was established by Keiji Inafune, who had previously worked on the Mega Man series as an artist and producer. He had since rose in the ranks at Capcom to become a producer. The goal was to attract a new audience to the Mega Man series. Its development would have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd. The redesign for the Mega Man character was to be done by Adi Granov (the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name). An initial concept design showed X with a red glowing 'X' on his face.", "Joystiq's JC Fletcher noted that while Mega Man X didn't need a \"gritty\" reboot, it is a better alternative than to have no Mega Man games. Tony Ponce compared the redesign of X to that of Bomberman in Bomberman: Act Zero. He also stated that it was a Mega Man X game \"in the very loosest sense.\" He felt that the cancellation was for the best and that a \"cold, gritty first-person shooter\" was not the ideal direction for the series. He compared it to Metroid Primes design by noting that the art style did not change much while X's redesign was \"virtually unrecognizable.\" He later commented that an early concept design by Adi Granov was \"not that bad\" if it had no relation to the Mega Man X series. Chris Carter felt that while he didn't think the series needed a \"gritty reboot\", he would have enjoyed it if it was good. Clint Mize wrote an article for MTV.com's gaming section detailing why Maverick Hunter was a terrible idea. He felt that it could have turned off \"core fans\" of the Mega Man X series and that X required a \"solid core title to reintroduce the character\" rather than a \"dark reimagining\". He added that the decision to make it a first-person shooter made it feel like it was the product of an \"out of touch executive\". He also criticized it due to the risk involved in competing with big FPS games such as Call of Duty, Halo, and Battlefield. He noted that the perspective introduces other problems, such as reduced emphasis on platform segments. Its art design and gameplay have been compared to the video game Vanquish."]}, {"page": "Fan Expo Canada", "response": ["| Neal Adams, Olunik\u00e9 Adeliyi, Gillian Anderson, Kevin J.

Stan Winston, a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on Zathura, built metal and rubber versions of the armor. The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single  version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times. Stan Winston Studios built a ,  animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\" (Obadiah Stane), a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking. A scale model was used for the shots of it being built. The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps. Iron Man comic book artist Adi Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders. Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page. Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions, and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"", "In July 2006, with the film still in pre-production, Favreau and Arad attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film, where the film's armor design, drawn by Adi Granov, was revealed along with the announcement that the Mandarin was intended to be the antagonist of the film. The following year, Favreau returned to San Diego Comic-Con to once again promote the film with Downey and Feige, where a teaser trailer was shown. With much of the visuals not yet ready, Favreau worked with ILM to have the flying shots ready, saying \"I knew that I had to make a splash because there was zero anticipation for the film at the time\"."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Hickman", "response": ["*** Dark Reign: The Cabal: \"...and I'll Get the Land\" (with Adi Granov, anthology one-shot, 2009)"]}, {"page": "Lille Comics Festival", "response": ["| December 8\u20139, 2006 || Sugar Hall (Hall aux Sucres)|| 200 || Mike Carey, D'Israeli, Jamie Delano, Glenn Fabry, Adi Granov, \u00c9ric H\u00e9renguel, Jock (comics), Kevin Crossley, Dave Kendall, Roger Landridge, Dom Reardon, Paul Renaud, Liam Sharp, Emily Hare, Emma Simcock Tooth, Bryan Talbot, Chris Weston ||Also called Festival de la bande dessin\u00e9e Anglo-saxonne", "| November 1\u20132, 2008 || Sugar Hall (Hall aux Sucres) || 1400 || Charlie Adlard, Phil Winslade, Simon Bisley, Doug Braithwaite, Andy Brown, Philippe Cardona, Glenn Fabry, Sylvain Guinebaud, Niko Henrichon, Barry Kitson, Frazer Irving, Adi Granov, Cyril Pontet, Paul Renaud, Fran\u00e7ois Duprat, Vanyda||Seth Fisher Award : Simon Bisley"]}, {"page": "2009 in comics", "response": ["* April 4\u20135: Emerald City ComiCon (Washington State Convention & Trade Center, Seattle, Washington, USA) \u2014 13,000 attendees; guests: Humberto Ramos, Barry Kitson, Darwyn Cooke, Mark Brooks, Joe Casey, Christos Gage, Jimmy Palmiotti, Amanda Conner, Frank Cho, Stuart Immonen, Adam Hughes, Steve Niles, Joseph Michael Linsner, Adi Granov, Mark Waid, Matt Fraction, Stan Sakai, Tony Harris, Brian Michael Bendis, Becky Cloonan, Vasilis Losos, James Kochalka, David Peterson, Paul Smith, Patrick Gleason, Mark Texeira, Brian Denham, Joe Jusko, Stephen Silver, Rick Remender, Gene Ha, Mike Huddleson, and Tim Sale"]}, {"page": "C.
