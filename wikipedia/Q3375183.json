Campell Cory. Playing under the Cheltenham College rules, Glamorgan FC had increased its membership to sixty six by November 1874.Davies (1975), pg 11 1874 saw Glamorgan's first away game, against Cowbridge Grammar School, and by 1875 the team played its first encounter with Newport.The 1874\u201375 Season historyofnewport.co.uk Around 1875, two further clubs came into existence in Cardiff, they were Tredegarville Football Club, whose ranks included Jas. Bush, father of future Cardiff rugby hero Percy Bush; and the Wanderers Football Club whose captain and founder was William David Phillips. Of the three teams, Glamorgan and Wanderers became the most notable, but both teams rarely travelled, and both had difficulty beating the now established clubs of Newport and Swansea.Davies (1975), pg 12 The supporters of both clubs started an agitation in the summer of 1876 for the two clubs to amalgamate, to give Cardiff town a better chance of beating the neighbouring teams. On Friday 22 September 1876 members of the Glamorgan and Wanderers clubs met at the Swiss Hall in Queen Street, Cardiff and decided to make a single club, to be called Cardiff Football Club. The first team captain was Donaldson Selby of Glamorgan and the vice-captain W.D. Phillips of Wanderers. Initially the club strip was black with a white skull and crossbones,Davies (1975), pg 13 but after pressure from the players parents to change what they saw as an inappropriate strip, the team adopted the black and blue of Cambridge University; after club player Thomas William Rees of Caius College brought his university strip to the club.", "In 1898, Cardiff were unofficial club champions of Wales for the first time. One year later, centre Gwyn Nicholls became the first Cardiff player to play for the British and Irish Lions (then only representing the British Isles), and scored a try in both the first and second Tests against Australia. Nicholls would also go on to captain Wales between 1902 and 1906. In 1904, Cardiff players fly-half Percy Bush, centre Rhys Gabe (who later captained Wales in 1907) and Arthur 'Boxer' Harding all went on the Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand (Nicholls was not selected). Bush scored in the first and second test against Australia, as Nicholls had, and thanks to his tries and goal-kicking during the first three Tests, finished as the top Test points scorer. Gabe scored a try in the third test against Australia, while Harding converted a try in the first Test and was the only Lions player to get on the score sheet against New Zealand, after scoring a penalty goal in the game against them at the end of the tour.", "*  Percy Bush 1904"]}, {"page": "Rhys Gabe", "response": ["His most remarkable try was probably one scored against England at Bristol in 1908. The match was played in thick fog, and Gabe and his teammate Percy Bush found a loose ball outside England's 25.

Continuing their impressive form, South Africa beat a Monmouthshire team and then Roos lead his team in a victory over Llanelli.Billot (1974), pg 57. The final game, before leaving for France, was against Cardiff, captained by Percy Bush. Several of the Cardiff players had represented Wales when the teams had met earlier in the tour, and amongst the Cardiff squad was Gwyn Nicholls, who had received much of the blame for the Welsh defeat. The conditions at the Cardiff Arms Park were worse than the England game, and after Roos lost the toss,Parry-Jones (1999), pg 194. the Welsh took advantage of the weather, using the wind to keep the ball behind the South Africans and choosing to dribble rather than handle the ball. The tour appeared to have caught up with the Springboks, who appeared slow, allowing Cardiff to score four tries without reply. For only the second time on the tour, the South Africans had been beaten, this time by a convincing 17\u20130 scoreline. At the after-match dinner at the Queen's Hotel in Cardiff, Roos stood to make a speech, \"It is only human to be disappointed in having been beaten... but I am glad for one man's sake that you had such a glorious success, and that is our friend Gwyn Nicholls.\"Billot (1974), pg 66."]}, {"page": "1955 in Wales", "response": ["*19 May \u2013 Percy Bush, Wales international rugby union player, 75"]}, {"page": "The Original All Blacks", "response": ["The next game was against Cardiff on 26 December.
