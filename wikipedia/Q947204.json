After losing his place at Celtic to Artur Boruc, Marshall moved to Norwich City (initially on loan) in 2007. He moved to Cardiff City in 2009, and helped them win promotion to the Premier League in 2013. Marshall stayed with Cardiff until 2016, when he was transferred to Hull City for \u00a35 million. After three seasons with Hull he signed for Wigan Athletic.\nMarshall made his full international debut for Scotland in 2004. He has since won over 40 caps, despite having had to compete with Craig Gordon and Allan McGregor for the goalkeeping position in the national team for much of his career. Marshall played a key role in Scotland's qualification for UEFA Euro 2020, as he made decisive saves in penalty shootouts against Israel and Serbia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 5", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 David Marshall, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Riddrie", "response": ["Scottish international footballer David Marshall grew up in Riddrie."]}, {"page": "Kevin Phillips (footballer)", "response": ["On 10 July 2011, Phillips signed a one-year deal with Football League Championship club Blackpool.

He again scored twice a few days later, including a last-minute equaliser, in a 2\u20132 draw away at Brighton & Hove Albion. On 5 November, Phillips scored the only goal of the game against Millwall within three minutes of coming on as a substitute. In a five-game spell in January and February 2012, he came off the bench to score late equalising goals in three league matches, two of which Blackpool went on to win, and, in his first start for three months, converted a 93rd-minute penalty against Sheffield Wednesday in the fourth round of the FA Cup to force a replay. Phillips finished the season as the club's top scorer, with 17 goals in all competitions, and won their goal of the season for his equaliser against Cardiff City, described in The Observer as \"a lovely lob punishing [goalkeeper] David Marshall for a punched clearance that lacked the required distance.

He suffered an ankle injury just before the final, but he overcame the injury to start at Wembley Stadium. Heaton followed his penalty heroics against Crystal Palace when he started the penalty shoot-out by pushing Steven Gerrard's effort onto the bar, but he ultimately ended up on the losing team as Liverpool won the shoot-out 3\u20132.

In the following game against Bolton Wanderers on 15 August 2007, Warner dropped the ball after collecting it from a Nicky Hunt throw-in and gave former teammate Hei\u00f0ar Helguson a goal for Bolton, but somewhat redeemed himself after pulling off a full-stretch save from Nicolas Anelka and Fulham won 2\u20131. On 18 August against Middlesbrough, Warner gifted debutant Mido a goal, after Warner mistimed a shot from the Egyptian and the ball bounced off his chest and rolled into the back of the net, as in the Bolton game, he somewhat redeemed himself after pulling off a full-stretch save from central defender David Wheater. Warner's mistake this time affected the score, with Middlesbrough winning 2\u20131. With Niemi still injured and Warner regularly making mistakes, Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez, brought in Kasey Keller on 23 August 2007, to provide cover and competition for Warner and Niemi.

On 22 October 2011 against Watford at the KC Stadium, an error in the Watford box left the ball loose for Fryatt to fire home from close range. On 1 November 2011 against Barnsley at the Oakwell Stadium, Dele Adebola chested the ball down nicely into the path of Fryatt and the striker fired home into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. On 19 November 2011 against Derby County at Pride Park, Liam Rosenior advanced from right back all the way to the edge of the Derby box before feeding Matty Fryatt. He had beaten the offside trap and finished confidently past Frank Fielding. On 26 November 2011 against Burnley at the KC Stadium, Cameron Stewart received the ball tight to the left touchline, beat Kieran Trippier for skill and pace before crossing low for Matty Fryatt to finish from close range at the near post. A break-away started by Paul McKenna, passed through Robert Koren and fed to Fryatt resulted in the striker blasting home his second goal of the game, although Grant in the Burnley goal will surely have been disappointed with his attempts to keep the shot out. On 3 December 2011 against Leicester City at the KC Stadium, Cameron Stewart's persistence allowed him to poke a ball through to Aaron Mclean and although he should have got his shot away sooner, it didn't matter as he was brought down by Leicester captain Matt Mills. The referee pointed to the spot and the defender was promptly sent off. Fryatt stepped up to take the penalty and confidently beat Kasper Schmeichel.
