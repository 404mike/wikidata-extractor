In the FA Cup, Liverpool were defeated by local rivals Everton in the semi-finals. Prior to the match, as captain, Raisbeck had met with the club's directors and pushed for the inclusion of Sam Raybould in the starting line-up which was agreed after it was confirmed that he had sufficiently recovered from injury. However, some players later met with the directors and convinced them to drop Raybould and gave the directors the impression that Raisbeck was in agreement with this decision. The directors relented and the team was rearranged without Raisbeck's knowledge. He would later comment on the changes which left several players out of position for the match, stating \" our forwards were all out of tune and they did little that was right. We lost, but I still feel it was an error of judgement which deprived Liverpool of competing in the final.\""]}, {"page": "Gordon Hodgson", "response": ["During his Anfield career Hodgson missed very few games in league or cup and scored prolifically throughout; therefore, it was a shame that his career coincided with a barren period for the club because his contribution to the Liverpool cause was massive. The 36 league goals Hodgson scored during the 1930\u201331 season beat Sam Raybould's total of 31 scored in 1902\u201303 and set a new club record that would last for more than thirty years, until it was beaten by Roger Hunt in 1961\u201362.  Hodgson scored three hat-tricks that season at Anfield but perhaps it was the four goals he scored in an away match at Hillsborough that gave him the most satisfaction of all.  He was top scorer in seven out of the nine full seasons he played for Liverpool.  On completion of his ten years service he was honoured by the club with a benefit sum of \u00a3650. His popularity prompted an ingenious biscuit seller to name the home-made ginger nuts, that he sold in a quantity of five for a penny on matchdays at Anfield, in his honour: \"Hodgson's Choice! Hodgson's Choice!\" he would call.  The 1935\u201336 season proved to be Hodgson's last at Anfield; his 9 goals in 17 league appearances was yet again a decent return, but on 8 January 1936 he was allowed to move to Aston Villa  for \u00a34,000.     In total Hodgson scored 241 goals in 377 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions, earning him a place in the Liverpool FC Hall of Fame and leaving him third in the all-time list of leading goalscorers for the Anfield club with only Ian Rush (346) and Roger Hunt (285) having scored more."]}, {"page": "Merseyside derby", "response": ["|Sam Raybould"]}]}}
