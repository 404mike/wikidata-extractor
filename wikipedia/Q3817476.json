Moore, John Cook Wilson and H. A. Prichard. The contemporary influences shaped their views about general philosophical questions on the basis of careful attention to the more specific judgements we make. They took our specific judgements to be more secure than more general judgements.

The problem was also discussed by others with whom Carroll corresponded, and was addressed in later articles published by John Venn, Alfred Sidgwick and Bertrand Russell among others. Cook Wilson's view is represented in the story by the character of Uncle Joe, who attempts to prove that Carr must always remain in the shop. Others had taken the same view when Carroll circulated his privately printed versions of the problem. As Carroll noted, \"I am in correspondence with about a dozen logicians on this curious point; & so far, opinions appear equally divided as to C's freedom\"."]}, {"page": "Harold H.

He became Wykeham Professor of Logic of the University of Oxford from 1919, succeeding the realist John Cook Wilson, and occupied the chair until his death. Whilst at Oxford he taught the American poet T.S. Eliot.

(1985). The Elusive Self by Hywel D. Lewis; Selfless Persons by Steven Collins. Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. Vol. 45, No. 3. pp. 461\u2013465. The philosopher Gareth Matthews gave the book a negative review claiming Lewis had offered no evidence for dualism. On the subject of dreamless sleep, Lewis wrote the self ceases to be. According to Matthews the belief that the self can pop in and out of existence would be alarming to some readers but Lewis had no problem with accepting this view. Matthews concluded that Lewis's controversial claims were deliberately left with no direct argumentative support. Eugene Long gave the book a positive review stating Lewis had given an adequate defence for the dualistic position and the existence of the self.Long, Eugene. (1985). The Elusive Self by H. D. Lewis.
