Whittaker played as a defender. \nWhittaker began his career with Hibernian and made over 170 appearances in his first spell with the Easter Road side. He also won the Scottish League Cup in 2007 before signing for Rangers in August that year. Whittaker won three Scottish Premier League titles, two Scottish Cups and three Scottish League Cups with Rangers. At the start of the 2012\u201313 season, he signed for Norwich City on a free transfer. After five years with Norwich, Whittaker returned to Hibernian in 2017, before moving to Dunfermline Athletic in 2020 in what would be his final season as a footballer.\nHe made 31 international appearances for the Scotland national team between 2009 and 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 16", "response": ["*  1984   \u2013 Steven Whittaker, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Midlothian", "response": ["*Steven Whittaker from Bonnyrigg, (born 1984), Scotland International footballer, ex-Hibernian F.C. and Rangers F.C."]}, {"page": "Easter Road", "response": ["Despite this development work, a move to a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site would allow them to clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work."]}, {"page": "Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["Mowbray left Hibs in October 2006 to manage West Bromwich Albion, and was replaced by former player John Collins.

Collins resigned later that year, frustrated by the lack of funds provided to sign new players.

A win against St Johnstone in Williamson's first match in charge effectively removed the danger of relegation. Due to financial problems at the club, Williamson had to move on several senior players, but he did not endear himself to the Hibs fans. He lightheartedly joked about this relationship by referring to himself as a \"weegie hun\". Nonetheless Hibs produced several excellent young players, including Scott Brown, Derek Riordan, Garry O'Connor, Kevin Thomson and Steven Whittaker.

He was one of a group of young players who came through their youth team during the early 2000s, also including Steven Whittaker, Derek Riordan, Scott Brown and Garry O'Connor. Thomson established himself as a regular in the Hibernian first team during the 2003\u201304 season and played in that season's Scottish League Cup final defeat by Livingston, but he suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury during a game against Partick Thistle near the end of that season.

Brown made his first starting appearance the following week, in a 1\u20130 win against Motherwell. Brown then started in Hibs' remaining two matches of the season and scored in both, a double in a 2\u20131 win against Livingston and in a 3\u20132 defeat to Partick Thistle.

With the new ownership there initially appeared to be some financial stability of the club. A number of first-team regulars were secured on long-term contract extensions including Steven Davis, Allan McGregor, Steven Whittaker and Gregg Wylde. When McCoist entered the transfer market, his first signing being Almer\u00eda midfielder Juan Manuel Ortiz, he soon encountered difficulties.
