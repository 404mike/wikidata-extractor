Sections of the circuit will be known by names such as Rabbit Hole, Leap of Faith, Deanes Drop and The Breathtaker. The course is 5\u00a0km in length and features six prominent climbs and several smaller ones which mean that the riders climb for a total of 170 metres each lap. There are a number of rock gardens drop-offs constructed from imported Derbyshire gritstone. The circuit is set in open meadows meaning a lack of trees makes it perfect for the spectators to see what is happening.
