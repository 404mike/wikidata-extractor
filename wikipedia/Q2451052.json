She was seduced by Bo during their first meeting and hence fell in love with her. She has extensive knowledge of the different types of Fae and their abilities. In the first season, she helped Bo learn how to control her powers so that she could have sex with both Fae and humans without hurting or killing them. It is later revealed that she had a human girlfriend, Nadia, who had fallen into a coma five years earlier after contracting a mysterious virus while in the Congo with her. In exchange for her servitude, the Ash offered Lauren access to the Light Fae's laboratory and resources to find a cure for Nadia's condition. Lauren learned from Lachlan in \"Masks\", that she was tricked by the previous Ash; he ordered a Dark Fae Shaman to curse Nadia into a coma to ensure that Lauren would do everything in her power to find an antidote to the fever that was killing Fae and then pulled her into the Light clan's fold. After Bo (unbeknownst to Lauren) removed the curse, Lauren and Nadia reunited; but their relationship was soon shattered when it was revealed that Nadia had been infected by the Garuda, and he could control her mind and body. Bo was forced to kill Nadia when she threatened Lauren's life. In \"Caged Fae\", Bo asked Lauren to be with her in a committed relationship; however, disappointed and feeling inadequate in satisfying Bo's succubus nature, Lauren told Bo that she needed a \"break\" from the relationship. Lauren walked away from servitude to The Ash and protection by the Light Fae afterwards. In \"Adventures In Fae-bysitting\", a part of Lauren's past is disclosed and we learned that her real name is Karen Beattie and that she is a fugitive wanted by the International Criminal Offences and Criminal Intelligence Bureau. In \"Turn to Stone\", Lauren revealed that she had a brother, they had been inseparable and decided together \"to change the world\", but their cause had turned into blowing up pipelines. She knew how to build pipe bombs and made them for her brother to position; however, one location was supposed to have been deserted but wasn't and eleven people were killed in the explosion. This led to her going on the run, changing her identity, and keep running ever since (by the details in the ICOCIB wanted poster, the incident occurred in 1998, when Lauren was 17 or 18 years old. She is also fluent in Spanish, French and Swahili). In \"Those Who Wander\", Lauren sabotaged Dr. Isaac Taft's plan to extract Dyson's DNA and transfer the cells into him so as to become a Wolf-Shapeshifter and turned Taft into a human/Cabbit hybrid instead, making him an easy kill for Dyson. She went missing thereafter. In \"Let the Dark Times Roll\", Bo and Lauren were reunited at a Dark Fae party. Lauren told Bo that she had fled for her life after the Una Mens began to kill humans. The Dark Fae (i.e. the Morrigan) came looking for her, offering refuge, protection, and freedom to come and go as she pleased in exchange for working for the clan. They remained friends, putting behind them their previous tensions. In \"End of Faes\", Bo asked Lauren to be together again, as a couple. In the season five finale, she is reunited with Bo as a couple.", "On April 6, 2010, Prodigy Pictures reported that principal photography had begun with production scheduled to wrap in June 2010: \"Filming will take place at a West Toronto soundstage and on location in the vicinities of Toronto and Hamilton until June 25, 2010.
