B. Malik) is a British author and banker. His book \"Double Standards - BCCI, The Untold Story\" was published in March 2016 in the United Kingdom. It was officially launched at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) on 14 May 2016 and has received positive reviews in the news media for describing the facts surrounding the forced closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).BCCI was at one time the 7th largest private bank in the world, boasting assets of over $20 billion with 16,000 employees in 500 offices spanning 72 countries. The book provides ground-breaking evidence to prove that BCCI did not 'collapse', was not a criminal enterprise, was fully solvent and that the closure of the bank was a political move by the regulators under pressure from the United States. The book highlights the Double Standards of the regulatory authorities and undertakes an academic analysis of  the punishment meted out to BCCI in comparison to the treatment of more serious fraud & crimes (LIBOR, Madoff etc) committed by the major big banks of today following the Financial Crisis of 2008, who are let off the hook with measly fines and penalties, under the pretense of being 'Too Big to Indict' or 'systemically important'.\nPoliticians, businessmen and academics have lauded Malik's efforts for showing the \u2018courage\u2019 to challenge the mainstream narrative about BCCI and its legendary visionary founder Agha Hasan Abedi - \u201cThe young author has made us proud; he has done what we could not do,\u201d said Sirajuddin Aziz, President and CEO of Habib Metro Bank.The 2016 Hollywood film 'The Infiltrator' starring Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston describes the undercover US Customs agent Bob Mazur's fake money laundering scheme to entrap BCCI in an elaborate sting operation. Malik strongly contests the narrative of the movie in his book as the Tampa Sting in Florida was an isolated case of entrapment and BCCI was never found guilty of money laundering anywhere in the world. He also questions why no other bank in the world was targeted in a sting operation ever since by Mazur given the global money laundering market was over $200billion at the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of alumni of Queen Mary University of London", "response": ["* Mubashir Malik - British author, actor and banker"]}, {"page": "List of Pakistani films of 2016", "response": ["| Lahore Se Aagey || Road, Comedy|| Wajahat Rauf || Yasir Hussain, Saba Qamar, Mubashir Malik, Rubina Ashraf, Behroze Sabzwari, Atiqa Odho, Abdullah Farhatullah, Hasan Rizvi, Omer Sultan, Ashir Wajahat, Ahmed Ali ||"]}, {"page": "Lahore Se Aagey", "response": ["Lahore Se Aagey (; ) is a 2016 Pakistani road-comedy romantic film directed by Wajahat Rauf, written by Yasir Hussain and Produced by Wajahat Rauf, Asfand Faruok, Salman Iqbal, and Jarjees Seja.
