One definition is as a sheaf over a ringed space; this is sometimes called the \"algebro-geometric approach\".Alice Rogers, Supermanifolds: Theory and Applications, World Scientific, (2007)  (See Chapter 1) This approach has a mathematical elegance, but can be problematic in various calculations and intuitive understanding. A second approach can be called a \"concrete approach\", as it is capable of simply and naturally generalizing a broad class of concepts from ordinary mathematics. It requires the use of an infinite number of supersymmetric generators in its definition; however, all but a finite number of these generators carry no content, as the concrete approach requires the use of a coarse topology that renders almost all of them equivalent. Surprisingly, these two definitions,  one with a finite number of supersymmetric generators, and one with an infinite number of generators, are equivalent.Rogers, Op. Cit. (See Chapter 8.)", "Historically, this approach is associated with Alice Rogers, Bryce DeWitt and work by Jadczyk and Pilch.A. Jadczyk, K. Pilch, \"Superspaces and supersymmetries\". Comm. Math.
