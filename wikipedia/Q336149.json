Such development in securing its own degree-awarding powers brought the need for King's to design its own academic dress. During the transition phase, global fashion icon Dame Vivienne Westwood was approached by Patricia Rawlings, Baroness Rawlings, then Chairperson of King's College London, to design an academic gown of the institution. Working with Ede & Ravenscroft, the producers of the academic dress, the Westwood-designed academic dresses for King's College London have been unveiled in 2008. On the gowns, Vivienne Westwood commented: \"Through my reworking of the traditional robe I tried to link the past, the present and the future. We are what we know.\""]}, {"page": "List of related life peers", "response": ["*** 15px David Wolfson, Baron Wolfson of Sunningdale (1935 \u2014 2021) ~ 15px Patricia Rawlings, Baroness Rawlings (b. 1939)"]}, {"page": "List of female members of the House of Lords", "response": ["|Patricia Rawlings, Baroness RawlingsConservative MEP 1989-1994"]}]}}
