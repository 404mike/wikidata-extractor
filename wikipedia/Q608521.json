He began singing as a child, and became known after performing at a working men's club. He came to attention in 1999 when he sang \"God Save the Queen\" at the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, \"Barcelona\" at the last match of the Premiership season between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, and a full set of songs at the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final in Barcelona between Manchester United and Bayern Munich.\nWatson's debut album The Voice was released in May 2001; four others followed. An album planned for November 2006 was delayed due to the removal of a benign pituitary tumour. This album, titled That's Life, was eventually released on 5 March 2007.\nOn 24 October 2007, it was discovered that there had been a regrowth of the pituitary tumour and bleeding into Watson's brain. He underwent emergency surgery and was discharged from hospital on 31 October. He underwent an extensive rehabilitation programme, including radiotherapy. His sixth studio album, Outside In, was released on 26 November 2007.\nOn 22 November 2010, Watson released La Voce, his first album since overcoming the brain tumour .On 18 November 2020, Watson spent his first night within the celebrity camp, following confirmation that he would be a late competitor and participant in the twentieth series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here broadcast from the Grade 1, listed Gwrych Castle, in North Wales, UK.

The theme was revealed to be a cover of the Rod Stewart single \"Faith of the Heart\", by British tenor Russell Watson. Stewart's song had originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 film Patch Adams. For the use in Enterprise, it was retitled to \"Where My Heart Will Take Me\", but prompted a negative reaction from existing Star Trek fans. These included an online petition to have the song removed, and there was a protest held outside of Paramount Studios. Executive producers Braga and Berman both defended the choice, with Berman saying that the fan response was split over the song while Braga said that some people found the song \"uplifting\". The U2 song 'Beautiful Day' had been used as a temp track on the test reels before \"Faith of the Heart\" was chosen."]}, {"page": "2002 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["The Project & Artistic Director for the Opening Ceremony was David Zolkwer.
