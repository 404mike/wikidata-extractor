He was professor of English literature at Lancaster University. During World War Two, he served in Burma.\nSherry was born in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England, the younger twin (by eleven minutes) of Alan. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.  He also wrote on Joseph Conrad, Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb, and Jane Austen.  His Life of Graham Greene was praised by David Lodge for being \"a remarkable and heroic achievement\" that he predicted would prove \"the definitive biography of record\" of Greene.From 1983, Sherry held the post of Mitchell Distinguished Professor of Literature at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas.\nHe was married three times: first to the children's novelist Sylvia Sherry, then to Carmen Flores (with whom he had a son and a daughter), and finally to Pat Villalon. Sherry died on 19 October 2016 at the age of 91.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heart of Darkness", "response": ["There have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. Georges-Antoine Klein, an agent who became ill and died aboard Conrad's steamer, is proposed by literary critics as a basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous \"rear column\" of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, slave trader Tippu Tip and the expedition leader, Welsh explorer Henry Morton Stanley. Conrad's biographer Norman Sherry judged that Arthur Hodister (1847\u20131892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by Congolese to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis.

In his history book King Leopold's Ghost, Adam Hochschild suggests that L\u00e9on Rom, an administrator in King Leopold's Congo, i.e. in the Congo Free State, was the principal inspiration for the Kurtz character, citing references as the heads on the stakes outside of the station and other similarities between the two. Hochschild and other authors have also suggested that the fate of the disastrous \"rear column\" of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition (1886\u20138) on the Congo may have also been an influence. Column leader Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, \"went mad, began hitting, whipping, and killing people, and was finally murdered\". Bloom notes that Kurtz's sophisticated brutality is closer to that of Barttelot's associate slave trader Tippu Tip. The expedition's overall leader, Henry Morton Stanley, the principal figure involved in preparing the Congo for Leopold's rule, may also have been an influence.Hochschild, Adam: King Leopold's Ghost.
