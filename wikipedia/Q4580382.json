He later joined the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). After kidnapping a Dublin dentist and cutting off two of his fingers in 1987 he was imprisoned until 2006, when he was granted extended temporary release.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Irish National Liberation Army", "response": ["Directly after the feud in October 1987, the INLA received more damaging publicity when Dessie O'Hare, an erstwhile INLA volunteer, set up his own group called the \"Irish Revolutionary Brigade\" and kidnapped a Dublin dentist named John O'Grady. O'Hare cut off two of O'Grady's fingers and sent them to his family in order to secure a ransom. O'Grady was eventually rescued and O'Hare's group arrested after several shootouts with armed Garda\u00ed. The INLA disassociated itself from the action, issuing a statement saying O'Hare \"is not a member of the INLA\".Holland, McDonald, INLA Deadly Divisions, pp.304\u2013305 O'Hare later rejoined the INLA while in prison."]}, {"page": "Dominic McGlinchey", "response": ["The Officials, comments the journalist Liam Clarke, made a \"determined effort to strangle the breakaway INLA at birth\". A bloody feud soon broke out between the groups in Belfast which killed six men. Costello had fought in the Border campaign in south County Londonderry \"and his reputation still carried weight in the area; his new organisation had no difficulty in winning recruits from the Officials\", suggest Holland and McDonald. By 1977, the area's almost entire Official IRA membership had joined them. Founder members included Jimmy Brown, Tom McCartan, Gino Gallagher, Dessie O'Hare, John \"Jap\" O'Reilly, Gerard \"Sparky\" Barkley and Gerard \"Dr Death\" Steenson, most of whom McGlinchey would fight with over the next decade.", "Money and weapons were essential for the INLA's campaign, and McGlinchey\u2014by now accompanied by Dessie O'Hare\u2014organised a number of bank and Securicor robberies, on one occasion stealing \u00a3100,000 in a single raid. This allowed tentative plans to buy arms from the United States to be put into effect, although, in the event, the plan came to nothing. Another two robberies in Cork brought the group \u00a3300,000 between them. Another favourite fundraising technique was fraud, one case of which was meant to have netted the group \u00a3140,000 in stolen bankers' orders. However, \u00c9amon McMahon from South Armagh, whose job it was to cash the orders, paid nothing. McMahon was an associate of Patrick Mackin\u2014with whom McGlinchey was involved in a personal feud\u2014and, to resolve the issue, both men agreed to meet Mary McGlinchey in the Imperial Hotel in Dundalk. Trusting her, suggest Holland and McDonald, \"was a fatal mistake\": Mary had lured them there for her husband to kill."]}]}}
