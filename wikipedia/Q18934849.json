Of these hundreds of drawings, about a quarter relate to known paints or prints done by Sirani. Sirani kept a meticulous list and records of her paintings and who commissioned them beginning in 1655, which is recorded in Malvasia's biography. Many of her paintings are signed.Malvasia 1678, Vol II, 467-76 and Italian Women Artists, 241. By Sirani signing her paintings when her male counterparts did not, this could be because she did not want her work to be confused with that of her father, her signature also offered a way to further prove her powers of invention, which, according to Ann Sutherland Harris, distinguished her from other Italian women artists. Sirani's exceptional prodigiousness was the product of how quickly she painted. She painted so many works that many doubted that she painted them all herself. To refute such charges she invited her accusers on 13 May 1664 to watch her paint a portrait in one sitting."]}, {"page": "Linda Nochlin", "response": ["* 1976 \u2014 \"Women Artists: 1550-1950\" (with Ann Sutherland Harris) at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.", "Alongside Global Feminisms, Nochlin also co-curated Women Artists: 1550-1950, the first international art exhibition created solely by female artists on December 21, 1976.

All three wear robes in bright primary colours: blue over red (Mary), yellow over blue (Peter) and pink over green (Paul). The remaining space around the sarcophagus is filled with nine other apostles, bringing their overall number to eleven. \"The stiffened forms and crowded composition [...] have been interpreted as a conscious shift to a 'hyper-idealized' manner that rejects the warmth and painterly qualities of his Bolognese period for a style indebted to ancient sculpture and to Raphael. Still neither ancient reliefs nor Raphael crowded their pictorial fields in this way\", says Ann Sutherland Harris.Ann Sutherland Harris: Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture, Laurence King Publishing, London, 2005, p. 43"]}, {"page": "In Her Own Image", "response": ["In Her Own Image: Women Working in the Arts is an American feminist anthology published by Feminist Press from Old Westbury, New York on March 1, 1980, and is a part of the Press\u2019 larger series entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Lives, Women\u2019s Work\u201d.
