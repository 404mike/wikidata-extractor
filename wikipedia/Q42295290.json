Private chapels were built in Ryde, but it was only in 1839 that the new vicar of Newchurch set up a committee to found a conventional parish church in the town.  Rapid population growth led to the construction of a \"large and lofty\" stone church capable of holding 800 worshippers.  It was designed in the Early English Gothic Revival style by one of the island's most prolific architects, Ryde resident Thomas Hellyer.", "The foundation stone was laid on 16 October 1841 in the presence of the Bishop of Winchester by Elizabeth Lydia Lind, widow of the late John Lind,  The church was designed by the local architect Thomas Hellyer and built by Langdon and Denham, a local construction firm.

He designed many churches there and on the mainland, as well as other buildings, and his output has been described as \"remarkable\" and \"very individualistic\". Holy Trinity was the largest of his churches on the island, although it was not built fully to his original design: cost constraints meant that a small apse at the east end had to replace the large sanctuary he intended.

Yarmouth (1626) retains much of its original appearance; St Mary's Church at Cowes dates from 1657 but has been rebuilt; and rebuilding of older churches took place at Newchurch, Shalfleet, Shorwell and Godshill.   Monuments to prominent island families such as the Oglander and Worsley baronets and the Leighs of Godshill are another important feature of this era.  At several churches, though, church architecture and fittings of this era and of the 18th century was swept away amid Victorian restoration, and the island's stock of Anglican churches grew substantially in the 19th century in line with urban growth and the splitting up of ancient parishes.  New churches replaced smaller medieval buildings at St Lawrence (1878, by George Gilbert Scott) and Bonchurch (by Benjamin Ferrey, 1847\u201348) and the ruined chapel in the hamlet of Newtown (1835, by local architect A. F. Livesay).  In St Helens, the ruined Norman-era church dedicated to St Helena was replaced further inland in 1717, but the new church was rebuilt in 1829 and substantially altered and extended in 1862.  Many Anglican churches on the island were either built or reconstructed in the 1850s or 1860s, mostly in a range of Gothic Revival styles\u2014some with distinctive features such as the tower at Whippingham, the tall spire at Holy Trinity, Ventnor and the interior of St Mary's, Cowes, where a new church with a complex polychrome brickwork interior was grafted on to the \"remarkable\" tower designed by John Nash.  Thomas Hellyer of Ryde, described by Nikolaus Pevsner as a \"very individualistic\" and \"remarkable\" architect, was responsible for several churches in this era\u2014both new buildings (at Bembridge, Havenstreet, Oakfield, Seaview, St Saviour's at Shanklin and the now closed Holy Trinity at Ryde) and rebuilding work (at Binstead and East Cowes).", "|The first church in this village\u2014usually attributed to John Nash, although some sources name Portsmouth architect Jacob Owen\u2014dated from 1827 and was a plain Gothic Revival building.  Structurally unsound, it was replaced 19 years later by Thomas Hellyer's church of Swanage stone, which consists of a five-bay nave, chancel, spire-topped tower with three bells and a clock, and an aisle and side chapel on the south side.  Bath stonework dominates the interior.  The church was consecrated on 22 July 1846.", "|The church has extensive herringbone brickwork, suggesting an early Norman date, and it was built  1150 for workers at the nearby limestone quarries.  The nave was rebuilt to the design of Thomas Hellyer in 1845, though, at a cost of \u00a31,800.  The \"sophisticated\" lancet windows date from the 13th century.  Some of the internal features were moved here from Winchester College Chapel after it was refitted in 1932, and the nave and some fittings had to be repaired in 1969 after a fire.", "|John Nash, who designed the original church here and lived at East Cowes Castle, is buried in the churchyard with his wife.  Nash's building of 1831\u201333 (described by Sir John Summerson as \"excessively plain Gothic\"), whose foundation stone was laid by Princess Victoria just before she became Queen, was comprehensively enlarged and redesigned between 1868 and 1870 by Thomas Hellyer in an unconventional interpretation of the Gothic Revival style.  The tower was retained, however, the and Nash tomb is next to its base.", "|The village is mostly Victorian\u2014John Rylands was a major benefactor\u2014and the church dates from 1852.  Thomas Hellyer designed it with his characteristic narrow lancet windows using rough-hewn limestone from the local area.  There is no tower or spire\u2014only a bell-cot\u2014and the church lacks aisles or transepts.  The parish was created one year after the church opened.  The architecture of the \"delightfully scaled\" church is Early English Gothic Revival.", "|This Gothic Revival church cost \u00a31,600 and was consecrated in 1843.  It was originally a chapel of ease within St Helens parish, although Ryde's suburban growth soon surrounded it.  Thomas Hellyer, who had designed the Gothic Revival chapel, accordingly extended and remodelled it as a cruciform structure in 1870.  A Lady chapel was added in 1914 to commemorate Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, 7th Baron Calthorpe, and in 1954 the chancel was extended further.", "|A late work by Giles Gilbert Scott, this church replaced the small medieval chapel nearby, which still stands.  There is no tower or spire, only a bell-cot, which is \"nicely integrated\" with the buttresses at the west end.  Members of Morris & Co. were responsible for much of the stained glass: most was designed for the church, but some was rescued from Thomas Hellyer's demolished Royal National Hospital for Diseases of the Chest in nearby Ventnor and was installed in the church in 1975.", "|Thomas Hellyer designed the first part of the church in 1859\u201362.  When it opened it was a chapel of ease to St Helen's Church, but a parish was created in 1907.  Extensions and additions were built in around 1871, 1920 (to the design of Stephen Salter), 1973 and 1984.  The church's \"most memorable feature\" is the elaborate rood screen of 1909, designed by the firm of Jones & Willis (as were the contemporary choir stalls), and there is stained glass by William Morris.  The spire was removed in the 1960s because of structural problems.", "|\"The church of seaside Shanklin\" stands on a high cliff above the beach and was opened in 1869.  Thomas Hellyer was responsible for the early parts of the building; the chancel and nave date from then, and his south aisle was completed two years later.  T.E.C. Streatfield added the north aisle, also of four bays, in 1875\u201376.  The tower and spire were completed in 1887 to the design of W.O. Milne, bells were hung the following year, and the same architect extended the church to the west in 1903\u201305.  Architect Sir Charles Nicholson, 2nd Baronet designed the reredos in the Lady chapel in 1948, just before his death."]}, {"page": "List of places of worship in Portsmouth", "response": ["|Architect Thomas Hellyer designed this Neo-Norman church in 1858\u201361 to serve an area historically known as Marylebone and considered at the time \"the roughest and most dangerous\" in the city.  Despite this, the flint and stone building is \"still rural in feel\".  The \"pleasing\" interior has yellow, red and black brickwork, a hammerbeam roof and some stained glass.  The parish has been combined with that of the redundant St Peter's Church at Somers Town.", "|Thomas Hellyer's \"rather grand\" church of 1864\u201366 serves East Southsea, which had been served by a temporary church since 1862.  There is no tower or spire, but the roof is tall and steeply gabled.  The chancel has an apse at the east end.  The style is Decorated Gothic Revival and the church is built of yellow brick with polychromatic brick interior decoration.  A parish was formed in 1868 when the church (which cost \u00a34,500) was consecrated.  St Simon's Mission Hall stood on Albert Road and was supported by the church."]}]}}
