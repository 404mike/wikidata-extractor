The book itself came out in six great folios. The first volume appeared in September 1654; the second in July 1655; the third in July 1656; and the last three in 1657. Nine languages are used: Hebrew, Aramaic, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Ethiopic, Greek and Latin. Among his collaborators were James Ussher, John Lightfoot and Edward Pococke, Edmund Castell, Abraham Wheelocke and Patrick Young, Thomas Hyde and Thomas Greaves. The great undertaking was the first in England supported by subscription - \u00a350 each. Walton's political opinions did not deprive him of the help of the Commonwealth; the paper used was freed from duty, and the interest of Cromwell in the work was acknowledged in the original preface, part of which was afterwards cancelled to make way for more loyal expressions towards that restored monarchy under which Oriental studies in England immediately began to languish. Two versions of the work, one dedicated to Cromwell, and the other known as the \"Loyal\" one. To Walton himself, however, the Restoration brought no disappointment: he was elected Bishop of Chester on 19 October 1660, confirmed to that See 22 November, and consecrated a bishop on 2 December 1660. In the following spring he was one of the commissioners at the Savoy Conference, but took little part in the business. In the autumn of 1661 he paid a short visit to his diocese, and returning to London he died."]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Library", "response": ["Various scholars have held the position.

He was a friend, probably a nephew, of the learned nonjuror, George Hickes, of Humphrey Wanley, Sir Andrew Fountaine, John Strype, and other men of learning. In 1701 he contributed a Latin translation of the homily of Lupus to the Dissertatio Epistolaris.Hickes's Thesaurus.Thesaurus, part iii. page 99 Hickes wrote a preface to Elstob's Essay on the great Affinity and Mutual Agreement of the two professions of Divinity and Law, ... in vindication of the Clergy's concerning themselves in political matters. It is a defence of high-church principles. Sir Andrew Fountaine acknowledges Elstob's help in giving descriptions of Saxon coins for the tables published by him in Hickes's Thesaurus.Thesaurus, part iii. page 166 Elstob communicated to John Strype a copy of Sir John Cheke's Discourse upon Plutarch's Treatise on Superstition. This had been preserved in manuscript in the library of University College, and mutilated by Obadiah Walker. Elstob's version is appended to Strype's Life of Cheke. In 1703 Elstob published a new edition (much enlarged) of Roger Ascham's 'Letters.' In 1709 he contributed a Latin version of the Saxon homily on the nativity of St. Gregory to the edition of the original prepared by his younger sister Elizabeth Elstob.  An Anglo-Saxon book of hours, with a translation by him, is appended to Letters between Hickes and a Roman Catholic priest. He made collections for a history of Newcastle and of 'proper names formerly used in northern countries.' He also made proposals for what was to be his great work, a new edition of the Saxon laws already published by Lombarde (1568) and Abraham Wheelocke (1644), with many additions, comments, prefaces, and glossaries. This design was stopped by his death, and afterwards executed bv David Wilkins, Leges Anglo-Saxoni\u00e6, etc. (1721), who mentions Elstob's plan in his preface. Hickes also speaks of this plan in the dedication of his two volumes of posthumous sermons (1726). Elstob prepared a version of \u00c6lfred's Orosius, which finally came into the hands of Daines Barrington.
