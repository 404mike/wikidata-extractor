Some of his earlier work was shown at EASTinternational in 1995 where one of his pieces was purchased for the Arts Council Collection. Also after graduating Fitzmaurice developed an interest in working in non-gallery situations by co-organising a number of 'artist-led' projects such as All in the Mind (1998), with artist Patricia McKinnon Day, which took place inside a disused mental asylum; and Up In The Air/Further Up In The Air (1999\u20132004) with artist Neville Gabie, which used tower blocks as contexts for art and writing. In these projects Fitzmaurice worked with the artists and writers George Shaw, Julian Stallabrass, Elizabeth Wright, Lothar Gotz, Will Self, Anna Fox, Marcus Coates and Bill Drummond amongst others.Further Up in the Air.
