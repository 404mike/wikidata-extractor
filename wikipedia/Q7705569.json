During the construction and opening of the Library of Birmingham on the square in 2013 several of the elements of the 1991 design were removed and a library amphitheatre was built into the square. In 2014 a design competition was held to redesign the square. Construction of the redesigned square began in 2017 and was largely complete in 2019.", "To complement the International Convention Centre and Symphony Hall the square was redeveloped in 1989 and renamed Centenary Square to commemorate 100 year since Birmingham attained city status. The \u00a33.5 million construction of Centenary Way, a bridge across the Inner Ring Road linking Paradise Circus to Centenary Square was essential in creating an uninterrupted pedestrian route with the city centre, pedestrians previously had to cross beneath the road in an underground subway. The colonnade at the western end of the square was relocated to St. Thomas' Peace Garden. Artist Tess Jaray designed the railings, street furniture and paving for the square which included 525,000 pavers to be laid out in the design of a Persian Rug. Jaray was assisted by Tom Lomax. It had originally been planned for Jaray to design paving for the interior of the convention centre. Lomax designed the Spirit of Enterprise fountain which stood in the centre of the square, David Patten designed Industry and Genius an artwork dedicated to John Baskerville, located outside Baskerville House. As the centrepiece to the square was Forward an artwork named after the city motto, designed by Raymond Mason the sculpture stood on a podium centrally within the square. The square officially opened in 1991."]}, {"page": "Royal Academy Summer Exhibition", "response": ["*2012: Tess Jaray"]}, {"page": "W. G.
