A major triumph of the equations of this theory is their ability to explain the Meissner effect, wherein a material exponentially expels all internal magnetic fields as it crosses the superconducting threshold. By using the London equation, one can obtain the dependence of the magnetic field inside the superconductor on the distance to the surface."]}, {"page": "Meissner effect", "response": ["The Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers Fritz and Heinz London, who showed that the electromagnetic free energy in a superconductor is minimized provided", "The discovery of the Meissner effect led to the phenomenological theory of superconductivity by Fritz and Heinz London in 1935. This theory explained resistanceless transport and the Meissner effect, and allowed the first theoretical predictions for superconductivity to be made. However, this theory only explained experimental observations\u2014it did not allow the microscopic origins of the superconducting properties to be identified. This was done successfully by the BCS theory in 1957, from which the penetration depth and the Meissner effect result.

These screening currents are generated whenever a superconducting material is brought inside a magnetic field.  This can be understood by the fact that a superconductor has zero electrical resistance, so that eddy currents, induced by the motion of the material inside a magnetic field, will not decay.  Fritz, at the Royal Society in 1935, stated that the thermodynamic state would be described by a single wave function."]}, {"page": "MAUD Committee", "response": ["The division of the MAUD Committee at Oxford was led by Simon.
