He was born and died in Newcastle upon Tyne.\nHe was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. As well as playing for Cambridge, he also played two first-class games for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University and against his alma mater. Bastard never scored highly, making 0, 11, 0, 5, 9, 11, 0, 0* and 5 in his first-class innings. Although the bowling records of the matches in which he played are not complete, he is not recorded to have bowled at first-class level, and certainly did not take a wicket. He did, however, hold three catches.\nIn later life, Bastard became a clergyman, serving as a Navy Chaplain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "JH Bastard", "response": ["#redirect John Bastard (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "J.H.
