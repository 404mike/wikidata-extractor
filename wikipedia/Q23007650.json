A week later winger Chris Johnston left the club on an emergency loan - joining Peterhead. The same day defender Aidan Wilson joined on an emergency loan from Rangers. After defeat to Greenock Morton in the Scottish Cup Aitken re-entered the emergency loan market, to add midfielder Liam Burt on a 28 day loan from Rangers. There was reason to be cheerful a day later, as Dumbarton made it to their first major national cup final for more than 100 years. Danny Handling's first goal for the club was followed by a stunning, late, Dimitris Froxylias free-kick, as Sons overcame Welsh Premier League Champions The New Saints to reach the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup. Four days later, and back on league action, Sons suffered defeat at the hands of Greenock Morton - despite a strong first half showing. Next up was a 0-0 draw with eighth placed Falkirk - a result that left the Sons still searching for their first league goal of 2018.", "April opened with a 2-0 midweek defeat against Dundee United. Four days later Sons faced the same opponents, and won 3-2, having gone ahead three times thanks to goals from Calum Gallagher and a brace from Craig Barr. It was then announced that Helensburgh based solicitor John Steele would become the club's new Chairman during the summer, replacing Les Hope who took up the role in May 2017. On the park meanwhile a last minute defeat to Greenock Morton left the Sons eight points adrift of eighth placed Falkirk with just four games remaining. Ninth place was confirmed after two defeats in five days to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, coupled with victory for Falkirk against Champions St Mirren, left the Sons 11 points adrift with just two matches remaining. During the match goalkeeper Jamie Ewings made his first league appearance for the club since May 2016 as a substitute for the injured Scott Gallacher. Ewings' first start followed, in a 5-2 defeat to Falkirk where Liam Burt scored his first goal for the club. Post-match Andy Dowie was named as the club's Player of the Year, Christopher McLaughlin won Young Player of the Year and Craig Barr won Players' Player of the Year. The league season ended with a 4-0 defeat to Dunfermline Athletic with Barr sent off after just nine minutes, setting up a playoff semi-final tie with Arbroath.", "| Liam Burt", "|MF||style=\"text-align:left\"| Liam Burt ||4||15||1||1|| 0 ||0"]}, {"page": "2018 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|MF||31||  Liam Burt "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Liam Burt"]}, {"page": "List of foreign League of Ireland players", "response": ["* Liam Burt \u2013 Bohemians"]}, {"page": "PFAI Team of the Year", "response": ["!scope=row|Liam Burt "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Celtic F.C. season", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Liam Burt"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Liam Burt"]}]}}
