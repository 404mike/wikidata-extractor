They were interested in inflatable architecture as well as in the shapes that could be generated from plastic. Ron Herron, also a member of Archigram, created blob-like architecture in his projects from the 1960s, such as Walking Cities and Instant City, as did Michael Webb with Sin Centre.Archigram,  Peter Cook, editor (Princeton Architectural Press, 1999).   Buckminster Fuller's work with geodesic domes provided both stylistic and structural precedents. Geodesic domes form the building blocks for works including The Eden Project. Niemeyer's Edificio Copan built in 1957 undulates nonsymetrically invoking the irregular non-linearity often seen in blobitecture. There was a climate of experimental architecture with an air of psychedelia in the 1970s that these were a part of.   The Flintstone House by William Nicholson in 1976, was built over large inflated balloons. Frederick Kiesler's unbuilt, Endless House is another instance of early blob-like architecture, although it is symmetrical in plan and designed before computers; his design for the Shrine of the Book (construction begun, 1965) which has the characteristic droplet form of fluid also anticipates forms that interest architects today. Similarly, one would have to include the work of Vittorio Giorgini (Casa Saldarini), Pascal Ha\u00fcsermann and especially that of Antti Lovag as examples of successfully built blobs.

Notably in its December 1955 issue, Banham contributed an essay titled \"The New Brutalism\", in which he sought to stylistically define New Brutalism. His hypotheses became widely discussed and debated topics among members of Team X and other groups involved in urban planning at the time. Banham also had connections with the Independent Group, the 1956 This Is Tomorrow art exhibition \u2013 considered by many to the birth of pop art \u2013 and the exponents of Brutalist architecture, which he documented in his 1966 book The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?. Before this, in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, he had cut across mentor Pevsner's main theories, linking modernism to built structures in which the 'functionalism' was actually subject to formal structures. Later, he wrote a Guide to Modern Architecture (1962, later titled Age of the Masters, a Personal View of Modern Architecture). Banham predicted a \"second age\" of the machine and mass consumption. The Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment (1969) follows Giedion's Mechanization Takes Command (1948), putting the development of technologies such as electricity and air conditioning ahead of the classic account of structures. In the 1960s, Cedric Price, Peter Cook, and the Archigram group also found this to be an absorbing arena of thought."]}, {"page": "Zvi Hecker", "response": ["Zvi Hecker was born as Tadeusz Hecker in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.

The concept of removable and interchangeable elements of buildings would later become a widespread characteristic within the high-tech style. Less direct precursors included Buckminster Fuller and Frei Otto, whose focus on minimizing construction resources generated an emphasis on tensile structures, another important element in many high-tech designs.
