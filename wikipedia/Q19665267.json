He was listed first followed by Ren\u00e9 Lacoste and Bill Tilden. This was the result of his overall season, that as usual commenced on the French Riviera. Prior to that he was drafted into a Queen's Club \u2013 Sporting Club de Paris warm-up team challenge. He contributed to the Parisian victory with two mixed and a singles win. The following month he swept almost all available Riviera titles from February to March. He kicked off the tour by winning his first mixed New Courts L.T.C title with his U.S. Championships partner Eileen Bennett. In February he successfully defended his M\u00e9tropole Club and Gallia L.T.C. singles titles by defeating Henry Mayes twice in a row. In the Monaco Cup at the La Festa Country Club Cochet turned the tide from two sets down against two-times reigning champion B\u00e9la von Kehrling, the first meeting of a rivalry that continued onward into the year. They both reached the mixed doubles final, which remained unplayed and the prize was divided. The Cochet \u2013 Brugnon pair also won the Butler Cup there (reserved for doubles of the same nationality). At the Nice Lawn Tennis Club tournament they met again for the singles contest and Cochet won in straight sets. Cochet completed his second triple crown there. In Menton at the official Riviera Championships eventual singles victor Von Kehrling and former Danish Champion Erik Worm warded off Cochet and Count Salm in the doubles final. In the mixed Von Kehrling and Cilly Aussem beat the seasoned duo Cochet\u2013Bennett. His third C\u00f4te d'Azur trophy was granted to him after Otto Froitzheim traveled home before the final and gave him a walkover. One week later at the 50th Cannes Championships he reached the final to face Henry Mayes again, but due to misunderstandings he was 10 minutes late and had been defaulted from the tournament. Subsequently, he lost the mixed doubles match alongside Phyllis Satterthwaite and only found his form in the doubles with Jack Hillyard at the expense of their opponents Count Salm and Worm. In April at the Biarritz tournament Cochet routed compatriot Roger George in four sets. He was victorious in Marseilles versus Emmanuel Du Plaix and in the mixed with Cilly Aussem. The Miramar L.T.C. tournament in Juan-les-Pins resulted in a three set final between Ren\u00e9 Gall\u00e8pe of Monaco and Cochet and ended in favor of the Frenchman."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Jack Hillyard (1891\u20131983), British tennis player"]}, {"page": "1923 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles", "response": ["| Jack Hillyard ||align=\"center\"|6\u20133, 6\u20132, 7\u20135 ||  Alfredo Villegas"]}, {"page": "Surrey Championships", "response": ["| 1924 ||  Jack Hillyard ||  Henry Mayes || 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 10\u201312, 6\u20133, 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "Erik Worm", "response": ["Worm entered the last edition of the World Hard Court Championships in 1923 and advanced in the third round losing to count Manuel de Gomar. Between 1922 and 1925 he held the Danish Championships on numerous occasions collecting 8 titles altogether. In 1926 in his first oversees final in the Buffalo tennis and squash club invitational tournament he partnered with two-time singles champion Manuel Alonso for the doubles event, eventually falling to the home favorites Arnald Jones and George Lott. In February 1927 he reached the finals of the New Courts of Cannes mixed contest with Elizabeth Ryan. Next week at the Gallia L.T.C. of Cannes tournament came short in both doubles championship matches; in mixed with Ryan to Henri Cochet and Eileen Bennett and the men's with Ren\u00e9 Gall\u00e8pe to Cochet-Charles Aeschlimann. In June at the inaugural of the newly built Margaret Island courts of Budapest the Hungary Davis Cup team hosted an international meeting with Denmark with the latter team victorious. The score was 3-2, Worm beat Imre Tak\u00e1ts in four sets. In March 1928 at the Menton Cup he paired with Phyllis Satterthwaite and marched to the semifinal match against Cochet-Bennett with the latter team advancing to the final round. He took revenge on Cochet and his partner Salm in the doubles final where he and Kehrling won in straights The two of them went to the final of the singles where the Hungarian doubles partner beat him in a fierce fight. In April 1928 he found success in several tournaments throughout Europe, the Beausite mixed trophy with Ryan from Cochet and Satterthwaite (Worm also was a contender for the men's doubles), the Beaulieu tournament against George Lyttleton-Rogers and  the Pforzheim mixed doubles event in July again alongside Ryan. Next year he defended his Menton doubles title with Kehrling against the Italian duo of Giorgio de Stefani and Alberto del Bono. Although the defending champions split for the mixed and faced each other at the final with Kehrling making a good decision by choosing Cilly Aussem, while Worm and Satterthwaite finished second. In the April edition of the Monte-Carlo tournament Worm clinched the title by beating Junior Monaco champ Wilbur Coen. In mixed O'Connell and Elizabeth Ryan overcame Worm and Satterthwaite. In May George Lyttleton-Rogers had a clean victory over Worm in the singles last four of the L.T.C. Beaulieu tournament. He was more lucky in the doubles where he and Jack Hillyard became the Riviera champions after eliminating the Austrian Davis-Cup partners Hermann Artens and Ludwig Salm-Hoogstraeten. And in the follow-up mixed rematch of O'Connell-Ryan and Worm-Satterthwaite the Danish-Briton team equalized the tally. O'Connell and Worm met again in the mixed final of the Montreux tournament at Switzerland, where they played with Muriel Thomas and the returning Cilly Aussem respectively, but the latter team hadn't found his form yet. Then he toured the Weimar Republic and brought home several titles including the ones from Wiesbaden in doubles with Hector Fisher (also a singles runner-up versus Fisher), the Berlin Blau\u2014Weiss doubles with Fisher (also a singles runner-up versus Franz-Wilhelm Matejka)."]}, {"page": "Kent Championships", "response": ["|1924 ||  Algernon Kingscote ||  Jack Hillyard || 8\u20136, 9\u20137, 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston", "response": ["Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston was born in 1893 to Count Nicholai Felixovich Sumarokov-Elston reserve Lieutenant of the Cavalry Regiment and Countess Sofia Mikhaylovna Koskul.

He was the nephew of tennis player Count Pavel Sumarokov-Elston, who was his first coach and doubles partner, grandson of Count-General Felix Sumarokov-Elston, Governor of Kuban Oblast, and cousin of the infamous Prince Felix Yussupov, who later became known as one of the collaborators who conspired to kill Grigori Rasputin, cult leader and mentor of Empress consort of Russia Alexandra. Felix provided his own palace for the murder spot and also shot Rasputin once before murdering him with the help of his accomplices. Mikhail had a sister Elena and a brother Nicholas. At the age of twelve he had surgery on his right hand, which as a result was rendered unsuitable for tennis and he later switched to left-hand play. First he moved to Dresden and was trained by Kurt Bergmann and George K. Logie. In 1906 he entered the second-class tournament of the Bad Homburg Championships, where he defeated Jack Hillyard amongst many to claim his first title. With this he set a record of being the youngest winner ever at the time in the history of the tournament. In 1908 his father and brother died within two weeks of each other. He moved back to his homeland and graduated first at the Annenschule then at the Law Faculty of the St. Petersburg University."]}, {"page": "Jack Montagu Hillyard", "response": ["#redirectJack Hillyard"]}, {"page": "Welsh Championships (tennis)", "response": ["|1925 ||  Jack Hillyard ||  Elliott Williams Crawshay || 7\u20135, 6\u20132, 8\u201310, 6\u20131", "|1927 ||  David Williams ||  Jack Hillyard|| 8\u20136, 6\u20131, 3\u20136, 6\u20131"]}]}}
