He is noted for work in plant classification and evolution, and one of the instigators of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group-classification for flowering plants which is partly based on DNA studies. In particular he has researched orchids, and currently investigates ploidy and hybridization in NicotianaIn 1984, he received 'The George H.M. Lawrence Memorial Award', in the amount of $2,000, presented by the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Carnegie Mellon University and presented at the annual banquet of the Botanical Society of America.In 1998 he shared the Linnean Medal with Colin Patterson. In 2008 he was one of thirteen recipients of the Darwin-Wallace Medal, which was given every 50 years by the Linnean Society of London. Has been the Keeper of the Jodrell Laboratory and now is retired but still an horary research associate at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. He  is a fellow of the Royal Society.He was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malpighiales", "response": ["The molecular phylogenetic revolution led to a major restructuring of the order.

This study recovered a group of rosids unlike any group found in any previous system of plant classification. To make a clear break with classification systems being used at that time, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group resurrected Hutchinson's name,  though his concept of Malpighiales included much of what is now in Celastrales and Oxalidales."]}, {"page": "Marattiaceae", "response": ["In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, the Marattiales formed the single member of the class Marattiopsida. Four genera were recognized. The class was lowered in rank to the subclass Marattiidae in the 2009 classification of Mark W. Chase and James L. Reveal, and subsequent systems such as Christenhusz et al. (2011). The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (2016) classification retains this rank. In that system, Marattiidae is monotypic and has one order, Marattiales, one family, Marattiaceae, six genera, and an estimated 111 species."]}, {"page": "Disa (plant)", "response": ["In Genera Orchidacearum volume 2, Disa and Schizodium compose the subtribe Disinae of the tribe Diseae.Alec M.
