The plan was to break through both German lines and advance at least five miles, not least as Haig, Rawlinson and Gough all agreed that if they were to attack at all they needed to break beyond the slag heaps and colliery towers which dominated the battlefield. At this point Sir John French was still lobbying to conduct only an artillery diversion rather than a full attack, but First Army were still preparing to advance in case the French attacks further south caused the Germans to pull back. (Farrar-Hockley 1974, p. 166) Gough (22 August) proposed that 9th Scottish Division should \"rush\" the German positions on his left (Hohenzollern Redoubt, Fosse 8) just before dawn (4\u00a0am) after a barrage and gas attack, while the following night 7th Division would push through the Quarries to Citie St Elie.these planned advances are roughly north-east; together with Rawlinson's advance south-east the plan was to open a gap so that reserves could push due east to take Hulluch Haig recorded (1 September 1915) how \"active and energetic\" Gough and the artillery officer Noel Birch were, and insisted that Rawlinson (who proposed a limited stage-by-stage operation) also use gas for his initial attack.Lloyd 2006, pp. 49\u201353Sheffield 2005, p. 141 Gough would later (The Fifth Army p.\u00a0101) call gas \"a boomerang ally\"Lloyd 2006, p. 59 Gough later wrote that he had been dismayed at the lack of guns and ammunition. Neither Gough nor Rawlinson's corps had any reserve \u2013 in Gough's case only one brigade from each of his three divisions.Farrar-Hockley 1974, pp. 167\u2013168"]}, {"page": "Battle of Bazentin Ridge", "response": ["On 11 July, Rawlinson met again with the corps and divisional commanders, who wanted the original plan reinstated. Haig compromised with a scheme in which XV Corps, with reinforcements, would still attack first but XIII Corps would dig positions on the south slopes of the ridge from Longueval to Bazentin and send patrols forward, ready to attack, if it were feasible, to assist the XV Corps attack against both Bazentin woods and Bazentin le Petit. XV Corps would wheel east, to roll up the defences opposite XIII Corps which would then attack. Rawlinson contacted Haig again on 12 July and his Major-General General Staff (MGGS) Archibald Montgomery, contacted Launcelot Kiggell the BEF Chief of the General Staff, to make a final appeal. Haig gave way, provided that the supporting points were built by XIII Corps and the flanks were protected by garrisons in Mametz and Tr\u00f4nes woods. Most of Mametz Wood had already been captured and the fight for Tr\u00f4nes Wood continued. Haig was also reassured by Major-General Noel Birch the BEF MGRA (Major-General Royal Artillery) that the bombardment was succeeding, that German underground shelters in the second position would be shallower than those overrun on 1 July, that the British had gained artillery superiority and that a dawn attack would mean plenty of time for exploitation."]}, {"page": "Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode", "response": ["Chetwode's sister Florence was married to General Noel Birch."]}, {"page": "Giggleswick School", "response": ["*General Sir Noel Birch, GBE, KCMG, CB (1865\u20131939), soldier; ADC to the King "]}, {"page": "Birch gun", "response": ["Named after General Sir Noel Birch, who was Master General of Ordnance at the time, the Birch gun comprised a Vickers Medium Mark II tank chassis originally fitted with a QF 18-pounder (83.8\u00a0mm) gun.
