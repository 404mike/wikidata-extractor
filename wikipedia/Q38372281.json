On 19 December 2020, Loza made his return to a Woking shirt, during their 2\u20131 home victory over Dover Athletic in their FA Trophy third round tie, replacing Dave Tarpey in the 56th minute. Two months later, he went onto score his first goal for the club upon his return, netting in the 28th minute during their 2\u20130 away victory over Barnet. Just a week later, Loza scored the all important goal to propel the Cards into the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, latching onto team-mate, Charlie Cooper's header before driving a well-worked solo effort past Torquay United goalkeeper, Marcin Brzozowski in the 37th minute."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Football Conference", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Dave Tarpey"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 National League", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Dave Tarpey"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2017 || CF ||  || Dave Tarpey || Maidenhead United || Undisclosed || ", "|36||  || Dave Tarpey || FW || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2"]}]}}
