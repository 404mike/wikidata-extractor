Liddell put the ball in the net, but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already over. In the quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing Everton at Maine Road.

Further controversy followed in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1\u20130 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a penalty after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward George Robb's leg.

He began his career as a part-time professional in English non-league football with Cheshire County League side Ellesmere Port Town, playing as a winger. Manager Jimmy Harris switched him to centre forward after seeing the amount of goals he scored. A financial crisis at Ellesmere resulted in a move to Northern Premier League side Northwich Victoria. He was sold on to league rivals Wigan Athletic for \u00a3800 in summer 1970.

This tally included the opening goal in a 2\u20131 FA Cup second round victory over Peterborough United at Springfield Park. The win earned them a third round tie with Manchester City at Maine Road, which they lost 1\u20130. In a later interview he said that \"it was a delight to be supported by the wing play of Derek Temple and Graham Oates, their service was superb. They had the Beckham like ability to pick me out. I also had through balls provided from midfield by Gordon Milne and Jim Fleming, was it any wonder I scored 42 goals that season?\" He spent two seasons with Wigan, finishing as the club's top scorer on both occasions, scoring 28 goals in the 1971\u201372 campaign despite suffering with injuries.

Young goalkeeper Colin Withers had let in six goals in his first appearance as replacement for Johnny Schofield, who had fractured his skull, but made several saves to keep Birmingham from losing this match.
