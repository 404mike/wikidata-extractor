As a conscientious objector in the Second World War, he worked as a hospital orderly in Sheffield and Bristol. He was Curator of the Herbarium, Botany School, University of Cambridge 1949\u201373, Lecturer in Botany 1962\u201373, and for the ten years up until his retirement, 1973\u201383, Director of the University Botanic Garden in Cambridge, of which he wrote a history. He was a Research Fellow at St John's College, Cambridge 1948-51 and Fellow of King's College, Cambridge 1964\u201384.\nHe was the author of numerous books on plants and flowers, most notably the 1964 Atlas of the British Flora (with Franklyn Perring) and as a co-editor of Flora Europaea. He wrote two well-known books for the New Naturalist library, Wild Flowers (1954, co-written with John Gilmour) and Mountain Flowers (1956, with John Raven). He was much involved in the research and management of Wicken Fen.  After his retirement, he wrote a biography of Darwin's teacher and friend, John Stevens Henslow, Darwin's mentor (2001).\nWalters was a committed Christian who was much involved both in the local life of the Church of England (he was a churchwarden at Grantchester for many years) and in the application of Christian principles to national and social life: he was a Christian socialist and also a Christian pacifist, and as such was a leading member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation and also active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Naturalist", "response": ["|John Gilmour and Max Walters", "|John Raven and Max Walters", "|Max Walters"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Botanic Garden", "response": ["In 1921 the University appointed H.

According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera is related to the age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla."]}, {"page": "Stuart Max Walters", "response": ["#REDIRECT Max Walters"]}, {"page": "John Gilmour (botanist)", "response": ["On returning to Cambridge, Gilmour succeeded Humphrey Gilbert-Carter as director in 1951, he was an important force in the development of the Eastern Garden, once the Cory Fund monies became available, and the Cory Laboratory and glasshouses were constructed in 1957.

There, his biology master, CJ Sims, encouraged his interests. Following national service in the army, which he spent in Ireland, Malaya and India, Perring enrolled for a degree in natural sciences at Queens' College, Cambridge. He remained there to study for a PhD on the ecology and biogeography of plants of chalk grassland. At Cambridge that he developed a lifelong friendship with his supervisor, the biologist Max Walters, who was then curator of the university herbarium.", "In October 1954, Perring was given the job of assisting Max Walters who, himself, had been appointed by the BSBI to coordinate an ambitious five-year scheme to map the incidence of all vascular plant species across the British Isles; a project covering some 3,500 map squares, each measuring 10\u00a0km by 10\u00a0km. Perring designed different recording cards for each region of the country, and led field-recording trips to ensure the under-recorded parts of Britain were covered, sometimes travelling by train and bicycle to reach the remotest parts, and personally assisted Professor D. A. Webb with his efforts to cover the republic of Ireland. Perring also managed the inputting of data onto punched cards, and coordinated the then quite innovative application of a tabulator to print maps mechanically from punched cards. Perring subsequently became the director of the BSBI recording scheme in 1959."]}, {"page": "S. M.

Forming a friendship with the latter he was persuaded to spend the summer of 1949 in Uppsala and Helsinki universities where he was impressed by the mapping of the Scandinavian flora and returned to work with Walters on similar projects for the British Isles and used this method in his PhD thesis on Thyme.
