In addition to the movement of the Planters Association, workers in the Seychelles petitioned the government about their poor working conditions and tax structure, which led to some proposed reform by the governor at the time, Governor Sir Arthur Grimble.

Their ancestors, they said, had been white skinned and red haired and came from elsewhere, perhaps the West (possibly coinciding with the outward spread of Homo sapiens from Africa and elsewhere). As might be expected, they gave power to the natural forces and gave them names and godly characteristics (sun, moon, etc.) but believed in one spirit god, a bit similar to the god of Genesis, in that he/she seemed to have power over dark and light and so on, and was pretty much invisible.  They had a strong belief in behaving properly to their ancestors, and especially their parents, and had well-developed community rules for courtesy to others. Read A Pattern of Islands, by Arthur Grimble, who worked in these islands and on Banaba, for the Colonial Administration, from just before the First World War to the mid thirties, or thereabouts.  It is a remarkable, informative, funny and warm-hearted account of these people and their religion.  Other religions on the islands figure slightly, and there are remarkable stories of adventures, bravery, political machinations, etc. Probably out of print, but second hand copies are available I think, I have two, and the illustrations are delightful."]}, {"page": "Gilbert and Ellice Islands", "response": ["The Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony continued to be administered by a Resident Commissioner.

At Magdalene he was a great friend of Arthur Grimble, the future commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (Kiribati). Grimble's daughter, in a biography of her father, described the undergraduate Keable as devout, \"earnest, somewhat introspective\" and deeply literary. She records that he spent his university vacations on missionary work. He is known also to have taught in East Africa under YMCA auspices, and to have climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.", "Keable's developing attitudes and relationship with \"Betty\" disgusted his wife, Sybil, but as a devout Catholic she refused to divorce. This left Keable unable to marry Buck, and contributed to a growing sense on his part of alienation from English society. Eventually, in 1922, he legally separated from his wife. He took up the suggestion of former college friend Arthur Grimble, by then a colonial administrator in the Ellice Islands, that he visit the South Pacific, a fashionable destination for 1920s Europeans. To Keable the South Seas appeared to offer escape from the hypocrisies of British society, as well as furnishing a climate better suited to his never-hearty constitution. In 1922 Keable and Buck sailed aboard the Bendigo for the South Pacific via Australia, where Keable undertook a book tour, giving lectures in which he broadcast his new sexual ethics: that unmarried couples in love could have deeply moral relationships, while loveless spouses who stayed together for convention's sake were committing acts of deep immorality. His views scandalised the contemporary press, but Frank Weston noted in correspondence that Keable as a \"shipwrecked priest\" made quite a useful cautionary tale for novices.Cecil (1995) p.174"]}, {"page": "Robert Arundell", "response": ["Arundell was appointed Governor and Commander in Chief of the Windward Islands in succession to Sir Arthur Grimble and later Governor of Barbados and acting Governor-General of the West Indies.
