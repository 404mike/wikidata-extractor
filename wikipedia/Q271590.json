During the 50's, films like Los Olvidados, Rebel Without a Cause, Blackboard Jungle, and The Delinquents contained some of these plot elements. While the intention of these films wasn't necessarily to exploit these plot elements for profit, they can be seen as films that were influential for what other exploitation film producers would use as models to capitalize on to sell their \u201cteensploitation\u201d films. The word teensploitation first appeared in a show business publication in 1982 and was included in Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary for the first time in 2004. American International Pictures made films for the teenage market from the 1950s on. The company is responsible for numerous horror films and beach party films that also contain many of the plot elements of a \"teensploitation\" film. The Beatniks is a film with \"familiar tropes found in straight-up 1950s juvenile delinquency teensploitation.\" When the highly acclaimed A Clockwork Orange (1971) came out, its portrayal of juvenile delinquency was certainly more transgressive and graphic for what was normally seen in films up until that point. There are also films from the 70's and 80's like Over the Edge, Bad Boys, The Warriors, Made in Britain, Switchblade Sisters, Scum, Quadrophenia, Pixote, Out of the Blue, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, Rock 'n' Roll High School, The Wanderers, Foxes, Times Square, Smithereens, Little Darlings, Christiane F., Suburbia, and Class of 1984 that portrayed juvenile delinquency with either humorous rebellion or heavier gritty dramatic transgressions. Another dark teen film, River's Edge, which was inspired by the murder of Marcy Renee Conrad, and featuring early performances by Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves, Ione Skye, and a cameo appearance by Dennis Hopper, is a highly acclaimed instance where the film contained many of the \"teensploitation\" plot elements while also simultaneously grounding it further in a transgressive foundation. There are also Larry Clark films like Bully, Ken Park and Kids that are also well-known dark transgressive \"teensploitation\" films. Then there are \u201cteensploitation\u201d films from the 70's like Pretty Maids All in a Row, The Chicken Chronicles, The Cheerleaders, and The Pom Pom Girls that had more of a comedic approach to the \"teensploitation\" plot elements, while mostly fixating on the sexual plot elements. These kind of films from the 70's also helped contribute as an influences to the boom of teen sex comedies of the 80's while also simultaneously contributing to the boom of horror slasher films of the 80's. The fact that both sub-genres share \"teensploitation\" plot elements of teens involved with drugs, sex, or alcohol is the reason why they both go hand in hand. These plot elements with teens/young adults can be seen in many horror films such as A Bay of Blood, Black Christmas, Carrie, The Toxic Avenger, Hell Night, Class of Nuke 'Em High, The Burning, The Slumber Party Massacre, the Halloween franchise, the Friday the 13th franchise or the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.  The teen-adjacent sexploitation sub-genre was born out of teensploitation sub-genre. B-movie director, Roger Corman, was inspired to make many films that capitalized on the plot elements of sexy young adult female teachers, nurses, cheerleaders, flight attendants, etc. Such films like The Stewardesses (1969), Swedish Fly Girls (1971), The Swinging Cheerleaders (1974), Fly Me (1973), Blazing Stewardesses (1975), Stewardess School (1986), and The Bikini Carwash Company (1992) fit this description. With the success of Animal House (1978), its contribution to the \"teensploitation\" sub-genre was significant in the sense that it helped establish an inspirational foundation for the American teen sex comedies of the 80's and till the present. These films tend to fit within coming of age film genre and feature the trope of teens/young adults dealing with their sexuality shown through a ribald and comedic lens and tend to feature gratuitous female nudity. Some of the films like this are: Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), The Last American Virgin (1982), Private Lessons (1981), Heaven Help Us (1985), Spring Break (1983), Porky's (1981), Risky Business (1983), Surf II (1984), Squeeze Play!
