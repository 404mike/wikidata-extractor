Mark E. Smith of The Fall also found Machen an inspiration. Likewise, Current 93 have drawn on the mystical and occult leanings of Machen, with songs such as \"The Inmost Light\", which shares its title with Machen's story. Some artists on the Ghost Box Music label like Belbury Poly and The Focus Group draw heavily on Machen. It is an interest also shared by film directors like Mexican Rogelio A. Gonz\u00e1lez who made a successful version of \"The Islington Mystery\" as El Esqueleto de la se\u00f1ora Morales (1960), adapted by Luis Alcoriza, a frequent collaborator in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's classic films. This interest in Machen's works among filmmakers is also shared by Guillermo del Toro and Richard Stanley. Other notable figures with an enthusiasm for Machen have included Brocard Sewell, Barry Humphries, Stewart Lee and Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury."]}, {"page": "Daphne Oram", "response": ["* \"Spaceship UK: The Untold Story of the British Space Programme\" (2010), promotional 7\" split single with Belbury Poly"]}, {"page": "Chanctonbury Ring", "response": ["The album Chanctonbury Rings by Justin Hopper, Sharron Kraus and Belbury Poly, released on Ghost Box Records in 2019, contains prose and poetry detailing the geography and legends relating to the rings and its environs."]}, {"page": "Ghost Box Records", "response": ["Ghost Box is an independent, UK-based electronic music record label, launched in 2004 by graphic designer Julian House and producer Jim Jupp. Its roster includes artists such as Jupp's Belbury Poly, House's The Focus Group, and the Advisory Circle, as well as releases by Broadcast and John Foxx among others.", "Jupp and House have described the label as existing in an imagined or misremembered past.

In music journalism, Derrida's ideas were invoked by critic Ian Penman for his 1995 essay on the production style of Tricky's album Maxinquaye, though Penman did not use the phrase \"hauntology.\" In the mid-2000s, the word began to be more widely appropriated by writers and theorists such as Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher, who referred to the work of Philip Jeck, William Basinski, Burial, The Caretaker, and artists associated with the UK label Ghost Box as hauntology. Fisher attributed this renewed discussion of hauntology to the emergence of lo-fi musician Ariel Pink in the mid-2000s. In an 2006 article for The Wire, Reynolds identified Ghost Box's the Focus Group, Belbury Poly, the Advisory Circle as prominent in the trend, along with Broadcast, the Caretaker, and Mordant Music."]}]}}
