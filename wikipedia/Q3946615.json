At the beginning of the 17th century, the Tsardome of Moscow suffered a catastrophe, known as the Time of Troubles, and during the reign of Romanov dynasty, the enslavement of the peasantry intensified, which aggravated social struggles and led to numerous popular uprisings (such as the Stenka Razin one). The question of how far the folklore about Ivan IV can be considered to reflect popular sixteenth-century attitudes towards him, rather than a retrospective idealization, is highly debatable. The image created throughout Russian folklore is in a direct contrast to that which is typically painted of him and his rule by historians. As folklorist Jack V. Haney claims speaking about the stories of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great: \"Though the chief character is certainly a historical figure, the resemblance stops here, for there is nothing historical, or even very plausible, in most of these legends.\u201d.Haney, Jack V. \"An Introduction to the Russian Folktale.\" The Complete Russian Folktale. Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 1999. p. 9. ", "Primarily, throughout folktales, the tsar is typically described as an \u201cally and protector of the ordinary people against their common enemies, and especially the boyars\u201d.  One example of a folktale in which the tsar befriends the commoner can be found in Samuel Collins\u2019 recording. In this story, a friendship develops between a disguised Ivan and a thief. Eventually the thief asks the tsar if he wants to go robbing with him and the tsar agrees. After they had robbed from a few shops in the marketplace, the tsar wanted to test his new friend\u2019s loyalty and suggests that they rob the treasury. At this suggestion, the thief slaps the tsar saying that \u2018I\u2019ve been thieving for ages, but I\u2019ve never dreamt of robbing the tsar!\u201d. The story continues that the thief suggests that instead of robbing the tsar, the two should rob the boyars because \u201cthey get their money for nothing\u201d. For his faithfulness and respect for the tsar, Ivan rewards the young man by asking him to become his counselor."]}, {"page": "Samuel Collins", "response": ["*Samuel Collins (theologian) (1576\u20131651), English clergyman and academic", "*Samuel Collins (physician) (1619\u20131670), British doctor ", "*Samuel Collins (artist) (1735\u20131768), British artist", "*Samuel Collins (physicist) (1898\u20131984), physicist at MIT", "*Samuel Collins (politician) (1923\u20132012), American lawyer, jurist and politician from Maine"]}, {"page": "Peter Petreius", "response": ["Peersson's account of social life in Russia, Eastern Orthodoxy, popular culture and traditions was harsh and unforgiving.

Vasily III responded by referring to Maximilian as \"Maximiliano Dei gratia Electo Romanorum Caesare\", i.e., \"Roman Caesar\". Maximilian's letter was of great importance to Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great, when they wished to back up their titles of \"tsar\" and \"emperor\", respectively. Both monarchs demonstrated the letter to foreign ambassadors; Peter even referred to it when he proclaimed himself Emperor. However, the first Russian ruler to be formally crowned as Tsar of All Rus () was Ivan IV, until then known as Grand Prince of all the Russias. Some foreign ambassadors\u2014namely, Herberstein (in 1516 and 1525), Daniel Printz a Buchau (in 1576 and 1578) and Just Juel (in 1709)\u2014indicated that the word \"tsar\" should not be translated as \"emperor\", because it is applied by Russians to David, Solomon and other Biblical kings, who are simple reges.This objection may be used against translating \"Basileus\" as \"emperor\", too. Based on these accounts, the Popes repeatedly suggested to confer on the Russian monarchs the title of rex (\"king\"), if they only ally themselves with Vatican. Such a proposal was made for the last time in 1550, i.e., three years after Ivan IV had crowned himself tsar. As early as 1489, Ivan III declined the papal offer, declaring that his regal authority does not require anyone's confirmation. On the other hand, Jacques Margeret, a bodyguard of False Demetrius I, argues that the title of \"tsar\" is more honorable for Muscovites than \"kaiser\" or \"king\" exactly because it was God and not some earthly potentate who ordained to apply it to David, Solomon, and other kings of Israel.\"Et ainsi retiennent le nom de Zar comme plus autentique, duquel nom il pleut iadis \u00e0 Dieu d'honorer David, Salomon et autres regnans sur la maison de Iuda et Israel, disent-ils, et que ces mots Tsisar et Krol n'est que invention humaine, lequel nom quelqu'un s'est acquis par beaux faits d'armes\". Samuel Collins, a court physician to Tsar Alexis in 1659\u201366, styled the latter \"Great Emperor\", commenting that \"as for the word Czar, it has so near relation to Cesar... that it may well be granted to signifie Emperor. The Russians would have it to be an higher title than King, and yet they call David Czar, and our kings, Kirrols, probably from Carolus Quintus, whose history they have among them\".The Present State of Russia, in a Letter to a Friend at London.
