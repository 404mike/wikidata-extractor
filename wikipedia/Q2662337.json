His research interests were in the areas of star formation and structure, especially stellar magnetism and astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics. He was awarded both the Eddington Medal (1993) and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (for Astronomy, 2002). Following his retirement, he wrote several obituaries and biographical articles on physicists and astrophysicists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Sussex", "response": ["Other prominent academics on the staff of the university have included; Geoffrey Bennington; Homi K.

White dwarfs have an extremely small surface area to radiate this heat from, so they cool gradually, remaining hot for a long time. As a white dwarf cools, its surface temperature decreases, the radiation which it emits reddens, and its luminosity decreases. Since the white dwarf has no energy sink other than radiation, it follows that its cooling slows with time. The rate of cooling has been estimated for a carbon white dwarf of 0.59  with a hydrogen atmosphere. After initially taking approximately 1.5\u00a0billion years to cool to a surface temperature of 7,140\u00a0K, cooling approximately 500 more kelvins to 6,590\u00a0K takes around 0.3\u00a0billion years, but the next two steps of around 500\u00a0kelvins (to 6,030\u00a0K and 5,550\u00a0K) take first 0.4 and then 1.1\u00a0billion years."]}, {"page": "Van Maanen 2", "response": ["The high mass density of white dwarfs was demonstrated in 1925 by American astronomer Walter Adams when he measured the gravitational redshift of Sirius B as 21\u00a0km/s. In 1926, British astrophysicist Ralph Fowler used the new theory of quantum mechanics to show that these stars are supported by electron gas in a degenerate state. British astrophysicist Leon Mestel demonstrated in 1952 that the energy they emit is the surviving heat from bygone nuclear fusion. He showed that the latter no longer occurs within a white dwarf, and calculated the internal temperature of van Maanen 2 as . He gave a preliminary age estimate of 1011/A\u00a0years, where A is the mean atomic weight of the nuclei in the star."]}, {"page": "Donald Lynden-Bell", "response": ["He attended Marlborough College before being admitted to Clare College, Cambridge in 1953. After earning a distinction in the Mathematical Tripos, Lynden-Bell went on to doctoral studies in theoretical astronomy working with Leon Mestel, which he completed in 1960. In 1962, he published research with Olin Eggen and Allan Sandage arguing that the Milky Way originated through the dynamic collapse of a single large gas cloud. In 1969 he published his theory that quasars are powered by massive black holes accreting material. From counting dead quasars, he deduced that most massive galaxies have black holes at their centres."]}, {"page": "Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society", "response": ["| 2002 || Leon Mestel || J.
