Three years later the Addicks won the Division Three championship in 1929 and they remained at the Division Two level for four years. After relegation into the Third Division south at the end of the 1932\u201333 season the club appointed Jimmy Seed as manager and he oversaw the most successful period in Charlton's history either side of the Second World War. Seed, an ex-miner who had made a career as a footballer despite suffering the effects of poison gas in the First World War, remains the most successful manager in Charlton's history. He is commemorated in the name of a stand at the Valley. Seed was an innovative thinker about the game at a time when tactical formations were still relatively unsophisticated. He later recalled \"a simple scheme that enabled us to pull several matches out of the fire\" during the 1934\u201335 season: when the team was in trouble \"the centre-half was to forsake his defensive role and go up into the attack to add weight to the five forwards.\" The organisation Seed brought to the team proved effective and the Addicks gained successive promotions from the Third Division to the First Division between 1934 and 1936, becoming the first club to ever do so. Charlton finally secured promotion to the First Division by beating local rivals West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground, with their centre-half John Oakes playing on despite concussion and a broken nose.Colin Cameron, Home and Away with Chalton Athletic 1920\u20132004 (2004), p.69.", "Charlton reached the 1946 FA Cup Final, but lost 4\u20131 to Derby County at Wembley. Charlton's Bert Turner scored an own goal in the eightieth minute before equalising for the Addicks a minute later to take them into extra time, but they conceded three further goals in the extra period.Cameron, Home and Away with Charlton Athletic 1910\u20132004, p.112. When the full league programme resumed in 1946\u201347 Charlton could finish only 19th in the First Division, just above the relegation spots, but they made amends with their performance in the FA Cup, reaching the 1947 FA Cup Final. This time they were successful, beating Burnley 1\u20130, with Chris Duffy scoring the only goal of the day. In this period of renewed football attendances, Charlton became one of only thirteen English football teams to average over 40,000 as their attendance during a full season. The Valley was the largest football ground in the League, drawing crowds in excess of 70,000. However, in the 1950s little investment was made either for players or to The Valley, hampering the club's growth. In 1956, the then board undermined Jimmy Seed and asked for his resignation; Charlton were relegated the following year.", "| Jimmy Seed || May 1933\u00a0\u2013 September 1956 || Third Division champions (1935);Second Division runners-up (1936);First Division runners-up (1937);Football League War Cup co-winners (1944);FA Cup runners-up 1946;FA Cup winners 1947"]}, {"page": "March 25", "response": ["*  1885   \u2013 Jimmy Seed, English international footballer and manager (d. 1966)"]}, {"page": "Millwall F.C.", "response": ["|1958\u20131959|| Jimmy Seed"]}, {"page": "Consett", "response": ["*Jimmy Seed (born Blackhill, 1895\u20131966), professional footballer at Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur and Sheffield Wednesday, who then managed Charlton Athletic and Milwall"]}, {"page": "The Valley (London)", "response": ["===Jimmy Seed Stand===", "right|thumb|The Jimmy Seed Stand", "The Jimmy Seed (or South) Stand is the oldest part of the ground, and dates from the early 1980s.
