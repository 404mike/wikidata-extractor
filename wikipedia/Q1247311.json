The first eight series were shot in a studio, usually at BBC Television Centre, London, but certain episodes were recorded in Bristol or Manchester. Later episodes were recorded in front of a live studio audience. The format was a little like a music-hall variety show or 'end-of-the-pier' show.  The musical director was Jonathan Cohen on piano, with Spike Heatley on double bass and Alan Rushton on drums, often with accomplished guest musicians such as trombonist George Chisholm. In Australia the series aired on ABC at 4:30 after the Australian version of Play School. In New Zealand the series aired on TV One during the 1970s and 1980s.
