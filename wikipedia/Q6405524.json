Holdsworth targeted the play-offs for the 2012\u201313 season, though said that \"our aim is, first and foremost, staying in the division.\" Over the course of the season he also added Sonny Bradley (on loan), Danny Rose (on loan), Kieron Cadogan, Oliver Risser, Asa Hall (on loan), and Anthony McNamee to his squad. He led Aldershot to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup for the first time in the club's history.

Stevenage manager Gary Smith stated, while on trial, L\u00f3pez scored a hat-trick in a twenty-minute 8v8 match, and, although unfit, felt he showed enough over the two weeks to warrant a full-time contract. He made his debut two weeks later, on 15 September 2012, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute in the club's 2\u20132 home draw against Crewe Alexandra. In November 2012, having made just three substitute appearances for Stevenage, L\u00f3pez was loaned out to League Two club Aldershot Town on a one-month loan deal. He made his debut in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Bradford City on 10 November, coming on as a 69th-minute substitute. The following week, in his first starting appearance for Aldershot, L\u00f3pez scored in the club's 1\u20131 draw away to AFC Wimbledon. In Aldershot's next match three days later, on 20 November, L\u00f3pez scored the only goal of the game in a 1\u20130 away victory at Burton Albion; picking up Danny Hylton's flick-on before lashing the ball into the net from 20 yards. L\u00f3pez made it three goals in as many games four days later, when he scored a header from Kieron Cadogan's cross in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Port Vale. In December 2013, it was announced that L\u00f3pez' loan deal was extended for a further month, running until 26 January 2013. He scored a further three goals during the remainder of his loan spell, taking his goal tally to six goals in twelve games."]}, {"page": "Cadogan (surname)", "response": ["*Kieron Cadogan (born 1990), English footballer"]}]}}
