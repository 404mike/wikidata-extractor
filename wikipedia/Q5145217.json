Riesner's suggestion is however considered less likely, as all the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius' rule \u2013 namely Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio \u2013 count from AD\u00a014 \u2013 the year of Augustus' death. In addition, coin evidence shows that Tiberius started to reign in AD\u00a014.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 64", "All four Gospels agree to within about a day that the crucifixion was at the time of Passover, and all four Gospels agree that Jesus died a few hours before the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. he died before nightfall on a Friday (; ; ; ). In the official festival calendar of Judaea, as used by the priests of the temple, Passover time was specified precisely. The slaughtering of the lambs for Passover occurred between 3pm and 5pm on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan (corresponding to March/April). The Passover meal commenced at moonrise (necessarily a full moon) that evening, i.e., at the start of 15 Nisan (the Jewish day running from evening to evening) (; ). There is an apparent discrepancy of one day in the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion which has been the subject of considerable debate. In John's Gospel, it is stated that the day of Jesus' trial and execution was the day before Passover ( and ), Hence John places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan. Likewise the Apostle Paul, in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, implies Jesus died on a 14 Nisan (\"sacrificed as a Passover lamb\", ), and was resurrected on the Jewish festival of the first fruits, i.e. on a 16 Nisan ().Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 68\u201369 The correct interpretation of the Synoptics is less clear. Thus some scholars believe that all 4 Gospels place the crucifixion on Friday, 14 Nisan, others believe that according to the Synoptics it occurred on Friday, 15 Nisan. The problem that then has to be solved is that of determining in which of the years of the reign of Pontius Pilate (AD 26\u201336) the 14th and 15th Nisan fell on a Friday.", "In a paper published posthumously in 1733, Isaac Newton considered only the range AD\u00a031\u201336 and calculated that the Friday requirement is met only on Friday 3 April AD\u00a033, and 23 April AD\u00a034. The latter date can only have fallen on a Friday if an exceptional leap month had been introduced that year, but this was favoured by Newton.Newton, Isaac (1733). \"Of the Times of the Birth and Passion of Christ\", in Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John. Also at:   In the twentieth century, the standard view became that of J. K. Fotheringham, who in 1910 suggested 3\u00a0April AD\u00a033 on the basis of its coincidence with a lunar eclipse.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 45\u201348Fotheringham, J.K., 1910. \"On the smallest visible phase of the moon,\" Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 70, 527\u2013531;  \"Astronomical Evidence for the Date of the Crucifixion,\" Journal of Theological Studies (1910) 12, 120\u2013127'; \"The Evidence of Astronomy and Technical Chronology for the Date of the Crucifixion,\" Journal of Theological Studies (1934) 35, 146\u2013162. In 1933, Ant\u00f3nio Cabreira, following a similar method, arrived at the same date, as did, in the 1990s, Bradley E. Schaefer and J. P. Pratt.  Also according to Humphreys and Waddington, the lunar Jewish calendar leaves only two plausible dates within the reign of Pontius Pilate for Jesus' death, and both of these would have been a 14 Nisan as specified in the Gospel of John: Friday 7 April AD\u00a030, and Friday 3 April AD\u00a033.", "A more refined calculation takes into account that the Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation, following criticism that it is possible to establish the phase of the moon on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze.C. Philipp E. Nothaft, Dating the Passion: The Life of Jesus and the Emergence of Scientific Chronology (200\u20131600) page 25.E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus (Penguin, 1993) 285\u2013286. Including the possibility of a cloudy sky obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the refined calculation states that the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate's term of office, on 11 April AD\u00a027.  Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate's time, which is Newton's favoured date of 23 April AD\u00a034.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 53\u201358 Colin Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD\u00a027 and AD\u00a034 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with , and spring AD\u00a034 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul's timeline, confirming Friday 7 April AD\u00a030, and Friday 3 April AD\u00a033 as the two feasible crucifixion dates.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 63\u201366", "A lunar eclipse is potentially alluded to in Acts of the Apostles 2:14\u201321 (\"The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come\"), as pointed out by physicist Colin Humphreys and astronomer Graeme Waddington. There was in fact a lunar eclipse on 3 April AD\u00a033, a date which coincides with one of Newton's astronomically possible crucifixion dates (see above). Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that in ancient Jerusalem this eclipse would have been visible at moonrise at 6.20pm as a 20% partial eclipse (a full moon with a potentially red \"bite\" missing at the top left of the moon's disc). They propose that a large proportion of the Jewish population would have witnessed this eclipse as they would have been waiting for sunset in the west and immediately afterwards the rise of the anticipated full moon in the east as the prescribed signal to start their household Passover meals. Humphreys and Waddington therefore suggest a scenario where Jesus was crucified and died at 3pm on 3 April AD\u00a033, followed by a red partial lunar eclipse at moonrise at 6.20pm observed by the Jewish population, and that Peter recalls this event when preaching the resurrection to the Jews (Acts of the Apostles 2:14\u201321). Astronomer Bradley Schaefer agrees with the eclipse date but disputes that the eclipsed moon would have been visible by the time the moon had risen in Jerusalem.Schaefer, B. E. (July 1991).

Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event,David E. Garland, Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel (Smyth & Helwys Publishing,  1999) page 264. other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a solar eclipse, since this could not take place during the full moon at Passover,Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy by David H. Kelley, Eugene F. Milone 2011  pages 250\u2013251Astronomy: The Solar System and Beyond by Michael A. Seeds, Dana Backman, 2009  page 34 and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours.Meeus, J. (December 2003). The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse. Journal of the British Astronomical Association, 113(6), 343\u2013348. In 1983, astronomers Humphreys and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the lunar eclipse of AD\u00a033. This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as \"undefended\" and \"indefensible\". Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a khamsin, i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 84\u201385", "In the crucifixion narrative, the synoptic gospels stress that Jesus celebrated a Passover meal (Mark 14:12ff, Luke 22:15) before his crucifixion, which contrasts sharply with the independent gospel of John who is explicit that the official \"Jewish\" Passover (John 11:55) started at nightfall after Jesus' death. In his 2011 book, Colin Humphreys proposes a resolution to this apparent discrepancy by positing that Jesus' \"synoptic\" Passover meal in fact took place two days before John's \"Jewish\" Passover because the former is calculated by the putative original Jewish lunar calendar (itself based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar putatively introduced to the Israelites by Moses in the 13th century BC, and still used today by the Samaritans). The official \"Jewish\" Passover in contrast was determined by a Jewish calendar reckoning which had been modified during the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BC. This modified Jewish calendar is in use among most Jews today. One basic difference lies in the determination of the first day of the new month: while the Samaritans use the calculated (because by definition invisible) new moon, mainstream Jews use the first observation of the thin crescent of the waxing moon which is on average 30 hours later. The other basic difference lies in the fact that the Samaritan calendar uses a sunrise-to-sunrise day, while the official Jewish calendar uses a sunset-to-sunset day. Due to these differences, the Samaritan Passover is normally one day earlier than the Jewish Passover (and in some years two or more days earlier). The crucifixion year of Jesus can then be calculated by asking the question in which of the two astronomically possible years of AD\u00a030 and AD\u00a033 is there a time gap between the last supper and the crucifixion which is compatible with the gospel timeline of Jesus' last 6 days. The astronomical calculations show that a hypothetical AD\u00a030 date would require an incompatible Monday Last Supper, while AD\u00a033 offers a compatible Last Supper on Wednesday, 1 April AD\u00a033, followed by a compatible crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD\u00a033.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 164", "Given these assumptions he argues that the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD\u00a033 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be an anachronism.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 37 The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's and Paul's narratives that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD\u00a033 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 192\u2013195", "Colin Humphreys' widely publicised \"double passover\" astronomical analysis, published in 2011 and outlined above, places the time of death of Jesus at 3pm on 3 April AD\u00a033 and claims to reconcile the Gospel accounts for the \"six days\" leading up to the crucifixion. His solution is that the synoptic gospels and John's gospel use two distinct calendars (the official Jewish lunar calendar, and what is today the Samaritan lunar calendar, the latter used in Jesus' day also by the Essenes of Qumran and the Zealots). Humphrey's proposal was preceded in 1957 by the work of Annie JaubertLa date de la c\u00e8ne, Gabalda, Paris who suggested that Jesus held his Last Supper at Passover time according to the Qumran solar calendar. Humphreys rejects Jaubert's conclusion by demonstrating that the Qumran solar reckoning would always place Jesus' Last Supper after the Jewish Passover, in contradiction to all four gospels. Instead, Humphreys points out that the Essene community at Qumran additionally used a lunar calendar, itself evidently based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar. Humphreys suggests that the reason why his two-calendar solution had not been discovered earlier is (a) widespread scholarly ignorance of the existence of the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar (used alongside the well-known Egyptian administrative solar calendar, and presumably the basis for the 13th-century BC Jewish lunar calendar), and (b) the fact that the modern surviving small community of Samaritans did not reveal the calculations underlying their lunar calendar (preserving the Egyptian reckoning) to outsiders until the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Holy Wednesday", "response": ["Although the consensus of modern scholarship is that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, a growing body of commentators claim the traditional Holy Week calendar is inaccurate and Jesus was crucified on Wednesday, not Friday.
