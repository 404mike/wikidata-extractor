During this time a single, \"Damage Done/Watch/Home of the Hit-men\", was recorded and released. The band name was influenced by Robert Altman's film McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), which featured the Leonard Cohen song \"Sisters of Mercy\" from his album Songs of Leonard Cohen, \"because [calling ourselves] the Captains of Industry wouldn't have been as funny\".", "Eldritch's associates approached Gary Marx, the co-founding member, to write tracks for a new studio album.

On the first single, \"Damage Done/Watch/Home of the Hit-men\", Eldritch played the drums, a task he was later relieved of by a series of drum machines referred to as Doktor Avalanche, allowing him instead to focus on his vocal performance. Over the years, nine members have left the group, several of them citing conflicts with the frontman as a reason for their departure. These former members include Patricia Morrison, who claimed she had been paid an average of \u00a3300 per month; and Wayne Hussey, with whom Eldritch had a personal feud which contributed to heavy criticism of both by the music press during the 1980s. Hussey formed a breakaway band called The Mission as a result of this conflict.", "In 1995 Eldritch interviewed David Bowie and Leonard Cohen for the German edition of Rolling Stone magazine. He also contributed articles on computers to German magazines. That year, he briefly rejuvenated his working relationship with erstwhile Sisters of Mercy guitarist Gary Marx. Marx wrote an album's worth of backing tracks, to which Eldritch could contribute lyrics for release as a new studio album. Eldritch eventually backed out of the project and Marx released the tracks over a decade later as a solo album."]}, {"page": "First and Last and Always", "response": ["The band was founded in 1980 by Andrew Eldritch and Gary Marx in Leeds. Up to 1983, the band produced five singles and two EPs, which were released on the band's own indie label Merciful Release and were distributed independently as well. As the band became increasingly successful and featured regularly in the UK Indie Chart, a first studio album was announced in 1983 for the following year. Eldritch estimated the production costs at \u00a340,000, a sum which exceeded the financial capabilities of an indie band. Around the same time talks with interested record labels began. Eldritch, who handled management and business affairs of the band, negotiated with several record companies early in the new year and finally signed a satisfactory contract with WEA Records. Merciful Release opened an office in London and founded its own publishing company Candelmaesse Limited, as well, which licensed the future song material to the publisher of RCA Records, RCA Music Limited.", "At Strawberry Recording Studios in Stockport, the Sisters of Mercy recorded their first single in March 1984 for WEA (\"Body and Soul\"), which was composed and produced by Eldritch himself and which was released on 4 June 1984. \"Body and Soul\" peaked at  46 on the UK Singles Chart. From 2 May to 6 June, the band toured the UK and Europe and tried out a new Gary Marx composition which he later used in Ghost Dance. Recommended by WEA Records, Cure producer Dave Allen saw the band in Amsterdam (2 June 1984) and later received a telegram by Andrew Eldritch which said: \"The Sisters say yes to Dave Allen\". After the end of the tour, they began to prepare themselves for the album recordings, but first they entered Maida Vale Studios on 19 June to record a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1. The session was broadcast on 13 July when the Sisters of Mercy were already in the recording studio.", "After intense songwriting sessions, Gary Marx entered Parkside Studios, \"a tiny studio in a rehearsal complex off Armley Road where I'd been with Wayne to record some new demos with him singing.\" The recordings were engineered by Steve Allen. Eldritch was enthusiastic about the new material, and played some instrumental demos to Melody Maker journalist Adam Sweeting: \"I think this stuff's gonna be incredible, like nothing we've ever done before\".", "At the end of June 1984, the Sisters of Mercy went with producer Dave Allen into the Strawberry Recording Studios in Stockport, near Manchester, for five weeks to record their first studio album. Studio costs were \u00a3500 a day and \u00a33,250 a week. Eldritch spent the whole five weeks inside the studio and, according to Dave Allen, used large amounts of amphetamine on a daily basis. In Stockport, backing tracks and vocals were to be recorded. Additional vocals, overdubs and the final mix were planned for August at Genetic Studios. The finished album was to be released in the third week of October 1984. The band immediately started to record, with Hussey and Marx often providing guide vocals with their own lyrics which later showed up on bootlegs. Both Hussey and Marx later used some of these lyrics for their own bands, The Mission and Ghost Dance. An early recording of \"First and Last and Always\", which, according to Gary Marx, was \"previously called 'The Scottish One'\", was \"completed pretty early on\". Marx sang an early draft of the later Ghost Dance lyric of \"When I Call\", which mentioned the name of a friend of the band's from Hamburg; Marianne.", "On \"Nine While Nine\", which, according to Marx, was \"recorded at the same time\" and \"had the working title 'Child of Light\", Gary Marx sang a guide vocal which he reused later for the Ghost Dance song \"A Deeper Blue\". The title of this song is derived from Yorkshire dialect where \"while\" is used to mean \"until\". \"Black Planet\" exists in the form of an early version with a Wayne Hussey lyric which he later used for the Mission songs \"Dance on Glass\" and \"Naked and Savage\". Additional songs which were left unused were the later Mission song \"Garden of Delight\" and later Ghost Dance song \"Yesterday Again\". Eldritch later sang his own version of \"Garden of Delight\" which remained unused as well: \"There are a few bootlegs in existence of me trying to sing Wayne's words, and you can hear that I'm not convinced by them. I can't breathe any meaning into them.\"Andrew Eldritch TV interview (ZTV, Sweden 1993) \"The guy didn't have a clue \u2013 he'd just string buzz words together.\"", "Recordings were delayed, to the frustration of the band as Eldritch was still working on lyrics. Gary Marx: \"He'd got far too caught up in the business and had lost his edge as a writer. We wasted weeks at a time in the studio, waiting for him to come up with a handful of lyrics. It was very painful and very expensive.\" A notable exception was \"Marian\". Eldritch, inspired by Gary Marx's original lyrics to \"First and Last and Always\", wrote new words to a Wayne Hussey composition which contained a few passages sung in German. \"'Marian' is a very special song; it's not like any of the other songs. I wrote it in ten minutes, usually the lyrics take me up to half a year.\" The vocal takes proved to be time-consumingly elaborate. Marx said, \"After each session Andy would say, 'But is it epic?', and we'd go, 'Yeah Andy, it's great!' And he'd go back and do it again. Andy's a complete perfectionist.\" He added, \"We could write and record a double album in the time it took him to get the headphone mix to his liking.\"", "According to Dave Allen \"Tones\", \"Spit on Your Grave\", \"Evil Come Evil Go\" and \"Down to E.....\" are working titles for known songs. \"Amphetamine Logic\", according to Gary Marx, had the working title \"Horned One Stabs\", which indicates that this song was not recorded at Strawberry but at later sessions. In early August 1984, the band flew to the US to play two concerts in New York.", "After the US gigs, the band went into Genetic Studios near Reading with producer Dave Allen as planned to complete the album with engineer Tim Baldwin. But the sessions at Genetic Studios dissolved, according to Gary Marx, into \"madness of Eldritch walking into walls between vocal takes and us generally losing the plot. [Baldwin] seemed to remember it fondly enough.\" Weakened by continuous amphetamine use, insomnia, malnutrition and hypoglycaemia, Eldritch collapsed in the studio one night. Marx: \"He was completely exhausted; hallucinating. Despite this, part of him still wanted to carry on, although the other part knew that he had to stop because he was so ill.\" Eldritch: \"I enjoy it so much, being strung out for a very long time. I'm told you can't do it for that long.\" Eldritch was rushed to the nearest hospital where he had to stay for a while because of heart complications and reduced general and nutritional condition. In time for two festival appearances in Germany in early September 1984, Eldritch was released from hospital, but the band couldn't meet the scheduled release date of the album. During an interview in Ahlen on 8 September, Eldritch said the release had been postponed to the beginning of the next year.", "After the end of the tour, the band returned to Genetic Studios without bassist Craig Adams or producer Dave Allen to mix the album. On this occasion two new songs were recorded, \"Blood Money\" and \"Bury Me Deep\", which were produced by Eldritch and were intended as B-sides for the next single, \"No Time to Cry\". At the end of 1984, Eldritch also produced the mini-album Clash of Dreams by Salvation at Strawberry Recording Studios in Stockport, which was intended for a March 1985 release on his Merciful Release label. The album was shelved. After the Christmas break, the band spent January and February 1985 with preparations for the album release, which again had been postponed to March. The artwork was completed and delivered, and various tapes with different mixes to pick circulated at the WEA offices. Additionally, the band negotiated the release of a live video on PolyGram which was to be filmed on Gary Marx's birthday on 18 June 1985 at the Royal Albert Hall. Around that time, lead guitarist and band co-founder Gary Marx decided to leave the group. \"My relationship to all three of them was completely shattered.\" \"As a songwriter it was a frustrating time in The Sisters. I wrote a lot of songs but they weren't used.\" It had been presumed that Hussey should switch to keyboards, a step which Hussey would never have tolerated.", "For the album sessions the band had acquired a new drum machine, an Oberheim DMX. The album lyrics were all written by Andrew Eldritch, who said his writing \"owes more to collage editing in film\". Their content, with various references to drugs and separation, mirror Eldritch's condition at the time: \"I was so shot when I wrote the lyrics on the album that there's no distancing of persona at all.\" Gary Marx: \"When we were making [the album] Andrew was effectively splitting with his long-term girlfriend and I was close to leaving the band. [These] two things led to a number of references in the lyrics, which seemed to cover his farewells to us both.\" Eldritch later confirmed that the lyrics of \"Walk Away\" were directed to Gary Marx: \"I thought one of them in particular might have found it a bit relevant.\" Gary Marx: \"'Walk Away' may or may not be about me; I don't care because I don't particularly like the song. The one lyric which always bugs me is the line from 'Some Kind of Stranger' which says 'careful lingers undecided at the door', which I definitely took as a shot at me.\"", "On 8 March 1985, the single \"No Time to Cry\" was released, reached No. 63 on the UK chart. To coincide with the album release, a UK tour began on 9 March. On 11 March, WEA Records Ltd. released the album in the UK to positive press reactions. On 1 April, Marx played his last concert with The Sisters of Mercy, followed by a TV appearance the day after, during which the band played live in the studio versions of \"First and Last and Always\" and \"Marian\". The remaining trio, with Wayne Hussey shouldering all guitar parts, started another tour through Europe and the US on 12 April, which continued till 7 June. A second TV appearance for German TV show , during which the band mimed to \"No Time to Cry\", was broadcast on 15 April 1985. The Sisters of Mercy played their final concert as planned on 18 June 1985 at the Royal Albert Hall. Gary Marx, who was announced to take part, didn't show up.
