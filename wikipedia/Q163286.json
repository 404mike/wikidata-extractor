Grant achieved international success after appearing in Mike Newell's romantic comedy film Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), whereupon he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the British Academy Film Award for Best Actor. Grant became widely known in cinema, as a charming, vulnerable, witty romantic lead. After the success of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant established himself as a leading man with satirical comic talent. Grant starred in the romantic comedies Notting Hill (1999), Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), Two Weeks Notice (2002), Love Actually (2003) and Music and Lyrics (2007).Grant began to take against-type parts, starting with multiple roles in The Wachowskis' epic science fiction drama film, Cloud Atlas (2012).

He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal. In a career spanning more than 35 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling but rather a career that developed by happenstance.
