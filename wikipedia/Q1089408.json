During his early years at RHC he did research on thermionic emissions and gaseous ions. Over this time he became increasingly involved in college administration. He moved the physics department from the main college building to a purpose-built building in 1926, later known as the Horton Laboratory, with the first floor housing botany. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of London from 1939 to 1945. Since 1993 the building has housed Social Policy and Social Science entirely and physics now occupies the Tolansky and Wilson Laboratories.
