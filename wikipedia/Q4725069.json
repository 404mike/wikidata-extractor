Mostafa (born Ali Faisal Mostafa Bin Abdullatif on 25 September 1981) is a British-Emirati filmmaker, director and producer who is credited as the director of the first Emirati feature-film City of Life (2009). He is a graduate of London Film School.\nAccording to Mostafa, the inspiration for producing City of Life came because \u201cI was tired of people comparing Dubai to a Disneyland. Most of them take one look at the glitzy buildings and assume it\u2019s an artificial place. My film has none of that. It has real people with real problems. Like any other city in the world, my film shows both the positives and the negatives.\" Mostafa faced initial controversy when a couple cinemas refused to showcase his movie who they claimed portrayed Dubai in a negative light. He however squashed the rumours, saying that with his film, he hoped to change the global perception of his hometown and put it on par with cities such as London and New York City which also face \"real problems.\" According to data produced by Italia Film International the movie ranked second in the local box office and successfully made over 500,000 dirhams in its first weekend; there were reports that makers were deciding to show the film at the Cannes Film Festival in 2010.Mostafa has been branded as  \"Best Emirati Filmmaker\" in the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), won the 'Young Filmmaker of the Year' award at the Digital Studio Awards 2010, and Variety magazine quoted that he has proven to be the Gulf\u2019s first director of international standing.\nWhile expanding his activities into brand ambassadorships, in 2011 Mostafa was asked to develop the first ever short series \u2013 Classified \u2013 to be broadcast online only and developed in the Middle East as part of his association with Land Rover.\nMostafa\u2019s second feature From A to B opened the Abu Dhabi Film Festival in October 2014, a first for an Emirati film, challenging stereotypical perceptions of Middle Eastern culture through a story of three best friends who take a road trip from Abu Dhabi to Beirut.\nMostafa\u2019s latest feature The Worthy, a collaboration between Imagination and Hollywood Producers Peter Safran and Steven Schneider, premiered at the BFA London Film Festival in October 2016, and received a gala premiere at the Dubai Film Festival in December 2016. A thriller set in the dystopian future where water is scarce, it was released on 23 February 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tropfest Arabia", "response": ["The jury consisted of a panel of Arab filmmakers including Emirati director Ali Mustafa; Kuwaiti actor, Khaled Amin; Syrian actor, Bassel Khayat; Tunisian actress , Dorra Zarrouk;  and Jordanian producer Rula Nasser."]}, {"page": "Ali Mustafa", "response": ["Ali Mustafa may refer to:", "*Ali Mustafa (cricketer), Pakistani cricketer", "*Ali Mustafa (footballer), Bruneian football ex-player and coach", "*Ali Mustafa (journalist) (1984\u20132014), Pakistani-Canadian photographer and journalist", "*Ali Mustafa Baghdady (1922\u20132005), Egyptian Air Force commander", "*Abu Ali Mustafa (1938\u20132001), Secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"]}]}}
