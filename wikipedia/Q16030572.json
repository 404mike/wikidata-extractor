Elers was born at Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury Square and grew up living in Filkins Hall. As a child, Elers found he had a greater love for his aunt than his parents as he spent much of his time with the former. At the age of eight, he attended a school in Chiswick for a time until he fell ill with measles and the head, a Mr. Crawford, died of dropsy. Elers then became a half-boarder at a school in Soho Square, overseen by Dr. Barrow.
