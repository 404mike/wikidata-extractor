After another singer, Shane Fenton, took over as Alvin Stardust, Shelley continued to write and produce hit songs for him, including \"Jealous Mind\" and \"You You You\".

During the early 1970s, however, he acquired a new persona, Alvin Stardust, cashing in on the glam rock bandwagon. Alvin Stardust was clearly a reference to Ziggy Stardust, a David Bowie character based on the \"C-list\" rocker Vince Taylor. The Alvin Stardust character looked remarkably like Taylor with sideburns and black leather outfit. His new name was given to him by Peter Shelley, the co-founder (with Michael Levy) of Magnet Records. Shelley originated the persona of Alvin Stardust, writing, recording and singing the first Stardust single, \"My Coo Ca Choo\", in 1973. Shelley, however, had no interest in performing live or making public appearances, so even as \"My Coo Ca Choo\" was climbing the charts, he was on the lookout for someone to take over the role of Alvin Stardust.
