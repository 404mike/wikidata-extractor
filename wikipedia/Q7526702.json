He was married in 1880 to Catherine, daughter of David Davis of Aberdare; the couple had one daughter.He was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Radnorshire in 1892. Edwards was a determined Liberal and a supporter of the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales, of which he was a member. In 1894, Edwards joined with David Lloyd George, David Alfred Thomas and Herbert Lewis in resigning the Liberal Whip in protest at the delay of the Government of Lord Rosebery in introducing a Welsh Disestablishment measure. He was a relative of A. G. Edwards, Bishop of St Asaph and first Archbishop of Wales.Defeated in 1895, Edwards was to play no part in the struggle to unite Welsh Liberalism under the auspices of Cymru Fydd. Edwards appears to have been viewed as under the 'baleful' influence of David Alfred Thomas by Lloyd George and Herbert Lewis. \nIn 1898, he was High Sheriff of the county. \nIn 1900, Edwards fought Radnorshire on a platform of opposition to the Boer War and returned to parliament.\nHe was created baronet of Knighton in the County of Radnor on 25 July 1907.Edwards published a volume of Welsh poetry entitled 'Translations from the Welsh' in 1913. He did not stand in 1918, the Radnorshire Constituency having been amalgamated with Brecon.\nHe served as Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Radnorshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank Edwards (British politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Francis Edwards, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "1850s in Wales", "response": ["**28 April \u2014 Sir Francis Edwards, 1st Baronet, Liberal politician (died 1927)"]}, {"page": "1852 in Wales", "response": ["*28 April \u2013 Sir Francis Edwards, 1st Baronet, Liberal politician (died 1927)"]}, {"page": "Edwards baronets", "response": ["*Sir Francis Edwards, 1st Baronet (1852\u20131927)"]}, {"page": "Francis Edwards", "response": ["*Sir Francis Edwards, 1st Baronet (1852\u20131927), British Liberal Party politician"]}, {"page": "Oliver Green-Wilkinson", "response": ["Green-Wilkinson was born on 7 May 1913 in the Rectory at Aston Tirrold, the second of five children of Rev.
