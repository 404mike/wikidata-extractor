He made more than 150 appearances in the Football League for several clubs.\nStyles was born in Liverpool, and joined home-town club Everton on leaving school in 1965. He won representative honours for England at schoolboy and youth level. He was unable to make himself a regular part of Everton's first team, making only 23 league appearances in seven years at the club. In February 1974, together with Howard Kendall, he moved from Everton to Birmingham City in part-exchange for Bob Latchford, the whole deal valuing Latchford at \u00a3350,000 which was at the time a British transfer record. At Birmingham, facing competition from Garry Pendrey and others, he failed to establish himself as first choice at left back. In 1978, he moved to Peterborough United where he spent one season, followed by one season at Portsmouth, after which he joined the coaching staff at the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bob Latchford", "response": ["Latchford was born in Kings Heath, Birmingham.

At Everton, Latchford was the top scorer for six successive seasons.

He was capped twice at youth level by England. The 17-year-old Rathbone made his first-team debut on 31 August 1976 in a League Cup defeat to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, and had a poor game as he later admitted that \"I was at fault for both goals\" and \"had absolutely no confidence at all\" due to what he deemed to be an intimidating atmosphere in the Birmingham City dressing room. He was so low on confidence that he tried to avoid manager Willie Bell so as to avoid training with or playing for the first team. He also recalled how he was never able to effectively pass the ball, either in training or in matches, to star forward Trevor Francis due to the nerves he felt in the presence of his childhood hero.
