Media speculation prior to the announcement of the franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan\u2014who would act as inaugural club chairman\u2014also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to make it into the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.", "At the time of the formation of the new league in 2004, the club was owned by Spirits Sports and Leisure Group. The club announced its search for a star player under the league's allowance for one star player outside of the $1.5\u00a0million salary cap, insisting that the player should not look at the position as a retirement fund. Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players Ante Milicic and Simon Colosimo, and announced that he may sign more than the three under-20 players required by league rules. Early concerns for the club focussed on concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology company Toshiba and a cash injection from local businessman John Singleton, the club's financial worries were eased. McKinna was keen to sign local player Damien Brown of Bateau Bay, formerly of the Newcastle Jets. In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was \"over the moon\", Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman Lyall Gorman was pleased that a local had become a \"foundation player\" and part of Brown's role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area. By early December 2004, the club had created a steady foundation of player signings and began negotiations with former Perth Glory striker Nik Mrdja, signing him later in the month as its star attacker. Mrjda was one of the most prominent players in the last season of the National Soccer League, scoring the final goal to secure Perth Glory's finals win. The club's management was reluctant to sign a star player outside of the $1.5\u00a0million salary cap, stipulating that they \"would have to contribute on the pitch and get people to come to the ground.\"", "===Lawrie McKinna era (2004\u20132010)===", "|align=left| Lawrie McKinna"]}, {"page": "North West Sydney Spirit FC", "response": ["*  Lawrie McKinna"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 A-League", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Hyundai A-League Coach of the Year||Lawrie McKinna (Central Coast Mariners)"]}, {"page": "Blacktown City FC", "response": ["*  Lawrie McKinna (Central Coast Mariners manager)"]}, {"page": "John Hutchinson (footballer, born 1979)", "response": ["In 2011, Hutchinson was loaned to Chinese Super League side Chengdu Blades, under former Mariners coach Lawrie McKinna and alongside fellow Mariner Adam Kwasnik.
