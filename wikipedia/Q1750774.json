Jackie Swanson, who played the recurring role of Woody's girlfriend and eventual wife \"Kelly Gaines-Boyd\", appeared in 24 episodes from 1989 to 1993. The character is as equally dim and naive\u2014but ultimately as sweet-natured\u2014as Woody."]}, {"page": "July 10", "response": ["*2015 \u2013 Roger Rees, Welsh-American actor and director (b. 1944)"]}, {"page": "May 5", "response": ["*  1944   \u2013 Roger Rees, Welsh-American actor and director (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "The Hound of the Baskervilles", "response": ["The Hound of the Baskervilles has been adapted for radio for the BBC by Bert Coules on two occasions.
