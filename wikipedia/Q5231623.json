He also retained his interest in medical matters, and in June 1719 took a medical doctorate in Cambridge, enabling him to join the London College of Physicians in 1720. In October 1720 he was one of the physicians who conducted an autopsy of a deceased elephant in Hans Sloane's Chelsea garden. In March 1722 he gave the Goulstonian Lecture at the Royal College theatre; his topic was the human spleen. He published his lectures as On the Spleen in 1722, appending to it his \"Essay Towards the Anatomy of the Elephant\".
