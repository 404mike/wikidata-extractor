Schuberth first entered Formula One in 2000 using the QF1 helmet worn by Nick Heidfeld, after designing a safer helmet in response to Michael Schumacher's accident at the 1999 British Grand Prix. The helmet, which was lighter than others at the time and featured filters to remove fumes and dust from the air, was taken by more drivers including then World Champion Michael Schumacher, and was gradually developed into the current RF1 model. Currently, Schuberth helmets are used by Max Verstappen, Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Perez, Mick Schumacher, Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Felipe Massa,  Nico Rosberg, and Susie Wolff. Schuberth designs all current helmets in their own wind tunnel facilities, to enable maximum aerodynamic efficiency, and employed Michael Schumacher as a consultant for motorcycle helmet design. NASCAR drivers Danica Patrick and Jimmie Johnson also use Schuberth helmets, theirs being variations on the designs used for F1 drivers.http://blog.schuberth.com/en/2012/04/27/danica-patrick-chooses-schuberth-sf1-as-she-moves-to-nascar/"]}, {"page": "List of family relations in auto racing", "response": ["|Susie Wolff"]}]}}
