Through the 1920s he built a reputation as a formidable match play golfer, in an era when many professionals made more money from \"challenge\" matches against fellow pros, or wealthy amateurs, than from tournament golf.\nCompston was born in Wolverhampton.\nFamously, in 1928, Compston - who had won the British PGA Matchplay Championship in 1925 and 1927 - faced Walter Hagen, who had won the American PGA Championship at match play in the previous four years, in a 72-hole challenge match, and defeated the American 18 & 17. However, when the two met again shortly afterward at The Open Championship at Royal St George's, Hagen prevailed, with Compston placing third.\nIn 1930, Compston nearly derailed Bobby Jones's bid for the Grand Slam at Hoylake - his third round of 68 took the lead from Jones, but inexplicably his form deserted him in the final round, and Compston shot 82 to finish down the field.\nCompston played in the Ryder Cup in 1927, 1929 and 1931, defeating Gene Sarazen on one occasion.\nCompston also became notable as perhaps Britain's first \"celebrity\" professional golfer, becoming a coach to the future Edward VIII. He was the professional at the Wentworth Club from 1945 to 1948, and later at the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ryder Cup", "response": ["The British team was: Ted Ray (Captain), Aubrey Boomer, Archie Compston, George Duncan, George Gadd, Arthur Havers, Herbert Jolly, Abe Mitchell, Fred Robson and Ernest Whitcombe.

In a stiff breeze local professional Willie Nolan led after the first day with a course record 72. On the second day Nolan faded after an 83 and the lead was taken by Henry Cotton on 146 with Jack Smith a shot behind. The cut was 165 and exactly 60 players qualified, including 6 amateurs. Conditions were very poor on the final day with the refreshment and press tents blown down and rain falling in torrents. Jack Smith had an excellent 77 in the morning and with Henry Cotton taking 86, Smith had an eight-shot lead over Cotton and Archie Compston. Smith, however, went to pieces and had a final round of 91 and was overtaken by Cotton, who took 81. George Duncan, starting the final round 14 shots behind, scored 74 and finished with a total of 312, beating Smith by three and Cotton by one. Duncan's score of 74 was remarkable in that it was only two strokes over the new course record, on a day when his 74 and Smith's 77 in the morning were the only two rounds under 80 on the final day. Duncan took the Championship Gold Medal and the first prize of \u00a3150.

The 1929 championship was played again at Portmarnock and resulted in a three-way tie on 309, just 3 strokes better than Duncan's score there in 1927. There was a 36-hole playoff the following day. Abe Mitchell and Archie Compston were level after the first round on 75 with Len Holland five behind. Mitchell scored another 75 in the afternoon to win by two strokes from Compston and ten from Holland. Charles Whitcombe dominated the 1930 tournament, winning by 8 strokes from defending champion Abe Mitchell. Whitcombe led by four after the first two rounds and full away further on the final day. the 1931 championship was won by a relative unknown, Bob Kenyon, who won by two after a final round 70.
