Through the 1920s he built a reputation as a formidable match play golfer, in an era when many professionals made more money from \"challenge\" matches against fellow pros, or wealthy amateurs, than from tournament golf.\nCompston was born in Wolverhampton.\nFamously, in 1928, Compston - who had won the British PGA Matchplay Championship in 1925 and 1927 - faced Walter Hagen, who had won the American PGA Championship at match play in the previous four years, in a 72-hole challenge match, and defeated the American 18 & 17. However, when the two met again shortly afterward at The Open Championship at Royal St George's, Hagen prevailed, with Compston placing third.\nIn 1930, Compston nearly derailed Bobby Jones's bid for the Grand Slam at Hoylake - his third round of 68 took the lead from Jones, but inexplicably his form deserted him in the final round, and Compston shot 82 to finish down the field.\nCompston played in the Ryder Cup in 1927, 1929 and 1931, defeating Gene Sarazen on one occasion.\nCompston also became notable as perhaps Britain's first \"celebrity\" professional golfer, becoming a coach to the future Edward VIII. He was the professional at the Wentworth Club from 1945 to 1948, and later at the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda.", "link_mentions": {}}}
