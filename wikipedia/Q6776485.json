Formed in 1993, they were popularly labelled as a Britpop band and often drew comparisons to the Smiths because of their Morrissey-esque lead singer, Martin Rossiter. Gene's music was influenced by the Jam, the Smiths, the Style Council and the Clash.", "Wanting to continue together in a band, Steve Mason and James recruited bass player Kevin Miles, who had a long association with the band. After seeing Watford-based Welshman Martin Rossiter cross the floor of a club, Mason approached him and they began to talk. Their meeting ended with Rossiter handing out his business card (\"Martin Rossiter: Soothsayer to the Stars\") and Mason asking Rossiter if he would like to audition with the band. Rossiter appeared on Spin's last demos as \"Martin T. Falls\" (a nod to the Mancunian band The Fall) shortly before the decision was made to adopt the name Gene.", "1998 served as a fallow year for the band, used for writing new material as well as a few low-key shows and events such as Radio 1's Sound City. In fact, the most newsworthy article about Gene during that year was of Martin Rossiter's 'drastic' change in image. Gone were the suit jackets with white shirts and the floppy side-parted hair, in favour of the mod-like Fred Perry polo shirts, jeans and a very short haircut. The new look was to be reflective of the band's rockier forthcoming studio LP, Revelations. On their return from relative wilderness, it appeared that Gene had lost a lot of their prestige during their year out of the limelight, and were no longer the golden boys of the indie scene.  First off the LP, released in February 1999, was a Jam-like political single called \"As Good As it Gets\", which entered the charts at number 23 to lukewarm reviews. Revelations was released that March to very mixed reviews; the NME awarded it 5/10, concluding that the album was \"pretty thin on the ground\"."]}, {"page": "The Blue Room (EP)", "response": ["AllMusic journalist MacKenzie Wilson considered The Blue Room to be \"well-crafted with lush harmonies\", noting that \"Martin's harking vocals reflect common dream pop melodies similar to Gene frontman Martin Rossiter\", and singled out \"Such a Rush\" as being \"outstanding\"."]}, {"page": "If I Was Your Girlfriend", "response": ["*\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" was covered by Martin Rossiter, released in 2012 on a cover EP called The Defenestration of Prince and Others."]}, {"page": "Watford Grammar School for Boys", "response": ["* Martin Rossiter (1970\u2013 ), ex lead singer of 90s Brit Pop band Gene"]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Martin Rossiter, singer with the band Gene, lives in Brighton"]}, {"page": "List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes", "response": ["|Jonathan Ross and Martin Rossiter (Gene) [9]"]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: R", "response": ["| Martin Rossiter"]}, {"page": "List of bisexual people (N\u2013S)", "response": ["| | Martin Rossiter"]}, {"page": "List of songs about child abuse", "response": ["* \"Three Points on a Compass\", by Martin Rossiter"]}, {"page": "Olympian (album)", "response": ["* Martin Rossiter - Vocals, Keyboards"]}, {"page": "The Defenestration of St Martin", "response": ["The Defenestration of St. Martin is the debut album by former Gene lead singer Martin Rossiter, released in November 2012 through Pledge Music.
