These included 31 and 50 (his maiden first-class half-century) against Yorkshire,\nas well as the highest score of his short List A career, 36 in a Refuge Assurance League game against Sussex.The following summer, 1989, was the best of Bent's Worcestershire career. Although he had only a single (and unsuccessful) one-day outing, he played 13 first-class games and scored 530 runs at an average of just over 24. This was helped by a career-best innings of 144 against Kent at the end of July, in which he shared century partnerships with both Chris Tolley and Graeme Hick.Bent never again played such a significant part in a season: he played no more List A games, and made only seven first-class appearances in 1990 and eight in his final year of 1991. He hit one more century, scoring exactly 100 not out in an opening partnership of 225 with captain Tim Curtis against Lancashire at Stanley Park in August 1991.After the end of his Worcestershire career, Bent played minor counties cricket for Herefordshire in 1992, and unlike in his first-class days proved quite effective as a bowler, taking three or four wickets in an innings on a number of occasions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "(A)live in Concert 97", "response": ["*Paul Bent\u00a0\u2013 Tour Engineer"]}, {"page": "Live at Montreaux Jazz Festival 2001", "response": ["*Tour Engineer: Paul Bent"]}, {"page": "Bent (surname)", "response": ["* Paul Bent (born 1965), former English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Bent, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Bent"]}]}}
