Fry was a major driving force behind new legislation to improve the treatment of prisoners, especially female inmates, and as such has been called the 'Angel of Prisons'.\nShe was instrumental in the 1823 Gaols Act which mandated sex-segregation of prisons and female warders for female inmates to protect them from sexual exploitation. Fry kept extensive diaries in which the need to protect female prisoners from rape and sexual exploitation is explicit.She was supported in her efforts by Queen Victoria and by both Emperor Alexander I and Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and was in correspondence with both, their wives and the Empress Mother.  In commemoration of her achievements she was depicted on the Bank of England \u00a35 note, in circulation between 2002 and 2016.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 21", "response": ["*1780 \u2013 Elizabeth Fry, English prison reformer, philanthropist and Quaker (d. 1845)"]}, {"page": "October 12", "response": ["*1845 \u2013 Elizabeth Fry, English prison reformer, Quaker and philanthropist (b. 1780)", "**Edith Cavell and Elizabeth Fry (Church of England)"]}, {"page": "1823", "response": ["* July 10 \u2013 The Gaols Act is passed by Parliament of the United Kingdom, based on the prison reform campaign of Elizabeth Fry."]}, {"page": "1845", "response": ["* October 12 \u2013 Elizabeth Fry, British humanitarian (b. 1780)"]}, {"page": "1780", "response": ["* May 21 \u2013 Elizabeth Fry, British humanitarian (d. 1845)"]}, {"page": "Norfolk", "response": ["* Elizabeth Fry, prominent 19th century Quaker prison reformer pictured on the Bank of England \u00a35 note, born and raised in Norwich"]}, {"page": "Newgate Prison", "response": ["During the early 19th century, the prison attracted the attention of the social reformer Elizabeth Fry.

It was while working with his family that Dix traveled to St. Croix, where she first witnessed slavery at first hand, though her experience did not dispose her sympathies toward abolitionism. In 1831, she established a model school for girls in Boston, operating it until 1836, when she suffered a breakdown. Dix was encouraged to take a trip to Europe to improve her health. While she was there she met British social reformers who inspired her. These reformers included Elizabeth Fry, Samuel Tuke and William Rathbone with whom she lived during the duration of her trip in Europe. In hopes of a cure, in 1836 she traveled to England, where she met the Rathbone family. During her trip in Europe and her stay with the Rathbone family, Dorothea's grandmother passed away and left her a \"sizable estate, along with her royalties\" which allowed her to live comfortably for the remainder of her life. It was also during this trip that she came across an institution in Turkey, which she used as a model institution despite its conditions being just like other facilities. They invited her as a guest to Greenbank, their ancestral mansion in Liverpool. The Rathbones were Quakers and prominent social reformers. At Greenbank, Dix met their circle of men and women who believed that government should play a direct, active role in social welfare. She was also introduced to the reform movement for care of the mentally ill in Great Britain, known as lunacy reform. Its members were making deep investigations of madhouses and asylums, publishing their studies in reports to the House of Commons."]}, {"page": "Regency era", "response": [";1813: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was published.
