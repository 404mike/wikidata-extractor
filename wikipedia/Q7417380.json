While in prison, he was tortured and forced to make a televised confession in which he detailed the methods and as to which he and his fellow prisoners committed the crime. He was later granted clemency and returned to the UK, as a result of intense negotiations by Charles, Prince of Wales and a possible prisoner exchange in the U.S.\nMitchell says the bombings were perpetrated by \"Islamic extremists\" and that he and others charged were victims of a cover-up conspiracy by Saudi authorities.  Along with Mark Hollingsworth, he wrote Saudi Babylon: Torture, Corruption and Cover-Up Inside the House of Saud.\nOthers charged in connection with the death of Christopher Rodway include Les Walker, Ron Jones, Mike Sedlak, Raf Schyvens, and Bill Sampson.Mitchell, Walker, Jones, and Sampson, with the backing of Amnesty International, The Redress Trust, and Interights, sought the right in the British court system to sue Saudi Arabia for their torture.

In June 2006, a decision handed down at the Law Lords overturned the earlier ruling of the Court of Appeal.
