Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy \"I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round\", before disbanding.

I think you can only start finding yourself when you write your own material.\" By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice."]}, {"page": "Everybody Loves a Lover", "response": ["Besides concurrent covers for the UK market by both the Undertakers and Cliff Bennett, the Shirelles' version of \"Everybody Loves a Lover\" was also the template for the Sandie Shaw version recorded for her 1965 Sandie album, and also the Peaches and Herb version recorded for their 1967 album For Your Love.

By the end of 1962, the group were one of the most successful in the area, and placed second in the Mersey Beat annual poll, behind the Beatles but ahead of Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Searchers, and other groups who later became nationally and internationally renowned.  Lee Curtis and the All-Stars were signed by Decca Records, and released two singles in early 1963, \"Little Girl\" and \"Let's Stomp\".  However, neither made the charts, and in mid 1963 the rest of the band decided to split from Curtis to form The Original All-Stars.
