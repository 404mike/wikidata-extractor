The revived organization's first and founding members included Mary Antoinette \"Toni\" Perry, Josephine Hull, Gertrude Lawrence, Theresa Helburn, and Vera Allen; with Louise Heims Beck serving as the organization's first Vice President. They began fundraising and organizing clothing donations to send overseas to the British people and to provide relief for European refugees in America. The organization initially worked from two rooms located inside 30 Rockefeller Plaza. In its first few months of operations they successfully lobbied businesses to donate supplies, with donations to the British people from American businessman including 1,000 coats for women and children and 4,000 lbs of coffee in addition to medical supplies and other clothing and materials. Others, encompassing both women and men, soon joined the ATW, including Tallulah Bankhead, Ray Bolger, Clare Booth, Ilka Chase, Lynn Fontaine, Helen Hayes, Burgess Meredith, Cornelia Otis Skinner, and Clifton Webb. In 1941, with the entry of the United States into the war, the organization shifted its focus to the American war effort."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1984 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|Clare Booth"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1988 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|Clare Booth", "|Clare Booth", "|Clare Booth"]}, {"page": "Gisela Uhlen", "response": ["* 1976: Frauen in New York von Clare Booth"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 1984 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's downhill", "response": ["| - || 26 ||align=left| Clare Booth || align=left| || DNF ||  -"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's downhill", "response": ["| 25 || 29 ||align=left| Clare Booth || align=left| || 1:32.50 ||  +6.64"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's super-G", "response": ["| 35 || 36 ||align=left| Clare Booth || align=left| || 1:26.27 ||  +7.24"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's combined", "response": ["| - ||align=left| Clare Booth || align=left| || 1:20.58 || 63.58 || DNF || - || - || - || -"]}, {"page": "Ellen Liiger", "response": ["Throughout her many years on the stages of Estonia, she appeared in numerous stage productions of works by such international authors and playwrights as: George Bernard Shaw, Brecht and Weill, Moli\u00e8re, Maxim Gorky, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Mikhail Lermontov, Istv\u00e1n \u00d6rk\u00e9ny, Nikolai Gogol, Max Halbe, Clare Booth, and Erich K\u00e4stner, among others.
