Four teams dominated Welsh national selection at the time, and out of the 15-man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan Griffiths of Llanelli had been selected. The match was played in Swansea, and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd, with gate receipts of only \u00a3120 recorded.

His debut was against England on 3 January at Rodney Parade and Wales lost 7-3, though Pearson scored a try for Wales. This try made Pearson the youngest player to score a try for Wales at 18 years and 238 days until overtaken by Tom Prydie in 2010. Pearson's try also made him the youngest player to score a try on his Wales debut until George North surpassed the record in 2010. Pearson was dropped after the 1892 Championship and didn't regain his Wales place until the end of 1894 tournament, an unusual situation as during 1892/93 season, he scored a record 40 tries for Cardiff, a club record.Godwin (1984), pg 32. Pearson played fairly frequently for Wales through to 1898, but in 1903, with his international career supposedly far behind him, he was recalled to captain Wales against England. Pearson had already scored a try when he was forced to leave the field after a particularly heavy tackle from Harry Gamlin. His replacement, Jehoida Hodges scored a hat-trick of tries.

At the time Biggs was 18 years and 49 days old, making him the youngest Wales international, a record that would last for more than a century before being broken by Tom Prydie in 2010.Griffiths (1987), p. 4:5. The New Zealanders were the first touring team from the Southern Hemisphere and brought with them a reputation for over-vigorous play. Biggs himself was described by the press as \"palpably nervous\" before the kick-off, though many of the backs appeared withdrawn, apart from William Stadden and James Webb appearing calm.Billot (1972), p.17 Not only did Biggs have the M\u0101ori opposition to contend with, the Swansea crowd were also hostile towards their own team, as they felt the Swansea backs should have been selected instead. Biggs, as an inexperienced new cap from rivals Cardiff, was picked out by the crowd as one of those players unworthy of his place and was heckled. Nonetheless, the Welsh team were victorious, with tries from Thomas, Towers and Hannan and a single conversion from Webb. A week later on 29 December, Biggs faced the same tourists, this time as part of the Cardiff team. Biggs had been disappointing in his international debut, but regained his form on the pitch at the Cardiff Arms Park.Billot (1972), p 21 Within 90 seconds of the start of the match, Biggs scored a \"sparkling try\". Biggs should have scored again, but dropped the ball after crossing the line in the slippery conditions.

With six more tries to his name by March, Fenby attracted the attention of London Irish, who beat off interest from other clubs to bring him back to the English Premiership on a three-year contract from the 2013\u201314 season. Fenby's tries in 2012\u201313 helped the Scarlets to fourth in the Pro 12 table and a place in the championship play-offs; however, defeat to Ulster in the semi-finals brought the Scarlets' season to an end. His performances also led to speculation that a Wales call-up might have been on the cards for the team's summer tour against Japan, but he was eventually left out in favour of younger alternatives in Dafydd Howells, Liam Williams, Harry Robinson and Tom Prydie."]}, {"page": "Wales at the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Tom Prydie"]}, {"page": "2010 June rugby union tests", "response": ["| ||11||Tom Prydie", "| ||11|| Tom Prydie", "| ||11|| Tom Prydie"]}, {"page": "George North", "response": ["After an impressive start to the 2010 season, in October 2010, he was selected to the 33-man squad for the Autumn international series.
