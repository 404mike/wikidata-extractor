He studied music at the Royal Academy of Music, Royal Holloway and Nottingham universities, and composition with Hans Werner Henze in London and Italy.A number of his key works are literary-inspired, and much of his music is for strings, notable exceptions being the early wind quintet 'In Xanadu' from 1992 (after Coleridge), 'Porphyria's Lover' (1999) for flute and piano (after Browning), and the clarinet and piano '...That Which Echoes in Eternity' (after lines from Dante's Divine Comedy). Of his two string quartets, the first is subtitled 'I Have the Serpent Brought' after lines by John Donne from his poem 'Twicknam Garden', and the second (2006) commissioned by the Chilingirian Quartet (Levon Chilingirian), subtitled 'After Cromer' since much of the thematic material is derived from the English hymn of the same name. Other chamber works for strings include two piano trios \u2013 the first, more substantial one premiered in Vienna in 2004, and the latter, an evocative single-movement piece (2007) entitled 'Softly, in the Dusk...' after the poem 'Piano' by D. H. Lawrence \u2013 a Cello Sonata commissioned by Raphael Wallfisch and John York (2005) and the Quintet for Clarinet and Strings (2002). Larger scale works include the Piano Concerto (2010), which is subtitled 'The Moving Finger Writes'; a quotation from FitzGerald's translation of The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, and the Violin Concerto (2015) commissioned by the French violinist Philippe Graffin. There are also songs and various smaller instrumental works.\nPeter Fribbins is also Director of Music at Middlesex University, London (since 2004) and Artistic Director of the long-established series of Sunday London Chamber Music Society Concerts, formerly at Conway Hall and resident at Kings Place since 2008.\nHis concert work is often linked with a group of British composers called 'Music Haven', not a school as such, but a collection of composers (c.f. the French 'Les Six' or the British 'Manchester School', from the early and late twentieth-century respectively), mostly London-based and with broadly similar interests and aesthetic outlook, reflecting sympathies for British masters such as Britten and Tippett and the music of the First Viennese School, especially Haydn and Beethoven, as well as the Scandinavian influences of Sibelius and Nielsen. The group includes James Francis Brown, Northern Irish-born Alan Mills, Matthew Taylor, John Hawkins, Geoff Palmer, and more peripherally two older British composers, David Matthews and by association, John McCabe CBE. The set of piano pieces 'Seven Haydn Fantasies for John McCabe' \u2013 each composed by a different composer and published in 2009 on the occasion of the latter's 70th birthday \u2013 is in many ways typical of the group's work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wembley", "response": ["* Composer Peter Fribbins was born, and grew up, in Wembley."]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Peter Fribbins || 1969 ||  || British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "List of string quartet composers", "response": ["*Peter Fribbins (born 1969): Two string quartets: String Quartet No. 1 I have the serpent brought (1990\u201398 rev. 2002\u201304); String Quartet No. 2 After Cromer (2006).Composer (2009).
