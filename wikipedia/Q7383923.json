He was under contract at Birmingham City, Barnet and Japanese side Machida Zelvia. He joined the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain in summer 2009. From there he was sent out to Worcester City, Jerez Industrial, Doncaster Rovers, and Oxford United to gain first team experience. In June 2011 he signed with Port Vale via Hyde (partners of the Hoddle Academy). He left Port Vale in April 2013 after falling out with the club's management, and signed with Newport County for the 2013\u201314 season. After over 18 months out of the game, he signed with Sutton United in February 2016, and was an influential presence in midfield, helping the club to win promotion as champions of National League South at the end of the 2015\u201316 season, he left the club in December 2016 and joined Eastleigh for a brief spell four months later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["After losing his job at Bramall Lane, he was immediately offered a three-year contract at former club Port Vale. He signed the contract within days, saying it was time to \"finish the job I started\". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals \u2013 both scoring and conceding \u2013 Adams decided to give his players \"a kick up the backside\" by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Rob Kozluk. He stepped down as a director on 5 November, the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale, after former director Stan Meigh withdrew the \u00a350,000 sponsorship he had provided to keep Adams on the board of directors.", "With the club still unable to sign new players due to administration in May 2012, Adams offered contracts to 16 of his players for the 2012\u201313 campaign. However, he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins, Anthony Griffith, Sean Rigg, and captain and top-scorer Marc Richards; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere, leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch. He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion, finishing as the division's top-scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign."]}, {"page": "Cadbury Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Several former youth players at Cadbury Athletic have gone on to play professional football, including Ryan Burge, Demarai Gray, Corey O'Keeffe and Daniel Sturridge.Birmingham City: Who is Corey O\u2019Keeffe?

His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson, a midfielder and striker respectively. Adams' notoriously tough pre-season training regime began in earnest, though the players reported that they had come to expect the hard work come summertime and Adams himself was pleased with the condition his players began the pre-season in. Adams built on his new youth policy with the signatures of Sheffield United duo Kingsley James and Phil Roe; as well as Walsall defender Clayton McDonald, and left-back Mike Green. The club undertook a tour of North America for the first time in its history, where they recorded victories over USL Premier Development League sides North Sound SeaWolves, Tacoma Tide, Kitsap Pumas, and Victoria Highlanders. Following this tour, Justin Richards made a surprise exit to Burton Albion \u2013 this left namesake Marc as the club's senior player at the relatively young age of 29, in one of the club's youngest ever squads. To replace the departing striker former loanee \u2013 and self-confirmed Vale supporter \u2013 Tom Pope was signed from Rotherham United.", "In addition to off-the-field troubles in January, Adams also had to deal with an injury crisis to his small squad; already missing Ryan Burge and Lewis Haldane with long-term injuries, the treatment room also welcomed Marc Richards, Rob Taylor, Gareth Owen, Tom Pope and Lee Collins. Vale suffered four consecutive defeats, before managing to turn things around by the end of the month with 1\u20130 wins over Rotherham United and Plymouth Argyle. On 14 February, midfielders Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall joined the club on non-contract terms. However the treatment room grew more busy, as Adam Yates and Tom Pope picked up injuries requiring several weeks of rest. The club expected to receive a boost when Trinidad and Tobago international Chris Birchall returned from the Los Angeles Galaxy to play for the club on a month-by-month basis; however the club were hit by a transfer embargo by the Football League on 25 February for failing to pay a bill. Nevertheless performances on the pitch were solid, and Vale entered the Crewe derby having won four and drawn one of their last five games. The derby finished honours even again at 1\u20131, with a late header from Byron Moore cancelling out the own goal scored by Crewe skipper David Artell. A 2\u20131 home defeat by Barnet on 10 March ended Vale's run of eight game unbeaten; combined with a ten-point deduction for entering administration, the club slipped from 9th to 14th in the space of 24 hours. Promising young defender Lee Collins was the first the leave the club post-administration, joining Championship side Barnsley on a loan deal worth \u00a350,000 to the Vale on 15 March. The drama continued in the game against Shrewsbury Town on 27 March, as the match was abandoned after 64 minutes due to a fire caused by the failure of the floodlights at the New Meadow. With the season drawing to a close, Adams began developing his squad for the following season, and announced that he had 'reluctantly' released defender Charlie Raglan, without giving him his first team debut. He offered contracts to all but three players: Chris Martin, Phil Roe, and Paul Marshall; he also placed Burge on the transfer list. Aside from Lee Collins, the first player to reject a contract with Vale to move elsewhere was Anthony Griffith, who signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. The first out-of-contract players to pledge their futures to Port Vale were Rob Taylor (two years), Lewis Haldane (six months), Ben Williamson (one year), and Sam Johnson (one year). Days later it was announced that Sean Rigg had signed with Oxford United, whilst Clayton McDonald confirmed that he would accept Vale's offer of a new one-year deal. However the biggest blow to fan's hopes of promotion came when it was announced that talismanic top-scorer Marc Richards had signed a two-year deal with relegated League One side Chesterfield. June began with John McCombe and Tom Pope both agreeing to sign new deals with the club. The only player to reject the club's offer of a new contract despite not signing a contract elsewhere was goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson; he eventually ended up at Burton Albion.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||10||align=\"left\"| Ryan Burge", "|||Ryan Burge"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The team got off to a solid start in August, recording wins over a poor Barnet side and a much more resilient Morecambe. They lost away at Accrington Stanley despite having 56% possession and 12 attempts on goal. They continued their form into September, as 14 points from a possible 18 left them sitting second in the table. Only a bizarre own goal from Brian Saah won them a point at home to Torquay United, before Tom Pope hit four against former club Rotherham United in a 6\u20132 victory; the win over Steve Evans's big spending \"Millers\" sent a message to the rest of the division that Vale were genuine promotion candidates. They then came from behind to win away at Plymouth Argyle, before putting a highly impressive Fleetwood Town to the sword with a 5\u20132 away victory. A top-of-table clash with Gillingham at Vale Park ended the \"Valiants\" impressive run, as the visitors claimed a 2\u20130 victory with a professional performance. Having named the same first eleven for nine successive games, Adams introduced Rob Taylor and Ryan Burge at the expense of central midfielders Sam Morsy and Chris Shuker, and was rewarded with a 1\u20130 win over high-flying Bradford City in front of over 11,000 spectators at Valley Parade. Micky Adams was named as Manager of the Month and Pope was named as Player of the Month.", "Oxford beat Vale 2\u20131 on 2 March, ending Vale's five-month unbeaten run on the road. Adams then tried to add some steel to his midfield by re-signing tough-tackling Anthony Griffith from Leyton Orient. League Cup finalists Bradford then came to Burslem, and left with a point after the first goalless draw at Vale Park of the season. With the gap between Vale and play-offs getting ever more slender, Southend then successfully defended a two-goal lead at half-time to beat Vale 2\u20131. Adams admitted that \"Promotion seems a million miles away with the way we're playing.\" Things then went from bad to worse at Bristol Rovers, with former Stoke player Ryan Brunt giving the \"Gas\" a 2\u20130 win whilst Ashley Vincent suffered a season-ending injury. Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Full-back Adam Yates later said this low-point motivated the players to pull together to prove wrong fans that had barracked Adams. Burge was suspended for two weeks after refusing to apologize for making veiled criticism of the club on Twitter. Vale then put a poor York side to the sword with goals from Myrie-Williams and Hughes. Cheltenham Town proved a much sterner challenge, but Vale recovered from 2\u20131 down to win a crucial match 3\u20132, with Tom Pope hitting his third hat-trick of the season.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||23||align=\"left\"| Ryan Burge", "|7||MF||||23||Ryan Burge||2||0||0||1||3", "|23||||MF||Ryan Burge||6||0||1||0||0||0||1||0||8||0", "|||Ryan Burge"]}]}}
