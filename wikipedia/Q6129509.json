His obituary notice in The Phytologist states he worked there in the printing and engraving business of \"Mr. Allen\". Under the legislation of the time, a printer had to apply for the licensing of a new press; and in April 1845 Josiah Allen of Birmingham, brother of James Baylis Allen, submitted an application witnessed by \"Geo. Luxford\" for a recent press. (Business partners could and did act as witnesses.) Luxford was elected an associate of the Linnean Society in 1836."]}]}}
