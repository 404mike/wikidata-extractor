Hocking's victory in Coventry was certainly an achievement as the constituency was seen as a fairly strong Labour Party area and indeed he remains to this day the only Conservative to have won the seat. He became a close friend of Denys Bullard, another Conservative MP with agricultural interests whose seat depended on a small and hard-won majority in a difficult constituency. Hocking's most memorable contribution to the politics of the day was when he appeared on BBC Television following the Profumo affair. Hocking was asked if Harold Macmillan was finished politically; Hocking compared Macmillan to a pheasant once it has been shot. \"It may have been shot,\" he said, \"but it is still going to run and run.\" Having replaced Elaine Burton at the 1959 general election with the song \"High Hopes\" as his anthem, Hocking lost the 1964 election to William Wilson."]}, {"page": "Denys Gradwell Bullard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Denys Bullard"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Denys Bullard; MP for South West Norfolk (1951\u20131955) and King's Lynn (1959\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "List of people from King's Lynn", "response": ["*Denys Bullard (1912\u20131994), Conservative politician and agriculturalist"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Denys Bullard \u2014 Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Denys Bullard"]}]}}
