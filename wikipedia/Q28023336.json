They entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1885\u201386, were founder members of the Northern League in 1889, turned professional in 1908 and joined the North Eastern League, which they won in 1913 and 1921. The latter win preceded election to the Football League as members of its newly formed Third Division North. Runners-up in their first season, Darlington were Northern Section champions three years later, thus winning promotion to the Second Division. Their 15th-place finish in 1926 remains their best League performance, and they were relegated back to the Third Division the following year. After 68 years of continuous membership, they were relegated from the Football League in 1988\u201389. Having made an immediate return as Conference champions, they remained in the League until 2010, when they again dropped into the Conference. After Darlington failed to exit administration in a manner acceptable to the Football Association, that body treated it as a new club, required it to change its name (to Darlington 1883), and placed its team in the Northern League, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012\u201313 season. Five years later, the FA approved the club's request to resume its traditional name.The club's first team have competed in numerous nationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in between 1 and 24 such matches, either as a member of the starting eleven or as a substitute, are listed below. Each player's details include the duration of his Darlington career, his typical playing position while with the club, and the number of games played and goals scored in domestic league matches and in all senior competitive matches. Where applicable, the list also includes the national team for which the player was selected, and the number of senior international caps he won.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ryan Scott", "response": ["Ryan Scott may refer to: ", "* Ryan Scott (cricketer)", "* Ryan Scott (footballer, born 1976), English football goalkeeper", "* Ryan Scott (soccer, born 1995), Australian football goalkeeper", "* Ryan Scott (sprinter) (born 1987), English sprinter", "* Ryan Scott (wheelchair rugby) (born 1982), Australian Paralympic wheelchair rugby player"]}]}}
