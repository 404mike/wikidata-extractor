He played for Wycombe Wanderers, Luton Town, Newcastle United, Fulham Norwich City, Stoke City, Sheffield United, Tulsa Roughnecks, Blackburn Rovers and York City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["The club remained in the playoff hunt until New Year, and then achieved one of the best results in its history when beating Crystal Palace 1\u20130 in the FA Cup Third round \u2013 the first time that Hartlepool had beaten a top division side. However, this would prove to be the end of the club's success for several years. It was revealed shortly after the cup win that the club were in financial difficulties. To make ends meet, a number of players were released or sold, and the club set an unenviable record by going 1,227 minutes without scoring. During this run Murray was sacked and replaced by Viv Busby. The club eventually escaped relegation, finishing 16th."]}, {"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["He moved into management with York as player-manager ahead of 1982\u201383, accepting the position on 12 May 1982. He described the set up at Bootham Crescent on his arrival as a \"shambles\", as training consisted entirely of running and was devoid of any actual coaching. He signed veteran players Roger Jones (goalkeeper), Alan Hay (defender) and Ricky Sbragia (defender), as well as young Stoke defender Chris Evans, which including Smith himself meant a complete change in the club's back line. He brought in striker Viv Busby as a player-coach. He then made  26-year-old striker Keith Walwyn his priority, and encouraged Walwyn to use his natural physical presence to become a greater threat in front of goal and unlock his potential. Smith retired from playing after steering York to a seventh-place in 1982\u201383, in which he made 36 appearances and scored 4 goals. He signed Sheffield United's John MacPhail on a free transfer as a replacement for himself.", "In May 1987, Smith was appointed manager at Sunderland, who had just been relegated into the Third Division for the first time in their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than \u00a320,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay \u00a310,000. Smith agreed to a \u00a340,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra \u00a310,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for \u00a380,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987\u201388. A 7\u20130 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with 93 points."]}, {"page": "Tulsa Roughnecks (1978\u20131984)", "response": ["* Viv Busby (1981\u201382)"]}, {"page": "Keith Houchen", "response": ["He left Vale Park on a free transfer in June 1993 and turned down a move to Cyprus outfit AC Omonia to return to former club Hartlepool United. Injury meant he did not play for the man who signed him, Viv Busby, and instead he made his second debut for the club under John MacPhail. Houchen went on to score eight goals in 37 games as Hartlepool were relegated into the bottom tier of the Football League in 1993\u201394, finishing a massive 17 points behind Blackpool, who were one point above the relegation zone. MacPhail was quickly sacked and replaced by David McCreery; MacPhail blamed the fact that the club was sometimes unable to pay the player's wages as a reason for poor results on the field. Houchen was a coach at the club, but quickly fell out with temporary 'advisory coach' Sandy Clark. Houchen scored a hat-trick against Bury, though was later sent off in the match for allegedly swearing at referee Kevin Lynch; at the time of the incident Houchen was receiving treatment for knee ligament damage which would keep him out of action for six weeks. McCreery resigned on 20 April 1995, and chairman Harold Hornsey appointed Houchen as his replacement; he became the 23rd manager at the club in 38 years. He appointed his former boss Billy Horner as youth team coach and also employed Brian Honour and Mick Tait. His first game in charge was a 4\u20130 home win over Hereford United, and a 3\u20130 defeat at Preston North End and a final day 3\u20132 victory over Mansfield Town ensured Hartlepool an 18th-place finish. As a player, he was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 39 appearances in 1994\u201395, and was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters."]}]}}
