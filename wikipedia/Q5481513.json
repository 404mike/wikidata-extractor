A part of the area later was belonging to the King\u2019s manor of Mansfield. Later history was poorly documented. In the latter 1500s and 1600s Rayton was the residence and the property of the Eyre family, of which some of their relations held Grove Hall and its manor. There was also an ancient hall which stood in a much lower location near the river, but nothing of this remains. The manor eventually became united with the Scofton estate which was then sold to Francis Foljambe.A farmhouse, together with two or three cottages, form the hamlet. Thievesdale Lane marked the upper extent of this area."]}]}}
