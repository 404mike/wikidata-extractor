Smyllie was educated at Sligo Grammar School and entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1912. Working as a vacation tutor to an American boy in Germany at the start of World War I, he was detained in Ruhleben internment camp, near Berlin, during the war. As an internee, he was involved in drama productions with other internees.\nOn returning to Ireland, he reported on the Versailles Treaty for The Irish Times, then edited by John E. Healy. He contributed to the still ongoing \"Irishman\u2019s Diary\" column of the paper from 1927. In 1934, he was  appointed editor of the paper, in succession to Healy. He established a non-partisan profile and a modern Irish character for the erstwhile ascendancy paper; for example, he dropped \"Kingstown Harbour\" for \"D\u00fan Laoghaire\". He was assisted by Alec Newman and Lionel Fleming, recruited Patrick Campbell  and enlisted Flann O\u2019Brien to write his thrice-weekly column \"Cruiskeen Lawn\" as Myles na gCopaleen.", "link_mentions": []}}
