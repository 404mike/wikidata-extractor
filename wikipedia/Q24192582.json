In making his 1981 re-recording of the Goldberg Variations, Glenn Gould considered playing this variation at a slower tempo, in keeping with the tempo of the preceding variation (Variation 16), but ultimately decided not to because \"Variation 17 is one of those rather skittish, slightly empty-headed collections of scales and arpeggios which Bach indulged when he wasn't writing sober and proper things like fugues and canons, and it just seemed to me that there wasn't enough substance to it to warrant such a methodical, deliberate, Germanic tempo.\""]}, {"page": "Wilhelm Friedemann Bach", "response": ["Friedemann was appointed in 1733 to the position of organist of the St. Sophia's Church at Dresden.

Gregory Butler argues that at the same service (which he dates to Christmas 1745, to celebrate the Peace of Dresden), Bach also used the 1724 Sanctus,Gregory Butler, \"Johann Sebastian Bachs Gloria in excelsis Deo BWV 191: Musik f\u00fcr ein Leipziger Dankfest\", Bach Jahrbuch 78 (1992), pp. 65\u201371 and that this revisiting of the 1733 Missa suggested further development to the composer.", "Scholars differ, however, on whether the Missa was performed in July in Dresden. Christoph Wolff argues that on July 26, 1733 at the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Wilhelm Friedemann Bach had been organist since June, it \"was definitely performed ... as evidenced by the extant Dresden performing parts and by the inscription on the title wrapper\" given to the king the next day.Christoph Wolff, Bach: The Learned Musician, W.W.

Bach\"; translation John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor pp. 11\u201312. However, Joshua Rifkin rejects the argument, pointing out that the past-tense wording was typical of formal address often not related to performance.Joshua Rifkin, Review of facsimile editions of Bach's Mass in B Minor, Notes 44 (1988), pp. 787\u201398 Also skeptical is Peter Williams, who notes that \"there is no record of performers being assembled for such an event, and in August 1731 Friedemann reported that the Sophienkirche organ was badly out of tune.\"Peter Williams, J.S. Bach: A Life in Music, Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 219\u201320,  However, there is evidence of an organ recital by Bach at the Sophienkirche on 14 September 1731, and Friedemann Bach was only chosen as Organist for the institution on 23 June 1733.

In the last quarter of the 20th century, scholars such as Peter Williams and Rolf-Dietrich Claus published their studies on the piece and argued against its authenticity. Bach scholars like Christoph Wolff defended the attribution to Bach. Other commentators ignored the doubts over its authenticity, or considered the attribution issue undecided. ", "In 1980, Peter Williams wrote about BWV 565 in the first volume of his The Organ Music of J.S.Bach. The author warns against numerological over-interpretation like that of Volker Gwinner. Many parts of the composition are described as typical of Bach. Williams sees stylistic matches with Pachelbel, with the north German organ school, and with the Italian violin school, but sees various unusual features of the composition as well. Williams questions the authenticity of the piece, based on its various unusual features, and elaborates the idea that the piece may have a violin version ancestor.Williams 1980, pp. 214\u201321 The reworked edition of this book, in one volume, appeared in 2003, and devotes more pages to discussing the authenticity and possible prior versions of BWV 565. In the meantime, Williams had written a 1981 article on the authenticity of BWV 565; this was followed by numerous publications by other scholars on the same topic.Gwinner 1968", "In a 1981 article, Peter Williams reiterated the speculations, from which he saw a way out of the conundrum, already featured in his 1980 book on Bach's organ compositions:", "These doubts about the authorship of BWV 565 were elaborated by Peter Williams in a 1981 article. Hypotheses proposed by Williams in that article included that BWV 565 may have been composed after 1750 and may have been based on an earlier composition for another instrument, supposedly violin. Williams added more stylistic problems to the ones already mentioned by Bullivant, among others the parallel octaves throughout the opening of the toccata, the true subdominant answers in the fugue, and the primitive harmonies throughout the piece, with countersubjects in the fugue frequently moving through thirds and sixths only. All of these characteristics are either unique or extremely rare in organ music of the first half of the 18th century."]}, {"page": "Eight Short Preludes and Fugues", "response": ["While originally attributed to Bach, scientific examination of the extant manuscripts by Alfred D\u00fcrr in 1987 and subsequent stylistic analysis of the score by Peter Williams have suggested that the eight preludes and fugues might have been composed by one of his pupils, Johann Ludwig Krebs. As Williams explains, whoever the composer was, the works show an ability to compose in diverse ways\u2014the toccata, the Italian concerto, the galant style, the fughetta and the durezze style with slow suspensions, favoured by Girolamo Frescobaldi. It has not yet been possible to date the compositions, but Williams writes: \"Though frequently charming and melodious, they could hardly have been written by J. S. Bach for his pupils since their 'standard of counterpoint and general musicianship' does not fit the period in question, nor does the scarcity of copies suggest they were much used, [...] even as part of a bigger compendium. Nevertheless, the pieces do amount to a fine book for learners, teaching whether or how to add pedal, use a second manual, and register according to so-called key characteristics.\"", ":The prelude of BWV 555 is in the durezza style of suspended dissonances, typified by the ricercars of Frescobaldi; the model is adapted from the traditions of organ versets in Southern Germany, rather than string trio sonatas. Peter Williams considers that the fugue is probably the best in the collection \"with stretto, inversus, and a counterpoint typical of earlier treatments of the descending chromatic fourth.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Williams", "response": ["*Peter Williams (musicologist) (1937\u20132016), English musicology professor and Bach scholar", "*Peter Williams (educationalist) (born 1948), British educationalist", "*Peter Williams (dance critic) (1914\u20131995), English ballet critic and writer", "*Peter Williams (American actor) (1915-2003), American-British actor", "*Jim Bowen (born Peter Williams, 1937\u20132018), English stand-up comedian", "*Peter Williams (painter) (born 1952), American painter", "*Peter Williams (broadcaster) (born 1954), New Zealand television presenter", "*Peter Williams (actor) (born 1957), Jamaican actor", "*Peter Williams (Titans), fictional character the television series Titans", "*Sir Peter Williams (lawyer) (1934\u20132015), New Zealand jurist", "*Peter Williams (Welsh Methodist) (1723\u20131796), leader of Welsh Methodism", "*Peter Williams Jr. (1780\u20131840), African-American Episcopal priest", "*Peter Williams (physician) (1925\u20132014), British physician", "*Sir Peter Williams (physicist) (born 1945), British physicist, chairman of Oxford Instruments; Chancellor, University of Leicester", "*Peter Williams (Australian footballer, born 1867) (1867\u20131949), VFL footballer for Carlton", "*Peter Williams (Australian footballer, born 1944), VFL footballer for Fitzroy", "*Peter Williams (Australian footballer, born 1957), VFL footballer for Richmond", "*Peter Williams (Irish cricketer) (1897\u20131971), Irish cricketer for Sussex and several other teams in England", "*Peter Williams (Australian cricketer) (born 1942), Australian cricketer, played for Victoria", "*Peter Williams (South African cricketer) (1957\u20132014), South African cricketer", "*Peter Williams (rugby union, born 1884) (1884\u20131976), New Zealand rugby union international footballer", "*Peter Williams (English footballer) (born 1931), English footballer", "*Peter Williams (motorcyclist) (1939\u20132020), British motorcycle racer, participant in the Isle of Man TT, 1967", "*Peter Williams (rugby, born 1958), English rugby union and rugby league footballer", "*Peter Williams (footballer, born 1960), Welsh association footballer", "*Peter Williams (swimmer) (born 1968), South African swimmer", "*Peter Williams (alpine skier) (born 1983), New Zealand para-alpine sit-skier", "*Peter Williams (cyclist) (born 1986), British racing cyclist", "*Peter Williams (Medal of Honor) (1831\u2013?), American Civil War sailor", "*Peter Williams (businessman) (born 1974), British businessman, co-founder of Jack Wills clothing brand"]}, {"page": "Johann Sebastian Bach", "response": ["Bach's music has influenced other genres. For instance, jazz musicians have adopted Bach's music, with Jacques Loussier, Ian Anderson, Uri Caine, and the Modern Jazz Quartet among those creating jazz versions of his works.

Establishing the history or purpose of any of the harpsichord concertos, however, is not a straightforward task. At present attempts to reconstruct the compositional history can only be at the level of plausible suggestions or conjectures, mainly because very little of Bach's instrumental music has survived and, even when it has, sources are patchy. In particular this makes it hard not only to determine the place, time and purpose of the original compositions but even to determine the original key and intended instrument.", "The harpsichord part in the autograph manuscript is not a \"fair copy\" but a composing score with numerous corrections. The orchestral parts on the other hand were executed as a fair copy. Various possible explanations have been proposed as to why Bach assembled the collection of harpsichord concertos at this particular time. One centres on his role as director of the Collegium Musicum in Leipzig, a municipal musical society, which gave weekly concerts at the Caf\u00e9 Zimmermann, drawing many performers from students at the university. Bach served as director from spring 1729 to summer 1737; and again from October 1739 until 1740 or 1741. John Butt suggests that the manuscript was prepared for performances on Bach's resumption as director in 1739, additional evidence coming from the fact that the manuscript subsequently remained in Leipzig. Peter Wollny, however, considers it unlikely that The Collegium Musicum would have required orchestral parts that were so neatly draughted; he considers it more plausible that the manuscript was prepared for a visit that Bach made to Dresden in 1738 when he would almost certainly have given private concerts in court (or to the nobility) and the ripieno parts would have been played by the resident orchestra. Peter Williams has also suggested that the collection would have been a useful addition to the repertoire of his two elder sons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel, both employed as professional keyboard-players at the time of writing. Williams has also speculated that it might not be mere coincidence that the timing matched the publication of the first ever collection of keyboard concertos, the widely acclaimed and well-selling Organ concertos, Op.4 of George Frederic Handel published in London and Paris in 1738."]}]}}
