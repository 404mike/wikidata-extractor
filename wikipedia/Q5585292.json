He highlighted the importance of wheat, barley and rye, and suggested that domestication of flax, peas, chickpeas, bitter vetch and lentils came a little later. Based on analysis of the genes of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each taxon that spread in an arc from the Levantine corridor around the Fertile Crescent and later into Europe.Zohary, D., The mode of domestication of the founder crops of Southwest Asian agriculture. pp. 142\u2013158 in D.

Monographie du CRA 6, \u00c9ditions Centre Nationale Recherches Scientifiques: Paris, 1992 Some of the pioneering attempts failed at first and crops were abandoned, sometimes to be taken up again and successfully domesticated thousands of years later: rye, tried and abandoned in Neolithic Anatolia, made its way to Europe as weed seeds and was successfully domesticated in Europe, thousands of years after the earliest agriculture. Wild lentils presented a different problem: most of the wild seeds do not germinate in the first year; the first evidence of lentil domestication, breaking dormancy in their first year, appears in the early Neolithic at Jerf el Ahmar (in modern Syria), and lentils quickly spread south to the Netiv HaGdud site in the Jordan Valley. The process of domestication allowed the founder crops to adapt and eventually become larger, more easily harvested, more dependable in storage and more useful to the human population."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Gordon Hillman, Honorary Visiting Professor in Archaeobotany (Palaeoethnobotany)"]}, {"page": "1943 in archaeology", "response": ["* July 20 - Gordon Hillman, British archaeobotanist (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "Chinstrap beard", "response": ["* Gordon Hillman"]}, {"page": "Hillman (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Gordon Hillman (1943\u20132018), British archaeobotanist"]}, {"page": "List of paleoethnobotanists", "response": ["*Gordon Hillman"]}, {"page": "Bexhill College", "response": ["*Gordon Hillman, archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Anthony Legge", "response": ["Work on Tell Abu Hureyra has shown that this is one of the few sites where the process of plant and animal domestication can be followed in detail, and is the only such site dug with modern methods with abundant samples of the organic remains needed in such investigations (see also Gordon Hillman).

He has been employed as researcher with the CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique)France since 1989. He has dual French and British nationality. He studied environmental archaeology under the late Prof. Dimbleby at the Institute of Archaeology  in London during the early 1970s and was then was employed as environmental archaeologist by the Museum of London. In 1977 he married and left his job to follow his interest in Near Eastern archaeobotany. An interest which he had acquired as an undergraduate  working with Gordon Hillman in Turkey. During the next few years he worked in Turkey, Afghanistan Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Tajikistan, India and Syria and started amassing a charred archaeobotanical collection and modern reference collection. These are now housed at the Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019Histoire naturelle  in Paris. It was during this somewhat precarious period that he moved to France and founded a family.
