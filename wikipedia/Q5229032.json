He began his career replacing Mark \"Barney\" Greenway in UK death metal band Benediction when Greenway decided to focus solely on Napalm Death. Ingram stayed with Benediction until March 1998, when he joined Bolt Thrower, officially replacing Martin van Drunen after having handled vocals temporarily for the band during a show on 4 July 1997 in Zwickau Germany.\nIn 2004, Ingram left Bolt Thrower due to health problems, just prior to the recording of Those Once Loyal. He later performed vocals on an album by Warlord UK and sang in his own band Downlord until the band disbanded in 2008.  Later that same year, he began Metal Breakfast Radio, an online metal show that reviews new music from underground bands in a unique and somewhat humorous manner. Ingram's own website can be found at www.darksentinel.dk\nIn a departure from his metal roots, Ingram launched a big band jazz and swing themed online streaming radio program called Lambert's Basement. The title of the show is a tribute to his father Lawrence Albert Lambert Ingram.The post-Downlord period saw Ingram involved in a number of other bands and projects. His collaboration with Rogga Johansson lead to the bands Down Among The Dead Men and Echelon.\nIn late 2015, Ingram was announced as the new vocalist for Dutch death metal band Hail of Bullets in anticipation of their appearance at Maryland Deathfest in May 2016. At the conclusion of the band's set, Hail of Bullets guitarist Stephan Geb\u00e9di announced Ingram had joined the band on a permanent basis. (In an odd coincidence, Ingram was again replacing van Drunen). The band announced their disbandment in March 2017.In July 2019, Benediction announced Ingram had rejoined the band, following Dave Hunt's departure. The first album with Ingram, Scriptures, was released 16 October 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bolt Thrower", "response": ["In 1995 and 1996 they went on two European tours.p In 1997, Martin van Drunen decided to leave the band as he felt that he never really became a part of Bolt Thrower, and because he had a disease that made his hair fall out and gave him insecurity on stage. For at least one show in Germany, long time friend Dave Ingram stood in. Martin Kearns also decided to leave the band. The position at the drum kit is now taken by Alex Thomas. Karl Willetts temporarily rejoined the band to do vocal duties on their next album. The band switched record labels from Earache to Metal Blade Records, because since the US ...For Victory tour they had seen a lack of success with Earache. Earache had also wanted to get rid of them and Bolt Thrower wanted to leave Earache as soon as possible, so they parted company.", "The album titled Mercenary was released on 8 September 1998 in Europe and on 10 November 1998 in the US and features nine tracks. It is an overall slower album than its predecessors. However, it is definitely very heavy and sounds very much like classic Bolt Thrower. Karl also returned to performing his previous style of singing; the hardcore punk influences have disappeared again. After the album recording, Karl left the band again and the band recruited Dave Ingram permanently after he left Benediction.", "In November 1998, Earache Records released Who Dares Wins, a compilation featuring various older recordings, including the Spearhead and Cenotaph EPs. The band members themselves do not approve of the compilation's release and warn not to buy it, considering it a cheap cash-in from Earache. Originally, it was titled No Guts - No Glory but the title was changed because one song on Mercenary has the same title and Metal Blade Records objected. Following the release of Mercenary, the band embarked on a tour of Europe, called Into the Killing Zone, with Dave Ingram on vocals. Alex Thomas departed since he lacked interest in the musical direction of Bolt Thrower.", "In 2004, the band began working on new material for their latest album. They intended to record it in May 2004, with the release set to the end of the year by Metal Blade. Meanwhile, a European tour and a US tour were being prepared. Unfortunately, right before the recording could begin, Dave Ingram decided to leave due to health and personal issues. This postponed the new record and tours, and priority was set to finding a new singer. On 18 November 2004 the band announced the return of Karl Willetts. Recording of the album, titled Those Once Loyal, started in May 2005; it was released on 11 November in Germany, 14 November in the rest of Europe and 15 November in the United States, 2005. It has been met with widespread critical acclaim from magazines such as Rock Sound, Rock Hard and Metal Hammer. A European tour followed in January and February 2006.
