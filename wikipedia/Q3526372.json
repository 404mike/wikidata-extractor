He died in the campaign to relieve Mafeking during the Second Boer War.\nBorn in Farnborough, Hampshire, England, Milligan was a talented all-rounder who bowled at a lively pace, fielded well and went for his strokes with the bat.  He excelled for the Gentlemen v Players at The Oval in 1897, scoring 47 in each innings, and snaring two wickets for three runs in the Players' second innings; while at Scarborough a year later he took seven second innings wickets for 61.  He played County Championship cricket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, despite having been born outside the county boundaries, and achieved ten half centuries and 144 wickets in a total of 95 first-class games from 1894 to 1898\u201399. He played his two Test matches on Lord Hawke's tour of South Africa in 1898\u201399.\nHe stayed on in South Africa after the tour, and served under Colonel Plumer in the Second Boer War, holding the rank of lieutenant at the time of his death in action in Ramatlabama, South Africa, at the age of 30. A memorial window, as well as a memorial brass, were dedicated to him in St Mark's church, Low Moor (which is now a private house). There is a memorial sundial to him in the rose garden of Harold Park, Bradford, West Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Frank Milligan"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Frank Milligan \u00b7"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Frank Milligan"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Frank Milligan, cricketer, was born in Farnborough"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Frank Milligan (1897\u20131898)"]}, {"page": "Harold Park, Bradford", "response": ["North of the lodge is a rose garden with a memorial sundial to the memory of cricketer Lieutenant Frank Milligan who died in 1900 at the age of 30, in an attempt to relieve the siege of Mafeking during the Second Boer War."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1895\u20131914)", "response": ["* Frank Milligan (1897) : F.
