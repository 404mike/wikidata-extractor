As explained in the program, the production of \"Heart of Glass\" was built around the use of a Roland CR-78 drum machine. The CR-78 was first introduced in 1978, the same year that Parallel Lines was recorded, and the use of this device on \"Heart of Glass\" was, according to the program, among the earliest uses of this device in popular music.
