A second defeat of the season came after losing 2\u20130 away to Kidderminster, Brian Smikle and Justin Richards scoring for the home team. Beadle was released by the club towards the end of his loan spell at Whitby, due to him looking for regular first-team football. This was followed by the departure of Bore, who returned to Grimsby from his loan spell early. A 3\u20133 draw away against Stevenage was achieved after the team were 2\u20130 down after 19 minutes, with the York goals coming from Sodje, Holmes and Farrell. Sodje picked up a hamstring injury during this match, meaning he would be out of action for four to six weeks."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Cheltenham Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Brian Smikle", "| Brian Smikle"]}, {"page": "2007 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|RM ||18|| Brian Smikle || || "]}, {"page": "2012 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["|MF ||11||Brian Smikle"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Cheltenham Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Brian Smikle"]}, {"page": "List of Kidderminster Harriers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Brian Smikle"]}, {"page": "Smikle, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Smikle"]}, {"page": "Smikle", "response": ["* Brian Smikle (born 1985), English footballer"]}]}}
