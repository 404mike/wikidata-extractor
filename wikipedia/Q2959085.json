Some, such as Charles Fox Burney,Burney, C. F., The Book of Judges with introduction and notes, Rivingtons, London (1920) suggest that Bochim is actually another name for Bethel, and Anglican theologian George Albert Cooke, writing in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, has \"little doubt\" that the two are the same.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Judges 2, accessed 12 October 2016 Burney draws attention to the unusual appearance of the name 'Bochim' before the incident after which the place is supposedly named, as well as highlighting the Septuagint translation of verse 1: 'to Bochim and to Bethel and to the House of Israel'.Amit, Hidden Polemics, pp. 119-120. Other commentators suggest that Bochim was located near Bethel, and that the lack of other Biblical mentions is due to Bochim ceasing to be an important place in the life of Israel. Y. Kaufmann proposes that Bochim was a place of assembly near to Bethel, whilst G. F. Moore has associated Bochim with Shiloh.Gomes, The Sanctuary of Bethel, p. 117. Other theories have also been advanced."]}, {"page": "Charles Burney (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Charles Fox Burney (1868\u20131925), Biblical scholar at Oxford University, England"]}]}}
