The missionary George Taplin chose it, spelling the term as Narrinyeri, as a generic ethnonym to designate a unified constellation several distinct tribes, and bearing the meaning of \"belonging to people\", as opposed to kringgari (whites). Etymologically, it is thought to be an abbreviation of kornarinyeri (\"belonging to men/human beings\", formed narr (linguistically plain or intelligible) and inyeri, a suffix indicating belongingness. It implied that those outside the group were not quite human. Other terms were available, for example, Kukabrak, but Taplin's authority popularised the other term.", "By way of contrast and due to a shared dreaming, the relationship between the Ngarrindjeri and the Walkandi-woni (the people of the warm north-east wind), their collective name for the various groups living along the River as far as Wentworth in New South Wales, was of significant mutual importance and the groups regularly met at Wellington, Tailem Bend, Murray Bridge, Mannum or Swan Reach to exchange songs and conduct ceremonies.
