These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books. According to Graeme Kirkpatrick, the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with gameplay. Escapist founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"cinemaphile\". People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify. Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly. Notably, during the Gamergate Controversy that began in August 2014, the gaming press responded to anger from gamers with numerous articles calling the gamer identity \"dead\" due to changing demographic shifts, despite continuing to use the term to attract advertisers."]}, {"page": "British Sociological Association", "response": ["The Philip Abrams Memorial Prize has been awarded almost every year since 1989 for \"the best first and sole-authored book within the discipline of Sociology\".
