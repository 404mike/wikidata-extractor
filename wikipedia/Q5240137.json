Some will recoil from the gore, but Braindead wasn't made for them.\" Peter Rainer of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the film, stating that it \"is the most hilariously disgusting movie ever made. It makes something like Re-Animator seem like a UNESCO documentary about Mother Teresa.\" The film received a negative review from The Independent writer Quentin Curtis, who complained that \"it never decides whether to make you tremble with laughter or fear, and has outstayed its welcome long before the last limb has been severed and entrail spilled.\" For Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman wrote that the film was \"breezy and good-natured\", giving praise to the gore special effects."]}, {"page": "Whale Rider", "response": ["The film received critical acclaim and Castle-Hughes's performance won rave reviews.

The Los Angeles Timess Kenneth Turan praised Caro for her \"willingness to let this story tell itself in its own time and the ability to create emotion that is intense without being cloying or dishonest.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and praised Castle-Hughes' acting, saying \"so effectively does she convey her pained confusion through subtle vocal cues, tentative stance and expressive dark eyes.\""]}, {"page": "Trowbridge", "response": ["David Stratton, the film critic, journalist, film historian and lecturer, television personality and producer, was born in Trowbridge in 1939.

In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thriller Speed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent and blockbuster films. The film starred Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric as a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker. Speed 2 was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, with Dafoe himself receiving a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor. For his next film, Affliction (1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother of Nick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator. Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons titled \"The Secret War of Lisa Simpson\", voicing the commandant of a military academy that Bart and Lisa Simpson are attending. Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery drama Lulu on the Bridge, Dafoe starred alongside Christopher Walken and Asia Argento in Abel Ferrara's cyberpunk drama New Rose Hotel in 1998.
