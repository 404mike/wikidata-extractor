The development of these communities is clearly linked to a preponderance of women in urban centers in the Middle Ages, but while earlier scholars like the Belgian historian Henri Pirenne believed that this \"surplus\" of women was caused by men dying in war, that theory has been debunked. Since the groundbreaking work of John Hajnal, who demonstrated that, for much of Europe, marriage occurred later in life and at a lower frequency than had previously been believed, historians have established that single women moved to the newly developed cities because those cities offered them work opportunities.  has shown how the smaller beguinages as well as the court beguinages answered such women's social and economic needs, in addition to offering them a religious life coupled with personal independence, which was a difficult thing to have for a woman."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* John Hajnal, statistician"]}, {"page": "Hajnal line", "response": ["The Hajnal line is an imaginary line \"Hajnal (1965) outlined two marriage patterns that historically prevailed in Europe, geographically delineated by an imaginary line connecting Saint Petersburg and Trieste (referred to also as Hajnal's line).\" \"John Hajnal published the revolutionary essay \u201cEuropean Marriage Patterns in Perspective,\u201d which divided Europe along an imaginary line known as the \u201cHajnal line,\u201d one that separated Eastern and Western Europe\" \"although (for brevity) he calls it \u201cEuropean,\u201d he defines it as being applicable only to the Northwestern Europe, west of an imaginary line connecting \u201cLeningrad\u201d (Saint Petersburg) to Trieste\" \"The existence of an imaginary line which ran down from St Petersburg to Trieste and neatly separated western and eastern European marriage and family patterns has been one of the basic tenets of historical demography and family history for half a century.\" that is drawn between Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Trieste, Italy.
