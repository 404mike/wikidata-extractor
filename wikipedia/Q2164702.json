He practised at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptics, Queen Square, London (now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery) from 1870\u20131910, ran a consultancy from his home in Queen Anne Street, W1, and lectured at University College Hospital.  He published extensively, but is probably best remembered for his two-volume Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System (1886, 1888), affectionately referred to at Queen Square as the Bible of Neurology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cerebral palsy", "response": ["The modern understanding of CP as resulting from problems within the brain began in the early decades of the 1800s with a number of publications on brain abnormalities by Johann Christian Reil, Claude Fran\u00e7ois Lallemand and Philippe Pinel. Later physicians used this research to connect problems in the brain with specific symptoms. The English surgeon William John Little (18101894) was the first person to study CP extensively. In his doctoral thesis he stated that CP was a result of a problem around the time of birth. He later identified a difficult delivery, a preterm birth and perinatal asphyxia in particular as risk factors. The spastic diplegia form of CP came to be known as Little's disease. At around this time, a German surgeon was also working on cerebral palsy, and distinguished it from polio. In the 1880s British neurologist William Gowers built on Little's work by linking paralysis in newborns to difficult births. He named the problem \"birth palsy\" and classified birth palsies into two types: peripheral and cerebral."]}, {"page": "Complete blood count", "response": ["The physiologist Karl Vierordt is credited with performing the first blood count.  His technique, published in 1852, involved aspirating a carefully measured volume of blood into a capillary tube and spreading it onto a microscope slide coated with egg white. After the blood dried, he counted every cell on the slide; this process could take more than three hours to complete.Davis, JD (1995). p. 167. The hemocytometer, introduced in 1874 by Louis-Charles Malassez, simplified the microscopic counting of blood cells.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 4. Malassez's hemocytometer consisted of a microscope slide containing a flattened capillary tube. Diluted blood was introduced to the capillary chamber by means of a rubber tube attached to one end, and an eyepiece with a scaled grid was attached to the microscope, permitting the microscopist to count the number of cells per volume of blood. In 1877, William Gowers invented a hemocytometer with a built-in counting grid, eliminating the need to produce specially calibrated eyepieces for each microscope.Davis, JD (1995). pp. 168\u2013171."]}, {"page": "Sir William Richard Gowers", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Gowers (neurologist)"]}, {"page": "William Gowers", "response": ["William Gowers may refer to:", "*William Gowers (neurologist) (William Richard Gowers, 1845\u20131915), British neurologist"]}, {"page": "Upper motor neuron", "response": ["Upper motor neurons (UMNs) is a term introduced by William Gowers in 1886.
