He practised at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptics, Queen Square, London (now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery) from 1870\u20131910, ran a consultancy from his home in Queen Anne Street, W1, and lectured at University College Hospital.  He published extensively, but is probably best remembered for his two-volume Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System (1886, 1888), affectionately referred to at Queen Square as the Bible of Neurology.", "link_mentions": {}}}
