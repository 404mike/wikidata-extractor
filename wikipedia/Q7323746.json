The BEF sector ran along the Dyle about  from Louvain, south-west to Wavre. The 3rd Division (II Corps) took the north with the 1st Division and 2nd Division (I Corps) the south, some battalions defending a frontage double that recommended in British manuals. The rest of the BEF formed a defence in depth back to the River Escaut. The Dyle north of Louvain was occupied by Belgian troops who refused to give way, even when Brooke appealed to the King of the Belgians and Georges ordered them out. The British infantry began to arrive on the Dyle on 11 May and dug in screened by light tanks and Bren carriers operating west of the river until 14 May, when the front line units were ready; the bridges were then blown. Later that day probes by reconnaissance troops of three German infantry divisions were dispersed. Next day, attacks on Louvain by the German 19th Division were repulsed by the 3rd Division. Further south, the river was only about  wide, preventing tanks from crossing but passable by infantry. Richard Annand of the Durham Light Infantry in the southern sector was awarded a Victoria Cross. German bridgeheads across the Dyle were either eliminated or contained by British counter-attacks."]}, {"page": "Dickie Annand", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Annand"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2004", "response": ["*Capt.

They were apparently unaware of the British positions and in several places approached the Dyle without taking cover, where they were an easy target for small arms fire and artillery. Later in the evening, parts of the line were fired on by German field guns, the first experience for many British troops of enemy fire. Organised German attacks commenced on 15 May when attacks on Louvain by the German 19th Infantry Division were repulsed by 3rd Division, commanded by Major General Bernard Montgomery. On the left of the division's line, the 1st Grenadier Guards were forced to abandon their forward positions and withdraw behind the Dyle Canal which ran a short distance to the west of the river, but there the line held. At dawn on the following day, following a two hour barrage, a determined attack was made on Louvain railway station and the adjacent goods yard, but after a prolonged fight, the Germans were thrown back in a counter-attack by the 1st Royal Ulster Rifles and the 1st King's Own Scottish Borderers. Further south, the River was only about 15 feet wide, and while it prevented tanks from crossing, it was a less effective barrier to a determined infantry assault. During one such attack at the south of the BEF line near Wavre, 2nd Lieutenant Richard Annand of the 2nd Durham Light Infantry earned a Victoria Cross by preventing troops of the German 31st Infantry Division from crossing a demolished bridge by repeatedly throwing grenades onto them, and when finally ordered to withdraw, attempting to rescue a wounded soldier in a wheelbarrow. All the German bridgeheads across the Dyle were either repulsed or effectively contained by British counter-attacks, but by the morning of 16 May, events far to the south had caused Gort to be ordered to withdraw the BEF back to the Escaut."]}]}}
