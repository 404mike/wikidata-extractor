He played for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and was the elder brother of W. G. and Fred Grace. All three played for England against Australia in September 1880 two weeks before Fred Grace died. Always known by his initials, E. M. Grace controversially held amateur status but was criticised for the money he made by playing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. G. Grace", "response": ["Grace came from a cricketing family: E. M. Grace was one of his elder brothers and Fred Grace his younger brother. In 1880, they were members of the same England team, the first time three brothers played together in Test cricket. Grace took part in other sports also: he was a champion 440-yard hurdler as a young man and played football for the Wanderers. In later life, he developed enthusiasm for golf, lawn bowls and curling.", "W. G. Grace was born in Downend, near Bristol, on 18 July 1848 at his parents' home, Downend House, and was baptised at the local church on 8 August.Rae, p.16. He was called Gilbert in the family circle, except by his mother, who apparently called him Willie, but otherwise, as \"W. G.\", he was universally known by his initials. His parents were Henry Mills Grace and Martha (n\u00e9e Pocock), who were married in Bristol on Thursday, 3 November 1831 and lived out their lives at Downend, where Henry Grace was the local GP.Rae, pp.9\u201311. Downend is near Mangotsfield and, although it is now a suburb of Bristol, it was then \"a distinct village surrounded by countryside\" and about four miles from Bristol.Rae, p.11. Henry and Martha Grace had nine children in all: \"the same number as Victoria and Albert\u00a0\u2013 and in every respect they were the typical Victorian family\".Rae, pp.12\u201313. Grace was the eighth child in the family; he had three older brothers, including E. M. Grace (always known as \"E. M.\"), and four older sisters. The ninth child was his younger brother Fred Grace, born in 1850.Midwinter, pp.9\u201310.", "I am writing to ask you to consider the inclusion of my son, E. M. Grace\u00a0\u2013 a splendid hitter and most excellent catch\u00a0\u2013 in your England XI. I am sure he would play very well and do the team much credit. It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.", "There was bad feeling between Grace and some of the 1878 Australians, especially their manager John Conway; this came to a head on 20 June in a row over the services of Grace's friend Billy Midwinter, an Australian who had played for Gloucestershire in 1877. Midwinter was already in England before the main Australian party arrived and had joined them for their first match in May. On 20 June, Midwinter was at Lord's where he was due to play for the Australians against Middlesex. On the same day, the Gloucestershire team was at The Oval to play Surrey but arrived a man short. As a result, a group of Gloucestershire players led by W. G. and E. M. Grace went to Lord's and persuaded Midwinter to accompany them back to The Oval to make up their numbers.Bowen, p. 130, says that Midwinter was still under a contractual obligation to Gloucestershire and that the Australian press had reported this before the team embarked. They were pursued by three of the Australians who caught them at The Oval gates where a furious altercation ensued in front of bystanders. At one point, Grace called the Australians \"a damned lot of sneaks\" (he later apologised). In the end, Grace got his way and Midwinter stayed with Gloucestershire for the rest of the season, although he did not play for the county against the Australians.Birley, pp. 111\u2013112. Afterwards, the row was patched up and Gloucestershire invited the Australians to play the county team, minus Midwinter, at Clifton College.Midwinter, pp. 70\u201372. The Australians took a measure of revenge and won easily by 10 wickets, with Fred Spofforth taking 12 wickets and making the top score. It was Gloucestershire's first ever home defeat.Midwinter, p.72. The events at The Oval had a postscript during the following winter when W. G. and E. M. were called to account by the Gloucestershire membership because of the expenses they had claimed from Surrey for that match, and which Surrey had refused to authorise.", "Grace's 1865 debut in the fixture did not turn the tide as the Players won at The Oval by 118 runs. He played quite well and took seven wickets in the match but could only score 23 and 12 not out. In the second 1865 match, this time at Lord's, the Gentlemen finally ended their losing streak and won by 8 wickets, but it was E. M. Grace, not W. G., who was the key factor with 11 wickets in the match. Even so, Grace made his mark by scoring 34 out of 77\u20132 in the second innings to steer the Gentlemen to victory."]}, {"page": "Thornbury, Gloucestershire", "response": ["*E. M.

He did not reach 50 in his next three appearances for the county, but against Gloucestershire he top-scored for his side in their first innings with 59, and then when Somerset were forced to follow on, he scored his only century in first-class cricket, amassing 116 runs before he became one of W. G. Grace's eleven victims in the match. Sainsbury played in seven matches during 1883, and achieved his highest batting average in a season, his century and two fifties boosting him to 27.92. Although he played another 31 first-class matches during his career, he did not score more than 40 runs in an innings after 1883. He also recorded his best bowling average in 1883, claiming his nine first-class wickets at 18.55. In early June 1884, Sainsbury played for a side representing the South of England, scoring 3 and 29 during a 66-run victory for the South. Playing for Lansdown against the touring Gentlemen of Philadelphia the following month, he scored the only century of the match, reaching 108, and sharing a first wicket partnership of 149 with E. M. Grace. He batted poorly for Somerset during 1884, failing to reach double figures in most of his innings, and hitting a top score of 30 for the county. His season average was dramatically lower than the previous season, dropping below 10."]}, {"page": "United South of England Eleven", "response": ["The most significant event in the USEE's history was a match in August 1866 at John Walker's Ground against a Southgate XV formed by V.
