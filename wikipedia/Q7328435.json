Shortly afterwards he was selected as the candidate for Swansea West which had been won by the Conservatives by a narrow majority of 403 votes. The constituency, containing the city centre, the university and the relatively prosperous western suburbs, had historically been a marginal one for Labour, in contrast to the more working-class Swansea East. Percy Morris, elected in the Labour landslide of 1945 had seen his majority cut to just over a thousand votes in 1955 before he was ousted by the Conservative Hugh Rees four years later. Williams recaptured the seat in 1964, and held it for nearly 46 years. However, it was never entirely safe, and Rees made two unsuccessful attempts to recapture the seat in 1966 and in 1970. Wiliams had a very tight contest at the 1979 election, in the wake of the \"winter of discontent\" and divisions in the Welsh Labour Party over devolution. He held on by only 401 votes \u2013 only two less than the Tory majority he had overturned in 1964. His majorities thereafter were more secure but the fact that the Liberal Democrats came close to winning the seat after his retirement in 2010 suggests that he had a substantial personal vote."]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Richard Pilkington (1908\u20131976), MP for Widnes (1935\u20131945) and Poole (1951\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "Richard Antony Pilkington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Pilkington (politician, born 1908)"]}, {"page": "Pilkington (surname)", "response": ["* Richard Pilkington (politician, born 1908) (1908\u20131976), British Conservative politician", "* Richard Pilkington (bowls), a former lawn bowls competitor for New Zealand"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Richard Pilkington; MP for Newton (1899\u20131906)", "*Sir Richard Pilkington; MP for Widnes (1935\u20131945) and Poole (1951\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "Richard Pilkington", "response": ["Richard Pilkington may refer to:", "*Richard Pilkington (Newton MP) (1841\u20131908), British Member of Parliament for Newton (1899\u20131906), member of the Pilkington glass-manufacturing family", "*Richard Pilkington (politician, born 1908) (1908\u20131976), British soldier and Member of Parliament for Widnes (1935\u20131945), and Poole (1951\u20131964)", "*Richard Pilkington (bowls), lawn bowls competitor for New Zealand", "*Richard Pilkington (priest) (died 1631), Anglican priest"]}, {"page": "Richard Pilkington (1908 - 1976)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Pilkington (politician, born 1908)"]}, {"page": "Richard Pilkington (1908-1976)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Pilkington (politician, born 1908)"]}, {"page": "Richard Pilkington (1908\u20131976)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Pilkington (politician, born 1908)"]}, {"page": "Antony Pilkington", "response": ["Sir Antony Richard Pilkington (20 June 1935 - 22 September 2000) was the fifth generation and last family member to chair the Pilkington group.", "MP Sir Richard Pilkington was his uncle, with whom he shared a passion for cars.Burke's Landed Gentry 1939,page 1811,Pilkington of Rainford Hall."]}]}}
