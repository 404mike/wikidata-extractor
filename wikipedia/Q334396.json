He is now most remembered for the Labouch\u00e8re Amendment, which for the first time criminalised all male homosexual activity in the United Kingdom.\nLabouch\u00e8re, who came from a wealthy Huguenot banking family, was a junior member of the British diplomatic service before briefly serving in Parliament in 1865\u201368. He lived with the actress Henrietta Hodson from 1868, and they married in 1887. He made a name for himself as a journalist and theatre producer, first buying a stake in The Daily News and in 1876 founding the magazine Truth, which he bankrolled through an extensive series of libel suits. In 1880, he returned to Parliament as the Liberal member for Northampton, and became a key figure in the radical Home Rule wing of the party. He was a controversial figure, and opposition from Queen Victoria as well as from senior Liberals ensured that he was never given a ministerial position. He became increasingly unpopular due to his opposition to the Second Boer War, and resigned from politics in 1906, when he left Britain and retired to Italy.", "link_mentions": {}}}
