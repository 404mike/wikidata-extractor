He is now most remembered for the Labouch\u00e8re Amendment, which for the first time criminalised all male homosexual activity in the United Kingdom.\nLabouch\u00e8re, who came from a wealthy Huguenot banking family, was a junior member of the British diplomatic service before briefly serving in Parliament in 1865\u201368. He lived with the actress Henrietta Hodson from 1868, and they married in 1887. He made a name for himself as a journalist and theatre producer, first buying a stake in The Daily News and in 1876 founding the magazine Truth, which he bankrolled through an extensive series of libel suits. In 1880, he returned to Parliament as the Liberal member for Northampton, and became a key figure in the radical Home Rule wing of the party. He was a controversial figure, and opposition from Queen Victoria as well as from senior Liberals ensured that he was never given a ministerial position. He became increasingly unpopular due to his opposition to the Second Boer War, and resigned from politics in 1906, when he left Britain and retired to Italy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Ewart Gladstone", "response": ["Gladstone was popularly known in his later years as the \"Grand Old Man\" or \"G.O.M.\". The term was used occasionally during the Midlothian election campaign, first became widely associated with him during the 1880 general election, and was ubiquitous in the press by 1882. Henry Labouch\u00e8re and Sir Stafford Northcote have both been credited with coining it; it appears to have been in use before either of them used it publicly, though they may have helped popularise it. While it was originally used to show affectionate reverence, it was quickly adopted more sarcastically by his opponents, using it to emphasise his age. The acronym was sometimes satirised as \"God's Only Mistake\", or after the fall of Khartoum, inverted to \"M.O.G.\", \"Murderer of Gordon\". (Disraeli is often credited with the former, but Lord Salisbury is a more likely origin). The term is still widely used today and is virtually synonymous with Gladstone."]}, {"page": "Queen Victoria", "response": ["Gladstone returned to power after the 1892 general election; he was 82 years old.

It was a comedy two-hander called A Fair Encounter, with Henrietta Labouch\u00e8re taking the other role and coaching Langtry in her acting. Labouch\u00e8re had been a professional actress before she met and married Liberal MP Henry Labouch\u00e8re. Following favorable reviews of this first attempt at the stage, and with further coaching, Langtry made her debut before the London public, playing Kate Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer at the Haymarket TheatreNew International Encyclopedia in December 1881. Critical opinion was mixed, but she was a success with the public. She next performed in Ours at the same theatre.

Its cost has been estimated by one source at \u00a33 million in 1894 money, which is more than \u00a3170 million in 2005 money, and \u00a35.5 million or \u00a3650 million in 2016 money by another source."]}, {"page": "Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery", "response": ["As early as 1876, there were rumours of an engagement.Crewe, Vol 1, p. 119. However, several hurdles had to be overcome before a marriage could take place. While the Jewish Rothschilds were accepted into society, and indeed were close friends of some members of the royal family including the Prince of Wales, as elsewhere in Europe, antisemitic feelings were prevalent in the upper echelons of society; particularly so among those closest to the Queen at court, where following the death of the Prince Consort in 1861 the Rothschilds became pointedly excluded.Ferguson, p. 772. The Queen's equerry Arthur Edward Hardinge referred to the Rothschilds' dining tables as \"resplendent with the Hebrew gold\" going so far as to say a visiting Russian royal needed a \"corrective\" visit to Westminster Abbey following acceptance of Rothschild hospitality. Queen Victoria herself expressed antisemitic views in 1873 when it was proposed that Lionel de Rothschild be elevated to the peerage; the Queen refused, and expressed a reluctance to make a Jew a peer, saying that \"to make a Jew a peer is a step she could not consent to\" and furthermore stating that to give \"a title and mark of her approbation to a Jew\" was something she would not do.Two quotes by Queen Victoria from Ferguson, p. 773. Queen Victoria was eventually persuaded to elevate Hannah de Rothschild's cousin Nathaniel de Rothschild to the peerage in 1884. The present Lord Rothschild is his great-grandson. However, he was not the first Jew to be so honoured, as in 1876 the Queen had elevated her favourite Disraeli to an earldom. Ferguson p774 suggests that although the Queen admitted to an aversion \"to making a person of the Jewish religion a peer\" her true reasons were as much social and political as religious Lord Spencer advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against attending a Rothschild ball with the words \"The Prince ought only to visit those of undoubted position in Society.\" However, this did not prevent the Prince from accepting Rothschild's invitations and gifts privately. While one could be friends with Jews and accept their hospitality, their social status was still not sufficiently elevated to include marriage into the peerage without unfavourable comment.McKinstry, p74 states:\"Anti-Semitism was a powerful force in late Victorian England\".Henry Labouch\u00e8re used his magazine Truth as an organ to attack all Jews when writing of the Rosebery's wedding."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1901\u20131910)", "response": ["*Henry Labouch\u00e8re (1831\u20131912)"]}, {"page": "Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudin\u00ec", "response": ["Di Rudin\u00ec retained his seat in Parliament until his death in 1908.
