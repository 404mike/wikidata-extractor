He was educated at King's College School and King's College London. In 1858 he entered business as a solicitor at the firm of his uncle, also named Charles Harrison. He acquired a large practice in his own right, with major clients being the London Chatham and Dover Railway and the Law Fire Insurance Society. He became an advocate of the rights of tenants to purchase their properties and of the provision of housing for the working classes. In this he was in agreement with the policies of the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. In 1886, he married Lady Harriet Barlow.\nHis active involvement with politics came with the creation of the London County Council in 1889. He was elected as one of the council's first members, representing Bethnal Green South West as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party. He was a leading member of the council, and vice-chairman from 1892 \u2013 1895. His interests in the government of the capital led him to call for the municipalisation of the London docks and the unification of the City of London with the county.\nOn two occasions Harrison stood for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons on behalf of the Liberals. In 1892 he failed to be elected at Plymouth. He stood again at the ensuing general election in 1895, and became one of the town's two members of parliament, while continuing to hold his seat on the London County Council.\nHarrison became suddenly ill with inflammation of the throat at the funeral of Sir Frank Lockwood on 23 December 1897 and died at his London home on the following day from heart failure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London County Council", "response": ["|Charles Harrison||(9 March 1892 \u2013 10 March 1898)||6"]}, {"page": "List of heads of London government", "response": ["* Charles Harrison (9 March 1892 \u2013 10 March 1898)"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Charles Harrison, Liberal MP 1895\u201397"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Harrison"]}, {"page": "Holborn (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["thumb|120px|Charles Harrison"]}, {"page": "Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Harrison"]}, {"page": "Charles Harrison", "response": ["Charles Harrison may refer to:", "*Charles Harrison (artist) (1942-2009), British Conceptual artist & member of the artist group Art & Language.", "*Charles Harrison (RAF officer) (1888\u20131922), World War I flying ace", "*Charles Harrison (Australian politician) (1915\u20131986), member of the South Australian House of Assembly", "*Charles Harrison (Bewdley MP) (1830\u20131888), Liberal MP for Bewdley, 1874\u20131880", "*Charles Harrison (British politician) (1835\u20131897), leading member of London County Council and Liberal MP for Plymouth", "*Charles Harrison (Canadian politician) (1794\u20131879), politician in New Brunswick, Canada", "*Charles Harrison (general) (1740\u20131793), American soldier and uncle of President William Henry Harrison", "*Charles Harrison (musician) (born 1974), British organist", "*Charles Harrison (basketball) (1933\u20132014), American basketball player"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Charles Harrison"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Charles Harrison \u2013 Liberal MP"]}, {"page": "Progressive Party (London)", "response": [":1892: Charles Harrison"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["| Charles Harrison", "| Charles Harrison", "| Charles Harrison MP(died December 1897: seat remained vacant until 1898 election)"]}, {"page": "List of chairmen of the London County Council", "response": ["Charles Harrison (July 1892) ", "| Charles Harrison ", "| Charles Harrison "]}, {"page": "Bethnal Green South West (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Harrison"]}]}}
