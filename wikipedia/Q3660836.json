She retired after the British Open, in May, 2019.\nShe was born in Great Yarmouth. She attended Albany High School, Chorley, which is now called Albany Academy. In July 2007, she married Danny Massaro and became Laura Lengthorn-Massaro. She subsequently dropped 'Lengthorn' from her name and is now known professionally as Laura Massaro.She won her first top-level title at the German Open in 2004 and went on to become British Open champion in 2013 and World Champion in 2014, so become the first Englishwoman to hold both titles at once. She is also a three-time silver medallist for England in Commonwealth Games.\nMassaro has been shortlisted for the Sunday Times Sky Sports Sportswomen of the Year awards. She won the WISPA Player of the Year award in 2011. She won the US Open and the Cleveland Classic in 2011, the Sharm El Sheikh Open in 2010, and the Monte Carlo Classic in 2008.\nMassaro also won the British National Squash Championships in 2011, defeating Jenny Duncalf in the final 7\u201311, 11\u20139, 7\u201311, 11\u20137, 11\u20132. She had previously finished runner-up at the championships in 2008 (losing in the final to Alison Waters 11\u20136, 7\u201311, 8\u201311, 9\u201311).\nAt the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Massaro won a silver medal in the women's doubles (partnering Jenny Duncalf). She followed up four years later at the 2014 Commonwealth Games with two silver medals: silver in singles after finishing runner-up to Nicol David and another silver in doubles with Duncalf.Massaro won the British Open in 2013. She was the first English woman to do so in 22 years.\nLaura's sponsors include 305SQUASH for clothing, Head for rackets, Asics for shoes and Technifibre for strings. She is also sponsored by UK Fast, Proto-Col and CourtCare and is provided with a sponsored car by Corkhills Volkswagen in Wigan. Laura has also recently partnered with HFE (Health and Fitness Education) in order to expand on her existing knowledge and enjoyment of yoga.After starting 2014 brightly by winning the WSA World Tour title in Chicago, Massaro won the biggest title of her career to date at the 2013 World Open in Penang upon beating Nour El Sherbini in the final. Her achievement, alongside that of reigning men's world champion Nick Matthew, meant that England had two reigning world squash champions for the first time.\nMassaro's exceptional 2014 season continued when she was runner-up to David at the British Open in Hull in May.At the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in July, Massaro went unbeaten through the women's singles \u2013 including a semi-final against compatriot Alison Waters \u2013 before falling to David in the gold medal match. She and Duncalf then joined forces in the doubles and won through to the final, where they lost to Indians Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa in straight games.\nOctober saw Massaro reach the quarter-finals of the US Open, where she lost to Nour El-Sherbini. After a string of lacklustre performances throughout late 2014 and early 2015, she progressed to her third British Open final in succession before losing out to eventual victor Camille Serme.\nMassaro started her 2015/16 season in strong fashion as she achieved victory at the US Open and Qatar Classic. Upon beating world No. 1 Raneem El Weleily (who herself ended David's 9-year unbroken streak as world No. 1 several months prior) in the semi-finals of the Hong Kong Open, she became the third Englishwoman (and first since 2004) to ascend to the top of the world rankings.She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to squash.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Squash Championships", "response": ["|  Laura Massaro", "|  Laura Massaro", "|  Laura Massaro"]}, {"page": "Duffield, Derbyshire", "response": ["* Duffield Squash Team won the English Premier Squash League (PSL) in 2015.
