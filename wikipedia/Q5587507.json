One important argument in favor of the normativity of rationality is based on considerations of praise- and blameworthiness. It states that we usually hold each other responsible for being rational and criticize each other when we fail to do so. This practice indicates that irrationality is some form of fault on the side of the subject that should not be the case. A strong counterexample to this position is due to John Broome, who considers the case of a fish an agent wants to eat. It contains salmonella, which is a decisive reason why the agent ought not to eat it. But the agent is unaware of this fact, which is why it is rational for him to eat the fish. So this would be a case where normativity and rationality come apart. This example can be generalized in the sense that rationality only depends on the reasons accessible to the agent or how things appear to him while what he ought to do is determined by objectively existing reasons. In the ideal case, rationality and normativity may coincide but they come apart either if the agent lacks access to a reason or if he has a mistaken belief about the presence of a reason. These considerations are summed up in the statement that rationality supervenes only on the agent's mind but normativity does not."]}, {"page": "Motivation", "response": ["A closely related issue concerns the relation between what we believe we ought to do, so-called ought-beliefs, and what we are motivated to do or actually intend to do. Philosopher John Broome holds that this relation is at the core of enkratic rationality: \"Rationality requires of you that, if you believe you ought to F, then you intend to F\". He thinks that the process of reasoning is responsible for getting our intentions in line with our ought-beliefs. The requirements of rationality are not always fulfilled, resulting in cases of irrationality. A person is said to suffer from akrasia or weakness of the will if they fail to satisfy the enkratic requirement, i.e. if they do something different from what they believe they should do. An author who believes he ought to work on his new book but ends up watching TV instead is an example of a case of akrasia. Accidie is a closely related phenomenon in which the agent believes that there is something important to be done but lacks any motivation to engage in this action due to listlessness."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* John Broome (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "John Broome", "response": ["John Broome may refer to:", "*John Broome (politician) (1738\u20131810), New York politician", "*John Broome (writer) (1913\u20131999), American writer-contributor to DC comics", "*John Broome (philosopher) (born 1947), British philosopher and economist at the University of Oxford"]}, {"page": "Commensurability (ethics)", "response": ["Finally, a set of philosophers led by John Broome has argued that incomparability is vagueness.
