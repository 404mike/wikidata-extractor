He was the second son of Luke Teeling, a wealthy Catholic linen manufacturer in Lisburn\nAt the age of 16 he joined his elder brother Bartholomew Teeling in the Society of United Irishmen, formed in 1791 by Protestant reformers in Belfast. In defiance of the Ascendancy Parliament in Dublin, and of the Dublin Castle Executive answerable to London, the Society sought \"an equal representation of all the people\" of Ireland in a \"national government.\" With his brother-in-law John Magennis, the Teeling brothers helped connect the United Irishmen with the Defenders.. A vigilante response to Peep O'Day Boy raids upon Catholic homes in the mid 1780s, by the mid 1790s the Defenders, like the United Irishmen, developed into an extensive oath-bound fraternity. He was a witness, he later claimed, not a partisan in their confrontation with the Peep O'Day Boys in the Battle of the Diamond, 1795.\nHis activities with the United Irishmen and Defenders led to his arrest on 16 September 1796, for high treason. He was released on bail the following year, remaining free during and after the 1798 rebellion, in which he was to deny any involvement. He was arrested, and briefly held, again in the wake of Robert Emmet's abortive uprising in 1803, probably due to the involvement of his younger brother George.\nTeeling edited a short-lived monthly, the Ulster Magazine (Belfast, 1830\u201331), and then started or took over a weekly newspaper, the Northern Herald (Belfast), edited partly by Thomas O'Hagan (qv), the future Baron O'Hagan, which survived somewhat longer (1833\u201336). His memoirs of the politics of his youth appeared in three parts: Personal Narrative of the \"Irish Rebellion\" of 1798 (1828), his Sequel to Personal Narrative of the \"Irish Rebellion\" of 1798 (1832), and his History and Consequences of the Battle of the Diamond (1835).\nIn 1835, through the Northern Herald, Teeling helped launch the journalistic career of Charles Gavan Duffy, future Young Irelander and editor of 'The Nation.  \nCharles Hamilton Teeling was said to be \u2018late of Belfast\u2019 when he died on 14 August 1848.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lisburn", "response": ["* Charles Teeling (1778\u20131848) \u2013 United Irishman and journalist"]}, {"page": "Society of United Irishmen", "response": ["With their brother-in-law John Magennis, in 1795 the United Irish brothers, Bartholomew and Charles Teeling, sons of a wealthy Catholic linen manufacturer in Lisburn, appear to have had command over the Down, Antrim and Armagh Defenders. United Irishmen were able to offer practical assistance: legal counsel, aid and refuge. Catholic victims of the Armagh disturbances and of the Battle of the Diamond (at which Charles Teeling had been present)Charles Teeling (1838), History and Consequences of the Battle of the Diamond, Hodgson, Belfast were sheltered on Presbyterian farms in Down and Antrim, and the goodwill earned used to open the Defenders to trusted republicans. Emmet records these as being able to convince Defenders of something they had only \"vaguely\" considered, namely the need to separate Ireland from England and to secure its \"real as well as nominal independence\". ", "Former and potential United Irish members regrouped with previously neglected lower-rank Jacobins and Defenders in a series of \"ephemeral organisation\" (The Philanthropic Society, the Huguenots, the Illuminati, the Druids' Lodges...) used as a cover for their activities in Dublin, but also to spread the movement into the provinces. The authorities came down heavily on the Belfast radicals, with Castlereagh personally supervising the arrests of Neilson, Russell and Charles Teeling in September 1796. But early in 1797 their organising vision prevailed. All the various republican clubs and cover lodges, and much of Defender network, were formally marshalled in a local and provincial delegate-structure under a national United Irish executive in Dublin Among others, the directorate included Thomas Addis Emmet; Richard McCormick, Tone's replacement as secretary to the Catholic Committee; and two disillusioned parliamentary patriots: the future Napoleonic general Arthur O'Connor and the popular Lord Edward Fitzgerald."]}, {"page": "Betsy Gray", "response": ["In addition to MacSkimin, M'Comb's cites at least two other references to Betsy Gray by those who were her contemporaries.
