He founded the International Summer School for flute.The English flautist Trevor Wye  began playing the flute at age 15. Contrary to what might be expected of a famous flautist, Wye did not attend a college of music, nor a conservatory, nor a university, but he later studied with Marcel Moyse whom Wye credits as a major influence on his playing, teaching, and writing career. Wye also studied with flutist Geoffrey Gilbert. He was also influenced by British singer Alfred Deller and flautist William Bennett.\nWye was a freelance orchestral and chamber player in London for many years, and has several solo recordings. He served as a professor at the Guildhall School of Music, London, for fourteen years, and at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, for twenty-two years. The latter school awarded him an honorary degree in 1990.\nPerhaps his best known published works are the six-volumed Practice Books for the Flute, which concentrate on tone, technique, articulation, intonation and vibrato, breathing and scales, and advanced practice. He has also published a series titled A Beginner\u2019s Book for the Flute, a piccolo practice book, and several arrangements for flute and piano. His biography of Marcel Moyse has been published in several languages, and an ongoing collaborative project consists of an encyclopedia of the flute. Another work-in-progress is a short biography of Albert Cooper, flute maker.\nWye teaches in his flute studio in Kent, which is a one-year residential course for postgraduate students established in 1990. He travels the world giving masterclasses and concerts, serves on juries for international competitions, and gives recitals. \nHe is the general editor of a free, on-line flute encyclopedia called The Flute Ark.Wye is married to his first wife, Dot.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marcel Moyse", "response": ["Moyse taught on the faculty of the Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, and was a founder of the Marlboro Music School and festival in Vermont.

She was accepted into the Royal College of Music Junior College, where she took private lessons in each of these three instruments and played in a recorder consort. At age 15, Brown attended the Trevor Wye Summer School which motivated her to further her flute study and she later attended the Royal Northern College of Music to study with Wye. It was here that her interest in baroque flute grew. She also studied baroque flute with Lisa Beznosiuk during her years at RNCM. After graduation, she obtained positions with the Academy of Ancient Music and Kent Opera. In 1984, Brown traveled to the US to compete in the National Flute Association's Young Artist Competition, where she won first place. She credits this competition as helping her find international connections and becoming more connected to the flute community."]}]}}
