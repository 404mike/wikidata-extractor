The following year, the Polaris Sales Agreement allowed Britain to purchase the Polaris missile from the United States, for the purpose of submarine based nuclear deterrent. The highly favourable terms came at a surprise to the British, and it represented a warming of relations which had been troubled in the immediate aftermath of the Suez crisis. In 1968 the first ballistic missile submarine  was commissioned, armed with the new missiles. The Royal Navy later became wholly responsible for the maintenance of the UK's nuclear deterrent. Even so, the Labour government had announced in 1966 that Britain would not mount major operations without the help of allies, and that the existing carrier force would be maintained into the 1970s. Christopher Mayhew and Sir David Luce resigned in protest, but to no avail. Britain withdrew from the east of Suez, cancelling its planned CVA-01 large carrier, and other than Polaris focused on its NATO responsibilities of anti-submarine warfare, defending US Navy carrier groups in the GIUK gap. Polaris-armed submarines patrolled the North Atlantic from 1968 to 1996. The Polaris program was eventually abolished in favour of the newer Trident system."]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Sir David Luce, First Sea Lord", "**Sir David Luce, First Sea Lord", "**Sir David Luce, First Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "Christopher Mayhew", "response": ["When Labour took office in 1964 Mayhew was appointed as Minister of Defence for the Royal Navy.
