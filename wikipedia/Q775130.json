He was also the father of Maud Earl and Percy Earl, and the brother of Thomas Earl, all three of whom were also animal artists.\nEarl was a keen sportsman and this is reflected in his work and reputation as a dog painter.  He was also an early member of The Kennel Club.  Although chiefly remembered as a canine artist due to his success depicting them, of the nineteen paintings Earl exhibited at the Royal Academy (RA) between 1857 and 1883 only a minority was of dogs.", "link_mentions": {}}}
