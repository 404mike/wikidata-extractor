The crown and trolley would be brought on by the normally mute (\"We can't afford to pay you to speak\") Trevor and Nathalie (Trevor Lock and Nathalie Brandon) who would sometimes be dressed in outlandish costumes.

In one sketch per week a disciple would pose a question to Jesus (Lee), usually on a topic of importance that would split Christianity (e.g. Transubstantiation vs Transignification). Instead of answering directly He would make a vague comment (such as instructing them to \"consider the lily\"), pause, then say \"ahh\" in a mysterious manner, causing all but Matthew (Herring) to \"ahh\" along with Him, leading the disciple to become frustrated with the evasion (\"This isn't an 'ahh' situation\"; \"Ahh!\"; \"No, not 'ahh' \u2013 you can't just say 'consider the lily'\"; \"Ahh!\"; \"No Jesus: Not 'ahh'.\")  Peter (Carlton Dixon) would insult Matthew for not understanding, insisting in a smug \"class swot\" manner that he \"got it right away\", and Judas (Eldon) would also laugh at double entendres, only to be admonished.  The other Apostles were played by Paul Putner (\"Doubting Thomas\"), Trevor Lock (Thaddaeus) and TV's Emma Kennedy (the fictional Ian, who only started following Jesus as he misunderstood the phrase \"fishers of men\").
