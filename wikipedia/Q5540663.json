He moved to League side Hearts in 1892 and became a professional the following year, when professionalism was legalised in Scotland. During his time with the Gorgie side he won two League titles, in 1894-95 and 1896-97, and two Scottish Cup winners medals, in 1895-96 and 1900-01.\nAlthough primarily a defensive player, earning the sobriquet \"Tynecastle Warhorse\" as a testament to his power and stamina, he was also capable of playing a more refined game when required. He played twice for the Scottish national team, both times in 1896. He made his debut in a 2\u20131 win against England and also played in a 3\u20133 draw with Ireland. He made one appearance for the Scottish League representative side.Hogg retired after suffering a serious knee injury during the 1903-04 season. He later emigrated to South Africa where he spent the rest of his life.", "link_mentions": {}}}
