He moved to League side Hearts in 1892 and became a professional the following year, when professionalism was legalised in Scotland. During his time with the Gorgie side he won two League titles, in 1894-95 and 1896-97, and two Scottish Cup winners medals, in 1895-96 and 1900-01.\nAlthough primarily a defensive player, earning the sobriquet \"Tynecastle Warhorse\" as a testament to his power and stamina, he was also capable of playing a more refined game when required. He played twice for the Scottish national team, both times in 1896. He made his debut in a 2\u20131 win against England and also played in a 3\u20133 draw with Ireland. He made one appearance for the Scottish League representative side.Hogg retired after suffering a serious knee injury during the 1903-04 season. He later emigrated to South Africa where he spent the rest of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Calder", "response": ["* George Hogg (1869 \u2013 ????), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Heart of Midlothian F.C. players", "response": ["|George Hogg, London Hearts Supporters Club"]}, {"page": "Hogg (surname)", "response": ["* George Hogg (born 1869), Scottish footballer (Heart of Midlothian)", "* George Hogg (adventurer) (1914\u20131945), British adventurer in China"]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|George Hogg"]}, {"page": "George Hogg", "response": ["George Hogg may refer to:", "* George Hogg (adventurer) (1915\u20131945), English adventurer", "* George Hogg (footballer) (1869\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "* George Hogg (priest) (born 1910), Archdeacon of Cashel and Emly"]}, {"page": "1896 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|LH |||| George Hogg"]}, {"page": "1901 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|RH ||||George Hogg"]}, {"page": "1902\u201303 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|LH ||||George Hogg"]}, {"page": "1895 World Championship (football)", "response": ["|MF || || George Hogg"]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 World Championship (football)", "response": ["|LH || ||George Hogg", "|LH || ||George Hogg"]}, {"page": "Mossend Swifts F.C.", "response": ["*  George Hogg"]}]}}
