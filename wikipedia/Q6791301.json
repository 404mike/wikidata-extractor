He was educated at Hawkshead Grammar School (where Wordsworth was a contemporary), (e-published PhD thesis) and then in the lower school of the grammar school in Preston.  He then became a weaver, but at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed for seven years to a printer in Preston. In the fifth year of his apprenticeship, he terminated it and moved to Leeds, where he finished his apprenticeship with the printer of the Leeds Mercury, one of two Leeds weekly newspapers. In later years, both Baines and his political opponents would have it that he arrived in Leeds with little more than the clothes on his back, but on completion of his apprenticeship he set up his own printworks with the aid of a loan of \u00a3100 from his father. He became a member of the Leeds Reasoning Society (a discussion group which eschewed religious or political issues) and of the local subscription library. He became attracted to non-conformism, and after attending the chapels of both Unitarians and Congregationalists settled for the latter (although he did not formally become a member until 1840). (He married Charlotte Talbot in 1798; she and their children were also lifelong non-conformists, with the exception of the eldest son Matthew Talbot Baines who became an Anglican, and therefore was able to take a degree at Cambridge.)", "An elder son, Matthew Talbot Baines (1799\u20131860), went to the bar; he became recorder of Kingston upon Hull in (1837), M.P. for Kingston upon Hull in 1847, president of the Poor Law Board in 1849, was returned as M.P. for Leeds 1852, again became president of the Poor Law Board (until 1855), and entered the cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1856."]}, {"page": "Poor Law Board", "response": ["*Matthew Talbot Baines 1849-1852", "*Matthew Talbot Baines 1852-1855"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1837\u20131901)", "response": ["*Matthew Talbot Baines (1799\u20131860)"]}, {"page": "First Palmerston ministry", "response": ["|Matthew Talbot Baines||7 December 1855", "|rowspan=2|President of the Poor Law Board||Matthew Talbot Baines||30 December 1852||continued in office"]}, {"page": "First Russell ministry", "response": ["|Matthew Talbot Baines||1 January 1849"]}, {"page": "Aberdeen ministry", "response": ["|President of the Poor Law Board||Matthew Talbot Baines||Whig||30 December 1852||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Leeds(two members)||Matthew Talbot Baines||Liberal"]}, {"page": "Baines", "response": ["* Matthew Talbot Baines (1799\u20131860), British lawyer and Liberal politician"]}, {"page": "Talbot Baines Reed", "response": ["Andrew Reed had five sons, the third of whom, Charles Reed (1819\u201381), was apprenticed in 1836 to a wool manufacturer in Leeds, Yorkshire, where he also became secretary of the local Sunday School union.
