The door opens and a seductive woman (Thelma Taylor in the television version, Carol Cleveland in the film version) steps out and lures the milkman in; the milkman looks around, then enters the house. The woman takes the milkman upstairs, smiling at him and beckoning him with her finger. The milkman cautiously follows her as she unlocks her bedroom door. She opens the door and ushers the milkman inside. As the milkman enters the room, she shuts the door and locks it. The milkman looks around the room and sees several milkmen, some of whom are very old, including one who is a skeleton. Ralph Woodward points out that the plot bears a strong resemblance to that of the poem La Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats."]}, {"page": "Fairhaven Singers", "response": ["The Fairhaven Singers is a chamber choir based in Cambridge, UK, directed by Ralph Woodward.
