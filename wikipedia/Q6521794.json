Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show. For some of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge Britain's Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her. Bussell remained a judge alongside Goodman, Tonioli and Horwood until 2018. Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday.", "| Len Goodman", "| rowspan=\"6\" |Len Goodman", "| rowspan=\"3\" |Len Goodman", "| rowspan=\"5\" |Len Goodman", "A new system called the dance-off, which takes place in the results show, was introduced in series 5. It continued until series 7 but was not used for series 8 and 9; it was then reinstated in series 10 and has remained a feature of the show ever since. There are two couples in each dance-off: the two who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges' scores and public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week's competition. Before they attempt their dance a second time, the couple sometimes gets advice from the judges. The judges decide who continues in the competition and who is eliminated based on the dance-off performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be saved, that couple is through to the following week's competition and the Head Judge's vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the Head Judge, originally Len Goodman and currently Shirley Ballas. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance \u2014 sometimes known as \"waltzing out of the ballroom\". The Monday after their elimination, they appear on It Takes Two to discuss their time on the programme. The dance-off has been cancelled only once, in series 14, due to an injury sustained earlier by one of the celebrity contestants, Anastacia. She was unable to perform the dance-off and the couple with the lowest combined total was eliminated.", "The show featured 14 new celebrities, who were paired with 14 professional dancers. In a change to the previous format, the results show was recorded on Saturday and broadcast on Sunday, rather than shown live later on Saturday. In addition to this, the two couples who were at the bottom of the table after the public vote were subject to a dance-off, where they reprised their routine for the judges to decide who should leave the competition. Head Judge Len Goodman had the casting vote in the event of a tie. The series raised just over one million pounds for Children in Need.", "All of series eight's judges returned to the show.
