It was decided that Stanley should remain unmarried, and Lady Amberley assured her sister that their parents and siblings needed her at home. Described by Lady Amberley's son Bertrand Russell as \"stern and gloomy Aunt Maude\", Stanley doted on her siblings' numerous children.

In his will, Amberley had named Douglas Spalding and T. J. Cobden-Sanderson as Frank and Bertrand's guardians, not wishing his children to be raised as Christians, but Lord and Lady Russell successfully contested the stipulation and assumed full guardianship of their grandsons. The deeply pious Lady Russell, notwithstanding her undoubted disapproval of some of its content, made sure that her son's book An Analysis of Religious Belief (which took a critical view of Christianity and other religions) was published a month after his death. Two years later Earl Russell died, leaving Lady Russell as Frank and Bertrand's sole guardian. In later life Bertrand Russell recalled his grandmother as: \"the most important person to me throughout my childhood. She was a Scotch Presbyterian, Liberal in politics and religion...but extremely strict in matters of morality.\" "]}]}}
