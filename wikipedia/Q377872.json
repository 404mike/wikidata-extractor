He played 69 Wartime League and Cup games for Stoke, and also made 87 guest appearances for Blackpool. In addition to these, he also played a handful of games for Scottish sides Airdrieonians, Morton and Rangers, where he collected a Charity Cup winners' medal, and also played for Arsenal against FC Dynamo Moscow in extremely thick fog. He also played 29 times for England, though no caps were awarded as these were unofficial games.

However following the appointement of Freddie Steele in December 1951, Sproson was dropped in favour of the experienced Stan Palk. Sproson won his place back in March 1952 and held on to his shirt for many years. Steele worked to develop the famous 'Iron Curtain' defence, as the Vale defence conceded just 35 times in 46 games in 1952\u201353. Only Second Division Huddersfield Town conceded fewer, though Vale still finished one point behind Oldham Athletic."]}]}}
