Since their inception in 1990, they have released 13  studio albums, three EPs, one demo, one box set, four compilation albums, one live album, and one live CD/DVD release.\nAlong with Anathema and Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride were a forerunner of the death doom metal and gothic metal genres during the early 1990s. These bands comprise \"The Peaceville Three\" as all were signed to Peaceville Records at the time.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evanescence", "response": ["Critics vary in terming Evanescence a rock or metal band, but most identify them as some form of gothic band. Publications such as The New York Times, Rough Guides and Rolling Stone have identified Evanescence as a gothic metal act, while other sources such as IGN, Spin and NME have termed them gothic rock. They have been compared to a variety of bands from differing genres, such as nu metal ensembles like Linkin Park, gothic metal groups like Lacuna Coil, and symphonic metal acts like Nightwish and Within Temptation. David Browne of Blender offers an elaborate description of the band's music as \"goth Christian n\u00fc-metal with a twist of melancholic Enya.\" Adrien Begrand of PopMatters describes Evanescence's guitar riffs to be similar to nu metal. Adrian Jackson of My Dying Bride stated that he feels Evanescence is doing something similar to his own gothic metal group, only in a more commercial direction. Other genres and influences used to describe the band's sound include industrial rock, alternative metal, hard rock, alternative rock, post-grunge, and progressive metal. Evanescence cite Pantera, Bj\u00f6rk, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Danny Elfman, Tori Amos, Nirvana, Portishead, Massive Attack, Nine Inch Nails, Garbage, Joan Jett, and Plumb as influences."]}, {"page": "My Dying Bride", "response": ["My Dying Bride was formed in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, in June 1990, after guitarist Andrew Craighan and drummer Rick Miah co-formed the band after they had split from Abiosis, joining vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe and guitarist Calvin Robertshaw while ending Abiosis. After six months of rehearsing, the band recorded and released their demo, Towards the Sinister, which was produced by Tim Walker of Voltage Records. Its title was taken from a line in the song \"Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium\". The band then released their first single, \"God Is Alone\", on a small French label called Listenable. After the single had sold out almost immediately, they were picked up by Peaceville Records, and they could release their first EP, Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium, which also featured their latest recruit, bassist Adrian Jackson.
