In spite of his staunch conservative views on economic policy, his passionate support of increased British integration into the European Union led to him becoming increasingly marginalised in Thatcher's Conservative Party.\nAfter being deselected as a Conservative parliamentary candidate for the 1992 general election, Meyer became policy director of the European Movement, and in 1998 he joined the Pro-Euro Conservative Party.  After that disbanded in 2001, he became a member of the Liberal Democrats.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: M", "response": ["*Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet (1964\u20131966), (1970\u20131992)"]}, {"page": "Anthony John Charles Meyer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir Anthony John Charles Meyer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir Anthony Meyer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet"]}]}}
