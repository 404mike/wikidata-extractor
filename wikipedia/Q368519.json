He was a pioneering figure in the field of modern fantasy literature and the mentor of fellow writer Lewis Carroll. In addition to his fairy tales, MacDonald wrote several works of Christian theology, including several collections of sermons.\nHis writings have been cited as a major literary influence by many notable authors including  Lewis Carroll, W. H. Auden, David Lindsay, J. M. Barrie, Lord Dunsany, Elizabeth Yates, Oswald Chambers, Mark Twain, Hope Mirrlees, Robert E. Howard, L. Frank Baum, T.H. White, Richard Adams, Lloyd Alexander, Hilaire Belloc, G.K. Chesterton, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Walter de la Mare, E. Nesbit, Peter S. Beagle, Neil Gaiman and Madeleine L'Engle.C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his \"master\": \"Picking up a copy of Phantastes one day at a train-station bookstall, I began to read. A few hours later\", said Lewis, \"I knew that I had crossed a great frontier.\" G. K. Chesterton cited The Princess and the Goblin as a book that had \"made a difference to my whole existence\".Elizabeth Yates wrote of Sir Gibbie, \"It moved me the way books did when, as a child, the great gates of literature began to open and first encounters with noble thoughts and utterances were unspeakably thrilling.\"Even Mark Twain, who initially disliked MacDonald, became friends with him, and there is some evidence that Twain was influenced by him. The Christian author Oswald Chambers wrote in his \"Christian Disciplines\" that \"it is a striking indication of the trend and shallowness of the modern reading public that George MacDonald's books have been so neglected\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
