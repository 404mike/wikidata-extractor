The first three were against teams battling relegation and the Gulls took full advantage, grabbing maximum points against struggling Stockport, Barnet and Burton Albion.  These matches saw Paul Buckle begin to experiment with his squad selection with second choice keeper Danny Potter being brought in to give Scott Bevan a well-deserved break and left back Lathaniel Rowe-Turner deputising for the ever-present Kevin Nicholson.  Both players rewarded the manager's faith with Potter keeping clean sheets in his first three games and Rowe-Turner scoring on his first league start of the season against Barnet.

In the 55th minute, Zebroski was shown the first yellow card of the match for foul on Roberts.  Three minutes later, Stevenage made the first substitution of the match, with Darren Murphy replacing Byrom.  Soon after, Mousinho was booked for time-wasting before Harrison was brought on by Stevenage as a substitute for Reid who had injured his hamstring.  Charles then saw his low shot saved by Bevan before Zebroski's shot following an error from Roberts hit the side netting.  Jake Robinson's  strike was saved by Day and then Zebroski shot over the Stevenage bar.  Murphy's close-range header went wide of the Torquay United goal before Robinson's shot hit the Stevenage crossbar.  In the 79th minute, Joe Oastler came on to replace Damon Lathrope and was booked a minute later for a foul on Harrison.  Three minutes later, Branston's initial shot from a Stevenage corner was blocked and he struck the rebound over the bar from around .  With seven minutes of regular time remaining, Torquay United made a double-substitution, with Danny Stevens and Lathaniel Rowe-Turner coming on for Robinson and Nicholson.
