He played as a centre back.\nFox was born in the Sheldon district of Birmingham. When he left school in 1987, he joined Birmingham City as a YTS trainee, and turned professional two years later. Fox, described as a \"dogged defender, hard in the tackle and quick to cover\", made his debut in the Second Division on 25 February 1989, deputising for Vince Overson in the starting eleven for a goalless draw away at West Bromwich Albion. He played twice more in the league that season, and then missed the entire 1989\u201390 season through injury. He played seven times in the league in 1990, then spent a month on loan at Cheltenham Town of the Conference, but was unable to establish himself in the first team on his return. He joined Division Two (third tier) club Northampton Town towards the end of the 1992\u201393 season, but played only once before being released. After an unsuccessful trial with Shrewsbury Town, he moved into non-league football with Bridgnorth Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matthew Fox (disambiguation)", "response": ["Matthew Fox (born 1966) is an American actor.", "Matthew Fox may also refer to:", "* Matthew Fox (footballer) (born 1971), English football defender with Birmingham City and Northampton Town", "* Matthew Fox (priest) (born 1940), American Episcopalian (formerly Roman Catholic) priest and author", "* Matthew Fox (author), Canadian author and magazine editor"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Matthew Fox"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Matthew Fox"]}]}}
