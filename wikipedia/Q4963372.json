The latter two advances are described as having taken stained glass as an artform to its zero-point in each direction: absolute transparency, and, conversely, complete opacity.A lifelong exponent of the integration of art and architecture, his architectural collaborations include work with Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster, Arata Isozaki, Oscar Niemeyer, I. M. Pei, C\u00e9sar Pelli and Renzo Piano. He served a 7-year term as chairman of The Architecture Foundation, and served on the Design Review Committee of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. His artistic collaborations have included work with David Bailey, Hugh Hudson, Malcolm McLaren, Linda McCartney, Paul McCartney and Ivor Abrahams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank", "response": ["In 1981, Foster received a commission for the construction of a new terminal building at London's Stansted Airport.

As part of the project's development, in 1988 Foster and British artist Brian Clarke made several proposals for an integral stained glass artwork for the terminal building; the principal proposal would have seen the walls of the terminal's east and west elevations clad in two sequences of traditionally mouth-blown, leaded glass. For complex technical and security reasons, the original scheme, which Clarke considered to be his magnum opus, couldn't be executed. Though unrealised, the collaboration is historically significant for its scale, its introduction of colour and materials broadly viewed as antithetical to high-tech architecture into a key work of that movement, and for having been the first time in the history of stained glass that computer-assisted design had been utilised in the creative process."]}, {"page": "London Stansted Airport", "response": ["The current terminal building was designed by architectural practice Foster + Partners, commissioned in 1981.
