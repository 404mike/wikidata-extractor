The car itself was based on a composite of two cars: Fleming's own  Standard Tourer, which he had driven in Switzerland in the late 1920s, and Chitty Bang Bang, a chain-driven customised Mercedes with a 23-litre 6-cylinder Maybach aero-engine. Fleming had seen the car's owner, Louis Zborowski race at the Brooklands race track. The origin of the name \"Chitty Bang Bang\" is disputed, but may also have been inspired by early aeronautical engineer Letitia Chitty. Like Zborowski, Fleming names his car because of the noise it made\u2014and the noise a car made was important to Fleming."]}, {"page": "Joseph William Chitty", "response": ["Grandchildren included Letitia Chitty (1897 \u2013 1982) a structural analytical engineer who became the first female fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society."]}, {"page": "Newnham College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Letitia Chitty"]}, {"page": "Anne Ridler", "response": ["Ridler was the daughter of Henry Bradby, housemaster at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England, where she was born.
