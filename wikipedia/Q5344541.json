Born in London on 21 January 1797, his parents managed a pub and often left Edward to his own devices playing in the street. Speaking of these childhood years he once said, \"So ignorant was I that I did not know that there was a God.\" He was finally exposed to the Christian gospel and was baptised the age of 18. He was trained as a cabinet maker and worked in London for 37 years. Only in his 50s did he enter the ministry and was pastor at Rehoboth Baptist Church in Horsham, West Sussex for 26 years. He was well liked by the congregation in Horsham and they offered him the church building as a gift. Mote replied \"I do not want the chapel, I only want the pulpit; and when I cease to preach Christ, then turn me out of that.\" He died on 13 November 1874 and is buried in the church yard at Rehoboth Church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Parables of Jesus", "response": ["Similarly, \"My Hope Is Built\" (Edward Mote, c. 1834) is inspired by the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders, and \"How Kind the Good Samaritan\" (John Newton, c. 1779) is inspired by the parable of the Good Samaritan."]}, {"page": "Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders", "response": ["This parable has formed the theme for many hymns, such as Built on the Rock (N.

These publications generated vast amounts of income for the church and for John, most of which he passed to missions and friendly societies in his travels. His career was well followed in the press as he travelled around the countryside preaching to any that would listen, especially those congregations in the chapels set up by Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon during The Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, a small society of evangelical churches founded in 1783 and strongly associated with the Calvinist Methodist movement of George Whitefield. Hyatt was greatly involved with charitable societies, often being seen at meetings of the London Missionary Society and seamen's missions along the Thames. He is also to be found in Dublin in 1821, preaching there and in more than 40 other towns and villages in the north of Ireland. Over the next few years he is to be found preaching in Kent, Wiltshire, Bristol, Northampton, York and many other places that wanted to hear his renowned sermons. He was very well respected, and influenced the likes of Edward Mote, who wrote more than one hundred hymns published in his book, \"Hymns of Praise (London, 1836).
