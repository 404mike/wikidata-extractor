Born in London on 21 January 1797, his parents managed a pub and often left Edward to his own devices playing in the street. Speaking of these childhood years he once said, \"So ignorant was I that I did not know that there was a God.\" He was finally exposed to the Christian gospel and was baptised the age of 18. He was trained as a cabinet maker and worked in London for 37 years. Only in his 50s did he enter the ministry and was pastor at Rehoboth Baptist Church in Horsham, West Sussex for 26 years. He was well liked by the congregation in Horsham and they offered him the church building as a gift. Mote replied \"I do not want the chapel, I only want the pulpit; and when I cease to preach Christ, then turn me out of that.\" He died on 13 November 1874 and is buried in the church yard at Rehoboth Church.", "link_mentions": {}}}
