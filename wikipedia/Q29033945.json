He was born in Calcutta; died in Eastbourne. Guise was a right-handed batsman and a right arm medium pace bowler who played in 94 first-class matches. He scored 3,775 career runs with a highest score of 154* and, as a fielder, held 53 catches. He took 63 wickets with a best analysis of four for 19.In his 1992 Wisden obituary, Guise is described as one of \"the select few who have achieved fame through one big performance\". In a 1921 public schools match when he was 17, Guise made a record score of 278 for Winchester College against Eton College at Agar's Plough. Wisden recorded that Winchester had been bowled out for 57 in their first innings on a rain-affected pitch. Eton, batting in better conditions, had taken a lead of 198. At close of play, Winchester in their second innings had made 130 for 3 with opening batsman Guise on 86 not out. On the second day, he \"farmed the bowling like a veteran\" to score 278 before being run out. Winchester had made 381, which left Eton needing 184 to win; they did so, by seven wickets. After Winchester, Guise went up to Brasenose College, Oxford. His brother, James, also played first-class cricket.\nGuise was a schoolteacher by profession, teaching at Winchester, Adams Grammar School in Shropshire and Helston Grammar School in Cornwall between 1927 and 1964. Guise resigned from Helston Grammar due to an incident regarding corporal punishment being administered to two students in his office, for which Guise was fined \u00a350.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* John Guise (1923\u20131932) : J.

He was educated at Winchester College, where he played for the college cricket team as a wicket-keeper. He was present in the match against Eton College in 1920, when John Guise scored 278 runs. From Winchester he went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, he played first-class cricket for Cambridge University Cricket Club in 1923, making two appearances against Middlesex at Fenner's and the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. He had success against Middlesex, scoring 61 not out in a 120 runs stand for the ninth wicket with Gubby Allen. He did not gain a blue, with his appearances for the university limited due to the presence of wicket-keeper's Dar Lyon and Noel Sherwell in the Cambridge team. After graduating from Cambridge, Huband went into education. He was for many years the headmaster of Lockers Park School in England, where amongst his pupils was the Nawab of Pataudi, who captained India in Test cricket during the 1960s and 1970s. Huband died at Lambeth in November 1964."]}]}}
