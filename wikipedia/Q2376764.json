The labourers soon discovered the entrance to the tomb within the mound, and a Welsh antiquarian named Edward Lhwyd, who was staying in the area, was alerted and took an interest in the monument. He wrote an account of the mound and its tomb, describing what he saw as its \"barbarous sculpture\" and noting that animal bones, beads, and pieces of glass had been found inside of it (modern archaeologists have speculated that these latter two were in fact the polished pottery beads that subsequently have been found at the site and that were a common feature of Neolithic tombs).O'Kelly (1982:24) Soon another antiquarian visitor, Sir Thomas Molyneaux, professor at the University of Dublin, also came to the site.

The Canterbury Congress occasioned the dispute which led to a split and the formation of the Arch\u00e6ological Institute (AI).

This infuriated Oxford publisher John Henry Parker, who was to have been the publisher of the official proceedings. Behind the scenes, however, the dispute had other dimensions, both social (all the founders of the BAA were 'trade', the seceding members of the AI considered themselves to be socially superior) and religious (the Oxford Chronicle of 16 August 1845 suggested that the dispute had acquired Tractarian/anti-Tractarian overtones)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Wright", "response": ["Thomas Wright may refer to:", "* Thomas Wright (writer) (fl. 1604), English writer", "* Thomas Wright (engraver) (1792\u20131849), British engraver and portrait painter", "* Thomas Wright (antiquarian) (1810\u20131877), British antiquarian and writer", "* Thomas Wright (social commentator) (1839\u20131909), English social commentator", "* Thomas Wright (Lord Mayor) (died 1798), Lord Mayor of London in 1785", "* Thomas Wright (astronomer) (1711\u20131786), English astronomer and mathematician", "* Thomas Wright (geologist) (1809\u20131884), Scottish surgeon and paleontologist", "* Thomas Wright (cricketer, born 1842) (1842\u2013?), English cricketer", "* Thomas Wright (cricketer, born 1900) (1900\u20131962), English cricketer", "* Thomas Wright (rugby) (1924\u20131990), Scottish rugby union and rugby league player", "* Thomas Wright (controversialist) (died 1624), English Roman Catholic priest and controversialist", "* Thomas Wright (philanthropist) (1789\u20131875), British prison philanthropist"]}, {"page": "William of Rubruck", "response": ["The Latin text of an incomplete manuscript containing only the first 26 chapters, together with an English translation by Richard Hakluyt was published in 1599.
