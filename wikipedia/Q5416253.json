One motion, signed by five MPs, deplored \"the tendency, evident in recent British Broadcasting Corporation television programmes, notably on Sunday evenings, to pander to sexual and sadistic tastes\".The MPs were Kenneth Thompson, Eveline Hill, Dudley Williams, William Steward and Austen Hudson (all Conservative).   An amendment was tabled which sought to make the motion now deplore \"the tendency of honourable members to attack the courage and enterprise of the British Broadcasting Corporation in presenting plays and programmes capable of appreciation by adult minds, on Sunday evenings and other occasions.\" It was signed by five MPs.The MPs were Arthur Palmer, Maurice Edelman, Leslie Plummer Anthony Greenwood (all Labour) and Beverley Baxter (Conservative). (As for the last citation: The Times, 15 December 1954) Another amendment added \"but is thankful that the freedom of the individual still permits viewers to switch off and, due to the foresight of her Majesty's Government, will soon permit a switch-over to be made to more appropriate programmes.\"Tabled by Charles Taylor, Walter Robert Dempster Perkins (both Conservatives) and others (as before). A second motion signed by six MPs, applauded \"the sincere attempts of the BBC. to bring home to the British people the logical and soul-destroying consequences of the surrender of their freedom\" and calling attention to the fact that \"many of the inhuman practices depicted in the play Nineteen Eighty-Four are already in common use under totalitarian r\u00e9gimes.\",Signed by Harry Legge-Bourke and five other Conservatives (as before).

In September 1955, four days before the school was due to open, the Minister of Education, Sir David Eccles, intervened to stop the comprehensive plan. Instead he approved the original plan of the Poundswick Grammar School for 750 children, and a secondary modern school at Oldwood (which the council wanted to combine into a comprehensive on two sites), and two single sex technical schools at West Wythenshawe (which the council wanted to combine into a single comprehensive). The Minister said he would approve comprehensive plans 'as an experiment where favourable conditions exist'. As would be found later, favourable conditions did not exist in Wythenshawe. The Minister thought the council's plans were too rudimentary, uneconomic, not thought-through (especially two sites for a school being half a mile apart) and a little rushed and ill-conceived. The council was resolute in opening the school as a two-site comprehensive in September 1955, claiming it was just too late for the plans to be reversed. Eveline Hill was the local Conservative MP."]}, {"page": "Lucy Powell", "response": ["Powell was elected at the Manchester Central by-election held in November 2012.
