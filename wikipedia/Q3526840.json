His weight gain, combined with a congenital heart abnormality, resulted in a fatal heart attack at the age of 41, whilst on a summer walking holiday in Chamb\u00e9ry, France. According to a number of sources (including Herbert Strudwick), he had been in good health and spirits before leaving England. A widespread rumour that he had committed suicide was disproved by research carried out by Ralph Barker.Ralph Barker, Ten Great Bowlers, Chatto and Windus, 1967, pp123-126.

He made eight catches and one remarkable stumping off Foster and took the rising, spinning bowling of Sydney Barnes better than any other 'keeper before or since. 1912 saw the ill-fated Triangular Tournament, but the summer was so wet that English cricket in 1911 and 1912 was quite literally two different ball games. Warwickshire unsurprisingly declined to mid-table, but Smith maintained his form so well in 1913 with a personal high 68 dismissals that he was chosen for the South African tour. However, he lost his place to Strudwick after one Test and never regained his England place as Strudwick and Arthur Dolphin overtook him."]}, {"page": "Alf Gover", "response": ["Alf Gover was born in Epsom, Surrey in 1908. A fast right-hand bowler with a deadly outswinger and a cleverly disguised breakback, Gover began bowling at a young age and was first taken on trial by Essex in July 1926. He bowled Johnny Douglas at the nets several times and travelled with Essex as twelfth man to The Oval in 1927. A chance conversation with Herbert Strudwick, the great Surrey wicket-keeper, led Gover to changing county because he thought his prospects would be brighter with Surrey."]}, {"page": "Australian Imperial Force Touring XI", "response": ["As advertised in the poster, Mitcham hoped to include Jack Hobbs, Andy Sandham and Herbert Strudwick but none of these took part on the day. Mitcham's sixteen was bolstered by the inclusion of three guest players, one of them Bill Stirling. The other two were Surrey wicketkeeper Dennis Sullivan, who was born in Mitcham, and amateur Burnett Bullock, who was \"mine host\" at the public house opposite the ground that now bears his name. Mitcham batted first and scored 200 all out, their captain Howard Lacey making the top score with 39. Trenerry and Collins shared twelve of the fifteen wickets while Gregory was bowled sparingly. The AIF included a couple of players from their second eleven but they won easily by five wickets, though Stirling took the wickets of Murray and Docker cheaply."]}, {"page": "1911 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five Members of the MCC's Team in Australia) \u2013 Frank Foster, J W Hearne, Sep Kinneir, Phil Mead, Herbert Strudwick "]}, {"page": "Trevor Molony", "response": ["Molony took one wicket in his next match against Leicestershire, Albert Lord being caught by the Surrey wicket-keeper Herbert Strudwick who \"had to catch it or be almost decapitated\".

Herbert Strudwick, the Surrey wicket-keeper, worked in a South London munitions plant alongside team mate Razor Smith.

However Herbert Strudwick then usurped his regular position in the side, and he appeared infrequently thereafter. After the 1908 season he emigrated to Ireland, where he worked as a groundsman at the Woodbrook Cricket Club Ground in Bray. He played in four fixtures on the ground which are rated as first-class, one in 1909 and three in 1912. One of the 1912 games was for Ireland against the touring South Africans. He had also appeared in two games for London County, one in 1900 and one in 1903. He stood as umpire in a single first-class match, Surrey against the touring Philadelphians in 1908.", "He was run down and killed by a train from Bray near Woodbrook station in Dublin. Stedman was crossing the railway line when he was struck. Ironically, he was noted for protecting his chest with a copy of the South Western Railway timetable when keeping wicket.Lemmon, David, The History of Surrey County Cricket Club, Christopher Helm, 1989, , p114.

Meanwhile, the Surrey fielders repeatedly fumbled the ball before eventually wicket-keeper Herbert Strudwick managed to remove the bails.

His 551 catches and 127 stumpings were a county record until beaten by Roger Tolchard, and his keeping skill made him a rival of incumbent national keeper Herbert Strudwick though Sidwell was never selected for England. Two of his three centuries came in the 1928 season where he hit 1,153 runs, and he batted in both the lower and top order."]}, {"page": "Ham and Petersham Cricket Club", "response": ["Some famous cricketers have graced the field on Ham Common, including Shane Warne,This is London, June 2012 Imran Khan,Richmond and Twickenham Times, July 2007 Gary Sobers, Tom Richardson, Jack Hobbs, Andy Sandham, Herbert Strudwick, Peter May, Alec Bedser and Bill Brockwell.

The selectors initially asked Herbert Strudwick to take over on the grounds of seniority but he declined so they turned to Hobbs. Although Hobbs expected Greville Stevens, the only amateur remaining in the team, to take over, he became the first professional to captain England at home. The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically as captain, although Carr did not approve. Hobbs scored 74 in England's innings, but heavy rain on the first day had ensured a fourth successive draw in the series.McKinstry, pp. 275\u201378."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Merton", "response": ["*Herbert Strudwick \u2013 cricket wicket-keeper"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who have taken two five-wicket hauls on Test debut", "response": ["*Herbert Strudwick"]}]}}
