A procession ended with a mock coronation of Stanhope under the arch of Palmyra as \"queen of the desert\". William Ware, fascinated by Zenobia, wrote a fanciful account of her life.

As Austen's style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using less dialogue. While directing, Michell avoided what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other 19th-century depictions, and discouraged his actors from wearing make-up or appearing too hygienic. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne produced clothing that appeared \"lived-in\", which won her a BAFTA. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming. It was filmed during a period of popularity for Austen's works produced in the mid-1990s.", "The idea for a film version of the 1817 Austen novel Persuasion began with the English producer Fiona Finlay, who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years.

There's something very touching about long-lost love\".

Dear first suggested they try one of Austen's other works\u2014either Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice\u2014but agreed to adapt Persuasion after reading it.
