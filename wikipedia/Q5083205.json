By the end of July it was clear that the continent was on the brink of hostilities, with Wilson being lobbied by Milner and the diplomat Eyre Crowe about Edward Grey's reluctance to go to war. Wilson (1 August) called on de la Panouse (French Military Attach\u00e9) and Paul Cambon (French Ambassador) to discuss the military situation.Jeffery 2006, pp. 131\u20132. Wilson may well have been keeping the Conservative leadership informed of discussions between Cambon and Foreign Secretary Grey.Clark 2012, p. 541.Clark gives no specific cite for this claim, which appears just before a discussion of how Grey, following a Cabinet meeting at which John Morley and the neutralists had had the upper hand, told Cambon (1 August) that Britain would probably stay out. The same day, Conservative MP George Lloyd then had a meeting with Cambon, who told him that Grey was \u2013 there was a hung Parliament at the time \u2013 using alleged lack of Conservative support as an excuse for Britain staying out. That evening there were meetings of leading Conservatives, and the following day (2 August), a letter to the Government urging them to fight.

He intended to create six army corps, three of which would be composed of permanent standing formations that consisted of the army's regulars. They would be ready for immediate dispatch in light of an imperial crisis or in the event of European war. In 1902, three corps were formed that would allow up to nine divisions, each of two brigades, to be created. This included the 2nd Division formed on 1 April 1902, under the command of Major-General Charles Douglas. The division consisted of the 3rd and the 4th Brigades, and was based in Aldershot. The division was part of the 1st Army Corps, of only two divisions (the 3rd Division would be mobilised in the event of war)., , , and  In 1907, the Haldane Reforms further restructured the regular army into six infantry divisions, each with three brigades. These would form the basis of any British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that would be dispatched to Europe in the case of war. This included the 2nd Division, which then consisted of the 4th (Guards), the 5th, and the 6th Brigades. The 1st and the 2nd Divisions were allocated to Aldershot Command, a military district based at Aldershot. On the outbreak of war, Aldershot Command would form the nucleus of a new I Corps, which would then be dispatched with the BEF. The 2nd Division took part in the Army Manoeuvres of 1912 and 1913."]}]}}
