Success followed at Paris and in the third Ghent Floralies. The Board of Trade were impressed with this record and offered \u00a310,000 for promotions at the Valenciennes Festival but they were required to give this money to a trade organisation. Roy approached the National Farmers Union and the Horticultural Traders Association, neither of whom were interested. This led to David Bowes-Lyon instructing Roy to set up a brand new organisation. Thus was born the Federation of British Horticultural Exporters which then had seven members, and now has 110 member firms and is now known as Gardenex.
