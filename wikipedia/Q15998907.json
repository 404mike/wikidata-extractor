Osborne was one of seven new caps, four of whom joined Osborne in a much changed pack. Although lacking international experience many of the players winning their first caps that day went on to form the nucleus of the Wales team that beat The Original All Blacks in 1905, including Arthur Harding, Will Joseph, and fellow collier Dai \"Tarw\" Jones. In a very close encounter, Osbourne scored his one and only international try on his d\u00e9but; Wales then won the game through a late penalty goal from John Strand-Jones. Osborne was then reselected to face Scotland in the second game of the series, played on Welsh home soil at the Cardiff Arms Park. The Scottish Rugby Union stated that they would refuse to face Wales if Osborne played, as there were rumours that he had accepted and signed a professional contract with a rugby league team. This was illegal under rugby union rules, which was a purely amateur sport. Osborne was forced to make a full statement denying the claim, and the match went ahead with Osborne in the Welsh pack.Jenkins (1991), pg 121. The only change to the Welsh team from the previous match was Harry Jones coming in for Lanelli's Nathaniel Walters, and the more fluent Welsh play resulted in a victory over a very gifted Scottish team.Godwin (1987), pg 66. The final game of the tournament for Wales saw an unchanged team beat Ireland at Lansdowne Road to win the Championship and the Triple Crown for the third time."]}, {"page": "Harry Jones (rugby union, born 1878)", "response": ["Although little is recorded about Jones, he is listed as originally playing rugby for Porth Scarlets a now defunct Rhondda club.Jenkins (1991), pg 87. By the time he was selected to represent Wales in 1902, he was playing club rugby for Penygraig RFC, a more successful valley club that had supplied several players to the international squad since 1896. The 1902 Championship had already begun, with Wales victorious over England in their opening fixture, when Jones was called in as a replacement for Llanelli's Nathaniel Walters. Jones' first game was a home match against reigning Home Nations Champions Scotland. Although Scotland were favourites to win, a fluent Welsh team won the game comfortably, scoring four tries to Scotland's one. After this victory the Welsh selectors kept faith with the side, refusing to make a single change for the final game of the tournament, away to Ireland. Wales beat Ireland 15-0, and lifted their third Championship and Triple Crown titles. Despite now being a Championship winner and never playing in a losing game, Jones was replaced the next season by George Travers, and never represented Wales again."]}, {"page": "Daniel Walters", "response": ["*Nathaniel Walters (1875\u20131956), commonly known as Danny Walters, rugby player"]}]}}
