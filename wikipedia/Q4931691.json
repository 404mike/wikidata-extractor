Likened to former Liverpool full back Chris Lawler his goalscoring prowess also earned him the nickname \"The Ghost\" from Preston manager McGrath due to his ability to appear almost unnoticed at the far post to score, something that soon became his trademark. He was also an ever-present in both the 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390 seasons, finishing runner-up in the club's official player of the year awards on both occasions to Bob Atkins and Warren Joyce respectively. In all, Swann played 250 first team games for Preston, scoring 47 goals, quite an achievement in a side that generally hovered around the wrong end of the league table."]}, {"page": "Preston North End F.C.

Used mainly as a substitute in his first few months with the club, he played more regularly later in the season and helped the club to a mid-table position. The following season, Preston adopted a three-man defensive line, with Wrightson playing alongside Bob Atkins and Adrian Hughes; they reached the end-of-season playoffs only to lose to eventual winners Port Vale."]}]}}
