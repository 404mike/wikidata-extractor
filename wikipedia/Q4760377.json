Kettering took the lead in the first half before Gillingham scored twice.  Despite being forced to substitute their goalkeeper due to an injury before half-time, with former Gillingham midfielder Ian Docker taking over in goal, the Conference team levelled the scores in the second half and nearly held on for a draw.  Forster scored a winner in the 85th minute, however, meaning that Gillingham progressed past the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in five seasons.  In the second round their opponents were fellow Third Division team Colchester United.  The initial match, at Priestfield, resulted in a 1\u20131 draw, necessitating a replay at Layer Road in Colchester.  Gillingham won the replay 3\u20132 with goals from Forster, Andy Arnott and Henry.  The Premier League and First Division teams entered the competition in the third round, but Gillingham were paired with Huddersfield Town of the Second Division.  The initial match at Priestfield ended in a goalless draw, meaning another replay.  Gillingham lost 2\u20131 in the replay at Leeds Road and were eliminated from the competition."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["Gillingham's first match was at home to Hartlepool United and resulted in a goalless draw.  Foster made his debut, but had to be substituted after injuring his ankle.  Although he was able to continue playing for two weeks, the injury then recurred and kept him out of the team until November.  He scored his first goal for the team in the second league match of the season, a 3\u20130 victory away to Wigan Athletic; this was Gillingham's biggest win away from home for more than three years.  The team extended their unbeaten run from the start of the season to three games with a 1\u20131 draw at home to Rochdale but then lost away games against Scunthorpe United and Exeter City.  In Foster's absence, Andy Arnott was brought into the starting line-up against Scunthorpe for the first time since the opening game of the season, but neither he nor fellow forward Paul Baker was able to score in either game, with both finishing 3\u20130 to Gillingham's opponents.  In response to the lack of goals, Flanagan signed Scottish forward Paul Ritchie on loan from Dundee.  It was the second loan spell at Priestfield Stadium for Ritchie, who had played six Third Division games for Gillingham in 1993.  He scored on his second debut for Gillingham to help the team to a 3\u20131 win at home to Scarborough on 10 September."]}]}}
