His run was ended by a leg injury, which saw him miss the rest of Brentford's 1962\u201363 Fourth Division title-winning season. Cakebread returned to action for the club's record 9\u20130 win over Wrexham on 15 October 1963, replacing Fred Ryecraft in the lineup. After a run of five games, he lost his place to Chic Brodie and made just one further appearance during the 1963\u201364 season. He played what would be his final game for the club in 2\u20132 draw with West London rivals Queens Park Rangers on 20 March 1964. Cakebread dropped into the reserves for the 1964\u201365 season and won the London Challenge Cup with the team. He departed Griffin Park in June 1965, having made 374 appearances, a total which places him eighth on the club's all-time list.

The ever-changing structure of the game in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the Brentford reserve team included in leagues competing against the first teams of amateur clubs. On occasion, the reserve team would compete in two leagues simultaneously. Upon the Football League's acceptance of the Premier League's Elite Player Performance Plan in 2011, which replaced reserve teams with U21 Development Squads, the reserve team was permanently disbanded. Winger Micky Ball made the most appearances for the reserve team, 159, without having ever made a first team appearance.
