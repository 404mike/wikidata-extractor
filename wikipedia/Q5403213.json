Henry Wood. She was educated at Bedford High School and Newnham College, Cambridge (1891\u201395), graduating in natural sciences.\nIn 1896, she became assistant to Charles Lapworth at Mason College (which later became the University of Birmingham), and began the preparation of her best-known work, British Graptolites, with her college friend Gertrude Elles. She was particularly responsible for the illustrations. This monograph was to become a standard palaeontological reference work for many years. She published a number of other works and was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1919. In 1920, she received the Murchison Medal for her work on the monograph.In 1906, she earned her DSc from the University of Birmingham, and shortly afterwards married Gilbert Arden Shakespear, a physics lecturer at the university whom she had met in Cambridge. They had only one child, a daughter, but she died in infancy. During the First World War she devoted herself to helping disabled servicemen. She was honorary secretary of the Birmingham War Pensions Committee and from 1917 to 1926 sat on the Special Grants Committee of the Ministry of Pensions. She was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Birmingham in 1922, specialising in cases involving children and working-class girls. She was a family visitor for foster parents and invited many poor women and girls to stay in her home at Caldwell Hall, Upton Warren, Worcestershire.Shakespear was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1918 for her war work and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours.She died of cancer in 1946, aged 74.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shakespear", "response": ["* Ethel Shakespear (1871\u20131946), English geologist, public servant and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Mason Science College", "response": ["* Dame Ethel Shakespear, geologist, public servant and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Bedford High School, Bedfordshire", "response": ["*Ethel Shakespear, geologist"]}, {"page": "Lapworth Museum of Geology", "response": ["The Museum collection contains over 250,000 specimens of fossils, rocks and minerals, as well as geological maps, equipment, models, and photographic material, and also zoological specimens and stone axes. Also housed in the Museum is the Lapworth Archive, a detailed and extensive archive of Charles Lapworth's work that represents one of the most complete archives of any 19th century geologist, as well as important archives relating to other significant 19th and 20th century geologists such as Professor L. J. Wills and Professor Fred Shotton. Archival material also documents the time spent at the University of Birmingham by the Chinese geologist Li Siguang, as well as the work of pioneering female scientists such as Dame Maria Ogilvie Gordon and Dame Ethel Shakespear. In 2008 the entire collection of the Lapworth was officially designated as of outstanding national and international importance by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and subsequently by Arts Council England. The Lapworth is also accredited by Arts Council England. The significance of the Lapworth's collections to the scientific community is recognised by funding through the HEFCE Museums, Galleries and Collections Fund. In 2009, the Earth Science collection of the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery was relocated to the Lapworth Museum as a long term loan."]}, {"page": "Women in geology", "response": ["* Ethel Shakespear - English geologist"]}, {"page": "List of Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*1920: Georgiana Buller, Clara Butt, Alice Chisholm, The Countess of Eglinton, The Countess of Gosford, Catherine Hunt, The Countess of Leicester, The Baroness Melchett, Beryl Oliver, Ethel Pearson, Una Pope-Hennessy, The Viscountess Rhondda, Louise Samuel, Ethel Shakespear, The Baroness Talbot of Malahide, Meriel Talbot, Catherine Wingate, Sophia Wintz"]}, {"page": "List of University of Birmingham alumni", "response": ["* Ethel Shakespear, geologist (DSc 1906)"]}, {"page": "Ethel Mary Reader Shakespear", "response": ["#Redirect Ethel Shakespear"]}, {"page": "Ethel Mary Reader Wood", "response": ["#Redirect Ethel Shakespear"]}, {"page": "Ethel Wood", "response": ["* Ethel Shakespear (1871\u20131946), n\u00e9e Wood, English geologist, public servant and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Ethel Shakespeare", "response": ["#Redirect Ethel Shakespear"]}, {"page": "Index of women scientists articles", "response": ["*Ethel Shakespear"]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* Ethel Shakespear (England, 1871-1946)"]}, {"page": "Margaret Crosfield", "response": ["This money helped independently fund Margret\u2019s research and further her studies at Cambridge.
