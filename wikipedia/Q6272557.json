He also claimed that Foster tried to \"cleanse the records\" by hiding her involvement in delaying the scheme's closure.

As details of the scheme were released to the public, Foster came under increasing pressure because she was the minister who had initially conceived it.  She apologised for the lack of cost control, but accused Bell of prolonging the scheme's closure.  In response Bell gave an interview to The Nolan Show, broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland.  In it he accused the DUP's special advisers of trying to compel him to keep the scheme open. He claimed that they were not allowing time to close the scheme at its peak.  He named Timothy Johnston, special adviser to then First Minister Peter Robinson, and Andrew Crawford, one of Foster's aides.  Bell accused Foster publicly of trying to \"cleanse records\" to remove evidence of her interference.  He also called for a public inquiry into the matter.", "Jonathan Bell, the previous DETI Minister, revealed in the Assembly on 16 January 2017 under assembly privilege that Timothy Johnston and John Robinson, two DUP special advisers, had extensive interests in the poultry industry which is why he could not reduce the RHI tariff."]}]}}
