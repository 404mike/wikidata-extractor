And the season after, an even greater triumph: Arsenal's first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England record. This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 1972\u201373."]}, {"page": "October 12", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 Don Howe, English footballer and manager (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "West Bromwich Albion F.C.", "response": ["The club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972\u201373,McOwan p. 105. but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager Johnny Giles.McOwan pp. 113\u2013114.
