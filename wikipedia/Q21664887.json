The estate, then named \"Macquarie Fields\", was purchased by Samuel Terry in 1831. Terry added to the estate which remained in the Terry family until 1877. At this time the land was subdivided with the largest land parcel, which later contained part of the Defence site, being purchased by James Ashcroft. Subsequently, the intact estate was purchased by member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Alexander Ross in 1904 and was subdivided into two land parcels in 1917. The parcel which later contained the Defence site remained in the Ross family and was purchased by Frederick Moore in 1927. Moore added land to the estate and then subdivided it into a mix of small town allotments, small farm allotments and larger parcels of about 100 acres. By 1939 only a few of the allotments had been sold off.(Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd, Hoxton Park Recycled Water Scheme October 2008)"]}, {"page": "Ivanhoe Park cultural landscape", "response": ["On 5 June 1933 a match at Manly Oval between Victoria and NSW was won by Victoria 14\u20138, its first victory over NSW in NSW.
