Stockford broke his back in a skiing accident in 1985. He competed using a monoski \u2013 a specially fitted chair over a single ski that includes seat belts and other strapping, as well as a suspension device to minimise wear and tear on the skier's body.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1992 Winter Paralympics", "response": ["The British team entered athletes in all three disciplines contested at the Games; eleven in alpine skiing, four in biathlon and three in cross-country skiing. Five medals were won by British athletes, one silver and four bronze, meaning Britain placed fifteenth in the medal table. This remains Great Britain's second best Winter Paralympic medal total after the 1984 Winter Paralympics in Innsbruck, Austria, where the team won ten medals. All five medals were won in alpine skiing events, two by Richard Burt and three by Matthew Stockford. In addition to the medal performances the team had fourteen top ten finishes.  The achievements of the British Paralympic team at the 1992 Winter Games helped to raise awareness of sports for disabled athletes.", "Eleven British alpine skiers took part in the Games, ten in the men's events and one in the women's. All five of Britain's medals at the Games were won in alpine skiing events. The team's only silver medal was won by Richard Burt in the giant slalom B3 classification and he also won a bronze in the super-G B3. Burt almost missed his silver medal run when race officials started prematurely resetting the slalom course, but Burt's sighted guide Keith Hockley noticed and took him up the mountain to complete the race. Matthew Stockford, the reigning world champion in downhill, won three bronze medals in the downhill, super-G and giant slalom events of the LW10 classification. After Stockford won the bronze in downhill, the British delegation filed a protest claiming that the two American skiers ahead of him should not have been in the LW10 category. The medical committee rejected the protest on the grounds that all classifications had been determined at the start of the competition.  Both Burt and Stockford would go on to win medals at the 1994 Winter Paralympics in Lillehammer.", "|rowspan=4|Matthew Stockford"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1994 Winter Paralympics", "response": ["Eight British athletes competed in alpine skiing events, a decrease from the eleven who had competed in the 1992 Games. Six of the athletes had previous Games experience. A total of four bronze medals were won by British skiers. Richard Burt medalled in both the giant slalom and super-G B3 classification, as he had done in 1992.
