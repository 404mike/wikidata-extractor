He was one of the Team TrackCycling.co.uk members in 2005, who were part funded by the launch of a coffee brand by Magnus B\u00e4ckstedt.In 2007, Jones was the Youth British National Champion in both the sprint and 500 m time trial events. He became the first ever winner of the prestigious White Hope Sprint at Herne Hill Velodrome's Good Friday meeting to hold an under 16 championship title at the same time. He also went on to win the Ron Beckett scratch race the same day. He was described as having \"prodigious sprinting talent\" by Gerry McManus, a Cycling News reporter. Jones stepped up a category to compete against the Juniors in 2008, and succeeded in adding the Junior sprint champion title to his list.Many were surprised in Autumn 2007 when Jones was controversially left off the team roster for British Cycling's Olympic Development Programme.\n Currently number one in Wales for his age group, Jones has since been included in the development squad for the 2012 Summer Olympics.Jones will be competed at the European Track Championships in Poland in September 2008, where he won a silver medal as part of the junior team sprint squad.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2008 UEC European Track Championships", "response": ["|Steven HillLuc JonesPeter Mitchell||46.435"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2008 UEC European Track Championships", "response": ["| || Steven HillLuc JonesPeter Mitchell || Junior Men's Team Sprint", "|align=left|Luc Jones", "|align=left|Steven HillLuc JonesPeter Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Luc Jones (rugby union)", "response": ["For the Welsh cyclist see Luc Jones", "Luc Jones (born 12 May 1994) is a Welsh rugby union player who has recently played for Jersey Reds in the RFU Championship as a scrum half.
