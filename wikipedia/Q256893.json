In May 1996, Diana visited Lahore upon invitation of Imran Khan, a relative of Hasnat Khan, and visited the latter's family in secret. Khan was intensely private and the relationship was conducted in secrecy, with Diana lying to members of the press who questioned her about it. Their relationship lasted almost two years with differing accounts of who ended it. She is said to have spoken of her distress when he ended their relationship. However, according to Khan's testimony at the inquest into her death, it was Diana who ended their relationship in the summer of 1997. Burrell also said the relationship was ended by Diana in July 1997. Burrell also claimed that Diana's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, disapproved of her daughter's relationship with a Muslim man. By the time of Diana's death in 1997, she had not spoken to her mother in four months. By contrast, her relationship with her estranged stepmother had reportedly improved."]}, {"page": "Seil", "response": ["Frances Shand Kydd, the mother of Diana, Princess of Wales lived on the island for many years until her death in 2004."]}, {"page": "Frances Ruth Burke-Roche", "response": ["#redirect Frances Shand Kydd"]}, {"page": "2004 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 3 June \u2013 Frances Shand Kydd, mother of Diana, Princess of Wales and grandmother of Princes William and Harry (born 1936)"]}, {"page": "Songs of Praise", "response": ["The show has included interviews with Tony Blair, Frances Shand Kydd, Alan Ayckbourn and members of the British Royal Family."]}, {"page": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer", "response": ["* The obituaries for the 8th Earl Spencer, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Frances Shand Kydd in The Times."]}, {"page": "List of converts to Catholicism", "response": ["* Frances Shand Kydd: mother of Diana, Princess of Wales"]}, {"page": "Rona Anderson", "response": ["In October 1958, she played Mary Tufnell in Once a Rake at the Theatre Royal, Windsor.
