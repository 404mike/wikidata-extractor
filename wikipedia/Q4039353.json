He is mainly noted for his elaborate fully custom  guitar pedalboard systems.  He has worked for Paul McCartney, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, The Who's Pete Townshend, Lou Reed, Tony Iommi, Brian May, Mark Knopfler (as well directing some Dire Straits videos), The Police's Andy Summers, and many others.Cornish has been described as \"the inventor of the pedalboard\" and a key figure in the transition from single effects to the development of multi-effects units.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Effects unit", "response": ["Some boutique pedal manufacturers include: BJFE, Pete Cornish, Emlyn Crowther, Death By Audio, Robert Keeley, Roger Linn, Roger Mayer, Strymon, T-Rex Engineering, ToadWorks and Z.Vex Effects."]}, {"page": "Brian May", "response": ["May also customises his amps by removing the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal). This alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137\u00a0dB. He always used a treble booster which, along with the AC30 and his custom 'Deacy Amp' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones. He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to A Day at the Races. Effects designer Pete Cornish built for him the TB-83 (32\u00a0dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83."]}, {"page": "Pete Townshend", "response": ["In 2006 Townshend had a pedalboard designed by long-time gear guru Pete Cornish. The board apparently comprises a compressor, an old Boss OD-1 overdrive pedal, as well as a T-Rex Replica delay pedal."]}, {"page": "Andy Summers", "response": ["\"I created it sort of out of necessity; my mission was 'We\u2019re going to play for two hours each night as a trio,' so I wanted to have this fantastic, coloured guitar sound that was different for every song. So, I used the Echoplex, then a chorus, and a few other pedals\u2026envelope filters. As we went on, I acquired more stuff and got a Pete Cornish board. But what was driving it was to invade and push the edge of what the guitar was supposed to sound like, and make it really interesting over a show. So, it wasn\u2019t just one straight sound all the time. I could move it around. And it was appreciated by many millions of people (laughs). Of course, it\u2019s very tired and a bit 'retro' now; I\u2019m not very keen on it anymore. But in those days it was new, fresh, and exciting.\""]}, {"page": "The Australian Pink Floyd Show", "response": ["The band is noted for replicating the nuances of Pink Floyd's work.
