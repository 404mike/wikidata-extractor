This resulted in a glut of riders and Harry was loaned to Coatbridge and Teesside.\nAt the end of 1975, Harry Bastable and Tony Allsopp, promoters at Stoke, moved the licence to Oxford for 1976, filling the void left by the move of Oxford Rebels to White City Stadium. 1976 saw Maclean missing a lot of matches through injury and not getting rides, so he asked to be transferred, being taken in by Teesside Tigers for the 1977 season. When that season finished, Ron Wilson, Teesside's promoter, took Maclean to Milton Keynes, a new track.\nThe end of 1979 saw a swap deal agreed, with Maclean going to Edinburgh Monarchs and Bert Harkins going to Milton Keynes Knights.\nMaclean retired from speedway in 1983.\nSince retirement from speedway, he worked as an Accountant (never qualified, but had been doing accounts, even while riding), helping other riders in particular with their tax returns.\nReturning to Scotland, he worked in an Accountant's office for a couple of years then invested in an engineering company. When that business was sold, went into the window cleaning business.\nHe took up golf at age of 37, winning loads of competitions including the club senior championship. including the Annual Speedway Riders Cup three times, held at John Harrhy's golf course - the West Midland Golf Club.\nA qualified scuba diver to the level of PADI Advanced, diving all over the world.\nLives in Gullane, his home for twenty eight years.
