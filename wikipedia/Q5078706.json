After attending Harrow School, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and under James Hannen, Baron Hannen at Lincoln's Inn.\nHe was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 17 November 1866, and built up a large practice in the Admiralty court and the south-east of England, becoming a Queen's Counsel in 1881. He was made a Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1884.From 1877 he was attorney-general to the Prince of Wales, and he apparently was a great favourite with the Prince and his wife. In May 1890, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for acting as the British representative at an international conference on maritime law held in Washington, D.C., the previous year.In the 1885 United Kingdom general election he was returned as Conservative Member of Parliament for the Chesterton division of Cambridgeshire. After his defeat in the 1892 general election, he was elected at a by-election in August 1892 for the Holborn division of Finsbury. He was not a frequent speaker in Parliament.In 1892 he was appointed Recorder of London, an office which could be combined with being in Parliament, but not with a court position (thus he resigned as attorney-general to the Prince of Wales). A contemporary newspaper obituary has the following on his time as recorder:\n\nThe late Recorder has fully justified his appointment. His sentences have, perhaps, at times been unduly severe, but he has been courteous and patient, and little criticism has been passed on his judicial conduct.\nHe was appointed as a Privy Councillor in 1899, and died in office on 9 March 1900.He never married, and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1837\u20131901)", "response": ["*Sir Charles Hall (1843\u20131900)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Charles Hall"]}, {"page": "Charles Hall", "response": ["Charles Hall may refer to:", "* Charles Hall (economist) (1740\u20131825), British economist, physician, and early socialist", "* Charles Hall Grandgent (1862\u20131939), American philologist and scholar", "* Charles Hall (vice-chancellor) (1814\u20131883), English barrister and judge", "* Charles Hall (American football) (1875\u20131945), American football coach in the United States", "* Charles Hall (athlete) (1887\u20131972), American Olympic athlete", "* Charles Hall (cricketer, born 1842) (1842\u2013?), English cricketer", "* Charles Hall (cricketer, born 1848) (1848\u20131931), English cricketer", "* Charles Hall (cricketer, born 1906) (1906\u20131976), English first-class cricketer", "* Charles Hall (racing driver) (born 1979), British race car driver", "* Charles Hall (1690\u20131743), MP for Lincoln 1727\u20131734", "* Charles Hall (Australian politician) (1851\u20131922), member of the Tasmanian Parliament", "* Charles Hall Dillon (1853\u20131929), House of Representatives member from South Dakota", "* Charles Hall (Holborn MP) (1843\u20131900), MP for Holborn, 1892\u20131900", "* Charles Hall (MP for Lincolnshire) (died 1669), English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1654 and 1656", "* Charles Hall (New Zealand politician) (1843\u20131937), New Zealand politician", "* Charles Hall (Wisconsin politician) (1847\u20131909), Wisconsin politician"]}, {"page": "Cleveland Street scandal", "response": ["Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society gossip about his sex life continued.

The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated.\"Lees-Milne, p. 231 In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers.
