Butterbur appears in both Ralph Bakshi's animated 1978 adaptation of The Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson's film, but in both adaptations most of his scenes are cut. Alan Tilvern voiced Butterbur (credited as \"Innkeeper\") in the animated film, while David Weatherley played him in Jackson's epic. A character credited as \"Butterbur, Sr\" appears briefly during the prologue of Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, portrayed by Richard Whiteside.

The first Chief Whip, Vic Gould, was played by Edward Jewesbury in two episodes of Yes Minister.Opening episode, \"Open Government\", broadcast on 25 February 1980 Gould was initially intended to be a more prominent character in the series, as the writers thought he would continually force Hacker to pursue policies unappealing to Sir Humphrey, and thus lead to greater conflict.  They quickly found that Gould's character was largely unnecessary, and that the Hacker/Sir Humphrey conflicts worked just as well without him. In \"Party Games\", a later Chief Whip, played by James Grout and identified as \"Jeffrey\", conspires with Sir Humphrey to ensure that Hacker becomes Prime Minister. In 2 episodes of Yes, Prime Minister, Jeffrey is now played by Peter Cartwright. (In the novelizations, the character is given the full name of Jeffrey Pearson.)

Both of the latter were written into the 1998 series by Hamilton when the run of Donkey ended that year. The majority of the guest and recurring actors also had roles in Drop the Dead Donkey, including Jasper Jacob (series one), Philip Pope (recurring), Nick Revell (recurring), Nigel Pegram, Penelope Nice (Deborah Whittingham, before being replaced by Felicity Montagu) and Geoffrey Whitehead (Roland).", "The first four series centred on the philosophical arguments between Satan and the somewhat idealistic main human character known as \"The Professor\" (played by James Grout). The Professor represents the undeserving damned, being a man of high moral virtue and having been consigned to Hell only on the technicality that he did not believe in God. The character was originally called Professor Richard Whittingham, although in series 2 he is referred to as Professor Richard Hope, when in episodes 5 & 6 Satan gets his book The Theory of Everything published. Generally, Satan seeks to prove to the Professor that mankind is inherently base or flawed, with the Professor taking the opposing position. Usually Satan travels to the living world to display the more contemptible sides of human nature, such as snipers shooting old ladies in Bosnia or prostitution in Thailand, to a generally horrified Professor. At other times he introduces the Professor to historical personages the Professor holds in high esteem but who are now languishing in Hell, such as Leonardo da Vinci, William Shakespeare and Jane Austen, showing him how petty and mendacious they really are. However, the Professor's idealism is usually shown to have some validity as well, and more often than not he wins the argument (although Satan always insists he hasn't).", "Also in 2012, Andy Hamilton proposed a transfer of the show to television.
