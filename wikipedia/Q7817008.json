However, the club were knocked out of the first round of League Cup against League Two opposition for the third season in a row against Shrewsbury Town. Derby maintained their top 2 position in September, with the main highlight being a 2\u20131 win at local rivals Nottingham Forest, despite the fact that goalkeeper Frank Fielding gave away a penalty and was sent off after 67 seconds, Jeff Hendrick's winner in the game was his first goal in senior football. October and November were disappointing with Derby picking up only 1 win and 5 points out of a possible 30 as Derby fell to 15th place in the league, with a 4\u20130 defeat at rivals Leicester City at the start of the month, starting the slump in form. In mid-October, Nigel Clough and his backroom staff signed new -year contracts. Derby picked up form in December and January, losing only twice in 9 games, picking up 17 points as Derby ended the month 12th peaking at 8th in mid-January. February was another disappointing month, where they picked up on 1 point, scoring no goals with them club suffering their 2nd 4\u20130 defeat of the season to the hands of Southampton by the end of the month, Derby were 15th in the table. From the start of April to mid march, Derby picked up 14 points out a possible 21 which lifted Derby to 11th in the table, 5 points off the play-offs with 4 games remaining, Derby manager Nigel Clough however ruled out a play-off place, wishing there was more the 4 games left as the club were showing great form. However defeats to Middlesbrough and Cardiff City in 4 days ended the Derby's play-off chances. Derby finished the season 12th in the league, 11 points off the play-off players, with Nigel Clough being satisfied with the performances of the team, stating a lack of firepower as the reason why they fell short and a target to improve in 2012\u201313. Derby ended the season with a win and a draw as they finished in 12th place on 64 points, 7 places and 15 points better off than the previous season, the club's first top half finish since promotion in 2007 and best league standing since relegation in 2008. Derby's summer signings had mixed fortunes with Craig Bryson, Jason Shackell & Frank Fielding all being in contention for the Player of the Year award. Striker Theo Robinson was joint top scorer with Steve Davies on 12 goals and Jamie Ward's form impressed enough to earn him a new contract. Tom Naylor also earned praise from Nigel Clough for his development and impressed when standing in for John Brayford at right-back. Nathan Tyson, signed from local rivals Forest however failed to score in 24 appearances, Chris Maguire struggled to break into the first team and was loaned out to Portsmouth for the final two months of the season. Chris Riggott rejoined the club on a one-year contract, but was released in December due to injuries. The club relied less on loan signings and more on the club's academy as Jeff Hendrick, Mark O'Brien, Callum Ball, Mason Bennett and Will Hughes all broke into the first team, Bennett and Hughes making their debuts with Bennett setting a club record for youngest ever team player, making his first appearance against Middlesbrough on 22 October 2011 at 15 years and 99 days old, beating Lee Holmes' record by 169 days. The club's reserve side had a less successful year than in the two previous seasons, with the club missing out on the Central League title by one point from Sheffield United, as well as being beaten in the Derbyshire Senior Cup final by Buxton. Derby also reached the final of the Central League Cup final against Manchester City Elite Development squad. The club recorded an average attendance of 26,020, 3 down previous campaign but still the third highest in the Championship behind West Ham United and Southampton. This was also the 14th best average attendance in the country, higher than the average gate of eight Premier League clubs. In October 2011, Derby County announced that they had submitted plans to Derby City Council for a \u00a37 million development of land outside the stadium, which the club named \"The Plaza @ Pride Park\". The plans included five cafes/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of office space. The plans were scaled down from the planned \u00a320 million pound development proposed in 2007. Derby County CEO Tom Glick, said that the plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations, due to be introduced in the Football League from 2012, as revenue from the Plaza was intended to be reinvested back into the club. The planned development also coincided with plans from the City Council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed Plaza.

Prior to the game, Clough also spoke of his desire for patience and his commitment to bringing through youth at Derby. Reflecting on Clough's comments, the Derby Evening Telegraph stated \"The conveyor belt at Derby has juddered and stalled at times and in many ways it has been rusted by constant changes within the Academy set up\" before highlighting past academy-graduates England international Tom Huddlestone, Northern Ireland international Lee Camp, Wales international Lewin Nyatanga and England U21 internationals Lee Grant, Giles Barnes and Lee Holmes (all of whom were no longer with the club) as examples that the current youth set-up should aim to emulate. As if to prove that Derby's youth production was back on track, academy graduate Mark O'Brien, who had played in every game of the new season despite being just 18 years old, signed a new four-year contract, extending his stay at the club until the summer of 2015. On the same day, winger Dave Martin joined Walsall on a months loan and the following week Stephen Bywater moved to Sheffield Wednesday until the end of the year with goalkeeping coach Martin Taylor saying of Bywater \"He's not in the squad at all. Nothing against Stephen because he's worked really hard but he doesn't figure in our plans. At his age he just needs to play games and get in the shop window.\" There was also a link with Mansfield Town's Tom Naylor, who played for the reserves in a bid to earn a contract offer from the club, and Clough laughed off West Bromwich Albion's rumoured \u00a33m interest in John Brayford, saying \"Is that all, \u00a33million?\"", "During the international break Derby added to the squad, with the loan signing of Mansfield Town defender Tom Naylor and trials for defender Daniel Lafferty and forward Edwin Gyasi. The first game after the break, at home to Hull City, also saw the return to the squad of Shaun Barker, Paul Green and John Brayford., though it was not enough to prevent The Rams crash to their third straight defeat as the visitors ran out 2\u20130 winners. The result meant Derby had won just one of the last 9 fixtures, slumping from 2nd to 9th in the table, though Clough dismissed the poor form as \"not a concern\". The game also saw top-scorer Theo Robinson go off with a hamstring injury in the first 15 minutes, an injury which saw the club begin to scour the loan market for a replacement striker ahead of the emergency loan window's closure the following Thursday.", "With the opening of the transfer window, Derby made permanent Tom Naylor's loan move from Mansfield Town on a three-year deal, and signed Sunderland striker Ryan Noble on a month's loan for a second time; Noble having also had a loan spell at the club in the previous campaign.

These were the only three incoming transfers, though several players left the club; Dave Martin joined Southend United for an undisclosed fee and Stephen Pearson and Dean Leacock both had their contracts terminated by mutual consent, allowing them to join Bristol City and Leyton Orient respectively. Tomasz Cywka saw a transfer back to Poland fall through (which later turned out to be Ekstraklasa leaders \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw), with Clough indicating that the player could leave as his contract was up in the summer and there was no intention of offering him a new deal.
