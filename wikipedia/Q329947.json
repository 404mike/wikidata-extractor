He was the third son of Henry Bathurst, Bishop of Norwich. His sister was the poet Caroline de Crespigny.Bathurst disappeared on or about 25 November 1809, sparking much debate and speculation about his ultimate fate, especially in science fiction stories, based on a widespread belief (fostered by secondary sources) that his disappearance was a case of particularly sudden, perhaps supernatural, vanishing. Recent research suggests the circumstances of Bathurst's disappearance were wildly embellished, and that he was almost certainly murdered.", "link_mentions": {}}}
