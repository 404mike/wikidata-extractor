Hasdell is considered by many to be a pioneer of mixed martial arts in the United Kingdom, particularly in the 1990s, when he drove a great deal of innovation in the field. Hasdell promoted the first professional mixed martial arts events in the UK and helped develop many of the standards within the British MMA scene of today.Hasdell began his professional career in 1989, as a Muay Thai boxer, becoming a three-time British champion in kickboxing and Thai boxing. In 1995, he became one of the first British fighters to compete in K-1 and soon began crossing over into mixed martial arts as a shootfighter. In 1996, he won the inaugural Oktagon challenge, an eight-man shootboxing tournament held in Milan, Italy. Then in 1997, he made his debut for Fighting Network RINGS in Japan and would go on to have the majority of his fights there until 2001. His final mixed martial arts bout was in 2007, on the UK promotion Cage Rage. Hasdell's professional and competitive career spanned over 20 years with almost 100 bouts in kickboxing, mixed martial arts and submission grappling.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Milton Keynes", "response": ["* Lee Hasdell, professional Mixed martial artist and Kickboxer"]}, {"page": "Mirko Cro Cop", "response": ["| 1997-10 || Win ||align=left|  Lee Hasdell || Kickboxing Tournament Prague 1997 Quarter Finals || Prague, Czech Republic || TKO (Doctor Stoppage) || 2 || N/A || 2\u20131"]}, {"page": "M\u00e1rio Sperry", "response": ["| Lee Hasdell"]}, {"page": "List of male mixed martial artists", "response": ["*  Lee Hasdell - (RINGS, Cage Rage)"]}, {"page": "List of male kickboxers", "response": ["* Lee Hasdell "]}, {"page": "Fighting Network Rings", "response": ["* United Kingdom \u2013 Lee Hasdell, Chris Watts, Dexter Casey and Paul Cahoon."]}, {"page": "Gilbert Yvel", "response": ["In the following years Yvel came to be considered the best Dutch Heavyweight fighter active on the European fighting circuit. He got a victory over teammate Valentijn Overeem by TKO, as well as a high level one over RINGS England chief Lee Hasdell. In April 1999, Yvel was finally called to Japan by RINGS, where he fought Tsuyoshi Kohsaka. Through the match, Yvel left himself behind by five points due to multiple fouls, which included grabbing the ropes, hitting the face on the ground, striking against an opponent on the knees and, in spectacular fashion, hanging himself off the turnbuckle in order to land a knee to the face. However, he rallied over in points with a palm strike and a tight guillotine choke, and finally won the match when it was stopped due to accumulated damage to Kohsaka's face. He then would fly back to Holland in order to face Semmy Schilt in an interpromotional match.

Han resumed using unorthodox ground and pound from the knee-on-stomach position every time the fight hit the ground, but it was in a standing segment where he got the finish, overpowering the British kickboxer with combinations and injuring Hasdell's eye for a TKO victory. In the second round, Volk fought Bobby Hoffman, who came to the bout with a 23\u20134 record.
