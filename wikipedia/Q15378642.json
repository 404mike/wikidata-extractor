He was born in Clayton-le-Moors and died in Newport, Monmouthshire. He appeared in 38 first-class matches as a righthanded batsman who bowled right arm medium pace and off breaks. He scored 1,292 runs with a highest score of 105 among two centuries and took sixteen wickets with a best performance of four for 25.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Glamorgan never had a settled team and there were a number of new arrivals at the end of the season including Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.Playfair, pp. 97\u201398."]}, {"page": "Arthur Porter", "response": ["Arthur Porter may refer to:", "*Arthur Porter (MP) (died 1559), English politician during the 16th century", "*Arthur Porter (engineer) (1910\u20132010), British-Canadian engineer and computer pioneer", "*Arthur Porter (cricketer) (1914\u20131994), English cricketer", "*Arthur Porter (historian) (1924\u20132019), Creole professor and author", "*W.
