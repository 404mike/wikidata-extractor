Simels describes the lyrics as \u201cfrankly melodramatic [\u2026] declaimed (in the verses) more often than sung\u201d. But Simels gives up trying to pigeonhole the record with, \u201cLet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s excellent music and let it go at that.\u201d Jon Pareles, writing for Creem says Flash and the Pan\u2019s songs are \u201cincorrigibly catchy\u201d but he earlier notes the detachment of the vocal style and the insincerity of lyrics; like Simels, he counters his own criticism, saying, \u201c[If] You want sincerity, go watch Merv Griffin.\u201d Simon Frith in Melody Maker factors the experience of Vanda & Young into the album\u2019s \u201cpop mastery, [which is] evident in the hooks, the minor chords, the insidious orchestrations\u201d. When Frith goes on to express doubts about the \u201cbland monotone\u201d of the vocals, saying that it \u201cadds to the joke, but I\u2019m not sure it adds to the pleasure\u201d, he later adds, \u201cBut then I\u2019m still listening to this LP, and Vanda and Young may be cleverer than I think, and make easy listening out of this robotic sound\"."]}]}}
