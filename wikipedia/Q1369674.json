An example is this problem composed by British composer Thomas Rayner Dawson. In the position in the diagram, Black had decided to resign (although it wasn't his turn). White advised his opponent not to give up so quickly. \"But I am bound to lose, and there is nothing I\u2014or you, for that matter\u2014can do\", said Black. But White insisted: \"I'll bet you $100 that I can lose!\" So the two made the bet and White actually lost. He did not resign, lose on time, or anything like that. How did he lose? The solution is in the words (i.e. it is a riddle): White did not lose the game (which is impossible in the diagram position, as the only legal moves are 1.g7+ Qxg7+ 2.hxg7#), but rather the bet."]}, {"page": "Thomas R.

To the right is a serieshelpmate in seventeen by Thomas Rayner Dawson (published in Fairy Chess Review, 1947). An effective way to solve long serieshelpmates such as this is to envisage a position in which Black could be checkmated, and then to work out how such a problem could be reached. Here, with just one knight, the only way to checkmate Black is to have the black king in the corner and another black piece on a2, allowing Nb3 giving mate. It might seem there are many ways to do this, but the need to avoid exposing the white king to check means that there is only one. The piece on a2 has to be a rook, since if it is a queen or bishop, it would cover the b3 square, and if it was a knight, it would check the king. The black king needs to walk half-way over the board to avoid the newborn rook giving check and then back to a1.

The puzzle was posed as involving opposed rows of pawns separated by a single rank.  Although the puzzle is not posed as an impartial game, the assumption that captures are mandatory implies that a player's moving in any file results only in the removal of that file and its neighbors (if any) from further consideration, with the opposite player to move.  Modeling this as a heap of n tokens, a player may remove an entire heap of one, two, or three tokens, may reduce any heap by two or three tokens, or may split a heap into two parts after removing three tokens.
