They claimed that the airline received $80m in cash and kind in the 25 years since the airline was established and this was substantially lower than what other national carriers had received. Maurice Flanagan also claimed that Emirates incurred social costs of around $600m in 2009 and this included municipal taxes to the city of Dubai. The airline also paid a dividend of AED956m ($260m) in 2010, compared to AED2.9bn ($793m) in 2009 and each year the Government has received at least $100m in dividends."]}, {"page": "Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum", "response": ["Through the 1970s, as well as his role as head of Dubai Defence Force and UAE Minister of Defence, Al Maktoum oversaw Dubai's energy resources and was in charge of Dubai Civil Aviation. It was in this latter role, in March 1985, that he founded Emirates Airline, tasking then-head of DNATA, Maurice Flanagan, with launching a new airline to be called Emirates after a dispute with Gulf Air over Dubai's 'Open Skies' policy. The launch budget of the airline was $10 million (the amount Flanagan said he needed to launch an airline) and its inaugural flight took place on 25 October 1985. Al Maktoum made his (younger) uncle, Ahmed bin Saeed, chairman of the new company. A further $75 million in facilities and materials was provided, but Emirates has always maintained it has received no further subsidies throughout the company's meteoric growth to become one of the world's leading airlines."]}, {"page": "Lymm High School", "response": ["*Maurice Flanagan - founding CEO of the Emirates airlineManchester Evening News article on his CBE award"]}, {"page": "The Emirates Group", "response": ["During the mid-1980s, Gulf Air began to cut back it services to Dubai.

It also leased a new Boeing 737-300 from Pakistan International Airlines which was returned in 1987. Maurice Flanagan was named managing director of the new airline.

He would be joined at the airline by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum (as chairman) and now-Emirates president Tim Clark. Current chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum has since inherited the role of CEO. During its first year, it carried about 260,000 passengers and 10,000 tons of freight.
