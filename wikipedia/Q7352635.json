He was educated at Harrow School and Magdalene College, Cambridge.Marlar played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, winning a blue in 1951, 1952 and 1953 (when he captained Cambridge to victory over Oxford), and for Sussex between 1951 and 1968. An innovative off-break bowler, he took 970 wickets in 289 matches at an average of 25.22, with a personal best of 9/46 against Lancashire at Hove in 1955. He was a \"shrewd and skilful\" captain of Sussex between 1955 and 1959. He remains one of only five native-born cricketers to hold this post.\nHe had a successful journalistic career as an outspoken cricket correspondent of The Sunday Times, and wrote the illustrated history The Story of Cricket (1979).Marlar stood as a Conservative candidate for Bolsover in the 1959 General Election, and in a 1962 by-election at Leicester North East. Decades later he was a candidate at the 1993 Newbury by-election. He was appointed as the President of Sussex County Cricket Club for 2005 and President of MCC for 2005-06. During this time he incurred some controversy when, on a declaration to the Sunday Telegraph, he described it as \"absolutely outrageous\" that female athletes play cricket with male athletes, in response to Holly Colvin and Sarah Taylor, who had both played for England, being chosen to play for Brighton College's First XI that summer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Series Cricket", "response": ["A largely unknown Kerry Packer arrived in London in late May 1977.Haigh (1993), p 67. He appeared on David Frost's The Frost Programme to debate his concept with commentators Jim Laker and Robin Marlar. Marlar's aggressive, indignant interrogation of Packer came unstuck when Packer proved to be articulate, witty, and confident that his vision was the way of the future.McFarline (1977), p 33. The show significantly raised Packer's profile and converted some to his way of thinking. The main goal of his trip was to meet the game's authorities and reach some type of compromise. He made a canny move by securing Richie Benaud as a consultant. Benaud's standing in the game and his journalistic background helped steer Packer through the politics of the game."]}, {"page": "Charles Fry", "response": ["Fry played a handful of matches for Hampshire in the 1960 season in one of which he was twice bowled (for 14 and 1) in a match (versus Sussex) by one of his successors as President of the MCC Robin Marlar.

When the paperback of Oborne's book on the D'Oliveira affair, Basil D'Oliveira, Cricket and Conspiracy: The Untold Story was published in 2005, Owen Slot wrote in a review in The Times, that Oborne \"sets it up beautifully: one gentle, conservative Cape Town coloured man versus apartheid at its most rabid, the odds stacked heavily against the former\".  Robin Marlar in The Sunday Times thought \"the positives in this book have it by a mile, the good guys are praised, and the others revealed\". The book was written with D'Oliveira's involvement  and won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year in 2004."]}, {"page": "Holly Colvin", "response": ["Born in Chichester, Colvin attended the nearby Westbourne House School. A right-hand bat and slow left arm bowler, she originally played as a batsman and started playing for the 1st XI in year 7 and soon averaged over 100. After Westbourne House, Colvin followed in the footsteps of England women's captain Clare Connor by playing in the boys' team at Brighton College. Competing in the Lord's Taverners under-15 Cup in 2004, Colvin and fellow Brightonian Sarah Taylor were the only girls amongst the 1,000 participating teams. Colvin and Taylor's involvement in the competition caused controversy within the MCC, with president Robin Marlar calling their inclusion \"absolutely outrageous\". He proceeded to argue that, \"if there's an 18-year-old who can bowl at 80mph and he's been brought up properly then he shouldn't want to hurt a lady at any cost\". Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, dismissed the comments as \"show[ing] a huge generation gap\"; Colvin herself commented that \"we just thought it was funny... [they] don't treat me any different. They bowl at me just as fast and hit the ball just as hard\". On a cricket tour to Sri Lanka in December 2004, she was one of the last people to play at the Galle International Stadium before it was flattened by the tsunami of Boxing Day that year. In December 2006, Colvin was named as 'Female Pupil of the Year' by The Telegraph's 'School Sport Matters' campaign, receiving the award at Lord's from Olympic gold-medallist Kelly Holmes."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Robin Marlar (1931\u2013), English first-class cricketerMARLAR, Robin Geoffrey, Who's Who 2017, A & C Black, 2017 (online edition, Oxford University Press, 2016)"]}, {"page": "Roland Perry", "response": ["Captain Australia covered every Australian skipper (except for Ricky Ponting) since Test cricket began.
