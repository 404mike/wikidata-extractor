He finished tied for 24th place in the 1995 Open Championship at St Andrews, winning the silver medal as low amateur ahead of Tiger Woods. He turned professional later that year.\nWebster was medalist at the 1995 European Tour Qualifying School. He finished in 129th place on the Order of Merit in his rookie season, just missing out on retaining his playing privileges and forcing him to return to qualifying school, where he was again successful. Since 1997 he has made the top 100 on the Order of Merit every season, to comfortably retain his place on Europe's elite tour.\nIn 2005 Webster won his first European Tour title at the Telecom Italia Open, and finished a career best 29th on the Order of Merit. In 2007 he won his second European Tour event at the Portugal Masters.Webster was a member of the winning Great Britain & Ireland team at the 2002 Seve Trophy and again in 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Open Championship", "response": ["* 1995 \u2013  Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Atherstone", "response": ["* Steve Webster (born 1975) an English professional golfer."]}, {"page": "Retief Goosen", "response": ["| Steve Webster", "| Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "South African Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2004 || AFR, EUR ||  Trevor Immelman (2) || align=\"center\" |276 || align=center|\u221212 || 3 strokes ||  Alastair Forsyth Steve Webster|| Erinvale || ", "| 2002 || AFR, EUR ||  Tim Clark || align=\"center\" |269 || align=center|\u221219 || 2 strokes ||  Steve Webster|| The Country Club || "]}, {"page": "Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez", "response": ["| Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Thongchai Jaidee", "response": ["| Simon Dyson,  Alex Nor\u00e9n, Steve Webster", "| Simon Dyson,  Alex Nor\u00e9n, Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "European Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2009 ||  Christian C\u00e9va\u00ebr || align=center|281 || align=center|\u22127 || 1 stroke ||  Gary Orr \u00c1lvaro Quir\u00f3s Steve Webster || London"]}, {"page": "Tim Clark (golfer)", "response": ["| Steve Webster", "| Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Trevor Immelman", "response": ["| Alastair Forsyth,  Steve Webster", "| Alastair Forsyth,  Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Indonesia Open (golf)", "response": ["|ASA, EUR||  Thongchai Jaidee || align=\"center\" |276 || align=center|\u221212 || 2 strokes ||  Simon Dyson Alex Nor\u00e9n Steve Webster || "]}, {"page": "Christian C\u00e9va\u00ebr", "response": ["| Gary Orr,  \u00c1lvaro Quir\u00f3s, Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Italian Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2013 || Julien Quesne|| align=\"center\" |276 || align=\"center\" |\u221212 || 1 stroke || David Higgins Steve Webster|| Torino || ", "| 2005 || Steve Webster|| align=\"center\" |270 || align=\"center\" |\u221218 || 3 strokes || Bradley Dredge Richard Finch Anders Hansen|| Castello Tolcinasco || "]}, {"page": "German Open (golf)", "response": ["| 1998 ||  Stephen Allan || align=center|280 || align=center|\u22128 || 1 stroke ||  Ignacio Garrido P\u00e1draig Harrington Mark Roe Steve Webster || Sporting Club Berlin || "]}, {"page": "Madrid Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2001 ||  Retief Goosen || align=center|264 || align=center|\u221220 || Playoff ||  Steve Webster || align=center|1,404,197 || align=center|233,330 "]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["*1994 Steven Craig, Carl Duke, Alastair Forsyth, Gary Harris, Jamie Harris, Craig Heap, Jamie Little, Ciaran McMonagle, Stephen Raybould, Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Stephen Allan", "response": ["| Ignacio Garrido,  P\u00e1draig Harrington, Mark Roe,  Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Czech Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2009 || EUR ||  Oskar Henningsson || align=center|275 || align=center|\u221213 || 2 strokes ||  Sam Little Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Turespa\u00f1a Masters", "response": ["| 1999 ||  Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez (2) || align=center|264 || align=center|\u221224 || 4 strokes ||  Steve Webster"]}, {"page": "Portugal Masters", "response": ["| 2007 ||  Steve Webster || align=center|263 || align=center|\u221225 || 2 strokes ||  Robert Karlsson"]}, {"page": "2007 European Tour", "response": ["| Steve Webster (2)"]}, {"page": "Gordon Sherry", "response": ["His win in the Amateur Championship gave Sherry the opportunity to play in both the Open Championship and the Masters Tournament, two of golf major championships.
