In a decade at Turf Moor, he made 117 league appearances. After a 1966\u201367 Fairs Cup third-round tie against Napoli, an Italian newspaper called him \"a god in a green jersey\", after Thomson kept a clean sheet over two legs in Burnley's 3\u20130 aggregate victory.Thomson made two appearances for the Scotland national team during a 1967 overseas tour that the Scottish Football Association decided in October 2021 to reclassify as full internationals.In 1969, he joined Burnley's Lancashire rivals Blackpool for \u00a35,000. He made his debut in the first game of the 1969\u201370 season, on 9 August 1969, in a 2\u20131 victory over Portsmouth at Bloomfield Road.

His final game for the club occurred on 13 February 1971, in a 2\u20130 defeat at Coventry City.\nThomson finished his thirteen-year career at Barrow in 1972.\nHe died of throat cancer on 14 March 2013, and was survived by his wife, two children and four grandchildren.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2013 in association football", "response": ["* March 14 \u2013 Harry Thomson, Scottish footballer (72)"]}, {"page": "History of Blackpool F.C.

The first leg at Turf Moor ended in a 3\u20130 victory with goals from Coates, Les Latcham and Lochhead, who scored his sixth goal in the competition. Napoli ended the match with 10 men after defender  was sent off for kicking Lochhead in the head. The return leg three weeks later proved to be much more difficult for Burnley. The Italian press previewed the match in a belligerent manner: \"From Lancashire where studs are made out of rose petals ... to Naples where visiting players are put through a mincing machine at the end of the game and their remains are roasted on a spit\". A crowd of 60,000 saw Burnley goalkeeper Harry Thomson making 13 saves, including a penalty kick from Jos\u00e9 Altafini, as the match ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The game was again not without controversy: Dave Merrington was elbowed in the stomach by a frustrated Omar Sivori in the closing stages of the match and after the match ended, Thomson was spat in his face by Alberto Orlando, who also refused his handshake. The team, the Burnley fans and the English press were escorted to the airport by a convoy to escape the Napoli fans, who hurled missiles during the match. After the game, Thomson was hailed by the Italian press as a \"God in a Green Jersey\"."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 in Scottish football", "response": ["* 14 March: Harry Thomson, 72, Burnley and Blackpool goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Harry Thomson, 72, footballer (Burnley F.C.)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2013", "response": ["*Harry Thomson, 72, Scottish footballer (Burnley F.C.), throat cancer.Clarets' hero of Naples dies|Burnley Express"]}, {"page": "Harry Thomson", "response": ["Harry Thomson may refer to:", "* Harry Thomson (footballer) (1940\u20132013), Scottish footballer", "* Harry Thomson (politician) (1934\u20132019), Malawian businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (unofficial matches)", "response": ["*Harry Thomson (Burnley)"]}]}}
