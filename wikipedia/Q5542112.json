Wisden described Hutton's tour as a succession of triumphs until he tired at the end: \"Hutton's driving aroused the greatest admiration, but all his strokes were stamped with the hallmark of class.\" Before the Test matches began, Hutton scored three centuries and then contributed 83 as England won the first Test.Howat, p. 80. The next three Tests were drawn. In the second match, Hutton and Washbrook set a new Test match record opening partnership. In easy batting conditions, they shared 359 runs on the first day before Hutton was out for 158 after almost five hours batting. In more favourable bowling conditions in the third Test, Hutton scored 41 and 87, followed by 123 in the fourth game which settled England's second innings at a dangerous time. England won the final game to take the series 2\u20130, and Hutton finished the Test series with 577 runs at an average of 64.11, while in all first-class matches he recorded 1,477 runs at an average of 73.85."]}, {"page": "John Arlott", "response": ["One comment often noted was made in 1975, to describe a shot by Clive Lloyd as \"the stroke of a man knocking a thistle top off with a walking stick.\" On England's 1948\u20139 tour to South Africa, the England captain George Mann was bowled by his namesake Tufty Mann.
