The first objects of his attentions were the members of the Royal Academy. These attempts being well received, he soon began to fly at higher game, the King and Queen being the most frequent marks for his satirical shafts. In 1786 he published The Lousiad, a Heroi-Comic Poem, which took its name from a legend that a louse had once appeared on the King's dinner plate. In London Wolcot became an important figure in the art world as patron of both John Opie and later, Richard Morton Paye.  "]}]}}
