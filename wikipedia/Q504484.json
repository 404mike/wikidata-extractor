He was born to a Roman Catholic father and Jewish mother (who later converted to Roman Catholicism).  \nFrom 1962 to 1979, he was a member of the School of European Studies at University of Sussex, before moving to the University of Cambridge, where he holds the title of Professor Emeritus of Cultural History and Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Burke is celebrated as a historian not only of the early modern era, but one who emphasizes the relevance of social and cultural history to modern issues. He is married to the Brazilian historian Maria L\u00facia Garcia Pallares-Burke who is the author of two books (in one of which she collaborated with her husband).\nHe was educated by the Jesuits and at St John's College, Oxford and was a doctoral candidate at St Antony's College, Oxford.From 1962 to 1979 he was part of the School of European Studies at the University of Sussex, and then went on to the University of Cambridge, where he is now Professor Emeritus of Cultural History, and a Fellow of Emmanuel College.\nBurke is not only known for his work on the Modern Age but also for his research on cultural history across its entire spectrum. As a  polyglot, he has managed on the one hand to incorporate information from a good part of Europe and has also achieved good diffusion of his books. They have been translated into more than thirty languages. In 1998, he was awarded the Erasmus Medal of the European Academy, and is an honorary doctorate from the Universities of Lund, Copenhagen and Bucharest.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Annales school", "response": ["*  Bloch, Marc.

The cultural historian Peter Burke suggested that \"it may be worth investigating the social organization of forgetting, the rules of exclusion, suppression or repression, and the question of who wants whom to forget what\". In an in-depth historical study spanning two centuries, Guy Beiner proposed the term \"social forgetting\", which he distinguished from crude notions of \"collective amnesia\" and \"total oblivion\", arguing that \"social forgetting is to be found in the interface of public silence and more private remembrance\"."]}, {"page": "Historiography", "response": ["The British historian Peter Burke finds that cultural studies has numerous spinoffs, or topical themes it has strongly influenced.

He conceived \"the people\" as comprising all the classes of society, rich, middle, and poor, and not only those engaged in manual labor as Marxists sometimes use the word.In his 1978 book Popular Culture in Early Modern Europe (New York: Harper and Row, 1978), Peter Burke argues that before 1800 all classes of society did participate in popular culture in just this way. Although Child concentrated his collections on manuscript texts with a view to determining their chronology, he also gave a sedulous but conservative hearing to popular versions still surviving.The next generation of scholars engaged directly in field research from oral sources, and some, like music educator Cecil Sharp, who was primarily interested in finding the tunes for the Child ballads, also collected music and dances. Child carried his investigations into the ballads of languages other than English, engaging in extensive international correspondence on the subject with colleagues abroad, primarily with the Danish literary historian and ethnographer Svend Grundtvig, whose monumental twelve-volume compilation of Danish ballads, Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, vols. 1\u201312 (Copenhagen, 1853), was the model for Child's resulting canonical five-volume edition of some 305 English and Scottish ballads and their numerous variants.For more about Grundtvig and Child, see Sigurd Bernhard Hustvedt, Ballad Books and Ballad Men (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1930), pp. 175-204 and 205-229, as well as their correspondence, pp. 247\u2013300. Since the ballads were known to have been a pan-European, Turkish, and North African phenomenon, Child and Grundtvig also consulted with numerous scholars in other parts of the world, such as, for example, the Sicilian physician, folklorist, and ethnographer Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8.Pitr\u00e8, who was the founder of the Italian Folklore Society and became an honorary member of the American Folklore Society in 1890.
