Several non-profit organizations solicit donated pianos from the community and give Santa Barbara-based artists an opportunity to paint and decorate the pianos.  The pianos are installed in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara where they are on display from one to three weeks.  Many youth and social service organizations participate as artists or as scheduled performers throughout the duration of the program.  The program has become a well-loved project by the community attracting local residents and tourists of all ages, artistic styles and socio-economic backgrounds.  A permanent display of a painted piano also sits at the Santa Barbara Airport.", "Inspired by Luke Jerram\u2019s Play Me, I'm Yours, Pianos About Town started in 2010 as a collaboration between Bohemian Foundation, the Downtown Development Authority, and the City of Fort Collins Art in Public Places Program.

The painted pianos are then rotated between 20 locations around Fort Collins for the public to play. The program has painted 145 pianos as of 2021. The project has become a model for similar projects across the country."]}, {"page": "Stratford Summer Music Festival", "response": ["In 2018 the Museum of the Moon, an exhibit created by UK artist Luke Jerram, was installed.
