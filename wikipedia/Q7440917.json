The show is considered by many to be one of BBC NI's most successful programmes due to its longevity and popularity.\nHe graduated from Queen's University Belfast in 1980 with a BA in French and Classical Greek. He taught French language for seventeen years at school. He worked the after-dinner comic entertainment circuit for many years, and he felt that his language background contributed to his voice-over impressions. During the Troubles, comedians needed to adopt a non-partisan stance, so his stage name was a neutral-sounding non-Catholic pseudonym.Se\u00e1n Crummey was well known for his hilariously accurate depictions and his gentle, humorous political satire. He impersonated dozens of voices, particularly of Northern Ireland politicians. Some of Crummey's favourite voices to impersonate were the late PUP leader David Ervine, Pope John Paul II, and Bill McLaren.He also wrote and starred in Stormont, a stage play produced by Martin Lynch and directed by Michael Poynor, that ran at the Theatre at the Mill in Newtownabbey mid-September to early October 2010 selling out many nights of the show's run. On stage, Crummey alternately mimicked two politicians, Ulster Unionist Michael McGimpsey and Sinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Kelly.He died from a cancer-related illness just a day after his final show was broadcast. Politicians from across the political spectrum gave respectful tribute to his comic genius, penetrating humour, and talented political commentary. His funeral was attended by thousands and an unusually large number of famous individuals from all walks of life.A tribute show was broadcast on New Year's Day, 2012. A memorial fund set up in memory of Se\u00e1n Crummey donated \u00a360,000 to Queen's Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Folks on the Hill", "response": ["The Folks on the Hill was a satirical sketch show, which started in January 2001 as a Saturday morning BBC Radio Ulster broadcast.
