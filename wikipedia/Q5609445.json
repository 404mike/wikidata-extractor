He wrote: \"As a result of reduced maintenance checks, 'some long-haul sets [trains] are in use with brake defects'. Increasing cuts in staff combined with an increasing pressure to ensure that trains run safely has resulted in fears among staff that a major accident is 'just around the corner'.\" Passengers, he added, \"have been 'poisoned' as a result of coffee machines not being cleaned correctly, with cleaning fluids left in situ\".
