The legend associated with Campbell is that a number of years prior\u2014while still living in Scotland\u2014Campbell gave shelter to a stranger who turned out to have killed Duncan's cousin.  Faced with the conflict between betraying a guest or taking vengeance for the death of his cousin, Campbell compromised by allowing the killer to hide out in a cave.  The ghost of Campbell's cousin is claimed to have appeared to Campbell in a dream and promised to meet him again at Ticonderoga, a place that Duncan surely had never heard of previously. This story was published in the poem \"Ticonderoga a Legend of the West Highlands\" by Robert Louis Stevenson in Scribner's Magazine December 1887.Campbell's 42nd Regiment of Foot Highlanders took many casualties in the ill-fated attack on Fort Carillon.  Legend has it that the battle was replicated in the clouds over Inveraray Castle in Scotland on the afternoon of the attack.  The story of the ghostly prediction and the apparition in the clouds over Inverawe has been repeated a number of times in magazines, song, and used several times in television scripts.\nHis remains are interred at the Union Cemetery in Fort Edward, NY alongside Jane McCrea and her cousin Sara McNeil.", "link_mentions": {}}}
