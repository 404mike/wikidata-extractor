Sir John Spielman set up the first paper mill in England at Dartford in 1588 on a site near Powder Mill Lane, and soon some 600 employees worked there, providing an invaluable source of local employment. Iron-making on the Weald was in full operation at this time, and iron ingots were sent to Dartford, to England's first iron-slitting mill, set up by the Darent at Dartford Creek in 1595 by Godfrey Box, an immigrant from the Low Countries.  In 1785, John Hall, a millwright set up a workshop in Lowfield Street and began to make engines, boilers and machinery (some of it for the local gunpowder factory run by Miles Peter Andrews and the Pigou family), marking the foundation of J & E Hall, an engineering firm specialising in heavy engineering, and later refrigerating equipment, and, for 20 years from 1906, vehicle production, plus lifts and escalators."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Farren", "response": ["In September 1778 she made her first appearance at Drury Lane, as Charlotte Rusport in the West Indian.

It is still remembered through a jest of Sheridan, who burst into the greenroom, when the success of the play was established, with the shout of inquiry, \"Where is he, my guardian angel?\" The answer was made, \"The author has just retired,\" but Sheridan replied, \"Pooh! I mean the dog-actor, author and preserver of Drury Lane Theatre.\" Lord Byron took a swipe at Reynolds in \"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,\" where he says: \"Where Reynolds vents his 'dammes!'
