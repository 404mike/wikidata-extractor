She was the first woman to study Archaeology & Anthropology at the University of Cambridge. A specialist in prehistoric archaeology she excavated Neanderthal remains at the Palaeolithic site of Mount Carmel with Yusra and Dorothy Garrod. She was a representative for the UK at UNESCO, and was curator of the 'People of Britain' pavilion at the Festival of Britain.  \nWidely recognised for her book A Land (1951), she wrote widely on archaeology, fusing a literary style of writing with a deep knowledge of landscape and past human lives, as well as using film and radio to enable archaeology to reach new audiences. In 1953 she married J B Priestley, with whom she authored several works. She was co-founder of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and an active campaigner in the Homosexual Law Reform Society. In 1967 she published Dawn of the Gods, a 'feminine' interpretation of the Minoan civilisation. In 1971 the Council for British Archaeology rewarded her advocacy for the discipline with the role of Vice-President.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of anthropologists", "response": ["*Jacquetta Hawkes"]}, {"page": "Jersey", "response": ["*The Archaeology of the Channel Islands.

On the basis of this report, Wheeler was able to secure a dramatic rise in funding from the British Treasury; they increased their annual grant to \u00a325,000, and promised that this would increase to \u00a350,000 shortly after. According to his later biographer Jacquetta Hawkes, in doing so Wheeler raised the position of the Academy to that of \"the main source of official patronage for the humanities\" within the United Kingdom, while Piggott stated that he set the organisation upon its \"modern course\".", "Mallowan noted that \"Immediate and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship, although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod.\" Jacquetta Hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of the archaeological evidence because he was \"sometimes too sure of being right, too ready to accept his own authority\". She asserted that while Wheeler was not an original thinker, he had \"a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces, however small, in its widest significance.\"", "In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \"this very readable little book\" as being \"adulatory\" in tone, \"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \"a very great liking\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \"a daemonic energy\", with his accomplishments in India being \"almost superhuman\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness."]}, {"page": "Festival of Britain", "response": ["*The People of Britain.

For example, in one of his publications, Crawford dismissed historians as being \"bookish\" and \"clean-booted\".

This was followed in 1950 by Herdsman and Hermits: Celtic Seafarers in the Northern Sea, in which he returned to his interest in seafaring and boats. Containing a foreword by Kendrick, it was published by Bowes and Bowes. In 1952, Lethbridge published Coast Wise Craft, which again looked at boat building but was aimed at a general rather than specialist readership. That same year, Thames and Hudson published Lethbridge's Boats and Boatmen as part of their \"The Past in the Present\" series edited by archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes. In 1954, Andrew Melrose published Lethbridge's The Painted Men, a book about the Picts of Northern Britain. It was deemed to be his last conventional book within the archaeological and academic community. As part of his increasing public profile, the BBC invited him to give the third talk in their second series of Myth or Legend?, which he devoted to the question of whether Europeans had arrived in the Americas prior to Christopher Columbus; in particular he looked at the claims that St. Brendan and Thorfinn Karlsefni had made the journey across the Atlantic.
