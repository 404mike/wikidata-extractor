Later he reworked some of these drawings into paintings such as one  showing Siddons in the sleepwalking scene from Macbeth, shown at the British Institution in 1815, and another showing the letter scene from the same play.A Passion for Performance: Sarah Siddons and her Portraitists pp.11, 86 A commission from the music teacher Thomas WelshA Passion for Performance: Sarah Siddons and her Portraitists p.87 to paint Siddons as Queen Katharine in Shakespeare's Henry VIII. This was begun from memory, but subsequently the actress, at Welsh's request, gave the painter a sitting. While painting the portrait, Harlow decided to expand the picture into the \"Trial Scene\" from the same play, introducing portraits of the various members of the Kemble family and others. Welsh, though not consulted by Harlow concerning this change of plan, behaved generously. The picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, and excited great public interest. It was neither well composed nor well executed, and owed much to the criticism and suggestions of Fuseli, whose portrait Harlow was painting at the time. Still, the portrait of Mrs. Siddons herself as the queen will remain one of the most striking figures in English art. Harlow's next picture, The Virtue of Faith, at the Royal Academy, lacked originality, and had less success. It was purchased by his friend Mr. Tomkisson, who cut it into pieces for the sake of the heads."]}, {"page": "Green-Eyed Monster (disambiguation)", "response": ["* The Green-eyed Monster (or How to Get Your Money), operatic farce by Thomas Welsh (1811)"]}, {"page": "Isaac Pocock", "response": ["Twenty Years Ago, a melodramatic entertainment, was performed at the Lyceum Theatre in 1810. Anything New, with overture and music by Charles Smith, was given on 1 July 1811, but the Green-eyed Monster, produced on 14 October with William Dowton, William Oxberry, and Miss Mellon in the cast, was harshly reviewed. Nevertheless, it was revived at Drury Lane in 1828, when William Farren and Ellen Tree played in it. The music was composed by Thomas Welsh.

In 1807, having shown, like her elder sisters, some musical ability, she was placed under Gesualdo Lanza, with whom she remained five years. Under his care she sang in Bath, Bristol, Southampton, Ramsgate, Margate and other places, appearing early in 1812 in subordinate parts at the Pantheon as member of an Italian opera company, headed by Teresa Bertinotti. At the close, in 1812, of her engagement with Lanza, her father placed her under Thomas Welsh, as whose pupil she sang anonymously on 17 and 19 November in Manchester."]}, {"page": "John Templeton (tenor)", "response": ["He was born at Riccarton, near Kilmarnock, the son of Robert Templeton. He was the youngest of three brothers, all of whom had musical talent. His elder brother James was a distinguished music teacher in Edinburgh, and his other brother Robert was a precentor, in the Laigh Kirk, Kilmarnock. John had a fine voice as a boy and from the age of 14 until his voice broke when he was 17, took part in concerts in Edinburgh with his brother James. In 1822 he became precentor to the Rose Street Secession church. Then, intending to become a professional singer, he went to London and studied under Jonathan Blewitt, Thomas Welsh, De Pinna, and Tom Cooke."]}, {"page": "Sarah West (actress)", "response": ["West's father was connected with Drury Lane Theatre. After studying music under Thomas Welsh and subsequently under Charles Edward Horn, he appeared at the Haymarket Theatre in 1805 as Tom Thumb. He then played parts at Drury Lane such as Juba in The Prize and Boy in Children in the Wood. In 1814 he followed Sarah to Edinburgh, and next year married her, in the teeth of much competition."]}, {"page": "Argyll Rooms", "response": ["In 1818, Slade was forced to sell by the Regent Street commissioners. Slade was awarded by a jury \u00a323,000 as compensation (a sum considered high at the time), and the whole of the old building was removed and new rooms erected, on the east side of Regent Street at the north-west corner of Argyll Place. The new building was designed by Nash: on the side next Regent Street was a balcony supported by eight caryatids. The group by whom it was erected were 21 of the prominent London musicians in London, who had formed the Royal Harmonic Institution to publish music. This organisation occupied, for the purposes of its trade, the southwestern angle of the new building (at the corner of Regent Street and Argyll Place), circular with a domed roof. The cost of the building, with other factors, soon led to the withdrawal of most of the original investors, at a loss of about \u00a31800 each, and the place eventually fell into the hands of two of them, Thomas Welsh and William Hawes. They then fell out, and ultimately Hawes, by an act of bankruptcy, forced a dissolution of the partnership, and the concern then remained in the hands of Welsh alone."]}, {"page": "Charles Frederick Baumgarten", "response": ["His many pupils included William Dance, Thomas Welsh and William Thomas Parke."]}, {"page": "Madame Sala", "response": ["McGarel found lodging for Henrietta in the home of the widow Susanna Sala, who lived in Marylebone. At Kensington House Academy, Simon studied English etiquette, French, and music. When she turned eighteen in 1807, she received a communication from her father that no further funds would be forthcoming and that she must earn her own living. She left Kensington and began studying at the school run by Susanna Sala since the death of her husband in 1800. Simon also studied voice with Timothy Essex and Thomas Welsh. She had little contact with her family until 1810, when her grandmother, Dorothy Thomas, arrived with her two youngest children; over a dozen of her Coxall, Garraway, Robertson, and Fullerton cousins; and some of her own siblings from Demerara to enroll them in school. The girls attended Kensington House Academy and the boys were enrolled at Glasgow's Dollar Academy. Simon very probably secured a dowry from her grandmother to facilitate her marriage to Susanna's son Augustus John James Sala on 22 June 1812."]}]}}
