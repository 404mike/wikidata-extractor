She was forced to drop out of that production a few days before the opening, due to \"chronic, debilitating insomnia\". She returned to New York and started a program of cognitive behaviour therapy to train herself to be able to sleep better. The therapy was successful; it included developing certain evening rituals, removing electronic devices from her bedroom, and limiting the use of the bed to two activities, one of which would be sleeping. Meanwhile, for the scheduled December 2015 opening of Skinner's play, actress Noma Dumezweni took over the role to much acclaim and publicity.Taylor, Paul. \"Linda, Royal Court, London, review: Takedown of the beauty industry is only skin deep.\" Independent. 6 December 2015.Mulkerrins, Jane. \"Kim Cattrall on insomnia: 'What I felt in spades was how alone I was'\".
