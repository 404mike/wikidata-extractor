Michael Harrington joined Zusi as the most recently injured when he also went down in training with a hamstring strain. The patchwork defense returned home for the first Sunday match of the season featuring rookie and 1st round pick Matt Besler in the back line against a then potent attacking SJ Earthquakes team. For the second week in a row the club faced difficult weather conditions (freezing rain and wind gusts up to 40 MPH). They responded with a better effort, shutting out the Quakes and securing their first win of the season 2-0. Week 4 brought a trip to Seattle to face the undefeated expansion Sounders. The Wizards controlled the first half despite not scoring and saw the Sounders go down a man in the 29th minute when goalkeeper Kasey Keller used his hands outside of the box to deflect a scoring chance from the fast breaking Herculez Gomez. The Wizards couldn't capitalize in the first half and the Sounders looked the better side in the second half until Davy Arnaud launched a game-winning missile from 30 yards out in the 80th minute to deliver the first goal surrendered and first loss to Seattle. The road trip continued onto the Eastern Conference leading Chicago Fire.  The Fire sharply outplayed the relatively sluggish Wizards for the entire first half and most of the second half, with Brian McBride scoring two early goals.  However goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made several spectacular saves to prevent Chicago from any further scoring, and the Wizards were able to muster a comeback late in the second half, with Josh Wolff scoring two goals of his own to equalize the match 2-2. The Wizards welcomed New York to town for the first ever ESPN telecast from Community America Ballpark, Red Bull defender Carlos Johnson took Herculez Gomez down in the box just two minutes into the match and received a red card for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. Neither team played particularly well following the ejection of Johnson but Kansas City got the three points as a result of Claudio L\u00f3pez slotting the resulting penalty kick past newly reinstated Jon Conway, who had served the longest performance-enhancing drug suspension ever in Major League Soccer. Jack Jewsbury didn't make the final road trip of April to Toronto as a result of the concussion he suffered just days earlier. The Wizards missed their holding midfielder as TFC played their first match under interim manager Chris Cummins as John Carver stepped down. Toronto was also missing star player Dwayne De Rosario (injured) but Danny Dichio's scramble goal in the 54th minute and TFC's clean sheet was enough to end the Wizards 18 regular season game streak of scoring at least one goal (second longest in the team history).
