He joined the army in 1782 but after his first two regiments were quickly disbanded he joined the 36th Regiment of Foot stationed in India in 1784. Here he saw his first action, fighting tax collectors as a deputy quartermaster general. He returned to England in 1787 suffering from an illness, and became aide de camp to General Thomas Bruce in Ireland. After being promoted to captain lieutenant Walker studied German and tactics in Germany until he was promoted to captain in the 60th Regiment of Foot in 1791. When the French Revolutionary War began in 1793 he took a force of volunteers to reinforce the Flanders Campaign, where he fought at the Battle of Tournay. He was appointed Inspector of Foreign Corps while serving on the continent, and as such helped form Roll's Regiment for British service. He took them to England in 1796, and having been promoted to major he went to serve in Portugal in 1797. Here Walker again served as an aide de camp, to at first Major-General Simon Fraser and then the Prince of Waldeck.\nWalker was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1799 and given command of the 50th Regiment of Foot. After serving as an advisor in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland he commanded the regiment in garrisons at Malta and Ireland until 1807 when the regiment fought at the Battle of Copenhagen. After this he was sent with his regiment to join Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley's army in Portugal in 1808. Being in the reserve at the Battle of Roli\u00e7a, he saw action in the Peninsular War for the first time at the Battle of Vimeiro where his regiment was highly successful. Later in the year Walker was promoted to colonel, and after a period of leave and independent service he re-joined the 50th in time to fight in the Walcheren Campaign of 1809. In 1810 Walker was made a brigadier-general and sent to serve as a liaison with the Spanish patriot armies of Galicia and Asturias.\nWalker was successful in his role and was promoted to major-general in 1811, but the infighting and logistical difficulties of the Spaniards led him to successfully apply for a regular command in the British peninsular army. He was given the 2nd Brigade of the 5th Division in which he fought at the Siege of Badajoz in 1812. His brigade formed the spearhead of a diversionary attack against the fortress, in which Walker was badly injured after rallying his men from a rout caused by rumours about a mine. Walker took the rest of the year to recover from his injuries and re-joined the peninsular in 1812 as commander of the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Division. As such he fought at the Battle of Nivelle later in the year, and then was appointed temporary commander of the 7th Division while its commander was on leave. He commanded the division into 1814, fighting at the Battle of the Nive and the Battle of Orthez where he was again injured. After this he returned to his brigade command, only to learn that his wife had died in February. With his wounds worsening, he took the opportunity to resign his command and did not serve again in the war.\nWalker later served as Governor of Grenada between 1815 and 1817, and then as Commander-in-Chief, Madras Army, between 1826 and 1831. His last official position was as Lieutenant-Governor, Royal Hospital Chelsea, from 1837. He died in 1842, having through his services earned a baronetcy, and been appointed a knight of the Order of the Bath and of the Order of the Tower and Sword.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Walker", "response": ["*Sir George Walker, 1st Baronet (1764\u20131842), British General, of the Forestier-Walker baronets"]}, {"page": "Forestier-Walker baronets", "response": ["*Sir George Walker, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot", "response": ["*1822\u20131839: Gen Sir George Walker, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "General Walker", "response": ["*Sir George Walker, 1st Baronet (1764\u20131842), British Army general"]}]}}
