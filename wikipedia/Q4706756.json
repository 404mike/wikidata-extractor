Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove as director of the college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy but affectionate. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do.Kennedy (1980), p. 19 Beneath Stanford's severity lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.Dibble, p. 268; and Kennedy (1980), p. 19"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Alan Gray (Trinity)"]}, {"page": "Descant", "response": ["Among composers of descants during 1915 to 1934 were Alan Gray, Geoffrey Shaw, and Ralph Vaughan Williams.

In this period at Cambridge, he studied composition with Charles Wood, organ with Alan Gray, and piano with Ursula Newton (a former pupil of Ferruccio Busoni).  Many of his compositions at time were premiered by the college choir or orchestra. He also became known as a promising conductor.

John Bawden assumes that he wrote the works even earlier, in 1892, when he left his position as the organist of Trinity College, Cambridge, dedicating them to Alan Gray, his successor, and the college choir. Stanford's biographer Jeremy Dibble noted performances of the first motet at the chapel of Trinity College during Evensong on 24 February 1888 and 24 February 1892, and of the last one likely there on 1 February 1890, and therefore deduced that they were written around 1887/88. In a letter dated 18 November 1888, Stanford wrote to the publisher Novello of his interest in setting introits from the Catholic missal, which he felt were \"admirably suitable and always lyrical (not didactic) in character\". In 1891, he wrote to the publisher requesting the return of the scores that were not published, because he wanted to reuse them.
