He came through the youth ranks with Chester and made his first-team debut in 1994\u201395. He remained with the club until the eve of the 1999\u20132000 season, when he moved up to Division Two by joining Blackpool, where he enjoyed a long and successful seven-year stint that included three victories at the Millennium Stadium. Two of these were winning Football League Trophy finals; he started and scored in both finals in 2002 and 2004.Murphy rejoined Chester from Cheshire neighbours Macclesfield Town, whom he joined from Blackpool in January 2007 after making a loan move permanent. On 6 January 2007, during his loan spell, Murphy scored Macclesfield's goal in their 6\u20131 FA Cup Third Round defeat against Chelsea at  Stamford Bridge to briefly bring the tie level.He rejoined Chester on 29 June 2007. His first league game back at the club saw Murphy feature in the starting line-up in the goalless draw with Chesterfield on 11 August 2007, with his first two goals back at the club coming in a 4\u20130 demolition of Dagenham & Redbridge a fortnight later. Almost inevitably, he scored on his return to Macclesfield in a 2\u20131 win for Chester on 29 September 2007.\nMurphy signed for St Patrick's Athletic on 31 July 2008 for an undisclosed fee. After an injury-plagued spell at the club, which restricted him to one substitute league appearance, he was released on 4 February 2009.In August 2011, Murphy was offered a role as a coach at Blackpool - which he accepted.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Murphy", "response": ["John Murphy may refer to:", "*John Murphy (fiddle player) (1875\u20131955), Irish fiddle player", "*John Murphy (playwright) (1929\u20131998), Irish dramatist, author of The Country Boy", "*John Murphy (musician) (1959\u20132015), Australian drummer and multi-instrument musician", "*Kim Deal (a.k.a.
