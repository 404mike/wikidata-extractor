He had loan spells with Brentford, TPS and Bristol Rovers before joining the side permanently on a 2-year contract in May 2010. In December 2012 he signed a two-year contract with his former club TPS in the Finnish Veikkausliiga. A few months into his second season Brown joined Veikkausliiga side SJK. In May 2016, Brown signed with A-League club, the Newcastle Jets on a 2-year marquee contract.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dominic Blizzard", "response": ["During the 2010\u201311 season, Blizzard lost his starting place in the \"Pirates\" first eleven, as new signing Wayne Brown came in and took his place. He gained his first start of the season in September, after Brown was ruled out with an ankle problem. Two months later manager Paul Trollope announced his intention to try to find a club for Blizzard to join on loan. In March 2011, he joined Port Vale on loan until the end of the season; this reunited him with Jim Gannon, his former boss at Stockport. His spell would last a matter of days however. Arriving on the 18th, he played in the 3\u20130 defeat to Accrington Stanley on the 19th, and returned to Rovers on the 21st after Gannon was sacked. He departed parent club Rovers by mutual consent in June 2011."]}, {"page": "Wayne Brown", "response": ["Wayne Brown may refer to:", "* Wayne Brown (ice hockey) (born 1930), Canadian ice hockey player", "* Wayne Brown (politician) (1936\u20132013), American politician and accountant", "* Wayne Brown (author) (1944\u20132009), writer born in Trinidad and Tobago", "* Wayne Brown (footballer, born January 1977), English football goalkeeper", "* Wayne Brown (footballer, born August 1977), English football defender", "* Wayne Brown (footballer, born 1988), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|30||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Wayne Brown *"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Wayne Brown *", "| Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "2009 Veikkausliiga", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Wayne Brown", "|align=\"left\"| Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "List of foreign A-League Men players", "response": ["* Wayne Brown \u2013 Newcastle Jets \u2013 2016\u201318"]}, {"page": "Wayne Brown (midfielder)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wayne Brown (footballer, born 1988)"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 A-League", "response": ["|  Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Veikkausliiga players", "response": ["* Wayne Brown \u2013 TPS, SJK \u2013 2009, 2013\u201315"]}, {"page": "Wayne Brown (footballer born 1988)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wayne Brown (footballer, born 1988)"]}, {"page": "2015 SJK season", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|6 ||MF||||10||Wayne Brown||2||1||0||0||3", "|10||||MF||Wayne Brown||3||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||4||0"]}, {"page": "2014 SJK season", "response": ["|10||||MF||Wayne Brown||2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Wayne Brown", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Wayne Brown", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Wayne Brown", "| Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Newcastle Jets FC season", "response": ["|  Wayne Brown|| Midfielder || 1 year || 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 A-League", "response": ["|  Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "List of foreign A-League Men goalscorers", "response": ["* Wayne Brown \u2014 Newcastle Jets (2)"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|Wayne Brown"]}]}}
