Newcastle advanced to the final of the FA Cup, and Given played the whole match as the team were defeated 2\u20130 by league champions Arsenal.

I think we have two keepers \u2014 and Harper is proving that \u2014 who can play in the Premiership\". The club rejected Given's request, which was then withdrawn by the goalkeeper, who later stated that his \"intention was simply to express [his] frustration at being left out of the team,\" and that he \"never had any intention of actually leaving the club.\" An injury to Harper led to Given being recalled to the first team, and he kept his place for the rest of the season.", "Given again found himself competing with Steve Harper during the following season.

Newcastle conceded a further three times away to Barcelona, beat Bayer Leverkusen at home and in Germany (with Given saving an Oliver Neuville penalty in the home tie), and drew with Inter at San Siro, however a 2\u20130 loss at home against Barcelona meant that the club finished third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages. Given played every game in the second round.
