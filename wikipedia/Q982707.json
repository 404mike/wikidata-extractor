John Florio contributed to the English language with 1,149 words, placing third after Chaucer (with 2,012 words) and Shakespeare (with 1,969 words), in the linguistic analysis conducted by Stanford professor John Willinsky.He was also the first translator of Montaigne into English, the first translator of Boccaccio into English and he wrote the first comprehensive Dictionary in English and Italian (surpassing the only previous modest Italian\u2013English dictionary by William Thomas published in 1550).Playwright and poet Ben Jonson was a personal friend of John Florio and Jonson hailed Florio as \"loving father\" and \"ayde of his muses\". In fact, the copy of the play Volpone written by Jonson and given to his friend John Florio, includes the following handwritten dedication: \"To his loving Father & worthy Friend Mr John Florio, The Ayde of his Muses, Ben: Jonson seakes this testimony of Friendship & Love\". Philosopher Giordano Bruno was also a personal friend of John Florio. Florio met the Italian philosopher Bruno in London, while both of them were residing at the French embassy. Bruno wrote and published in London his six most celebrated moral dialogues, including La cena de le ceneri (The Ash Wednesday Supper, 1584), in which Florio is mentioned as Bruno's companion.Many intertextual borrowings by Shakespeare from his works have been long attested, and persistent pseudo-scholarly attempts have been made to claim secret connections between Florio and Shakespeare, even asserting a putative identity of Florio with  the author of Shakespeare's works.", "link_mentions": {}}}
