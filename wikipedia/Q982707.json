John Florio contributed to the English language with 1,149 words, placing third after Chaucer (with 2,012 words) and Shakespeare (with 1,969 words), in the linguistic analysis conducted by Stanford professor John Willinsky.He was also the first translator of Montaigne into English, the first translator of Boccaccio into English and he wrote the first comprehensive Dictionary in English and Italian (surpassing the only previous modest Italian\u2013English dictionary by William Thomas published in 1550).Playwright and poet Ben Jonson was a personal friend of John Florio and Jonson hailed Florio as \"loving father\" and \"ayde of his muses\". In fact, the copy of the play Volpone written by Jonson and given to his friend John Florio, includes the following handwritten dedication: \"To his loving Father & worthy Friend Mr John Florio, The Ayde of his Muses, Ben: Jonson seakes this testimony of Friendship & Love\". Philosopher Giordano Bruno was also a personal friend of John Florio. Florio met the Italian philosopher Bruno in London, while both of them were residing at the French embassy. Bruno wrote and published in London his six most celebrated moral dialogues, including La cena de le ceneri (The Ash Wednesday Supper, 1584), in which Florio is mentioned as Bruno's companion.Many intertextual borrowings by Shakespeare from Florio's works have been long attested, and persistent pseudo-scholarly attempts have been made to claim secret connections between Florio and Shakespeare, even asserting a putative identity of Florio with  the author of Shakespeare's works.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glyph", "response": ["The word hieroglyph (Greek for sacred writing) has a longer history in English, dating from an early use in an English-to-Italian dictionary published by John Florio in 1598, referencing the complex and mysterious characters of the Egyptian alphabet."]}, {"page": "Giordano Bruno", "response": ["In April 1583, Bruno went to England with letters of recommendation from Henry III as a guest of the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau.

He also lectured at Oxford, and unsuccessfully sought a teaching position there. His views were controversial, notably with John Underhill, Rector of Lincoln College and subsequently bishop of Oxford, and George Abbot, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. Abbot mocked Bruno for supporting \"the opinion of Copernicus that the earth did go round, and the heavens did stand still; whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round, and his brains did not stand still\", and found Bruno had both plagiarized and misrepresented Ficino's work, leading Bruno to return to the continent.Hannam, James.

Thomas Kyd is frequently proposed as the author of the hypothetical Ur-Hamlet that may have been one of Shakespeare's primary sources for Hamlet."]}, {"page": "The Monkey and the Cat", "response": ["In La Fontaine's telling, Bertrand the monkey persuades Raton the cat to pull chestnuts from the embers amongst which they are roasting, promising him a share. As the cat scoops them from the fire one by one, burning his paw in the process, the monkey gobbles them up. They are disturbed by a maid entering and the cat gets nothing for its pains. It is from this fable that the French get their idiom Tirer les marrons du feu, meaning to act as someone's dupe or, deriving from that, to benefit from the dirty work of others. It is also the source of the English idiom 'a cat's paw', defined in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as 'one used by another as a tool'. There are earlier idiomatic allusions in 15th century Burgundian sources. Jean Mi\u00e9lot records the saying c'est un bon jeu de chat et singe (it's a cat and monkey game) in his Proverbes (1456) and there is another apparent reference to the story in a poem in Jean Molinet's  Faictz et dictz. In the following century, Jean-Antoine de Ba\u00eff has the version faire comme le singe, tirer les marrons du feu avec la patte du chat in his Mimes, enseignements et proverbes (1575)  and John Florio includes the saying in his collection of idioms Second Frutes (1591).Elizabeth Dawes, \"Pulling the chestnuts out of the fire\" in Animals and the symbolic in mediaeval art and literature (ed) L.A.J.R.
