By 1975, the population was 2\u20133\u00a0million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting.Stuart-Fox, William, The Murderous Revolution: Life & Death in Pol Pot's Kampuchea, Alternative Publishing Co-Operative Limited, 1985, pp. 17. The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on April 17, 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously\", inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians.Barron, John and Anthony Paul (1977), Murder of a Gentle Land, Reader's Digest Press, pp. 1\u20132. The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud wrote that \"I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin\";Ponchaud, Francois (1978), Cambodia Year Zero, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, pp. 6\u20137. Jon Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were \"tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen\".Swain, John (1999), River of Time: A Memoir of Vietnam and Cambodia, Berkley Trade. All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as \"new people\".Stuart-Fox, pp. 7. Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by Pol Pot's forces and was turned into the S-21 prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, \"lazy\", spies, or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields),  away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime."]}, {"page": "James Cameron (journalist)", "response": ["* 2000.

It was directed by Roland Joff\u00e9 and produced by David Puttnam for his company Goldcrest Films. Sam Waterston stars as Schanberg, Haing S.

The adaptation for the screen was written by Bruce Robinson; the musical score was written by Mike Oldfield and orchestrated by David Bedford.", "Two years later, in 1975, the Phnom Penh embassies are evacuated in anticipation of the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran, his wife and their four children. However, Pran insists on staying behind to help Schanberg. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital, ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg meets Rockoff. They are later met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. The group is taken through the city to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates to spare the lives of his friends. They do not leave Phnom Penh, but instead retreat to the French embassy. The Khmer Rouge orders all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over. Fearing an attack from the Khmer Rouge, the ambassador complies. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Jon Swain of The Sunday Times try to forge a British passport for Pran, but the deception fails when the image of Pran on the passport photo fades to nothing, as they lack adequate photographic fixer. Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and is forced to live under their totalitarian regime."]}, {"page": "Sisowath Sirik Matak", "response": ["Shortly after the surrender to the Khmer Rouge was announced, Sirik Matak sought refuge at the Hotel Le Phnom, where the International Red Cross was attempting to create a safe zone.
