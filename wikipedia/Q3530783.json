The only IRA body that supported this viewpoint was the outgoing IRA Executive. Those members of the outgoing Executive who opposed the change comprised a quorum. They met, dismissed those in favour of the change, and set up a new Executive. They contacted Tom Maguire, who was a commander in the old IRA and had supported the Provisionals against the Official IRA (see Irish republican legitimatism), and asked him for support. Maguire had also been contacted by supporters of Gerry Adams, then president of Sinn F\u00e9in, and a supporter of the change in the Provisional IRA constitution.", "Maguire rejected Adams' supporters, supported the IRA Executive members opposed to the change, and named the new organisers the Continuity Army Council.Robert White, Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. 2006.

Although the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na had suspicions that the organisation existed, they were unsure of its name, labelling it the \"Irish National Republican Army\". On 21 January 1994, on the 75th anniversary of the First D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, Continuity IRA volunteers offered a \"final salute\" to Tom Maguire by firing over his grave, and a public statement and a photo were published in Saoirse Irish Freedom.\"Final Salute to Comdt-General Tom Maguire\", Saoirse, Feabhra-February 1994, p. 2; see also, Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. 2006. Indiana University Press, pp. 323\u201324. In February 1994 it was reported that in previous months Garda\u00ed had found arms dumps along the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth that did not belong to the Provisional IRA, and forensics tests determined had been used for firing practice recently.IRA splinter group threat to ceasefire\", Irish Independent, 5 February 1994.", " Similar to the claim put forward by the Provisional IRA after its split from the Official IRA in 1969, the Continuity IRA claims to be the legitimate continuation of the original Irish Republican Army or \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann. This argument is based on the view that the surviving anti-Treaty members of the Second D\u00e1il delegated their \"authority\" to the IRA Army Council in 1938. As further justification for this claim, Tom Maguire, one of those anti-Treaty members of the Second D\u00e1il, issued a statement in favour of the Continuity IRA, just as he had done in 1969 in favour of the Provisionals. J. Bowyer Bell, in his The Irish Troubles, describes Maguire's opinion in 1986: \"abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism, a moral issue of principle. Abstentionism gave the movement legitimacy, the right to wage war, to speak for a Republic all but established in the hearts of the people\".J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, The IRA, Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, , p. 575. Maguire's stature was such that a delegation from Gerry Adams sought his support in 1986, but was rejected.Robert W.

In 1938, a group calling itself the Executive Council of the Second D\u00e1il delegated its self-declared authority to the IRA Army Council. The Irish Republican Army ultimately ceased military operations against Ireland in 1948, but continued to consider itself the legitimate government of Ireland. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) split with the original IRA in December 1969 and afterward claimed that it was the sole legitimate representative of the Irish Republic. It based its claim, in part, on the support of Second D\u00e1il member Tom Maguire. The PIRA conducted a campaign of bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until 1998, and its political wing, the modern Sinn F\u00e9in party, used to insist that the Irish Republic was still legally in existence, with the Provisional IRA as its national army, and the IRA Army Council Ireland's sole legitimate government. This view is still upheld by Republican Sinn F\u00e9in and the Continuity IRA. Until their disbandment, the Provisional IRA continued to use the title  (lit. Volunteers of Ireland), the official Irish title for the Irish Defence Forces. Continuity IRA based their claims in part on the support they received from the last surviving anti-treaty Second D\u00e1il member, Tom Maguire."]}, {"page": "Second D\u00e1il", "response": ["In 1925 an [anti-Treaty] IRA convention withdrew its allegiance from the republican government to its own Army Council. Second D\u00e1il TDs had taken an oath of fidelity to the Irish Republic, and Sinn F\u00e9in regarded those who implicitly or explicitly endorsed the Treaty or Free State constitution as having violated this oath and thereby vacated their seats. In 1926 de Valera founded Fianna F\u00e1il to take a more pragmatic opposition than Sinn F\u00e9in to the Free State, and the following year the party abandoned abstentionism by entering the Free State D\u00e1il. Fianna F\u00e1il TD Se\u00e1n Lemass famously described it in March 1928 as \"a slightly constitutional party\". De Valera came to power in 1932 and in 1937 proposed a new Constitution which was adopted by plebiscite, removing to his own satisfaction any remaining reservations about the state's legitimacy. In December 1938, seven of those elected in 1921 who continued to regard the Second D\u00e1il as the last legitimate D\u00e1il assembly, and that all other surviving members had disqualified themselves by taking the oath of allegiance, gathered at a meeting with the IRA Army Council under Se\u00e1n Russell, and signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council until such a time as a new D\u00e1il could once again be democratically elected by all the people of Ireland in all 32 counties.The seven were John J. O'Kelly, George Noble Plunkett, William Stockley, Mary MacSwiney, Brian O'Higgins, Tom Maguire and Cathal \u00d3 Murchadha. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic. Official Sinn F\u00e9in in 1969\u201370 and Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in in 1986 abandoned abstentionism and began a gradual  recognition of the legitimacy of the modern Irish state; the smaller Republican Sinn F\u00e9in retains the view that the Second D\u00e1il was the last legitimate Irish legislature."]}, {"page": "Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh", "response": ["* Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, D\u00edlseacht \u2013 The Story of Comdt General Tom Maguire and the Second (All-Ireland) D\u00e1il, Dublin: Irish Freedom Press, 1997, "]}]}}
