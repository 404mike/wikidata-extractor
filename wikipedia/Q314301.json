Movies like this are hardly ever made at all; when they're made this well, they're precious cinematic miracles.\" The New York Timess Janet Maslin wrote that, even though \"the cast is unknown, the director has a spotty history, and the basic premise falls into this year's most hackneyed category ... the finished product is wonderful. Here is a movie so fresh and funny it didn't even need a big budget or a pedigree.\" The Variety magazine review concluded that \"though its plot wins no points for originality, Breaking Away is a thoroughly delightful light comedy, lifted by fine performances from Dennis Christopher and Paul Dooley.\" Critic Dave Kehr, however, gave a later, somewhat dissenting opinion: \"Released at a time when any small-scale film earned critical favor simply by virtue of its unpretentiousness, Breaking Away probably looked better in context than it does now.\" However, he conceded that \"Peter Yates lends the film a fine, unexpected limpidity, and the principals are mostly excellent.\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 41 reviews, with a rating average of 8.2/10.
