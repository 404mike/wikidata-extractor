Considered as one of the best right backs in the world.\nBorn and raised in Sheffield, Walker started his career at his boyhood club Sheffield United which he had joined at the age of seven. He was promoted to the first-team where he made his full Sheffield United debut at 18 years old against Leyton Orient after a loan spell at Northampton Town. He impressed whilst playing for the Blades and played in the 2009 Championship play-off final in their defeat against Burnley. His performances earned him a move to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, before being immediately loaned back to Sheffield United. After further loan spells at Queens Park Rangers and Aston Villa, he cemented his place in Tottenham's first team. His performances earned him a call-up to the England national team where he made his debut against Spain. After five more seasons at Tottenham, Walker joined Manchester City for a fee of \u00a345 million. Walker has subsequently won three Premier League titles, four EFL Cup trophies and one FA Cup whilst at City. He has also played for England at UEFA Euro 2016, the 2018 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2020. He has been named in the PFA Team of the Year three times in: 2011\u201312, 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 28", "response": ["*1990 \u2013 Kyle Walker, English international footballer"]}, {"page": "1990", "response": ["** Kyle Walker, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Walker (surname)", "response": ["*Kyle Walker (born 1990), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Sheffield United F.C.", "response": ["Sheffield United's Academy is responsible for youth development at the club.

This signing was followed by the arrival of Jean Makoun from Houllier's former club Lyon, before Sunderland's Darren Bent was brought to Villa Park in a deal that broke the club's transfer record. Villa's January transfer window was rounded off with the loan signing of American international midfielder Michael Bradley from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. In February 2011, Houllier criticised the commitment of Villa defenders Habib Beye and Stephen Warnock. The pair were forced to train with the club's reserve side and were not selected by the Frenchman, even when the club faced even more injury concerns. After the defeat to Sunderland, Villa underwent a revival, winning five and drawing three of their next nine matches in the league and FA Cup, including defeating Manchester City 1\u20130 in a run which saw the team climb to 12th."]}, {"page": "Tunisia national football team", "response": ["Tunisia's qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and its positive results in the friendlies against Iran and Costa Rica led to its rise to 14th place in the FIFA World Rankings for the first time ever, after being first in African teams and surpassing teams like Italy and Netherlands. The team also continued its good results before the World Cup, with a draw with Turkey and Portugal, with the same score 2\u20132, in addition to a difficult defeat against Spain 1\u20130 in the 85th minute. Despite this, in the World Cup, the performance of the team did not rise to the expected level, and was once again eliminated from the group stage. The first match against England, the two teams had met in two matches, including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, an England 2\u20130 victory. England scored in the 11th minute when Mouez Hassen stopped a John Stones' header from a corner from the left, but could not save a Harry Kane follow-up from close range. Hassen was substituted four minutes later for Farouk Ben Mustapha due to an injury earlier in the game, after he had a collision with Jesse Lingard. Lingard then mishit a volley from Ashley Young's cross to the far post. After 10 minutes, Ferjani Sassi equalised from the penalty spot after Kyle Walker was penalised for an elbow on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Kane had an appeal for a penalty waved away within five minutes of the restart as he was seemingly impeded by a pair of Tunisia players at a corner. In the additional time, Harry Maguire flicked a Kieran Trippier corner from the right into the path of Kane, who headed it inside the goal after being left free at the back post.The second match against Belgium, the two teams had faced each other in three matches, including one game at the 2002 FIFA World Cup group stage, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Just 6 minutes into the game, Syam Ben Youssef's late challenge on Eden Hazard was deemed, with the use of VAR, to have been just inside the area and he stepped up to score the penalty into the bottom-left corner. Ten minutes later, Dries Mertens won possession just inside the Tunisia half before driving forward and passing the ball to Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku then shot a low strike across Farouk Ben Mustapha into the bottom-right corner. Wahbi Khazri's free-kick from the left was met by Dylan Bronn, who flashed a header past Thibaut Courtois. Thomas Meunier found Lukaku inside the area, which he clipped over the onrushing Mustapha. Toby Alderweireld's long pass from defence was taken on the chest by Hazard, who then rounded Mustapha to stroke into an empty net. Michy Batshuayi met Youri Tielemans' cross at the back post with a controlled half-volley to score Belgium's 5th. Khazri scored deep into stoppage time after a swivel in the box. Tunisia, it has registered as their worst defeat ever in their World Cup history."]}, {"page": "Alan Hutton", "response": ["However, at the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season, Tottenham Hotspur right-back Kyle Walker was regularly chosen ahead of Hutton in defence following his return from a loan spell away at Villa Park. Hutton was heavily linked with a \u00a33 million transfer to Aston Villa, the club that Walker had recently returned from. After joining Aston Villa, Hutton made accusations towards Harry Redknapp of making his life a misery by training with the youth side and that he was treated as an 'outcast' during his three years spell at Tottenham Hotspur."]}, {"page": "England national football team records and statistics", "response": ["|align=center| Kyle Walker"]}, {"page": "Cuffley", "response": ["Its most notable current resident is Sir Terry Leahy, former CEO of Tesco, although this did not prevent locals from objecting vehemently to plans to build a  \"Express\" store in the village replacing one of only two remaining village pubs.Daily Telegraph on-line 23 July 2007 Other famous residents include Premier League footballers Ledley King, Jermain Defoe, Niko Kranjcar, David Bentley, Kyle Walker and Armand Traor\u00e9; and also former Sugababes singer Keisha Buchanan and Myleene Klass."]}, {"page": "Darren Bent", "response": ["On 17 January 2011, Bent submitted a transfer request, amid reports that Aston Villa had made a club-record \u00a318\u00a0million bid for him, which was rejected. Villa then submitted an improved offer of \u00a318\u00a0million, potentially rising to \u00a324\u00a0million, which was then accepted. The following day, Bent completed his move to Villa and signed a four-and-a-half-year deal. He scored the winning goal on his debut against Manchester City in a 1\u20130 victory at Villa Park. Bent scored his second Villa goal in his third appearance for his team when he completed the full 90 minutes against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 3\u20131 away defeat. Bent scored both of Villa's goals in their 2\u20131 away victory over Arsenal in the penultimate match of the season on 15 May. The first was a nicely crafted volley after he chested down a Kyle Walker chipped pass, with the second coming a few minutes later after a slip from Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen allowed Ashley Young the time to thread a pass through the Gunners' defence and Bent to sidefoot home for 2\u20130. He finished the season with 9 goals in 16 Premier League appearances for Villa, becoming the club's joint top-scorer with Ashley Young, despite only joining in January.
