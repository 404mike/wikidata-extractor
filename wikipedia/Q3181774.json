Each piece represented an aspect of New Brunswick culture or industry. The second floor had a welded metal sculpture by Claude Roussel representing forestry. On the third floor three miners were depicted by Bruno Bobak in relief on plywood. On the  fourth floor was Jack Humphrey's glass mosaic tile mural of coastal fishermen. Farming was represented on the fifth floor by a sheet metal construction by Tom Forrestall, and a painting by  Fred Ross on the sixth floor reflected the province's literary heritage."]}]}}
