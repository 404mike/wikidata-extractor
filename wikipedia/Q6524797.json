This is the approach that is used below. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella. Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, countable) but discrete setting."]}, {"page": "Covering system", "response": ["The Mirsky\u2013Newman theorem, a special case of the Herzog\u2013Sch\u00f6nheim conjecture, states that there is no disjoint distinct covering system.
