On 9 June, Crewe's promotion to League One was confirmed, but Swindon were crowned League Two champions on the basis of average points per game. Artell was selected as League Two Manager of the Year in the League Managers Association Awards\u2014becoming the first Crewe manager to win such an annual award\u2014and two Academy graduates, Perry Ng and Charlie Kirk, were named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year.

Five days later Vale lost 2\u20131 at home to Crawley after Smith gave away a penalty and scored an own goal, though the penalty decision of referee Mike Jones was highly contentious; Aspin called the referee's performance 'diabolical'. Newly crowned EFL Trophy champions Lincoln visited Vale Park on 14 April, and Vale all but secured their safety on that day after Kay scored the winner on 63 minutes. Vale set up defensively at Mansfield and managed to rescue a point after a late equalising goal from Pope cancelled out a clumsy own goal; after match Aspin summarised the season by saying that \"I think they have done well, from the position they were in, to getting to safety.\" Angus scored on his home debut on 28 April, but this was not enough to prevent the final match of the season at Vale Park being a 2\u20131 defeat to Carlisle United, much to Aspin's disappointment."]}]}}
