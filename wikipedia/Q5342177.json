So from 1922 the colleges were loosely coordinated through a Federation, which from 1960 was headed by a President, and theology was taught by a central Department of Mission. Social Studies (which included Development Studies) and later English were added later. In the 1970s the numbers of Christian missionaries being sent overseas by UK-based missionary societies declined, and the 'missionary colleges' increasingly provided training and experience for church leaders and administrators from across the developing world, who could also sit for certificates or diplomas awarded by Westhill College or diplomas or degrees awarded by the Department of Mission, in association with the Theology Department at the University of Birmingham, whose first Professor of Theology, from 1940, was endowed  by the Quaker Edward Cadbury. Its initial occupant was H. G. Wood, who had been Director of Studies at Woodbrooke College. In 1970 Quakers endowed a Chair of Mission Studies shared between the Colleges\u2019 Department of Mission and the University Department of Theology, and they were also influential in creating a Chair in Pastoral Theology (now more often called Practical Theology) at the University.
