Singer Sharleen Spiteri has the perfect voice for this kind of thing: it's low-pitched and dark-hued, and is shown off to best effect when she's belting out big, cathartic numbers like the title track and \"Why Believe in You.\" Ally McErlaine is a brilliant slide guitarist who can move from grungy, greasy rock to desolate acoustic Delta blues without missing a beat. It's true that the group still needs to digest its influences a bit -- \"Dream Hotel,\" in particular, sounds like a U2 reject\u2014but most of the time, Texas does a good job of mapping out its own territory.
