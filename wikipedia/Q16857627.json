He was presented to the rectory of St. Lawrence, Winchester, in 1788, and was appointed second master of Winchester College in 1793. He graduated M.A. at Cambridge University in 1807; succeeded Dr. Goddard as head-master of Winchester College in 1810; was presented to the rectory of Ashow, Warwickshire, in 1812, and that of Binfield, Berkshire, in 1820; resigned the head-mastership of Winchester College in December 1823, receiving a present of plate richly engraved from the scholars.

In 1820 Thomas Burgess, then bishop of St David's, offered him the vicarage of Lampeter, hoping that he would carry on the school established there by Eliezer Williams; he accepted, and Lampeter was selected as the home of the divinity school later known as St David's College, Lampeter. The foundation-stone was laid in 1822, but, having clashed with Burgess, Williams was not appointed its principal."]}]}}
