Odeon cinemas were considered more comfortable and respectable for middle-class filmgoers than those of the two other circuits, Associated British Cinemas (ABC) and Gaumont-British Cinemas. Odeons were known for their art deco architecture, first used on the Odeon, Kingstanding to a design by Cecil Clavering, working for Harry Weedon. Although Clavering only designed three further Odeons, at Sutton Coldfield, Colwyn Bay and Scarborough, \"one masterpiece after the other\" considered \"the finest expressions of the Odeon circuit style\".  Later in 1935, however, Clavering stunned Weedon by resigning to take up a job with the Office of Works. Weedon approached Clavering's former tutor who recommended Robert Bullivant as Clavering's replacement and Weedon was commissioned by Deutsch to oversee the design of the entire chain."]}, {"page": "Harry Weedon", "response": ["Weedon returned to Birmingham and to architecture in 1925, quickly building up his practice designing housing estates and commercial and industrial premises. It was his work in 1932 designing the enlargement of a factory in Hockley, Birmingham for the firm of Deutsch and Brenner that brought him to the attention of Oscar Deutsch \u2013 the factory's owner's son \u2013 who was in the process of building up his Odeon chain of cinemas and was dissatisfied with the interior proposed for his cinema under construction in Warley near Birmingham. Weedon was approached by Deutsch to complete the design, but at the time his office numbered only six staff and had nobody other than Weedon himself with any cinema experience, so the young Cecil Clavering was recruited to complete the work."]}, {"page": "Kingstanding", "response": ["In 1935, an Odeon cinema, designed by Cecil Clavering, was opened on Kingstanding Circle.

At night, the rotunda's 15 vertical bands of windows were illuminated by approximately 1,500 light bulbs each,BF-Architekten, \"Modernisierung Wohnanlage Gartenstadt Atlantic, Berlin\", p. 2 (pdf)  red illuminated letters 1.2\u00a0metres high spelled out \"Lichtburg\" above the roofline, and 3 rotating searchlights mounted on the roof raked the sky from under them. In addition to drawing attention to itself amongst the residential buildings, the building thus embodied the principle of cinema \u2013 the projection of light into the darkness. The night-time appearance of the cinema was widely depicted and probably influenced Cecil Clavering's striking design for the Odeon in Kingstanding, with its tall central fins on which the architect originally intended a searchlight to be mounted.Allen Eyles, Odeon Cinemas, 2 volumes, volume 1: Oscar Deutsch Entertains Our Nation, London: Cinema Theatre Association, British Film Institute, 2002, , p. 57.: \"The original idea was for a searchlight to be mounted on the fins which would scan the night sky, like at the Lichtburg in Berlin. This idea was dropped when Deutsch took over [the cinema]\"."]}, {"page": "1971 New Year Honours", "response": ["* John Cecil Clavering, Superintending Architect, Department of the Environment."]}, {"page": "Odeon, Kingstanding", "response": ["The cinema was constructed between 1935 and 1936 to a symmetrical, modernist, art deco design by Harry Weedon and Cecil Clavering, the latter having joined the former's practice, as an assistant, in 1933. It was commissioned as an independent cinema, and was due to be called \"The Beacon\", after nearby Barr Beacon, but Oscar Deutsch became involved, and the cinema opened as part of his Odeon chain on 22 July 1935. It was built to serve Kingstanding's new, 4,000-home working-class housing estate and had 968 seats in the stalls and 324 in the circle.
