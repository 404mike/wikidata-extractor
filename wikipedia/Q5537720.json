In 1910 he left football to devote himself full-time to his family hotel business, but was persuaded to return to The Dell by reserve team manager George Carter the following year. In March 1912, following the dismissal of first choice centre forward Henry Hamilton for a serious breach of club discipline, Christmas was drafted into the first team. Despite his \"pace and dribbling skills\" he was not a success and he returned to the reserves."]}, {"page": "George Carter (footballer born 1867)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Carter (footballer, born 1866)"]}, {"page": "George Carter (footballer, born 1867)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Carter (footballer, born 1866)"]}]}}
