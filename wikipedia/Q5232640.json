According to Huntford, Scott \"disappears from naval records\" for eight months, from mid-August 1889 until 26 March 1890. Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman, a cover-up, and protection by senior officers. Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks, but is unable to clarify further. He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well-connected enough to warrant this. Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records.", "In 2005 David Crane published a new Scott biography in which he comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates \"so wholly obscured by legend\". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott \"free from the baggage of earlier interpretations\". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the \"hopeless heroism and obscene waste\" of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that made Britain, indeed the British Empire, great were not extinct. Future generations mindful of the carnage that started  years later, the ideals of unquestionable duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring.", "Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, \"far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data.\" Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that \"in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years\". The New York Times Book Review was more critical, pointing out Crane's support for Scott's account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery from the pack ice, and concluded that \"For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise.\""]}, {"page": "Chronology of Shakespeare's plays", "response": [":Additional information (publication): the 1602 quarto text has traditionally been considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W.

This prevented them from reaching the glacier summit until 13 November. They then marched on beyond Armitage's furthest point, discovered the Polar Plateau and became the first party to travel on it. After the return of geological and supporting parties, Scott, Evans and Lashly continued westward across the featureless plain for another eight days, covering a distance of about 150 miles to reach their most westerly point on 30 November. Having lost their navigational tables in a gale during the glacier ascent, they did not know exactly where they were, and had no landmarks to help them fix a position. The return journey to the Ferrar Glacier was undertaken in conditions which limited them to no more than a mile an hour, with supplies running low and dependent on Scott's rule of thumb navigation. On the descent of the glacier Scott and Evans survived a potentially fatal fall into a crevasse, before the discovery of a snow-free area or dry valley, a rare Antarctic phenomenon. Lashly described the dry valley as \"a splendid place for growing spuds\". The party reached Discovery on 24 December, after a round trip of seven hundred miles covered in 59 days. Their daily average of over 14 miles on this man-hauling journey was significantly better than that achieved with dogs on the previous season's southern journey, a fact which further strengthened Scott's prejudices against dogs. Polar historian David Crane calls the western journey \"one of the great journeys of polar history\"."]}, {"page": "Terra Nova Expedition", "response": ["To head his scientific programme, Scott appointed Edward Wilson as chief scientist.

Huntford was critical of Scott's supposedly authoritarian leadership style and of his poor judgment of men, and blamed him for a series of organisational failures that led to the death of everyone in the polar party. Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct rebuttal of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of Scott, and Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying that the dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp."]}, {"page": "David Crane (Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Crane (historian) "]}, {"page": "Controversies surrounding Robert Falcon Scott", "response": ["Susan Solomon's summary of meteorological data for the Ross Ice Shelf during February and March 1912 advances the theory that the death of Scott's party was due to the extreme weather conditions that prevailed at that time, rather than to organisational failure.Solomon, pp.\u00a0309\u2013327\u00a0 This conclusion is generally supported by David Crane in his 2005 biography, although faults are acknowledged.Crane, pp.\u00a0576\u2013581."]}]}}
