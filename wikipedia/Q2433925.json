He was the general secretary of the Church Mission Society (CMS) and the South American Missionary Society (SAMS) prior to his consecration.  He was appointed as Bishop of Winchester in 2011, and, as such became an ex officio member of the House of Lords. From 2013 he served as the Bishop for Higher and Further Education.\nIn May 2021, Dakin \"stepped back\" as diocesan bishop, in response to the threat of a motion of no confidence in his leadership in the diocesan synod, and Debbie Sellin, Bishop of Southampton, took over from him as acting bishop of Winchester on a temporary basis. In July 2021, Dakin announced his retirement as bishop with effect from February 2022.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Corpus Christi College, Oxford", "response": ["The Visitor of the college is ex officio the Bishop of Winchester, currently Tim Dakin."]}, {"page": "King's College London", "response": ["Notable King's alumni to have held senior positions in British politics include two Speakers of the House of Commons (Lord Maybray-King and Lord Ullswater) and the former Cabinet ministers Lord Watkinson, Lord Passfield and Lord Wilmot.
