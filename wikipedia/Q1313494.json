Written by Jean Benedetti the play was entitled The Good Shoe Maker and the Poor Fish Pedlar. John Bailey played Bartolomeo Vanzetti, an Italian immigrant in America whose execution was widely regarded as having been a miscarriage of justice.\nHe also made various appearances in Doctor Who, including \"The Sensorites\" (1964), playing Edward Waterfield in \"The Evil of the Daleks\" (1967) and \"The Horns of Nimon\" (1979-80), as well as appearing in several episodes of The Avengers and as Hans Frank in the 1978 American television miniseries Holocaust.", "link_mentions": {}}}
