It was first broadcast on BBC 1 in eight series between 1974 and 1981, totalling 56 episodes in all. Each episode ran for 30 minutes. The title comes from the first episode, in which young Gunner Parkin (Christopher Mitchell) writes home to his mother in England.  The series has been accused of racism, homophobia and of pandering to imperialism.", "It Ain't Half Hot, Mum is set during the Second World War (in the period just after the German surrender when the Allies were trying to finish the war by defeating Japan in Asia). The scripts make clear that the performers are members of a Royal Artillery concert party and are thus enlisted soldiers, rather than being members of ENSA. Initially, the British soldiers are stationed at the Royal Artillery Depot in Deolali, British India, where soldiers were kept before being sent to fight at the front lines. The series used the experiences of its creators during the Second World War; Jimmy Perry had been a member of a similar performing troupe in India, while David Croft had been an entertainments officer in Poona (now in the Indian state of Maharashtra).", "The series, which attracted up to 17 million viewers during its run, is no longer repeated on British television, as it is said to fall short of modern broadcasting standards concerning racism. \"It is without doubt the funniest series that David Croft and I wrote.

A frequently recurring gag connected with Rangi Ram is his continual references to \"we British\" and \"us British\" while at the same time referring to the other Indian characters as \"ignorant coolies\" or \"damned natives\". Bates was born in India to English parents but had learned to speak Urdu, which he used during the show and had fought in the Burma Campaign giving him some insight into his characterisation. David West Brown wrote, in English and Empire, that the case for Bates' character rests on an assumption that his \"dramatic and social functions are not derogatorily comic in the way that depictions of African diaspora identities are\" in a series like The Black and White Minstrel Show. The BBC website article about the series describes Bates as having \"blacked up\".", "Perry told an interviewer from Radio Times in 2014 about this rejection: \"You might as well be in Stalin's Russia.
