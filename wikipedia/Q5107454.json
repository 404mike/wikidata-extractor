However, Gary doesn't show up at the hospital while Nicola is giving birth upon making a discovery - Phelan has resurfaced. He plans to get revenge on Phelan for what he did to his family over the past four years and ends up tracking him from his hiding place in Albergele. Gary then calls his ex-militant associate, Joe Haslam (Chord Melodic), to help with his plans - though Joe initially refuses at first and leaves Gary on his own. However, after Phelan overpowers Gary upon being attacked, Joe returns and knocks Phelan unconscious before he could harm Gary. Together, they bring Phelan back to Weatherfield and hold him captive in the yard - where Sarah returns and discovers the situation just as Joe leaves the area. As Gary attempts to stop Sarah from calling the police whilst ignoring her efforts to talk him out of revenge, Phelan manages to free himself and subdues Gary by hitting him with a chair. Phelan then retrieves his gun, locks Gary and Sarah in the yard, and proceeds to confront Eileen and Nicola so he could get to see Zack. While attempting to escape, Gary and Sarah are released from their captivity by Anna - who herself has been released from prison at the time Phelan was presumed dead. The trio promptly rush off to stop Phelan, who ends up shooting Nicola after she tried to disarm him. As Anna heads down to confront Phelan at the Bistro, where he has instigated, Gary retrieves Zack in his arms whilst Sarah rushes over to Eileen and Seb - who were both knocked unconscious by Phelan during the struggle. Eventually, Anna prevents Phelan from escaping Weatherfield by stabbing him with a knife - though not before the latter ended up shooting the restaurant's co-owner Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh); however, she survives whilst Phelan dies from Anna's stabbing. Following Phelan's death, Anna leaves Weatherfield and Gary manages to make amends with Nicola after she discovers that he was the reason behind Phelan's siege. Nicola eventually leaves Weatherfield with Zack, despite Gary's initial protests."]}, {"page": "Chris Michael Hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chord Melodic"]}, {"page": "Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)", "response": ["In May 2018, Phelan takes refugee at a caravan park in Abergele \u2014 where he uses a false identity on a mother's social group to keep in contact with an oblivious Nicola. Towards the end of the month, Gary becomes suspicious with her mysterious contact and quickly finds out that it was Phelan after tracking his location in Wales \u2014 with help from his army friend, Joe Haslam (Chord Melodic). Intending to finish him for good, Gary attacks Phelan with a bat; however, he is quickly subdued and is on the verge of getting killed when Joe intervenes, knocking out Phelan with a rock. The pair brought Phelan back to Weatherfield and held him captive in the builder's yard, where Gary had planned to get revenge on him for what he did to his family. As Joe left Gary to proceed with his plan, however, Sarah confronted him and ended up discovering Phelan's captivity. As Sarah argued with Gary when he refuses to get the police involved about his return, Phelan is discovered by Kevin's young son Jack (Kyran Bowes) \u2014 whom he previously helped rescue Anna back on New Year's Day 2017 \u2014 and he attempts to bribe the youngster with a tender into setting him free. Jack nearly takes Phelan's bait until Gary and Sarah arrived back in the room; the couple manage to talk Jack out of freeing Phelan before sending him away, with the promise that he never saw Phelan. Once Jack has gone, Phelan taunts Gary with constant remarks about his mother that caused the latter to brutally hit his enemy with a plank of wood. When Sarah once again tries to convince Gary into calling the police, Phelan manages to free himself \u2014 thanks to Jack's earlier help \u2014 and attacks Gary with a chair. He then locked the builder's yard gate, retrieved his firearm, and forced the couple back into the garage. Holding them at gunpoint, Phelan orders Sarah to contact Nicola with Gary's phone and request that she come to the yard. Sarah instead calls Tim, not knowing that she is actually speaking to Kevin on the phone, to trick Phelan into thinking that she called Nicola; however, Phelan deduces this when Nicola doesn't turn up and he forces Gary to relinquish the code access on his phone \u2014 threatening to harm Sarah otherwise. After firing his unloaded gun at Sarah when she confirms his suspicions out of fear, Phelan locks her and Gary in the yard. He then makes his way discreetly over to Eileen's house, where she and Seb are looking after Nicola and Zac \u2014 who was merely born just moments ago. After tricking Nicola into telling him in, Phelan forces his way into the house where he meets Zac and spitefully tells Eileen that their \"marriage\" meant nothing \u2014 stating that it was all part of his original plan to cover-up his crimes. When Nicola attempts to prevent her father from coming near Zac, he threatens to shoot her. However, Seb secretly comes down the stairs and attacks Phelan with a screwdriver. Despite the efforts of the three attempting to subdue Phelan, he overpowers them \u2014 knocking out Eileen and Seb, but unintentionally shooting Nicola in the process."]}, {"page": "Chris Hall (English footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chord Melodic"]}]}}
