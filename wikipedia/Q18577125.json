She was born to two of the largest landowners in Scotland, being the third daughter of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and his wife Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower. A childhood bout of poliomyelitis caused paralysis and required her to wear leg braces for the rest of her life.\nIn 1882, Lady Victoria experienced a \"second consecration\" and dedicated the rest of her life to helping those who lived on the islands throughout Argyll. She frequently visited the island of Tiree, where she championed social and religious organisations, and moved there in 1891. She also anonymously promoted the island, sending details of the plight of islanders in regular letters to the British press. In 1911 Victoria's sister Frances Balfour published a posthumous biography of her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll", "response": ["*Lady Victoria Campbell (22 May 1854 \u2013 6 July 1910)."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Campbell, Duchess of Argyll", "response": ["* Lady Victoria Campbell (22 May 1854 \u2013 6 July 1910)"]}, {"page": "Victoria Campbell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lady Victoria Campbell"]}]}}
