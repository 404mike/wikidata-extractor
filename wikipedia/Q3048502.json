The two formed a high ideal of the tutorial office as clerical and pastoral rather than secular, which led to tensions in the college. Newman assisted Whately in his popular work Elements of Logic (1826, initially for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana), and from him gained a definite idea of the Christian Church as institution: \"a Divine appointment, and as a substantive body, independent of the State, and endowed with rights, prerogatives and powers of its own\".", "Newman was at home again in Oxford on 9 July 1833 and, on 14 July, Keble preached at St Mary's an assize sermon on \"National Apostasy\", which Newman afterwards regarded as the inauguration of the Oxford Movement. In the words of Richard William Church, it was \"Keble who inspired, Froude who gave the impetus, and Newman who took up the work\"; but the first organisation of it was due to Hugh James Rose, editor of the British Magazine, who has been styled \"the Cambridge originator of the Oxford Movement\". Rose met Oxford Movement figures on a visit to Oxford looking for magazine contributors, and it was in his rectory house at Hadleigh, Suffolk, that a meeting of High Church clergy was held over 25\u201326 July (Newman was not present, but Hurrell Froude, Arthur Philip Perceval, and William Palmer had gone to visit Rose), at which it was resolved to fight for \"the apostolical succession and the integrity of the Prayer Book\".", "In Newman's letters and memoranda and those of his friends, a more outgoing and humorous character is revealed. Newman lived in the world of his time, travelling by train as soon as engines were built and rail lines laid, and writing amusing letters about his adventures on railwaysTrevor and Caldecott, p. 56. and ships, and during his travels in Scotland and Ireland. He was an indefatigable walker, and as a young don at Oriel he often went out riding with Hurrell Froude and other friends.Trevor and Caldecott, p. 55. At Oxford he had an active pastoral life as an Anglican priest, though nothing of it appears in the Apologia. Later he was active as a Catholic priest. His parishioners at the Oratory, apart from a few professional men and their families, were mainly factory workers, Irish immigrants, and tradespeople. He was a caring pastor, and their recorded reminiscences show that they held him in affection.Trevor and Caldecott, p. 58.", "Strachey was only ten when Newman died and never met him. In contrast to Strachey's account, James Anthony Froude, Hurrell Froude's brother, who knew Newman at Oxford, saw him as a Carlylean hero.James Eli Adams. Dandies and Desert Saints: Styles of Victorian Masculinity. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1995, p. 82. . Compared with Newman, Froude wrote, Keble, Pusey, and the other Tractarians \"were all but as ciphers, and he the indicating number\". Newman's face was \"remarkably like that of Julius Caesar. ...I have often thought of the resemblance, and believed that it extended to the temperament. In both there was an original force of character which refused to be moulded by circumstances, which was to make its own way, and become a power in the world; a clearness of intellectual perception, a disdain for conventionalities, a temper imperious and wilful, but along with it a most attaching gentleness, sweetness, singleness of heart and purpose. Both were formed by nature to command others, both had the faculty of attracting to themselves the passionate devotion of their friends and followers. ...For hundreds of young men Credo in Newmannum was the veritable symbol of faith.\"Quoted in Wilfred Ward, The Genius of Cardinal Newman: Lecture 1", "Newman also experienced intense male friendships, the first with Richard Hurrell Froude (1803\u20131836), the longest with Ambrose St John (1815\u20131875), who shared communitarian life with Newman for 32 years starting in 1843 (when St John was 28).J. H. Rigg, Oxford High Anglicanism and its Chief Leaders, London, 1895. Newman wrote after St John's death: \"I have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husband's or a wife's, but I feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater, or any one's sorrow greater, than mine\".Charles Dessain. The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman Volume IX: Littlemore and the Parting of Friends May 1842October 1843. London: Thomas Nelson & Sons. He directed that he be buried in the same grave as St John: \"I wish, with all my heart, to be buried in Fr Ambrose St John's grave\u2014and I give this as my last, my imperative will\".Newman, \"Written in prospect of death\", 23 July 1876, in Meditations and Devotions \u2013 Part 3", "David Hilliard characterises Geoffrey Faber's description of Newman, in his 1933 book Oxford Apostles, as a \"portrait of Newman as a sublimated homosexual (though the word itself was not used)\".David Hilliard. \"UnEnglish and Unmanly: Anglo-Catholicism and Homosexuality\", p. 4. Originally published in Victorian Studies, Winter 1982, pp. 181\u2013210. On Newman's relations with Hurrell Froude, Faber wrote: \"Of all his friends Froude filled the deepest place in his heart, and I'm not the first to point out that his occasional notions of marrying definitely ceased with the beginning of his real intimacy with Froude\".Oxford Apostles, p. 218 of the Pelican (1954) edition. However, while Faber's theory has had considerable popular influence, scholars of the Oxford Movement tend either to dismiss it entirely or to view it with great scepticism,Buckton (p. 36) cites Piers Brendon and Sheridan Gilley as scholars who dismiss Faber's theory. with even scholars specifically concerned with same-sex desire hesitating to endorse it.Buckton (p. 30) cautions: \"We ought, of course, to be wary of repeating [Charles] Kingsley's obsessive practice of eroticizing every aspect of Newman's life and faith.\"", "Ellis Hanson, for instance, writes that Newman and Froude clearly \"presented a challenge to Victorian gender norms\", but \"Faber's reading of Newman's sexlessnessFaber's book came out in 1933. Later research by Ker (see below) and others does not support the idea of Newman's \"sexlessness\". and Hurrell Froude's guiltAs Hilliard notes (p. 5), Piers Brendon, in his biography of Froude, offers a very different interpretation of Froude's sense of guilt. as evidence of homosexuality\" seems \"strained\".Ellis Hanson. Decadence and Catholicism. Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 254. When John Campbell Shairp combines masculine and feminine imagery in his highly poetic description of Newman's preaching style at Oxford in the early 1840s, Frederick S. Roden is put in mind of \"the late Victorian definition of a male invert, the homosexual: his (Newman's) homiletics suggest a woman's soul in a man's body\".Frederick S. Roden. Same-Sex Desire in Victorian Religious Culture. Palgrave MacMillan, 2003, p. 16. . In the passage cited by Roden, Shairp describes the style of Newman's sermons as \"so simple and transparent, yet so subtle withal; so strong yet so tender; the grasp of a strong man's hand, combined with the trembling of a woman's heart ... laying the most penetrating finger on the very core of things\". Roden, however, does not argue that Newman was homosexual, seeing him rather\u2014particularly in his professed celibacyRoden, pp. 4, 6, 13\u201314.\u2014as a \"cultural dissident\" or \"queer\". Roden uses the term \"queer\" in a very general sense \"to include any dissonant behaviours, discourses or claimed identities\" in relation to Victorian norms.Roden, p. 1. In this sense, \"Victorian Roman and Anglo-Catholicism were culturally queer\".Roden, p. 2. In Newman's case, Roden writes, \"homoaffectivity\" (found in heterosexuals and homosexuals alike)Roden, p. 1. Roden here explicitly follows Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, whose term \"homosociality\" he uses in the sense of \"homosociability or homoaffectivity\" (p. 7). \"is contained in friendships, in relationships that are not overtly sexual\".Roden, p. 7.", "* Rowlands, John Henry Lewis (1989).

In 1833 he moved from a tutorship at Oriel to become Principal of St Mary Hall and in 1834 he was appointed White's Professor of Moral Philosophy without any adverse comment in preference to Newman.
