The films were commercially successful but Williams claimed the cast were poorly paid. In his diaries, Williams wrote that he earned more in a St Ivel advert than for any Carry On film, although he was still earning the average Briton's annual salary in a month for the latter. He often privately criticised and \"dripped vitriol\" upon the films, considering them beneath him, even though he continued to appear in them. This became the case with many of the films and shows in which he appeared. He was quick to find fault with his own work, and also that of others. Despite this, he spoke fondly of the Carry Ons in interviews. Peter Rogers, producer of the series, recollected, \"Kenneth was worth taking care of because, while he cost very little\u2014\u00a35,000 a film, he made a great deal of money for the franchise.\"Kenneth Williams Unseen by Wes Butters and Russell Davies, HarperCollins 2008, p224", "In April 2008 Radio 4 broadcast the two-part The Pain of Laughter: The Last Days of Kenneth Williams.
