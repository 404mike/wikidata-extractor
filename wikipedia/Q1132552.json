In England, multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, \"the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving.\" Berge also mentions that this could be one of the reasons why the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries.

Pocock's dialectical call for both \"global\" contextualism as well as critical examination of the various \"multiculturalism\" iterations, and the subjective, if not potentially relative, contours of such contextualism.

Pocock had already candidly argued in a 1958 essay (published in 1962) that, despite paralleling an Oakeshottian commentary on the unavoidable influences of past society on human utterances, much of the burgeoning contextualist methodology derived from the teachings and efforts of Peter Laslett. In a recent response to an article on the history of the idea of the Cambridge School, Pocock was more bluntly political: \"...in Cambridge during these years [1956-58] I was greatly attracted, though never quite converted, to the aesthetic conservatism of Oakeshott\u2019s contention that the categories of discourse generated by a human society are...so numerous as to be incommensurable and their intimations for one another beyond analytic control.\" In a 1981 methodological essay, Pocock critiqued deconstruction, expressed \"surprise\" at pundits and scholars who \"denounced [him] as party to a conspiracy of American ideologues,\" and attempted to use Raiders of the Lost Ark character interpretations of the Ark of the Covenant to illustrate his approach to history. He thought it \"clear that I am not supposing a state of things in which each idiom or paradigm defines a community of persons who speak in its terms and whose thinking is governed by its presuppositions.\" The aims of reconstructing discourse were to illuminate political thought, not to foreclose the possibility or probability of political thought independent of a given discourse. In 2004, Pocock also confirmed that \"[Quentin] Skinner and I agree in a certain sympathy for the 'positive,' or as will appear, the 'republican' position.\" The latter \"position\" usually, but not always, signified modes of government rather than, for example, industrial and post-industrial North American \"progressive business\" or collectivism in stateless societies and subcultures.
