He studied under Martin of Tours before returning to his own land about 397. He established himself at Whithorn where he built a church of stone, \"Candida Casa\". Tradition holds that Ninian established an episcopal see at the Candida Casa in Whithorn, and named the see for Saint Martin of Tours. He converted the southern Picts to Christianity, and died around 432. Many Irish saints trained at the \"Candida Casa\", such as Tigernach of Clones, Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise, and Finnian of Movilla. Ninian's work was carried on by Palladius, who left Ireland to work among the Picts. The mission to the southern Picts apparently met with some setbacks, as Patrick charged Coroticus and the \"apostate Picts\" with conducting raids on the Irish coast and seizing Christians as slaves. Ternan and Saint Serf followed Palladius. Serf was the teacher of Saint Mungo, the apostle of Strathclyde, and patron saint of Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Lewis Grassic Gibbon", "response": ["The Grassic Gibbon Centre was established in Arbuthnott in 1991 to commemorate the author's life.
