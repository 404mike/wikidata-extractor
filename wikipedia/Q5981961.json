Dennis Waterman was cast after his performance in the Special Branch episode \"Stand and Deliver\", also produced by Euston Films. ", "From the very beginning, the Regan film was seen as having series potential. After it scored highly in the ratings, work began on the development of the series proper. Ian Kennedy Martin saw the subsequent series as being mainly studio-based, with more dialogue and less action, but producer Ted Childs, inspired in part by Get Carter (1971) and The French Connection (1971), disagreed. Following this battle for creative control, Ian Kennedy Martin parted company with the project. His shoes as series writer were filled by his brother Troy Kennedy Martin, Roger Marshall, Ranald Graham and Trevor Preston.

In the DVD commentary for \"Abduction\", it is claimed that Alison was written out because actress Stephanie Turner was asking for too much money to continue to appear in the series. Stephanie Turner went on to appear in Juliet Bravo, also devised and part-written by Ian Kennedy Martin.", "The first three books were written by Ian Kennedy Martin, the rest by Joe Balham.
