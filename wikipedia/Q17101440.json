By 1850 Bennett in particular had become recognised as \"perhaps the most distinguished among the landscape painters\" for his Cox-like vigorous and decisive style. Such early followers concentrated on the example of Cox's more moderate earlier work and steered clear of what were then seen as the excesses of Cox's later years. During a period dominated by sleek and detailed picturesque landscape, however, they were still condemned by publications such as The Spectator as \"the 'blottesque' school\", and failed to establish themselves as a cohesive movement."]}, {"page": "David Cox", "response": ["*David Cox Jr. (1809\u20131885), English landscapist"]}, {"page": "Hereford Cathedral School", "response": ["*David Cox Jr., painter"]}, {"page": "David Cox the younger", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Cox Jr."]}]}}
