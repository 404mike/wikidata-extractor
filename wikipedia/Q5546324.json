Alexander Pope was an early proponent of less formal gardens, calling in a 1713 article for gardens with the \"amiable simplicity of unadorned nature\". Other writers in the 18th century who encouraged less formal, and more natural, gardens included Joseph Addison and Lord Shaftesbury. The evolution of cottage gardens can be followed in the issues of The Cottage Gardener (1848\u201361), edited by George William Johnson, where the emphasis is squarely on the \"florist's flowers\", carnations and auriculas in fancy varieties that were originally cultivated as a highly competitive blue-collar hobby."]}, {"page": "George William Johnson", "response": ["George William Johnson may refer to:", "*George William Johnson (congressman) (1869\u20131944), lawyer and Democratic politician, United States Representative from West Virginia", "*George William Johnson (politician) (1892\u20131973), Canadian politician", "*George William Johnson (writer)"]}, {"page": "Sebright chicken", "response": ["Sebright set out to create a very small bantam chicken with laced plumage similar that of the laced Polish. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, it is thought that he created the gold Sebright by cross-breeding a buff Nankin bantam hen, a small gold-spangled Hamburgh-like hen and a small hen-feathered Pit Game cock; he later created the silver Sebright by crossing his golds with a white Rosecomb cock bought from the new Zoological Gardens of the Zoological Society of London, established in 1826. It is also possible that the hen-feathering characteristic derived from the Belgian Campine breed rather than from Pit Game. In about 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright Bantam Club, which was the first single-breed association for chickens.Graham p. 144 In 1853 the Sebright was described in the Poultry Book of William Wingfield and George William Johnson, with an illustration by Harrison Weir. It was included in the original Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry of William Bernhard Tegetmeier in 1865, and in the first Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874.

He was writing poetry by the mid-1820s, and set up a press by 1828. George William Johnson who lived in the village published his History of the Parish of Great Totham (1834) with Clark. Most of what he printed were parodies and songs, generally \"exceedingly silly and indecent\" according to Gordon Goodwin in the Dictionary of National Biography. Clark imitated the poet Thomas Hood, and in one case was threatened with legal action. That was caused by a poem of 1839, A Doctor's 'Do' ings, on the marriage of Dr Henry Dixon."]}]}}
