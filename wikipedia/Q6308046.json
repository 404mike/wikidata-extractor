Defending her position, Moore argued that \"he was a man who bought and sold women to other men\".

K. Rowling", "response": ["On 10 June 2020, Rowling published a 3,600-word essay on her website in response to the criticism. She again wrote that many women consider terms like \"people who menstruate\" to be demeaning. She said that she was a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault, and stated that \"When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman ... then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside\", while stating that most trans people were vulnerable and deserved protection. Rowling's essay was criticised by, among others, the children's charity Mermaids (which supports transgender and gender non-conforming children and their parents), Stonewall, GLAAD and the feminist gender theorist Judith Butler. Rowling has been referred to as a trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) on multiple occasions, though she rejects the label. Rowling has received support from actors Robbie Coltrane and Eddie Izzard, and some feminists such as activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali and the radical feminist Julie Bindel.

She further argued that \"modern proponents of polyamory tend to ignore gender-dynamics\" and called polyamory the choice of \"overwhelmingly white, affluent, university-educated, and privileged folk\" who have too much time on their hands."]}, {"page": "Radical feminism", "response": ["Radical lesbians are distinguished from other radical feminists through their ideological roots in political lesbianism.

Radical feminists in particular who exclude trans women are often referred to as \"trans-exclusionary radical feminists\" or \"TERFs\", an acronym to which they object, say is inaccurate (citing, for example, their inclusion of trans men as women), and argue is a slur or even hate speech. These feminists argue that because trans women are assigned male at birth, they are accorded corresponding privileges in society, and even if they choose to present as women, the fact that they have a choice in this sets them apart from people assigned female. Gender-critical or trans-exclusionary radical feminists in particular say that the difference in behavior between men and women is the result of socialization.

Clover further argues that the film's sympathies are entirely with Jennifer, that the male audience is meant to identify with her and not with the attackers, and that the point of the film is a masochistic identification with pain used to justify the bloody catharsis of revenge.
