He went to School in Lewes and then on to a degree in Psychology at the University of Liverpool in 1974 where he was exposed to the radical politics of the city, became (briefly) interested in alternative therapies, and responded to the traditional British empirical psychology that was the mainstay of the Liverpool psychology degree programme at the time.  He read the work of John Shotter, Kenneth Gergen and Rom Harr\u00e9 and became excited by the so-called crisis in social psychology.  This critical work led him to a master's degree in philosophy of science at the University of Surrey where he worked on speech act theory and had a first exposure to post structuralism and in particular the work of Roland Barthes.  He read and wrote about Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend and Imre Lakatos.  At the same time, philosophy of science provided a pathway to the new sociology of scientific knowledge and in particular to the work of Harry Collins, Michael Mulkay and Steve Woolgar."]}, {"page": "John Potter", "response": ["*Jonathan Potter (born 1956), British professor and originator of discursive psychology", "*Jonathan Potter (cricketer) (born 1971), English cricketer ", "*Jonathan Potter (computer programmer), Australian programmer"]}, {"page": "Potter (name)", "response": ["**Jonathan Potter (born 1956), British professor and originator of discursive psychology", "**Jonathan Potter (cricketer) (born 1971), English cricketer ", "**Jonathan Potter (computer programmer), Australian programmer"]}]}}
