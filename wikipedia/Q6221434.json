He was one of the colonizers of the Yukon River. Bell was appreciated by the company for his \"professionalism, flexibility and dedication to the interests of the fur trade\" as well as his abilities as a \"manager of men\".In 1839, he was sent to colonize the land west of the Mackenzie River. With the assistance of Alexander Kennedy Isbister, he established Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories on the Peel River not far from the Mackenzie, and colonized the Peel into what is now the Yukon Territory.\nIn 1845, Bell crossed the mountains into the Yukon River watershed, and went down the Rat River to its confluence with the Porcupine River. The Rat River has been renamed the Bell River in his honour. After managing the fur trade at Fort McPherson until 1845, he returned to the Bell River, and Followed the Porcupine to its juncture with the Yukon River, the eventual site of Fort Yukon. He set the stage for the Yukon trade which proved extremely lucrative for the Hudson's Bay Company and for Canada's claim over what is now the Yukon Territory.\nHe had some involvement in organizing John Rae's 1848\u20131849 expedition to search for Sir John Franklin, and continued working in the Mackenzie District for the Hudson's Bay Company until 1860. Although his exploits as an explorer are most often publicized, Bell preferred to work as a manager and organizer. He accepted the exploring jobs as required but did so \"without the enthusiasm and sense of destiny that inspired other HBC explorers. He was, in fact, a fur trader rather than an explorer, both in talent and temperament.\"Bell completed his career in Quebec, retiring from the company in 1860. He then moved to Saugeen, Ontario and farmed in the area until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yukon", "response": ["The territory is named after the Yukon River, the longest river in the Yukon.

White water river in fact corresponds to Gwich\u02bcin words that can be shortened to form Yukon.  Because the Holikachuks had been trading regularly with both the Gwich\u02bcins and the Yup'iks,Lt. Zagoskin reported that: \"The ... Inkilit [Holikachuk] ... live along the routes of communication between the Yukon and the coast and are occupied almost exclusively with buying up furs from the natives living along the Yunnaka (Koyukuk River, a Yukon tributary).\"  Zagoskin also reported that: \"The Inkalik [Holikachuk] ..., who are chiefly occupied in trading both with their fellow tribesmen and with the neighboring tribes of Kang-ulit (Yup'ik), have adopted the way of life of the latter ...\"  , at pp. 196-97, 244.  Because they had adopted the Yup'ik (Eskimo) way of life, and because they were the ones trading upriver, the Holikachuk would have been \"the Esquimaux\" referred to in John Bell's 1845 report: \"The Esquimaux to the westwards likewise ascends the 'Youcon' and carry on a trade with the natives, as well as with the Musquash [Gwich\u02bcin] Indians ... I have seen a large camp of the latter tribe on the Rat River on my return, who, had about a doz: of beat [hammered] Iron Kettles of Russian Manufacture which they bartered from the Esquimaux.\"  See, Hudson's Bay Company Correspondence to Simpson from Bell (1845), HBC Archives, D.5/14, fos. 212, 213.  For these reasons, the Holikachuk were in a position to conflate the meanings of the Gwich\u02bcin and Yup'ik names, and to furnish this conflated information to the Russian-American Company. the Holikachuks were in a position to borrow the Gwich\u02bcin contraction and to conflate its meaning with the meaning of Kuigpak [River-big], which is the Yup'ik name for the same river.  For that reason, the documentary evidence suggests that the Holikachuks had borrowed the contraction \u0172\u0173g Han [White Water River] from Gwich\u02bcin, and erroneously assumed that this contraction had the same literal meaning as the corresponding Yup'ik name Kuigpak [River-big]."]}]}}
