Calverley had been hired by the Egypt Exploration Society in 1927 to copy the wall scenes in the Temple of Seti I, c. 1300 BC at Abydos. In the winter of 1928, a visit to Abydos by Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr. changed the scope of the work being done.  Rockefeller was so impressed with the painted reliefs and Calverley's photography like reproductions, that he decided to finance the entire project.  As a patron of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, he was also responsible for the Oriental Institute joining efforts on the temple endeavor with the Egypt Exploration Society."]}, {"page": "Winifred Needler", "response": ["Needler was able to do field work only intermittently. She spent the summers of 1941 and 1942 in field work at the old mission in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Then in 1947 she had her first chance to do field work in Egypt, joining a team at the temple of Seti I at Abydos, where she worked alongside Amice Calverley to copy wall paintings and inscriptions. In 1956, she spent a month at Jericho, where Kathleen Kenyon was leading the excavations, drawing and recording newfound objects. In 1962\u201363 she spent time working with Walter Bryan Emery at Buhen in the Sudan and at Qasr Ibrim in Egypt, where archeological salvage work was under way in advance of the construction of Aswan Dam. Needler worked on excavating a cemetery,  dismantling a temple built by Queen Hatshepsut, and making drawings of artifacts removed from the sites."]}, {"page": "Temple of Seti I (Abydos)", "response": ["The temple was described by pioneer archaeologist Flinders Petrie. The temple was documented in 1933 in a four-volume series entitled The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos. The books were largely devoted to the exceptional copies of the temple's wall paintings done by Ms. Amice Calverley."]}]}}
