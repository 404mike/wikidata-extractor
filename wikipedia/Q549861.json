He was a spokesman for science, as well as a teacher and author.\nZiman was born in Cambridge, England, in 1925. His parents were Solomon Netheim Ziman and, Nellie Frances, n\u00e9e Gaster. The family emigrated to New Zealand when Ziman was a baby. He obtained his early education at Hamilton High School and the Victoria University College. He obtained his PhD from Balliol College, Oxford and did his early research on the theory of electrons in liquid metals at the University of Cambridge.In 1964 he was appointed professor of theoretical physics at University of Bristol, where he wrote his Elements Of Advanced Quantum Theory (1969) which explains the rudiments of quantum field theory with an elementary condensed matter slant. During this period, his interests shifted towards the philosophy of science. He argued about the social dimension of science, and the social responsibility of scientists in numerous essays and books.He married twice, to Rosemary Dixon in 1951 and secondly to Joan Solomon, and was survived by her and three of his four children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Science", "response": ["John Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge. Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as \"perceptual consensibility.\" He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge."]}, {"page": "List of theoretical physicists", "response": ["* John Ziman (1925\u20132005)"]}, {"page": "2005 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 2 January \u2013 John Ziman, physicist and humanist"]}, {"page": "1925 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 16 May \u2013 John Ziman, physicist, humanist"]}, {"page": "Knowledge production modes", "response": ["Gibbons and colleagues argued that a new form of knowledge production began emerging in the mid-20th century that was context-driven, problem-focused and interdisciplinary. It involved multidisciplinary teams that worked together for short periods of time on specific problems in the real world. Gibbons and his colleagues labelled this \"Mode 2\" knowledge production. He and his colleagues distinguished this from traditional research, labelled 'Mode 1', which is academic, investigator-initiated and discipline-based knowledge production. In support, Limoges  wrote, \"We now speak of 'context-driven' research, meaning 'research carried out in a context of application, arising from the very work of problem solving and not governed by the paradigms of traditional disciplines of knowledge.\" John Ziman drew a similar distinction between academic science and post-academic science, and in 2001 Helga Nowotny, Peter Scott and Michael Gibbons extended their analysis to the implications of Mode 2 knowledge production for society."]}, {"page": "Henry H.

This reputation started with its encouragement in the late 1980s of independent debate on research which purported to show the decline in UK science, and continued with John Ziman's exploration of the bounds of government support of science and the risks of excessive accountability which he later developed into the book Prometheus Bound: science in a dynamic steady state (Cambridge University Press, 1994) and with research which some considered gave undue emphasis to social and economic perspectives on science and technology.
