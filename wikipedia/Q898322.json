These theories typically involve the \"Fieschi Letter\", sent to Edward\u00a0III by an Italian priest called Manuel Fieschi, who claimed that Edward escaped Berkeley Castle in 1327 with the help of a servant and ultimately retired to become a hermit in the Holy Roman Empire. The body buried at Gloucester Cathedral was said to be that of the porter of Berkeley Castle, killed by the assassins and presented by them to Isabella as Edward's corpse to avoid punishment. The letter is often linked to an account of Edward\u00a0III meeting with a man called William the Welshman in Antwerp in 1338, who claimed to be Edward\u00a0II. Some parts of the letter's content are considered broadly accurate by historians, although other aspects of its account have been criticised as implausible.;  A few historians have supported versions of its narrative. Paul C. Doherty questions the veracity of the letter and the identity of William the Welshman, but nonetheless has suspicions that Edward may have survived his imprisonment. The popular historian Alison Weir believes the events in the letter to be essentially true, using the letter to argue that Isabella was innocent of murdering Edward. The historian Ian Mortimer suggests that the story in Fieschi's letter is broadly accurate, but argues that it was in fact Mortimer and Isabella who had Edward secretly released, and who then faked his death, a fiction later maintained by Edward\u00a0III when he came to power.;  Ian Mortimer's account was criticised by most scholars when it was first published, in particular by historian David Carpenter.; "]}, {"page": "Anna Apostolou", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul C.

Doherty suggests that the pilgrimage was a ruse on the part of the King and Queen to create a casus belli.  Edward would have known beforehand that Baron Badlesmere was with the Contrariants in Oxford and had left Leeds Castle in the hands of the belligerently hostile Baroness Badlesmere; therefore he had given instructions for Isabella to deliberately stop at Leeds aware she would likely be refused admittance. Using the insult against the Queen as a banner, he would then be able to gather the moderate nobles and outraged populace to his side as a means of crushing the Contrariants.Doherty, Paul C. (2003).

This poisonous plant can produce prolonged poisoning symptoms that match the course of events as described in the Alexander Romance, and was known to the Ancient Greeks. The article was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Clinical Toxicology and suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause. This theory is backed by the writings of the Ancient Greek historian Diodorus, who had recorded Alexander becoming \"stricken with pain after drinking a large bowl of wine.\""]}, {"page": "Grace (surname)", "response": ["*C.
