Hoy says the BMX bike he saw in the film is what inspired him to start cycling. Before track cycling, Hoy raced BMX between the ages of 7 and 14 and was ranked second in Britain, fifth in Europe, and ninth in the world. He received sponsorship from Slazenger and Kwik-Fit, and was competing in Europe and the U.S. He first became aware of track cycling when he watched TV coverage of Scottish sprinter Eddie Alexander winning a bronze medal at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Hoy also represented the Scotland Junior Rowing Team and was second in the 1993 National Rowing Championships with Grant Florence in the coxless pairs. He played rugby as part of his school's team."]}, {"page": "British National Tandem Sprint Championships", "response": ["| 1985 || Michael Borman  Chris Pyatt      ||  Karl McHugh  Paul McHugh || Eddie AlexanderSteve Paulding ", "| 1987 || Eddie AlexanderStewart Brydon ||Michael Borman  Chris Pyatt ||Dave Marsh  Brian Fudge", "| 1988|| Eddie AlexanderStewart Brydon || Michael Borman  Chris Pyatt||Michael Garratt  Gary Hibbert", "| 1990 || Peter Boyd  Gary Hibbert ||  Chris Pyatt  Martin Phillips  || Eddie AlexanderChris Ransome"]}, {"page": "City of Edinburgh Racing Club", "response": ["| Eddie Alexander || 1988 4th Sprint || 1986 Sprint   1987 Sprint|| 1986 3rd 15px Sprint"]}, {"page": "Achievements of members of City of Edinburgh Racing Club", "response": ["*1986 \u2013 15px Sprint Eddie Alexander ", "**15px 1 km Time Trial \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px 1 km Time Trial \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px Sprint \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px Tandem Sprint \u2013 Eddie Alexander and Steve Paulding", "**15px Sprint \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px 1 km Time Trial \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px Tandem Sprint \u2013 Stewart Brydon and Eddie Alexander", "**15px Sprint \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px Tandem Sprint \u2013 Stewart Brydon and Eddie Alexander", "**15px 1 km Time Trial \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px Sprint \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px 1 km Time Trial \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px Tandem Sprint \u2013 Eddie Alexander", "**15px Sprint \u2013 Eddie Alexander"]}, {"page": "Alexander, Eddie", "response": ["#redirectEddie Alexander"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's sprint", "response": ["| 8 ||align=left| Eddie Alexander ||align=left|  ||10.930 || ", "| 1 ||align=left| Eddie Alexander ||align=left|  || 11.40 || ", "| 2 ||align=left| Eddie Alexander ||align=left|  || || ", "| 1 ||align=left| Eddie Alexander ||align=left|  || 11.32 || ", "| 1 ||align=left| Eddie Alexander ||align=left|  || || 11.81 || 10.79 || ", "| 2 ||align=left| Eddie Alexander ||align=left|  || || ||  || ", "| 4 ||align=left| Eddie Alexander ||align=left|  || || || "]}, {"page": "British National Individual Sprint Championships", "response": ["| 1983 Am||Leicester Velodrome   || Mark Barry  || Paul Sydenham   || Eddie Alexander or Paul Swinnerton ", "| 1985 Am ||Leicester Velodrome ||  Paul McHugh  ||  Eddie Alexander || Mark Barry", "| 1987 Am ||Leicester Velodrome|| Eddie Alexander|| Paul McHugh ||  Stewart Brydon ", "| 1988 Am ||Leicester Velodrome|| Eddie Alexander ||  Stewart Brydon  ||Paul McHugh   ", "| 1989 Am ||Leicester Velodrome|| Stewart Brydon || Eddie Alexander                 ||Steve Paulding", "| 1991 Am||Leicester Velodrome || Stewart Brydon || Eddie Alexander   || Steve Paulding"]}, {"page": "British National Individual Time Trial Championships", "response": ["| 1984 || Shaun Wallace  ||  Mark Barry  ||Eddie Alexander", "| 1985  || Eddie Alexander ||                     ||", "|1987 || Eddie Alexander   ||| Colin Sturgess      || Steve Paulding", "| 1988 ||  Gary Neiwand (Aus) || Eddie Alexander ||Paul McHugh", "| 1990 || Steve Paulding ||    Adrian Hawkins || Eddie Alexander  "]}, {"page": "1989 British National Track Championships", "response": ["| Eddie Alexander"]}, {"page": "1991 British National Track Championships", "response": ["| Eddie Alexander         "]}, {"page": "1990 British National Track Championships", "response": ["| Eddie Alexander                     ", "| Eddie AlexanderChris Ransome"]}, {"page": "Stewart Brydon", "response": ["Stewart Brydon (born 1967) is a Scottish male former racing cyclist, a multiple British national champion on the track in the sprint (British Track Sprint champion six times consecutively ), twice tandem champion with Eddie Alexander and a winner of the Keirin and team sprint titles.
