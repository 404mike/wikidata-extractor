In 1890, Wales hosted Ireland at the Old Racecourse in the English border town of Shrewsbury. The Football Association of Wales (FAW), the country's governing body for the sport, believed that holding the match at the Old Racecourse would attract a larger crowd. Although the match drew a significant number of fans, its attendance of 5,000 was only equal to that at previous fixtures at the Racecourse Ground. Matches returned to Wrexham until 1892, when Wales's opening fixture of the 1891\u201392 British Home Championship against Ireland was moved to Penrhyn Park in Bangor; the FAW had been petitioned by the committee of the town's football club, Bangor, to host a match. The venue, provided by George Douglas-Pennant, 2nd Baron Penrhyn (who was present at the match), was on the grounds of Penrhyn Estate. Inexperienced security personnel were unable to manage a crush which developed in the waiting crowd, resulting in at least one serious injury when a boy suffered broken ribs. The crush forced stewards to open the gates to the ground and allow most of the spectators in without paying, losing the FAW significant gate revenue. The North Wales Express called the decision to admit all 5,000\u20136,000 spectators through a single small gate \"sheer stupidity\"."]}, {"page": "Garth Pier", "response": ["Opened to the public on 14 May 1896, the ceremony performed by George Douglas-Pennant, 2nd Baron Penrhyn.
