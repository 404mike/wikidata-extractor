The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Agazarian was a wireless operator with the Prosper network based in Paris.\nAgazarian was captured by the Germans on 30 July 1943 when he showed up for a scheduled meeting with a fellow agent. The Germans had captured the other agent and were trying to lure the deputy leader of SOE's French Section, Nicolas Bodington, to the meeting, but Agazarian attended instead. He was later executed. Agazarian's wife Francine was also a SOE agent.", "link_mentions": {}}}
