The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Agazarian was a wireless operator with the Prosper network based in Paris.\nAgazarian was captured by the Germans on 30 July 1943 when he showed up for a scheduled meeting with a fellow agent. The Germans had captured the other agent and were trying to lure the deputy leader of SOE's French Section, Nicolas Bodington, to the meeting, but Agazarian attended instead. He was later executed. Agazarian's wife Francine was also a SOE agent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people who were executed", "response": ["* Jack Agazarian (d. 1945)"]}, {"page": "Henri D\u00e9ricourt", "response": ["D\u00e9ricourt soon assembled his Farrier team, consisting of Aisner as his courier and another old friend, pilot R\u00e9my Cl\u00e9ment, as an assistant. He relied on the Prosper network led by Francis Suttill for a radio operator, Jack Agazarian. Andr\u00e9e Borrel helped Aisner with the courier duties. Through courier Lise de Baissac, D\u00e9ricourt also established links with the large SOE Scientist network on the Atlantic Ocean coast of France, which also needed his services to move agents.Marshall, p. 111  These extensive links among networks, although understandable as D\u00e9ricourt serviced several networks, violated SOE's doctrine that for security reasons networks should be independent of each other with as little contact as possible between and among networks and even among members of the same network.Foot, p. 104, 289, 309-311.", "The first known criticism by SOE agents of D\u00e9ricourt was in June 1943 when Jack Agazarian complained to London that D\u00e9ricourt's security was faulty.

In summer 1943, the Prosper network was destroyed by the Germans. Suttill, Norman and many other members and associates of the Prosper network were captured.
