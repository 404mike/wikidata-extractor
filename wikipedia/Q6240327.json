His main contribution to medicine has been the first description of leukemia as a blood disorder (1845). The first person to describe leukemia as an unknown disease was Alfred Fran\u00e7ois Donn\u00e9.\nBennett was the first doctor to describe aspergillosis. In his seminal paper published in 1842 entitled \"On the parasitic vegetable structures found growing in living animals\" he makes the very first description of aspergillus (a pathogenic fungus) growing in the lung tissue of humans.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeline of medicine and medical technology", "response": ["* 1845 \u2013 John Hughes Bennett first describes leukemia as a blood disorder."]}, {"page": "Bloodletting", "response": ["Bloodletting gradually declined in popularity over the course of the 19th century, becoming rather uncommon in most places, before its validity was thoroughly debated. In the medical community of Edinburgh, bloodletting was abandoned in practice before it was challenged in theory, a contradiction highlighted by physician-physiologist John Hughes Bennett. Authorities such as Austin Flint I, Hiram Corson, and William Osler became prominent supporters of bloodletting in the 1880s and onwards, disputing Bennett's premise that bloodletting had fallen into disuse because it did not work. These advocates framed bloodletting as an orthodox medical practice, to be used in spite of its general unpopularity. Some physicians considered bloodletting useful for a more limited range of purposes, such as to \"clear out\" infected or weakened blood or its ability to \"cause h\u00e6morrhages to cease\"\u2014as evidenced in a call for a \"fair trial for blood-letting as a remedy\" in 1871."]}, {"page": "Rudolf Virchow", "response": ["In 1845, Virchow and John Hughes Bennett independently observed abnormal increases in white blood cells in some patients.

As was common he the time he did not graduate. Moving to Edinburgh he attended the anatomy lectures of John Struthers at the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine which convinced him to study medicine.  As a medical student at the University of Edinburgh his teachers included what he later described as 'a galaxy of genius and talent\u2019. These included James Syme (surgery), John Hughes Bennett (physiology), James Young Simpson (Midwifery) and John Goodsir (Anatomy). Pettigrew flourished under the tutelage of John Goodsir with whom he developed a programme of research into the morphology of the human heart. During this project he prepared 112 dissections of cardiac muscle recording these by meticulous drawings and photographs. For this work he was awarded the anatomy gold medal.  The London physiologist William Sharpey and  Allen Thomson were so impressed with this work that they invited Pettigrew to deliver the Croonian Lectures of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1860.This was a rare distinction for an undergraduate. In these lectures, Pettigrew advanced a remarkable discussion of the anatomical arrangement of the musculature of the heart. In 1861 he graduated MD from Edinburgh with the Gold Medal for his year and became House Surgeon to James Syme at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. From an early age, Pettigrew demonstrated a remarkable flair for morphological analysis and an analytical grasp of natural history."]}, {"page": "Douglas Argyll Robertson", "response": ["After graduating MD in 1857 from the University of St Andrews, he was appointed house surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh before going to Prague to study ophthalmology under Carl Ferdinand von Arlt (1812-1887) and then to Berlin to study under Albrecht von Graefe (1828\u20131870).Ravin JG.
