A grandson of the Canadian reform leader Robert Baldwin, and son of John Ross and Augusta Elizabeth Baldwin, Ross was a pivotal figure on the London literary and artistic scene from the mid-1890s to his early death, and mentored several literary figures, including Siegfried Sassoon. His open homosexuality, in a period when male homosexual acts were illegal, brought him many hardships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 25", "response": ["*1869 \u2013 Robbie Ross, Canadian journalist and art critic (d. 1918)"]}, {"page": "Oscar Wilde", "response": ["Wilde's friends had advised him against the prosecution at a Saturday Review meeting at the Caf\u00e9 Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that \"they are going to prove sodomy against you\" and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying \"it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends\". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome a day or so before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome pp 151\u2013152 (1976, Jonathan Cape, London) The Life of Arthur Ransome by Hugh Brogan p85 (1984, Jonathan Cape, London) ", "After Wilde left the court, a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Via  Pont Street, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner; both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover and try to get a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, \"The train has gone. It's too late.\" On 6 April 1895, Wilde was arrested for \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning homosexual acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute).See Offences Against the Person Act 1861, ss 61, 62 At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway, where he received daily visits from Douglas.", "By 25 November 1900 Wilde had developed meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\". Robbie Ross arrived on 29 November, sent for a priest, and Wilde was conditionally baptised into the Catholic Church by Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin,Cavill, Paul, Heather Ward, Matthew Baynham, and Andrew Swinford, The Christian tradition in English literature: poetry, plays, and shorter prose , p.\u00a0337, Zondervan 2007.

The relationship clearly had a profound impact on Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\". Sassoon wrote that he took \"an instinctive liking to him\",Sassoon, Siegfried: \"Siegfried's Journey\" p. 58, Faber and Faber, first published in 1946. and recalled their time together \"with affection\".Sassoon, Siegfried: \"Siegfried's Journey\", p. 61, Faber and Faber, 1946. On the evening of 3 November 1917 they parted, Owen having been discharged from Craiglockhart. He was stationed on home-duty in Scarborough for several months, during which time he associated with members of the artistic circle into which Sassoon had introduced him, which included Robbie Ross and Robert Graves. He also met H. G.\u00a0Wells and Arnold Bennett, and it was during this period he developed the stylistic voice for which he is now recognised. Many of his early poems were penned while stationed at the Clarence Garden Hotel, now the Clifton Hotel in Scarborough's North Bay. A blue tourist plaque on the hotel marks its association with Owen.", "Robert GravesGraves, Robert, Goodbye To All That: An Autobiography, NY, 1929 (\"Owen was an idealistic homosexual\"); 1st edn only: quote subsequently excised.

Through Sassoon, Owen was introduced to a sophisticated homosexual literary circle which included Oscar Wilde's friend Robbie Ross, writer and poet Osbert Sitwell, and Scottish writer C. K. Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Marcel Proust. This contact broadened Owen's outlook, and increased his confidence in incorporating homoerotic elements into his work.Hibberd, ibid. pp. 337, 375.Hoare, Philip. Oscar Wilde's Last Stand: decadence, conspiracy, and the most outrageous trial of the century(Arcade Publishing, 1998), , p. 24. Historians have debated whether Owen had an affair with Scott Moncrieff in May 1918; he had dedicated various works to a \"Mr\u00a0W.O.\",Hibberd, p. 155. but Owen never responded."]}, {"page": "Lord Alfred Douglas", "response": ["Douglas had praised Wilde's play Salome in the Oxford magazine, The Spirit Lamp, of which he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining acceptance for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written Salom\u00e9 in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between both of them, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher John Lane and the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley when they themselves objected to the poor standard of Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to Robbie Ross: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but in a gesture of reconciliation suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title page. Accepting this, Douglas, vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title page as \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".", "In response to the card and with Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as Robbie Ross, Frank Harris and George Bernard Shaw, Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal libel in a private prosecution, as sodomy was then a criminal offence. According to the libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge public. Edward Carson, Queensberry's lawyer, accordingly portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced as evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was questioned closely on the homoerotic themes in The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Chameleon, a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed  \"Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young\".", "While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter entitled De Profundis, describing exactly how he felt about him. Wilde was not permitted to send it, but it may or may not have been sent to him after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross with instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotations and didn't know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde's on which Ross had consulted. After Wilde's release on 19 May 1897, the two reunited in August at Rouen, but stayed together only a few months due to personal differences and various pressures on them.", "The cohabitation period in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually gained funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he gave him occasional sum. Wilde was still bankrupt when he died in 1900. Douglas served as chief mourner, but there was reportedly a graveside altercation between him and Robbie Ross that developed into a feud and foreshadowed the later litigation between the two former lovers of Wilde.", "Douglas also contributed to Billing's journal Vigilante as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem calling Margot Asquith one \"bound with Lesbian fillets\", while her husband Prime Minister Herbert gave Ross money.Philip Hoare. (1999). Oscar Wilde's Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century. Arcade Publishing, p. 110. During the trial he called Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\", adding that he intensely regretted having met Wilde and helped him with the French translation of Salome, which he called \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\"."]}, {"page": "Arthur Ransome", "response": ["Ransome began writing books of biography and literary criticism on various authors; one on Edgar Allan Poe was published in 1910 and another on Oscar Wilde in 1912. However, the latter embroiled him in a libel suit with Lord Alfred Douglas. His wife attended the 1913 trial, sitting in the public gallery as Ransome would not let her sit beside him. Her apparent enjoyment of the public notoriety the case attracted added to the stress on their marriage. The publisher Daniel Macmillan dined with the couple every day during the trial so that Ivy could not quarrel with Arthur.Brogan (1984), p 90 Ransome won the suit, supported by Robbie Ross, the editor of De Profundis. Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77 Ransome did, however, remove the offending passages from the second edition of his bookRansome, Arthur, Oscar Wilde \u2013 A Critical Study, 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913 and refused all interviews, despite the obvious publicity value."]}, {"page": "1918 in literature", "response": ["*October 3 \u2013 Siegfried Sassoon visits his mentor Robbie Ross for the last time.

In addition, Sheen made his film debut that year, appearing opposite Kenneth Branagh in Othello. 1996 saw Sheen at the National Theatre for The Ends of the Earth, an original play by David Lan. A minor role in Mary Reilly marked the first of three film collaborations with director Stephen Frears. Sheen's most significant appearance of 1997 was the title role in Henry V, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at their Stratford-upon-Avon theatre, which earned him a second Ian Charleson Award nomination. The Times praised \"a blisteringly intelligent performance\". Also in 1997, he appeared in a revival of Harold Pinter's The Homecoming at the National Theatre, directed by Roger Michell, and directed Badfinger, starring Rhys Ifans, at the Donmar Warehouse. The latter was staged by the Thin Language Theatre Company, which Sheen had co-founded in 1991, aiming to further Welsh theatre. He then appeared in the biographical film Wilde, playing Robbie Ross to Stephen Fry's Oscar Wilde.
