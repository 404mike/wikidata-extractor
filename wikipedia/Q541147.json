In April 1930, he advanced to play the lead in the school's major production, of The New Poor, a 1924 comedy by Cosmo Hamilton. In due course, Ray led the Buskins, and started dressing the role of an early twentieth-century aesthete.  As well, he started to offer more left-leaning political commentary in the college paper.  He fostered other proclivities that would persist through most of his life.  After he and Kay Snodgrass broke up, and she transferred to the university in Madison, he courted numerous young women, and balanced insomnia with alcohol-fed socializing all night long.McGilligan, 15\u201320."]}, {"page": "Gielgud Theatre", "response": ["The first play at the theatre was a musical called The Beauty of Bath by Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton.
