He played in the 2001 Benson & Hedges Cup final taking one wicket. He was a regular player for his home county until 2008 when he joined Essex for whom he played Twenty20 cricket in 2009.\nIn 2010, Hardinges was selected as one of 21 players to form the first Unicorns squad to take part in the Clydesdale Bank 40 domestic one day competition against the regular first-class counties.
