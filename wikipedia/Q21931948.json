The county club has its origin in the Kent Club founded at Canterbury on 6 August 1842. A similar organisation was formed at Maidstone in 1859 and, in 1870, these two amalgamated to create the present county club. Like the Kent county teams formed by earlier organisations, including the old Town Malling club, the county club has always been classified as a top-class team. The players listed have played for the club in first-class cricket, List A cricket or Twenty20 cricket matches.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Kent player and then his name is given as it would usually appear on modern match scorecards. Note that many players represented other teams besides Kent. Current players are shown as active to the latest year in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team. Players who represented the county before August 1842 are included only if they also played for the county club after its initial formation.\n\nAs of 17 July 2021", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William James (disambiguation)", "response": ["William James (1842\u20131910) was an American psychologist and philosopher.", "William James may also refer to:", "* William James (Royal Navy admiral) (1881\u20131974), British admiral", "* William James (Australian general) (1930\u20132015), Australian Army general", "* Sir William James, 1st Baronet (1721\u20131783), East India Company navy commander and director, Member of Parliament for West Looe 1774\u20131783", "* William James (Carlisle MP) (1791\u20131861), Member of Parliament for Carlisle 1820\u20131826", "* William James (MP for Kent), Member of Parliament for Kent, 1654\u201359", "* William James (cricketer) (1858\u2013?), English cricketer", "* William James (rugby league), rugby league footballer in the 1920s and 1930s", "* William James (bowls) (born 1969), Swaziland lawn bowler", "* William James (American football) (born 1979), American footballer", "* Knucks James (William James, 1878\u20131966), American baseball player", "* William James (bishop) (1542\u20131617), English academic and bishop of Durham, 1606\u201317", "* William James (slave trader) (1735\u20131798), operating out of the Port of Liverpool", "* William James (railway promoter) (1771\u20131837), British", "* William James (naval historian) (1780\u20131827), British naval historian during the Age of Sail", "* William James (engineer) (1854\u20131889), British engineer", "* William James (photographer) (1866\u20131948), British-Canadian photographer"]}]}}
