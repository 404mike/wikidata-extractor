After five years on snooker's secondary tour, James finally made it to the Main tour for the 2005\u201306 snooker season. McBain finished third in the Pontin's International Open Series Order of Merit, winning the last of eight events to clinch his promotion to the main tour again for the 2007\u201308 season, but was relegated in 2009. In 2010 he won the play-off match, which determined who will qualify for the 2010/2011 professional Main Tour. In 2010/2011 he had notable wins against Stuart Bingham, Anthony Hamilton, Mark Allen and Gerard Greene, but just fell short of retaining his Tour place, finishing 75th in the rankings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of snooker players", "response": ["*James McBain"]}, {"page": "Anthony Hamilton (snooker player)", "response": ["In 2010/2011 season Hamilton failed to qualify for the first three ranking events as he lost 2\u20135 against Ricky Walden at the Shanghai Masters, 1\u20133 against James McBain at the World Open and 3\u20139 against Rod Lawler at the UK Championship.
