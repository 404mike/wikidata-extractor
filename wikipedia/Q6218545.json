He attended St Matthew's Catholic Primary School, before later enrolling at  St Mary's, in Crosby. When he was six years old, local football club Liverpool hosted a half-term  camp to which a number of pupils from his school were invited, and his was one of the names drawn from a hat to attend. There, he was spotted by academy coach Ian Barrigan who subsequently approached his parents to offer him the chance to join the club's academy. He began training two-to-three times a week, and in a variety of different positions, before later going on to captain the club at U16 and U18 level under coach Pepijn Lijnders. In the intervening period, at the age of 14, he left St. Mary's to enroll at Rainhill High School, an educational institution which shares an affiliation with the football club.", "Alexander-Arnold is the nephew of former Reading and Millwall footballer, and former Manchester United club secretary, John Alexander. His maternal grandmother, Doreen Carling, was once also in a relationship with former United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, before moving to New York City where she later married.

He has two brothers; Tyler, who is four years his senior and acts as his agent, and Marcel, who is three years younger."]}, {"page": "List of English association football families", "response": ["* John Alexander, Trent Alexander-Arnold (nephew)"]}]}}
