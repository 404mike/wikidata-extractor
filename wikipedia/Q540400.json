Webster played at right back. Webster was always a fans' favourite because of his hard tackles and effort. Seth Johnson, a recent ex-Derby player was compared to him for his hard working attitude on the pitch. He is rated by many people as being one of the most loyal Derby County players ever for his services and contribution to the club.\nHe played 455 league games for Derby, which is the second highest in Derby County's history, (only Kevin Hector played more), from 1960\u20131978, scoring 7 times. Ron was part of the Brian Clough and Peter Taylor era at Derby, and then the just as successful Dave Mackay era. Webster was an integral part of a near unbeatable defence. Webster retired in 1977 after his last game (a 1\u20131 draw with Chelsea). Webster stayed on at Derby as coach, but is now retired.\nOn 30 March 2009, he was voted the greatest right back in Derby County history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Clough", "response": ["In Clough's first season, the club finished one place lower than in the previous season, but he had started to lay the foundations for his future success by signing several new players, among them Roy McFarland, John O'Hare, John McGovern, Alan Hinton and Les Green. Of the inherited squad, 11 players departed and only four were retained: Kevin Hector, Alan Durban, Ron Webster and Colin Boulton. Clough also sacked the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a Derby defeat. With the additional signings of Dave Mackay and Willie Carlin in 1968, Clough and Taylor's management led Derby to become champions of Division Two, establishing the club record of 22 matches without defeat on the way."]}, {"page": "Belper", "response": ["*Ron Webster, professional footballer, born in Belper in 1943.
