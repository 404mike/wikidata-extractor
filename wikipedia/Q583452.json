He was the winner of the 3,200-meter steeplechase at the 1908 Summer Olympics for Great Britain.Russell, from Staffordshire, won the British AAA Championships in steeplechase from 1904 to 1906. He won his first AAA title while only 17 years old.\nAt the London Olympics, Russell competed in the 3,200 metres steeplechase. In the first round, he was one of only two athletes in his heat to finish, easily defeating the other runner.  Russell made the pace in the final for the first mile. Afterwards, Russell and American John Eisele fought for the lead until the bell, when Briton Archie Robertson passed Eisele and was only beaten by two yards by Russell, with Eisele 25 yards (23 m) behind.Russell was a Walsall brick worker who ran for Walsall Harriers. His gold medal is extremely rare as it is made of solid gold and this was the only time that the 3200-yard event was held.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Russell", "response": ["Arthur Russell may refer to:", "* Arthur Russell (musician) (1951\u20131992), American cellist, composer, singer, and disco artist", "* Arthur Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill (1869\u20131935), British administrator and rower", "* Arthur Russell (athlete) (1886\u20131972), British athlete", "* Lord Arthur Russell, (1825\u20131892), British Member of Parliament", "* Sir Arthur Russell, 6th Baronet (1878\u20131964), British mineralogist", "* Arthur Russell, character in 1935 film Alice Adams"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3200 metres steeplechase", "response": ["|align=center| 1 || Arthur Russell ||  ||align=center| 10:56.2", "|align=center| 1 || Arthur Russell ||  ||align=center| 10:47.8"]}, {"page": "John Eisele", "response": ["Eisele was the only runner in his first round heat to finish, moving to the final after running the first round in 11:13.6.
