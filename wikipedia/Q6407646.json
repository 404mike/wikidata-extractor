The list is by season, this being the season in which the player's name first appears in surviving sources.\nCricket underwent radical changes during the 18th century. Patronage and popular support enabled it to outgrow its roots as a village pastime and develop into a major sport. In the early 1760s, pitched delivery bowling was introduced and this necessitated the invention of the straight bat: an evolution in bowling and batting techniques that radically changed cricket.\nThe earliest known scorecards date from 1744 but it was not until 1772 that they began to be completed and are preserved on a regular basis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Killick (name)", "response": ["*Killick Erik Hinds (born 1972), American musician", "*Killick Millard (1870\u20131952), British doctor", "*Anthony Killick (1829\u20131881), English cricketer", "*Elizabeth Killick (1924\u20132019), British naval engineer", "*Ernest Harry \"Tim\" Killick (1875\u20131948), English cricketer", "*Esther Killick (1902\u20131960), English physiologist", "*Gordon Killick (1899\u20131962), British rower", "*Graeme Killick, Canadian cross country skier", "*Hammerton Killick (1856-1902), former admiral in the Haitian Navy ", "*Harry Killick (1837\u20131877), English cricketer", "*James Killick (1816-1889) British sea captain, shipowner and entrepreneur", "*Sir John Killick (1919\u20132004), British ambassador", "*Larry Killick (born 1922), American basketball player", "*Marie Killick (1914\u20132000), English audio engineer", "*Paul Killick, British professional ballroom dancer", "*Tim Killick (born 1958), English  actor", "*Tom Killick (1907\u20131953), English cricketer and clergyman", "*William Killick (1855\u20131938), English cricketer", "*Killick (Kent cricketer), English cricketer from the mid-18th century", "* Preserved Killick, steward to Jack Aubrey throughout the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series of novels by Patrick O'Brian", "*Killick (disambiguation)"]}]}}
