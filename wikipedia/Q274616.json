They are from a religious sect in Hell known as the Order of the Gash, describing themselves as \"explorers in the further regions of experience\", and granting sadomasochistic pleasures to those who call upon them. Author David McWilliam notes that the Cenobites are described in more explicitly sexual terms in the book compared with their depictions in the film adaptations. Julia, played by Clare Higgins, was Barker's choice to carry the series as its main antagonist after Hellbound, reducing the Cenobites to a background role. However, fans rallied around Pinhead as the breakout character, and Higgins declined to return to the series.  In The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters, David McWilliam writes that the Cenobites \"provide continuity across the series, as the stories become increasingly stand-alone in nature\"."]}, {"page": "Silent Witness", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Clare Higgins", "* Superintendent Helen Farmer (Clare Higgins)\u00a0\u2013 Series 1.
