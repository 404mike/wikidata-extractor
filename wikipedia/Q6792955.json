Just before the battalion sailed for India he had returned to England to attend the Staff College, Camberley, which he did from 1928 to 1929, and was the youngest student there, aged just 29.Cloake, p. 47 Among his many fellow students were men such as John Harding, Richard McCreery, Gordon MacMillan, Alexander Galloway, Gerard Bucknall, Philip Gregson-Ellis, Alexander Cameron and Cameron Nicholson. In the year senior to him were Eric Dorman-Smith, John Hawkesworth, John Whiteley, Evelyn Barker, Oliver Leese, Ronald Penney, Robert Bridgeman, Philip Christison and numerous others while, in Templer's second year, in the year below, were George Erskine, Harold Freeman-Attwood, Neil Ritchie, Herbert Lumsden, Reginald Denning and Maurice Chilton. Templer's instructors there included Bernard Paget, Henry Pownall and Bernard Montgomery. Due to the Royal Irish Fusiliers being reduced to a single battalion in 1922, and thus promotion in the regiment being slower than in the rest of the army, Templer was forced to transfer to the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), to gain a promotion to captain, which was backdated to 11 August 1928.Heathcote, Anthony pg 274 After graduation from the Staff College, Templer joined the 2nd Battalion of his new regiment, then stationed at Aldershot, in January 1930.Cloake, pps. 49\u201350"]}, {"page": "Manley James (VC)", "response": ["On 27 May 1925 James was promoted to captain and later served as adjutant of the 1st Battalion, Glosters from 12 December 1925 until 14 December 1928.

The instructors in Dempsey's first year included Henry Maitland Wilson, George Giffard, John Clark, James Gammell and Trafford Leigh-Mallory. Boy Browning was the college adjutant. Nearly all of these men were to achieve high rank in the upcoming war.", "Where possible, Main HQ was co-located with Broadhurst's No. 83 (Composite) Group RAF and A Squadron of the GHQ Liaison Regiment (known as Phantom). Broadhurst was apprehensive when he found out that he would be Dempsey's opposite number, as their relationship in Italy had been strained, something Broadhurst attributed to Dempsey's inexperience as a corps commander. Broadhurst found that Dempsey had accepted that he had been wrong, and worked on forging the Army and RAF into a successful team. Dempsey seldom made a move without talking to Broadhurst, and the two gradually became friends. Main HQ was presided over by Dempsey's chief of staff, Brigadier Maurice Chilton, who had been part of his syndicate at Camberley. Chilton and Dempsey would meet every day, usually at Tac HQ. Chilton later became Deputy Adjutant General at 21st Army Group HQ, and he was replaced as chief of staff by Brigadier Harold \"Pete\" Pyman on 23 January 1945. Rear HQ was normally situated  or so further back and contained the rest of Second Army HQ. It was presided over by the Quartermaster General, Brigadier Geoffrey Hardy-Roberts. In all, Second Army HQ had a strength of 189 officers and 970 other ranks."]}, {"page": "Quartermaster-General to the Forces", "response": ["*1955\u20131956 Lieutenant-General Maurice Chilton"]}, {"page": "Chilton (surname)", "response": ["* Maurice Chilton (1898\u20131956) British Army officer"]}, {"page": "Anti-Aircraft Command", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Sir Maurice Chilton (17 April 1953 \u2013 15 May 1955)Chilton at Generals of World War II"]}, {"page": "George William Symes", "response": ["On 1 April 1919, with the war over, Symes stayed in the army and reverted to his permanent rank of lieutenant.
