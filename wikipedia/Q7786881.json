It sought reform of the Irish Parliament, Catholic Emancipation and the repeal of the Penal Laws. By the time the Orange Order was formed, the United Irishmen had become a revolutionary group advocating an independent Irish republic that would \"Unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter\". United Irishmen activity was on the rise, and the government hoped to thwart it by backing the Orange Order from 1796 onward.The Cause of Ireland: From the United Irishmen to Partition, Liz Curtis, Beyond the Pale Publications, Belfast, 1994,  pg.9 Irish nationalist historians Thomas A. Jackson and John Mitchel argued that the government's goal was to hinder the United Irishmen by fomenting sectarianism, thereby creating disunity and disorder under pretence of \"passion for the Protestant religion\".Thomas A Jackson, Ireland Her Own, page 142\u20133 Mitchel wrote that the government invented and spread \"fearful rumours of intended massacres of all the Protestant people by the Catholics\".Mitchel, John. History of Ireland, from the Treaty of Limerick to the Present Time: Vol I. 1869. Page 223. Historian Richard R Madden wrote that \"efforts were made to infuse into the mind of the Protestant feelings of distrust to his Catholic fellow-countrymen\". Thomas Knox, British military commander in Ulster, wrote in August 1796 that \"As for the Orangemen, we have rather a difficult card to play\u00a0... we must to a certain degree uphold them, for with all their licentiousness, on them we must rely for the preservation of our lives and properties should critical times occur\"."]}, {"page": "Jack Fitzgerald", "response": ["By trade he was a bricklayer (as were George Hicks and F. K. Cadman) and after 1913 was on the teaching staff at the LCC School of Building at Brixton. He was an active trade unionist (Operative Bricklayers' Society) and a cyclist, designing and building his own bicycles. Fitzgerald had been active in the Social Democratic Federation from around the turn of the century, being a public speaker and a delegate to SDF Conferences in 1901 (Central branch) and 1902 (Burnbank). Whilst a member of the SDF he had taught classes for the party on Marx's Capital, where one of his students was Thomas A. Jackson, who described him as \"very nearly the best-read man I have ever met\". Along with Horace Hawkins he was expelled by the SDF at its 1904 Conference at Burnley, an action which led to the formation of the Socialist Party of Great Britain. This was chiefly as a result of his unauthorised economics classes, which were continued under SPGB auspices. He was a member of the Provisional Committee of May 1904."]}, {"page": "T. A.
