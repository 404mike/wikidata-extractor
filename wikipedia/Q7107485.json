Andrews scored a try on his d\u00e9but which resulted in a Welsh draw after England's Wavell Wakefield also scored a try. Andrews was selected for the next match in the 1926 Five Nations Championship, this time facing Scotland. Wales lost this match and Andrews was not selected for the final two games of the tournament against Ireland and France. The next season Andrews was back, but in the first game against England, Wales lost 11-9, though Andrews scored his second international try during the game.

Lewis was one of 8 new Welsh caps on the day, and the relative inexperienced team, under the captaincy of Rowe Harding, drew 3-3 with the England team. Lewis was dropped for the rest of the tournament, but was back in 1927, again against England, but this time at Twickenham. Wales lost the match 11-9, though the team played with only 14 men for most of the match, when Newports Dai Jones was injured in the first quarter of an hour. Lewis's last game was for Ossie Male's team against Scotland, again in the 1927 Five Nations Championship. Wales lost at home 5-0 and Lewis was never selected for any future games."]}, {"page": "Lonza Bowdler", "response": ["Although Cross Keys was seen as an unfashionable club at the time, it had already produced two respected internationals in Steve Morris and Ossie Male; therefore although unusual, it was not a surprise when Bowdler was selected for the Welsh rugby team. In 1927 Bowdler was selected to face the touring Australian Waratahs and the next year  made his debut in the Five Nations Championship in a game against England, which was also the last game for Wales captain Rowe Harding. Bowdler played out the entirety of the 1928 Five Nations Championship and the 1929 season. An unsuccessful period in Welsh rugby, Bowdler played through into the early 1930s when the team's fortunes began changing. He missed the 1931 Five Nations Championship, when Wales actually won the tournament, but was selected to play against the 1931 touring South Africans. His final game was at Ravenhill against Ireland in 1933, when Wales lost the selectors dropped 11 players from the squad. Bowdler was one of them."]}, {"page": "Albert Stock", "response": ["Born in Newport, Stock was introduced to rugby while serving in Egypt during World War I. After returning to Wales he joined hard, dock team Pill Harriers, before switching to Newport in 1921. In 1924, Stock was selected to play for Wales against France in the Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Rowe Harding, Stock was part of a ramshackle selection, caused by the late suspension of Ossie Male. Wales won, but unconvincingly."]}, {"page": "Ernie Finch", "response": ["Finch first played senior rugby for local team Pembroke Dock Harlequins before moving to first class team Llanelli in 1922. Finch was first selected for Wales in the late game of the 1924 Five Nations Championship in an away game to France. Although Wales won, it was a messy Welsh performance caused by the decision of the Welsh Rugby Union officials to suspend Welsh player Ossie Male on the trip to Paris. The squad was thrown into turmoil, with several players being forced into unfamiliar positions. Finch managed to get his name on the scoreboard during the game when he scored one of two Welsh tries."]}, {"page": "Jack Gore", "response": ["Gore played all his rugby union for the unfashionable lower level club Blaina, though during this period the Welsh selectors would often choose tough manual workers to represent the forward positions. Gore first represented Wales in the 1924 Five Nations Championship in a match at the Cardiff Arms Park against Ireland. Under the captaincy of Jack Wetter, Gore found himself on the losing team which stopped a run of 9 successive home wins for Wales. His second game was against France and although a win for Wales, it was a poor Welsh performance caused by players being thrown out of position by the selectors decision to suspend Ossie Male on the trip to Paris. Gore was selected later in the year to face the touring New Zealand team. Wales were totally outclassed by the All Blacks, though the forwards put on a spirited display.Billot (1972), pg 68."]}, {"page": "Tommy Rees (rugby)", "response": ["On Christmas Eve 1926, Rees was playing for London Welsh away to Cross Keys. In the first few minutes of the second half, while attempting a tackle, Rees broke his leg.Jones (1985), pg 83. Rees had been a certainty for the 1927 Championship, and after his injury his place was taken by Ossie Male. The next season, Rees was back in the Wales team, and was chosen to face the New South Wales Waratahs at the Cardiff Arms Park. Wales were well beaten, though Rees scored for Wales with another conversion. The selectors kept faith with Rees, and he played his final union international in the opening game of the 1928 tournament, played at Swansea against England."]}, {"page": "Male (surname)", "response": ["*Ossie Male (1893\u20131975), Welsh rugby union player"]}]}}
