From Thesz I learned how to hurt people. He had a little bit of a sadistic side\". LeBell also considers Thesz, Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis and Karl Gotch as the toughest men he has ever known.

Although the matches were predetermined (there were a few notable legitimate contests), the UWF-i was very convincing for its time, promoting a combat-based style featuring a mix of wrestling, submission grappling and kickboxing. In retrospect, UWFi, along with other shoot-style promotions, served as a precursor to mixed martial arts and to popular Japanese MMA promotions, particularly Pride FC.
