Sometime after the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Morgan Edge is depicted as an intelligent, eloquent, and impassioned self-made mogul who has bought out different media outlets including the Daily Planet, leading to the firing of Clark Kent and the resignation of Lois Lane. In Smallville, Edge's company Edge EnerCorp gains ownership of a mine that contains X-Kryptonite which he plans to use to continue experiments in an attempt to create a super-powered army. His previous experiments with help from Dabney Donovan resulted in only one non-flawed subject, his personal assistant Leslie Larr (portrayed by Stacey Farber). His work in Smallville brings him into further conflict with Lois Lane and an alternate John Henry Irons, who comes from an Earth where a similar army led by Superman ravaged Metropolis and murdered John's wife, Lois. Edge is later revealed to be a Kryptonian named Tal-Rho, the son of Lara Lor-Van and Zeta-Rho (portrayed by A.C. Peterson) and thus Superman's maternal half-brother. His escape pod landed in England, where he immediately came into conflict with the local townspeople. He was captured and experimented on before managing to escape, causing him to hate mankind. His goal is to resurrect Krypton on Earth by implanting Kryptonian consciousnesses into human hosts using the X-Kryptonite and the Eradicator. Upon finding Superman's body at the Fortress of Solitude following the defeat of most of the Subjekts, Tal-Rho uses Kryptonian technology to review Superman's memories, discovering his human family. Eventually, Tal-Rho kidnaps Superman's son Jordan and implants Zeta-Rho into him. However, Jordan successfully expels Zeta-Rho from his body and Tal-Rho is finally defeated by Superman and Irons. In season two, Tal-Rho is kept in a special cell that has red solar lights. Superman visited him to see if there were side-effects to the Eradicator conscious due to the painful visions he has. Tal-Rho mentioned that he hasn't experienced them while also claiming that he lost his powers in the solar flare that Irons caused. When the vision happen again following a hostage crisis caused by Phillip Karnowski, Superman gives in to Tal-Rho's deal to make use of his lair as Jordan comes with Superman to keep an eye on Tal-Rho. As Tal-Rho activates the A.I. copy of Lara as she scans Superman, he starts to have the visions again as Jordan learns that Tal-Rho faked losing his powers. After a brief scuffle between Superman and Tal-Rho, Lara tells Superman that his visions are the result of an \"invasive cosmological event\" and tells Tal-Rho that there might be some good in him.
