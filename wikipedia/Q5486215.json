He was awarded his Yorkshire cap in 1929.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Len Hutton", "response": ["Hutton married Dorothy Mary Dennis, the sister of former Yorkshire cricketer Frank Dennis, on 16 September 1939 at Wykeham near Scarborough; they met at an end-of-season dance which Dorothy had attended with her brother. They had two sons: Richard, who later played cricket for Yorkshire and England, in 1942,Howat, p. 55. and John in 1947."]}, {"page": "Bill Bowes", "response": ["Yorkshire at this time was in a period of transition. They had won the championship four times between 1922 and 1925 but had since then been overshadowed by their great rivals Lancashire who had won the title in each of the preceding three seasons. In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established professionals like Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year. Waiting in the wings, however, was Hedley Verity who was then playing in the Lancashire League and made his Yorkshire debut in 1930."]}, {"page": "2000 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 21 November \u2013 Frank Dennis, cricketer (born 1907)"]}, {"page": "Holbeck", "response": ["* Frank Dennis (1907\u20132000), cricketer."]}, {"page": "Oliver Hutton", "response": ["Hutton was born in Johannesburg, South Africa.  His grandfather Sir Leonard Hutton and father Richard Hutton both played Test cricket for England.  His other grandfather Ben Brocklehurst, uncle John Hutton, cousin Simon Dennis, great-uncle Frank Dennis, and elder brother Ben Hutton, all played first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "Alfred Goulder", "response": ["Born in Attercliffe, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, Goulder was a left arm orthodox spinner and left-handed tail end batsman, who made his debut against an 'All England XI' at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, at the end of July 1929.  He did not bat as Alan Barber (100) and Edgar Oldroyd (143) put on 203 for the second wicket, to help Yorkshire post 320 for 4.  He bowled 11 overs and took the wickets of Eddie Dawson and Alan Shipman for 21, before rain forced the abandonment of the final day's play.  His second, and final game, was the County Championship clash against Derbyshire again at Bramall Lane, in August.  Batting at number eleven, he fell leg before wicket to Tommy Mitchell for three runs, and his only success with the ball came when he dismissed Stan Worthington, caught by Frank Dennis, for six.  He finished with a first-class career bowling average of 30.00."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1928\u20131932)", "response": ["It was a time for change in the Yorkshire team.  Worsley had replaced Lupton as captain and Arthur Wood had replaced Dolphin as wicket-keeper.  Abe Waddington had also retired and his replacement was nominally fast bowler Frank Dennis, although Yorkshire often included Wilf Barber as an extra batsman.  Tragically, Yorkshire also lost Roy Kilner who died in April.  Arthur Mitchell now came into the team on a regular basis.  Sutcliffe was becoming one of the more senior players but he still had several stalwart colleagues in Holmes, Oldroyd, Leyland, Rhodes, Robinson and Macaulay.", "Sutcliffe's first-class aggregate in 1930 was 2,312 runs at 64.22 with 6 centuries and a highest score of 173 against Sussex.  Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind Lancashire and Gloucestershire.Webber, p.67.  Alan Barber replaced William Worsley as Yorkshire's amateur captain but played for one season only.  Of greater significance was the retirement of the man who many saw as the true Yorkshire captain, Wilfred Rhodes.  But one legend was replaced by another as Hedley Verity immediately stepped into Rhodes' boots, making 10 championship appearances and taking 52 wickets.  Sutcliffe made only 13 appearances in the championship as a result of Test calls and his thumb injury.  The team in 1930 lacked balance with a lot of changes taking place but a typical line-up was Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Mitchell, Robinson, Wood, Rhodes or Verity, Alan Barber, Macaulay and Bowes.  The likes of Wilf Barber, Frank Dennis and future captain Frank Greenwood made occasional appearances."]}, {"page": "Michael Farebrother", "response": ["Farebrother was born at Chelsea in February 1920. He was educated at Eton College, before going up to Trinity College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against a combined Minor Counties cricket team at Oxford in 1939. Playing as a left-arm fast-medium bowler, he took the wickets of Frank Dennis and David Watson in the Minor Counties first innings, while in their second innings he dismissed Alan Parnaby and Watson, finishing with match figures of 4 for 128. With the declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, Farebrother's first-class career came to a premature end, though he did complete his studies."]}, {"page": "John Hutton (cricketer)", "response": ["Hutton was born to the Test cricketer and former England captain Len Hutton and his wife, Dorothy, at Pudsey in May 1946. He was educated at Repton School, captaining the school cricket team in 1964. Hutton played for the Yorkshire Second XI, but was unable to follow in the footsteps of his father and brother, Richard, who both played for Yorkshire at senior level. He toured East Africa with the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1973/74, playing a single first-class match against East Africa at Nairobi. He batted in both MCC innings, scoring 12 runs in their first innings before he was dismissed by Vasant Tapu and 39 runs in their second innings, before being dismissed by Zulfiqar Ali. With his right-arm medium pace bowling, he dismissed Jawahir Shah and Jagoo Shah in the East African first and second innings respectively to finish with match figures of 2 for 47. Alongside his brother, he unveiled a blue plaque in honour of his father and Herbert Sutcliffe at Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club in October 2016. His uncle Frank Dennis and nephew Ben Hutton both played in over fifty first-class matches."]}]}}
