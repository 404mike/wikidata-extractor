He earned his award by going ashore and single-handedly destroying a Turkish naval gun battery while a lieutenant commander with the fleet stationed off the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli campaign in the First World War.\nAfter these exploits, he was badly wounded on the front line on the Gallipoli Peninsula, but recovered and served continuously for the remainder of the war and into the Russian Civil War. In 1939 aged 57, he again volunteered for military service and spent three more years at sea, commanding convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic. During his lengthy career, Robinson remained a highly regarded officer who had served through four wars.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Eric Gascoigne Robinson || Royal Navy || 1915 || First World War || Dardanelles"]}, {"page": "Order of the Sacred Treasure", "response": ["* Eric Gascoigne Robinson (1882\u20131965) "]}, {"page": "Order of Saint Anna", "response": ["*Eric Gascoigne Robinson"]}, {"page": "Eric Robinson", "response": ["* Eric Gascoigne Robinson (1882\u20131965), British Victoria Cross winner"]}, {"page": "Convoy commodore", "response": ["* Admiral Eric Gascoigne Robinson, V.C. who served for three years.

The men landed unopposed, but the detachment from Vengeance quickly came under fire from Ottoman infantry on the far side of Kumkale. Lieutenant-Commander Eric Gascoigne Robinson, who led Vengeances demolition party, went forward by himself to destroy an Ottoman anti-aircraft gun, then led his detachment to destroy a second anti-aircraft gun and the one remaining gun at the Orkanie battery.
