In doing so he became one of the youngest captains in the team's history. Four successful seasons followed, with Murphy winning two All Stars, three Ulster Senior Football Championships (including two consecutively) and the Sam Maguire Cup, only the second player in the county's history to raise that trophy as team captain. He received the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final man of the match award and his catch from a Karl Lacey pass, turn leaving his marker Kevin Keane clutching at air and rocket strike past David Clarke into the roof of the Mayo net in the opening minutes of that game to set the score at 1-0 to 0-0 earned him the Championship Matters Goal of the Championship.
