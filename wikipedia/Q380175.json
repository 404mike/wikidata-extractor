He scored a winning goal in the 2007 Russian Cup final for Lokomotiv. O'Connor struggled to settle in Russia, and he returned to the United Kingdom later that year by signing for Birmingham City. O'Connor struggled to hold a place in the Birmingham side due to injuries, and he spent most of the 2010\u201311 season with Barnsley. He then returned to Hibernian for the 2011\u201312 season, scoring 12 goals in 33 league appearances.
