It tells the story of Charles Marlow, a sailor who takes on an assignment from a Belgian trading company as a ferry-boat captain in the African interior. The novel is widely regarded as a critique of European colonial rule in Africa, whilst also examining the themes of power dynamics and morality. Although Conrad does not name the river where the narrative takes place, at the time of writing the Congo Free State, the location of the large and economically important Congo River, was a private colony of Belgium's King Leopold II. Marlow is given a text by Kurtz, an ivory trader working on a trading station far up the river, who has \"gone native\" and is the object of Marlow's expedition. ", "Charles Marlow, the narrator, tells his story to friends aboard Nellie, a boat anchored on the River Thames near Gravesend, of how he became captain of a river steamboat for an ivory trading company. As a child, Marlow was fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly Africa. The image of a river on the map particularly fascinated Marlow. "]}, {"page": "Joseph Conrad", "response": ["For the natural surroundings of the high seas, the Malay Archipelago and South America, which Conrad described so vividly, he could rely on his own observations. What his brief landfalls could not provide was a thorough understanding of exotic cultures. For this he resorted, like other writers, to literary sources. When writing his Malayan stories, he consulted Alfred Russel Wallace's The Malay Archipelago (1869), James Brooke's journals, and books with titles like Perak and the Malays, My Journal in Malayan Waters, and Life in the Forests of the Far East. When he set about writing his novel Nostromo, set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, he turned to The War between Peru and Chile; Edward Eastwick, Venezuela: or, Sketches of Life in a South American Republic (1868); and George Frederick Masterman, Seven Eventful Years in Paraguay (1869).  As a result of relying on literary sources, in Lord Jim, as J. I. M. Stewart writes, Conrad's \"need to work to some extent from second-hand\" led to \"a certain thinness in Jim's relations with the... peoples... of Patusan...\" This prompted Conrad at some points to alter the nature of Charles Marlow's narrative to \"distanc[e] an uncertain command of the detail of Tuan Jim's empire.\"", "In 1975 the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe published an essay, \"An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'\", which provoked controversy by calling Conrad a \"thoroughgoing racist\". Achebe's view was that Heart of Darkness cannot be considered a great work of art because it is \"a novel which celebrates... dehumanisation, which depersonalises a portion of the human race.\" Referring to Conrad as a \"talented, tormented man\", Achebe notes that Conrad (via the protagonist, Charles Marlow) reduces and degrades Africans to \"limbs\", \"ankles\", \"glistening white eyeballs\", etc., while simultaneously (and fearfully) suspecting a common kinship between himself and these natives\u2014leading Marlow to sneer the word \"ugly.\" Achebe also cited Conrad's description of an encounter with an African: \"A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days.\" Achebe's essay, a landmark in postcolonial discourse, provoked debate, and the questions it raised have been addressed in most subsequent literary criticism of Conrad."]}, {"page": "Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)", "response": ["Kurtz is a central fictional character in Joseph Conrad's 1899  novella Heart of Darkness.

Jim then finds work as a ship chandler's clerk in ports of the East Indies, always succeeding in the job then leaving abruptly when the memory of the Patna incident catches up with him. In Bangkok, he gets in a fistfight. Marlow realises that Jim needs a new situation, something that will take him far away from modern ports and keep him occupied so that he can finally forget his guilt. Marlow consults his friend Stein, who sees that Jim is a romantic and considers his situation. Stein offers Jim to be his trade representative or factor in Patusan, a village on a remote island shut off from most commerce, which Jim finds to be exactly what he needs."]}, {"page": "Giant Rat of Sumatra", "response": ["* In Charlie Marlow and the Giant Rat of Sumatra, a 2012 novel by Spanish author Alberto L\u00f3pez Aroca, the Norwegian Sigerson (Sherlock Holmes in disguise) travels in 1893 to the Island of Mist, near Sumatra.
