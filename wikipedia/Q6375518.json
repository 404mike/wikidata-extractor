She posed for teen magazines until she was 19.\nIn 1999, she signed as an ambassador with the lingerie company Gossard for their new \"Ultrabra Superboost\". The bra proved popular and was advertised extensively, and even proved controversial when the advertising campaign was considered too racy for British television. This success led Gossard to extend Groombridge's contract, and she became the face of Gossard's entire product line.\nShe has appeared as a cover girl in several magazines, including Esquire, Maxim and FHM, and she appears regularly in FHM's annual \"100 sexiest women\" poll.\nGroombridge had a small part in the 2005 Steven Seagal film Submerged, and in September 2007 she had a larger role in the romantic comedy film Virgin Territory, playing the character Elissa. She has two further films in the can, Coffee Sex You and Shifty.\nShe has two sons, Gilbert and Percy.  She has largely retired from acting and modelling to focus on raising them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Incredible (What I Meant to Say)", "response": ["After Darius has an argument with his girlfriend, played by model Kate Groombridge, he tries to find her to apologise, but the train he thinks she is on leaves before he can say sorry.
