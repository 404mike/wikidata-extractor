He made his 500th appearance for the club when they beat Stenhousemuir in January 1999. Caven was club captain when the Spiders won their first and only trophy of his years at Hampden, the Scottish Football League Third Division championship in 1999\u201300. On 15 April 2000, he broke the 80-year-old Queen's Park appearance record set by J.B. McAlpine, in a 2\u20130 victory over Montrose at Links Park. He also scored 96 league goals for the club.\nCaven retired from playing in June 2001 and joined the club's committee. The team struggled in the early part of the 2001\u201302 season, however, and Caven made a comeback. He finally retired at the end of that season, as Queen's Park finished 10th in the Third Division. He is still serving on the club committee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queen's Park F.C.", "response": ["Queen's struggled with top-flight football and the professional sides which surrounded them. An early high-point was a 1\u20130 victory over Celtic at the opening of the new Hampden Park in 1903. By previous standards, however, unspectacular seasons followed and the club even finished in the relegation zone on five occasions. Queen's were spared by vote until 1922 when, after a few solid seasons, the team were eventually relegated in second-last place. Queen's bounced back immediately, winning Division Two at the first attempt. In a league season of 24 victories and only five defeats, the Spiders even managed a 4\u20133 win over Celtic in the Glasgow Cup, with James McAlpine scoring a hat-trick. McAlpine's fine play inspired Queen's to their greatest ever placing in the Scottish League, when they finished 5th in Division One in 1929. He would go on to set a goal scoring record for the club and his appearance record was only beaten by Ross Caven at the turn of the next century. In 1928, the same side also came closest to any Spiders team since 1900 to winning the Scottish Cup but lost 2\u20131 to Celtic in the semi-finals.", "Recovery took a while but eventually a good side featuring Stevie Ross, Kenny Brannigan, Ian McCall and Ross Caven finished 4th in 1985\u201386\u00a0\u2013 winning three more games than the Championship side of 1981. Queen's lost narrowly by 2\u20131 at Celtic Park in the Fourth round of the Scottish Cup in the February 1986.", "The club's constitution was changed prior to the appointment of the next manager, which meant that Queen's could sign former professionals provided they were not paid by the club. Former Dundee manager John McCormack was unveiled in July 1998 as the new head coach. Like Eddie Hunter, McCormack succeeded in winning the league after just two seasons. The new boss used the new legislation to great effect and even persuaded the club to allow the loaning of professionals. The ex-pros and the committed amateurs combined to give Queen's a superb start to the league season and it was November before defeat was felt. A 4\u20130 loss to challengers Forfar Athletic towards the end of the season was quickly forgotten as Queen's won their last five matches, clinching the Championship at Cowdenbeath on the final day of 1999\u20132000. The addition of ex-pros such as Neil Inglis, Paul Martin, Graham Connell and Johnny Whelan helped. The late loan signing of Paul Walker from Stranraer also proved to be very shrewd as he scored two winning goals in the final run-in. After nearly 20 years of service to the club, Ross Caven won a Championship medal and there was also success for the hard-working Danny Ferry who had been with Queen's through the lean spells of the 90s."]}, {"page": "List of one-club men in association football", "response": ["*Ross Caven (Queen's Park): player 1982\u20132002; director 2001\u2013present."]}, {"page": "List of Queen's Park F.C. players", "response": ["Ross Caven holds the record for the greatest number of appearances for Queen's Park, having made 594 between 1982 and 2002.
