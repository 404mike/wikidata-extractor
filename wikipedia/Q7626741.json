He accompanied Worcestershire on their 1993\u201394 tour of Zimbabwe, scoring 30 against a Matabeleland Invitation XI at Bulawayo. In 1994 he was almost a one-day specialist for Worcestershire, turning out in nine List A matches but only three first-class games; these were the last first-class matches of his career.
