While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the mid-to-late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and thin leads. Power Windows went to No. 2 in Canada while peaking at No. 9 and 10 in the UK and US, respectively. The lead track, \"Big Money\" made the Top 50 in Canada, the UK and US, plus No. 4 on the US Mainstream Rock Chart. Hold Your Fire represents both an extension of the guitar style found on Power Windows, and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.

Rush wanted to continue to work with Hine due to his accomplished songwriting, the feedback he gave their songs and his ability for the group to achieve a looser sound than previous albums.

He liked its mid-range and \"rich\" bottom end sound, and the fact that he did not have to add much equalisation. He first learned of the instrument when the band were recording in England, and knew that bassist Percy Jones used one on Brand X albums, of which he was a big fan. Lee played one at the suggestion of Peter Collins during the recording of Power Windows (1985). Lee's bass was mixed closer to Peart's bass drum range which freed up space in the music for guitar parts. Peart also changed his sound and did not make a conscious decision to avoid electronics altogether, but found that most of the songs did not benefit from him playing on an electronic kit and instead mostly used acoustic drums. Peart realized that he had the tendency for his drum parts to be \"too organized, too architectural\" on an album, so for Roll the Bones he deliberately had spots on songs that were unrehearsed and recorded them on the day of recording with the intention of capturing more spontaneous playing."]}, {"page": "Mike Stock (musician)", "response": ["Stock had briefly worked with Pete Waterman in 1980 when John Milton, Mark Stock and Mike wrote a song \u2013 \"One Nine for a Lady Breaker\" \u2013 for a CB radio club.

By early November, eight songs had been written, which the group felt wasn't enough for the album to have a good amount of musical variety. Peart said, \"We decided we'd go a bit further this time.

Though Rush felt confident enough to undertake production duties themselves, they still wanted someone they could trust and to provide an objective point of view to their ideas. Among the various candidates was English producer, songwriter, and keyboardist Rupert Hine, whose experience with a variety of artists attracted the group. Peart recalled the time when they presented their ideas to Hine: \"We were a little bemused [...] at the end of some of them he actually seemed to be laughing! We looked at each other, eyebrows raised as if to say: \"He thinks our songs are funny?\" But evidently it was a laugh of pleasure; he stayed 'til the end\". At Hine's suggestion, the group brought in Stephen W. Tayler as the recording and mixing engineer.

Initially, they talked to a lot of young producers, but they soon realized that there was little to gain from someone who had worked on fewer albums than the group had released over its career and sought someone experienced. Rush chose English producer Peter Collins who'd co-produced Power Windows (1985) and Hold Your Fire (1987) with the band. Lee said that the band had remained friendly with Collins, and noticed he'd developed as a producer since they'd last worked with him, including his work with more American rock bands. \"As soon as we talked we knew it would be great [...] and he agreed with the vision of what we saw; and his comments, criticizing the past couple records, sonically anyway, were very much in line with the direction we wanted to go, and we thought, 'Bingo! Here you go, this is what we need.' Collins had different engineers in mind to work with, so a \"laborious but interesting search\" took place to find someone suitable that involved hearing tapes from artists worldwide. In the end, they chose Kevin \"The Caveman\" Shirley for the recording; Lee said it was because of his \"raw\" and \"natural\" sound, which required minimal use of reverb which was difficult for the band to get used to at first.
