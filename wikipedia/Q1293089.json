Until that time the material was known as gum elastic or by its Native American name (via French) caoutchouc. Nairne sold natural rubber erasers for the high price of three shillings per half-inch cube. According to Nairne, he inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, discovered rubber's erasing properties, and began selling rubber erasers. The invention was described by Joseph Priestley on April 15, 1770, in a footnote: \"I have seen a substance excellently adapted to the purpose of wiping from paper the mark of black-lead-pencil. ... It is sold by Mr. Nairne, Mathematical Instrument-Maker, opposite the Royal-Exchange.\"See the footnote on page xv at the end of the preface to the following:  In 1770 the word rubber was in general use for any object used for rubbing; the word became attached to the new material sometime between 1770 and 1778.R.B.

He had begun collecting detailed meteorological data as soon as he set foot in India, at Madras, and is known to have taken measurements three times a day, using Ramsden barometers and Nairne thermometers, made by then reputed scientific instrument makers, Jesse Ramsden and Edward Nairne. He trained under John Hope, who was the curator of the Edinburgh botanical garden as well an experimental physiologist. Roxburgh's interest in systematic meteorology may have stemmed from the influence of John Hope as well as his experiences at the Royal Society of Arts which, in the early 1770s, was greatly influenced by the climatic theories of Stephen Hales and Duhamel du Monceau. Such detailed measurements over many years led him to form an opinion on widespread famine and climate change in the empire."]}, {"page": "Electrostatic generator", "response": ["In 1785, N.

Edward Nairne developed an electrostatic generator for medical purposes in 1787 that had the ability to generate either positive or negative electricity, the first of these being collected from the prime conductor carrying the collecting points and the second from another prime conductor carrying the friction pad.

Subsequently, Michael Faraday used EWM to deposit thin gold films through the solidification of vaporized metal on adjacent surfaces. Then, vapor deposits of metal gas as a result of EWM were studied by August Toepler during the 1800s. Spectrography investigation of the process, led by J.A. Anderson, became widespread in the 1900s. The spectrography experiments enabled a better understanding and subsequently the first glimpses of practical application. The mid 20th century saw experiments with EWM as a light source and for the production of nanoparticles in aluminum, uranium and plutonium wires. Congruently, Luis \u00c1lvarez and Lawrence H. Johnston of the Manhattan Project found use for EWM in the development of nuclear detonators."]}, {"page": "Thomas Blunt (optician)", "response": ["Blunt was apprenticed in 1760 to Edward Nairne (1726\u20131806), whose partner he later became.

Thomas's birth  date has yet to be discovered. His burial record stated that he was 83 years old when he died on 16 March 1823, giving a birth year of 1739 or 1740. An obituary gave his age as 84. Yet, those dates would mean that Thomas was 20\u201321 years old when he began his apprenticeship, which is rather late in life.

His scientific interests were far-reaching; he was as curious about natural philosophy and chemistry as he was about medicine and botany. He was particularly interested in experiments and research on the uses of electricity that were being conducted by colleagues like Joseph Priestley. In the 1760s, Lane invented an instrument that could measure the strength of the electricity discharged from a Leyden jar. Benjamin Franklin used this device\u2014known as \"Lane's electrometer\"\u2014in his study of atmospheric electricity. In collaboration with his colleague Henry Cavendish, Lane also created a torpedo that could dispense electric shocks. It was on the strength of his research on electricity that he became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1770. This research also led to his 1777 selection for a committee charged with discovering the ideal shape for lightning rods; this committee comprised several other prominent scientists of the day, including high-ranking members of the Royal Society and Edward Nairne. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1772."]}]}}
