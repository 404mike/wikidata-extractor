Langham first took the championship by defeating George Gutteridge on 23 November 1846.  Langham was considered a scientific boxer, and known for using sharp, well-timed blows, particularly with his left, though he was right handed.  He was a 1992 inductee into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and a mentor to the British boxers Tom King and Jem Mace.Roberts, James, and Skutt, Alexander,Boxing Register, (2006) International Boxing Hall of Fame, McBooks Press, Ithaca, New York, pg. 34", "After retiring from the ring, Nat married Elizabeth Watson on 10 December 1853 at St Martins in the Fields, near his home in Westminster.

In his boxing retirement, he became the matchmaking manager of the first official English heavyweight champion, Jem Mace, and occasionally mentored Mace's student Tom King.

Capitalizing on his fame as a boxer, Langham had placed a well lit sign outside his pub that read \"King of the Middleweights\".

His patrons included high ranking naval officers, powerful businessmen, and members of Parliament.  Several upper crust boxing students and alumni from Cambridge University were boxing students of Langham when he lived in Cambridge and may have remained supporters of his club.  Tom Sayers found a worthy adversary to box and spar with at the club when his career was flagging.  Morning boxing matches for purses were staged in the club and sometimes in remote spots closer to Epsom, and were often preceded by lengthy late night meals followed by the Club's prized plum pudding.  Bouts inside the club sometimes featured boxers fighting in the nude, for the unique tastes of some of the aristocratic patrons.  Meals were famously consumed inside a regulation 24 square foot boxing ring, despite the tight fit as Langham acted as Master of Ceremonies.  Aristocratic patrons included James Grimston, known as Lord Verulam, a former member of both the House of Lords and Commons, Lord Caledon, and Admiral Lord Edward Russell.  Other wealthy patrons included Lord Robert Grimston, brother of James, Sir Robert Peel, amateur boxer and son of the Prime Minister, and Robert's brother Royal Navy Captain William Peel, also an accomplished amateur boxer.  Other distinguished patrons included Royal Navy Commander William Hope-Johnstone and Brown and Harris of the London Stock Exchange.

By one reliable account, the ring used was only sixteen feet square, eight square feet shorter than the regulation size. Mace was said to still be suffering from a strained left foot or ankle.  In a close physical matching, Goss was nearly the same height, and only a few pounds lighter, at around 158 pounds, not considered in the heavyweight division today.  Goss, though he had the vitality of a man nearly seven years younger, did not gain from the advantage, as Mace's experience, skill, and conditioning seemed to count for more than the wear he'd received from his years in the ring by age 35.  Mace deftly avoided Goss's strong rushes with a shift of his shoulders or a bob of his head, showing great flexibility and speed.  In the third round, Mace tripped Goss by extending his left foot behind Goss and pushing him down.  Mace could strike or counter quickly, particularly using his left, and often did so under Goss's defenses, even in the early rounds where he scored early and with precision.  Mace, in the 14th through 20th rounds, got the better of Goss, frequently striking his left eye with his right fist.  At the end of the match in the 21st round, Mace remained strong, but Goss was groggy and weak.

A rematch was fought between the two in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 23, 1877, this time with both wearing boxing gloves, in which he lost. Despite this, he earned a reputation as a \"game and scientific boxer\" from his matches with Dwyer and was referred to by some newspapers as \"the ex-heavyweight champion of America\". It was reported that he was \"almost the only American who could any stand\" against Jem Mace when the boxing champion arrived in the U.S. and the two sparred with each other throughout the country."]}, {"page": "Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame", "response": ["* Jem Mace (2014) "]}, {"page": "Herbert Slade", "response": ["Former champion boxer Jem Mace was Slade's discoverer and exhibition partner.Personal.

Allen's eyes were injured by the eighth, particularly the right one and he took more punishment in the round.  Both men attempted to put the other in a headlock unsuccessfully, a strategy permissible by the lax London Prize Rules that governed the fight. By the tenth, Allen had taken too much punishment to stand long, particularly to his eyes, which were battered.  At the end of the round Allen threw Mace to the ground, but Allen was the more injured and could not continue the match, his seconds throwing up the sponge.  Allen's arm was badly injured or broken.  Each contestant received a large purse of $2,500.\"Fight Between Mace and Allen\", New Orleans Republican, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 1, 11 May 1870."]}]}}
