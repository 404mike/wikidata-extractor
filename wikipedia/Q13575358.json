E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because \"what they seek is the oxygen of respectability\", and doing so would \"give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all\". He suggests that creationists \"don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public.\" In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that \"among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know.\" When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word theory, Dawkins stated that \"evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening.\" He added that \"it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English.\""]}, {"page": "Queen Mary University of London", "response": ["*Edgar Andrews \u2013 British physicist and engineer (founded the Department of Materials at Queen Mary in 1967)"]}, {"page": "A.

Other notable attendees included Dr. Melvin Calvin, the 1961 winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry; Dr. Charles Overberger, then the vice-president for research at the University of Michigan; and Herbert D. \"Ted\" Doan, president of the Michigan Foundation for Advanced Research, which was MMI's primary financial backer in its early days."]}, {"page": "Evangelical Times", "response": ["* Prof Edgar Andrews (1998-2008)"]}, {"page": "Edgar H.
