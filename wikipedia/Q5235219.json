In the match against Nottinghamshire at County Ground, Taunton, he took one catch and made one stumping, and contributed two runs to Somerset's second innings after not batting in the first.Hughes played for Somerset's second eleven in the Minor Counties and the Second Eleven Championship over many years, with his final appearance for the side in 1977. He also played Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire in the 1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Hughes", "response": ["David Hughes may refer to:", "*David Hughes (illustrator), British illustrator", "*David Hughes (Emmerdale), fictional character in the ITV soap opera Emmerdale", "*David Hughes (Eos I\u00e2l) (1794\u20131862), Welsh poet and publisher", "*David Hughes (illustrator), English artist and illustrator", "*David Hughes (novelist) (1930\u20132005), British novelist", "*David Hughes (bass player) (born 1971), Swedish musician", "*David Hughes (musician) (born 1960), English keyboardist", "*David Hughes (tenor) (1925\u20131972), English singer", "*David Hughes (astronomer) (born 1941), English astronomer specialising in comets", "** 4205 David Hughes, an asteroid", "*David Hughes (Hertfordshire cricketer) (born 1978), Irish cricketer", "*David Hughes (Lancashire cricketer) (born 1947), English cricketer", "*David Hughes (Somerset cricketer) (born 1934), English cricketer", "*David Hughes (American football) (born 1959), American football player", "*David Hughes (footballer, born 1943), English footballer", "*David Hughes (footballer, born 1958), English footballer", "*David Hughes (footballer, born 1972), Welsh footballer", "*David Hughes (footballer, born 1978), Welsh footballer", "*David Hughes (hurler) (born 1967), Irish hurler", "*David Hughes (sailor) (born 1978), American sailor", "*David Hughes (college principal) (1753/1754\u20131817), Principal of Jesus College, Oxford", "*David Hughes (priest) (1785\u20131850), Welsh Anglican priest", "*David Hughes (RAF officer) (1899\u2013?), First World War flying ace", "*David Hughes (railroad executive), interim president and CEO of Amtrak, 2005\u20132006", "*Ysgol David Hughes, a school in Wales named after a local philanthropist"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* David Hughes (1955) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "David Garfield Hughes", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Hughes (Somerset cricketer) "]}]}}
