She appeared in 17 Test matches for England between 1949 and 1963. She primarily played domestic cricket for Middlesex.A right-handed batter, she scored 652 runs in Tests at an average of 24.14, with the highlight an unbeaten century in her last game. She was also an effective bowler, and bowled both medium pace and left-arm orthodox spin. She took 77 Test wickets (which remains the all-time Test record) at an average of just 13.49. She took a remarkable 7 for 6 against Australia, the best figures in English women's Test history.

They then moved on to Australia, where their series began with an abandoned match at North Sydney Oval in February, and the second Test at St Kilda had the first day rained off. When the teams came in to bat, though, Duggan set a women's Test record; she claimed seven Australian batters, all for single-digit scores, and in 14.5 overs she conceded six runs, bettering Maclagan's previous best of seven for 10.Women's Test Best Innings Bowling, from Cricinfo, retrieved 24 August 2006 The record stood for 38 years.
