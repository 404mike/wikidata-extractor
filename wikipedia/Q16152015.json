In its final years, the fair was set out in the following format: starting at the beginning of the shopping area of Front Street, up to the Cresswell Arms public house flowing into Church Point car park and continuing along the seafront promenade. The lifeboat house and boatyard became the music venue. A stage replaced the boats and the lifeboat house opened its doors, serving food and afternoon tea. Appearances were made by Slade, Leo Sayer and TV show Gladiators star Michael Van Wijk."]}, {"page": "Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior", "response": ["Instead of using painted artwork for the game's box, Palace Software used photos of hired models. The photos, also used in advertising campaigns, featured Michael Van Wijk (who would later become famous as 'Wolf' in the TV series Gladiators) as the hero and bikini-clad Maria Whittaker, a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid's Page 3 topless photo shoots. Palace Software's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom, with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game. The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarians profile, helping to make it a commercial success. Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat, and dashes of humour. The game was Palace Software's critical hit; boosted by Barbarians success, Palace Software expanded its operations and started publishing other developers' work. In 1988, the company released a sequel, Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax.", "Feeling that most of the artwork on game boxes at that time were \"pretty poor\", Brown suggested that an \"iconic fantasy imagery with real people would be a great hook for the publicity campaign.\" His superiors agreed and arranged a photo shoot, hiring models Michael Van Wijk and Maria Whittaker to pose as the barbarian and princess. Whittaker was a topless model, who frequently appeared on Page 3 of the tabloid, The Sun. She wore a tiny bikini for the shoot while Van Wijk, wearing only a loincloth, posed with a sword. Palace Software also packaged a poster of Whittaker in costume with the game. Just before release, the company discovered that fellow developer Psygnosis was producing a game also titled Barbarian, albeit of the platform genre. After several discussions, Palace Software appended the subtitle \"The Ultimate Warrior\" to differentiate the two products."]}, {"page": "Maria Whittaker", "response": ["In the late 1980s, she appeared with Michael Van Wijk (also known as Wolf from the Gladiators television show) on the cover of Palace Software's computer games Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior and Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax."]}, {"page": "Salome's Last Dance", "response": ["* Michael Van Wijk as 2nd Soldier"]}, {"page": "Wolf (name)", "response": ["*Michael Van Wijk, known by the pseudonym Wolf on the television series Gladiators"]}, {"page": "List of controversial video games", "response": ["| 1987 || Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior || Acorn Electron, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum || Palace Software || The cover art of the game, which featured bikini-clad Maria Whittaker, a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid's Page Three topless photo shoots, and Michael Van Wijk, who was only wearing a loincloth, provoked outrage in the United Kingdom.
