He joined the North Lancashire regiment as Lieutenant in 1884 later joining the Madras Staff Corps (6 Feb 1884) and rising to become Deputy Assistant Commissary General on the Indian Staff Corps. He died from a shot fired during the Tirah Campaign.\nHe was a Member of the Bombay Natural History Society, a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London and from 1891 of the Entomological Society of London. His India collections are conserved by the Natural History Museum, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Indian natural history", "response": ["Guha, Ramachandra 2003. Churchill in Bangalore. The Hindu, Sunday 21 December 2003. Lepidopterists include Edward Yerbury Watson (?\u20131897) who took an interest in the Hesperiidae, Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1906\u20131963), T. R. Bell (1863\u20131948) and Charles B. Antram (1864\u20131955). However entomology beyond butterfly collection gained importance due to the growing economic importance of agriculture. The position of an Imperial Entomologist was created at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute (later the Indian Agricultural Research Institute). Entomologists who left a mark include William Stephen Atkinson (1820\u20131876), E. Brunetti (1862\u20131927), Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher (1878\u20131950), Sir George Hampson (1860\u20131936), H. E. Andrewes (1863\u20131950), G. M. Henry (1891\u20131983), Colonel C. T. Bingham (1848\u20131908), William Monad Crawford (1872\u20131941), W. H. Evans (1876\u20131956), Michael Lloyd Ferrar, F. C.

Senior-White ( 1891\u20131954), Edwin Felix Thomas Atkinson (1840\u20131890) and Charles Swinhoe (1836\u20131923). With forests being of major economic value, there was an interest in forest entomology. Forest entomology started with E. P. Stebbing (1870\u20131960) and he was followed by many including A. D. Imms (1880\u20131949), who is better known for his entomology textbook that continues with new revisions to remain a standard reference. Other entomologists associated with forest entomology included C. F. C. Beeson. Malaria was a widespread disease and studies on mosquitoes gained special importance. Ronald Ross (1857\u20131932) established the link between mosquitoes and malaria during his researches when positioned at Bangalore, Ootacamund and Secunderabad. Sir S. R. Christophers (1873\u20131978) pioneered in the study of mosquitoes and was involved in the creation of the Malaria Survey of India. Others involved in this field included J. A. Sinton (1884\u20131956).Rao, BR Subba (1998) History of entomology in India.
