The methodology of the S\u00e1nchez-Bayo & Wyckhuys study has been questioned; the search string used to sift through the scientific literature was \"(insect* + decline* + survey)\". This meant that the authors identified studies finding insect declines, but may have missed those that found increases in insect populations or stability. In assessing the study methodology, an editorial in Global Change Biology stated, \"An unbiased review of the literature would still find declines, but estimates based on this 'unidirectional' methodology are not credible. However, according to the authors of that review \"more than half of the surveys were obtained from references cited in other reports\" and \"the 73 insect surveys cover all species in a particular taxon \u2013 irrespective of them exhibiting declines, stable or increasing trends in their distribution or abundance\".Entomology professor Simon Leather suggested that media reports of an \"Ecological Armageddon\" may be exaggerated and advocated for more funding to allow better collection of long term data on the decline.

The British entomologist Simon Leather said that he hoped media reports, following the study, of an \"ecological Armageddon\" had been exaggerated; he argued that the Krefeld and other studies should be a wake-up call, and that more funding is needed to support long-term studies. The Krefeld study's authors were not able to link the decline to climate change or pesticides, he wrote, but they suggested that intensive farming was involved. While agreeing with their conclusions, he cautioned that \"the data are based on biomass, not species, and the sites were not sampled continuously and are not globally representative\". As a result of the Krefeld and other studies, the German government established an \"Action Programme for Insect Protection\".", "Anecdotal evidence for insect decline has been offered by those who recall apparently greater insect abundance in the 20th century. Entomologist Simon Leather recalls that, in the 1970s, windows of Yorkshire houses he visited on his early-morning paper round would be \"plastered with tiger moths\" attracted by the house's lighting during the night. Tiger moths have now largely disappeared from the area. Another anecdote is recalled by environmentalist Michael McCarthy concerning the vanishing of the \"moth snowstorms\", a relatively common sight in the UK in the 1970s and earlier. Moth snowstorms occurred when moths congregated with such density that they could appear like a blizzard in the beam of automobile headlights. A 2019 survey  by Mongabay of 24 entomologists working on six continents found that on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst, all the scientists rated the severity of the insect decline crisis as being between 8\u201310.", "In the UK, 27 ecologists and entomologists signed an open letter to The Guardian in March 2019, calling on the British research establishment to investigate the decline. Signatories included Simon Leather, Stuart Reynolds (former president of the Royal Entomological Society), John Krebs and John Lawton (both former presidents of the Natural Environment Research Council), Paul Brakefield, George McGavin, Michael Hassell, Dave Goulson, Richard Harrington (editor of the Royal Entomological Society's magazine, Antenna), Kathy Willis and Jeremy Thomas."]}]}}
