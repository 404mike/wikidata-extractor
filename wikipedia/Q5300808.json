Before reaching his twelfth birthday, he had already become an accomplished pianist, violinist and clarinettist, although he lacked any drive to pursue music as a career. After teaching himself to play the bass guitar, he began to collaborate and write with others, later developing his skills on the other side of the mixing desk.Parmenter is half of the duo The Idles, a partnership formed with the guitarist and pianist Joseph Fuller, who frequently gigged and collaborated with other musicians in Reading, Berkshire. They developed a countrywide fan base after receiving national airplay on BBC Radio 1. Together they championed the music scenes of Reading and nearby communities.Since appearing on Later... with Jools Holland, Parmenter has performed and collaborated with John Power, KT Tunstall and Jack White.\nDespite the wide global audience his work has reached, Parmenter has consistently shunned fame and fought to maintain what he describes as \"a regular lifestyle\". Since 2010, he has begun to formalise his retirement from the music industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Parmenter", "response": ["*Doug Parmenter, British musician"]}]}}
