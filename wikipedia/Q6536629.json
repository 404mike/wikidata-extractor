Stevenage held their nerve from twelve yards to win 7\u20136 on penalties to ensure they progressed to the second round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2005.

Adkins began his time on the South Coast poorly, leading Southampton to their fourth consecutive goalless defeat at the hands of the Dons. The first half ended goalless, with goalkeepers David Martin and Kelvin Davis impressing with saves from Rickie Lambert and Lewis Guy respectively, but two goals in the last 20 minutes from Angelo Balanta and Peter Leven left the visitors in the relegation zone with their game in hand played. The club's disappointing run of results continued on 18 September with a goalless draw against Colchester United, leaving them in the relegation zone. The game itself was arguably evenly spread between Southampton and Colchester, with the home side said to be edging ahead in the second half culminating in three consecutive chances for Rickie Lambert in injury time at the end of the game. On 25 September Southampton earned their first win in six games by beating Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough Stadium. Lee Barnard scored his second league goal of the season (and the first under manager Nigel Adkins) to end the club's 510-minute goal drought to help them out of the relegation zone. The game was largely dominant for the Saints, although for short periods of time throughout the game Wednesday looked to be on top of proceedings. Other chances came from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Rickie Lambert, and at the very end of the game goalkeeper Kelvin Davis pulled off a string of impressive saves to hold on to the 1\u20130 for Southampton. In the final game of the month on 28 September, Southampton were unable to build on the previous weekend's win, drawing 1\u20131 at Yeovil Town. Brazilian loan signing Guilherme do Prado, who came on as a substitute for the second half, scored his first goal of the season for the Saints just before the hour mark, only to be cancelled out by an Adam Virgo penalty less than ten minutes later. Guly almost won the game for the visiting side late on in the match, but was denied a second goal by Yeovil's post, leaving both sides to pick up a point from the match."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|7||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Lewis Guy"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|40||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Lewis Guy"]}, {"page": "Keanu Marsh-Brown", "response": ["Marsh-Brown graduated through the Fulham Academy to sign professional forms in summer 2009.
