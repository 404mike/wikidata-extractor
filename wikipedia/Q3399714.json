Against the Dragons, he crossed the line for a try after being played in by Jonathan Davies, but the ball was knocked from his grasp in a try-saving tackle from former Scarlet Matthew Watkins before it could be grounded. It took Fenby until 5 March 2010 to score his first Magners League try, crossing in a 25\u20138 win over Ulster; in the third minute, Joe Ajuwa broke down the right wing, but he was brought down just short of the line. Scrum-half Tavis Knoyle spread the ball wide left to Rhys Priestland, and it was then a matter of putting the ball through the hands to provide Fenby with a simple run-in for the try. He scored again against Edinburgh three weeks later; after playing a part in his team's first try, with 10 minutes left to play, Fenby beat four Edinburgh defenders to claim a losing bonus point for the Scarlets. As a reward for his successful first season with the Scarlets, Fenby was given a new two-year contract with the region on 23 April 2010."]}, {"page": "Samoa at the Rugby World Cup", "response": ["|SH ||20||Tavis Knoyle"]}, {"page": "2010 June rugby union tests", "response": ["| ||20|| Tavis Knoyle"]}, {"page": "2011 Six Nations Championship", "response": ["|SH ||20||Tavis Knoyle || || ", "|SH ||20||Tavis Knoyle"]}, {"page": "2011 June rugby union tests", "response": ["|SH ||20||Tavis Knoyle || || "]}]}}
