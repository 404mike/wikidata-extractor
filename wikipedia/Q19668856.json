On 8 November 2019, Stoney signed a contract extension with Manchester United, keeping her at the club until 2022. During the season, Stoney was a vocal critic of the quality of refereeing within the WSL, calling it \"substandard\" following United's 1\u20130 loss to Chelsea on 17 November 2019. Stoney's United, again, drew considerable media attention in February 2020 following a controversial phantom handball penalty decision against Katie Zelem in United's 1\u20131 draw with Reading.
