However, in the 1927\u201328 season, Minter's first season as manager, Spurs was relegated to the Second Division. Although the season started well with Spurs, a series of bad results saw the club dropping down the table. That Spurs was relegated that season was unfortunate as the club had 38 points, a record number of points for a relegated club at a time when it was only 2 points gained for a win, and the clubs in the First Division were tightly packed with only 6 points separating 4th place Derby and relegated Spurs. One crucial reason, however, may be Minter's decision to sell Jimmy Seed to Sheffield Wednesday, whose place in the team was taken by the younger Taffy O'Callaghan. Wednesday were struggling at the bottom of Division One, but Seed not only helped Wednesday escape relegation (beating Tottenham twice in the process), furthermore he led them to the League Championship the next two years."]}, {"page": "Bill Whatley", "response": ["Bill Whatley joined Tottenham Hotspur from Ebbw Vale as an amateur on 31 December 1929.
