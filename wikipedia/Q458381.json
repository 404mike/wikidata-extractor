Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.", "The Arctic Monkeys were formed in mid-2002 by friends Alex Turner, Matt Helders, and Andy Nicholson. Turner and Helders were neighbours and close friends, and they met Nicholson in secondary school. Turner, who had grown up in a musical household as his father was a music teacher, played guitar in the then-instrumental-only band, with Helders on drums, Nicholson on bass, and a new band member, Jamie Cook as a second guitarist. Initially, Turner was reluctant when it came to being the lead singer. As time passed, Turner became the lead singer and frontman of the band as he had \"a thing for words\", according to Helders. The band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend and played its first gig on 13 June 2003 at The Grapes in Sheffield city centre. After a few performances in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 18 songs were demoed in all and the collection, now known as Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned onto CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this title. The group did not mind the distribution, saying \"we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway \u2013 that was a better way for people to hear them.\"", "After a brief hiatus during which Turner toured and recorded with his side project the Last Shadow Puppets, the band recorded half the album at Rancho De La Luna recording sessions with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age in early autumn, 2008, and half in the New York sessions with James Ford in spring, 2009, following their January tour of New Zealand and Australia. During this tour, lead single \"Crying Lightning\", along with Humbug songs \"Pretty Visitors\", \"Dangerous Animals\", and \"Potion Approaching\" (then known as \"Go-Kart\"), was debuted live. It was later revealed by Matt Helders in a video diary that the album would consist of 14 tracks and that Turner would stay in New York to oversee the mixing of the material. However, the final track listing, revealed on 1 June 2009, listed only 10.", "The album was recorded in Sound City Studios in Los Angeles in 2010 and 2011. On 4 March 2011, the band premi\u00e8red on its website a new track called \"Brick by Brick\" with lead vocals by Matt Helders. Helders explained that this is not a single, just a tease of what is coming and that is it is going to be on the fourth album. On 10 March 2011 the band revealed the album is to be called Suck It and See and was released on 6 June 2011.", "The band announced \"The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala\" as the second single to be taken from Suck It and See.

In comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album has been described as \"very, very fast and very, very loud\", being seen as \"more ambitious, heavier...and with a fiercely bright production\". Reflecting the band's travels around the world more than local stories of the first record, FWN is a \"faster, meaner\" album.  The album arguably has influences from The Smiths \u2013 \"twanging, quasi-ambient backdrops...and Turner's voice [...] crooning like Morrissey or Richard Hawley.\" Matt Helders said \"James was DJing loads in the evening so we'd go out and [...] have a dance.\" As a result, the drum rhythms of Helders and bassist Nick O'Malley have drawn comparisons to the Eighties funk band ESG. The band's love of classic films also influenced their new style.

Their progression was also highlighted with The Guardian saying \"if you removed everything from the album except Matt Helders' drumming, it would still be a pretty gripping listen\", and The Observer praising the new sounds on the album referencing the \"piercing, melodic guitar by Jamie Cook\" and \"where Turner reveals the other weapons in his armoury\" when referring to Alex Turner's progression. Pitchfork Media noticed the \"new emotional depth\" of tracks such as \"Do Me a Favour\", \"Only Ones Who Know\" and \"505\", which were also commonly cited by most other critics as being amongst the highlights.
