After leaving school, he worked for Shell and did his national service in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, working in personnel selection. In 1951, he joined the City of London Police as a Constable. Rising to Chief Inspector and attending Bramshill Police College, he transferred to Kent County Constabulary as a Superintendent in 1966. He was promoted Chief Superintendent in 1968 and Assistant Chief Constable in 1969. In the same year, he became the first police officer to attend the Joint Services Staff College.\nIn 1973, he transferred to the Metropolitan Police as Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Traffic Planning). In 1975, he became DAC (Personnel), in 1978 he took over No.2 Area, and in 1979 he became DAC (Operations). In this post, Dellow commanded the police operation in the Iranian Embassy Siege in 1980. Later that year he was appointed DAC (Inspectorate). He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours.On 10 May 1982, he was appointed Assistant Commissioner \"B\" (Traffic). In 1982, he headed the review of Buckingham Palace security after an intruder, Michael Fagan, managed to get into the Queen's bedroom. In March 1984 he was transferred as Assistant Commissioner \"C\" (Crime). The reorganisation in 1985 meant he was the last officer to hold the post of Assistant Commissioner \"C\" and the first to hold the new post of Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations (ACSO). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1985. In 1987, he was promoted to Deputy Commissioner, holding the post until his retirement in 1991. He was vice-president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) from 1988 to 1989 and president from 1989 to 1990. He was knighted in the 1990 Birthday Honours.Dellow was portrayed by Martin Shaw in the 2017 film about the embassy siege, 6 Days.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Iranian Embassy siege", "response": ["Police arrived at the embassy almost immediately after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Dellow arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation.Firmin & Pearson p. 27. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the Royal School of Needlework further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school.Firmin & Pearson, pp. 31\u201332. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of D11, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, and officers with specialist surveillance equipment.Fremont-Barnes, pp. 21\u201322.Siege!, p. 32. Police negotiators, led by Max Vernon, made contact with Oan via a field telephone passed through one of the embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist.Siege!, p. 32. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA's first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Kh\u016bzest\u0101n, and threatened to blow up the embassy and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.Siege!, p. 32.", "During the day, the Foreign Office held further talks with diplomats from Arabian countries in the hope of persuading them to go to the embassy and talk to the hostage-takers. The talks, hosted by Douglas Hurd, ended in stalemate. The diplomats insisted they must be able to offer safe passage out of the UK for the gunmen, believing this to be the only way to guarantee a peaceful outcome, but the British government was adamant that safe passage would not be considered under any circumstances.Siege!, pp. 72\u201374. Karkouti, through whom Oan had issued his revised demands the previous day, became increasingly ill throughout the day and by the evening was feverish, which led to suggestions that the police had spiked the food that had been sent into the embassy. John Dellow, the commander of the police operation, had apparently considered the idea and even consulted a doctor about its viability, but eventually dismissed it as \"impracticable\".Fremont-Barnes, p. 28.", "After Lavasani's body had been recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, contacted the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power.McNee, p. 161. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, and the prime minister agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed over control of the operation to Lieutenant-Colonel Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. The signed note is now on display at New Scotland Yard's Crime Museum. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.Fremont-Barnes, pp. 32\u201333.Gould & Waldren, p. 180."]}, {"page": "Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis", "response": ["*John Dellow, 1982\u20131984", "*John Dellow, 1984\u20131985", "*John Dellow, 1985\u20131987"]}, {"page": "Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis", "response": ["*Sir John Dellow, 1987\u20131991"]}, {"page": "William Ellis School", "response": ["* Sir John Dellow CBE, Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1987\u201391"]}, {"page": "John Albert Dellow", "response": ["#RedirectJohn Dellow"]}, {"page": "Dellow (surname)", "response": ["*John Dellow (born 1931), British police officer"]}, {"page": "6 Days (2017 film)", "response": ["* Martin Shaw \u2013 John Dellow"]}, {"page": "Dellow, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Dellow"]}]}}
