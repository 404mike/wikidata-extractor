An opening bowler, he played several matches for Oxford University in 1962 without establishing himself in the team.\nHe had one outstanding performance, in May 1963, when Oxford played the touring West Indians at The Parks. In damp conditions, the West Indians dismissed Oxford for 119, but then Mountford was able to exploit the conditions and, swinging the ball away from the bat, took 7 for 47 to dismiss the West Indians for 107. He maintained his place for the rest of the season. His last first-class match was against Cambridge University that year, when he dismissed Mike Brearley twice, for 3 and 0.Mountford played for the second elevens of Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Hampshire between 1962 and 1969 without playing first-eleven cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Mountford", "response": ["Peter Mountford may refer to:", "*Peter Mountford (footballer) (born 1960), English footballer", "*Peter Mountford (author) (born 1976), American novelist and writer", "*Peter Mountford (cricketer) (born 1940), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Mountford", "response": ["*Peter Mountford (author) (born 1976), American novelist and writer of short stories and non-fiction", "*Peter Mountford (cricketer) (born 1940), English cricketer", "*Peter Mountford (footballer) (born 1960), English footballer"]}]}}
