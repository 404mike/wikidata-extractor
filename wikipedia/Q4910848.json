Shepherd signed for Liverpool from Elm Park in 1948. He was a regular in the starting lineup during his first season at the club as he made 41 appearances during the 1948\u201349 season. However, during his next three seasons at the club he was only a bit-part player, making only 13 appearances before he left in 1952. He joined Lancashire Combination side Wigan Athletic, where he made 11 appearances during his one season at the club. Bill finished his career as player manager at Runcorn Town where he infamously took his team off the pitch in a game against Witton Albion when he categorically stated that the ball had entered the goal through a hole in the net. Bill is survived by his son Graham, who works in the Aerospace industry and is also a semi-professional musician.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Shepherd (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bill Shepherd (American football) (1911\u20131967), American football player", "*Bill Shepherd (English footballer) (1920\u20131983), English footballer for Liverpool F.C.", "*Bill Shepherd (politician), chairman of the Northland Regional Council, New Zealand"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Bill Shepherd"]}, {"page": "1951\u201352 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Bill Shepherd"]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Bill Shepherd"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Bill Shepherd"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Bill Shepherd"]}]}}
