He printed the Journals of the House of Commons from 1774 until his death. His son Thomas Curson Hansard took over the business, and added the name \"Hansard\" to the title of the official reports of parliamentary debates and proceedings in 1829. This led to such reports in the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries being customarily known as Hansard.", "link_mentions": {}}}
