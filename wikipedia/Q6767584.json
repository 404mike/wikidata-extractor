Feltham is a long-term member of the British rhythm and blues band Nine Below Zero, and Rory Gallagher's band; and is often used as a session musician.\nIn an interview on the South Bank Show broadcast in 1981, Nine Below Zero guitarist and singer Dennis Greaves noted that Feltham's 'nan' had played the harmonica and his dad bought him his first instrument. Greaves also stated that Feltham had been playing in his bedroom for 11 years, but had given the instrument up for a time before joining Nine Below Zero, his first band.  In addition, when he joined he did not know how to play through a microphone or what an amplifier was. Greaves also noted that Feltham studied the music of Little Walter, Charlie McCoy and Junior Wells.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The The", "response": ["* Mark Feltham\u00a0\u2013 harmonica on Mind Bomb (1989): Kingdom of Rain / Good Morning Beautiful / The Beat(en) Generation / The Violence of Truth"]}, {"page": "Mind Bomb", "response": ["* Mark Feltham \u2013 harmonica"]}, {"page": "Talk Talk", "response": ["Talk Talk abandoned the synthpop style completely with their third album, 1986's The Colour of Spring.

Another single, \"Living in Another World\", charted in the Top 40 in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and Italy (and just outside the Top 40 in the UK and France). By this time, all Talk Talk songs were being written by Hollis and Friese-Greene. The extended line-up for the 1986 tour consisted of Hollis, Webb and Harris, plus John Turnbull (guitars), Rupert Black and Ian Curnow (keyboards), Phil Reis and Leroy Williams (percussion), and Mark Feltham (harmonica).
