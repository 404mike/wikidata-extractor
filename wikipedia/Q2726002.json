The accepted process of pearl culture was developed by the British Biologist William Saville-Kent in Australia and brought to Japan by Tokichi Nishikawa and Tatsuhei Mise. Nishikawa was granted the patent in 1916, and married the daughter of Mikimoto. Mikimoto was able to use Nishikawa's technology. After the patent was granted in 1916, the technology was immediately commercially applied to akoya pearl oysters in Japan in 1916. Mise's brother was the first to produce a commercial crop of pearls in the akoya oyster. Mitsubishi's Baron Iwasaki immediately applied the technology to the south sea pearl oyster in 1917 in the Philippines, and later in Buton, and Palau. Mitsubishi was the first to produce a cultured south sea pearl\u00a0\u2013 although it was not until 1928 that the first small commercial crop of pearls was successfully produced."]}, {"page": "Mikimoto K\u014dkichi", "response": ["Mikimoto did not know that government biologist Tokichi Nishikawa and a carpenter, Tatsuhei Mise, had each spent time in Australia and learned the secret to spherical pearl production from expatriate British marine biologist William Saville-Kent \u2013 inserting a piece of oyster epithelial membrane (the lip of mantle tissue) with a nucleus of shell or metal into an oyster's body or mantle causes the tissue to form a pearl sack. The sack produces nacre, which coats the nucleus, thus creating a pearl. Mise received a 1907 patent for this grafting needle. When Nishikawa applied in the same year, he realized that Mise had already secured a patent. In a compromise, the pair agreed to cooperate, calling their discovery the \"Mise-Nishikawa method\"."]}, {"page": "List of inventors", "response": ["*William Saville-Kent (1845\u20131908), UK/Australia \u2013 Pearl culture, see also Mikimoto K\u014dkichi"]}, {"page": "Scleropages jardinii", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Saville-Kent"]}, {"page": "Royal School of Mines", "response": ["* William Saville-Kent, marine biologist and author"]}, {"page": "Alice Pruvot-Fol", "response": ["She was the author of many new species, mostly described on the basis of  preserved animals.
