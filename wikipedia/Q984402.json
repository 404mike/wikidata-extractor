Thomson's pseudonym derives from the names of the poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Novalis. He is often distinguished from the earlier Scottish poet James Thomson by the letters B.V. after his name.Thomson's poems rarely appear in modern anthologies, although the autobiographical \"Insomnia\" and \"Mater Tenebrarum\" are well-regarded and contain some striking passages. He admired and translated the works of the pessimistic Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi (1798\u20131837), but his pessimism is considered to have been stronger than that of Leopardi. He is regarded as one of the bleakest Victorian poets, being described as \"The Laureate of Pessimism\" since 1882, the year of his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*James Thomson (1700\u20131748, S)", "*James Thomson (awa Bysshe Vanolis, 1834\u20131882, S)"]}, {"page": "Pessimism", "response": ["Philosophical pessimism has often been tied to the arts and literature. Schopenhauer's philosophy was very popular with composers (Wagner, Brahms and Mahler)., The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) While there are earlier examples of literary pessimism, such as in the work of Miguel de Cervantes, several philosophical pessimists also wrote novels or poetry (Camus and Leopardi respectively). A distinctive literary form which has been associated with pessimism is aphoristic writing, and this can be seen in Leopardi, Nietzsche and Cioran. Nineteenth and twentieth-century writers who could be said to express pessimistic views in their works or to be influenced by pessimistic philosophers include Charles Baudelaire, Samuel Beckett, Gottfried Benn, Jorge Luis Borges, Charles Bukowski, Dino Buzzati, Lord Byron, Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, Joseph Conrad, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mihai Eminescu, Sigmund Freud, Thomas Hardy, Sadegh Hedayat, H.
