He was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1910 and died in London in 1986.\nRosenfeld made seminal contributions to Kleinian thinking on psychotic and other very ill patients; while his emphasis on the role of the analyst in contributing to potential impasses in the analytic encounter has had a wide impact on analysts both in Britain and internationally.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wilfred Bion", "response": ["Returning to the Tavistock Clinic Bion chaired the Planning Committee that reorganized the Tavistock into the new Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, alongside a new Tavistock Clinic which was part of the newly launched National Health Service. As his interest in psychoanalysis increased, he underwent training analysis, between 1946 and 1952, with Melanie Klein. He met his second wife, Francesca, at the Tavistock in 1951. He joined a research group of Klein's students (including Hanna Segal and Herbert Rosenfeld), who were developing Klein's theory of the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions, for use in the analysis of patients with psychotic disorders. He produced a series of highly original and influential papers (collected as \"Second Thoughts\", 1967) on the analysis of schizophrenia, and the specifically cognitive, perceptual, and identity problems of such patients. To this he added a valuable final section called Commentary, showing how some of his views on clinical and theoretical matters had changed.", "Wilfred Bion was a potent and original contributor to psychoanalysis. He was one of the first to analyse patients in psychotic states using an unmodified analytic technique; he extended existing theories of projective processes and developed new conceptual tools. The degree of collaboration between Hanna Segal, Wilfred Bion and Herbert Rosenfeld in their work with psychotic patients during the late 1950s, and their discussions with Melanie Klein at the time, means that it is not always possible to distinguish their exact individual contributions to the developing theory of splitting, projective identification, unconscious phantasy and the use of countertransference. As Donald Meltzer (1979, 1981), Denis Carpy (1989, p.\u00a0287), and Michael Feldman (2009, pp.\u00a033, 42) have pointed out, these three pioneering analysts not only sustained Klein's clinical and theoretical approach, but through an extension of the concept of projective identification and countertransference they deepened and expanded it. In Bion's clinical work and supervision the goal remains insightful understanding of psychic reality through a disciplined experiencing of the transference\u2013countertransference, in a way that promotes the growth of the whole personality."]}, {"page": "Melanie Klein", "response": ["* Herbert Rosenfeld (Information in French): * \"Impasse and Interpretation: Therapeutic and Anti-Therapeutic Factors in the Psycho-Analytic Treatment of Psychotic, Borderline, and Neurotic Patients\", Publisher: Tavistock Publications, 1987, "]}, {"page": "Malignant narcissism", "response": ["The social psychologist Erich Fromm first coined the term \"malignant narcissism\" in 1964, describing it as a \"severe mental sickness\" representing \"the quintessence of evil\".
