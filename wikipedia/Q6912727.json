One objection by Morna Hooker (1971) is that the criterion requires full knowledge of 1st-century Jewish and Christian beliefs, which scholars do not have, and therefore it is difficult to compare them with the traditions of Jesus for this criterion to work. Oegema (2012) pointed out that increasing knowledge poses a new issue: \"The problem of the Criterion of Double Dissimilarity is that the more we know about early Jewish traditions and the more we know about early Christian post-Easter traditions, the less space there is for a reconstruction of the authentic sayings of Jesus, as by definition they have to differ from early Jewish and early Christian traditions. Therefore, in the end, no trace of a historical Jesus remains.\"Oegema, Gerbern S. Apocalyptic Interpretation of the Bible. 2012. pg. 79.

His initial focus was on the religions of India. To matriculate, Bennett spent his first year obtaining a Certificate in Biblical Knowledge from the University and two 'A levels' (in Religious Studies and British Constitution and Politics) from the Joint Matriculation Board (JMB). At University Bennett was politically active through the Liberal Society. He was Treasurer of the Baptist-United Reformed Church Society, served on the Chaplaincy committee and as Secretary of the Theological Society. In this capacity, he invited such theologians as Maurice Wiles, I. Howard Marshall, Morna Hooker and others to address the Society, whose members included Faculty alongside students. For the last six months of his final year he was Baptist Student Leader at the College (where Methodists were also training for ministry). He graduated in July 1978 and was ordained as a minister of the Baptist Union of Great Britain the same month. Accepted for service with the Baptist Missionary Society, Bennett spent an academic year at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham where he undertook missionary orientation.  He was most influenced by Lesslie Newbigin, who taught missiology.Bennett was to work with Newbigin on various committees of the Birmingham Council of Christian Churches between 1983 and 1992.  Newbigin was a Vice-President. In July 1979, Bennett obtained a Certificate in the Study of Islam from the University of Birmingham through the Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations before proceeding to Bangladesh, where he remained until 1982 engaged in pastoral care and distance education teaching as a tutor for the College of Christian Theology Bangladesh (CCTB).  He passed the Junior and Senior level Bengali examinations of the Bangladesh Language Examination Board.  Although he completed several units of a master's degree by distance learning from Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, CA he was unable to complete the residential component because of the cost. When the BMS chose not to support his plan to enroll for an MA at a College in Bangladesh, he returned to Birmingham, graduating MA in 1985 and PhD in 1990. Both research degrees were in Islamic Studies under the supervision of David Kerr and Christian W. Troll, SJ. His external examiners were Jan Slomp and Clifford Edmund Bosworth.  Bennett's doctoral thesis was subsequently published as Victorian Images of Islam (1992) (in the CSIC Studies on Islam and Christianity series). In 1985, Bennett also passed the Bengali 'O Level' (London) achieving an 'A' grade. In 1996, Bennett graduated from the University of Oxford with the MEd through Westminster College, Oxford where he was teaching at the time. In 1994 he had completed the Certificate of Professional Studies in Education from the University's Delegacy of Local Examinations also through Westminster.This information is taken from Contemporary Authors, Vol. 157-page 20 and from Bennett's from Clinton Bennett's Curriculum Vitae at Biodata."]}, {"page": "The Journal of Theological Studies", "response": ["Previous editors have included the patristic scholars James Bethune-Baker (1904\u201335), Henry Chadwick (1954\u201385), and Maurice Wiles (1986\u201399), and the biblical scholars R.
