He spent the next part of his life in Japan and became one of the major naturalists in that country. Blakiston was the first person to notice that animals in Hokkaid\u014d, Japan's northern island, were related to northern Asian species, whereas those on Honsh\u016b to the south were related to those from southern Asia. The Tsugaru Strait between the two islands was therefore established as a zoogeographical boundary, and became known as \"Blakiston's Line\".

Her great-grandfather, John Haviland, was a Professor of Anatomy and the first Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Cambridge to give regular courses in pathology and medicine. She spent her youth growing on the estate of her step-father in south-east Ireland where she shot and observed birds in the wild. She learned anatomy and dissection from books and began to write books. Her earliest was Wild life on the Wing (1913) and wrote some books meant for children. In 1914 she joined Polish anthropologist Maria Czaplicka on an expedition to Siberia along the Yenesei. Other members of the group included painter Dora Curtis  and Henry Usher Hall of the Philadelphia University Museum. They travelled overland to Krasnoyarsk, took the trans-Siberian rail and went down the Yenesei in a steamer. On the route she was able to observe several are waders and their nests. They returned by the Kara Sea. Returning from the trip she wrote her most popular work, A Summer on the Yenesei. Her work was inspired by  Henry Seebohm (1832\u20131895) and his journey in 1877 which was published in Siberia in Asia as well as Notes of birds observed on the Yenesei River, Siberia (1895) by H.L.

Murray  In 1917 she worked with the  Scottish Women's Hospital for Foreign Service driving Dr. Elsie Inglis in Romania. In 1918 she worked as a chauffeur for the French Red Cross in the Soissons-Paris region. After the war she joined Newnham College, Cambridge to study zoology. Her main interest was in insects. From 1919 to 1922 she continued to research insects and one of her works was in the examination of factors causing the production of winged morphs in aphids. She noted in an experiment that plants that did not receive magnesium could induce the production of winged forms. She married Harold Hulme Brindley, a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge in 1922 and spent the next year in British Guiana examining bugs. She published on insects and also wrote a paper on river craft in British Guiana. On returning she gave lectures on various Arctic habitats. She was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union in 1916 and was a member of the Cambridge Bird Club. She was also member of the American Ornithologists' Union. She died in Cambridge.

Since its first description, and placement in the genus Bubo, it has repeatedly been placed in Ketupa; the 2013 phylogenetic analysis of nine horned owl species indicate that four Ketupa species including Blakiston's fish owl form a monophyletic group, and genetic testing of Blakiston's fish owl in Russia published in 2018 indicates a fairly large divergence from the genomes of typical Bubo."]}, {"page": "St Kilda wren", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Henry Seebohm"]}, {"page": "Richard J.
