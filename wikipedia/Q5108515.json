He is a practitioner of traditional English dance music (with a background in English church music), including Morris and other rituals and ceremonies, but his repertoire also includes much French folk music and traditional Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois material. He worked for many years in a duo with button accordion/melodeon player Andy Cutting: Wood & Cutting were one of the most influential acts on the English folk music scene. Q Magazine gave their \"Live at Sidmouth\" album four stars and put the duo \"at the forefront of the latest wave of British music acts\". One of his first recordings was playing bass and percussion on \"Jack's Alive\" (1980) the first album by the Oysterband (at that time called the Oyster Ceilidh Band).\nWood is also a member of Wood, Wilson & Carthy, with Roger Wilson and Martin Carthy. Wood & Cutting, together with piano accordionist Karen Tweed and guitarist Ian Carr, make up the Two Duos Quartet, who have made one album \"Half as happy as we\". With John Dipper on fiddle and Robert Harbron on concertinas, he is part of the English Acoustic Collective. This is also the name of an organisation which Wood set up in 1999 to link the many threads of his teaching activities, including summer schools based at Ruskin Mill near Nailsworth, Gloucestershire.\nOther projects include \"Listening to the River\" (a concert project which interweaves recordings of dialect and oral history from the area around the River Medway with live music) and \"Glassblower\", described as \"an industrial ballet\".\nAt the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2006, the Best Original Song category was won by Wood and storyteller Hugh Lupton for \"One in a Million\", a modern retelling of a widespread traditional tale in which a lost ring is rediscovered in the stomach of a fish. He was also nominated in three other categories: Best Album (for The Lark Descending), Best Traditional Track (\"Lord Bateman\"), and Folk Singer of the Year.\nIn 2009, the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards recognised Wood as 'Folk Singer of the Year', and Trespasser was also recognised as Album of the Year.\nIn March 2009, Wood took part in the Darwin Song Project, a multi-artist songwriting retreat organised by the Shrewsbury Folk Festival to create songs that had a \"resonance and relevance\" to Darwin.  A CD was released in August 2009.\nIn 2011, Wood again tasted success at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, where he was recognised as Folk Singer of the Year as well as winning Song of the Year for his song \"Hollow Point\", from The Handmade Life, a song about the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005.In 2012, the singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading asked him to appear as support act on the British leg of her Starlight tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Chris Wood"]}, {"page": "John Barleycorn", "response": ["Many versions of the song have been recorded, including a popular version by the rock group Traffic, appearing on their 1970 album John Barleycorn Must Die.

The song is also a central part of Simon Emmerson's The Imagined Village project. Martin and Eliza Carthy perform the song alongside Paul Weller on the Imagined Village album. Billy Bragg sang in Weller's place on live performances. Rock guitarist Joe Walsh performed the song live in 2007 as a tribute to Jim Capaldi. Lithuanian folk-blues band Working Hobo performs this song in Lithuanian which is called D\u017eonas Mie\u017eis.

It had retained a strong tradition of wassailing, and seafaring songs were important in the coastal counties of Kent and Hampshire. Arguably the published collection of oral material was made in this area by John Broadwood, as Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex (1843).J. Broadwood, Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex, and Collected by One Who Has Learnt Them by Hearing Them Sung Every Christmas from Early Childhood, by the Country People, Who Go About to the Neighbouring Houses, Singing, or 'Wassailing' as It Is Called, at that Season. The Airs Are Set to Music Exactly as They Are Now Sung, to Rescue Them from Oblivion, and to Afford a Specimen of Genuine Old English Melody: and the Words Are Given in Their Original Rough State, with an Occasional Slight Alteration To Render the Sense Intelligible (London, 1843). When the first revival was at its height in the first decade of the 20th century, George Gardiner and Alice Gillington both collected songs in Hampshire, Lucy Broadwood in Surrey, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, Alfred Williams in Oxfordshire and Berkshire and Cecil Sharp in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Kent.G. B. Gardiner, Folk Songs from Hampshire (London: Novello, 1909) and A. E. Gillington, Eight Hampshire Folk Songs Taken from the Mouths of the Peasantry (London: Curwen, 1907); A. Williams, Folk songs of the Upper Thames (London, 1923) and C. Sharp, Cecil Sharp\u2019s Collection of English Folk Song, ed., Maud Karpeles, 2 vols (London: Oxford University Press, 1974). In the second folk revival the region contributed several figures, with probably the most important being Martin Carthy from Hertfordshire. The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the Oyster Band, formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. From the current crop of young folk musicians probably the most prominent are Spiers and Boden from Oxfordshire and Chris Wood, born in Kent. The region is host to numerous folk clubs, and festivals, including the Oxford festival and Fairport's Cropredy Convention in Oxfordshire and St Albans in Hertfordshire."]}, {"page": "Joan Armatrading", "response": ["Armatrading has always supported new music and local talent.
