In the 1950s he was a pioneer of geocoding statistical primary data. He developed models and statistical techniques, such as the time\u2013space cube and time\u2013space prism, which later became important in the development of geographic information systems that process and visualize movement data.For example: ; ; ; ; ; ;  His work informed the likes of Allan Pred and Nigel Thrift, who helped take it to the English speaking world.; ; ", "Development of H\u00e4gerstrand's work has continued to form part of the basis for non-representational theory, and a reappraisal of his work by new generations of social scientistsFor example: ; ; ; ; ;  and biologistsFor example: ; ;  means that he remains an influential thinker today. In 2005, Nigel Thrift summarized five benefits of H\u00e4gerstrand's time geography for contemporary social science: First, it provides a sense of concreteness, of the power of 'thereness', and it does so in a way\u2014visually\u2014that is still the preserve of too few social theorists. All those intricate diagrams were, in part, an attempt to describe the pragmatics of events, a theme which has now, in the work of writers like Deleuze, become fashionable in the social sciences and humanities but, at the time at which H\u00e4gerstrand was working, tended to be restricted to the field of philosophy, except for the work of social interactionists and ethnomethodologists which was often very imperfectly understood by other than a relatively small coterie of enthusiasts. Secondly, H\u00e4gerstrand's work was an attack on the Durkheimian idea that space and time were social categories, collective representations which both derived from society and also dictated to society. [...] Time-geography makes it possible to go beyond social constructionism by emphasizing the physical constraints on human action and the wider networks of competing opportunities that they set up which act to steer situations. [...] Thirdly, and as a directly related point, those time-geographic diagrams did something else too. They radically lessened the distinction between humans and other objects. They provided a kind of neutrality of representation, even a democracy of description, of the world. [...] Fourthly, H\u00e4gerstrand's work espoused a geographical ethics, centred on the wise use of space and time. Although H\u00e4gerstrand would often use economic metaphors to describe that wisdom in the use of space and time, I am sure that he meant something broader and more encompassing which it seems to me to be well worth keeping hold of, a kind of democratic ethos of the cardinal dimensions, a conviviality in the use of space and time. Fifthly, H\u00e4gerstrand provided a language which could register the world in different ways. Perhaps one way of looking at H\u00e4gerstrand's work is as a means of saying 'hello' in a language many can understand: drawing as a kind of visual Esperanto."]}, {"page": "Nailsea School", "response": ["*Professor Sir Nigel Thrift PhD DSc FBA, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Warwick and distinguished geographer."]}, {"page": "N.
