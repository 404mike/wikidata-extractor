After leaving school he worked initially as a coalminer, before attending St. Mungo's Medical School to study dentistry. He qualified in 1929, and was admitted to the Royal Faculty Physicians and Surgeons. In 1933 he married Agnes Kerr of Castle Douglas, and the couple had 2 children.\nIn 1928 Baird become active in Labour politics in Glasgow. He continued to be a member of the Labour Party when he moved his dental practice firstly to the north of England and then later to the London area.  With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Baird joined the Army Dental Corps, reaching the rank of captain by the war's end.He was first elected to the House of Commons in the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election, when he defeated the long-serving Liberal MP, Geoffrey Mander.\nWhen his constituency was abolished for the 1950 general election, Baird was returned to Parliament for the new Wolverhampton North East.  He held that seat until he stepped down at the 1964 general election.\nIn parliament he took an interest in health and social insurance issues. He was a strong opponent of racism, and also sought to form better relations with Communist countries, visiting the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China on a number of occasions.According to John Callaghan, Baird should be \"counted as the first Trotskyist MP\" for assistance he gave to the second Revolutionary Socialist League, later better known as Militant.  Pierre Frank commented that he \"was always on our side.\"Baird died in a London hospital in 1965, aged 58.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Baird", "response": ["John Baird may refer to:", "*John Baird (American football), All-American football player", "*John Baird (Australian footballer) (born 1980), Australian rules footballer", "*John Baird (cyclist), former racing cyclist from New Zealand", "*John Baird (footballer, born 1870) (1870\u20131905), Scottish footballer", "*John Baird (footballer, born 1985), Scottish footballer playing for Forfar Athletic", "*John Baird, Lord Newbyth (1620\u20131698), Scottish advocate, judge, politician and diplomat", "*John Baird (Canadian politician) (born 1969), Canadian politician and former cabinet minister", "*John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven (1874\u20131941), eighth Governor-General of Australia", "*John Baird (Michigan politician) (1859\u20131934), Michigan State Representative and Senator", "*Sir John Baird, 2nd Baronet (1686\u20131745), Scottish Member of Parliament for Edinburghshire", "*John Baird (North West Lanarkshire MP) (1852\u20131900), Member of Parliament, 1885\u20131886", "*John Baird (Wolverhampton MP) (1906\u20131965), British Labour Party Member of Parliament, 1945\u20131964", "*John Baird (revolutionary) (1790\u20131820), Scottish commander in the \"Radical War\" of 1820", "*John Baird (Royal Navy officer) (1832\u20131908), Victorian British Admiral", "*John Baird (educator) (1795\u20131858), Irish-born British Army instructor", "*John Baird (RAF officer) (born 1937), British physician and retired Royal Air Force medical officer", "*John Baird (Irish divine) (died 1804)", "*John Baird (Scottish divine) (1799\u20131861)", "*John Baird, founder of the Create a Comic Project", "*John Baird I (1798\u20131859), Glasgow architect"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Baird"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Baird"]}, {"page": "Dewey Commission", "response": ["Some ten years later, the Dewey Commission was cited in great detail, when in an open letter to the British press dated 25 February 1946, written by George Orwell and signed by Arthur Koestler, C.
