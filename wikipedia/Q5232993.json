Originally from Belfast, he later moved to England, where he studied at Oxford University on biochemistry specialty and worked as a research scientist.Doak began his video game career working with Rare where he provided network support for Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! and helped develop the critically acclaimed GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark for the Nintendo 64. His facial likeness and name were used for a non-player character in GoldenEye 007, a scientist named Dr. Doak. Several of the guards also bear his likeness.Doak and video game composer Graeme Norgate left Rare in 1998 to start Free Radical Design. From there he worked on the video game series TimeSplitters and two other video games called Haze and Second Sight.Doak left Free Radical - now known as Deep Silver Dambuster Studios - in 2009 and set up his own Nottingham-based studio, Zinkyzonk, which would develop games for Facebook. The company evolved from his defunct studio Pumpkin Beach. Zinkyzonk released its first game, Gangsta Zombies, on 11 July 2010 in partnership with Jolt Online Gaming.  The company was dissolved in April 2013.Since 2016, Doak lectures at Norwich University of the Arts.On 19 May 2021, Deep Silver announced the reformation of Free Radical Design with David Doak and Steve Ellis as studio heads to make a new TimeSplitters game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 11", "response": ["*  1967   \u2013 David Doak, Northern Irish video game designer"]}, {"page": "List of Irish people", "response": ["* David Doak (born 1967) \u2013 scientist, video game developer and entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)", "response": ["After the first year of development, Rare added more staff to the project. The first addition was designer David Doak, who helped with the level designs and worked on the game's AI scripting. He explained how the game's stealth elements were implemented: \"Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within a certain amount of time, it did a larger radius test and I think there was a third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset.\" Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to spy on enemies."]}, {"page": "Perfect Dark", "response": ["The game's science fiction setting was chosen due to the developers' interest in the genre. The X-Files television series inspired the incorporation of a gray alien character and the premise of aliens being investigated. Other influences on the setting, theme and plot included conspiracy theories and works such as the Ghost in the Shell manga, Elektra comic books, the films Blade Runner and Judge Dredd, and the writing of author Philip K. Dick. Hollis and designer David Doak picked architectural and impressive sci-fi dystopian settings; the plot was then constructed around these locations. For example, the first level takes place in a skyscraper that lead artist Karl Hilton had always wanted to build, and features realistic environments like service stairs and an exterior area that can be explored. Although the game features a new fictional universe, it was still envisioned as a spy shooter like GoldenEye\u00a0007. The developers' desires to expand upon its stealth mechanics, along with their admiration for the 1998 stealth game Metal Gear Solid, led to the creation of gadgets such as the CamSpy and the data uplink device."]}, {"page": "Rare (company)", "response": ["Around 1997, a number of Rare employees left to establish separate companies. The first was Eighth Wonder, underwritten by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which did not produce any games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios. In May 2021, Deep Silver reestablished Free Radical Design with original founding members Steve Ellis and David Doak heading up the new studio."]}, {"page": "TimeSplitters 2", "response": ["In February 1999, 15 months before the release of Perfect Dark, several members of Rare that were part of the GoldenEye 007 development team, including Steve Ellis, Karl Hilton, Graeme Norgate, and David Doak, left to form their own company called Free Radical Design. After they developed the first TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2 went into development, trying to create a more fulfilling story mode alongside the Arcade and MapMaker modes.  The game was developed over a 23-month period, with around half of that time devoted to creating the opening level."]}, {"page": "TimeSplitters", "response": ["In June 2007, the Official UK PlayStation Magazine called out a rumour that another installment of the TimeSplitters series was in development by Free Radical as an exclusive for the PlayStation 3. In the following August, Rob Yescombe, scriptwriter for the series' previous title, confirmed that \"TimeSplitters 4 is happening,\" but stated that the game was \"in the very early concept stages, and as yet it's unsigned to any publisher.\" Despite the previously rumoured PS3 exclusivity, Yescombe stated that no specific release platforms had been established. \"I'm sure it's possible to do a control scheme that works,\" co-creator David Doak added, when asked about his thoughts on developing a first-person shooter for the Nintendo Wii. Of the game's timeline, Yescombe stated that \"the game's not a very long way away but it's not a very short way away either. It's somewhere in the middle.\"", "In August 2018, Koch Media (a subsidiary of THQ Nordic AB) announced that they had acquired the IP and publishing rights for TimeSplitters, with the intention of publishing future games in the series via their Deep Silver publishing company. In August 2019, THQ Nordic announced in their financial report that Steve Ellis had joined the company to \"help plot the future course for [the TimeSplitters] franchise.\" Ellis then stated that the series' \"time has now come\" and expressed hopes that \"the original team will join hands again.\" Later that month, Dambuster Studios, which includes several former Free Radical staff members, replied to a fan on Twitter, confirming that Ellis had a team \"handling the next TimeSplitters product.\" The series' other creator, David Doak, confirmed in an interview that he \"isn't directly involved with this new interpretation,\" but expressed a desire to see it return as a \"social experience\" (similar to games like Fortnite), rather than a traditional boxed-game product.", "The TimeSplitters games were developed by Free Radical Design, a development company based in the Midlands, UK. Free Radical was founded in 1999 by five people, all of whom had previously worked for Rare on the Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark (for a year and a half of development, but before its release): directors David Doak and Steve Ellis set up the company, and were then followed by director Karl Hilton, soundtrack composer Graeme Norgate, and Lee Ray. As a result of this shared development team, gameplay similarities, and occasionally overlapping settings (such as a Russian dam, as featured in TimeSplitters 2), the TimeSplitters franchise is often compared to these predecessors, and considered to be their \"spiritual successor.\"", "Free Radical made an agreement with Eidos Interactive in February 1999 to \"work for roughly three years on a novel FPS\". Although it was not the first game worked on by the team (the first being an FPS with the working title of Redemption: what would later become Second Sight), TimeSplitters began development after the company received received approval to obtain a PlayStation 2 devkit (which were difficult to obtain) and decided to focus on creating a more straightforward shooter whose pace would suit the new console's power, and which could be developed in time for the PlayStation 2's delayed launch date. The team approached the project with the intent of increasing not just pace, but also the quantity/variety of enemies compared to GoldenEye and Perfect Dark. In the words of David Doak:\"Steve [Ellis, lead programmer] got something up and running really quickly. I think Sony were really impressed; their experience had been that people would take six months, eight months, a year to get anything working at all on PS2. It was down to Steve's technical ability: he had a first-person thing up and running fairly quickly.\"In October 2000, following initial development under the working title of MPG (Multiplayer Game), the completed TimeSplitters became Free Radical's first game release, and was the only PlayStation 2 launch title developed in Europe.", "David Doak described TimeSplitters 2 as \"what we thought the first game should have been ... all the ideas we\u2019d had along the way.\" This included strengthening the single-player mode, which had received criticism for its lack of depth in the multiplayer-focused original. Development for the sequel had begun the very next day after the game was completed in September 2000, and would ultimately include enhancements such as a new animation system and improved special effects."]}]}}
