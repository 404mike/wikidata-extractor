According to Simon Jones' book World War I Gas Warfare Tactics and Equipment, on learning of the sinking of the luxury liner RMS Lusitania in May 1915 with loss of 1,100 lives including, apparently, his wife, he vowed to kill an equal number of Germans. It was to this end that he began experimenting with gas and flame projectors of various types and continued in his work even after hearing that his wife had not, after all, been on board the Lusitania. This account cannot be literally true because Livens did not get married until 1916. Charles Foulkes, who became Livens' commanding officer and who later wrote Gas! The Story of the Special Brigade, mentions \"a strong personal feeling\" connected with the sinking of the Lusitania without being more specific. According to Who's Who in World War One by John Bourne, it was the first use of poison gas by the Germans at the Second Battle of Ypres on 22 April 1915 that prompted Livens' vengeful ambitions. This alternative account is consistent with Livens' later statement that he began his experimental work at the end of April 1915."]}, {"page": "Charles Foulkes (field hockey player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Foulkes (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Charles Howard Foulkes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Foulkes (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Scotland men's national field hockey team", "response": ["* Charles Foulkes"]}, {"page": "David H.
