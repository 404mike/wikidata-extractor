In an 1823 article \"On the deluge\", John Stevens Henslow, professor of mineralogy at the University of Cambridge, affirmed the concept and proposed that the Flood had originated from a comet, but this was his only comment on the topic. Adam Sedgwick, Woodwardian Professor of Geology at Cambridge,  presented two supportive papers in 1825, \"On the origin of alluvial and diluvial deposits\", and \"On diluvial formations\". At this time, most of what Sedgwick called \"The English school of geologists\" distinguished superficial deposits which were \"diluvial\", showing \"great irregular masses of sand, loam, and coarse gravel, containing through its mass rounded blocks sometimes of enormous magnitude\" and supposedly caused by \"some great irregular inundation\", from \"alluvial\" deposits of \"comminuted gravel, silt, loam, and other materials\" attributed to lesser events, the \"propelling force\" of rivers, or \"successive partial inundations\"."]}, {"page": "Oxford University Museum of Natural History", "response": ["On the Wednesday of the meeting, 27 June 1860, botanist Charles Daubeny presented a paper on plant sexuality, which made reference to Darwin's theory of natural selection.

The theory was popularized during the Oxford Movement, particularly through the work of the Tractarians. Although the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission, an organization sponsored by the Anglican Consultative Council and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, seeks to make ecumenical progress between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, it has made no statement on the topic. The theory \"has received mixed reception even within the Anglican Communion.\" The majority of Anglicans, including those of low church, broad church and high churchmanship, have \"followed the major continental Reformers in their doctrine of the true church, identifiable by the authentic ministry of word and sacrament, in their rejection of the jurisdiction of the pope, and in their alliance with the civil authority ('the magistrate')\". The Church of England historically considered itself \"Protestant and Reformed\" and recognized as true churches the Continental Reformed Churches, participating in the Synod of Dort in 1618-1619; in 1567, Edmund Grindal, who became the Church of England's Archbishop of Canterbury, declared that \"all reformed churches do differ in rites and ceremonies, but we agree with all reformed churches in substance of doctrine.\" As such, Anglicans have entered into full communion with bodies such as the Evangelical Church in Germany and in some countries, have merged with Methodist, Presbyterian and Lutheran denominations to form united Protestant Churches, such as the Church of North India, Church of Pakistan, Church of South India, and the Church of Bangladesh for example. For Anglicans of Evangelical churchmanship, the notion of apostolic continuity is seen as \"fidelity to the teaching of the apostles as set out in scripture, rather than in historical or institutional terms\" and thus they place focus on \"the gospel, and the means by which this is proclaimed, articulated, and reinforced--namely, the ministers of word and sacrament.\""]}, {"page": "British Entomology", "response": ["*Volume 5 \u2013 Lepidoptera (Part 1) dedicated to James Charles Dale and Charles Daubeny"]}, {"page": "1860 Oxford evolution debate", "response": ["The controversy was at the centre of attention when the British Association for the Advancement of Science (often referred to then simply as \"the BA\") convened their annual meeting at the new Oxford University Museum of Natural History in June 1860.
