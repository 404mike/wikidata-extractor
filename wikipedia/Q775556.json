The match was played on 29 October 1988 and ended in a 1\u20131 draw. The replay was held three days later and ended in a 3\u20130 victory for Sutton, who qualified for the first round where they were drawn away against Dagenham. Two goals from Paul McKinnon and one each from Lennie Dennis and Paul Rogers saw Sutton win 4\u20130. In the second round, Sutton faced Aylesbury United away in front of 2,135 spectators. A goal from Dennis secured a 1\u20130 win for the visitors who progressed to the third round where they faced Coventry City. Sutton were 13th in the Conference, and went into the FA Cup tie with indifferent league form, having lost away to bottom club Aylesbury United and drawn at home against Maidstone United. In contrast to their opponents, Sutton's players were not professional footballers, and their squad included bricklayers, assistant bank managers and insurance clerks. Their goalkeeper, Trevor Roffey, was the son of Dave Roffey who had played for Sutton United in their fourth-round defeat against Leeds United in 1970.", "|FW ||10|| Paul McKinnon"]}, {"page": "McKinnon, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul McKinnon"]}]}}
