Notwithstanding the efforts of Frederic Seebohm to find the origin of villeinage in the status of the serfs who worked for Roman masters upon British farms long before the Teutonic immigrations began, an older theory still holds the field, namely, that the abject villeins of Norman days were descendants of free\u2013born ceorls of Anglo\u2013Saxon stock. On this theory, most of England was once cultivated by Anglo\u2013Saxon peasant proprietors grouped in little societies, each of which formed an isolated village. These villagers were slowly sinking from their originally free estate during several centuries prior to 1066: but the process of their degradation was completed rapidly and roughly by the Norman conquerors. The once free peasantry were crushed down into the dependent villeins of the eleventh and twelfth centuries."]}, {"page": "Great Wymondley", "response": ["In the late 19th century the historian Frederic Seebohm, who lived in Hitchin, studied Wymondley's field system using detailed maps.

Already Dame Mary Radcliffe and Vicar Hildesley (not a relation to Mark Hildelsey) had founded the Girls' School, and so the Boys' School was born again. Natural Science, Drawing and English Grammar were among the subjects to be compulsory teaching for the School.

He developed an argument that the Roman settlers in Britain survived the Teutonic conquests of the fifth century, and that the laws and customs observed under Anglo-Saxon rule were in large part of Roman origin. This theory was first advanced by Coote in the Gentleman's Magazine, and then A Neglected Fact in English History (1864). Edward Augustus Freeman subjected his views to attack in Macmillan's Magazine in 1870. In 1878 Coote published The Romans of Britain, expanding his position, and he had some support from Frederic Seebohm in his English Village Community (1883). The underlying issue of institutional continuity was taken up again in the middle of the 20th century."]}, {"page": "Irish measure", "response": ["The Irish acre or plantation acre measured one Irish chain by one Irish furlong, or 4 Irish perches by 40, or 7840 square yards: approximately 0.66 hectares or 1.62 statute acres.  The Lancashire acre around the Solway Firth and the Churchland acre in Yorkshire were the same size, which Frederic Seebohm in 1914 connected to the  of Gwent in Wales.   The Ordnance Survey of Ireland from its 1824 foundation used statute acres in its maps, which were used in turn for Griffith's Valuation and the census.  The Irish acre remained common in Irish newspaper advertisements for farmland and other property until the middle of the 20th century."]}, {"page": "Wymondley Roman Villa", "response": ["It is situated in the valley of the River Purwell in the parish of Great Wymondley. In Roman times, as now, the villa would have been above a wetland which is preserved as the Purwell Ninesprings nature reserve. East of the villa there is an agricultural landscape extending towards a Roman road at Graveley. Wymondley preserves a field system of Roman origin; this early date for the field boundaries was proposed in the 19th century by Frederic Seebohm,The English Village Community. Seebohm, F. 1883.

We do not know on what basis the land was allotted. At some other places the Romans are known to have distributed land to veterans. In the case of Wymondley, Applebaum speculates that some of the land was farmed by tenants of the villa's owners.Applebaum, S. \"The Pattern of Settlement in Roman Britain.\" The Agricultural History Review 11, no. 1 (1963): 1-14.
