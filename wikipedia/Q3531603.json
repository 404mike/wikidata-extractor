A left-handed batsman and a right-arm off break bowler, he played his domestic cricket for Kent County Cricket Club and was appointed as County Captain for the 2013 season. He made his debut for Kent in the 2001 season, nine days before his first appearance for England Under-19s. He often fielded at slip.\nHe was part of the one-day set-up for Kent since 2002, but did not secure a regular place in the first-class County Championship team until 2007, a year after taking his maiden ten-wicket haul. He was selected as part of the England One Day International (ODI) squad to tour New Zealand in 2007\u201308, but had to wait until 2010 to make his international debut.\nAfter impressing during the 2009 season with Kent, helping the team gain promotion back to the first division of the County Championship, Tredwell played his first Test and ODIs against Bangladesh in March 2010. His Twenty20 International debut followed two years later. He took 78 wickets in 74 international matches.\nIn September 2018, Tredwell announced his retirement from cricket having been injured for the entire 2018 domestic season after making five appearances in Kent's pre-season campaign in the West Indies 2017\u201318 Regional Super50 competition. In 2019 he was appointed to the ECB National Umpires Panel, qualifying him to stand as an umpire in Second XI and Minor Counties fixtures.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Folkestone", "response": ["Folkestone Cricket Club currently competes in the first division of the Kent Cricket League.

He played a handful of List A matches in his first season with Kent; in that format he was used as both a middle-order and opening batsman.

At Headingley England opted for an all pace bowling attack, leaving Swann out of the side for the first time in 43 Tests. In the event Kevin Pietersen was called on to bowl 16 overs in the match and took 4 wickets with his part-time off-breaks and Swann was immediately recalled to the side.
