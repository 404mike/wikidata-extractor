Whilst challenging with Pedro Mendes for a loose ball Thatcher viciously and intentionally led with his elbow, knocking Mendes into the advertising hoardings rendering him unconscious. Mendes required oxygen at pitchside and suffered a seizure while being transferred to hospital, where he spent the night. Mendes was discharged from hospital the next day, but remained under medical supervision. Thatcher was not sent off by referee Dermot Gallagher but given just a yellow card, but he was investigated by the FA as a result of the challenge. He was disciplined and his barrister, Rupert Bowers, read a written apology following the hearing. Greater Manchester Police noted receipt of many \"statements of complaint\" and also chose to investigate the matter. On 30 August, Manchester City announced that Thatcher would be banned for six matches, two of which would be suspended, and fined six weeks' wages for the challenge. This punishment is separate from the sanctions made by the FA, who suspended Thatcher for eight matches, with a further fifteen game suspended ban for two years. Mendes shook hands with Thatcher pre-match when they next faced one another in January 2007, despite claiming beforehand that he would not do so."]}, {"page": "Gallagher (surname)", "response": ["*Dermot Gallagher, Irish football referee"]}, {"page": "Joe Lewis (footballer)", "response": ["His first full season at London Road Stadium resulted in another promotion where the club won promotion to the Championship. On 13 April 2009, Lewis was made to face a penalty three times against Millwall in an unusual refereeing decision. After David Martin of Millwall was tripped and a penalty awarded against Peterborough, Lewis was twice judged by the assistant referee to have moved off his line before the ball had been struck by Gary Alexander \u2013 on both occasions Lewis saved the penalty. At the third attempt, Millwall replaced the unsuccessful Alexander with Martin, who scored and this time the penalty stood. Speaking on Sky Sports News after the event, ex-referee Dermot Gallagher commented that whilst the assistant was consistently working to the letter of the law, his decisions were harsh."]}, {"page": "Michael Oakes", "response": ["Oakes began his career in Aston Villa's youth system.
