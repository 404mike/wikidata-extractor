He worked as a writer and architectural draughtsperson and was elected to Newtownabbey Borough Council as an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) representative in 1980.  Agnew was also elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1982.\nIn 1990, Agnew served as the Mayor of Newtownabbey.  In the early 1990s, he left the UUP and was later re-elected as an independent Unionist. In 1996, standing for the 'Independent Templeton' ticket, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Northern Ireland Forum election in South Antrim.\nHe was elected as an independent in the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election, when he formed the United Unionist Coalition (UUC) with other anti-Good Friday Agreement unionists.\nAll three members of the UUC, including Agnew, lost their seats at the 2003 Assembly election. He held his council seat for the UUC in 2005. In March 2007, he was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Newtownabbey.  In January 2011, he rejoined the UUP. Tom Elliot, leader of the UUP had this to say regarding his decision: \u201cI strongly believe that voters across the province will return, like Fraser, to their natural Ulster Unionist home and I am looking forward to making sure that the UUP becomes the party of choice for all shades of progressive Unionist opinion.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "United Unionist Coalition", "response": ["The UUC was formed by three members of the Northern Ireland Assembly who had been elected as \"independent unionists\" in 1998, and decided to form themselves into an official grouping to avail of facilities provided by the Assembly to parties. As such they were more a coalition of political expediency rather than a coherent political party. The founders of the group, which was initially called the \"United Unionist Assembly Party\", were Fraser Agnew, Boyd Douglas and Denis Watson (all of whom have since left the grouping)."]}, {"page": "Newtownabbey Borough Council", "response": ["*1990 \u2013 91: Fraser Agnew, Ulster Unionist Party", "*2013 \u2013 14: Fraser Agnew, Ulster Unionist Party"]}, {"page": "Tara (Northern Ireland)", "response": ["The roots of Tara lay in a group known as \"The Cell\".
