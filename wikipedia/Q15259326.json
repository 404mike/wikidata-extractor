He studied the development of the endocrine glands and spleen and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at St George's Hospital Medical School in London. In 1855, he approached his colleague Henry Vandyke Carter with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuaries through the Anatomy Act of 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858 by John William Parker in London."]}, {"page": "Longman", "response": ["The two brothers were well known for their literary talent. Thomas Longman edited a beautifully illustrated edition of the New Testament, and William Longman was the author of several important books, among them a History of the Three Cathedrals dedicated to St Paul (1869) and a work on the History of the Life and Times of Edward III (1873). In 1863, the firm took over the business of John William Parker, and with it Fraser's Magazine, and the publication of the works of John Stuart Mill and James Anthony Froude; while in 1890 they incorporated with their own all the publications of the old firm of Rivington, established in 1711. The family control of the firm (later 'Longmans, Green & Co.') was continued by Thomas Norton Longman, son of Thomas Longman. In 1884 the firm employed John William Allen as an educationalist. Allen grew the firm's educational list, including textbooks he wrote himself. He later inherited the shares of W. E. Green and became a shareholder in 1918."]}, {"page": "John Parker", "response": ["*John William Parker (1792\u20131870), English publisher and printer"]}, {"page": "Essays and Reviews", "response": ["Essays and Reviews, edited by John William Parker, published in March 1860, is a broad-church volume of seven essays on Christianity.

The pair were found guilty and executed on the same day, 30\u00a0April 1650. Writing in 1834 John William Parker, publisher of The Saturday Magazine, suggested that the gibbet might have remained in use for longer in Halifax had the bailiff not been warned that if he used it again he would be \"called to public account for it\".

The Saturday Magazine was established as an Anglican rival to the Penny MagazineAndrew King & John Plunkett, Popular Print Media, 1820\u20131900, p. 5 as a way for the working man to educate himself.  The 4-page issues were sold for 1 penny per weekly issue, or sixpence for monthly parts. A typical edition of the Saturday Magazine began with an account of some exotic place. At this time the expansion of the British empire was speeding up and people at home in England were very interested in finding out what was happening around the world.
