The Acts of Union 1707 put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union between the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain.The Treaty or Act of the Union at scotshistoryonline.co.uk, accessed 1 February 2011William E. Burns, A Brief History of Great Britain, p. xxi This union meant that Scottish politicians tended to spend most of their time in London to attend the Parliament of the United Kingdom; the tendency was that these individuals became very wealthy. For example, Sir William Dundas, a Member of Parliament from the Highlands and Islands who served as one of Britain's Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, was involved in the financial and political structure of the Kingdom of Great Britain; his increased wealth allowed him to build his own mansion in Scotland. Under the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in the arts, sciences and engineering. This paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire, which became the largest in history. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Britain, with architecture adapted to industrial use."]}, {"page": "Perceval ministry", "response": ["! scope=row |William Dundas"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1801\u20131806)", "response": ["| 4 June 1804 || Sutherland || u* || William Dundas || William Dundas || appointed"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1806\u20131818)", "response": ["|2 May 1808||\tSutherland||\t\tu||William Dundas||John Randoll Mackenzie||Resignation", "|13 July 1810||Elgin Burghs||u||Archibald Campbell-Colquhoun||William Dundas||Resignation to contest Dunbartonshire", "|26 March 1812||Edinburgh||u*||Sir Patrick Murray||William Dundas||Resignation", "|13 April 1812||Elgin Burghs||u||William Dundas||Archibald Campbell||Resignation to contest Edinburgh", "|10 August 1814||Edinburgh||u*||William Dundas||William Dundas||Keeper of the Signet"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1818\u20131832)", "response": ["|29 July 1819||Edinburgh||c*||William Dundas||William Dundas||Keeper of Sasines"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edinburgh||William Dundas||"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain by-elections (1790\u20131800)", "response": ["|1 July 1794||Anstruther Easter||u||Robert Anstruther||William Dundas||Resignation", "|2 December 1797||Tain Burghs||u||William Dundas||William Dundas||Commissioner of the Board of Control"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edinburgh||William Dundas||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of ministerial by-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|29 July 1819||Edinburgh||c||William Dundas||William Dundas||Keeper of Sasines", "|10 August 1814||Edinburgh||u||William Dundas||William Dundas||Keeper of the Signet", "| 4 June 1804 || Sutherland || u|| William Dundas || William Dundas || Secretary at War"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1796 British general election", "response": ["|William Dundas"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edinburgh||William Dundas||Tory"]}, {"page": "Dundas, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Dundas"]}, {"page": "List of MPs in the first United Kingdom Parliament", "response": ["| William Dundas"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Dundas"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1802 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|  William Dundas"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1790 British general election", "response": ["| John Anstruther  \u2013 resigned  Replaced by Robert Anstruther 1793 \u2013 resigned  Replaced by William Dundas  1794"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1807 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Patrick Murray \u2013 resigned Replaced by William Dundas 1812", "| Archibald Campbell-Colquhoun \u2013 resigned Replaced by William Dundas 1810\u2013 resigned Replaced by Archibald Campbell  to contest Edinburgh 1812", "| William Dundas   \u2013 resigned Replaced by John Randoll Mackenzie 1808 \u2013 died Replaced by George Macpherson Grant 1809"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1812 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|   William Dundas   "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|   William Dundas   "]}, {"page": "Commissioners of Highland Roads and Bridges", "response": ["The commission was created following the 1802 inspection by Thomas Telford (on behalf of the government) of the state of the roads.
