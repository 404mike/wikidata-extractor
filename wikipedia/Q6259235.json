The modern accepted start of the Mersey is at the confluence of the Tame and Goyt, in central Stockport, Greater Manchester. However, older definitions, and many older maps, place its start a few miles up the Goyt at Compstall; for example the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica states \"It is formed by the junction of the Goyt and the Etherow a short distance below Marple in Cheshire on the first-named stream.\" The 1784 John Stockdale map shows the River Mersey extending to Mottram, and forming the boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire. In the west of Stockport it flows at the base of a cliff below the road called Brinksway before reaching flat country."]}, {"page": "Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine", "response": ["In 1789 he was counsel for John Stockdale, a bookseller, who was charged with seditious libel in publishing John Logan's pamphlet in support of Warren Hastings, whose impeachment was then proceeding. Erskine's speech, which resulted in the Stockdale's acquittal, argued that a defendant should not be convicted if his composition, taken as a whole, did not go beyond a free and fair discussion, even if selected passages might be libellous. Henry Brougham considered this to be one of Erskine's finest speeches: \"It is justly regarded, by all English lawyers, as a consummate specimen of the art of addressing a jury\".Lovat-Fraser 1932: 31"]}, {"page": "Stockdale", "response": ["*John Stockdale Hardy (1793\u20131849) English antiquarian ", "*John Stockdale (1750\u20131814), English publisher", "**John Joseph Stockdale (1770\u20131847), publisher, son of John Stockdale", "**Mary Stockdale (1774\u20131854), writer and publisher, daughter of John Stockdale"]}, {"page": "Samuel Ayscough", "response": ["Until Ayscough brought out his Index in 1790 there had been no concordance to Shakespeare. This was a speculation on the part of the publisher, John Stockdale, who paid 200 guineas for the index, which was designed to accompany his two-volume edition of the Dramatic Works. Here the words are arranged alphabetically with the lines in which they occur, then the name of the play, and in five separate columns the act, scene, page, column and line. The last three particulars refer only to the edition of 1790, but the index may be made to serve any other text. Francis Twiss compiled his Verbal Index in 1805; both were superseded by Mrs Cowden Clarke's Concordance of 1845. All three are devoted to the plays alone and are supplemented by Mrs Furness's Concordance to Shakespeare's Poems (1874). There was still no complete concordance to the entire works in the late 19th century."]}, {"page": "Notes on the State of Virginia", "response": ["It was the only full-length book that Jefferson published during his lifetime.

He became a Unitarian minister, preaching his first sermon on 8 June 1806 at Parliament Street Chapel, Bishopsgate, but he never held any pastoral charge, and supported himself chiefly by writing. He contributed frequently to early volumes of the Monthly Repository. After the publication of his Portraiture of Methodism (1807) he was exposed to much criticism.
