The eleven commissioners appointed to the commissioner were: Sir William Page Wood, Sir John Taylor Coleridge, Joseph Napier, Sir Alexander Cockburn, Sir Richard Bethell, Sir Thomas Erskine Perry, John Shaw-Lefevre, Henry Singer Keating, Thomas Greenwood, James Stewart and Germain Lavie. Stewart seems to have had little involvement, not attending any meetings or signing the report when it was issued on 10 August 1855.  The secretary was Julius Talbot Airey who received a 150 guinea allowance for his services."]}]}}
