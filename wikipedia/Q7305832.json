He is Sheffield Wednesday's leading post-war goalscorer with 166 goals. He was signed in 1956 and made his Wednesday debut two years later. Fantham firmly established himself as an able goalscorer in the English top flight for Wednesday, as his 23 goals helped the club to a second-place finish in 1960\u201361. The following season, he netted 24 times, earning him selection for the England under-23 team and his only England cap at full international level. He was an integral part of the Wednesday side that reached the 1966 FA Cup Final and two years later, he passed Redfern Froggatt's post war scoring record. Fantham made 435 appearances for the club, staying until 1969 when he joined Rotherham United."]}, {"page": "Gerry Young", "response": ["Born in Harton in South Shields, Young played schools' football in Jarrow. He was on the books of Newcastle United at the age of 16, but returned to junior football after finding opportunities limited. Upon leaving school, Young played for the Hawthorn Leslie shipyard team in Hebburn, then in County Durham. Young signed for Sheffield Wednesday in the early part of 1955 as a centre forward, however his chances of breaking into the side were restricted by the presence of players of the calibre of Redfern Froggatt and Roy Shiner. He made his debut on 2 March 1957 in an away defeat at Blackpool, but did not become a regular in the Wednesday side until December 1962 when Tony Kay was sold to Everton and Young was switched to central defence by manager Vic Buckingham as a replacement. While playing as a forward in the 1961\u201362 season he scored a hat trick in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against A.S. Roma."]}, {"page": "Jack Froggatt", "response": ["Coming from a footballing family, Froggatt started his football career in 1945, whilst in the RAF.
