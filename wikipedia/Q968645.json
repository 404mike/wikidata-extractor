In the end, Ballard wrote most of the songs and performed most of the instruments in addition to his production duties. For the most part, Beckley and Bunnell were singers on an album that Ballard had crafted for them, although they did contribute some of their own material. On one track, Bunnell decided to rewrite Ballard's lyrics, and the successful song \"The Border\" was the result. Set to the backing of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the saxophone work of Raphael Ravenscroft, the single scored number 33 on the charts in August 1983. \"The Border\" was much more successful on the adult contemporary charts, where it scored number four (even bettering \"You Can Do Magic\"). It also made number 24 on the Dutch top 40. A second single, Ballard's \"Cast the Spirit\", failed to chart. The album itself, released in June 1983, was reasonably successful at number 81, but something of a disappointment, when compared to its predecessor."]}, {"page": "The Final Cut (album)", "response": ["American composer Michael Kamen, who had contributed to The Wall, co-produced, oversaw the orchestral arrangements,  and mediated between Waters and Gilmour. He also stood in for keyboardist Richard Wright, who had left the band under pressure from Waters during the recording of The Wall. James Guthrie was studio engineer and co-producer, while Mason's drumming was supplemented by Ray Cooper on percussion; when Mason was unable to perform the complex time changes on \"Two Suns in the Sunset\", he was replaced by Andy Newmark. Mason also suggested the repeated reprises of \"Maggie, what have we done\" be rendered instrumental rather than sung. Raphael Ravenscroft was hired to play the saxophone. Recording took place in the latter half of 1982 across eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at Hookend Manor, and Waters' Billiard Room Studios at East Sheen.

As the singer recalled in a 1988 interview with Colin Irwin: \"When I wrote the song I saw that bit as an instrumental part but I didn't know what. We tried electric guitar but it sounded weak, and we tried other things and I think it was Hugh Murphy's suggestion that we tried saxophone.\"", "In his interview with Colin Irwin, Rafferty disputed this and said that Ravenscroft had been his second choice to play the saxophone solo, after Pete Zorn, who was unavailable: \"The only confusion at the time that I didn\u2019t enjoy too much was the fact that a lot of people believed that the line was written by Raphael Ravenscroft, the sax player, but it was my line. I sang it to him.\" When a remastered version of City to City was released in 2011, it included the original, electric guitar version of the song, confirming Rafferty's authorship of the riff. In the liner notes to the album, Rafferty's long-time friend and collaborator Rab Noakes commented: \"Let's hope [the Baker Street demo] will, at last, silence all who keep on asserting that the saxophone player came up with the melody line. He didn't. He just blew what he was told by the person who did write it, Gerry Rafferty.\" Michael Gray, Rafferty's former manager, agreed: \"The audible proof is there from the demos that Rafferty himself created the riff and placed it within the song's structure exactly where it ended up.\" Ravenscroft went on to play on Rafferty's next two albums."]}, {"page": "Flickering Flame: The Solo Years Volume 1", "response": ["*Raphael Ravenscroft, Kevin Flanagan, Vic Sullivan\u00a0\u2013 horns"]}, {"page": "In Our Lifetime (Marvin Gaye album)", "response": ["*Raphael Ravenscroft \u2013 alto saxophone"]}, {"page": "Earth Moving", "response": ["* Raphael Ravenscroft \u2013 saxophone"]}, {"page": "Baker Street (song)", "response": ["The album City to City (1978), including \"Baker Street\", was co-produced by Rafferty and Hugh Murphy.

Benny and Bj\u00f6rn have stated that the song sounded 'wrong': the verse and chorus did not fit together, and that is why it was scrapped. The two men admit this happens regularly in their way of writing music: a mediocre song can become a bridge or a riff for another song, and a good melody line can lie around for many years until it surfaces in a composition. Benny and Bj\u00f6rn nevertheless allowed for a 'snippet' of \"Just Like That\" to be released in a 'medley' track on the box set Thank You for the Music in 1994. Although this snippet only revealed the chorus of the track, it is notable for featuring a saxophone solo by Raphael Ravenscroft, perhaps best known for his famous saxophone riff on Gerry Rafferty's 1978 hit \"Baker Street\".
