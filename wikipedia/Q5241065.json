He graduated with an MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art in 2003. He lives and works in London.In 2003, after being nominated for the Lexmark European Art Prize, (and while still studying at the Royal College of Art), Meredith Etherington-Smith, former editor of Art Review, said of his short-listed piece: \"David Wightman frames his picture perfect Swiss postcard in the cool collateral of a Ben Nicholson modernist painting\".In 2009, he showed a large site-specific painting: Behemoth at Cornerhouse, Manchester (2009) and went on to exhibit with Sumarria Lunn Gallery at The Hempel, London (2010).  In 2010-11 he was one of two artists (the other being Hannah Maybank) selected for the Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowships - a six-month residency supported by English Heritage and Arts Council England. The residency took place in a Nicholas Hawksmoor designed former military gymnasium in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. In 2013, he was commissioned by HOUSE Festival in Brighton (selected by artist Mariele Neudecker)  to make a site-specific painting for a disused pavilion on Brighton's seafront. The piece (Hero) is the largest painting by the artist to date.Cherie Federico, editor of Aesthetica magazine has said: \"You must spend time with Wightman\u2019s paintings; on the surface they are beautiful and intricate, but like the layers they are made from, there is so much depth to his works\".  In 2012 he had his first major solo show entitled Paramour at Halcyon Gallery, London. His work is held in several public collections including the Royal College of Art and General Energy UK. Wightman collaborated with the Swiss fashion house Akris as part of their Fall / Winter 2014/15 collection.\nWightman's first international solo show opened in October 2018 at Duran|Mashaal Gallery in Montr\u00e9al, Canada. Wightman's last UK solo show My Atalanta opened in October 2021 at Long & Ryle, London. The gallery director Sarah Long has said of his work: \"His landscape paintings are beautiful distractions. The intricate collaged wallpaper and unusual colour choices are compelling: they function as abstract compositions as well as imaginary vistas. His paintings offer a glimpse of another world - seemingly real yet entirely fictional\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*David Wightman (born 1980)"]}, {"page": "Lorelei", "response": ["* The British painter David Wightman has several landscape paintings and an exhibition named after the folklore.http://www.davidwightman.net/lorelei.html"]}, {"page": "Akris", "response": ["*2014 Akris celebrates 10 years at Paris Fashion Week.

The company delayed participating in Paris Fashion Week until 2004, when it was able to secure a spot on one of the event's most important days. In the 2000s, the company was one of the world's fastest-growing designer brands, selling at stores such as Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus., where Akris shares floor space with brands like Bottega Veneta, Fendi and Lanvin.Martin, J.J. Albert Kriemler Expands Akris's Global Footprint (November 19, 2015) Akris's success is largely due to trunk shows and word of mouth; the company does very little advertising. Unlike other fashion houses, the company does not produce fragrances and does not license its name. Akris have a reputation for working with artists. Two notable examples have been a collaboration with the German photographer Thomas Ruff and separately the British painter David Wightman."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Middlesex University", "response": ["* David Wightman, English painter"]}, {"page": "Hannah Maybank", "response": ["In 2010/11 she was one of two artists (the other being David Wightman) awarded a six-month residency as part of the Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowships in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland."]}, {"page": "David Wightman", "response": ["David Wightman may refer to:", "*David Wightman (painter) (born 1980), English painter", "*David Wightman (priest) (born 1939), Anglican priest", "*David Wightman, see Scottish Broadcasting Commission"]}, {"page": "Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowship", "response": ["2010 David Wightman, Hannah Maybank (fellowship holders 2010/11)"]}, {"page": "Ondine", "response": ["* Ondine, a painting by David Wightman (2017/18)"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* David Wightman (painter)"]}]}}
