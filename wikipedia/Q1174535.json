The sample distribution from the standing stones was compared with the theoretical distribution to show that the occurrence of straight lines was no more than average."]}, {"page": "List of mathematical probabilists", "response": ["*David George Kendall (1918\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Thom", "response": ["adequately explained by, say, monuments being set out by pacing, with the 'unit' reflecting an average length of pace.\" David George Kendall had previously argued that pacing would have created a greater difference in measurements between sites, he concluded after investigation for the Royal Academy, that \"The hypothesis of a smooth, non-quantal distribution of circle diameters (for Scottish, English and Welsh true circles) is thus rejected at the 1% level.\""]}, {"page": "Megalithic yard", "response": ["adequately explained by, say, monuments being set out by pacing, with the 'unit' reflecting an average length of pace.\" David George Kendall makes the same argument, and says that pacing would have created a greater difference in measurements between sites, and that a statistical analysis of sites would reveal whether they were measured by pacing or not. In an investigation for the Royal Academy Kendall concluded that there was evidence of a uniform unit in Scottish circles but not in English circles, and that further research was needed.
