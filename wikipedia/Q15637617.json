In the early 1840s, after training as an architect, he moved to live in Bangor, North Wales.\nAbout 1858 he entered into partnership with a Bristol-born architect, John Mechelen Rogers (c.1831\u20131889), who afterwards moved to London. The partnership ended about 1866 and Kennedy then entered into a new one with Gustavus O\u2019Donoghue of Glasgow, also of London, which ended in 1871. After that Kennedy worked alone until shortly before his death.\nMost of his work was for the Diocese of Bangor, where he dominated church architecture for over fifty years, leaving his mark on most of the churches in the area. During his career he had been involved in some 80 applications to the Incorporated Church Building Society for grants to carry out work in the Bangor diocese. His two partners played little part in his Welsh projects.\nHenry Kennedy died in 1896. He had married Emily Du Pre, the third daughter of Rev Thomas Du Pre, Rector of Willoughby, Lincolnshire. They had two children, Emily and Henry Du Pre Kennedy.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plas Newydd (Anglesey)", "response": [";Church of St. Edwen: Grade II listed church, an ancient church site, completely rebuilt in 1856 to a design by the Bangor architect Henry Kennedy by the 2nd Marquess, two years after he succeeded to the title.British Listed Buildings: wa-19743 - St Edwen's Church, listed 1998  "]}, {"page": "List of British architects", "response": ["*Henry Kennedy (c. 1814\u20131898)"]}, {"page": "Llandygai", "response": ["The present church dates to around 1330 and  was much restored and extended by the diocesan architect, Henry Kennedy, in 1853.
