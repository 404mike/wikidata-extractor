He was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire and graduated in botany from University College London in 1905. In 1913, he obtained a D.Sc. with a thesis on fossil seeds and was appointed a senior lecturer at East London College. He returned to University College London as a senior lecturer, from 1924 as a reader in plant ecology and from 1929 as Quain Professor of botany.\nHe was director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew from 1943 to 1956. He was responsible for the restoration of the gardens after the Second World War.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 15 March 1933 and won the society's Royal Medal in 1945 for \"his notable contributions to plant ecology and to the study of the British flora generally\". In 1936, he was awarded The Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society in acknowledgement of his book The Living Garden (1935), which was enormously popular. In 1939, he received the Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1946 he was knighted.\nAt first, his research was focussed on forest ecology, particularly in his native Hertfordshire. Later, he pioneered investigations of seed size and reproductive output of plants in relation to habitat. He also investigated the ecology of garden weeds and of dune plants.\nHe was elected President of the Sussex Wildlife Trust in January 1962, where he remained in office until April 1967.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Edward James Salisbury (1886\u20131978), British botanistAbbreviation in botany: E.Salisb. with \"notable contributions to plant ecology and to the study of the British flora generally\""]}, {"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*Edward James Salisbury"]}, {"page": "Salisbury (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Edward James Salisbury (1886\u20131978), director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew"]}, {"page": "E.Salisb.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward James Salisbury"]}, {"page": "Roads Beautifying Association", "response": ["Its members were chosen for knowledge and experience and chiefly included: Lionel de Rothschild, who was Chairman of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), Mr. F.
