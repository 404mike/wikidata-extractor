The club were hit by financial troubles after being told they had to pay fines totalling \u00a3250,000, and at one point were at risk of being wound up. As a result, Horton was forced to cope without assistant John Askey, after Askey was dismissed to cut costs. The sale of top-scorer Jon Parkin also robbed Horton of his best player. Following a poor start to the season he placed four players on the transfer-list. He also placed Kevin Townson on the transfer-list, before sacking the striker after Townson displayed \"serious misconduct\". Throughout the campaign, Horton signed goalkeeper Tommy Lee, striker Clyde Wijnhard, midfielder Alan Navarro, forward Allan Russell, and striker Matty McNeil. The \"Silkmen\" finished in 17th-place, five points above the relegation zone. Horton prepared for the 2006\u201307 campaign by searching for a new midfield player, and found one in Shrewsbury Town's Jamie Tolley. He also signed versatile attacker Colin Heath, defender Carl Regan, and former Port Vale goalkeeper Jonny Brain; whilst releasing five players. Horton was sacked in October 2006, after his team failed to win any of their opening twelve league games, leaving them bottom of the Football League."]}, {"page": "Stephen Dawson", "response": ["Dawson made his Leyton Orient debut, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Yeovil Town in the opening game of the season. Since making his debut, he established himself in the starting eleven and played in every match from the beginning until he suffered a groin injury, resulting him being on the substitute bench to heal his injury and eventually his illness. However, during 3\u20130 win over Bristol Rovers, in which he set up one of the goals, Dawson received a horror tackle from Carl Regan, resulted him being substituted, which he described it as \"a leg-breaker.\" Dawson scored his first goal for the O's on his return in their 2\u20131 win against Tranmere Rovers on 11 December 2010. For his performance, Dawson was named League One's Team of the Week. It wasn't until on 8 February 2011 when he scored his second goal, in a 3\u20130 win over Swindon Town. Weeks later on 20 February 2011, Dawson played a vital role throughout a 1\u20131 draw against Arsenal in the 5th round of the FA Cup, naming him Man of the Match; but lost 5\u20130 in the FA  replay. Despite suffering from another injury, Dawson finished his first season at Leyton Orient, making the total of 50 appearances and scoring 2 times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Luke Dimech", "response": ["On 19 July 2007, Dimech signed a one-year deal with manager Ian Brightwell to join League Two side Macclesfield TownMacclesfield bag defender Dimech and was re-united with Carl Regan who he played alongside in Chester City's defence.", "On 31 January 2008, Dimech and Carl Regan's partnership came to an end as Regan joined former Macclesfield-manager Paul Ince at Milton Keynes Dons.

ArtVandelay13 has created articles for Lee Boylan and Carl Regan for example. In the infobox for the former the years are shown as \"2006-2007\" whilst in the latter they are shown as  \"2005-06\". I know it's only my opinion, but I prefer the former style and think the Regan infobox looks messy - furthermore I can see no need for shorthand when column space is not a problem.
