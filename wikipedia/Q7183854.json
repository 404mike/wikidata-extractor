He was educated at Dulwich College between 1928 and 1932.\nGardner was 26 years old, and an acting Captain in the 4th Royal Tank Regiment, attached to the 70th Infantry Division during the Second World War's Siege of Tobruk. During Operation Crusader, an attempt by the Eighth Army to lift the siege, the following deed took place for which Gardner was the Victoria Cross.\nOn 23 November 1941 at Tobruk, Libya, Captain Gardner was ordered to take two tanks to the rescue of two armoured cars of the King's Dragoon Guards, which were out of action and under heavy attack. While one of his tanks gave covering fire the captain dismounted from the other in the face of heavy fire, hitched a tow rope to one of the cars, then lifted into it an officer, both of whose legs had been blown off. The tow rope broke, so Captain Gardner returned to the armoured car, but was immediately wounded in the neck, arm and leg. Despite this he managed to transfer the wounded man to the second tank and returned to British lines through intense shell-fire.He was captured after the Battle of Gazala and became a POW for the rest of the war. \nThis unfortunately resulted in an injury that left him with a deformed toeHis VC is on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Philip John Gardner || British Army || 1941 || Second World War || Tobruk"]}, {"page": "Westminster Dragoons", "response": ["On mobilisation at the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the Westminster Dragoons became an Officer Cadet Training Unit, with over 90 per cent of pre-war Westminster Dragoons gaining their commissions and transferring into units throughout the British Army before the Regiment reverted to an armoured role in 1940.

The materials are the same as those of the chapels.  It is Sussex's oldest crematorium.  Known as the Brighton Borough Crematorium at first, it was renamed the Woodvale Crematorium when the Parochial Cemetery (as it was known from 1902) became the Woodvale Cemetery in 1955.  There is a memorial placed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission listing 54 Commonwealth service personnel of World War II cremated here, comprising 12 Royal Navy sailors, 19 British Army soldiers, 18 British airmen, 2 merchant seamen, a Home Guardsman, a Canadian and an Indian serviceman.  Two Victoria Cross winners were also cremated here:  Major General William George Wallace (1863\u20131936) and Captain Philip John Gardner, late Royal Tank Regiment (1914\u20132003).  In 1947, the occultist Aleister Crowley (who had died at Hastings) was cremated there.  About 20 of his followers attended the service; as soon as Crowley's coffin was brought out, they \"began chanting black magic incantations, to the astonishment of the attendants and undertakers\", and Louis Wilkinson read excerpts from the Gnostic Mass, The Book of the Law, and \"Hymn to Pan\". Following newspaper reports that a Black Mass had been held at the ceremony, the council moved to ban the practice at the chapel: councillors described the events as \"a desecration of consecrated ground\" and stated that they had offended the whole town.  In 2020, the cremation and private burial of \"Forces' Sweetheart\" Dame Vera Lynn took place at Woodvale following a military procession from her home village of Ditchling."]}, {"page": "Pip (nickname)", "response": ["* Philip John Gardner (1914-2003), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2003", "response": ["*Philip John Gardner, 88, British recipient of the Victoria Cross."]}]}}
