L. Moore, which sailed out of Plymouth, England, in 1848, on a mission to find the lost remains of Sir John Franklin's Northwest Passage expedition of 1845.\nSouth of the Bering Straits at the onset of winter, the Plover  overwintered in Providence Bay, Siberia, which they named for the fortune that brought them there. Hooper and his companions fell in with the Chukchi, an experience he wrote about in his book Ten Months among the Tents of the Tuski (1853).\nHis health weakened by three Arctic winters, Hooper died in London on 19 May 1854.", "link_mentions": {}}}
