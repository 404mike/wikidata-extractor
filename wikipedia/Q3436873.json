He managed Sutton United from the late seventies until moving onto Malm\u00f6 and then Viking in 1984. In 1987, he was coach of Tottenham Hotspur's youth team. In 1997, Blunt was head coach at the Centre of Excellence in Lilleshall in England. From 1998, he has worked as a football coach at various teams in China, including the national U-23 and U-19.He spent time with Loughborough College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Viking FK", "response": ["*  Keith Blunt (1984)"]}, {"page": "Malm\u00f6 FF", "response": ["Much of the success during the 1970s was due to new tactics and training methods brought to the club by Englishman Bob Houghton, who managed the club between 1974 and 1980. Eric Persson was succeeded as chairman in 1974 by Hans Cavalli-Bj\u00f6rkman. After the team performed respectably under managers Keith Blunt and Tord Grip in the early 1980s, Roy Hodgson took over in 1985. Roy Hodgson led Malm\u00f6 FF to two Swedish Championships in 1986 and 1988, and the club won Allsvenskan five years in a row between 1985 and 1989. At the time, the championship was decided by play-offs between the best teams after the end of the regular season; this arrangement was in place from 1982 until 1992. The club reached the play-off final four times between 1986 and 1989 but only managed to win the final twice. Apart from Allsvenskan and Swedish Championships, Malm\u00f6 FF won Svenska Cupen in 1984, 1986 and 1989.Smitt, 2009, pp. 76\u201380."]}, {"page": "Sutton Grammar School", "response": ["*Keith Blunt \u2013 football manager and coach (Sutton United, Tottenham Hotspur and Malm\u00f6 FF), technical director of the FA's School of Excellence and member of the FA's Coaching Hall of Fame"]}, {"page": "Sutton United F.C.", "response": ["Unfortunately, the next decade proved to be one of little success for the club and Sutton went through a succession of managers, including Ted Powell and Dario Gradi, both of whom played for the team and went on to manage at higher levels. It was not until Keith Blunt took charge that success returned to Gander Green Lane. His biggest achievement was to win the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1979, after a surprise 2\u20131 win over Chieti. This was the only time an English club won the honour in its semi-professional era.", "Soon after the continental win, Keith Blunt moved on to manage Malm\u00f6 and Barrie Williams took over. He guided Sutton to Wembley for the 1981 FA Trophy final, but the side lost to Bishop's Stortford. This was to be the club's last appearance at Wembley, a place which saw little success for them. During Williams's reign the club finished runners-up in the Anglo-Italian Cup twice more, in 1980 and 1982. The club also finished runners-up in the 1981\u201382 Isthmian League and in 1983 won a treble of the Surrey Senior, London Senior, and Hitachi Cups. The Surrey Senior Cup win was the first of six in as many years, a record that remains unbroken, ."]}]}}
