Three days later he made his debut when starting at left-back against Galway United at Terryland Park The young defender made a huge impression after arriving at the club and he went on to make the right-back position his own, replacing regular number two Shaun Kelly. In total, he made 16 appearances in all competitions, and his performances earned him a new one-year deal which he agreed with the club on 28 October, just over 24 hours before Dundalk's final game of the 2010 season. Following the departure of club captain Liam Burns, Simon was handed the armband by Foster in 2011 pre-season and kept hold of it, with his ultra-consistent performances showing exactly why he was given the responsibility. He went on to become the only one of the squad to play every minute of competitive action during the year. Overall, Madden played every second of the club's 66 competitive games after signing, reaching the half century away to Derry City on 22 July.
