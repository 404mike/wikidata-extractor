The band was initially called RKO, then Radio. They later vacillated between calling themselves the Europeans and the Psychedelic Furs, playing gigs under both names before permanently settling on the latter. The word psychedelic was chosen to separate the band from punk rockers who ostentatiously scorned the legacy of 1960s rock music.", "The band initially consisted of Richard Butler (vocals), Tim Butler (bass guitar), Duncan Kilburn (saxophone), Paul Wilson (drums) and Roger Morris (guitars). By 1979, this line-up had expanded to a sextet with Vince Ely replacing Wilson on drums and John Ashton joining as a second guitarist. The Psychedelic Furs' debut, a self-titled album released in March 1980, was produced by Steve Lillywhite.

Released as a single, it became their biggest hit to date in the US and their biggest UK hit. Butler later claimed that the success of \"Pretty in Pink\" caused the band to be pressured into entering the recording studio with producer Chris Kimsey to record a follow-up release before they were ready. The result was Midnight to Midnight, their biggest Top 40 success to date, but an album that Richard Butler later characterized as \"hollow, vapid and weak\".
