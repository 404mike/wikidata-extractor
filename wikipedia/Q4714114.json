Two weeks later, his second and final game was the home match at Taunton against Nottinghamshire. He made 2 not out batting at No 11 in the first innings and took one catch, but was then tried as a makeshift opener in the second Somerset innings, when the county batted again with very little time left on the second day. The move was not a success: Cunningham was out for 2 before the close of play, the only time in his first-class career when he was dismissed.He did not play first-class cricket again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Alec Cunningham (1930) 2 matches CA"]}]}}
