He joined Sheffield Wednesday as a youth and debuted in their professional side in 1951. He played almost 250 league games for Wednesday and became known as the \"Golden Boy\", also being capped five times for the England national team. Quixall joined Manchester United in 1958 for a record transfer fee, a signing made by Matt Busby to rebuild his team following the Munich air disaster. Quixall played 184 games for United and was regarded by Bobby Charlton as key to many of his goals in this era. He ended his football career at Oldham Athletic and Stockport County. In retirement he lived in Greater Manchester and ran a scrap metal firm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matt Busby", "response": ["After the crash, Busby built a new side around Munich survivors including Harry Gregg, Bobby Charlton and Bill Foulkes.

He played in nine straight games and scored his first goal during a 2\u20130 victory in the Manchester derby at Maine Road. He spent the following season primarily with the reserve team to develop his skills. Chisnall was given the number 8 shirt at the start of the 1963\u201364 season, displacing Albert Quixall. He went on to form a strike partnership with Ian Moir and David Sadler, both of whom had also been recently promoted. His performance resulted in his being called up to the England under-23 team in November 1963. He made one appearance for the England squad, a 4\u20132 win over Germany at Anfield. Alf Ramsey said at the time that Chisnall was \"probably the best passer of a ball in the country\". However, he fell out of favour from the club starting lineup towards the latter part of 1963\u201364.  He played a total of 47 times for the club, scoring 10 goals."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.
