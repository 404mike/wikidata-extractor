Born in the village of Chopwell in County Durham, Waugh began his career as an amateur with Durham City before spending a brief spell representing his home town club of Chopwell Colliery at  the start of 1921.It was while at Chopwell that Waugh was spotted by Football League club Sheffield United who signed both Waugh and fellow defender Bill Sampy for a joint fee of \u00a3250 in April 1921. Waugh made a slow start to his career with the Blades and did not begin to feature regularly until November 1922, from which point he missed only one of the following 103 first team matches. Waugh was considered to lack pace and this caused him problems from 1925 when the offside rule was changed.  A neck injury prevented Waugh from playing in the 1925 FA Cup Final and after a run of games at the start of the 1925\u201326 season he lost his place in the side to Seth King. Despite being selected for the FA tour of Canada in the summer of 1926, Waugh was unable to reclaim his place in United's starting eleven and was eventually transferred to Darlington in January 1927 after having made 143 appearances for the Blades and scored three goals.A success at his new club, Waugh was a regular member of the match day team until 1933, including being ever present during the 1929\u201330 season. Waugh was part of the coaching staff at Darlington for much of his time there and took up a full-time coaching position once he retired from playing. With his career nearing an end, Sheffield United played a benefit match for Waugh in April 1932 and he later returned to the club to act as a scout from 1934.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Waugh", "response": ["*Jimmy Waugh (1898\u20131968)), British footballer"]}, {"page": "Seth King", "response": ["King made a slow start to his United career, spending two seasons in the reserves and not making his first team debut until 1922, after which he played intermittently for the following two seasons as cover when first team regulars were injured.  It was not until established centre back Jimmy Waugh suffered a serious injury in December 1924 that King was given the opportunity to make regular starts. King became a mainstay of the defence for the next three years and played for United at Wembley when they won the 1925 FA Cup Final."]}, {"page": "1926 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|Centre half|| Jimmy Waugh||Sheffield United"]}, {"page": "Bill Sampy", "response": ["Sampy was playing for local side Chopwell Colliery when he was signed by league side Sheffield United in May 1921. United paid \u00a3250 for the services of Sampy and teammate Jimmy Waugh, but whereas Waugh went on to become a regular in the first team, Sampy was largely seen as a reserve and did not make his league debut until October 1924 in an away match against Bury. Occasionally featuring in the league from that point on, Sampy did not get a consistent run in the side until the 1925\u201326 season."]}, {"page": "Billy Robinson (English footballer)", "response": ["Robinson spent six seasons with home-town club Darlington, and contributed to their promotion to the Second Division in 1925. In the club's second season at that level, he lost his place to Jimmy Waugh, the club's then record signing. When Robinson moved on to Southend United at the end of the season, after Darlington had been relegated back to the Third Division North, the Daily Express reported that he \"was thought to be unlucky to lose his place in the 'Quakers' side when Waugh was signed from Sheffield United and yet failed to save Darlington from relegation.\" He played little senior football after leaving Darlington."]}, {"page": "Jim Tinnion", "response": ["He played non-league football for Lintz Colliery before joining Darlington of the Third Division North on amateur forms in 1927\u201328. He turned professional at the end of that season, but made only one senior appearance, replacing regular centre-half Jimmy Waugh for the league visit to Doncaster Rovers on 29 March 1929, which Darlington lost 3\u20131. In May 1929, Tinnion and team-mate Reg Mountford signed for First Division club Huddersfield Town. The Athletic News noted in its season preview that \"with three centre half-backs on the books\u00a0... there should be ample choice for that position\", and the competition proved too much. Without making a single first-team appearance, Tinnion departed Huddersfield on a free transfer, and signed for North Shields of the North-Eastern League."]}]}}
