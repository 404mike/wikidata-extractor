He started his career with Cliftonville well, making his debut against Larne in July 2005 and winning the Player of the Month award two months later. Although he was injured for most of the 2006\u201307 season, he still managed to score three goals.\nCleary went out on loan to Armagh City at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season, but returned later in the season as Cliftonville challenged for the Irish Premier League title. However, in July 2008 he was told to leave the club following \"a breach of club discipline\".In September 2008 he moved to Larne. In August 2013 he joined Crusaders, scoring once in six appearances before his release later that season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "\u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh", "response": ["* Sean Cleary (footballer) (born 1983), Irish football player", "* Sean Cleary, Irish rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "Cleary (surname)", "response": ["*Sean Cleary (footballer) (born 1983), Irish football player", "*Sean Cleary (rugby league), Irish rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "Sean Cleary", "response": ["Sean Cleary may refer to:", "* Sean Cleary (footballer) (born 1983), Irish football player", "* Sean Cleary (rugby league), Irish rugby league footballer"]}]}}
