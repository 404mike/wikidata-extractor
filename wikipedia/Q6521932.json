He went on to manage non-league clubs Holbeach United and King's Lynn and league clubs Rochdale and Darlington.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rochdale A.F.C.", "response": ["The club's first promotion came in 1969, earned by a team largely assembled by manager Bob Stokoe, though it was Stokoe's assistant, Len Richley who steered Rochdale to promotion after Stokoe moved to Carlisle United. In the early stages of the 1969\u201370 season, Rochdale topped the Third Division table, sparking hopes of a second successive promotion. The team's form significantly declined around Christmas 1969, however, and a failure to halt the team's decline led to the dismissal of Richley. He was succeeded by Dick Conner, who stabilised the club's form and steered them to a 9th-place finish. The following three seasons saw the club finish in the lower reaches of the Third Division table, narrowly avoiding relegation each time. The board viewed merely surviving in the Third Division as unacceptable and replaced Conner with Walter Joyce for the 1973\u201374 season. This move failed to pay off, and Rochdale was relegated after a campaign in which they won only 2 of 46 league games."]}]}}
