During the 2007\u201308 season the club enjoyed a good run in the Football League Trophy and on 4 March 2008 Grimsby booked their place at the new Wembley Stadium after beating Morecambe in a two-legged Northern Final. A Paul Bolland goal in the away first leg was enough to see Town through. They went on to play MK Dons in the Final on 30 March, losing 2\u20130 after Danny Boshell missed an early penalty. The season ended with eight straight defeats. After a 13\u2013game winless streak in the league stretching from 22 March 2008, on 15 September 2008 Alan Buckley was sacked as manager for a second time. The board appointed Mike Newell as manager. The Mariners would finish 22nd in League Two narrowly avoiding relegation on the final day. Following another slow start to the season, and despite previous backings from the Grimsby Town board, on 18 October 2009 the club's official website declared they had sacked Mike Newell due to \"irretrievable breakdown\". Neil Woods was controversially made permanent manager on 23 November 2009. The other main candidate for the job was former boss Russell Slade, but the board decided upon Woods ahead of Slade. Almost immediately Woods was dealt a blow when the club decided to do a U-turn and sell captain Ryan Bennett to Peterborough United for \u00a3500,000 despite rejecting this offer in the summer and the player only recently signing a new four-year deal. Grimsby under Woods struggled and despite winning four and drawing one of their last six games to give them a chance of league survival going into the last game of the season., they were defeated 3\u20130 by Burton Albion, and thus were relegated from the Football League for the first time in nearly 100 years."]}, {"page": "St Bede's Grammar School", "response": ["*Paul Bolland, footballer"]}, {"page": "Jean-Paul Kalala", "response": ["Kalala joined Swansea City on trial and played in several pre-season games, but wasn't offered a deal by Kenny Jackett who admitted the midfielder wasn't the type of player he was looking for.

He did notably appear for The Mariners in their 1\u20130 League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Barwick found it hard to settle at Grimsby and some fans had given him a tough time over the fact he was a former player of rival club Scunthorpe, and the fact his performances were average never helped his cause. This in turn allowed Slade to loan him too Conference National side York City in November 2005. where he made three appearances. Barwick returned to Grimsby in January 2006 but continued to struggle in terms of gaining any run in the first team. The Mariners started the 2006\u201307 season under different command, when Russell Slade left the club, and in stepped his assistant Graham Rodger. As far as first team chances went, there was no difference .It was clear from as early as pre-season that Barwick was not among the plans of the new manager and he was transfer listed.

Fowler went on to make 19 appearances in all competitions during his loan spell in West Yorkshire, and on 13 November 2003 he was released from his Coventry contract thus allowing him to join with Huddersfield on a permanent basis. Fowler would go on to make a further 19 appearances for Town following his switch, scoring no goals, but collecting a tally of 8 yellow cards, and 2 red cards during his season. Huddersfield qualified for the play-offs, but Fowler was uninvolved for the semi final legs over Lincoln City, however Town progressed and Fowler came on as an 85th-minute substitute for Jonathan Worthington in the final at the Millennium Stadium against Mansfield Town. However the game has gone to extra time and then penalties meaning Fowler would have a full 35 minutes on the field, including scoring the winning penalty that earned his club promotion to League One. The following season Fowler played a cameo role in the club's 2004\u201305 season, and finished the campaign having featured 23 times in all competitions, scoring one with a further 4 yellow cards and 1 red card to add to his disciplinary tally. In June 2005 he joined Grimsby Town on trial along with a handful of other players hoping to earn a contract at Blundell Park. However, despite playing in 4 pre-season friendlies, as well as joining the Grimsby squad in a pre-season Army training camp, Fowler was snubbed a full-time contract with boss Russell Slade signing Ciaran Toner, Paul Bolland and Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala to play in Fowler's central midfield role.

In his first season with Grimsby Toner initially found it hard to break up Slade's favoured central midfield role of Paul Bolland and Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala. It wasn't until Kalala joined up with the DR Congo international side for the African Nations Cup midway through the 2005\u201306 season that Toner began to find his feet in the first team. Toner, however, would eventually lose his place again when Slade signed Curtis Woodhouse in the January transfer window. Grimsby would go on to defeat former side Lincoln City in the Play-off semi-finals before finally losing out in the final at the Millennium Stadium to Cheltenham Town, Toner however was an unused substitute in the final. In his second season at Blundell Park, Toner finished joint top scorer with eight goals, as he played a large part in keeping Alan Buckley's side in the Football League. Toner was rewarded and signed a new two-year deal in the summer of 2007. On 26 June 2008 it was confirmed that Toner would leave the club after agreeing with the club to cancel his contract, despite having one year remaining on the deal.
