He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 2002.Sambles is currently Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Exeter, he has a long and distinguished career researching the interaction of light with matter. His group at Exeter have studied a wide range of systems including: liquid crystal devices; iridescent butterfly wings; surface plasmons and microwave photonics. These studies have applications in liquid crystal displays for televisions and computer displays, highly sensitive detection of materials (e.g. for medical diagnosis), and optical and microwave communication.\nIn 2008, he was appointed to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.Sambles was knighted in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to scientific research and outreach.He had 3 children with his wife Sandy Sambles, they had Nena Sambles now (Nena Yendell) Ivan Sambles and Gavin Sambles. They now have 4 grandchildren. Ivan and his wife had Libby and Anna Sambles, Nena and her husband had Matthew and Daniel Yendell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Unimolecular rectifier", "response": ["This proposal was verified in two papers in 1990 and 1993 by the groups of John Roy Sambles (University of Exeter, UK) and Geoffrey Joseph Ashwell (Cranfield University now at the Lancaster University, UK), using a monolayer of hexadecylquinolinium tricyanoquinodimethanide sandwiched between dissimilar metal electrodes (magnesium and platinum) and then confirmed in three papers in 1997 and 2001 by Metzger (now at the University of Alabama) and coworkers, who used identical metals (first aluminium, then gold)."]}, {"page": "Institute of Physics Michael Faraday Medal and Prize", "response": ["*2012 Roy Sambles, \"For his pioneering research in experimental condensed matter physics\""]}, {"page": "List of University of Exeter people", "response": ["*Roy Sambles, Physics"]}, {"page": "List of Cornish scientists", "response": ["*Roy Sambles, physicistElston, S. & Sambles, R.
