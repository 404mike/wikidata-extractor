After spending some years in South and Central America, he moved to Salford, Lancashire in 1840 to establish a cotton business with his brother, George. Langworthy Brothers and Company was established at Greengate Mills.When Salford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1844, Langworthy was elected as the first alderman for Trinity ward. He was the borough's fifth mayor, elected for two consecutive terms from 1848 to 1850. His term as mayor saw the establishment of the free public museum and library at Peel ParkIn January 1857, Salford's Liberal Member of Parliament, Joseph Brotherton, died. Langworthy was selected as the party's candidate for the vacancy, and as the only nominee, was elected unopposed on 2 February. Following his election he gave a speech outlining his political views: he supported the temperance movement, free trade and civil and religious freedom, the reform of parliament, strengthened local government, but opposed any increase in the size of the country's armed forces. He was only Salford's MP for a matter of months, as he did not stand at the subsequent general election later in the year.\nLangworthy retained his connection with Salford Corporation, and on his death in 1874 left \u00a310,000 to the museum and library he had helped establish. Langworthy Road, constructed shortly after his death, was named in his memory by Salford Borough Council.", "link_mentions": {}}}
