He is only willing to help when it benefits him personally, and is more than willing to betray his allies and fight against them when it suits him. However, as of the end of the third game, he mostly reforms and devotes himself to making up for his crimes, though his cowardly personality remains unchanged.

Originally an organic humanoid with an abnormally-large head, Dr. Nefarious first appeared in a comic where, angry and embittered against those who had belittled him for his deformed appearance, he created an army of mutant Amoeboids to infest and destroy Blackwater City on planet Rilgar. After fending off the Amoeboids, superhero Captain Qwark traced Nefarious to a secret robot factory on planet Magmos and confronted the villain. Upon meeting him, Qwark recognized Nefarious as one of the students he bullied and humiliated in high school. Qwark then attempted to give Nefarious a wedgie \"for old times' sake\", but instead accidentally knocked the doctor off a catwalk and into the machinery below, which ultimately led to his transformation into a robot. Driven insane by the experience, Nefarious soon resurfaced and unleashed a swarm of robotic insects on the city of Metropolis on planet Kerwan to get revenge on Qwark, who confronted and defeated him again; Nefarious' body was badly damaged and all that was left of the villain was his disembodied head, which Qwark dumped in a trash can intending to get rid of him for good. Qwark was subsequently knocked out by Nefarious' butler, Lawrence, and taken to the former's ice planet lab. Qwark managed to escape while Nefarious began planning his vendetta while his body was repaired; however, the hasty repairs left Nefarious with a habit of malfunctioning in times of extreme stress (during which he freezes up and receives random radio signals of a holo-vision soap opera series, Lance and Janice, in his head) until being whacked by Lawrence or any of his allies.", "In Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, Dr. Nefarious resurfaces once again, this time forming an alliance with a race of primitive aliens called Tyhrranoids and arming them with advanced technology and even secretly recruiting the robot popstar sensation Courtney Gears to put subliminal anti-organic messages in her videos. He then started a campaign to exterminate all organic lifeforms in the Solana Galaxy planet by planet. Nefarious then creates and unleashes the \"Biobliterator\", a superweapon that turns all organic lifeforms into robots so that he can unify the galaxy under his \"benevolent, iron-fisted rule\" and usher in the new \"Age of Robots\". He also attempts to convince Clank to join his cause, being a big fan of the small robot's appearances in the \"Secret Agent Clank\" holo-vision show, of which he owns a copy of every episode as he mistakingly believes that the show is real. When Clank refuses, Nefarious captures and replaces him with a look-alike doppelg\u00e4nger whom he names Klunk. Eventually, Ratchet defeats Klunk and rescues Clank. The duo travel to planet Koros and destroys the first Biobliterator with an ion cannon. Nefarious then reveals he has a secondary Biobliterator ready and waiting on planet Mylon; this one is capable of transforming into giant robot which Nefarious himself pilots. Ratchet and Clank manage to destroy it with the aid of Captain Qwark, forcing Nefarious and Lawrence to teleport away to safety. In his haste to avoid getting blown up, however, Nefarious fails to specify an exact destination and they both end up stranded on a drifting asteroid in deep space for between \"5 or 10,000 years,\" as Lawrence puts it, until they can come within range of another planet.", "Two years later (when the game takes place), Nefarious moves from his fortress to a large space station crafted in the image of his head and begins a campaign to terrorize the Polaris Galaxy into submitting to his rule with aid from the mercenary Lord Vorselon and the robotic Valkyries.

After Clank opens the Orvus Chamber, Lawrence knocks him out and reports the news to Nefarious.

With \"help\" from Captain Qwark, Ratchet and Clank reunite and infiltrate Nefarious' space station to destroy his fleet of ships, but are then captured and brought before Nefarious. After explaining the full extent of his plans, Nefarious ejects the two heroes with his \"Asteroid Flinger 5000\" (installed in the case that he needs an ironic death scenario for his enemies).
