Port Vale tried to hire him after sacking Roy Sproson in October 1977, but he rejected their terms. He was appointed as manager of Newcastle United the following month, after Richard Dinnis's brief and unsuccessful reign at St James' Park. He gave Kenny Wharton his first professional contract, who would go on to play for the club for eleven years. He also signed Peter Withe, Alan Shoulder, and Bobby Shinton. He could not stop the \"Magpies\" suffering relegation out of the First Division in the 1977\u201378 season. He could only take United to two mid-table finishes in the Second Division in 1978\u201379 and 1979\u201380, before he was fired just weeks into the 1980\u201381 season after his team were knocked out of the League Cup by Third Division club Bury.
