Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor. The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs.

It is also revealed that the race was excluded from the Last Great Time War of the revived series' backstory. In \"Turn Left\" (2008), the same events are depicted in a parallel universe, where Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) describes their plan as foiled by Torchwood (characters from the spin-off show of that name), at the cost of their lives, with Torchwood leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) being captured by the Sontarans. In \"The Stolen Earth\" (2008), UNIT is revealed to have developed a teleportation device based on Sontaran technology.

In the first series of the revived programme, the Cybermen do not appear except for the inactive head of one, which is seen in a private museum of alien artefacts on Earth in the episode \"Dalek\". For Series 2 in 2006, Cybermen were reintroduced with a new origin story set in a parallel universe. In the \"Rise of the Cybermen\" and \"The Age of Steel\" two-part story, the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companions, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), crash land in a parallel London where the Cybermen are being created on modern-day Earth. The Cybermen are created by the owner of Cybus Industries, the dying transhumanist mad scientist John Lumic (Roger Lloyd-Pack). Lumic's Cybermen successfully convert much of the world's population by placing their human brains into robotic shells. The Doctor and his friends free London from their control. A human resistance group, the Preachers, then sets about to clean up the remainder of Lumic's factories around the world. The Cybermen reappear in the 2006 two-part finale \"Army of Ghosts\" and \"Doomsday\", exploiting a breach between universes to invade the Doctor's Earth. This breach is caused by a transport device belonging to the Daleks, who reveal themselves and trigger all-out war between the two species. The Doctor ultimately re-opens the breach, causing the Cybermen and all but a few Daleks to become trapped inside before it is re-sealed. Cybermen next appear in the 2008 Doctor Who Christmas special \"The Next Doctor\", emerging in 1851 London after the Daleks damaged the walls of reality in the previous episode, \"Journey's End\".

When he creates characters, he initially assigns a character a name and fits attributes around it. In the case of Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in his inaugural series of Doctor Who, he chose the name because he considered it a \"good luck charm\" after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. He presented his desire to make the show \"essentially British\" as another justification: he considered Rose to be \"the most British name in the world\" and feminine enough to subvert the then-current trend of female companions and their \"boyish\" names, such as Benny, Charley, and Ace. While he was writing for The Grand, the executive producer requested that he change the female lead character's name, a decision that led to the \"character never [feeling] right from that moment on\". The surname \"Harkness\", most notably given to Torchwood lead Captain Jack Harkness, is a similar charm, first used in 1993 for the Harkness family in Century Falls, and ultimately derived from the Marvel Universe supporting character Agatha Harkness, and the surname \"Tyler\" is similarly used because of his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced."]}, {"page": "The Calcium Kid", "response": ["The Calcium Kid is a British mockumentary comedy film which was released in 2004.
