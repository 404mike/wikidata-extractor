On 7 December 1781, at age 13, he joined the Bombay Marine as a midshipman on the Bombay. On 6 February 1793, he sailed from Calcutta on a private trading voyage with two chartered ships, the Duke of Clarence of 250 tons (bm) and 14 guns and the Duchess, an armed snow of 100 tons (bm). The goal was to collect nutmeg from New Guinea. However, on passing Timor, due to adverse winds he decided to navigate around the south coast of Australia and resupply with wood and water at Adventure Bay in Tasmania.He spent some time exploring the area of the River Derwent, unaware that it had already been charted by Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux. He (re)named many geographic features, generally using the names of officers in the East India Company or his shipmates. Some of these names survive to the present day, including the River Derwent itself and Risdon Cove.Leaving Tasmania on 9 June, he arrived at New Caledonia on 28 June and explored the coast until leaving for New Guinea on 3 July. He was the first European to land on Rossel Island.He died in the Coco Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, while en route to Calcutta, aged 63. His only son, Captain Fletcher Fulton Compton Hayes, was killed in Awadh during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "River Derwent (Tasmania)", "response": ["The upper part of the river was named after the River Derwent, Cumbria by British Commodore John Hayes who explored it in 1793.

The first European to chart the river was Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, who named it the Rivi\u00e8re du Nord in 1793.

In the course of this voyage Bass visited the estuary of the Derwent River, found and named by Captain John Hayes in 1793, where the city of Hobart would be founded on the strength of his report in 1803. When the two returned to Sydney, Flinders recommended to Governor John Hunter that the passage between Van Diemen's Land and the mainland be called Bass Strait."]}, {"page": "Mount Wellington (Tasmania)", "response": ["No other Europeans visited Tasmania until the late eighteenth century, when several visited southern Tasmania (then referred to as Van Diemens Land) including Frenchman Marion du Fresne (1772), Englishmen Tobias Furneaux (1773), James Cook (1777) and William Bligh (1788 and 1792), and Frenchman Bruni d'Entrecasteaux (1792\u201393). In 1793 Commodore John Hayes arrived at the Derwent River, naming the mountain Skiddaw, after the mountain in the Lake District, although this name never gained popularity.", "In 1798 Matthew Flinders and George Bass circumnavigated the island. Whilst they were resting in the area Flinders named the river the Derwent River (the name John Hayes had given only to the upper part of the river), Flinders referred to the mountain as 'Table Mountain' (the name given to it by Bond and Bligh \u2013 young Matthew Flinders was with them in 1791) for its similarity in appearance to Table Mountain in South Africa. Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's men were the first European to sail up the river and chart it. Later Nicholas Baudin led another French expedition in 1802, and whilst sheltering in the Derwent River (which they referred to as 'River du Nord' \u2013 the name d'Entrecasteaux had given to it) Baudin also referred to the mountain as 'Montagne du Plateau' (also named by d'Entrecasteaux). However, the British first settled in the Hobart area in 1804, resulting in Flinders' name of 'Table Mountain' becoming more popular. Table Mountain remained its common name until in 1832 it was decided to rename the mountain in honour of the Duke of Wellington who, with Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher finally defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in present-day Belgium on 18 June 1815."]}, {"page": "John Hayes", "response": ["John Hayes may refer to:", "*John Hayes (director) (1930\u20132000), American director of low-budget films", "*John Hayes (radio), American radio executive", "*John Hayes (1643\u20131705), MP for Winchelsea", "*John Hayes (Australian politician) (1868\u20131956), Australian politician, Premier of Tasmania, 1922\u20131923", "*John Hayes (British politician) (born 1958), British politician and MP", "*Se\u00e1n Hayes (Cork politician) (otherwise known as John Hayes, died 1941), Sinn F\u00e9in member of the 1st D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, and the 2nd and 3rd", "*John Hayes (New Zealand politician) (born 1948), New Zealand diplomat and politician", "*John Hayes (Queensland politician) (1897\u20131986), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*John Hayes (explorer) (1768\u20131831), of the British East India Company", "*John Hayes (Royal Navy officer) (1767/1775\u20131838), Royal Navy admiral", "*Sir John Hayes, 1st Baronet (c. 1750\u20131809), military physician", "*John Hayes (sailor) (1832\u20131911), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Hayes (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131977), Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy", "*John Hayes (footballer, born 1936), Australian rules footballer for St Kilda", "*John Hayes (footballer, born 1939), Australian rules footballer, former Fitzroy VFL captain", "*John Hayes (cricketer) (1927\u20132007), New Zealand Test cricketer", "*John Hayes (harness racer) (1919\u20131998), harness racing driver/trainer/owner", "*John Hayes (rugby union) (born 1973), Irish prop forward", "*John Hayes (rugby league) (born 1939), Australian rugby league footballer", "*John Hayes (Gaelic footballer), Irish Gaelic football player", "*John Hayes (soccer) (born 1960), U.S. soccer player", "*John Hayes (tennis) (born 1955), American tennis player, who was on the tour in the early 1980s", "*John Hayes (baseball) (1855\u20131904), baseball player", "*John Hayes (1685\u20131726), killed by his wife Catherine Hayes (murderer); tried for the murder and executed by burning at the stake.", "*John Hayes (painter) (1786?\u20131866), British portrait artist", "*John Hayes (art historian) (1929\u20132005), British art historian and museum director, expert on Gainsborough", "*John Hayes, co-founder of software publisher Peachtree Accounting"]}, {"page": "History of Tasmania", "response": ["* 1793: John Hayes, of British East India Company, unaware of the French visit, sails up the river, which he names Derwent"]}, {"page": "Risdon Cove", "response": ["Risdon Cove is a cove located on the east bank of the Derwent River, approximately  north of Hobart, Tasmania.
