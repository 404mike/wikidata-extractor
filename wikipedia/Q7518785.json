He bowled right-arm medium-fast and batted right-handed. He made his first-class debut for Hampshire in 1997, making a handful of appearances for the county until he moved to Somerset for the 2002 season. However, appearances for the first XI became less frequent and Francis was released at the end of the 2006 season. He was signed by Nottinghamshire early in the 2007 season, which proved to be his final year in professional cricket.\nFrancis also toured with England A in India in 2003-04 and appeared in one Youth One-Day International, coming in January 1997 on the England Under-19s' tour of Pakistan.
