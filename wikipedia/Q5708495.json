Sak\u0101 and Skuthai evidently constituted a generic name for the nomads on the northern frontiers.\"  Persian sources often treat them as a single tribe called the Saka (Sakai or Sakas), but Greek and Latin texts suggest that the Scythians were composed of many sub-groups.Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland-page-323"]}, {"page": "John Cook", "response": ["* John Manuel Cook (1910\u20131994), British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Cebrene", "response": ["A rare series of bronze coins display the obverse and reverse types of Cebren (ram's head/head of Apollo), but bear the legend  (Antioche\u014dn, '(coin of the) Antiocheis'). On the basis of these coins it has been argued, most notably by the French epigrapher Louis Robert, that Cebren was refounded by Antiochus I Soter as Antiocheia in the Troad following Antiochus' victory over Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BCE, after which most of western Asia Minor came under his control. Moreover, Robert noted that some of these coins bore the letters B and K and included a club beside the ram's head: since the club is the typical symbol of the coinage of Birytis, an unlocated city in the Troad, Robert argued that these letters referred to B(irytis) and K(ebren) and were evidence of a synoecism or sympoliteia between the two communities which had produced the new foundation of Antiocheia in the Troad.Robert (1951) 16-31. Robert cites two further documents which he thinks proves the continued existence of Cebren in the early 2nd century BCE: the Theorodokoi lists of Delphi (Plassart (1921) 8, lines 20-1) and an inscription from Assos (Merkelbach (1976) no. 4). Cook (1973) 342-3 shows that Cebren is an incorrect restoration in the Theorodokoi list, which in any case date to the 230s or 220s, while the most recent editor dates the inscription from Assos to ca. 330-310 BCE. Robert's arguments have been repeatedly criticized by the archaeologist John Manuel Cook, who could discern no archaeological or numismatic evidence for occupation in the Hellenistic period at the site of \u00c7al Da\u011f.Cook (1973) 338-44, (1988). Cook based these claims on only two days of surface survey at \u00c7al Da\u011f, and as such definitive answers regarding the settlement history of the site in the 3rd century BCE will have to await a full excavation.Cook (1973) 6, 339."]}, {"page": "Robert Manuel Cook", "response": ["In 1938, Cook married Kathleen Porter (d.1979).
