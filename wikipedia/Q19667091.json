Murray said that \"the possibility of it being more of a project than a job, that\u2019s what pulled me to it\". Boston went on to finish the 2016\u201317 season in 15th-place and Murray released four players in the summer. In April 2017 he told the media that he was planning to move the club's training base. He said that there was an \"unbelievable\" number of players eager to join the club, with summer signings including goalkeeper George Willis; defenders Bradley Beatson, James Clifton, Jack Cowgill, Taron Hare and Jordan Keane; midfielder Jamie McGuire; and forwards Ashley Hemmings, Pearson Mwanyongo, Kabongo Tshimanga and Tyrell Waite. He compared his team to a baby deer after a difficult start to the new season, stating that \"they\u2019re a little bit wobbly when they\u2019re born\", whilst also saying that \"[recruitment has] not been good enough and we take ultimate responsibility for that\". On 28 October 2017, Murray left his position as manager of Boston United after a run of one win in 11 games left the club in the bottom two. Upon departing York Street, he said that \"they need a shot of confidence and a centre forward, everything else is in place\"; the \"Pilgrims\" went on to finish the 2017\u201318 season in ninth-place. He later admitted it had been a mistake to take the Boston job."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["After the failed transfer of Wright, Yeovil moved to sign young Tottenham Hotspur striker Shayon Harrison on loan until the end of the season.
