Tamba serves as the programme's naive child; the programme's educational content is introduced as the presenters explain things to Tamba. Whilst Tamba appears in every episode, a team of presenters take it in turns to pair-up in each show. These presenters include Justin Fletcher, Sarah-Jane Honeywell, Simon Davies, Lorna Laidlaw, Paul Ewing, Veejay Kaur (series 3\u20134), Toni Fruitin and Amit Sharma (both series 4 only) and Beverly Hills (series 1\u20132 only). Tamba is performed by puppeteers Sue Eves (series 1 to 4) who created the voice for Tamba; Alison McGowan (series 2 and 3) and Katherine Smee (series 4). Sue Eves has also written many scripts for the programme.", "Much of the show's format follows that of 1964\u20131988 UK children's programme Play School and later show Playdays. Tikkabilla presenter Simon Davies also presented Play School in its later years and Playdays in its early years and Justin Fletcher played Mr Jolly in the live stage show production of Playdays. In the Tikkabilla studio, which features a large, colourful house, the presenters and Tamba perform songs, tell stories, play games and make things. Occasionally, special guests visit, normally to demonstrate a special skill or performance. The iconic square, round and arched windows made famous by Play School are again used as a device to transport the viewer from the studio to the outside, real world. Location items, sometimes featuring the presenters and Tamba and usually including young children, introduce the wider world to the young audience."]}, {"page": "Corners (TV series)", "response": ["Corners is a BBC children's television series of the 1980s. Produced by Alison Stewart, the format of the programme was that viewers would submit questions and queries (usually general knowledge, but sometimes metaphysical or scientific), and the two hosts, Tracy BrabinBFI (later Sophie Aldred and then Diane-Louise Jordan) and Simon Davies, would try to answer the questions, aided by an anthopomorphised animal puppet, Jo Corner, who was performed and puppeteered by Robin Stevens (who later performed as Tom on Ragdoll's Tots TV). Being children's programming, the explanations used humour to convey information and frequently involved demonstrations which degenerated into slapstick humour.  Songs were also used.  A show with a similar format, \"Dear Mr. Barker\", aired on CBBC in the mid-1990s, but did not last long.", "One of the presenters of the show was Sophie Aldred, who later became famous for playing the role of Ace in the television series Doctor Who (in one segment prior to her involvement in Who, Aldred met Keff McCulloch to discover how the new Doctor Who theme tune was composed). The other was Simon Davies, whose career continues as a writer and performer."]}, {"page": "Simon Davies VIII", "response": ["#REDIRECT Simon Davies (Welsh TV presenter)"]}, {"page": "Simon Davies", "response": ["Simon Davies may refer to:", "*Simon Davies (privacy advocate), British advocate", "*Simon Davies (footballer, born 1974), Welsh international footballer (born in England), former Chester City F.C. manager", "*Simon Davies (footballer, born 1979), Welsh international footballer (born in Haverfordwest), whose clubs have included Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham", "*Simon Davies (English TV presenter) (born 1963), English designer, interior decorator and television presenter working in Sweden", "*Simon Davies (Welsh TV presenter) (born 1959), Welsh television presenter and former actor", "*Simon Davies (solicitor) (born 1967), British lawyer"]}, {"page": "Monster Caf\u00e9", "response": ["Skull voiced and puppeteered by Simon Davies"]}, {"page": "Megamaths", "response": ["The three remaining series, however, were set in a \"Superhero School\" space station, featuring a trainee superhero named Maths Man who was initially guided by a female tutor, Her Wholeness, in the fifth series, and later by a male tutor, His Wholeness, in the sixth and seventh series. In the fifth series, there were also recurring sketches of a quiz show named Find that Fraction hosted by Colin Cool (played by Simon Davies who co-wrote the second to fourth series with director Neil Ben and had played the King of Diamonds in all four Table Mountain series), and a sports show named Sports Stand hosted by Sue Harker (a spoof of Sue Barker, who was played by Liz Anson) and Harry Fraction (a spoof of Harry Gration, who was also played by Simon Davies), along with a supervillain named The Diddler who Maths Man had to solve mathematical problems caused by when he ventured down to Earth (in the final episode, she was revealed to actually be Her Wholeness in disguise).

In the seventh and final series, the episodes were shortened from twenty minutes to fifteen, and again featured Maths Man getting sent down to Earth to solve mathematical problems in everyday life."]}]}}
