Russia, Ukraine and Belarus did it themselves.\" Cross-checking with the leak of 4,000 Russian emails, believed to originate from Putin's senior adviser Vladislav Surkov, the Conservative MP Bob Seely, and the Ukrainian specialist Alya Shandra, have found that several of Milne's articles on the 2014\u20132015 Ukrainian crisis appear to parallel the Kremlin's agenda at the time.  Bullough questioned Milne's view of Russia in general, explaining he had himself lived in Russia for half a dozen years, and visited almost all the former Soviet bloc, adding that \"when I read what Milne writes about it, I slip into a parallel universe.\""]}, {"page": "Edward Stanford Travel Writing Awards", "response": ["* Oliver Bullough, The Last Man in Russia"]}]}}
