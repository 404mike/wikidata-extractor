However, under manager John McGlashan, the Red Lichties competed at the top of Division 3, finishing 4th in their first season and second in the next, reaching both divisional play-offs in seasons 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, although failing to gain promotion. They finished fourth in Division 3 and disposed of Cowdenbeath 2\u20131 on aggregate thanks to a late extra time winner from Robbie Raeside in the semifinal. Stranraer were the opponents in the play-off final and the Red Lichties ran out 2\u20130 winners in the home tie first leg at Gayfield Park thanks to a Robbie Raeside header and a Barry Sellars strike. At Stranraer, the Red Lichties goal was pummelled for much of the match and they spent much of the second half down to 10 men after Craig Tully had been red-carded. Although one goal was conceded, a resolute defence saw the Red Lichties hold on for a 2\u20131 aggregate win and promotion.", "During season 2009\u201310, results seemed to go into freefall after a 6\u20130 home defeat to St Johnstone in the Scottish League Cup early in the season. John McGlashan resigned to be replaced by Jim Weir who after a mixed start eventually rallied the Red Lichties to a spirited last few weeks of the season. With a win needed against East Fife to avoid the play-offs, the side threw everything they had in the last 20 minutes to find a winner but to no avail. After beating Queens Park in the play-off semifinal, their season ended with a 2\u20130 loss to Forfar Athletic in the final.
