The episode closes with a monologue led by Martine, where she states that people need to do better by unlearning their biases, with \"Freedom\" by Beyonc\u00e9 included as a score. Bryan felt connected to the writing of the episode and has stated that it angered her to read the script due to how accurate it was. She also stated that the Black actors featured would only appear in the episode if it was realistic, since they did not want to compromise the struggles they face.", "Martine attends an interview for the Businesswoman of the Year award with Patsy (Cassie Vallance), who tells her that she is late and to quicken up her answers due to supposed timekeeping issues. Patsy is abrupt with Martine and tells her that she is not unique compared to other \"diverse\" applicants. However, when interviewing Grace, she offers her a coffee and chats nicely with her. Martine arrives for her appointment early, and when Grace arrives, the two have an argument and Grace says they should take it outside. While they argue outside, nurse Peri Lomax (Ruby O'Donnell) realises they have been double booked. Grace cries, and Peri gives her the appointment out of sympathy. Martine disagrees with her decision but is labelled as aggressive by Peri for speaking out on the injustice. Martine receives an email from Patsy with interview questions and decides to reply with how she has been treated throughout the day as a Black woman. She describes Alan, Patsy, and Peri as problematic and states that people need to do better. She then calls Felix, telling him that she wants him and she will get him."]}]}}
