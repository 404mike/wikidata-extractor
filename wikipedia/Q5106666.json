SAHB produced a succession of highly regarded albums and tours throughout the 1970s. The band never achieved acclaim in the United States the way it did in Great Britain, but it had a cult following in certain US cities, especially Cleveland, where the group first played at the Agora Ballroom in December 1974. Thanks to airplay from WMMS, songs like \"Next\" and \"The Faith Healer\" became very popular. Cleveland remained a city where the Sensational Alex Harvey Band had a devoted following.
