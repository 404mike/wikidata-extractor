During a car chase scene, where the police are chasing Bond in a small parking lot, the Mustang was to jump a small ramp over several cars. The hired stunt driver they had couldn't perform this and wrecked two or three cars in the process. The stunt team had only one automobile left so they called Bill Hickman, who drove for hours to the location, jumped into the Mustang, and did the stunt in one take. A continuity mistake during the same car chase made it into the film's final cut: when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels through a narrow alley, the car enters the alley on its right side tires and exits driving on its left side."]}, {"page": "Wad\u014d-ry\u016b", "response": ["* Joe Robinson (actor)"]}, {"page": "Barabbas (1961 film)", "response": ["* Joe Robinson as Gladiator"]}, {"page": "The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll", "response": ["*Joe Robinson as Corinthian (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "A Kid for Two Farthings (film)", "response": ["* Joe Robinson as Sam"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["*Joe Robinson (Acting Diploma 1948)"]}, {"page": "Ronald Rich", "response": ["The actor and stuntman Joe Robinson coached Sean Connery in judo for the fight scene, and acted as double for Ronald Rich."]}, {"page": "From Russia with Love (film)", "response": ["Englishman Joe Robinson was a strong contender for the role of Red Grant but it was given to Robert Shaw."]}, {"page": "Ski Hi Lee", "response": ["After finishing his tour, Lee flew to the United Kingdom in 1962 to exchange his pay, which he had been given in sterling.

The alleyway car roll sequence is actually filmed in two locations. The entrance was at the car park at Universal Studios and the exit was at Fremont Street, Las Vegas.

Film crew members held a rope across the pool for her, with which she could lift her face out of the water to breathe between takes. The pool's sloping bottom made the block slip into deeper water with each take. Eventually, Wood was submerged but was noticed by on-lookers and rescued before drowning for real.
