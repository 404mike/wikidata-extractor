The remains consisted of a single partial wing bone broken into three pieces, which had been acquired by William Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen, and studied by Enniskillen and William Buckland, who both thought the bone came from a species of giant Cretaceous bird similar to an albatross. Owen agreed that it was a bird, and argued that it may either have been from an albatross sized bird (if it was a humerus) or a much larger bird (if it was a radius). On the latter possibility, Owen wrote that a bird of that size would have been reminiscent of the \"fabulous Roc of Arabian romance.\""]}, {"page": "Kildare Street Club", "response": ["*William Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen"]}, {"page": "James William Davis", "response": ["*Davis, J.W.
