This gave Philip control of the extensive Portuguese empire. When Philip left for Madrid in 1583, he made his nephew Albert of Austria his viceroy in Lisbon. In Madrid he established a Council of Portugal to advise him on Portuguese affairs, giving prominent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish courts, and allowing Portugal to maintain autonomous law, currency, and government.

However, Spanish exploration in the Pacific was paramount until the late 18th century. Spanish navigators discovered many islands including Guam, the Marianas, the Carolines and the Philippines in the North Pacific, as well as Tuvalu, the Marquesas, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Easter Island in the South Pacific.

These works focus on identifying and correcting what they argue are popular modern misconceptions about the inquisitions and historical misinterpretations of their activities. Kamen's 1997 book is updated and revised from an edition first published in 1965. Kamen takes the position that the Inquisition in Spain was motivated more by political considerations than religious, that the monarchs routinely protected those close to the crown, and that in Aragon large areas either defied or hindered its operation.Rust, Eric C., \"Review of The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision\", Journal of Church and State Vol. 41, Issue 2, p.  381 Eric Rust of Baylor University describes Kamen's work as \"historical revision at its best\".", "Henry Kamen has criticized the concept, \"Persistent employment of the [Black Legend] label for ideological ends in order to rebut any criticism of Spain's imperial record has made it both unsuitable to use and inaccurate.

As historian Henry Kamen notes, the \"so-called convivencia was always a relationship between unequals.\" Despite their legal inequality, there was a long tradition of Jewish service to the Crown of Aragon, and Jews occupied many important posts, both religious and political. Castile itself had an unofficial rabbi. Ferdinand's father John II named the Jewish Abiathar Crescas Court Astronomer.", "The category \"superstitions\" includes trials related to witchcraft. The witch-hunt in Spain had much less intensity than in other European countries (particularly France, Scotland, and Germany). One remarkable case was that of Logro\u00f1o, in which the witches of Zugarramurdi in Navarre were persecuted. During the auto-da-f\u00e9 that took place in Logro\u00f1o on 7 and 8 November 1610, six people were burned and another five burned in effigy.These trials are the theme of the film Akelarre, by the Spanish director Pedro Olea. The role of the Inquisition in cases of witchcraft was much more restricted than is commonly believed. Well after the foundation of the Inquisition, jurisdiction over sorcery and witchcraft remained in secular hands.Henry Kamen. The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision. 1999 In general the Inquisition maintained a skeptical attitude towards cases of witchcraft, considering it as a mere superstition without any basis. Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas, who took the Edict of Faith to various parts of Navarre after the trials of Logro\u00f1o, noted in his report to the Suprema that, \"There were neither witches nor bewitched in a village until they were talked and written about\".Cited in Henningsen, Gustav, ed. \"The Salazar Documents: Inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas and Others on the Basque Witch Persecution.\" Cultures, Beliefs, and Traditions: Medieval and Early Modern Peoples, Vol 21.

Kamen argued that the Inquisition was not nearly as cruel or as powerful as commonly believed. The book was very influential and largely responsible for subsequent studies in the 1970s to try to quantify (from archival records) the Inquisition's activities from 1480 to 1834.See for example Jean-Pierre Dedieu, Los Cuatro Tiempos, in Bartolom\u00e9 Benassar, Inquisici\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola: poder pol\u00edtico y control social, pp. 15\u201339 and  Those studies showed there was an initial burst of activity against conversos suspected of relapsing into Judaism, and a mid-16th century pursuit of Protestants, but the Inquisition served principally as a forum Spaniards occasionally used to humiliate and punish people they did not like: blasphemers, bigamists, foreigners and, in Aragon, homosexuals, and horse smugglers. Kamen went on to publish two more books in 1985 and 2006 that incorporated new findings, further supporting the view that the Inquisition was not as bad as once described by Lea and others.

The British Dictionary restricted itself to persons who were deceased, and the historian Henry Kamen has argued that it was a mistake for its Spanish equivalent to include living figures among entries. However, while there was criticism of entries for some living people (such as the politician Esperanza Aguirre), the main allegations of bias concern articles relating to Francoist Spain. A notable example was the entry on Francisco Franco, written by Luis Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez, in which Franco is defined as an autocratic head of state rather than a dictator.
