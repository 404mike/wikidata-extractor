This required fieldwork observation and data collection, from firms and workers in both the United States and Japan. Fieldwork data provided a way of verifying interpretations of large data sets and of the consistency of the data with observed behavior. In her work with Julia Lane using the Census LEHD data set, they demonstrated how rich field data combined with large survey data yield strong evidence for studying specific economic activities.", "As concern about globalization and US jobs grew, Brown teamed up with Tim Sturgeon and Julia Lane to develop a firm-based survey of global activities and employment in 2010. Brown expanded her research to include sustainability as global warming joined inequality as a challenge to economic policy, and this led to her development of Buddhist Economics as a field of study at UC Berkeley in 2011. Buddhist economics integrates global sustainability and shared prosperity to provide a holistic model of economic behavior and well-being. Her book Buddhist Economics: An enlightened approach to the dismal science will be published by Bloomsbury Press in February 2017.", "#\u201cJob Loss, Trade and Labor Markets: New Worker-Level Evidence\u201d (with Julia Lane and Tim Sturgeon), Industrial Relations (2012)"]}, {"page": "Laura McKenna", "response": ["served on the Committee on Privacy and Confidentiality of the American Statistical Association from 1994 to 1999.
