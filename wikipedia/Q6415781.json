After his death in 1842, the firm was reconstituted with the four sons of Kirkman and two Buchanan distant cousins. The partners agreed to continue the business with a view to liquidation but that strategy was never fully implemented. However, in 1843, the connection with the London branch was terminated and in 1844 the three cotton mills were advertised for sale. Only Ballindalloch found a buyer and the Company kept the other two. Losses were incurred in 1847 and 1848; by then John Finlay was the only son of Kirkman left in the firm, and non-family members had been brought in as partners. The first change in its fortunes came from one of the newer partners, James Clark, appointed in 1847, who proposed that he also become a partner in Wilson, James & Kay and a new company should manage their joint sales. Considerable sums had to be spent modernizing the Catrine and Deanston mills and the Indian agency business was revived.  In 1858 the Company formally merged with Wilson, James & Kay under the James Finlay name. James Clark held 30% of the shares with Messrs. Williams and Kay holding a further 45%. The remaining Finlay family director (John) and his cousin Archibald Buchanan held the final 25%: the Finlay family no longer controlled the Company.", "Like Kirkman Finlay before him, Sir John Muir\u2019s commercial achievements brought public recognition.
