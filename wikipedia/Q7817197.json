Preston took the lead, but two goals from Tom Pearson and one from Bill Paddock saw Albion reach the final for the second year running. In the final, the team faced local rivals Aston Villa at the Kennington Oval, to determine which side would be the first from the Midlands to win the FA Cup. Villa's goalkeeper Jimmy Warner made a number of saves in a goalless first 45 minutes, and it was they who took the lead in the second half when Dennis Hodgetts scored. Bob Roberts, Albion's goalkeeper, made no attempt to save the shot, wrongly assuming that Hodgetts was offside. Villa captain Archie Hunter added a second goal for Villa near the end as Albion again finished as runners-up.Willmore pp. 20\u201321."]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Tom Pearson"]}, {"page": "Thomas Pearson", "response": ["* Tom Pearson (footballer) (1866\u20131918), English footballer", "* Tom Pearson (rugby union, born 1872)  (1872\u20131957), Welsh rugby union player", "* Tom Pearson (rugby union, born 1926)  (1926\u20132010), Scottish rugby union player"]}, {"page": "1888 World Championship (football)", "response": ["|FW||  Tom Pearson"]}]}}
