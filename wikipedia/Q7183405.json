Direct British diplomacy in the Levant dated back to 1825, when the Levant Company ceased operations. The British Diplomatic Service traditionally consuls for the Levant from expatriate British citizens living in the region (particularly those in Constantinople). The 1858 Select Committee on Foreign Office recommended reforming diplomacy in the Levant so that only Britons would serve as consuls. In order to find qualified individuals, they urged the creation of a program that would examine British subjects, specifically their aptitude for language, train them in Constantinople, and eventually use them as interpreters. Concerns over expenses of the program and whether it could attract qualified applicants delayed establishment until urging by Lord Salisbury led Philip Currie, 1st Baron Currie, to create it. The specialized Levant Consular Service was created in 1877."]}]}}
