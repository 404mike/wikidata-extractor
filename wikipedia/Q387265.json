The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure and the club's finances were in a parlous state. This led to the club selling its top striker Tony Hateley to Chelsea for \u00a3100,000 in October 1966, without his goals Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967. The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked Tommy Cummings (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 100. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who brought in Doug Ellis as chairman. Doug Ellis's first managerial appointment was Tommy Docherty, who after initial success was sacked after 13 months in charge with the club at the foot of Second Division. His replacement was former club captain Vic Crowe, who could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history at the end of the 1969\u201370 season.

The team name was chosen based on its association with the Braves, which like the Chiefs also used Native American imagery in their branding. On September 8, Cecil made one of the first hires on the team with Phil Woosnam as head coach and player. Team tryouts were held on the campus of Emory University, which also housed the Chiefs' training facility. The initial roster included notable international players such as Vic Crowe, Peter McParland, and Vic Rouse. The Chiefs opened their first season with an away game against the Baltimore Bays on April 16, 1967. The game, a 1\u20130 loss for the Chiefs, is notable for being the first professional soccer match to be televised in the United States. Before the game, the players on both teams were introduced holding flags of the countries they were from, and a band played \"Dixie\" prior to kick-off. The Chiefs would finish their debut season with a win\u2013loss\u2013tie record of 10\u20139\u201312. Following the 1967 season, the NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association to form the North American Soccer League."]}, {"page": "Ray Graydon", "response": ["In July 1971, Graydon secured a \u00a350,000 move to Aston Villa, with captain Brian Godfrey also moving in the opposite direction. He missed just one of Villa's 46 league games in the 1971\u201372 season, scoring 14 goals as the club secured the Third Division title with a five-point margin over Brighton & Hove Albion. Derby County and Leeds United declined the chance to play in the 1972 FA Charity Shield, so Villa accepted the invitation to play Manchester City at Villa Park, losing the match 1\u20130 following a penalty from Francis Lee. Gradyon went on to score ten goals from 37 appearances during the 1972\u201373 campaign, helping Vic Crowe's side to a third-place finish in the Second Division.

They finished five places and five points off the promotion places in 1973\u201374, before finishing three places and eight points short of promotion in 1974\u201375. Johnny Giles was then appointed as manager at The Hawthorns in July 1975, and Brown finished as the club's top scorer in 1975\u201376 with ten goals, as Albion secured the third and final promotion place by a one-point margin. They then finished seventh in 1976\u201377.

Brown scored 18 goals in 41 appearances in 1978\u201379, playing up front with Laurie Cunningham and Cyrille Regis, as the \"Baggies\" posted a third-place finish, some nine points behind champions Liverpool.
