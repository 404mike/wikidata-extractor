He is now known for his paintings of balloon ascents.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Cocking", "response": ["On 24 July 1837, Cocking's parachute was gaily decorated by the Gardens' artist E. W. Cocks. At 7:35 pm, Cocking ascended hanging below the balloon, which was piloted by Green and Spencer. Cocking was in a basket which hung below the parachute which in turn hung below the basket of the balloon. Cocking had hoped to reach 8,000\u00a0feet (2,440\u00a0m), but the weight of the balloon coupled with that of the parachute and the three men slowed the ascent; at 5,000\u00a0feet (1,500\u00a0m) and with the balloon nearly over Greenwich, Green informed Cocking that he would be unable to rise any higher if the attempt was to be made in daylight. Faced with this information, Cocking released the parachute."]}]}}
