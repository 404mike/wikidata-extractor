It was originally a rocky knoll attached to the mainland by tidal mud flats. Development started in the Darling Harbour area in the 1810s when Governor Macquarie moved the colony's produce markets to the corner of George and Market Streets, Sydney. This brought with it the need to develop wharves nearby for transportation of goods. As a result, the growth of maritime trade in the area was extensive and included warehouses, stores and other trade buildings. By 1839 Edward Macarthur owned the entire Pyrmont area and subdivided a large portion of it along the waterfront. While many cottages developed there, industrialisation also occurred quickly, including iron works, flour mills and tin smelters. Among these were the Pyrmont works on Darling Island of the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company (HRSN)."]}, {"page": "Old Pyrmont Cottages", "response": ["The land on which the Old Pyrmont Cottages are sited was leased by Edward Macarthur to George Wigram Allen in 1854, but initially he did little with it. Then in the late 1870s Allen began sub-leasing the lots to various people who built cottages there in response to the stimulus provided by the establishment of CSR and the Saunders Quarries. Cross and Young (later Scott) Streets were laid out, named and numbered. By 1879 some of the Old Pyrmont Cottages were in existence and being taxed by council. The last of the five cottages to be built was No 8 Scott St, constructed in 1895. The timing and diversity of the cottages' construction suggests that sub-leaseholders were developing the properties individually. It is likely that the cottages were not built by landlords then rented to tenants. Instead tenants rented the land and built a modest cottage in \"vernacular\" styles with whatever materials and construction techniques were readily available and without council supervision. These tenants were followed by other tenants who lived in and continually adapted the buildings to suit their residential needs. This was a common practice in the inner city and elsewhere during the 19th century."]}, {"page": "Minnie Elizabeth Cawthorn", "response": ["In 1948 Cawthorn became the head of a school in Geelong. The school in Geelong had been named by Governor, Major General Edward Macarthur after Captain Matthew Flinders in 1856, but was now said to be \"dilapidated\" and \"a dumping ground\" for girls who would work in the mills as soon as they were fourteen. She took over from Frances Higgins and decided that the students should not just be trained for the mills and to be housewives but to be contributing citizens. The school was renamed the \"Matthew Flinders Girls School\", two new wings were built and the grounds were pristine. In 1950 the first students to sit the \"Girls' Leaving Certificate\" in Victoria were at this school."]}, {"page": "Christ Church, South Yarra", "response": ["The earliest history of the church and parish is complicated. In 1852 land was set aside for a parish district including what is now South Yarra. Community meetings were held in the Ayres Arms Hotel and the South Yarra Hotel (now the Arcadia), and early services were held in the nearby Presbyterian Sunday School. The first vicar was appointed in 1855. The church was dedicated as Christ Church in either late 1855 or early 1856. Construction of the church itself began in April 1856 following the laying of a foundation stone by Major General Edward Macarthur, and was sufficiently advanced by April 1857 for the first service to be held in it. It was enlarged in 1860. The church was consecrated in 1875 by Dr Thornton, Bishop of Ballarat. The tower and spire were built later: the foundation stone was laid in 1881 by Sir Henry Brougham Loch, the Governor of the colony. The spire was modelled on that of Salisbury Cathedral. The spire and south aisle were completed in 1886; the north aisle in 1887."]}]}}
