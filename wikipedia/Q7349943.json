He was an early performer (from 1927) in radio plays.  He came to prominence as Becket in the first production of T. S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral. He went on to Shakespearean roles and to direct. He played the title role in the first broadcast in 1941-42 of the radio drama The Man Born to Be King. \nHe also wrote criticism and essays, works on the theatre and biography.  He was a Roman Catholic convert, and biographer of Hilaire Belloc and Eric Gill. In the case of Gill, a personal friend, he suppressed material about Gill's sexual interests, which would come out only in the 1989 biography by Fiona MacCarthy.\nHe married the Welsh actress Evelyn Bowen, with whom he had a son; they separated in 1939.

For Othello he played Iago, with Richardson in the title role. Guthrie wanted to experiment with the theory that Iago's villainy is driven by a suppressed love for Othello. Olivier was willing to co-operate, but Richardson was not; audiences and most critics failed to spot the supposed motivation of Olivier's Iago, and Richardson's Othello seemed underpowered. After that comparative failure, the company had a success with Coriolanus starring Olivier in the title role.

In The Cruise of the \"Nona\" (1925), he mentions a \"profound thing\" that Manning said to him when he was just twenty years old: \"All human conflict is ultimately theological.\" What Manning meant, Belloc explains, is \"that all wars and revolutions, and all decisive struggles between parties of men arise from a difference in moral and transcendental doctrine.\"The Cruise of the \"Nona\". Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1958, p. 48.

Hence battle.\"The Cruise of the \"Nona\". Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 49.

He became a trenchant critic both of capitalismRaymond Williams, Culture and Society, p. 186: Belloc's argument is that capitalism as a system is breaking down, and that this is to be welcomed. A society in which a minority owns and controls the means of production, while the majority are reduced to proletarian status, is not only wrong but unstable. Belloc sees it breaking down in two ways \u2013 on the one hand into State action for welfare (which pure capitalism cannot embody); on the other hand into monopoly and the restraint of trade. There are only two alternatives to this system: socialism, which Belloc calls collectivism; and the redistribution of property on a significant scale, which Belloc calls distributivism. and of many aspects of socialism.Socialism and the Servile State: A Debate between Hilaire Belloc and J. Ramsay MacDonald, South West London Federation of the Independent Labour, 1911.", "In The Cruise of the Nona, Belloc reflected equivocally on the Dreyfus Affair after thirty years.I, for my part, pretend to no certain conclusion in the matter\u2026 Of my own intimate acquaintance who were on the spot [at Dreyfus' trial] and competent to judge, most were for the innocence of Dreyfus: but the rest, fully competent also, were and are, convinced of his guilt\u2026 There are in England to-day two Englishmen whose wide knowledge of Europe and especially of Paris, and the French tongue and society, enable them to judge. They are both close friends of mine. One is for, the other against\u2026 I believe that, when the passions have died down, the Dreyfus case will remain for history very much what the Diamond Necklace has remained, or the Tichborne case; that is, there will be a popular legend, intellectually worth nothing; and, for the historian, the task of criticising that legend, but hardly of solving the problem. Norman Rose's book The Cliveden Set (2000) asserts that Belloc 'was moved by a deep vein of hysterical anti-semitism'.In his 1922 book, The Jews, Belloc argued that \"the continued presence of the Jewish nation intermixed with other nations alien to it presents a permanent problem of the gravest character,\" and that the \"Catholic Church is the conservator of an age-long European tradition, and that tradition will never compromise with the fiction that a Jew can be other than a Jew. Wherever the Catholic Church has power, and in proportion to its power, the Jewish problem will be recognized to the full.\"Belloc, Hilaire, The Jews, London: Constable, 1922, 3\u20135, 209\u2013210.Robert Speaight cited a letter by Belloc in which he condemned Nesta Webster because of her accusations against \"the Jews\". In February 1924, Belloc wrote to an American Jewish friend regarding an anti-Semitic book by Webster. Webster had rejected Christianity, studied Eastern religions, accepted the supposed Hindu concept of the equality of all religions and was fascinated by theories of reincarnation and ancestral memory.Nesta Webster, Spacious Days, London and Bombay, 1950, pp. 103 and 172\u20135.
