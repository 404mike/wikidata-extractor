He was a prolific populariser of the work of others, rather than an undertaker of original research. He is remembered as co-author (mainly in association with his friend Edward Wedlake Brayley) of nine volumes in the series The Beauties of England and Wales (1801\u20131814); and as sole author of the Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain (9 vols, 1805\u20131814) and Cathedral Antiquities of England (14 vols, 1814\u20131835).\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
