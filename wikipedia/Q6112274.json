He replaced Jack Eastham as the club's regular left-back, and played 64 league games for the club from 1904 to 1907. He was an ever-present in the 1904\u201305 season, before he was replaced at left-back by Arthur Cowell by the 1905\u201306 campaign. He then signed with Chelsea for a \u00a3900 fee in October 1907, who had won promotion out of the Second Division in 1907, and would be appointed as Chelsea's captain. After maintaining their top-flight status in 1907\u201308 and 1908\u201309, the \"Pensioners\" were relegated in 1909\u201310. Cameron stayed at the club as they missed out on promotion by one place and two points in 1910\u201311, before he helped Chelsea to promotion as Second Division runners-up in 1911\u201312; they finished level on points with champions Derby County, who had a superior goal average. He then helped the club to finish one place above the relegation zone in 1912\u201313. He played a total of 179 league and 15 cup appearances for Chelsea."]}, {"page": "Victor Norbury", "response": ["Norbury was born in Bartley on the eastern edge of the New Forest. His youth football was played for the village team and later for Brockenhurst, from where he joined Southampton in 1905. Norbury spent most of his football career in the reserves, but made his debut for the first team as a replacement at left-back for Horace Glover away to Brentford on 29 September 1906. Norbury retained his place for the next match, in a 5\u20131 victory at home to Millwall. This was the \"Saints\" first win of the season (having managed only two draws in the first five matches); despite this, Norbury lost his place back to Glover and made only one further first-team appearance, taking over from Jack Eastham at right-back at home to Clapton Orient on 16 February 1907."]}, {"page": "Dan Gordon (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["Back at The Dell, Gordon added some valuable experience to a struggling side, generally acting as cover for Jack Eastham. After a further twelve League appearances, Gordon retired in 1912, returning to Scotland to live."]}, {"page": "Frank Grayer", "response": ["He spent his early years at The Dell playing in the reserves and it was not until two days before his 21st birthday, on 11 February 1911, that he eventually made his first-team debut in a Southern League match at Swindon Town, replacing Jack Eastham at right-back. Although he was a \"solid, reliable performer at full back with a good turn of speed\", he found first-team chances hard to come by, making only six appearances in his four years with the \"Saints\". The return of Dan Gordon in 1911 reduced his chances of regular football even further and in July 1912, the Saints accepted an offer of \u00a3100 from Liverpool of the Football League First Division."]}, {"page": "Arthur Coates (footballer)", "response": ["In 1910, he was spotted by former England international Arthur Chadwick, then manager of Southern League team Exeter City. After a season at Exeter, Coates moved along the south coast to join fellow Southern League team, Southampton as a replacement for right-back Jack Eastham who had just retired."]}, {"page": "Bill Clarke (footballer, born 1880)", "response": ["He made his Southampton debut in the opening match of the 1905\u201306 season, a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Brentford, retaining his place for the rest of the season, at the end of which the Saints finished as runners-up, five points behind champions Fulham. He continued to occupy the right-back position for the start of the 1906\u201307 season until late December, when he fell ill. He returned in mid-February but was only able to show glimpses of his previous form; after another eight matches he suffered a serious knee injury, losing his place to Jack Eastham. Although Clarke spent several months trying to regain his fitness, he eventually retired in October 1908 without returning to the first-team."]}]}}
