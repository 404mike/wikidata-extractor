Through his sister Anne who married Dr. Thomas Higgins, he was the uncle of Kevin O'Higgins and great-uncle of another Chief Justice, Tom O'Higgins. His  mother was \na sister of  Timothy Michael Healy, the first Governor-General of the Irish Free State, and Sullivan in turn married their daughter Maeve. He was called to the Bar in 1895.\nIn 1913, Sullivan married his cousin Maeve Healy, daughter of Timothy Healy. Maeve was an artist who painted the well-known portrait of her husband in his judicial robes. They had no children. His strongly nationalist background made him acceptable to the new Government of the Irish Free State as a member of the new judiciary and accordingly, in 1924, he was appointed President of the High Court; in 1936, on the death of Hugh Kennedy he was appointed Chief Justice of Ireland and served until he reached retirement age in 1946.\nHis most notable judgment was the upholding by the Supreme Court in 1940 of the Constitutionality of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill which allowed for indefinite detention of suspected IRA members. An apparently casual remark of Sullivan that he was giving judgment \"for the majority\" caused controversy and led to the Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland 1941 providing for a single judgment only in such cases. There was further controversy in the 1960s when an academic claimed that Sullivan had \"packed\" the Court in favour of the Government by persuading James Creed Meredith to step down in favour of Conor Maguire. The claim seems to be unfounded: Sullivan was a firm believer in judicial independence, and in any case by 1940 any political sympathies he had were with the Opposition, not the Government.His cousin Maurice Healy in his celebrated memoir \"The Old Munster Circuit\"  portrays  Timothy as a kindly, serious young man; Mr. Justice MacKenzie in his memoir \"Lawful Occasions\"  recalled the much older Sullivan, then Chief Justice, as  \"an old-fashioned Irish gentleman, quiet living\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936", "response": ["Unfortunately the speed with which the 1936 Act was passed also meant that some serious legal matters had been overlooked by the draughtsmen, touching on the top of the Irish legal hierarchy. In May 1937 these were covered by the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937. As the Governor-Generalship had not been actually abolished by the 1936 Act, this Act was required to validate the otherwise-unlawful appointment of the Chief Justice of Ireland Timothy Sullivan. Sullivan had in turn questionably appointed three High Court judges. The recent appointment of Patrick Lynch as the Attorney General of Ireland and even the pension of the outgoing Governor-General needed to be legalised."]}, {"page": "Presidential Commission (Ireland)", "response": ["|Timothy Sullivan"]}, {"page": "Ne Temere", "response": ["In common law jurisdictions the father, by what is called the principle of \"paternal supremacy\", has the right to decide the religious upbringing of all the children of the marriage.

It comprised four judges with experience of murder trials, chaired by the Chief Justice, Timothy Sullivan. The committee was precluded from considering abolition of the death penalty. It said the law was generally unproblematic, but recommended changes to the insanity defence and also making infanticide a separate crime from murder. The latter was effected by the Infanticide Act 1949. Since independence, all 13 death sentences for murder in such cases had been commuted. Se\u00e1n Mac Eoin, the Minister for Justice, said the new act was intended \"to eliminate all the terrible ritual of the black cap and the solemn words of the judge pronouncing sentence of death in those cases  ... where it is clear to the Court and to everybody, except perhaps the unfortunate accused, that the sentence will never be carried out.\"Infanticide Bill, 1949\u2014Second and Subsequent Stages Seanad \u00c9ireann debates - Vol.36 c.1472 - 7 July 1949 Even before 1949, most infanticides were convicted of manslaughter or concealment of birth rather than murder; conversely, a murder charge was still possible after 1949 (as in the 1984 Kerry Babies case).; "]}, {"page": "Category talk:Members of the Council of State (Ireland)", "response": ["| :Category:Presidents of the High Court (Ireland) || no such category (yet); there is a complete list at High Court (Ireland)#Presidents of the High Court Since 1924.
