In 1940\u201341, Nazimuddin broke away from the coalition led by Premier Fazlul Haq and decided to become a leader of the opposition, leading campaign against Haq's premiership and primarily focused on Bengali nationalism issues.  In 1943, Nazimuddin took over the government from Premier Haq when the latter was dismissed by the governor, John Herbert, amid controversies surrounding in his political campaigns. During this time, Nazimuddin played a crucial political role for the cause for the separate Muslim homeland, Pakistan. About his role, he was asked about the \"Pakistan question\" by British Governor Richard Casey in 1945 but he showed very little and no interests in discussing the existence of the movement and reportedly quoting: he did not know what Pakistan means and nobody in Muslim League knew.\""]}, {"page": "Bengal famine of 1943", "response": ["First, a \"denial of rice\" policy was carried out in three southern districts along the coast of the Bay of Bengal\u00a0\u2013 Bakarganj (or Barisal), Midnapore and Khulna\u00a0\u2013 that were expected to have surpluses of rice. John Herbert, the governor of Bengal, issued an urgent directive in late March 1942 immediately requiring stocks of paddy (unmilled rice) deemed surplus, and other food items, to be removed or destroyed in these districts. Official figures for the amounts impounded were relatively small and would have contributed only modestly to local scarcities. However, evidence that fraudulent, corrupt and coercive practices by the purchasing agents removed far more rice than officially recorded, not only from designated districts, but also in unauthorised areas, suggests a greater impact. Far more damaging were the policy's disturbing impact on regional market relationships and contribution to a sense of public alarm. Disruption of deeply intertwined relationships of trust and trade credit created an immediate freeze in informal lending. This credit freeze greatly restricted the flow of rice into trade.", "Beginning as early as December 1942, high-ranking government officials and military officers (including John Herbert, the Governor of Bengal; Viceroy Linlithgow; Leo\u00a0Amery the Secretary of State for India; General Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of British forces in India, and Admiral Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Commander of South-East Asia) began requesting food imports for India through government and military channels, but for months these requests were either rejected or reduced to a fraction of the original amount by Churchill's War Cabinet. The colony was also not permitted to spend its own sterling reserves, or even use its own ships, to import food. Although Viceroy Linlithgow appealed for imports from mid-December 1942, he did so on the understanding that the military would be given preference over civilians. The Secretary of State for India, Leo Amery, was on one side of a cycle of requests for food aid and subsequent refusals from the British War Cabinet that continued through 1943 and into 1944. Amery did not mention worsening conditions in the countryside, stressing that Calcutta's industries must be fed or its workers would return to the countryside. Rather than meeting this request, the UK promised a relatively small amount of wheat that was specifically intended for western India (that is, not for Bengal) in exchange for an increase in rice exports from Bengal to Ceylon."]}, {"page": "Bengal Presidency", "response": ["In the 1937 election, the Congress emerged as the single largest party but short of an absolute majority. The second-largest party was the Bengal Provincial Muslim League (BPML), followed in third place by the Krishak Praja Party. The BPML, Krishak Praja Party and independent legislators formed a coalition government. A. K. Fazlul Huq, a founder of the BPML who later broke away to form the Krishak Praja Party, was elected as parliamentary leader and prime minister. Huq pursued a policy of Hindu\u2013Muslim unity. His cabinet included leading Hindu and Muslim figures, including Nalini Ranjan Sarkar (finance), Bijoy Prasad Singha Roy (revenue), Maharaja Srish Chandra Nandy (communications and public works), Prasanna Deb Raikut (forest and excise), Mukunda Behari Mallick (cooperative credit and rural indebtedness), Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin (home), Nawab Khwaja Habibullah (agriculture and industry), Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (commerce and labour), Nawab Musharraf Hussain (judicial and legislative affairs), and Syed Nausher Ali (public health and local self-government). Huq promoted financial and land reforms with the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938), The Money Lenders' Act (1938), and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938). He introduced the Primary Education Bill to make primary education free and compulsory. He established schools such as the Lady Brabourne College. In 1941, Prime Minister Huq joined the Viceroy's Defence Council in support of Allied war efforts. In a letter to Governor John Herbert, Huq called for the resurrection of a Bengal Army. He wrote \"I want you to consent to the formation of a Bengali Army of a hundred thousand young Bengalis consisting of Hindu and Muslim youths on a fifty-fifty basis. There is an insistent demand for such a step being taken at once, and the people of Bengal will not be satisfied with any excuses. It is a national demand which must be immediately conceded\". Huq supported the adoption of the Lahore Resolution in 1940. He envisaged Bengal as one of the \"independent states\" outlined by the resolution."]}, {"page": "Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|John Herbert"]}, {"page": "A. K. Fazlul Huq", "response": ["Despite Huq enjoying the confidence of most of the assembly, he had tense relations with the Governor of Bengal, John Herbert. The governor favoured the provincial Muslim League leaders and patrons, including Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin, the Leader of the Opposition; and the \"Calcutta Trio\" in the assembly (Mirza Ahmad Ispahani, Khwaja Nooruddin and A. R. Siddiqui). The focal point of the League's campaign against Huq was that he was growing closer to Syama Prasad Mukherjee of the Hindu Mahasabha, who was alleged to be working against the political and religious interests of the Muslims. The League appealed to the governor to dismiss the Huq ministry.", "On 15 March 1943, the Prime Minister disclosed on the floor of the Assembly that on several occasions, under the guise of discretionary authority, the governor disregarded the advice tendered by the ministry and listed those occasions. The governor did not take those allegations kindly, and, largely due to his initiative, no-confidence motions were voted in the assembly on 24 March and 27 March. On both occasions the motions were defeated, although by narrow margins. To enforce his writ, the governor asked Huq to sign a prepared letter of resignation on 28 March 1943 and assigned himself the responsibility of administering the province under the provision of Section 92 of the constitution. A month later a League dominated ministry was commissioned with Nazimuddin as the Prime Minister. Huq bitterly criticized John Herbert for forcing his resignation and imposing Governor's rule, calling it \"an outrage on the Constitution\". Huq also criticized the colonial bureaucracy's role against his government, stating that \"the steel frame of the Imperial Service\" made a mockery of the authority of the elected government of Bengal. Huq accused John Herbert of being an ignorant administrator, stating \"After all, even busy Governors absent themselves from town on private business\". Huq paraphrased the ancient Greek philosopher Plutarch, stating \"The mills of God grind slowly but they grind exceeding small; and sooner perhaps than Sir John Herbert or the supporters of the Ministers may think, Nemesis will overtake those who [Nazimuddin] had rushed to office not to serve the people but to enjoy the sweets of power emoluments\"."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Herbert"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|John Herbert"]}, {"page": "John Herbert", "response": ["John Herbert may refer to:", "*John Herbert (c.1515-83 or later), MP for Much Wenlock 1553 and New Romney 1555", "*John Herbert (Secretary of State) (1550\u20131617), English Secretary of State and MP for Grampound 1586, Gatton 1589, Christchurch 1593, Bodmin 1597, Glamorgan 1601, Monmouthshire 1604", "*John Herbert (died 1659) (1625\u20131659), English politician", "*John Herbert (Conservative politician) (1895\u20131943), British Conservative Member of Parliament and Governor of Bengal", "*John Herbert, 8th Earl of Powis (born 1952), British peer", "*John Herbert (Queensland politician) (1925\u20131978), Australian Liberal politician", "*John Herbert (athlete) (born 1962), British athlete and bobsledder", "*John Herbert (actor) (1929\u20132011), Brazilian actor and film producer", "*John Herbert (playwright) (1926\u20132001), author of Fortune and Men's Eyes", "*John Herbert, Family Guy character who is the town's notorious pervert"]}, {"page": "1939 Monmouth by-election", "response": ["The Conservative MP John Herbert had resigned his seat on 1 July 1939, having been appointed as Governor of Bengal."]}, {"page": "J A Herbert", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Herbert (Conservative politician)"]}, {"page": "J.
