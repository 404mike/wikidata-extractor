Clochemerle is a stark contrast to the usual kind of bleak and somewhat fatalistic Galton & Simpson comedies. The tone is a gentle departure from  the doom and gloom  and dark comedy of their Steptoe and Son and Hancock's Half Hour. Filmed on location in the charming village of Colombier-le-Vieux, in the department of Ard\u00e8che, south of Lyon, France, it starred Roy Dotrice, Wendy Hiller, Cyril Cusack, Kenneth Griffith, Cyd Hayman, Bernard Bresslaw, Hugh Griffith, Micheline Presle, Madeline Smith, Christian Roberts, Nigel Green, Wolfe Morris and Gordon Rollings, with narration by Peter Ustinov. The show produced by Michael Mills was made as a co-production between Britain's BBC and West Germany's Bavaria Film. Incidental music was arranged by Alan Roper and played by L'Harmonie Du Rhone Orchestra, Lyon, under the musical direction of Raymond Jarniat."]}, {"page": "Tipton", "response": ["*Alan Roper (born 1939), footballer, born in Tipton and played as a defender for Walsall FC from 1962\u201365, following which he ran the Union Pub in Tipton"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "response": ["Following their success on the 1963 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa, team managers Bill McLaughlin and Alan Roper, together with captain John Thornett and vice-captain Ken Catchpole again led the Wallaby tour squad.Sometimes the Best Ever: The Story of the 1966/7 Wallabies; documentary by Theo Clark Media, 2017 Manager Bill McLaughlin was a 1936 two Test cap Wallaby, who would later serve a term a President of the Australian Rugby Union.
