His father, Alderman Simon Mahon (1886\u20131961), was a mayor of Bootle who ran for Liverpool Exchange MP in 1935. His brother, Peter, was elected MP for Preston South in 1964. His great-nephew, Peter Dowd, has been the Labour MP for the Bootle constituency since 2015, and served in the Shadow Cabinet under Jeremy Corbyn until 2020.Mahon was educated at St Joseph's Irish Christian Brothers school and at St James' School, Bootle. He became a general contractor. Mahon was a councillor and later an alderman of Bootle Borough Council and was chairman of the housing committee and Mayor of Bootle from 1962-63. He was chairman of Bootle Trades Council and Labour Party. Mahon was Member of Parliament for Bootle from 1955-79. He served as an opposition whip from 1959-61.In 1968, Mahon and his brother, Peter, together with another Catholic Labour MP, Walter Alldritt, threatened to resign the Whip. They had taken exception to remarks made by Douglas Houghton, Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, that large families were a form of \"social irresponsibility\". Only a midnight meeting with Prime Minister Harold Wilson and a written statement that Houghton's views were not party policy dissuaded the MPs from carrying out their threat.In 1969, Mahon was created a Papal Knight. Upon returning from his investiture Mass to the House of Commons, he was prevented from entering the Chamber by the Sergeant at Arms until he divested himself of his ceremonial sword. In 1978, Mahon wrote a letter of protest to Ladbrokes, complaining of their \"appalling taste\" in opening a book on the successor to Pope Paul VI.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bootle", "response": ["Originally a Conservative seat, Bootle elected early MPs such as Bonar Law, a future Tory Prime Minister. The seat was briefly Liberal in the early 1920s. Labour first captured the seat in 1929, in the personage of local hairdresser John Kinley, but lost it in 1931. Although Kinley recaptured it in 1945 it did not become safely Labour until the long tenure of Simon Mahon. It is now impregnable, politically, and since 1997 the Bootle constituency has been one of the safest Labour Party seats in the whole of the United Kingdom.

He joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and in 1910 was elected to Bootle Council in the Orrell ward as a Labour councillor, transferring to Knowsley ward in 1918. He became locally known as a popular speaker.  He stood for Bootle at the 1923 United Kingdom general election, sponsored by the ILP, as a last-minute replacement for Simon Mahon. He only won 13.8% of the vote, but when another election was held the following year, he had the advantage of a longer campaigning period, and was able to take second place, with 34.7% of the votes cast.Keith Gildart, \"Kinley, John (\"Jack\")\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XIII, pp.206\u2013217", "Kinley was made an alderman in Bootle in 1936, remaining on the council until 1949. He regained Bootle at the 1945 United Kingdom general election, and although he was less active in this term; he was consistent in supporting socialism and the unemployed. Kinley retained his seat at both the 1950 and 1951 general elections, and hoped to stand again in 1955, but was deselected by his Constituency Labour Party on the grounds of his age.
