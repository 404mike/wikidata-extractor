They had a goal disallowed after scoring directly from a corner kick, before taking the lead after 40 minutes through John Ferguson. In the early stages of the second half, Wales attempted to play more openly to find a goal, but the Scottish side took advantage of their opponent's inexperience and scored two further goals. The first was a rebound off the goalpost which was converted by Billy MacKinnon; the second was headed in by debutant James Lang. Scotland added a fourth through Henry McNeil and claimed a victory in front of a crowd of around 17,000 people, a record for an international fixture at the time. ", "Like the Welsh, the Scots fielded six players from one club (Queens Park) and three of their players were making their international debut: James Lang, Robert W. Neill and Moses McNeil. The latter was the brother of three-time capped Henry McNeil, who was also named in the team. Lang had lost the sight in one eye while working at a shipyard. The majority of the squad from their 3\u20130 victory over England three weeks earlier was retained. Both teams played a 2\u20132\u20136 formation; i.e. two full-backs, two half-backs and six forwards.", "The Scots were eager to take advantage of their early pressure but frequently allowed the ball to go out of play in their haste. They had a goal disallowed after Joseph Taylor scored directly from a corner without another player gaining a touch, while Evans again denied a goalscoring opportunity by blocking a goal-bound shot before David Thomson gathered the Scots' second attempt. On the 40th minute, Lang's cross was caught by David Thomson in the Welsh goal, but Ferguson \"seeing an advantage, jumped forward with remarkable suddenness\" according to newspaper reports, thus forcing Thomson to drop the ball which was subsequently kicked into the goal to the delight of the home crowd. Henry McNeil nearly added a second goal on the stroke of half-time after making a run at the Welsh goal before shooting over the crossbar just as the half was brought to a close.", "After the half-time interval, the Welsh team looked to utilise the \"downhill\" advantage and mounted early forays into the Scottish half of the pitch. The well-practised Scots took advantage of the openness of the Welsh side and around eight minutes into the second half, the Scots added a second goal as Campbell played a pass to Henry McNeil who promptly shot against the post. The Welsh goalkeeper David Thomson, believing the ball had gone out of play, stopped defending the goal as the ball rebounded out to Billy MacKinnon, who was able to turn the ball into the unguarded net. Within five minutes, Scotland extended their lead further as Wales were forced to push forward in an attempt to get back into the game. Scotland regained possession and, after playing several passes around the encamped Welsh defence, the ball was crossed towards Lang who headed in a goal on his debut. Suffering a three-goal deficit, Wales were unable to threaten any answer in return, while Campbell forced a save when he advanced on the Welsh goal almost immediately after the kick-off. The Welsh goal survived further scares until Henry McNeil completed the scoring after a combined move upfield by Ferguson and Kennedy won a corner kick. A goalmouth scramble ensued from the resulting cross before Henry McNeil was able to convert. MacKinnon made a final attempt on goal near the end of the game, going on a mazy individual dribble through the Welsh defence before being stopped by Kenrick. The match ended in a 4\u20130 win for Scotland.", "|FW ||  ||Henry McNeil "]}, {"page": "Henry Wace (footballer)", "response": ["Three weeks prior to the 1878 FA Cup Final, Wace was one of seven d\u00e9butantes selected for the friendly international against Scotland.

In the aftermath of this \"humiliating\" defeat, it became clear that England would have to change their style of play if they were to compete with the Scottish passing game which was far more productive than the English style which relied on dribbling."]}, {"page": "1874 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FW || Henry McNeil"]}, {"page": "1875 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||  Henry McNeil"]}, {"page": "1876 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||  Henry McNeil", "|FW ||  Henry McNeil"]}, {"page": "Harry McNeil", "response": ["#redirect Henry McNeil"]}, {"page": "1881 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FW || || Henry McNeil (c)"]}, {"page": "1880 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||  Henry McNeil (c)"]}, {"page": "1877\u201378 in Scottish football", "response": ["|John McDougall (3), John McGregor, Henry McNeil (2), Billy MacKinnon"]}, {"page": "1880\u201381 in Scottish football", "response": ["|George Ker (2), Henry McNeil, two own goals"]}, {"page": "1873\u201374 Queen's Park F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Henry McNeil"]}, {"page": "1874\u201375 Queen's Park F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Henry McNeil"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["* Henry McNeil, Peter McNeil (brother), Moses McNeil (brother)"]}, {"page": "Progression of association football goalscoring record", "response": ["| Henry McNeil ||  || 2 || 1876-03-04 || Hamilton Crescent ||  || 3\u20130 || ", "| Henry McNeil ||  || 3 || 1876-03-25 || Hamilton Crescent ||  || 4\u20130 || ", "| Henry McNeil ||  || 5 || 1878-03-02 || Hampden Park ||  || 7\u20132 || "]}, {"page": "Progression of association football goalscoring European record", "response": ["| Henry McNeil ||  || 2 || 1876-03-04 || Hamilton Crescent ||  || 3\u20130 || ", "| Henry McNeil ||  || 3 || 1876-03-25 || Hamilton Crescent ||  || 4\u20130 || ", "| Henry McNeil ||  || 5 || 1878-03-02 || Hampden Park ||  || 7\u20132 || "]}]}}
