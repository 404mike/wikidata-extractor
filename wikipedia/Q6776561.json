Hartlepool had been leading 2\u20131 with eight minutes of regular time to go, but a controversial penalty decision in the 82nd minute, which also saw Chris Westwood sent off, allowed Sheffield Wednesday to level the scores making it 2\u20132 at the end of 90 minutes. Hartlepool missing a key defender, struggled in extra time and conceded two goals. Following this achievement Cooper's assistant Martin Scott was appointed as manager.", "The 2005\u201306 season saw the side slip down the division to the relegation places helped in part by poor management, an indecisive board room and key player injuries. Manager Martin Scott was suspended after an alleged fight with a player in the changing rooms, which resulted in his dismissal. Youth team coach Paul Stephenson was put in charge until the end of the season, aided by former manager Chris Turner who returned to the club as Director of Sport, and despite remaining undefeated in his first five games in charge, he could not prevent the club being relegated into the fourth tier in May 2006. Some felt that Hartlepool's relegation was unfair given that Rotherham United had escaped administration, and therefore a 10-point deduction and relegation, by delaying a CVA meeting until after the season had ended."]}, {"page": "Martin Scott", "response": ["Martin Scott may refer to:", "* Martin Scott (politician), representative of District 2 to the Georgia House of Representatives", "* Martin Scott (cricketer) (born 1943), cricketer", "* Martin Scott (English footballer) (born 1968), played for Rotherham United, Bristol City and Sunderland, former manager of Hartlepool United F.C.", "* Martin Scott (Scottish footballer) (born 1986), played for Hibernian, Ross County and Livingston", "* Martin Scott (military officer), signatory of the Treaty of St. Peters", "* Martin Scott (writer), pseudonym of Martin Millar, author of the Thraxas fantasy series", "* Martin Scott (FDNY Commissioner) (1898\u20131979), Fire Commissioner of the City of New York"]}, {"page": "Neill Collins", "response": ["He never appeared in the top-flight for the Black Cats after Alan Stubbs was signed, and was instead loaned out to League One side Hartlepool United in August 2005.

His knee injury caused him to miss the second half of the campaign. In September 2005 Clarke was loaned to Port Vale, but played just two minutes after being utilised as a late substitute by manager Martin Foyle. Despite his return to full fitness being described by manager Martin Scott as a 'massive boost', his appearances were again limited once he returned to Victoria Park.

Following Martin Scott's promotion to the assistant manager's position, Stephenson was made the main youth team coach. Stephenson guided the youth team to victory in the Under 19s section of the Dallas Cup. Towards the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Stephenson was appointed as Hartlepool's caretaker manager after the dismissal of Scott. His first game in charge was a goalless draw against Rotherham. In his second game he managed to guide the team to a single-goal victory over Chesterfield. He was undefeated in his first five games in charge. However, Hartlepool slipped back into the relegation zone and were eventually relegated on the last day of the season. Stephenson stated that he did not want to take over as manager and wanted to remain a coach, and he returned to his job as youth team coach. Upon the arrival of new manager Glenn Roeder at Norwich, and his decision to build his own backroom staff, Stephenson was offered the job of first-team coach in early November 2007. Despite some trouble with the Hartlepool chairman regarding compensation, Roeder was ultimately successful with the appointment, and Stephenson commenced work with the Canaries two months later."]}]}}
