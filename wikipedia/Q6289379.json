Following that appearance, he fell behind new loan signings Jake Livermore and Josh Simpson in the pecking order and found himself relegated to the bench, which led to his departure on loan for the rest of the season in January 2010.

The effect was to allow Simpson and two other players (Josh Simpson and Michael Gash) a free transfer at the end of the season, instead of the usual position where City would have been entitled to a fee under the Bosman ruling requirements for players under the age of 24. The contract amendments were discovered by new Directors (from the Cambridge City Supporters Trust) who had taken over after George and other Directors resigned amidst wider accusations of financial impropriety, which were later to lead to a High Court case. George subsequently moved to Cambridge United and City received no compensation for the three players."]}, {"page": "Simpson (name)", "response": ["* Josh Simpson (disambiguation), several people", "** Josh Simpson (glass artist) (born 1949), American glass artist", "** Josh Simpson (Canadian soccer) (born 1983), Canadian soccer player", "** Josh Simpson (English footballer) (born 1987), English footballer", "** Josh Simpson (Australian footballer) (born 1994), Australian rules footballer"]}, {"page": "Josh Simpson", "response": ["Josh Simpson may refer to:", "* Josh Simpson (Australian footballer) (born 1994), Australian footballer for the Fremantle Football Club", "* Josh Simpson (Canadian soccer) (born 1983), Canadian soccer player", "* Josh Simpson (English footballer) (born 1987), English footballer", "* Josh Simpson (glass artist) (born 1949), American glass artist"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|10||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"|Josh Simpson", "| 31 December 2010|| Josh Simpson|| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Peterborough United || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Undisclosed||"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|12 ||MF || ||11 ||Josh Simpson || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Football League One", "response": ["| Josh Simpson"]}, {"page": "2009\u20132011 International Challenge Trophy", "response": [" England C: Preston Edwards; Lee Vaughan, Connor Franklin (Matty Blair 65), Rob Atkinson, Max Porter, Michael Wilde (Josh Coulson 73), Andy Mangan, Danny Rose (Jack Byrne 81), George Donnelly, Josh Simpson (Reece Styche 71), Sean Clancy"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Josh Simpson"]}, {"page": "2013 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["Swansea's third round opponents were Crawley Town.
