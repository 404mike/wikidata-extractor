In comparison, from a sample of 5 Panzer IVs, 4 tanks burned (80 percent) and 1 tank remained unburned, following an average of 1.5 penetrations. The Panther tank burned 14 times (63 percent) from a sample of 22 tanks and following 3.24 penetrations, while the Tiger burned 4 times (80 percent) out of a sample of 5 tanks following 3.25 penetrations.Copp, pp. 399\u2013406 John Buckley, using a case study of the British 8th and 29th Armoured Brigades, found that of their 166 Shermans knocked out in combat during the Normandy campaign, 94 (56.6 percent) burned out. Buckley also notes that an American survey carried out concluded that 65% of tanks burned out after being penetrated.Buckley, p. 127 United States Army research proved that the major reason for this was the stowage of main gun ammunition in the vulnerable sponsons above the tracks. A U.S. Army study in 1945 concluded that only 10\u201315 percent of wet stowage Shermans burned when penetrated, compared to 60\u201380 percent of the older dry-stowage Shermans.Zaloga (2008), pp. 116\u201318 As a burned tank was unrecoverable, it was prudent in combat to continue to fire at a tank until it burned."]}, {"page": "Operation Goodwood", "response": ["Simon Trew wrote that \"the first estimates of Allied losses for Operation Goodwood appeared horrific, that Second Army had lost  G.

Tamelander and Niklas Zetterling wrote that during Goodwood 469\u00a0tanks were lost by the armoured divisions (including 131\u00a0tanks on the 19 July and 68 on the 20 July) but that the majority could be repaired. Trew rejected those figures and wrote that after much investigation, VIII Corps losses amounted to 197 tanks on 18 July, 99\u00a0tanks on 19 July and  on 20 July, \"for a total of  which  completely destroyed\". Trew wrote that \"the tank strength returns for VIII Corps  show a loss of 218 tanks (that could not be repaired or immediately replaced), including 145 tanks from 11th Armoured Division\".

In 2012, Ken Ford wrote that the inquiry was, perforce, a whitewash, blaming instrument failures rather than incompetence but the report was still kept secret until 1946. In 1991, John Buckley wrote that the ASV Hudsons had been forbidden to use flares off Brest, because of the presence of Sealion and that one of the technical faults to an ASV could have been repaired, had the operator carried out a fuze check properly. Joubert was criticised for complacency, in not sending replacement sorties, despite his earlier warning that the Brest Group was about to sail, because of the assumption in Operation Fuller since 6 April 1941, that a day sailing was certain,"]}, {"page": "Strategic bombing during World War II", "response": ["The impact of bombing on German morale was significant according to Professor John Buckley. Around a third of the urban population under threat of bombing had no protection at all. Some of the major cities saw 55\u201360 percent of dwellings destroyed. Mass evacuations were a partial answer for six million civilians, but this had a severe effect on morale as German families were split up to live in difficult conditions. By 1944, absenteeism rates of 20\u201325 percent were not unusual and in post-war analysis 91 percent of civilians stated bombing was the most difficult hardship to endure and was the key factor in the collapse of their own morale.Buckley 1998, p. 166. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that the bombing was not stiffening morale but seriously depressing it; fatalism, apathy, defeatism were apparent in bombed areas. The Luftwaffe was blamed for not warding off the attacks and confidence in the Nazi regime fell by 14 percent. By the spring of 1944, some 75 percent of Germans believed the war was lost, owing to the intensity of the bombing.Kershaw 1987, pp. 206\u2013207."]}, {"page": "Battle for Caen", "response": ["====John Buckley, 2014====", "The British had to defeat the Germans with the minimum of casualties to create the circumstances necessary for a lasting peace and since the 1990s the methods used by Montgomery had been re-evaluated, with his \"disagreeable....peculiar and difficult personality\" being given less prominence. Monographs on parts of the army have shown that they performed well and the Canadians have been rescued from historical oblivion, through the use of \"contemporary documents, reports and operational analyses\", rather than journalistic writing, apologetics and testimony. In a publication of 2000, David French showed that the British Army had overcome its early defeats and had become an effective fighting force in the second half of the war. In Normandy the army knew what it could do and how to defeat German forces which had more experience. In the same year, Stephen Hart published Montgomery and Colossal Cracks: 21st Army Group in Northwest Europe 1944\u20135 and judged Montgomery's methods to have been right for the circumstances, that they were highly effective and that despite inadequacies, there were no better alternatives. In 2004, John Buckley argued that British tank forces had performed well in Normandy, by adapting better than German armoured units."]}, {"page": "59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division", "response": ["On 9 July, the 59th Division was ordered to consolidate the area it had captured and search for German holdouts, before advancing to capture the next line of German positions in the villages and farms of Bitot, Couvrechef, and La Folie. At midday, the 33rd Armoured Brigade, attached to the 3rd Infantry Division, moved across the division's line of advance and captured Couvrechef. The 3rd Infantry's advance threatened to cut off the Germans still resisting the 59th's push south. The delay in capturing Bitot also impacted moves by the Canadians, who came under fire from the German positions there. The 3rd British and 3rd Canadian Divisions entered Caen during the day. The following morning, the 59th Division moved through the villages north of the city, mopping up remaining German units, before entering the city. During the operation, the division suffered 1,200 casualties including 239 men killed. The historian John Buckley wrote \"for the inexperienced troops of 59th Division for whom Charnwood was their baptism of fire, the grim and appalling realities of combat were a chastening experience.\""]}, {"page": "John Buckley", "response": ["John Buckley may refer to:", "* John Buckley (Canadian politician) (1863\u20131942), member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, 1921\u20131935", "* John Buckley (attorney) (1885\u20131959), Connecticut politician", "* John Buckley (Virginia politician) (born 1953), Virginia politician", "* John Buckley (baseball) (1869\u20131942), American baseball pitcher", "* John Buckley (cricketer) (born 1956), South African cricketer", "* John Buckley (footballer, born 1962), Scottish football manager and former professional footballer ", "* John Buckley (footballer, born 1999), English footballer", "* John Buckley (Aghabullogue hurler) (1863\u20131935), Irish hurler for Cork and Aghabullogue", "* John Buckley (Glen Rovers hurler) (born 1958), Irish hurler for Cork and Glen Rovers", "* John Buckley (martyr) (died 1598), English religious leader and martyr", "* John Buckley (bishop) (born 1939), Irish Catholic religious leader", "* John Buckley (composer) (born 1951), Irish composer", "* John Buckley (historian) (born 1967), professor of military history at the University of Wolverhampton", "* John Buckley (sculptor) (born 1945), English sculptor ", "* John Buckley (VC) (1813\u20131876), British Victoria Cross recipient"]}, {"page": "Kirkham Grammar School", "response": ["* John Buckley (born 1967), Professor of Military History"]}, {"page": "Operation Perch", "response": ["The failure of the operation led Dempsey to write that there was \"no chance now of a snap operation with airborne troops either to seize Caen or to deepen the bridgehead on XXX Corps front. It is clear now that Caen can be taken only by set-piece assault and we do not have the men or ammunition for that at this time\". After the war he wrote that the attack by the 7th Armoured Division should have succeeded and that his doubts about the suitability of Bucknall and Erskine increased. Dempsey called the handling of the battle a disgrace and said that the decision to withdraw from Villers-Bocage was made by the corps commander and Erskine. Carlo D'Este called Dempsey's comments \"excessively harsh\" but historians generally support them, suggesting that a great opportunity swiftly to capture Caen had been squandered by Bucknall. John Buckley wrote that Bucknall was not ready to support the attack once problems developed and that Erskine was not capable of mastering the situation. The British official historian, Lionel Ellis, wrote that the result was \"disappointing\" but that the fighting power of the Panzer-Lehr Division and with the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division \"could hardly have achieved full success\". In 2001, Michael Reynolds wrote that the 2nd Panzer Division tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage.
