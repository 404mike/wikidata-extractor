The 13th century ecclesiastical buildings were largely ruined during the dissolution of the monasteries. It then passed to John Byron, an MP and Royalist commander, who was created a baron in 1643. He died childless in France and ownership transferred to his brother Richard Byron. Richard's son William was a minor poet and was succeeded in 1695 by his son William Byron, 4th Baron Byron. Early in the 18th century, the 4th Lord Byron landscaped the gardens extensively, and amassed a hugely admired collection of artistic masterpieces.", "During the ownership of William, 5th Baron Byron, the Abbey suffered a downturn in fortunes. As a young man, William lavished money on the estate, building picturesque Gothic follies and staging glamorous mock navy battles on the lake. Continuing to take out loans and pursue his pleasures of horse-racing, gambling, and going to the theatre, he found himself financially reliant on a scheme of marrying off his only surviving son and heir to a wealthy heiress. The plan fell apart when his heir eloped with his cousin Juliana Byron, daughter of William's brother John Byron."]}, {"page": "Custos Rotulorum of Nottinghamshire", "response": ["* Sir John Byron, Sr. by 1562\u20131567.

The most senior, William Cavendish, was now allowing his government responsibilities to slip into chaos as he settled on his Derbyshire estates with Bess of Hardwick. Sir John Byron was a heavy investor in Nottinghamshire monastic properties. Sir John Porte had bought most of the Dale Abbey estates in 1543 and made himself perhaps the greatest landowner in Derbyshire; Thomas Powtrell had bought Stanley Grange and other Dale properties in 1544.
