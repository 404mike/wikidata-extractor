Chaplin was the elder half-brother of actor and director Charlie Chaplin and served as his business manager in later life.\nThrough their mother Hannah, they were older half-brothers to the younger Wheeler Dryden, who grew up separately with his father in England and was not told about his brothers until 1915. Dryden later immigrated to the United States, joining the Chaplins in Hollywood. Sydney Chaplin was also a half-uncle of actor Sydney Chaplin (1926\u20132009), who was named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 16", "response": ["*1965 \u2013 Sydney Chaplin, English actor, comedian, brother of Charlie Chaplin (b. 1885)"]}, {"page": "Charlie Chaplin", "response": ["Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers. In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a \"pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster\" who \"looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre\". However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract. Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.", "Mutual was patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, \"Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants... It is quality, not quantity, we are after.\" In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1million. He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order. It was completed in January 1918, and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.", "Chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures, to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast, expecting them to imitate him exactly. He personally edited all of his films, trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted. As a result of his complete independence, he was identified by the film historian Andrew Sarris as one of the first auteur filmmakers. Chaplin did receive help, notably from his long-time cinematographer Roland Totheroh, brother Sydney Chaplin, and various assistant directors such as Harry Crocker and Charles Reisner."]}, {"page": "March 16", "response": ["*  1885   \u2013 Sydney Chaplin, English actor (d. 1965)"]}, {"page": "1965", "response": ["* April 16 \u2013 Sydney Chaplin, English actor (b. 1885)"]}, {"page": "The Great Dictator", "response": ["A digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection in May 2011.

The elder Clampett was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland in 1882, and he immigrated to the United States with his parents at age two in 1884. Clampett was displaying extraordinary art skills by the age of five. From the beginning, Clampett was intrigued with and influenced by Douglas Fairbanks, Lon Chaney, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, and he began making film short-subjects in his garage beginning when he was twelve. While living in Hollywood as a young boy, Clampett and his mother Joan lived next door to Charlie Chaplin and his brother Sydney Chaplin. Clampett also recalled watching his father play handball at the Los Angeles Athletic Club with another of the great silent comedians, Harold Lloyd. From his early teens Clampett showed an interest in animation and puppetry. Clampett made hand puppets as a child and, before adolescence, had completed what animation historian Milt Gray describes as \"a sort of prototype, a kind of nondescript dinosaur sock puppet that later evolved into Cecil.\" In high school, Clampett drew a full-page comic about the nocturnal adventures of a pussycat, later published in color in a Sunday edition of the Los Angeles Times. King Features took note and offered Clampett a \"cartoonist's contract\" to begin a seventy-five dollars a week after high school. King Features allowed Clampett to work in their Los Angeles art department on Saturdays and vacations during high school. On occasion, King Features would print one of Clampett's cartoons for encouragement. In addition, they paid his way through Otis Art Institute, where Clampett learned to paint with oils and to sculpt."]}, {"page": "List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients (A\u2013D)", "response": ["| Original Broadway cast (Judy Holliday, Sydney Chaplin)"]}, {"page": "Music hall", "response": ["* Sydney Chaplin (1885\u20131965)"]}, {"page": "7th Annual Grammy Awards", "response": ["**Jule Styne & Robert Merrill (composers) & the original cast (Barbra Streisand, Sydney Chaplin, Danny Meehan, Kay Medford, Jean Stapleton & John Lankston) for Funny Girl"]}, {"page": "The Tramp", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" align=\"left\" |  || align=\"left\" |  || align=\"left\" |  The Tramp || align=\"left\" | Half-reel.

Perhaps the best known film version was released in 1941, directed by Archie Mayo and starring Jack Benny in the title role. This version slightly alters the plotline from the original version (for instance, Babbs is framed for accidentally setting off a fire alarm at Oxford University and faces expulsion). The play's story was popular in Germany and Austria, with at least four different film versions being released: in 1934; 1956 (starring Heinz R\u00fchmann); 1963 (starring Peter Alexander), and a television version in 1976.
