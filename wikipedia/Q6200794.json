McKinnell was one of three players from the Dumfries club, alongside Willie McCall and Tom Wylie to move to the English Football League around that time. These three transfers combined with Ian Dickson's move to Aston Villa helped fund the Doonhamers purchase of Palmerston Park.McKinnell played in 111 league matches and 13 FA Cup games in six seasons for the Ewood Park club. McKinnell then signed for Darlington, where he played in 101 league matches and scored one goal in three seasons.
