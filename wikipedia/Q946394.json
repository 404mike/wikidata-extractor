Naysmith made his professional debut, aged only 17, several months later in a League Cup tie with Celtic. His opportunity arose from a suspension crisis, the Maroons having no fewer than four defenders (Bruno, Weir, Ritchie and Pointon) sent off in their previous match at Rangers. Despite the patchwork nature of their defence, Hearts defeated Celtic 1\u20130, with Naysmith earning plaudits for his mature display. Within a year he had established himself as the side's first-choice left back, displacing Neil Pointon, and in 1998 helped the Tynecastle club end their 36-year trophy drought by lifting the Scottish Cup. That season he was also named Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year."]}, {"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Neil Pointon||||FB||1985\u20131989||138||5"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 in English football", "response": ["10 July 1992 \u2013 Oldham Athletic pay a club record \u00a3600,000 for Manchester City defender Neil Pointon."]}, {"page": "Ray Graydon", "response": ["Replacing Jan S\u00f8rensen as Walsall manager in May 1998, Graydon led Walsall to promotion out of the Second Division as runners-up behind Fulham in 1998\u201399.

Manchester City and Reading had also spent millions, yet finished behind the \"Saddlers\".

He stuck to a rigid 4\u20134\u20132 system, and picked up 12 away wins operating a counter-attacking system. His best signing proved to be midfielder Darren Wrack, who came on a free transfer from Grimsby Town and went on to be voted onto the PFA Team of the Year.

He played 239 times for Oldham between 1992 and 1998, and scored four goals. In summer 1998 he joined former Oldham manager Neil Warnock at Bury, on a Bosman transfer. When Warnock left the club in December 1999, Redmond and Andy Preece became joint caretaker-managers. Preece was appointed manager on a permanent basis at the end of the season, and Redmond became player-assistant manager. After five years at Bury, Redmond ended his career with a spell in non-league football.

He was soon a regular player in the Boundary Park midfield, helping them achieve survival in the First Division in 1991\u201392 and the new FA Premier League in 1992\u201393. He helped them reach the FA Cup semi-finals in the 1993\u201394 campaign, and when the Latics took the lead over Manchester United with an extra time goal by Neil Pointon, it looked as though Bernard and his teammates were on their way to the club's first ever FA Cup final. However, a late equaliser by United's Mark Hughes forced a replay, which the Latics lost 4\u20131 at Maine Road.

Everton had more of the possession in the latter part of the first half, but both sides continued to attack. Sharp made a run down the right wing, with Coventry's defence stretched, but Phillips stopped the attack with a well-timed tackle.

Paul Power ran down the right, crossing the ball into the penalty area over Ogrizovic's head, but Pickering cleared the ball over the crossbar.

Just before half-time, Heath back-heeled the ball to Steven who sprinted down the pitch and delivered a pass into the centre.
