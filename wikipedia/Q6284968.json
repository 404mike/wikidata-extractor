Both teams would advance to the second round after they drew their replay on 27 September and the Scottish Football Association decided to allow them both into the draw.

It would be the first time the defending champions failed to make it past the first hurdle as a brace from Joseph Lindsay helped Dumbarton to a 4\u20133 win in their first competitive match at Boghead Park.
