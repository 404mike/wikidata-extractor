Deane is reputed to have prepared 10 schemes for the royal commission. Although the St James location was preferred, a scheme that did not involve the disturbance of or use of land in Hyde Park was sought. The extension of Belmore Park was initially proposed in the 1897 scheme as compensation for the use of the northwestern corner of Hyde Park as a railway station. Following a change of government the St James scheme was abandoned and Deane prepared, , a further two schemes, one of which was for the Old Burial Ground Site.thumb|left|Central station was built on land previously occupied by the Devonshire Street CemeteryThe royal commission in 1897 again considered the city railway extension because of dangerous congestion at Redfern and recommended using Hyde Park. Then, after an investigative trip overseas, Henry Deane prepared alternative proposals for a new railway terminal for the government in 1900. The second scheme proposal called for the resumption of the Devonshire Street cemeteries, but this was cheaper and less contentious than the acquisition of Hyde Park. It was the second scheme which was eventually adopted.", "Henry Deane, in a lecture given to the Sydney University Engineering Society in 1902, describes the layout of the Central Railway Station that was currently under construction: In his lecture, he also discusses many of the technical aspects of the design including luggage handling, the lifts, the water towers, the train shed roof, which was subsequently deleted as a cost-cutting measure, the platforms and signalling. A novel method of luggage handling was designed for Central to \"get rid of the objectionable luggage-trolley, which is always frightening nervous people\". A overhead luggage carrying system had been developed in England, however, in the case of Central station, \"the levels permit of its being carried on underground by means of subways and lifts at suitable points\". The mail was also to be transferred by subway.", "In 1902 the Railway and Tramway Construction Branch, headed by Henry Deane, reported that \"plans and detail drawings have been prepared in the office for the whole of the retaining wall and shops in Pitt-Street, both north and south of the new road in front of the Station, also for the Devonshire-Street subway and for the whole of the basement floors, including drainage, telephone tunnels, &c.\" At this stage, the estimated cost of the works was 561,600 pounds, however, it was \"probable that his estimate will be exceeded\"."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of New South Wales", "response": ["|1897 || Henry Deane || Engineering ||", "|1907 || Henry Deane || Engineering || Second term"]}, {"page": "Trans-Australian Railway", "response": ["Because of the inevitable problems of finding suitable water for steam locomotives in a desert, the original engineer, Henry Deane envisaged diesel locomotives for the line and made inquiries with potential manufacturers, although the technology was not well developed at the time.

This was repeated for each span but on the second span it was found that the optical readings did not match the water gauge. The cause was found to be a slow leak in a connecting pipe of the water gauge equipment. There was only one water gauge available and as the leak would become worse as the equipment was moved from span to span for each reading it was decided to abandon this method and rely wholly on the optical readings."]}, {"page": "Eucalyptus acaciiformis", "response": ["Eucalyptus acaciiformis was first formally described in 1899 by Henry Deane and Joseph Maiden who published the description in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales.
