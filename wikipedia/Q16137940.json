He played in the Football League for Aldershot, Portsmouth and Reading. Youlden spent the 1971 season on loan to the Dallas Tornado of the North American Soccer League. After his playing career was over he became a youth coach at Chelsea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robin Friday", "response": ["Despite his immediate impact on the pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots."]}, {"page": "1971 North American Soccer League season", "response": ["|Tommy Youlden, Dallas"]}, {"page": "Youlden", "response": ["* Tommy Youlden, (born 1949), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Youlden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Youlden"]}]}}
