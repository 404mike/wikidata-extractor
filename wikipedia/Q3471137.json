He also served a term as Chief Justice of Queensland and two terms as Premier of Queensland, and played a key role in the drafting of the Australian Constitution.\nGriffith was born in Wales, arriving in the Colony of Queensland at the age of eight. He attended the University of Sydney, and after further legal training was called to the bar in 1867. Griffith was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1872. He served as Attorney-General from 1874 to 1878, and subsequently became the leader of the parliament's liberal faction. Griffith's terms as premier ran from 1883 to 1888 and from 1890 to 1893. He led the Australian delegation to the 1887 Colonial Conference and took a keen interest in external affairs, giving financial and administrative support to the newly annexed Territory of Papua and establishing the Queensland Maritime Defence Force. Domestically, he had a reputation as a radical and was initially seen as an ally of the labour movement; this changed after his government's intervention in the 1891 shearers' strike.\nIn 1893, Griffith retired from politics to head the Supreme Court of Queensland. He was frequently asked to assist in drafting legislation, and the Queensland criminal code \u2013 the first in Australia \u2013 was mostly his creation. Griffith was an ardent federationist, and with Andrew Inglis Clark wrote the draft constitution that was presented to the 1891 constitutional convention. Many of his contributions were preserved in the final constitution enacted in 1900. Griffith was involved in the drafting of the federal Judiciary Act 1903, which established the High Court of Australia, and was subsequently nominated by Alfred Deakin to become the inaugural Chief Justice. He presided over a number of constitutional cases, though some of his interpretations were rejected by later courts. He was also called on to advise governors-general during political instability. Griffith University and the Canberra suburb of Griffith are named in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 9", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 Samuel Griffith, Welsh-Australian politician, 9th Premier of Queensland (b. 1845)"]}, {"page": "June 21", "response": ["*1845 \u2013 Samuel Griffith, Welsh-Australian politician, 9th Premier of Queensland (d. 1920)"]}, {"page": "Premier of Queensland", "response": ["| Sir Samuel Griffith, ", "| Sir Samuel Griffith,  ", "  from:1883  till:1888 color:LIB  $right text:\"1883-1888_Samuel Griffith\"", "  from:1890  till:1893 color:COM  $left text:\"(second time) Samuel Griffith_1890-1893\""]}, {"page": "1920", "response": ["* August 9 \u2013 Sir Samuel Griffith, Australian politician and judge (b. 1845)"]}, {"page": "Waltzing Matilda", "response": ["In Queensland in 1891 the Great Shearers' Strike brought the colony close to civil war and was broken only after the Premier of Queensland, Samuel Griffith, called in the military.

The Attorney-General of Tasmania Andrew Inglis Clark also contributed to the constitution's judicial clauses.

The original formulation of Griffith, Barton and Kingston provided only that the parliament could establish a court.", "After the draft had been approved by the electors of the colonies, it was taken to London in 1899 for the assent of the British Imperial Parliament. The issue of Privy Council appeals remained a sticking point however; with objections made by Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, the Chief Justice of South Australia, Sir Samuel Way, and Samuel Griffith, among others. In October 1899, Griffith made representations to Chamberlain soliciting suggestions from British ministers for alterations to the draft, and offered alterations of his own. Indeed, such was the effect of these and other representations that Chamberlain called for delegates from the colonies to come to London to assist with the approval process, with a view to their approving any alterations that the British government might see fit to make; delegates were sent, including Deakin, Barton and Charles Kingston, although they were under instructions that they would never agree to changes.", "Deakin's friend, painter Tom Roberts, who viewed the speech from the public gallery, declared it Deakin's \"magnum opus\".

After O'Connor's death in 1912, an amendment to the Judiciary Act 1903 expanded the bench to seven. For most of 1930, two seats were left vacant due to monetary constraints placed on the court by the Depression. The economic downturn had also led to a reduction in litigation and consequently less work for the court. After Isaacs retired in 1931, his seat was left empty, and in 1933 an amendment to the Judiciary Act officially reduced the number of seats to six. However, this led to some decisions being split three-all. With the appointment of William Webb in 1946, the number of seats returned to seven, and since then the court has had seven Justices.  there have been 55 Justices, thirteen of whom have been Chief Justice.", "13 politicians, serving or former, have been appointed to the High Court of Australia.

This was rejected by the British Colonial Secretary mostly because of fears that it would expose even more of its inhabitants to be forcibly taken to work and possibly die in Queensland. The large influx of New Guinea labourers also sparked concern from white supremacist anti-immigration groups, which led to the election in late 1883 of Samuel Griffith on an anti-Kanaka policy platform. Griffith quickly banned recruitment from the New Guinea islands and spearheaded a number of high-profile criminal cases against blackbirding crews operating in the area. The crew of Alfred Vittery were charged with the murder of South Sea Islanders, while Captain Joseph Davies of Stanley, Captain Millman of Jessie Kelly, Captain Loutit of Ethel as well as the owners of Forest King were all charged with kidnapping. All of these cases, despite strong evidence against them, resulted in acquittal. Charges of neglect resulting in death against plantation managers were also made. For example, Mr Melhuish of the Yeppoon Sugar Plantation was tried, but even though he was found responsible, the judge involved imposed only the minimum \u00a35 fine and wished it could be an even lesser amount. During a riot at the Mackay racetrack, several South Sea Islanders were beaten to death by mounted white men wielding stirrup irons. Only one man, George Goyner, was convicted and received a minor punishment of two months imprisonment."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1901\u20131910)", "response": ["*Sir Samuel Griffith (1845\u20131920)"]}, {"page": "Murray Gleeson", "response": ["Gleeson was born in Wingham, New South Wales, and studied law at the University of Sydney.

As required by the constitution, he retired from the court when he reached his 70th birthday.", "In May 1998, Gleeson was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, replacing Sir Gerard Brennan. He was the first Chief Justice of a state supreme court to be appointed Chief Justice of the High Court since Samuel Griffith, whose own state Chief Justiceship preceded the formation of the High Court. He is also the first Chief Justice not to have been made a knight (however, Australia had ceased the practice of awarding knighthoods some years previously). During his tenure as Chief Justice, Gleeson actively maintained the importance of judicial independence in the face of increasing executive government power and public anger with court decisions. He also spoke out against the use of torture, forced confessions and detention without trial."]}, {"page": "Liberalism in Australia", "response": ["Some of the earliest pioneers of the federation movement, men such as Alfred Deakin, came under the influence of David Syme of The Age. Other influencers  of federalism included Samuel Griffith who while initially was seen as a supporter of the labour movement became partisan against the Labour movement with his legal intervention in the 1891 Australian Shearers' strike. While all of these men were generally self-described \"liberals\" their understanding of liberalism differed substantially. At the time, Deakin was sometimes described as a \"radical\", and was disliked by both urban conservatives, and the squatting class of Australia. (However, Deakin was also consistently opposed to Labor, instrumental in the fusion of the centre-right parties, a strong supporter of the White Australia policy, and a prominent proponent of stronger trade and defence ties to the British Empire \u2013 a position that gained him admirers amongst tories in the UK. R. Norris, 1981, \"Deakin, Alfred (1856\u20131919)\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, (access: 30 August 2021).) The degree of progressive sentiments also varied from colony to colony: social liberals such as  David Syme were prominent in Victoria while others were prominent in South Australia, for instance. At any rate, Australia's parliamentary institutions, especially at a national level, were brand-new, so it was difficult for anyone to be labelled \"conservative\" in a traditional sense.  The two largest political parties, the Free Trade Party and the Protectionist Party, could both loosely be described as \"liberal\" in the terms of the time. They were moderates with a strong belief in parliamentary institutions, financially orthodox and attached to the British Empire, with a distaste for radicalism. The third major political force was the trade union movement represented by Australian Labor Party. The rise in popularity of the Labor party began to become the major pre-occupation of these two other parties.
