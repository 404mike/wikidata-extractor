While a Blackburn player, he was capped once for the England under-21 team and played on the winning side in the 2002 Football League Cup Final. Taylor moved to Birmingham City in 2004, where he spent six seasons, and played for Norwich City on loan. He was involved in an incident in 2008 in which Arsenal player Eduardo da Silva suffered a badly broken leg. Unable to force his way into Birmingham's first team after their return to the Premier League, he joined Watford in January 2010. Taylor quickly established himself in Watford's first team, starting every league game in the 2010\u201311 season, but injury disrupted his next season, and he joined Sheffield Wednesday in August 2012. He played infrequently for Wednesday, spent time on loan at Brentford, and was released at the end of the 2013\u201314 season, and subsequently retired.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 9", "response": ["*  1979   \u2013 Martin Taylor, English footballer"]}, {"page": "William Gallas", "response": ["Gallas attracted some criticism as a result of his actions in a 2\u20132 draw against Birmingham City on 23 February 2008, a game in which his teammate Eduardo had his leg broken following a challenge by Martin Taylor.

In a cruel twist of irony Eduardo's own leg was broken by a tackle by Birmingham City's Martin Taylor in 2008. In July 2008 he was reported that he was transferred to biggest Dinamo rival Hajduk Split on a free transfer, signing a four-year contract. After securing a first eleven spot in the 2008/2009 season, he was removed from the first team squad in late 2009 for refusing to sign a new contract with a wage cut. A new contract was signed 6 months later, and was set to feature in the first team again, but broke his right leg in training in July 2010, after featuring only in a single league match.

Derby County were in real trouble in the Premier League, occupying 20th position, with 19th-place Fulham well out of reach for the East Midlands club.

A Larsson goal looked like it had secured a valuable three points for the Blues before an 89th-minute Emanuel Villa goal secured a point for Derby. A trip to West Ham was next up for the Blues. Freddie Ljungberg scored in the opening encounters for the Hammers, but a penalty from new signing McFadden made sure that the Blues would at least leave with a point. The last game of the month was a home match between the Blues and Arsenal. A 28th-minute free kick from McFadden opened the scoring, before two Theo Walcott goals within five minutes looked to have given the points to Arsenal, before an injury time McFadden penalty stole a point for the Blues. The game became highly controversial as within minutes of the kick off, a badly timed challenge by centre-back Martin Taylor broke the leg of Arsenal striker Eduardo. No one could complain about the automatic red card that referee Mike Dean showed Taylor, but comments after the game by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger campaigned for a much longer ban than the traditional three-match ban. Although Wenger later retracted his comments, his idea gained support with Sepp Blatter in particular, who campaigned for Taylor to be punished with a season-long ban.
