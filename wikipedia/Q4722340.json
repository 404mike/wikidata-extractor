He was educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford before being awarded a Fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, where he gained his Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1855 and his Oxford Master of Arts (MA Oxon) in 1857. From 1857, he was a Curate at Kidderminster, then its Vicar, having been ordained priest in 1858 (and presumably deacon the previous year).\nAfter this, he held further incumbencies in Stepney, Islington, and Barking, before becoming Archdeacon of Essex in the Diocese of St Albans (1878\u20131882). From there he moved to become Archdeacon of Colchester in the same diocese, and at the same time the first Bishop of Colchester (a suffragan bishop) in over 200 years, for twelve years until 1894. He was ordained (consecrated) a bishop (on which day he took up the See of Colchester) by Archibald Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 24 June 1882 at St Albans Cathedral. He died in post, in Brentwood, Essex; he had become a Doctor of Divinity honoris causa (DD) by his university days prior to his consecration.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles James Blomfield", "response": ["*Alfred Blomfield (1833\u20131894), bishop of Colchester", "*Alfred Blomfield (editor), Memoirs of Charles James Blomfield, D.
