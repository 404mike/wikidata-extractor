When their two children were old enough, she began performing publicly. On 12 November 1961, she made her first appearance as a jazz singer, singing English lyrics, and thereafter made constant appearances at home and abroad with her band the Jazz Optimisten Berlin, until the mid-1960s, when her career stalled because of the ruling politburo's cultural policies. Walter Ulbricht, East Germany's hardline communist ruler between 1949 and 1971, clamped down on anything he felt had links with American imperialism, and while jazz was not officially banned, Hohmann has recalled that \"we stopped getting bookings. Concerts would be cancelled at the last minute, with promoters giving excuses like 'we haven't got a sound technician'.\" It was only after Erich Honecker took over as leader of the GDR in 1971 that she was able to resume her performances.Helen Pidd, \"Ruth Hohmann: the first lady of East German jazz sings again\", The Guardian, 2 December 2011."]}, {"page": "Cycling in Greater Manchester", "response": ["In 2015, Manchester was described as a \"terrible cycling city\" by Helen Pidd, the North of England editor of the Guardian newspaper."]}, {"page": "Migrations from Poland since EU accession", "response": ["* Poland: Immigration to UK is back for good life despite economic crisis by Helen Pidd in The Guardian,  27 May 2011."]}, {"page": "Christmas University Challenge", "response": ["| Helen Pidd"]}, {"page": "When the Professor Got Stuck in the Snow", "response": ["Helen Pidd writing in The Guardian praised the novel: \"It is a zippy little farce, littered with bus-stop slang (the professor erroneously believes \"bell end\" to be a compliment) and amusing nods to popular culture.

And that in an age where the sum of man's knowledge is available in an instant via a fibre-optic line, we are perhaps more ignorant than ever we were, and just as likely to be duped as in Shakespeare's day.\""]}]}}
