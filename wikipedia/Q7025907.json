He is best known for his work developing the field of visual culture and for his many books and his widely used textbook on the subject. He was also Deputy Director of the International Association for Visual Culture from 2012-2016 and organized its first conference in 2012. Mirzoeff holds a BA degree from Oxford University and studied for his PhD at the University of Warwick.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Panopticon", "response": ["According to professor Donald Preziosi, the panopticon prison of Bentham resonates with the memory theatre of Giulio Camillo, where the sitting observer is at the centre and the phenomena are categorised in an array, which makes comparison, distinction, contrast and variation legible. Among the architectural references Bentham quoted for his panopticon prison was Ranelagh Gardens, a London pleasure garden with a dome built around 1742. At the center of the rotunda beneath the dome was an elevated platform from which a 360 degrees panorama could be viewed, illuminated through skylights. Professor Nicholas Mirzoeff compares the panopticon with the 19th-century diorama, because the architecture is arranged so that the seer views cells or galleries.

For Mirzoeff, the woman in the photo stares in an invisible direction, and the feeling of opening her lips creates a \"sense of threat and anxiety\". He pointed out that in the classic Hollywood screen setting, \"victims are always isolated like this before they suffer violence.\" However, Sherman's expression can also show that nothing is more vital than mild uncertainty. So anxious, but \"threatening\" feels like too much projection. Untitled Film Still #21 is one of her best early photos, and the style and architectural style of the costume (more \"brighter\" than the viewer in 1978) is an integral part of its lasting appeal as a single photo."]}]}}
