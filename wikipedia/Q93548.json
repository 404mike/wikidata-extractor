The match was played on 28 August, with Southampton running out 4\u20131 winners. The visitors took the lead early on in the second-half through Tadanari Lee, who swept home Billy Sharp's low cross. The away side doubled their advantage in controversial fashion when Sharp scored from a quick free-kick inside the area after referee Oliver Langford had wrongly adjudged defender Mark Roberts to have deliberately passed the ball back to goalkeeper Chris Day, who in-turn picked up the ball. Almost immediately after, Southampton scored once again, Jason Puncheon scoring with a volley from 35 yards. Substitute Michael Thalassitis scored his first goal for the club in injury-time to reduce the deficit, netting from an acute angle after good work down the right from David Gray.
