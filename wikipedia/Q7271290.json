He was one of the team that created the first webcam, the Trojan room coffee pot. Quentin pointed a camera at the coffee pot and wrote the XCoffee client program which allowed the image of the pot to be displayed on a workstation screen. When web browsers gained the ability to display images, the system was modified to make the coffee pot images available over HTTP and thus became the first webcam.Quentin wrote the original VNC client (viewer) and server for the Windows operating system, while at the Olivetti Research Laboratory.He is a regular public speaker and his work has attracted significant media coverage.\nQuentin is also a part-time Senior Research Associate at the University of Cambridge Computer Lab. In 2013 he was a member of the winning team on Christmas University Challenge, representing Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of programmers", "response": ["*Quentin Stafford-Fraser \u2013 authored original VNC viewer, first Windows VNC server, client program for the first webcam"]}, {"page": "Hanlon's razor", "response": ["In 2001, Quentin Stafford-Fraser published two blog entries citing emails from Joseph E.
