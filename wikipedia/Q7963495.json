Scouted by Wally St Pier, Harris was asked to train for West Ham United. After gaining an interest in rock music in his early teens, he realised that he no longer desired to play football professionally. In particular, he was greatly influenced by the Beatles. Harris attended Leyton Senior High School for Boys (now Leyton Sixth Form College) where he studied architecture.", "A keen footballer, Harris played for amateur clubs as a child and was later scouted by Wally St Pier and asked to train for West Ham United, of whom he has been a fan since he was 9 years old. Although he had aspired to play professionally up to that point, Harris would eventually realise that \"it wasn't really what [he] wanted to do.\" Nevertheless, Harris still plays football regularly with his own team, \"Maidonians\", and still supports West Ham, staying in contact with the club and having their crest on his most-used Precision Bass. Harris also plays tennis, and is a photographer."]}, {"page": "Martin Peters", "response": ["Peters was born in Egham Road, off East India Dock Road in Plaistow, Essex, on 8 November 1943 during the Second World War. His father, William Peters, was a Thames Lighterman. Not long after Peters was born he was evacuated with his mother to Shropshire to avoid the bombing of London by the Luftwaffe. When he was seven his family moved to Dagenham, where he attended the local Fanshawe School. In schoolboy football, he played mostly as a centre-half but often as a full-back. He came to the attention of Fulham, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea. Peters did not support any club as a schoolboy and favoured joining Chelsea as his friend Terry Venables, whom he had met playing for Dagenham Schoolboys, had signed for Chelsea. After playing for England schoolboys he was scouted by Wally St Pier for West Ham United. In the summer of 1959 he was signed as a 15-year-old apprentice by West Ham."]}, {"page": "Trevor Brooking", "response": ["Brooking was born in Barking maternity hospital to mother Margaret and father, Henry Charles (known as Harry), who was a police officer in the Metropolitan Police.

His father took him to see his first West Ham United game at Upton Park, a 1\u20131 draw against Liverpool on 19 April 1958, when he was nine years old. Aged fifteen he trained at both Tottenham and Chelsea. However, West Ham manager Ron Greenwood watched him with scout Wally St Pier, and Brooking was offered apprenticeships by all three clubs, with only West Ham allowing him to stay on at school to finish his studies. Despite his parents being offered \u00a3500 and a car by manager Tommy Docherty to gain his signature for Chelsea he remained at school signing an apprenticeship deal with West Ham on 24 July 1965, his parents receiving no fee."]}, {"page": "John Lyall", "response": ["Watched by the club's manager, Ted Fenton, and chief scout Wally St Pier, Lyall was offered a place at West Ham United aged fifteen.

His father secured him a trial for the West Ham United under-16s, and he impressed enough to land himself a place in the academy.

He was playing schoolboy football when he was spotted by West Ham scout Wally St Pier. In 1971, he signed with English First Division club West Ham United when he was 17.  His first start with the Hammers came on 30 October 1971, against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park following a late injury to Geoff Hurst. He scored on his debut, a 3\u20130 victory, but despite this auspicious first game, he made only eleven first team appearances over three seasons.Belton, Brian (2006).

He won three England youth team caps and played in both legs of the 1963 Youth Cup final against Liverpool. Britt made his full debut for West Ham in May 1963 against Blackburn Rovers. Finding opportunities limited behind strikers Johnny Byrne and Geoff Hurst he still managed four goals from eleven appearances in season 1963\u201364. Serious injury then struck when during a training session he suffered what was thought to be cruciate ligament damage but later proved to be a chipped bone in the knee joint. Failing to make a single appearance the following season he did score three goals from 14 appearances the next season; mostly aided by using his left leg and avoiding jumping using his damaged right leg."]}, {"page": "John Cartwright (footballer)", "response": ["Born in Brixworth, Cartwright went to Parmiter's School in Bethnal Green.

He captained West Ham's Youth Cup winning side of 1963; the first black player to lead a first-class side to a major trophy. Charles made his debut for the first team in May 1963 against Blackburn Rovers. Injury prevented Charles from being part of the West Ham teams which won the 1964 FA Cup Final and the 1965 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. Nevertheless, playing most of his games alongside Bobby Moore, he made 142 appearances for West Ham in all competitions scoring two goals; one a League Cup game against Grimsby Town, the other the single West Ham goal in a famous Manchester United 6\u20131 victory at Upton Park in which Manchester United won the 1966-67 Football League trophy.

Pratt had been a board member since 1941. One of his first jobs was to oversee the transition of managers from Charlie Paynter to Ted Fenton. Pratt moved Fenton into The Boleyn Ground several months before the anticipated end of Paynter's managership, to prepare him for the job. It was with Pratt's approval that Fenton, with Wally St Pier, set-up the youth teams and training methods which led to The Academy of Football and the establishment of training facilities at Chadwell Heath. In 1961 Pratt was responsible for the removal of Fenton and the appointment of Ron Greenwood. He retired from the chairmanship in May 1979, aged 74, after 29 years in the post becoming club president and handing over to Len Cearns. He died 27 March 1984.West Ham handbook 1996-97 p137"]}]}}
