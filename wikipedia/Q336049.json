After serving in the Peninsular War and the War of 1812, he commanded the 98th Regiment of Foot during the First Opium War and then commanded a brigade during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He went on to command the Highland Brigade at the Battle of Alma and with his \"thin red line of Highlanders\" he repulsed the Russian attack on Balaclava during the Crimean War. At an early stage of the Indian Mutiny, he became Commander-in-Chief, India and, in that role, he relieved and then evacuated Lucknow and, after attacking and decisively defeating Tatya Tope at the Second Battle of Cawnpore, captured Lucknow again. Whilst still commander-in-chief he dealt with the \"White Mutiny\" among East India Company troops, and organised the army sent east in the Second Opium War.\nHistorian Adrian Greenwood argued in a 2015 biography of Campbell that he was a much more effective and significant commander than previously thought.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde (1792\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "Crimean War", "response": ["** Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde"]}, {"page": "List of biographers", "response": ["*Adrian Greenwood (En, 1973\u20132016) \u2013 Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde"]}, {"page": "Colin Campbell, baron Clyde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde"]}, {"page": "The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)", "response": ["Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde is said to have told his men, \"There is no retreat from here, men.

Convention dictated that the line should be four deep. However, Campbell felt he had insufficiently trained men to form square, and met the charge head on with the two-deep firing line. As the Russian cavalry approached, the Turks on the flanks broke and fled. The 93rd discharged two volleys: at 800 and 500 yards respectively. They did not get a chance to discharge one at point-blank range as the Russians turned away. Accounts of the Highlanders state that they started forward for a counter-charge before the final volley, but Sir Colin stopped them with a cry of \"93rd, damn you Highlanders for all that eagerness!\"B.
