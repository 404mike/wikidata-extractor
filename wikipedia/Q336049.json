After serving in the Peninsular War and the War of 1812, he commanded the 98th Regiment of Foot during the First Opium War and then commanded a brigade during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He went on to command the Highland Brigade at the Battle of Alma and with his \"thin red line of Highlanders\" he repulsed the Russian attack on Balaclava during the Crimean War. At an early stage of the Indian Mutiny, he became Commander-in-Chief, India and, in that role, he relieved and then evacuated Lucknow and, after attacking and decisively defeating Tatya Tope at the Second Battle of Cawnpore, captured Lucknow again. Whilst still commander-in-chief he dealt with the \"White Mutiny\" among East India Company troops, and organised the army sent east in the Second Opium War.\nHistorian Adrian Greenwood argued in a 2015 biography of Campbell that he was a much more effective and significant commander than previously thought.", "link_mentions": {}}}
