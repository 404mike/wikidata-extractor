He was a Factory Development Officer in the Ministry of Supply. On 22 February 1944 there was an accident at the arms factory at ROF Kirkby, in Lancashire (now Merseyside) 19 workers, mainly women, were filling fuses when one exploded, killing one woman immediately and wounding two others, one of whom later died of her injuries. The fuse had exploded because of a defective striker and Bywater realised that the whole building, which contained 12,000 highly explosive fuses, was in danger of igniting. He led three other volunteers in the hazardous work of clearing the wrecked factory of 12,724 fuses over the next three days, plus another 4,000 which were believed to be defective.\nThe award of the Bywater's George Cross was published in the London Gazette on 26 September 1944 while his George Medal, for bravery in clearing a factory at the same site in 1944, was published on 18 September 1945.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in April 2005", "response": ["*Arthur Bywater, 91, British civil servant, winner of the George Cross."]}, {"page": "Richard Bywater", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Bywater"]}, {"page": "Richard Arthur Samuel Bywater", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Bywater"]}, {"page": "King's Norton Boys' School", "response": ["* Arthur Bywater GC GM, the only civilian to have been awarded the GC and the GM"]}]}}
