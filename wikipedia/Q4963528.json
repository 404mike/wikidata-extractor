He turned professional in 1994 and became a member of the European Tour in 1997. He performed steadily for his first six seasons on the Tour, and won the 2000 Peugeot Open de Espa\u00f1a. In 2003, despite not winning a tournament, he had his best season by far to that time, finishing ninth on the European Tour Order of Merit. The highlights of his season included finishing in a tie for sixth at The Open Championship, and placing third in the European Tour's tour championship, the Volvo Masters, as well as two second places in lower profile events and playing on the winning Great Britain and Ireland team in the Seve Trophy. His second European Tour win came in 2004 at the ANZ Championship and later that year he became the first Englishman to be medalist at the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament. In 2005 he played on both the U.S.-based PGA Tour and the European Tour and in 2006 he concentrated more on the PGA Tour, making only a handful of appearances in Europe. Davis had two solid seasons on the PGA Tour in 2007 and 2008 where he finished inside the top 100 on the money list both times, including a runner-up at the Legends Reno-Tahoe Open.\n2009 was a very consistent season for Davis. The season included 5th-place finishes at The Players Championship and the Valero Texas Open, followed by a third straight top 5 finish at the HP Byron Nelson Championship where he matched his best finish on the PGA Tour when he was runner-up behind Rory Sabbatini. He finished the season 43rd on the money list.\nIn April 2010 Davis called a two-stroke penalty on himself on the first play-off hole on Sunday to hand Jim Furyk a victory at the Verizon Heritage. Davis later received much praise for his decision which cost him a potential first PGA Tour victory. Davis finished second again later in 2010 at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, three shots behind Zach Johnson.\nDavis has featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Furyk", "response": ["| Brian Davis", "| Brian Davis"]}, {"page": "Stephen Clemence", "response": ["Clemence is the brother-in-law of former footballer Dougie Freedman, married to his sister Sarah, and of golfer Brian Davis, married to Julie."]}, {"page": "David Howell (golfer)", "response": ["| Thomas Bj\u00f8rn,  Brian Davis"]}, {"page": "AT&T Byron Nelson", "response": ["| 2009 ||  Rory Sabbatini || style=\"text-align: center; background: #ACE1AF\"|261 || align=center|\u221219 || 2 strokes ||  Brian Davis || align=right|1,170,000 || align=right|6,500,000 || "]}, {"page": "Thomas Bj\u00f8rn", "response": ["| Brian Davis,  David Howell", "| Brian Davis,  David Howell"]}, {"page": "British Masters", "response": ["| 2005 ||  Thomas Bj\u00f8rn || align=center|282 || align=center|\u22126 || Playoff ||  Brian Davis David Howell || Forest of Arden ||"]}, {"page": "Open de Espa\u00f1a", "response": ["| 2000 ||  Brian Davis || align=center|274 || align=center|\u221214 || 3 strokes ||  Markus Brier || align=center|166,660"]}, {"page": "Woody Austin", "response": ["| Brian Davis"]}, {"page": "Bradley Dredge", "response": ["| Fredrik Andersson,  Brian Davis, Andrew Marshall", "| Fredrik Andersson,  Brian Davis, Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Open de Portugal", "response": ["| 2003 || EUR ||  Freddie Jacobson || align=center|283 || align=center|\u22125 || 1 stroke ||  Brian Davis Jamie Donaldson Bradley Dredge || Vale do Lobo"]}, {"page": "Rory Sabbatini", "response": ["In May 2009 Sabbatini captured his fifth PGA Tour title by winning the HP Byron Nelson Championship by two strokes over Brian Davis.
