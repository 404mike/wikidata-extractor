He discovered a protozoan parasite transmitted by insects, later named Trypanosoma brucei after him.

In 1828, James Annersley described amoebiasis, protozoal infections of the intestines and the liver, though the pathogen, Entamoeba histolytica, was not discovered until 1873 by Friedrich L\u00f6sch. James Paget discovered the intestinal nematode Trichinella spiralis in humans in 1835. James McConnell described the human liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, in 1875. Algernon Thomas and Rudolf Leuckart independently made the first discovery of the life cycle of a trematode, the sheep liver fluke, by experiment in 1881\u20131883. In 1877 Patrick Manson discovered the life cycle of the filarial worms that cause elephantiasis transmitted by mosquitoes. Manson further predicted that the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, had a mosquito vector, and persuaded Ronald Ross to investigate. Ross confirmed that the prediction was correct in 1897\u20131898. At the same time, Giovanni Battista Grassi and others described the malaria parasite's life cycle stages in Anopheles mosquitoes. Ross was controversially awarded the 1902 Nobel prize for his work, while Grassi was not. In 1903, David Bruce identified the protozoan parasite and the tsetse fly vector of African trypanosomiasis."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*David Bruce (1855\u20131931), Scottish pathologist and microbiologist who investigated Malta fever (now called brucellosis) and discovered trypanosomes"]}, {"page": "David Bruce", "response": ["David Bruce may refer to:", "* David Bruce (actor) (1914\u20131976), American film actor", "* David Bruce (composer) (born 1970), British composer", "* David Bruce (musician), Australian singer, percussionist and composer", "* David Bruce (bridge) (1900\u20131965), American contract bridge player in the 1930s", "* David Bruce (physician) (fl. 1660s), Scottish physician", "* David Bruce (microbiologist) (1855\u20131931), Scottish pathologist and microbiologist", "* David II of Scotland (1324\u20131371), David Bruce, King of Scots, son of King Robert the Bruce", "* David Bruce (captain) (1816\u20131903), British master mariner", "* David Bruce (minister) (1824\u20131911), Presbyterian minister, journalist", "* David Bruce (brewer) (born 1948), British entrepreneur, founder of the Firkin Brewery pub chain", "* David Bruce (ice hockey) (born 1964), Canadian National Hockey League player", "* David Bruce (inventor), American industrialist and inventor", "* David Bruce Winery, an American winery"]}, {"page": "African trypanosomiasis", "response": ["The causative agent and vector were identified in 1903 by David Bruce, and the subspecies of the protozoa were differentiated in 1910.
