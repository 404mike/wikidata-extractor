During 1921, interest in cricket reached an all-time high, with over 250,000 people attending Old Trafford and over 4,500 members. 1922 was a year of contradictions, a strong team winning seven out of fifteen matches by an innings, but still managing to lose seven and finish 5th; that season Cec Parkin and Lawrence Cook mustered 308\u00a0wickets between them and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs.

After being underused in the first Test, Cec Parkin wrote an article highly critical of Gilligan which appeared in the press; Parkin never played for England again. Additionally, while  Gilligan was generally popular for his cheerful and friendly approach, the press judged Fender to be the better captain. However, the cricket authorities at Lord's disapproved of Fender's unconventional tactics and approach.McKinstry, p. 226.

For the county he took 33 wickets at a bowling average of 26.54, with best figures of 7/55, one of two five wicket hauls he took. His best figures came in his debut match against Middlesex, with the 7/55 coming in the Middlesex second-innings and following on from the 5/32 in their first-innings. These figures were the best by any player on debut in the County Championship at that time, it would be a record which would stand for 14 years, until it was beaten by Cec Parkin who took match figures of 14/99 on his Lancashire County Cricket Club debut in 1914Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2005, p. 784.

The three most prominent establishment figures were Lord Harris, Lord Hawke and Pelham Warner who were determined that cricket in the 1920s should continue as before the war under the leadership of amateurs like themselves. As Derek Birley put it, they were intent on \"preserving the natural order of things\".Birley, p. 217. When the Lancashire professional Cec Parkin had the \"temerity\" to criticise the England captain Arthur Gilligan, Warner denounced him as \"the first cricketing Bolshevik\".Birley, p. 219. It backfired on Warner. Even among his own amateur brethren there were many who asserted that Gilligan was a waste of space whose selection over Surrey captain Percy Fender had been done because of \"petty jealousies between MCC and Surrey\".Birley, p. 220.", "Although the county had numerous quality players, the essential factors in their success were professionalism and teamwork. Among their best players were England wicket-keeper George Duckworth; batsmen Ernest Tyldesley, Charlie Hallows, Harry Makepeace and Eddie Paynter; and bowlers Ted McDonald, Cec Parkin and Dick Tyldesley.", "In a similar vein, taking 250 wickets in a season was also considered a remarkable achievement and this was done six times, all between 1928 and 1932 and all by the same player, Tich Freeman. His highest tally was 304 in 1928. Tom Goddard took 248 wickets in 1937 and the next highest was 228 by Maurice Tate in 1925. There were thirty instances in all of bowlers taking 200 wickets in a season. Freeman accounted for eight of these and Charlie Parker five. Goddard, Tate and Hedley Verity did it three times. The other eight instances were by Alf Gover (twice), Cec Parkin (twice), Alec Kennedy, Fred Root, Ted McDonald and George Macaulay. Ten wickets in an innings was achieved 22 times, including the world record analysis of ten for 10 by Verity in 1932. The next best returns were ten for 18 by George Geary in 1929 and ten for 36 by Verity, again, in 1931. Freeman took three tens, one in each season from 1929 to 1931. Verity was the only other bowler to do it twice. Two Australian tourists, Arthur Mailey in 1921 and Clarrie Grimmett in 1930, are among the other seventeen."]}, {"page": "Ren\u00e9 MacColl", "response": ["MacColl was the son of the Scot Dugald Sutherland MacColl, keeper of the Tate Gallery and Wallace Collection, and his French wife Andr\u00e9e Ad\u00e8le D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Jeanne, he was born at Brentford in January 1905. He was educated at University College School, before going up to Lincoln College, Oxford.

Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed without scoring in the Oxford first innings by Cec Parkin, while in their second innings he was dismissed for 4 runs by the same bowler. MacColl spent two years at Oxford, but left without obtaining a degree, instead finding work in Belgium at Antwerp with a British firm which dealt in secondhand jute bags, but left sixteen months later when the firm was closed down."]}]}}
