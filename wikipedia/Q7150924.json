His book The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses won the Caldecott Medal in 1979. Lakota scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn (Cook-Lynn, 1998) and Lakota librarian Doris Seale find his retellings inaccurate.  Displeasure in them led the American Indian Library Association to ask the American Library Association to withdraw \"Native American Month\" posters and bookmarks with his art on them in 2007. ALA complied with the request, signaling the respect accorded to scholars and practitioners who work with Native populations. However, the debate over Goble's work is far from one-sided. Many prominent Native American authors still support his contribution to the field of study. Authors\u2014such as Joe Medicine Crow\u201cHis [Goble\u2019s] art is tremendous because he is able to recreate the traditional forms with great accuracy and detail. The designs he draws are completely authentic and his colors are the same ones that were used by the old-timers before the reservation days. He is able to recreate the spirit of the old stories with his illustrations and words. The stories he selects are all important and help explain our Indian traditions. When he retells a story he captures the most important parts. He also has the ability to select some of the best writings of our old-timers.\u201d (Absaroka), Vivian Arviso Deloria\u201cI met Paul Goble and deeply appreciate his dedication to recapture Lakota stories... He is quiet and humble in nature and he never neglects to give tribute to his native sources and references... It is an appreciation deeply felt for a man [Goble] whose work is now the many fine books that are in the hands of young people, both Lakota and non-Lakota. Thank you Paul, for your work all these years to renew our understanding of stories from the Buffalo Days.\u201c  (Navajo), Joseph Bruchac\u201cFew non-Indians have immersed themselves as deeply in the histories and traditions of the Native nations of the Great Plains as Paul Goble. Through his distinguished career as an artist and a storyteller, he\u2019s always paid close attention to the details that often elude those who try to write about or illustrate Native American stories but lack his knowledge and desire for veracity.\u201d (Abenaki), Lauren Waukau-Villagomez\u201cAs a result of his [Goble\u2019s] study and hard work, his stories and illustrations are culturally correct and significant. His depiction of Native Americans is respectful and fair\u2026. His interpretation of Native history and legends has held up over and over for than a generation of readers.\u201d  (Menominee), Robert Lewis\u201cIn reading Paul Goble, I am reminded again of the power of stories\u2026. They remain inside of us like dreams that need to be remembered. Paul Goble has found one of these dreams and with poignant words given a new vision of Red Cloud\u2019s War\u2026\u201d  (Cherokee/ Navaho/Apache) and Albert White Hat Sr.\u201cBut what I admire most is that he [Goble] is the only non-Indian I know who has kept a Lakota flavor in his thought, in his stories. He doesn\u2019t westernize the words and he has not watered down the stories to cater to non-Indians. More than a decade ago I even translated his book, Buffalo Woman, into Lakota so that our Sioux people can hear his storytelling. He tells his stories as if we were sitting around a tipi campfire in the olden-days.\u201d  (Lakota)\u2014have publicly stated their support of Goble bringing traditional Native American stories to the public\u2019s attention, going so far as praising his attention to detail and his use of primary sources."]}, {"page": "List of people from Rapid City, South Dakota", "response": ["*Paul Goble, born in Heslemere, England; author and illustrator of children's books residing in Rapid City"]}, {"page": "The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses", "response": ["The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses, written and illustrated by Paul Goble, is a children's picture book originally released by Bradbury Press in 1978.
