His primary areas of intellectual interest included cultural studies, critical analysis of popular culture, media semiotics, and television studies.He was the author of eight academic books, including Power Plays, Power Works (1993), Understanding Popular Culture (1989), Reading the Popular (1989), and the influential Television Culture (1987). Fiske was also a media critic, examining how cultural meaning has been created in American society, and how debates over issues such as race have been handled in different media.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Postmodernism", "response": ["Structuralism was a philosophical movement developed by French academics in the 1950s, partly in response to French existentialism, and often interpreted in relation to modernism and high modernism. Thinkers who have been called \"structuralists\" include the anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, and the semiotician Algirdas Greimas. The early writings of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and the literary theorist Roland Barthes have also been called \"structuralist\". Those who began as structuralists but became post-structuralists include Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jean Baudrillard, and Gilles Deleuze. Other post-structuralists include Jacques Derrida, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Julia Kristeva, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. The American cultural theorists, critics, and intellectuals whom they influenced include Judith Butler, John Fiske, Rosalind Krauss, Avital Ronell, and Hayden White."]}, {"page": "Madonna", "response": ["Madonna's use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism. As Roger Chapman documents in Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices, Volume 1 (2010), she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations, social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit, sexual imagery and lyrics, religious symbolism, and otherwise \"irreverent\" behavior in her live performances. The Times wrote that she had \"started a revolution amongst women in music\u00a0... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.\" Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one's social relations. In Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture (2009), the authors noted that Madonna, as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, Madonna represents woman's occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corv\u00e9e allotted to women. Professor Sut Jhally has referred to Madonna as \"an almost sacred feminist icon.\""]}, {"page": "Sociology of sport", "response": ["Resistance is a key concept in cultural studies, which describes how subordinate groups engage in particular cultural practices to resist their domination. Resistance can be overt and deliberate or latent and unconscious, but always counters the norms and conventions of the dominant groups.

Irwin (227) laments that intertextuality has eclipsed allusion as an object of literary study while lacking the latter term's clear definition. Linda Hutcheon argues that excessive interest in intertextuality rejects the role of the author, because intertextuality can be found \"in the eye of the beholder\" and does not entail a communicator's intentions. By contrast, in A Theory of Parody Hutcheon notes parody always features an author who actively encodes a text as an imitation with critical difference.Hutcheon, Linda. A Theory of Parody: The Teachings of Twentieth-Century Art Forms. New York: Methuen, 1985. However, there have also been attempts at more closely defining different types of intertextuality. The Australian media scholar John Fiske has made a distinction between what he labels 'vertical' and 'horizontal' intertextuality. Horizontal intertextuality denotes references that are on the 'same level', i.e. when books make references to other books, whereas vertical intertextuality is found when, say, a book makes a reference to film or song or vice versa. Similarly, Linguist Norman Fairclough distinguishes between 'manifest intertextuality' and 'constitutive intertextuality'.Fairclough, Norman (1992). Discourse and Social Change. Cambridge: Polity Press, 117. The former signifies intertextual elements such as presupposition, negation, parody, irony, etc. The latter signifies the interrelationship of discursive features in a text, such as structure, form, or genre. Constitutive Intertextuality is also referred to interdiscursivity,Agger, Gunhild Intertextuality Revisited: Dialogues and Negotiations in Media Studies. Canadian Journal of Aesthetics, 4, 1999. though, generally  interdiscursivity refers to relations between larger formations of texts."]}, {"page": "Henry Jenkins", "response": ["Jenkins graduated from Georgia State University with a B.A. in Political Science and Journalism.

This participatory engagement is seen as increasingly important given the enhanced interactive and networked communication capabilities of digital and internet technologies. Jenkins has described the creative social phenomena arising from as participatory culture and is considered one of the main academics specializing in this topic - see, for instance, his 2015 book Participatory Culture in a Networked Era: A Conversation on Youth, Learning, Commerce, and Politics co-authored with Mimi Ito and danah boyd. Jenkins has highlighted the work of media scholar John Fiske as a major influence, particularly in this area of participatory culture."]}, {"page": "Susan Bordo", "response": ["While situated within feminist and gender studies frameworks, Bordo's theories also stem from a cultural studies approach where the power of cultural phenomena such as television, advertising and popular magazines are analyzed in terms of means of domination and of resistance. While certain cultural theorists, for example John Fiske, who wrote Television Culture (1990), see elements of culture like television as \"demonstrating the way representational codes and techniques shape our perception\" but also as a means for resistance, where audience members could \"decode\" such messages and thus be able to \"think resistantly about their lives\",Leitch, p. 1026. Bordo sees cultural coding as a more pernicious, binding and overwhelming force. For Bordo \"the rules of femininity have come to be culturally transmitted more and more through the deployment of standardized visual images\";Bordo, \"The Body and the Reproduction of Femininity\", p. 17. cultural transmitters such as television and print media work insidiously to \"impose models of bodily beauty that get construed as freely chosen options by those victimized by them\"."]}, {"page": "History of media studies", "response": ["As a response to the previous emphasis upon media effects, from the 1970s researchers became interested in how audiences make sense of media texts. The \"uses and gratifications\" model, associated with Jay Blumler and Elihu Katz, reflected this growing interest in the 'active audience'. One such example of this type of research was conducted by Hodge and Tripp, and separately Palmer, about how school-children make sense of the Australian soap opera Prisoner. They found that pupils could identify with the prisoners: they were \"shut in\", separated from their friends and wouldn't be there had they not been made to be, etc. Also, the children could compare the wardens to their teachers: \"the hard-bitten old [one], the soft new one, the one you could take advantage of...\" John Fiske summarises:"]}, {"page": "John Fiske", "response": ["John Fiske may refer to:", "* John Fiske (philosopher) (1842\u20131901), American philosopher and historian", "* John Fiske (media scholar) (born 1939), author and Professor Emeritus at the University Wisconsin-Madison"]}, {"page": "John Hartley (academic)", "response": ["He published his first book, Reading Television, in 1978.

A collection of scholarly articles, The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory edited by Cathy Schwichtenberg, was published in late 1992. The justification the creation of studies and bibliography focused on Madonna and validity that they have is a subject of debate among scholars and academics. These studies analyzed several topics, but mostly Madonna studies involved in the study of gender, sexuality, and the mass media. One of her advocates is Annalee Newitz saying that to \"the university communities Madonna occupies a definite place in the curriculum of post-Western cultures in universities worldwide\". Professor and media scholar John Fiske explained that all cultural studies focus primarily on finding a hidden meaning within a social aspect\u00a0\u2014for example, a Madonna video\u2014 so it takes a more comprehensive analysis to provide an appropriate context\u00a0\u2014in this case, on the work of singer\u2014. Similarly, the American psychologist Susan Fiske, noted that \"cultural studies about Madonna only analyze texts and how your audience uses the material to relate to the social construction that is Madonna. French academic Georges Claude Guilbert, who has written three books about Madonna, said in one of them \"is a bit excessive admiration imply that scholars have for Madonna is the result of a common hostility to censorship\".

Fiske states that excorporation is \u201cthe process by which the subordinate make their own culture out of the resources and commodities provided by the dominant system\u201d.Fiske, J. (1989). Understanding Popular Culture. Boston: Unwin Hyman. Fiske believes this idea to be central to the study of popular culture. He argues that in an industrialized world, the subordinated group has only the use of resources supplied to them by the dominant group from which to create their own subcultures and social commodities. In his theory, Fiske refutes the idea of folk culture, any sort of \u2018authentic\u2019 culture, saying that it does not exist in such a society. In other words, the subordinate deals with what is available. This requires the study of popular culture to not only look at the various cultural commodities, but the ways in which the individual uses them as well. Fiske sees the different uses of commodities to be most interesting. The excorporation of resources is generally more varied and creative than the original.", "The 1960s and the 1970s were the start of crafting jeans for individual taste, based on the fashion and social movements at the time.

But in this case Fiske contrasts iconic signs with \"verbal language\" (p. 78). As an example, he explains how prehistoric cave paintings of animals are often seen as graceful and moving. However, in 1960, Margaret Abercrombie claimed that the paintings are, in fact, depictions of dead animals. Thus, if we accept Abercrombie's claim, we can argue that our modern culture, where we value living animals and only rarely encounter dead ones, has led us to aberrant decoding of the paintings."]}, {"page": "Cultural studies", "response": ["In the US, prior to the emergence of British Cultural Studies, several versions of cultural analysis had emerged largely from pragmatic and liberal-pluralist philosophical traditions.Lindlof & Taylor, 2002, p.\u00a060.

On this view, a consumer can appropriate, actively rework, or challenge the meanings circulated through cultural texts.
