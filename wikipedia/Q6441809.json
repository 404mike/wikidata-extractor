The next day, Manager Jackie McNamara said both Oyenuga and Butcher had impressed during the trial and hinted they might earn a contract. On 4 July 2013, Butcher signed a contract until May 2015 with Dundee United. He made his competitive debut for the Terrors in the opening Scottish Premiership match versus Partick Thistle at Firhill Stadium in Glasgow. The match ended 0\u20130. Butcher started in an away league match against United's local Tayside rivals St Johnstone but was sent off for a last man challenge on striker Stevie May. May converted the resulting penalty. He would then only make one further appearance for the first team that season. Butcher was soon sidelined with a fractured foot, ruling him out of the remainder of the season, but the club's assistant coach Simon Donnelly insisted he could make an impact the following season."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 St Johnstone F.C. season", "response": ["|22|||| FW|| Kudus Oyenuga", "| Kudus Oyenuga"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 January 2012 || Kudus Oyenuga||St Johnstone||End of 2011\u201312 season", "| 15 August 2011 || Kudus Oyenuga||Bury||September 2011"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Bury F.C. season", "response": ["| Kudus Oyenuga"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 St Johnstone F.C. season", "response": ["|  Kudus Oyenuga"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Veikkausliiga players", "response": ["* Kudus Oyenuga \u2013 MyPa \u2013 2011"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Kudus Oyenuga"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football transfers summer 2014", "response": ["| LoanDundee United striker Kudus Oyenuga joins Cowdenbeath, BBC Sport"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Kudus Oyenuga"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 6 July 2015 || MF || Kudus Oyenuga || Dundee United || Free || ", "| Kudus Oyenuga", "|Kudus Oyenuga"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Kudus Oyenuga ||  Hartlepool United || Free"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Greenock Morton F.C. season", "response": ["After a successful trial in a friendly against Kilbirnie Ladeside, Morton signed English striker Kudus Oyenuga on a one-year contract.", "Kudus Oyenuga signed a contract extension until the end of the season.", "Four members of the first team squad were released; Kudus Oyenuga, Conor Pepper, Jon Scullion and Jamie McDonagh.", "| Kudus Oyenuga", "| Kudus Oyenuga", "|FW||style=\"text-align:left\"| Kudus Oyenuga || 11 || 18 || 3 || 4 || 1 || 1", "*Kudus Oyenuga, Lewis Strapp & Scott Miller - 3"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 8 August 2016 || MF || Kudus Oyenuga || Greenock Morton || Free || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Greenock Morton F.C. season", "response": ["| Kudus Oyenuga"]}]}}
