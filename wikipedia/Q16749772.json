Signed by Chesterfield in May of that year, Holmes remained with the Derbyshire club for just one season before being signed by Division One side Sheffield United in May 1931 for \u00a31,750.Making his debut for United in October 1931 in an away fixture at Manchester City, Holmes became a regular in the Blades defence for the next four years. Holmes was regarded as a robust and tough tackling defender with a fiery temper, highlighted when a referee ruled out a goal Holmes had scored, only for the defender to pick up the official and \"shake him like a dog would a rat\" according to press reports. Having missed very few fixtures, Holmes was sidelined by injury at the start of the 1935\u201336 season and was replaced by Tom Johnson. Despite Holmes regaining his fitness, Johnson's impressive form meant that by December 1935 he was firmly established as first choice, resulting in Holmes making only occasional appearances from then on.In May 1936 Holmes moved to West Ham United for \u00a3750 where he played for a season, before joining Reading in July 1937. Holmes remained with the club following the onset of World War II, but having made two guest appearances for his former club Chesterfield in 1940, he retired from playing and returned to his former profession as a miner.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Holmes", "response": ["* Jimmy Holmes (footballer, born 1908) (1908\u20131971), English footballer", "* Jimmy Holmes (footballer, born 1953), Irish footballer", "* Jimmy Holmes (trade unionist) (1850-1911), English hosiery industry trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Holmes (footballer born 1908)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Holmes (footballer, born 1908)"]}]}}
