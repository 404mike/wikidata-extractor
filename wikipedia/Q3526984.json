He did not score a run, take a wicket or take a catch.Educated at Harrow, McMaster was one of several club cricketers who were selected for an under-strength England team that toured South Africa in 1888-89. He played as a batsman in most of the provincial matches, none of which was first-class, with a highest score of 34 not out against South Western Districts. He was selected for the second and final Test match, in Cape Town, starting on 25 March 1889. England batted first, scoring 292, with McMaster, batting at number nine, making a first-ball duck. He did not bowl in South Africa's two innings of 47 and 43, with Johnny Briggs taking 15 for 28; the match ended on the second day.Two seasons later he umpired three first-class matches in South Africa. His son, Michael, also played in a single first-class match.", "link_mentions": {}}}
