He was ranked UK number 1 in 1987 and from 1989 to 1994. He reached a career-high ATP world ranking of 54 from 17 April 1995 to 23 April 1995.During his career he won two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, Wimbledon in 1987 and the Australian Open in 1991, with tennis partner Jo Durie as well as one singles title and three men's doubles titles.  After retiring from the professional circuit, he served as the captain of Britain's Davis Cup team from 2004 to 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 19", "response": ["*  1962   \u2013 Jeremy Bates, English tennis player"]}, {"page": "Tim Henman", "response": ["From July 1992 to July 1993, Henman grew six inches to six feet one, and went from seven stones to nine stones in weight. This would prove important for his career, as he acknowledged: \"As a junior I had pretty good technique. Now I've got the strength and reach, and on the serve that has helped tremendously.\" Henman was ranked 774th in the world at the beginning of 1993, but by July he had come close to the top 600. In July, Henman received a wildcard to participate in the ATP Challenger tournament in Bristol, England. In the first round, he defeated Colombian Miguel Tobon, ranked 257th, in straight sets, 6\u20130, 6\u20133. In the second round he met the Frenchman Eric Winogradsky and defeated him also in straight sets, 7\u20136, 6\u20133. Henman was defeated in the quarter-final by British player Chris Bailey, 6\u20132, 6\u20131. By November Henman's rank had increased to 415th. Henman's next tournament was the Volkswagen National Championships in Telford, England; he reached the quarter-final but lost to top-ranked British male player Jeremy Bates, 7\u20135, 7\u20136. As 1993 drew to a close, Henman played one last tournament in Israel, which he won.", "By September Henman was ranked 146th, and in the same month he returned to the Far East. His first tournament in the Far East was the Seoul Open. Henman lost in the second round to Korean Kim Nam-Hoon, who was ranked outside the top 700. At the Singapore Challenger, he reached the quarterfinals and lost to fellow Brit Chris Wilkinson. He was forced to retire in the third set against Wilkinson when he fell and received a blow to his leg. When he returned to England not long after the tournament, it was revealed that Henman had broken his ankle in three places and would not play another tournament until February 1995. In fact, he was not fully recovered until May. While injured, his ranking went from 146th to 272nd in the world. That year's grass season would prove highly successful for Henman; he reached the semi-finals at the Annenheim Open, later at the Queen's Club Championship he reached the second round after defeating German Martin Sinner, and in Nottingham he reached the quarter-finals, his first quarter-final in the ATP tour. His success in these tournaments increased his ranking from 272nd to 219th. To make matters better for Henman, he won his first match ever in a Grand Slam event at the Wimbledon Championship over Kenyan Paul Wekesa in straight sets, 7\u20136, 6\u20130, 6\u20134. However, Henman's winning streak did not last long, and in the second round he met Sampras, and was defeated 6\u20132, 6\u20133, 7\u20136. Two days later he partnered Jeremy Bates in the first round of the doubles at Wimbledon but the pair became the first players in the Open era to be defaulted at Wimbledon after Henman accidentally hit a ballgirl on the side of head with a ball, having lashed out with his racket in frustration after losing a point to a net cord in the fourth set tie-break of their match against Jeff Tarango and Henrik Holm. Because he hit the ball in anger, the referee Alan Mills ruled that this was an automatic disqualification for unsportsmanlike conduct. He was very apologetic about the incident, presenting the girl with a bunch of flowers.Ballgirl Takes Center Court , Washington Post, 30 June 1995 The rest of the grass season was fairly successful for Henman, he appeared at the Manchester Open and reached the semi-final at the Newcastle Open. At the end of the grass season, Henman's rank had risen to 150th in the world."]}, {"page": "List of Wimbledon Open Era champions", "response": [" |  Jo Durie  Jeremy Bates   "]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Jeremy Bates \u2013 BBC Radio 2012\u2013present"]}, {"page": "List of Australian Open champions", "response": [" |  Jo Durie  Jeremy Bates"]}, {"page": "List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions", "response": ["| 1987 ||  Jeremy Bates   Jo Durie ||  Darren Cahill   Nicole Provis || 7\u20136(12\u201310), 6\u20133"]}, {"page": "Henri Leconte", "response": ["|  Jeremy Bates   Kevin Curren"]}, {"page": "Queen's Club Championships", "response": ["| 1990 ||  Jeremy Bates   Kevin Curren ||   Henri Leconte   Ivan Lendl || 6\u20132, 7\u20136"]}, {"page": "John Lloyd (tennis)", "response": ["In 2006, Lloyd was appointed the captain of Great Britain's Davis Cup team, replacing Jeremy Bates.\"Lloyd is new GB Davis Cup captain\" BBC Sport, 9 August 2006 Lloyd's reign started very well, with successive victories taking the team back into the World Group, but after the retirement of both Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman in 2007 the team suffered five successive defeats, their worst run in Davis Cup history, to drop back down to the third tier of the competition.
