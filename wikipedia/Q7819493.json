He played 134 games for Small Heath in the Football Alliance and the Football League.\nBorn in Small Heath, Birmingham, Hands played for several clubs in the local area before signing for Small Heath, then playing in the Football Alliance, in December 1890. He went on to make nearly 150 appearances for the club. The strength of Hands's game lay in his speed. In Small Heath's first Football League season, in which they won the inaugural Second Division championship, he was part of a forward line who all reached double figures of goals scored. He also contributed to their runners-up spot and promotion to the First Division the following year, and played for a further two years in the top flight. At the end of the 1895\u201396 season, he walked out of the club over a dispute about money and never played league football again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Birmingham City F.C. players", "response": ["Bob McRoberts, Billy Beer, George Liddell, Merrick, Garry Pendrey, Francis and Gary Rowett all went on to manage the team.

Eight men listed here played in Birmingham's pioneering venture into club football in Europe in the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and ten played on the losing side in the 1956 FA Cup Final (an eleventh, Roy Warhurst, missed the match through injury). In more recent times, Paul Tait scored the first golden goal to decide a Wembley cup final, against Carlisle United in the 1995 Football League Trophy. Geoff Horsfield scored the extra-time equaliser that took the 2002 First Division play-off final into a shootout; Paul Devlin and Stan Lazaridis converted their spot-kicks as Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time. Seven men listed here, including captain Stephen Carr and goalscorer Nikola \u017digi\u0107, took the field as Birmingham won the 2011 League Cup; another two were unused substitutes.

Edwards made his debut in the Second Division on the opening day of the 1896\u201397 season in a 3\u20131 win at home to Newcastle United, and played four of the next six games, scoring once, before losing his place and not regaining it.Matthews, p. 144.

The top scorer was inside-forward Wheldon with 25\u00a0League goals, a total which made him the Second Division's leading scorer, and the other four first-choice forwards all reached double figures.

Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, and the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies. Among the newcomers were back Fred Jones from Newton Heath, forward Harry Edwards, signed from Singer's of Coventry,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 124, 141. and centre-forward Frank Mobley, who joined soon after the start of the season, also from Singer's. They played in the same kit as in the previous season: royal blue shirts and stockings with white knickerbockers.", "Small Heath opened their first season in the Football League at home to Burslem Port Vale. The match was due to kick off at 3:30\u00a0pm, but the visitors arrived half an hour late. Small Heath won the toss and, with the dual benefit of a strong wind behind them and their opponents having only ten men because their centre-forward Billy Beats had missed his train, had most of the play in the first half. After a near-miss by Tommy Hands, their first goal came as \"the right wing took the ball in front of goal, and after a little scrimmaging it was sent between the posts\"; the goal was credited to Fred Wheldon. Port Vale rallied, and the game, \"more vigorous than scientific\", was even until Small Heath scored twice just before half-time. In the second half, with the advantage of the wind, Port Vale pulled a goal back, but the final score was 5\u20131.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 10.", "Small Heath went through the season unbeaten at Coventry Road. In the League, they scored 90 goals, at a rate of more than 4 goals per game, and all five first-choice forwards reached double figures. The leading scorer was Fred Wheldon, with 25 goals from the 22 League fixtures and 1 in the test match, a total which made him the top scorer for the Second Division.

After a dull and goalless first half, Tommy Hands crossed the ball for Wheldon to open the scoring, from which point goals followed regularly until the match finished as a 4\u20133 home win. Wheldon was involved in two of his side's three goals, but was \"too closely watched by Reynolds to be as effective as usual\". On a day when the hard and slippery surface meant \"those teams whose players have the least regard for the safety of their limbs usually gain the victory\", Small Heath, without Hallam, who was unwell, and William Reynolds, injured against Aston Villa, defeated a \"very indifferent\" Northwich Victoria 7\u20130. In their next match, at Crewe Alexandra, the home players reportedly played \"with supreme indifference to the safety of their opponents' limbs\". Hands, who had been one of Small Heath's better performers, was carried off after receiving a \"nasty kick\" to the leg, but despite having to play with ten men, the visitors won 5\u20133. Of Crewe's three goals, the first should have been disallowed for offside and the third was a Ted Devey own goal.", "The Leicester Chronicle felt that Darwen would have to \"play up\" to stand much chance against Small Heath, who had \"a smarter set of forwards than can be found amongst most of the first division teams\", and pointed out that Small Heath were the only team in either division to have scored 100 goals during the season. The players prepared for the test match at Droitwich Spa, where the saturated salt water of the Brine Baths provided relief for tired muscles. The match, played at Stoke's Victoria Ground, was an exciting one. Darwen had much the best of the first half, but failed to take their chances. Small Heath were restricted to rare attacks, but were dangerous on the break, and opened the scoring through Jack Hallam. Darwen equalised before the interval, and continued their dominance until superior fitness told. With six minutes left, Small Heath took the lead, the goal variously attributed to Wheldon or an Orr own goal, after which Darwen lost heart and Tommy Hands scored again four minutes later. The Daily Post suggested that \"one would scarcely believe that they were the same five forwards who have so often delighted the spectators with their play at Coventry Road\", but \"to every man [of the defence] great praise is due for so ably checking the opposing forwards\". The Nottinghamshire Guardian was less critical of the forwards, but took the view that Small Heath were fortunate to catch Darwen \"in a very crippled condition\", and that goalkeeper Chris Charsley had done the club a considerable service in making himself available for such a vital game.", "Small Heath went through the League season without drawing a match. They scored 103 goals, at a rate of 3.6\u00a0goals per game, and became the first team to exceed 100 goals in a Football League season (Sunderland scored exactly 100 the previous season). If test match goals are counted, all five first-choice forwards reached double figures for the second consecutive season. The leading scorer was Frank Mobley with 24 League goals, a total which also made him the top scorer in the Second Division, closely followed by Fred Wheldon with 22. Ted Devey, Tommy Hands, Billy Ollis and Wheldon were ever-present in the League, all but Devey for the second season running, and Caesar Jenkyns missed only the two games for which he was suspended."]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Small Heath's First Division campaign began on Saturday 1\u00a0September with a visit to local rivals and League champions Aston Villa, which turned out rather closer than predicted. Jack Hallam opened the scoring from a Tommy Hands cross with the first League goal of the season, \"for the match was started punctually, and it would have been a sheer impossibility to score faster than the Small Heath player did.\" Villa equalised some 20\u00a0minutes later, took the lead immediately afterwards, and retained that lead to the end. The Birmingham Daily Post picked out Hallam and Caesar Jenkyns for praise, was disappointed by Fred Wheldon, \"usually the bright particular star of the front rank\", and suggested that Jack Oliver would be a success \"when he has lost a little superfluous flesh\".", "Unusually, Small Heath led at half-time at home to Sheffield United. Charlie Letherbarrow, in only his second appearance for the club, scored after ten minutes and again approaching the interval to regain the lead. Between the two legitimate scores, he hit a swerving shot which looped up off the chest of goalkeeper William Foulke and into the net, but the referee judged that the ball had been played in from behind the goal-line. In the second half, Wheldon converted a penalty kick when Foulke pushed Hallam out of the way as he attempted to reach a cross from Tommy Hands, and Letherbarrow completed his hat-trick as Small Heath won 4\u20131. Jack Oliver received a good reception when he returned to his former club\u00a0\u2013 Small Heath were introduced as \"Oliver's team\"\u00a0\u2013 but Sunderland took no pity, winning 7\u20131. At Liverpool, an exciting game produced a 3\u20131 defeat. The three home forwards worked as one, putting extra pressure on the centre of the visiting midfield, and the defence was unable to hold them out. The game was rough at times, Liverpool's Joe McQue attracting particular attention because of an incident in the corresponding match the previous season when Caesar Jenkyns was sent off for his violent reaction to McQue kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen.", "Joe Fountain made his debut against Sunderland as a late replacement for Wheldon, whose sister had died on the morning of the match. On a slippery pitch \"thickly strewn with chaff and hayseeds\", Small Heath fell a goal behind in a first half dominated by the defences of both teams. The special training undertaken by the home side in preparation for the match took effect, as \"in the closing stages they looked winners all over\", and Sunderland had goalkeeper Ned Doig to thank for restricting the scoring to just Tommy Hands' equaliser. The attendance of 15,000 was nearly double the highest recorded in previous seasons.Matthews (1995), Complete Record, pp. 140\u201342.", "The players went to Malvern for special training before the home game with Burnley. Joe Fountain was an \"excellent\" stand-in for the injured Tommy Hands at outside left and Jenkyns was \"a tower of strength\" as Wheldon scored the only goal of a scrappy game to bring Small Heath's points total to 22 with three matches left. The Daily Post predicted that 24 would be enough to avoid the test matches. On Easter Monday, Hands returned to the team for the last home League match of the season, a goalless draw with Sheffield Wednesday in which both teams had numerous chances to score."]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["With Joe Fall still unavailable because of an injury sustained in pre-season training, Charles Partridge was replaced in goal by reserve Jim Roach, who made an eventful debut at local rivals Aston Villa. According to the Birmingham Daily Post, he should take no blame for any of the five goals conceded before half-time, due in part to the sun in his eyes and with the half-backs \"little more than landmarks on the field\". On change of ends, the balance of play tilted towards the visitors, but the match still finished 7\u20133. Fall returned to fitness for Small Heath's third defeat of the season, at home to Stoke in a game characterised by excessive foul play. At Nottingham Forest, Tommy Hands and Jack Hallam were lively on the wings, but the weakness of the half-back line was noted in yet another loss.", "\"There was only one team in it at Coventry-road on Saturday, and that team was not the Heathens.\" So said the Sheffield Independent as Derby County won 3\u20131 to return to the top of the table. In the next week, Small Heath were eliminated in the first round of two local cup competitions. Tommy Hands scored and Billy Ollis was carried off injured as they lost 2\u20131 to West Bromwich Albion in the first round of the Staffordshire Senior Cup, a competition they had entered for the first time, and in the Birmingham Cup, they lost by the same score at Sheffield Wednesday in a game marked by poor forward play by both sides. The programme for January finished with home and away matches against Wolverhampton Wanderers. At home, Hands and Mobley were left out. Adlington, who had scored in four successive matches, Bruce and Ollis scored before the interval, but the second half was one-sided in the opposite direction. Wanderers came back to 3\u20132, \"shots innumerable were sent in\", but Small Heath held on for their fifth win of the season. At Wolverhampton, Wheldon opened the scoring for the visitors much against the run of play, but thereafter Wanderers scored at will to make the final score 7\u20132.", "Small Heath dominated the play against Sheffield United, but visiting goalkeeper William Foulke was on fine form, and his team had a one-goal lead at the interval. Mobley scored twice in the second half, and both were in controversial circumstances. After a United defender won the ball from Tommy Hands, Hands kicked out at him; the referee turned to have a quick word with Hands, meanwhile the ball fell to Mobley, standing in an offside position, who put it in the net, and the referee, who had not seen Mobley's offside, awarded the goal. Encouraged by this stroke of luck, Small Heath pressed, and from a Leake cross, Wheldon executed an overhead kick from which the ball rebounded off the crossbar to Mobley, again standing offside, who tapped it in for the winning goal. The victory left them needing only a draw from the final match of the season, at home to Sunderland, to avoid the test matches. In the event, they were outclassed. Though as usual the defence was satisfactory, the forwards' positioning was poor, Hallam and Walton were sadly missed, and they lacked anyone of influence to organise them. A 1\u20130 defeat, combined with Wolverhampton's 5\u20130 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers, confirmed Small Heath's participation in the test matches.", "|style=background:#fcc|L||1\u20132||style=text-align:left|Tommy Hands"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["George Hollis's goalkeeping came in for praise as Small Heath began their season in a howling gale, despite Aston Villa beating their visitors 5\u20131 in a friendly match.

Small Heath took an early lead through a combination of Frederick Wilkes and Hallam, but Burton, showing more skill than the home forwards, equalised in the first half. After the interval, Hallam scored after Wilkes' shot was parried, then Wilkes himself made the final score 3\u20131.The Alliance. Small Heath v. Burton. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 7 September 1891.

The Post heaped particular praise on the half-back line, Ollis, Jenkyns and Ted Devey, who \"worked wonders, for they not only checkmated their opponents, but fed their own forwards very judiciously, and were always ready to assist in the defence when the necessity arose.\"Notes on Sport.
