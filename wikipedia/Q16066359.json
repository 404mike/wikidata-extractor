His defeat of Jack Carter in 1819 earned him some notoriety, and he toured the country giving exhibition matches with the reigning English heavyweight champion Tom Cribb.  Cribb on his retirement in 1821 handed over the championship title to Spring.  To defend the title Spring offered to fight anyone in England.  No one challenged him until 1823, when he fought Bill Neat.  Neat referred to Spring as a \"lady\u2019s maid fighter\"  because of his weak punch.  The fight lasted just 37 minutes, with Spring victorious after knocking Neat down in the first round and cutting him severely in the second.  This victory ensured that Spring was officially recognized as the heavyweight champion of England.Heavyweight Champions of England"]}, {"page": "John Thurtell", "response": ["Thurtell achieved fame as a boxing promoter.
