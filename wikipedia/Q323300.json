In 1973, Taylor was appointed curator of the orchid division of the herbarium and, according to Kew, \"under his direction, orchid taxonomy was revitalised and its horticultural contacts strengthened.\"One of Taylor's main botanical focuses was the genus Utricularia. He authored many species in the genus and provided the most comprehensive monograph on the genus in 1986 and revised in 1989  as The genus Utricularia - a taxonomic monograph.
