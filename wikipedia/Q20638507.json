Goalkeeper Gordon Livsey remembered Dougan as a great motivator, but tactically limited. Dougan negotiated a four figure shirt sponsorship with Kettering Tyres, which was the first such deal in England. After its use in the Southern League Premier Division match against Bath City on 24 January 1976 the FA demanded that the club remove the sponsor's logo threatening a fine of \u00a31000, and were not impressed when Dougan initially attempted to circumvent the FA's demands by shortening the branding 'Kettering Tyres' to simply 'Kettering T'.James Ferguson: \"Defining Moment: Kettering Town puts a logo on its football shirts, January 1976\", Financial Times, 27 February 2020 The logo was removed, though in June 1977 the FA decreed that a 2.5 square inch logo would be permitted in the future provided it was not \"detrimental to the image of the game\". He led the \"Poppies\" to a third-place league finish and the Third Round of the FA Cup in 1976\u201377. He helped to improve the career prospects of many of his players, particularly Billy Kellock, who went on to play over 250 games in the Football League after leaving Kettering in 1979. Dougan left the club after chairman John Nash resigned in June 1977."]}, {"page": "Brian Thompson (footballer born 1950)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Thompson (footballer, born 1950)"]}, {"page": "Brian Thompson (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["Brian Thompson (1938\u20132011) was an English goalkeeper, who played for Grantham Town, Loughborough and Peterborough United."]}]}}
