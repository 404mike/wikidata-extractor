He remained in that position for the rest of his life, also serving concurrently as organist at a variety of other smaller churches. From 1867 until his death 9 years later he was the organist at the Chapel Royal, St. James's. His students included Canadian organist Romain-Octave Pelletier I; English organists Edmund Chipp, Langdon Colborne, and Henry Willis; and English conductor Henry Wood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Wood", "response": ["Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument.Wood, p. 17 and Jacobs, p. 6 Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.  In June 1883, visiting the International Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months.Jacobs, p. 10 At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter."]}, {"page": "1876 in music", "response": ["* \"Rose of Killarney\" by George Cooper & John Rogers Thomas"]}, {"page": "John Stainer", "response": ["In 1849, after a year's probation, young Stainer became a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an accomplished player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch and a fine treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 he was invited to sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school.Dibble, pps. 11\u201312. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. At this time he might have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years. Certainly the two young men later became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays.Dibble, p. 34. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of \u00a330 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.Dibble, p. 36."]}, {"page": "St Sepulchre-without-Newgate", "response": ["*George Cooper 1784\u20131799", "*George Cooper 1799\u20131843 (son of above)", "*George Cooper 1843\u20131876 (son of above)"]}, {"page": "Henry Willis", "response": ["Willis was born in London, the son of a North London builder, and with George Cooper, later sub-organist of St Paul's Cathedral, he learned to play the organ with some help from Thomas Attwood, St Paul's organist.
