A recurrent subject in his books and papers is the volatility smile, and he published in 2006 a book The Volatility Surface based on a course he taught for six years at New York University, along with Nassim Taleb.  More recently his work has moved in the direction of market microstructure, especially as applied to algorithmic trading. He is the author of The Volatility Surface: A Practitioner's Guide. (2006, New Jersey: Wiley. ISBN 0471792519)\nIn March 2010, Jim Gatheral left his position at Merrill Lynch to assume a tenured full professor position at the Financial Engineering Masters Program at Baruch College, where he is teaching volatility surface modeling and market microstructure. Prior to this, he worked at Bank of America and Bankers Trust before heading the Equity Quantitative Analytics group at Merrill Lynch in 1996, where he was a managing director for 17 years.  In 1998 he became a fellow of the Masters Program of Mathematics in Finance at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University, where he was an adjunct professor for 12 years.\nIn April 2013, Jim Gatheral was named Presidential Professor at Baruch College. In February 2021, together with Professor Mathieu Rosenbaum of \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Jim Gatheral was named 2021 Quant of the Year by Risk.net.He received his PhD in theoretical physics from Cambridge University (1983), and a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy from the University of Glasgow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fokker\u2013Planck equation", "response": ["In mathematical finance for volatility smile modeling of options via local volatility, one has the problem of deriving a diffusion coefficient {\\sigma}(\\mathbf{X}_t,t) consistent with a probability density obtained from market option quotes. The problem is therefore an inversion of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation: Given the density f(x,t) of the option underlying X deduced from the option market, one aims at finding the local volatility {\\sigma}(\\mathbf{X}_t,t) consistent with f. This is an inverse problem that has been solved in general by Dupire (1994, 1997) with a non-parametric solution.Bruno Dupire (1994) Pricing with a Smile.
