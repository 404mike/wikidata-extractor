He managed both of the Edinburgh derby rivals, Heart of Midlothian (Hearts) and Hibernian (Hibs).\nThe Sunday Herald newspaper listed McCartney in 22nd place in their 2003 list of the 50 greatest Scottish football managers, citing his role in the development of Hibs' Famous Five forward line. The newspaper also said that McCartney \"was intelligent, jovial and had great presence\", and described his ultimate failure to win a major trophy as \"unthinkably cruel\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["In the first season of competitive football after the Second World War, Hibs reached the 1947 Scottish Cup Final. They took an early lead in the match, but went on to lose 2\u20131 to Aberdeen. With Reilly added to the first team in 1947\u201348, Hibs won the Scottish league championship for the first time since 1903. This was achieved despite the death of team manager Willie McCartney in January 1948. McCartney was succeeded by Hugh Shaw, who added Johnstone to the first team during 1948. Hibs finished third in the league in 1948\u201349. In a friendly match against Nithsdale Wanderers on 21 April 1949, Hibs included all of the famous five players in the same team for the first time. They then made their collective competitive debut on 15 October 1949, in a 2\u20130 win against Queen of the South. They improved on their season from the year before, by finishing second in the league to Rangers by one point.", "From 1875 until 1903, Hibs were managed by a committee, although Dan McMichael, who also acted as treasurer, secretary and physiotherapist, was effectively the manager when the club won the 1902 Scottish Cup and the 1903 league championship. Willie McCartney took charge of part of the league-winning 1947\u201348 season, but he collapsed and died after a Scottish Cup match in January 1948. Hugh Shaw inherited that team, and went on to win three league championships in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Alan Stubbs won the Scottish Cup in 2015\u201316, ending a 114-year drought in that competition. Eddie Turnbull, Alex Miller and John Collins all won one Scottish League Cup each. Bobby Templeton, Bertie Auld, Alex McLeish and Neil Lennon all won second tier championships."]}, {"page": "Heart of Midlothian F.C.", "response": ["* Willie McCartney (1919\u20131935)"]}, {"page": "McCartney (surname)", "response": ["* Willie McCartney (died 1948), Scottish football manager"]}]}}
