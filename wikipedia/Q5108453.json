Some reviewers, such as Nick Kent of NME, felt that Seventeen Seconds represented a far more mature Cure, who had come very far musically in less than one year. Ian Cranna of Smash Hits wrote that the band were creating more ambitious music, while still retaining their \"powerful melodic intensity\". Chris Westwood of Record Mirror was less enthusiastic, viewing the album as \"a sidewards step\" rather than a progression; he found the material \"biteless, a bit distant\", showcasing a \"reclusive, disturbed Cure, sitting in cold, dark, empty rooms, watching clocks\"."]}, {"page": "Lionheart (Kate Bush album)", "response": ["Reception to the album was average, with the album almost universally being looked upon as an inferior version of her debut. NME's Ian Penman wrote: \"'Mature' lyrics sung in that twee irritating schoolgirl-siren voice [...] Actually most of the time she's nearer a vague British lineage \u2013 Barbara Dickson to Lynsey de Paul \u2013 than a Joni/Janis wonderland\". Record Mirror was not convinced and wrote about the performance between the musicians: \"The feel is often bland and soulless\". Reviewer Chris Westwood concluded: \"A product which is at best moderate, lacking and often severely irritating... This is flat conceived silliness.\" The American magazine Trouser Press rated it well, in particular the songs \"Symphony in Blue\", \"In the Warm Room\" and \"Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake\"."]}, {"page": "Live at the Witch Trials", "response": ["Live at the Witch Trials was met with a very positive reception from critics upon its release. Record Mirrors Chris Westwood described the album as \"a rugged, concerned, attuned, rebellious jukebox\", while Sounds reviewer Dave McCullough called it \"an album of staggeringly rich, mature music, inner questioning hand in hand with rock and roll at its fiercest, its finest, its most honest, rock and roll at its naked, most stimulating prime.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said he initially found it \"too tuneless and crude\", but later \"played it in tandem with Public Image Ltd. one night and for a few bars could hardly tell the difference\", concluding that \"in this icky pop moment we could use some ugly rebellion.\" Allan Jones of Melody Maker was less impressed, being especially negative about the group's then-rhythm section of Marc Riley and Karl Burns."]}, {"page": "Record Mirror", "response": ["*Chris Westwood"]}, {"page": "Grotesque (After the Gramme)", "response": ["In contemporary reviews, Johnny Waller, reviewing Grotesque for Sounds, hailed the album as \"rock n' roll with a conscience\". Critic Robert Christgau described it simply as \"poetry readings with two-chord backing\". NME writer Graham Lock was more reserved in his praise, deeming it the Fall's \"least flawed album\" while suggesting that the band had yet to reach their full potential. Chris Westwood of Record Mirror viewed it as a disappointment, finding that the band's cynical outlook had become predictable."]}, {"page": "The Scream (album)", "response": ["The Scream was named \"the best debut album of the year\" by Sounds. Reviewer Peter Silverton gave the album 5 stars out of 5, and the paper listed it at No. 2 in its end-of-year best album list. Record Mirror also published a 5-star review, saying: The Scream \"points to the future, real music for the new age. [...] It is vital, it's moving. It's a ... landmark.\" Chris Westwood praised the cohesion between the words and the music: \"The album's lyrical frame of mind is perfectly reflected in the work of [guitarist] McKay. [Bassist] Severin and [drummer] Morris; constantly shifting, restless, controlled aggression, they are as essential as Siouxsie.\" Melody Maker described the sound as \"strong, abrasive, visceral and constantly inventive, with a thrust that makes the spaces equal partners to the notes\", with the critic comparing the album's textures to that of Wire and Pere Ubu. ZigZag qualified it as a \"magnificent record\", with reviewer Kris Needs writing: \"I can't think of another group who could have made an LP so uncompromising, powerful and disturbing, yet so captivating and enjoyable [...] It is certainly a special classic to join milestones like [David Bowie's] Diamond Dogs, Roxy [Music]'s first and [Lou Reed's] Berlin. This is music of such strength and vision that you just can't not be moved by the time they swing into the final climactic passage of 'Switch', the closing track.\" Needs qualified the sound as \"huge, sometimes awe-inspiring\" and commented that drummer Morris created \"one of the best drum sounds I've ever heard \u2013 the deep echo and floor-shuddering mix accentuating his muted Glitter Band stomp\". Critic Adam Sweeting began his review by saying, \"This is a chilling, intense masterpiece\". Sweeting then noted that the musicians \"have perfected a group sound which is powerful but streamlined\", adding that \"the words and music combine to produce coolly dazzling images\".Adam Sweeting. \"The Scream - review\". 1979 - reproduced in Ray Stevenson's book: Siouxsie and the Banshees - Photo Book (1983).

Sounds critic Dave McCullough wrote that \"The Fall have never been stronger, the sound is more concise, more assured and Mark Smith's writing has an aura of confidence and direction to it.\" In his review for Record Mirror, Chris Westwood said that the album's \"clattering demo-tape production\" effectively draws attention to the songs' lyrics: \"Odd lines of vocal stick, and it's the odd lines that count.\" Dragnet was ranked the 35th best album of 1979 by NME."]}, {"page": "Julian Richards (director)", "response": ["In 1992, Richards moved to Los Angeles where he worked for Shapiro Glickenhaus Entertainment directing an EPK for Slaughter of the Innocents starring Scott Glenn and adapted Chris Westwood's novel Calling All Monsters for Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment at Universal Studios.

Readers of 12+ won't all agree with me and will find the suspense and horror of Calling All Monsters, A Light In The Black and Personal Effects chilling and compulsive. The writing is powerful and the plots original and well-sustained as the books rush to sometimes shocking endings - as in Calling All Monsters.", "For me Brother of Mine really demonstrates how much Chris Westwood has developed as a writer as he explores the relationship of twin brothers, trapped by their similarity and by their differences into a hatred of each other. When Tony meets Nick's girlfriend and allows her to believe he's his brother, the hatred grows and Nick looks for revenge. Alternate chapters tell the story from both points of view and at times, like Alex and Vicky, I found it hard not to confuse the two.
