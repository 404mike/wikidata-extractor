He played for Gainsborough Trinity and for Worksop Town before joining Darlington when the club re-formed after the First World War. By January 1920, Dickson was part of a Darlington half-back line\u00a0\u2013 the others being George Malcolm and Percy Sutcliffe\u00a0\u2013 who, according to the Daily Express ahead of their FA Cup tie with Second Division Birmingham, had acquired \"a reputation for upsetting opponents' designs\". In the event, they could not upset Birmingham's designs: Tommy Winship missed a penalty, and Darlington lost 4\u20130. Dickson and right-back Arthur Golightly were their most \"conspicuous\" players, though both \"perceptibly tired under pressure\" towards the end of the game. In February, he was one of two Darlington players selected for the North Eastern League representative team to face the Central League. He helped Darlington win the North Eastern League title in 1920\u201321, after which the club was elected to the Football League's newly formed Third Division Northern Section."]}, {"page": "List of Darlington F.C. players", "response": ["Other players took part in significant matches in the history of the club. On the opening day of the 1921\u201322 season, Tommy Winship crossed for Bill Hooper to score Darlington's first Football League goal, against Halifax Town; the goal came so quickly that the Northern Echo reported how Hooper could \"in all probability, lay claim to the honour of being the first player to score a goal in the Northern Section of the Third Division\". Hughie Dickson scored the second with a penalty kick to make the score 2\u20130, and George Malcolm, the club's first Football League captain, and Tommy Greaves also played in the match. Dan Cassidy scored the last-seconds winner to defeat Stockport County in the inaugural Northern Section Cup final in 1934. Dave Carr and Keith Morton scored two of the goals that earned Darlington a draw with Chelsea, League champions only three seasons earlier, in the fourth round of the 1958\u201359 FA Cup, and Carr scored again as Darlington won the replay 4\u20131 to progress to the last 16 of the competition for only the second time in their history. Ray Yeoman captained the team to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1965\u201366, and Ian Miller was captain and Paul Arnison, Liam Hatch and Sam Russell also played as Darlington won the 2011 FA Trophy Final."]}, {"page": "Tommy Winship", "response": ["Although Darlington performed rather less well in 1922\u201323 season, Winship remained in the thick of the action. Against Rochdale, he scored his side's only goal, struck the crossbar from distance, and was fouled for a penalty, but George Malcolm's kick was saved. The following week, he was again fouled for a penalty, and this time Hughie Dickson's kick produced the only goal of the game. In March 1923, after he scored twice against Bradford, the Derby Daily Telegraph described him as \"quite the most consistent forward in Darlington's weak attack\" whom \"no inducement has yet proved sufficient\" to persuade to leave. Arsenal had retained his registration, and listed him for transfer at a fee of \u00a3300, a not inconsiderable sum for a man of nearly 33."]}, {"page": "Percy Sutcliffe", "response": ["He returned to the Darlington side after the First World War to play his part in their second North-Eastern League title, in 1920\u201321, and subsequent election to the Football League in its newly formed Northern Section of the Third Division. He still retained the good opinions of his former employers: when Darlington hosted Norwich in the FA Cup in 1919, \"the visiting directors held a wholesome respect for Sutcliffe, whom they classed as a really good half-back.\" Ahead of the next round, against Second Division Birmingham, the Daily Express described the Darlington half-back line\u00a0\u2013 Sutcliffe, George Malcolm and Hughie Dickson\u00a0\u2013 as having acquired \"a reputation for upsetting opponents' designs\"."]}, {"page": "1915\u201316 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Brentford began the London Combination's Principle Tournament strongly, losing just one of the first 10 matches, but the departure of the locally based Football Battalion to the Western Front robbed the club of a source of quality guest players.

Middlesbrough proved to be a ready source of players, with former Brentford full back Joe Hisbent, half backs Henry Cook, George Malcolm and forward Harry Chapelhow also guesting.

He did not play for the first team until February 1925, in a goalless draw away to Bradford Park Avenue: George Malcolm switched to right back to cover for the absent Tommy Greaves and Harrison took over Malcolm's regular position at left half. That was his last appearance as Darlington went on to win the Northern Section title. He was retained for the coming season in the Second Division, and played for the reserves, but was not used at the higher level."]}]}}
