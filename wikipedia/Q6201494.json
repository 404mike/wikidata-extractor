He was a prolific goalscorer and scored the winning goals in both the finals of the 1951 Saint Mungo Cup and the 1953 Coronation Cup, as well as playing in the 1955 Scottish Cup Final for Celtic. He then moved to Leicester City in 1956, where he was twice the club's top scorer in 1958-59 and 1960\u201361. He also played as Leicester lost the 1961 FA Cup Final.

Yet their greatest accomplishment was in reaching the final of the FA Cup, with Banks conceding only five goals in their nine games en route to the final, and keeping three clean sheets in the semi-final and two replays against Sheffield United. Goals from Jimmy Walsh and Ken Leek finally broke the deadlock in the second replay at St Andrew's. Their opponents in the final at Wembley were Tottenham, who had already won the First Division title by an eight-point margin. Right-back Len Chalmers picked up a severe injury early in the match, and with Ken Leek dropped for disciplinary reasons in favour of rookie Hughie McIlmoyle, City were effectively playing with ten men and offered little threat going forward. Bobby Smith and Terry Dyson gave Spurs a 2\u20130 win and the first \"double\" of the 20th century, with Banks unable to prevent either goal."]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record for scoring 13 goals in 11 consecutive league games, in the 2015\u201316 Premier League season.
