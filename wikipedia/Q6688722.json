However, in late 1993, just as the wedding scenes were about to be recorded, Duprey suffered a breakdown and was sent home on leave. After it became apparent that she would not be well enough to return to the programme, a storywriters' conference was quickly convened and scripts redrafted. In the programme, viewers saw the engagement between the characters of Andy McDonald and Amy Nelson being hurriedly 'broken off' with another actress, Melanie Brown, being used in the final scenes to play the part of Nelson. Thereafter, Duprey withdrew from the limelight altogether, moving back to her native Liverpool, and became increasingly reclusive. In February 2000 she was found dead in a converted 1930s detached house in Mossley Hill near Liverpool University from a drug overdose. She left one daughter, Marcelle (b. 1976).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Amy Nelson || Louise Duprey || 1993 "]}, {"page": "Duprey", "response": ["*Louise Duprey (1957\u20132000), British character actress"]}]}}
