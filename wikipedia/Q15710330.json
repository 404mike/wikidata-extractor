At Oundle School, he developed an interest in Natural History and was given special access to the biology classrooms to study his finds. The Natural History Museum later asked him to mount an expedition to collect plant specimens from the Icelandic offshore island of Grimsey.He studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, London, but maintained his interest in Natural History, and had his first paper published in Nature in 1961. After qualifying in 1962, he became a research fellow in the department of social medicine at Birmingham University. In 1969, with a grant from the Medical Research Council, Barker moved with his family to Uganda, to research Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (\"Buruli ulcer\"), demonstrating that it was caused, not by mosquitos, but by wounds caused by the razor-sharp reeds growing near the River Nile.He returned to England and in 1979 was appointed professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Southampton medical school, and in 1984  director of the Medical Research Council Environmental Epidemiology Unit, now the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit. There he made the observations on the geographical relationship between neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and heart disease.  He won the GlaxoSmithKline Prize in 1994 for this work.\nBarker was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1998 and was appointed a CBE in 2006.He married twice; firstly to Angela, with whom he had three sons and two daughters, and secondly to Jan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1938 in science", "response": ["* June 29 \u2013 David Barker, English epidemiologist (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "1986 in science", "response": ["* English epidemiologist David Barker proposes his fetal origins hypothesis."]}, {"page": "Croonian Medal", "response": ["*2003 David Barker, Coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes: disorders of growth"]}, {"page": "David Barker", "response": ["David Barker may refer to:", "* David Barker Jr. (1797\u20131834), U.S. Representative from New Hampshire", "* David Barker (epidemiologist) (1938\u20132013), English physician and epidemiologist", "* David Barker (equestrian) (born 1935), British Olympic equestrian", "* David Barker (zoologist) (1922\u20132009), British zoologist and neurologist", "* David Barker (cricketer) (born 1951), English cricketer", "* David Barker Stevenson (1801\u20131859), Canadian businessman"]}, {"page": "Acheson Report", "response": ["* David Barker"]}, {"page": "List of Old Oundelians", "response": ["*David Barker, epidemiologist"]}, {"page": "GlaxoSmithKline Prize", "response": ["|1994 ||David Barker || \"in recognition of his singularly novel and important contributions to our understanding of the causes of a number of the major diseases of later life (cardiovascular disease, obstructive airways disease and diabetes) by demonstrating that their origins may lie in fetal nutrition and in growth in utero and during infancy\" || \u2014"]}, {"page": "Developmental Origins of Health and Disease", "response": ["The DOHaD approach originated in studies by David Barker and his colleagues, which showed a strong relationship between infant mortality rates from 1921 to 1925 and ischemic heart disease rates from 1968 to 1978. This led to the fetal origins hypothesis of the origins of adult diseases, which proposed that this relationship was caused by differences in early life nutrition. This in turn led to greater interest in the roles of developmental plasticity and early life environmental exposures in adult disease. The World Congress on Fetal Origins of Adult Disease held two meetings \u2013 one in 2001 and the other in 2003 \u2013 summarizing then-new research in these areas.
