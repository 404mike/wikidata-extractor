Katarina was the first companion to be killed in the series, appearing in only five episodes over two serials: The Myth Makers and The Daleks' Master Plan. The deletion of several scenes prior to recording meant that of the 93 lines originally scripted for her character only 78 made it into the final programmes with her character's final death scene being the first shots to be recorded. Due to the BBC's wiping policy in the 60s and 70s, only one episode to feature her still exists in the BBC archives (episode two of The Daleks' Master Plan; \"Day of Armageddon\").\nFollowing her appearance in Doctor Who, Hill acted in several small roles prior to moving to the Netherlands and subsequently to the United States. After returning to Britain she retrained to be a drama teacher and worked in London.She participated in the 1985 Children in Need programme along with other Doctor Who actors. Her last known acting role was a library assistant in an episode of City Life (a New Zealand soap opera), which was broadcast in February 1998 after her death.\nHer obituary was published in Doctor Who Magazine issue 261, which stated she died of cancer on 6 October 1997.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doctor Who Magazine", "response": ["*\"Interview: Adrienne Hill\" (Companion actor Katarina) "]}, {"page": "Katarina (Doctor Who)", "response": ["Katarina is a fictional character played by Adrienne Hill in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

Glover expressed excitement to work with Camfield, and to work with Russell again; he found Hill welcoming, but felt that Hartnell was not fond of him. When it appeared that Glover may not be available, Camfield interviewed Nicholas Courtney for the role, having known him at school in Egypt, but felt that he was not suitable. Marsh was cast as Joanna; she had previously worked with Hartnell in Will Any Gentleman...? (1953), during which she met her husband, Third Doctor actor Jon Pertwee. Adrienne Hill was also considered for the role, and read for Camfield and Lambert; they decided that she was not tall enough. Marsh recalled that she and Glover decided to act \"slightly too loving for a brother and sister\", which Lambert noticed and noted. The European actors in foreign roles were \"blacked up\" for the serial by the make-up department. Walter Randall was cast as El Akir, having been good friends with Camfield since working together on Gerry Halliday in 1951; Randall previously appeared in the series as Tonila in The Aztecs (1964).
