Safety across the border lies 400 miles away; in the meantime, they must make their way through alien territory, battling the climate and the terrain as well as the enemy's soldiers and helicopters. The Times called the book \"a fiercely masochistic accomplishment\" and concluded another review as follows:", ":: \"Barry England's prose has the tough, spare elegance of steel scaffolding. His vocabulary is wide, and used with arresting precision. The speed of the narrative is impeccably controlled - long slogs over country, moments of blind panic, passages of demoralizing inactivity, hair-raising evasions, all building up to a central set-piece in a burning field. On all levels, Figures in a Landscape is a brilliant achievement.\" -- Roger Baker in the Times, June 08, 1968"]}, {"page": "Michael Bradshaw", "response": ["In 1967 he began performing as part of the resident company at the Studio Arena Theater  in Buffalo, New York with actors such as John Schuck.
