He is currently the chairman and regional director of Special Olympics Northern Ireland. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours for his services to sport.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rule 21", "response": ["After the 1922 creation of the Irish Free State, Rule 21 continued to apply in Northern Ireland. Its strongest supporters were physical force republicans, and during the Troubles the GAA was suspected by many unionists of collusion with the Provisional IRA and other paramilitaries. While some advocates of Rule 21 were opposed to any engagement with  \"Crown forces\", others linked it to alleged targeting by the security forces of the GAA, in particular the occupation of part of Crossmaglen Rangers' grounds by a British Army base, which disrupted matches and other events there. One player affected by the ban was  Brian McCargo from Ardoyne, who played for Antrim county team before being obliged to quit in 1969 after joining the RUC Reserve, during a period after the abolition of the B Specials when some Catholic community leaders were encouraging Catholics to join the revised force. Sean McNulty from Warrenpoint won an All-Ireland minor medal in 1977 but joined the RUC in 1982. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland Department of Education made funding grants to GAA bodies while Rule 21 was in force, but at a lower level than would otherwise have been the case."]}, {"page": "2009 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Brian McCargo, Q.P.M.
