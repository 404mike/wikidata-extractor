They have said that improvements to the A9 in the 1970s stimulated the economy of Inverness: \"Without the improved access as a result of the A9 improvement, this would almost certainly not have been possible.\" The partnership believe that with comparable improvements to the A82, an additional income of \u00a376 million could be generated in the area. Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond stated whilst in office that the government is \"committed to improving the A82\", and he allocated \u00a3500,000 in June 2011 to study key areas where the route could be improved. Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown called the A82 a \"vital economic and social lifeline\"."]}]}}
