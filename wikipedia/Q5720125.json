Dagg had created the Sharpsichord, a solar powered cross between a harp and a barrel organ, which Bj\u00f6rk wanted to incorporate in one song. They are shown rehearsing \"Sacrifice\" and discussing the composition of the song. Attenborough states that our emotion comes from nature and that a composer has to be in contact with it. He then manages to compare the sound of Benjamin Britten's Sea interludes (which is playing in the background) to the sound of waves. The natural structure of music inspires Bj\u00f6rk who wants to bring nature in her composition. To discuss \"Crystalline\", Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough go to the crystal room of the museum. They talk about the mathematical basis of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, who explains the time signatures of the verses and the chorus of \"Crystalline\" and compares the composition of a crystal to that of a song. Scenes from the choir recording parts of \"Crystalline\" guided by Biophilia musical director Matt Robertson are shown. Attenborough thinks that the beauty of mathematics can be heard in composition like the \"Fugue 5\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Swinton tells how universe is made of patterns which are present in music but that we can't visualise, and how Bj\u00f6rk wants to change that. Because of that, the singer collaborates with Evan Grant, who works with cymatics. Grant explains how the Chladni plate works, and that he appreciates how Bj\u00f6rk tries to bring a real meaning in her music by taking a \"scientific and realistic approach\" to it. Grant tries to use cymatics on water for \"Crystalline\", which results can be seen in the music video for the song (directed by Michel Gondry)."]}, {"page": "Bj\u00f6rk: Biophilia Live", "response": ["The Biophilia Tour began on 27 June 2011 at the Manchester International Festival and spanned 3 years.  Several innovate instruments were created and utilized for the tour, including a musical Tesla coil, a midi-controlled gamelan-celesta hybrid, a pendulum harp and perhaps the concert's most unwieldy instrument, The Sharpsichord created by Henry Dagg in the UK.  Bj\u00f6rk chose a very specific format for the tour to show off all the instruments and create an intimate feeling: she and the musicians would be on a circular stage at the center of the venue and the audience would form all around them, free to move about and get a look at the various instruments placed throughout different parts of the stage."]}, {"page": "Orchestra of Samples", "response": ["Of the 200 and more musicians Addictive TV recorded for Orchestra of Samples, notable artists they collaborated with on the project include Dame Evelyn Glennie, Laetitia Sadier of British group Stereolab, Kuljit Bhamra MBE, Motorhead drummer Lucas Fox, Latin Grammy Award winner Mazinho Quevedo, Henry Dagg, BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician Shona Mooney, Senegalise hip-hop  artist Matador, French rappers Edgar Sekloka and Gael Faye aka Milk Coffee and Sugar and producer Chris Birkett."]}]}}
