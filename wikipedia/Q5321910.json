In the 19th century, the German philologist Johannes Vahlen was a key figure in the study of Ennius's Annales. Goldschmidt, however, argues that the British classicist Otto Skutsch's book The Annales of Ennius (1985) is the \"standard\" for anyone interested in examining the fragments of the poem. A later edition supervised by Enrico Flores sought to reconsider \"both the textual scholarship of the sources and the contextual placement of the fragments.\" In 1935, E. H. Warmington prepared a version of the Annales for the Loeb Classical Library; this version was later superseded by Sander M.
