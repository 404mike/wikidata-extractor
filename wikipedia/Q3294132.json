A goal by Sone Aluko handed Aberdeen their first home win of the season, and more importantly, all three points. The following week Aberdeen travelled to Dundee to face Dundee United for the second New Firm Derby of the season. It got off to another bad start for the Dons, Francisco Sandaza scored the opening goal in the opening 8 minutes, Northern-Irish striker Warren Feeney doubled the 'tangerine's' advantage on 14 minutes. Aberdeen pulled a goal back through Darren Mackie, but it proved to only be a consolation goal, as the Dons' lost the derby 2\u20131, although they had a goal disallowed for offside. The Dons' then hosted St Mirren in a midweek match at Pittodrie. Both the goals in the 2\u20130 win were scored in the last 10 minutes, First defender Andrew Considine finished well after good work by Mark Kerr then Englishman Sone Aluko was put clean-through on goal to score the second. The win propelled Aberdeen up to fourth in the league for the first time. Aberdeen then played Hibernian in their second trip to the capital. The Dons opened the scoring just before half-time when Darren Mackie pounced on Rob Jones' error to head the visitors in front, four minutes before half-time. Aberdeen doubled their lead eight minutes after the break when Sone Aluko flighted in a corner and Zander Diamond headed in his first goal of the season and put the Dons' 2\u20130 up. Three points turned into one point as Rob Jones made amends for his first half error and pulled one back for Hibs with a header in the 62nd minute, and with virtually the last kick of the game Steven Fletcher scrambled in a goal. Aberdeen then travelled to Glasgow to play Rangers at Ibrox. Aberdeen dominated the first half and it took a good save from Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor to prevent Derek Young from scoring the opening goal. The Dons' continued to hold the upper hand until Jean-Claude Darcheville bundled the ball over the line to put Rangers 1\u20130 up. Zander Diamond was unlucky not to level when his header was cleared off the line by Pedro Mendes. Seconds later Rangers had the ball in the net again, this time through Kris Boyd. The game finished 2\u20130 to Rangers. Aberdeen then hosted Motherwell at Pittodrie. Motherwell keeper Graeme Smith pulled off a fantastic save to prevent Darren Mackie from opening the scoring. However, on the hour mark, just seconds after coming on as a second-half substitute Gary McDonald headed the Dons' in front after fine work from Sone Aluko. It was 2\u20130 eight six minutes later, when Jeffrey de Visscher whipped in a cross, only for Darren Mackie to be hauled down by Motherwell defender Paul Quinn. Referee Chris Boyle showed a red card to Quinn for his last man challenge, and awarded a penalty to the Dons', which Lee Miller happily dispatched. The game finished 2\u20130 and moved the Dons' up to fifth in the table.", "| Mark Kerr", "|8. || ||align=left|Mark Kerr                         ||6 ||1 ||1 ||9", "|align=left| Mark Kerr"]}, {"page": "Scottish Football League monthly awards", "response": ["| Mark Kerr ", "| Mark Kerr ", "| Mark Kerr", "| Mark Kerr"]}]}}
