The club had been searching for an experienced goalkeeper following injuries to Mark Gayle and Mark Smith, leaving youth team player Steve Corry as the squad's only available goalkeeper. He had been recommended to manager Brian Talbot by coach Terry Westley who had signed Feuer during his time in charge of Luton in 1995. He made his debut for the non-league side in a match against Farnborough Town on 22 December 1998 before keeping a clean-sheet in his league debut four days later against Stevenage Borough. However, Feuer contracted a bout of flu during the match against Stevenage and was forced to miss the club's following match against Woking before returning to the starting line-up for an FA Cup tie against Premier League side Leeds United. Despite struggling to eat for two days prior to the match, Feuer decided to play and was credited with an impressive performance to keep a clean sheet and was named man of the match to help earn his side a replay, eventually losing 3\u20131 on 13 January 1999. He played seven matches in all competitions during his loan spell and the club made an attempt to sign Feuer on a permanent basis but were unable to afford the fee that the MLS wanted for his release."]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["A squad photograph taken prior to the club's FA Cup tie with Q.P.R. appeared in Match magazine.
