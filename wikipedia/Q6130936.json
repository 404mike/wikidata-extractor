He studied briefly at the Liverpool Academy and then moved on to the Royal Academy Schools in 1851.\nHis pictures focused on the details of lower-middle class and working class life in his native Liverpool, with works such as Waiting for Legal Advice (1857) which drew on his first hand experience as son of an insurance clerk. The Walker Art Gallery describes him as \"the most Dickensian of all the Pre-Raphaelites.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood", "response": ["* James Campbell (painter)"]}, {"page": "James Campbell", "response": ["James Campbell may refer to:", "* James Campbell (historian) (1935\u20132016), British academic specialising in Anglo-Saxon studies", "* James Campbell (industrialist) (1826\u20131900), Hawaii industrialist", "* James Campbell (Australian timber merchant) (1830\u20131904), Australian timber merchant", "* James Campbell (artist) (1828\u20131893), English artist ", "* Blind James Campbell (1906\u20131981), American blues singer and guitarist", "* James Campbell (clarinetist) (born 1949), Canadian/American clarinetist", "* James Campbell (author) (born 1951), Scottish writer", "* James Campbell (comedian), children's comedian in the UK", "* James Campbell (actor), English actor in Oh No It Isn't!", "* James Campbell, 1st Earl of Irvine, Lord Kintyre (1610\u20131645), colonel of the Garde \u00c9cossaise and son of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll", "* James Campbell (officer of arms), Lord Lyon King of Arms, 1658\u20131660", "* James Campbell (British Army officer, died 1745) (c. 1680\u20131745), Scottish officer of the British Army", "* James Campbell (British Army officer, died 1831) (1745\u20131831), British Army officer", "* James Campbell (land commissioner) (1787\u20131858), British Army officer and Commissioner of Crown Lands in Canterbury, New Zealand", "* James Campbell (Royal Marines officer) (1761\u20131840)", "* Sir James Campbell, 1st Baronet (1763\u20131819), British Army officer", "* James Campbell (New South Wales politician) (1820\u20131879), Member of the NSW Legislative Assembly 1864\u20131874 for Morpeth", "* James Campbell (Queensland politician) (1838\u20131925), Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "* James Campbell (Victorian politician) (1845\u20131893), Member of the Victorian Legislative Council (Wellington) 1882\u20131886, Assembly 1982\u201393", "* James Campbell (of Burnbank and Boquhan) (c. 1660\u2013c. 1713), MP for Ayr Burghs", "* Sir James Campbell, 2nd Baronet, of Ardkinglass (1666\u20131752), British MP for Argyllshire and Stirlingshire", "* James Campbell (1737\u20131805), Scottish MP for Stirling Burghs", "* James Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy (1851\u20131931), Irish Solicitor-General, Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor", "* James Campbell (governor) (c. 1773\u20131835), of British Ceylon, 1822\u20131824", "* James Campbell (postmaster general) (1812\u20131893), US postmaster general", "* James Campbell (Wisconsin politician) (1814\u20131883), member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "* James Campbell (English cricketer) (born 1988), English cricketer", "* James Campbell (English footballer) (fl. 1910/11), English goalkeeper (Huddersfield Town)", "* James Campbell (footballer, born 1869) (1869\u20131938), Scottish footballer (Kilmarnock FC and Scotland)", "* James Campbell (javelin thrower) (born 1988), Scottish javelin thrower", "* James Campbell (New Zealand cricketer) (fl. 1868/69), New Zealand cricketer", "* James Campbell (rugby union) (1858\u20131902), Canadian rugby player", "* James Campbell (pole vaulter) (1901\u20131975), British Olympic athlete", "* James Campbell (journalist) (fl. 2000s), Australian journalist", "* James Campbell, 2nd Baronet, of Aberuchil, see Campbell baronets", "* James Campbell, pseudonym of James Campbell Reddie (died 1878), author of pornography", "* James Campbell (potter), (died 2019) grandson of V.C.
