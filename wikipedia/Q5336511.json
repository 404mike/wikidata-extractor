Heather Phares described it as \"combin[ining] a wild variety of voices and textures, from impassively chilly to gorgeously lilting to gleefully offbeat.\" The first performers that left an impression on her were Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth and Kim Deal from the Pixies. Iggy Pop also inspired her for his \"energy - and he's a giver\". She stated that her biggest influences were Siouxsie Sioux, Grace Jones and Bj\u00f6rk.
