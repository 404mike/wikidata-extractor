He was a nephew of London music publisher Thomas East (ca. 1540\u20131608), although it was once \nthought that he was his son.In 1601, East wrote a madrigal that was accepted by Thomas Morley for publication in his collection The Triumphs of Oriana. In 1606, he received a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Cambridge and in 1609 he joined the choir of Ely Cathedral, initially as a lay clerk. By 1618 he was employed by Lichfield Cathedral, where he worked as a choirmaster, probably until 1644, when the Civil War brought an end to sung services. Elias Ashmole was a chorister at Lichfield, and later recalled that \"Mr Michael East \u2026 was my tutor for song and Mr Henry Hinde, organist of the Cathedral \u2026 taught me on the virginals and organ\".East's exact date of death is not known, but he died at Lichfield. His will was written on 7 January 1648 and proved on 9 May 1648. It mentions his wife Dorothy, daughter Mary Hamersly, and a son and grandson both named Michael.His most highly regarded works are his five-part fantasies for viols: Thurston Dart is quoted as saying, \"despite some slipshod part-writing, they are among the best five-part consorts of the time\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Byrd", "response": ["Byrd's last collection of English songs was Psalms, Songs and Sonnets, published in 1611 (when Byrd was over 70) and dedicated to Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, who later also received the dedication of Thomas Campion's First Book of Songs in about 1613. The layout of the set broadly follows the pattern of Byrd's 1589 set, being laid out in sections for three, four, five and six parts like its predecessor and embracing an even wider miscellany of styles (perhaps reflecting the influence of another Jacobean publication, Michael East's Third Set of Books (1610)). Byrd's set includes two consort fantasias (a4 and a6) as well as eleven English motets, most of them setting prose texts from the Bible. These include some of his most famous compositions, notably Praise our Lord, all ye Gentiles (a6), This day Christ was born (a6) and Have mercy upon me (a6), which employs alternating phrases with verse and full scoring and was circulated as a church anthem. There are more carols set in verse and burden form as in the 1589 set as well as lighter three- and four-part songs in Byrd's \"sonnets and pastorals\" style. Some items are, however, more tinged with madrigalian influence than their counterparts in the earlier set, making clear that the short-lived madrigal vogue of the 1590s had not completely passed Byrd by. Many of the songs follow, and develop further, types already established in the 1589 collection."]}, {"page": "St John's College, Oxford", "response": ["Choral services have been sung in the chapel since 1618.

The idea of this collection seems to have been taken from a book of madrigals by various composers, published at the Phalese press at Antwerp in the same year (or perhaps previously).see preface to Hawes's edition of The Triumphs of Oriana, pp.\u00a06, 8 The Antwerp collection had the general title of Il Trionfo di Dori, and consisted of twenty-nine madrigals each ending with the words \"Viva la bella Dori\". It is not unlikely that this collection may first have appeared in Italy, and become known to English musicians, or rather to Thomas Morley, through the agency of Nicholas Yonge, who, as we know from the preface to Musica Transalpina, was in the habit of receiving all the new music from Italy. If Hawkins's account of the circumstances under which the English collection was made in honour of Queen Elizabeth be true, the idea originated with the Earl of Nottingham, to whom the collection is dedicated, and who, with a view to alleviate the queen's concern for the execution of Essex, gave for a prize subject to the poets and musicians of the time the beauty and accomplishments of his royal mistress. Hawkins goes on to surmise that the queen was fond of the name Oriana, but at the same time adds, on Camden's authority, that a Spanish ambassador had libelled her by the name of Amadis Oriana, and for his insolence was put under a guard. This last circumstance would account for the fact, which seems to have been alike unknown to Hawkins and to Hawes, the editor of the reprint of the collection, that The Triumphs of Oriana was not actually published till after the queen's death in 1603. On this supposition the name which was intended to please the queen gave her great offence, so that the publication had to be delayed. This accounts for the presence of two madrigals, by Pilkington and Bateson respectively, in which the burden of the words runs \"In Heaven lives Oriana\", instead of the ending common to all the rest of the compositions, \"Long live fair Oriana\". The contribution of Michael East arrived too late to be inserted in any other place than immediately after the dedication, and Bateson's When Oriana walked to take the air was too late to be printed at all in the collection. It was placed in the first set of madrigals by this composer, which was published by East later on in 1603, together with Weelkes's second set, and Medulla Musicke by Byrd and Ferrabosco. The publications of 1604 are Michael East's first set of madrigals, &c., the First Book of Songs or Ayres of four parts, composed by Ff. P.

He based this conjecture on the presence of more than 70 full anthems in four and five parts, quite a large number.
