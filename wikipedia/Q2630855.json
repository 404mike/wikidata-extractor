Regulars on the club circuit, they had also recorded a privately pressed four-track EP. At the time, Noddy Holder was playing guitar and contributing to vocals in Steve Brett & the Mavericks. Signed to Columbia Records, the band released three singles in 1965.The Genesis of Slade compilation booklet After listening to American blues artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson II, John Lee Hooker and Howlin' Wolf, the Vendors decided on a change of direction and name: As the N Betweens they gained greater recognition and began to get supporting gigs with acts such as the Hollies, the Yardbirds, Georgie Fame and Spencer Davis.", "Chandler was not pleased with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image. The band adopted a skinhead look as an attempt to gain publicity from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend, but this also added an unwelcome association with football hooliganism. Noddy Holder and Don Powell were particularly tough-looking individuals already, and the skinhead look exacerbated the disturbing effect of having \"toughs\" in the band. In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of \"Shape of Things to Come\" which, despite a performance on United Kingdom music show Top of the Pops, failed to chart.", "After years of working with Lise Lyng Falkenberg, since 2006, Powell's biography Look Wot I Dun \u2013 My Life in Slade was released on 14 October 2013, by Omnibus Press (Music Sales Ltd).

Additionally the book featured contributions and quotes from interviews of 28 of Powell's friends, colleagues and family members. It looks in detail at Slade's long career and Powell's life, which included booze-ups with Ozzy Osbourne. To promote the book, Powell appeared at a number of Waterstones book signings, as well as a charity \"Tea with Don Powell\" event, a question and answer session, where Powell discussed his life with Clive Eakin of BBC Coventry & Warwick.
