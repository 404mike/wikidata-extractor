Examples are numerous: Bart\u00f3k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion (1937), Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire, Charles Ives's Quartertone Pieces for two pianos tuned a quartertone apart. Other composers used electronics and extended techniques to create new sonorities. An example is George Crumb's Black Angels, for electric string quartet (1970). The players not only bow their amplified instruments, they also beat on them with thimbles, pluck them with paper clips and play on the wrong side of the bridge or between the fingers and the nut. Still other composers have sought to explore the timbres created by including instruments which are not often associated with a typical orchestral ensemble. For example, Robert Davine explores the orchestral timbres of the accordion when it is included in a traditional wind trio in his Divertimento for accordion, flute, clarinet and bassoon. and Karlheinz Stockhausen wrote a Helicopter String Quartet.Irvine Arditti, \"Flight of Fantasy\", The Strad (March 2008):52\u201353, 55."]}, {"page": "Arditti Quartet", "response": ["The Arditti Quartet is a string quartet founded in 1974 and led by the British violinist Irvine Arditti. The quartet is a globally recognized promoter of  contemporary classical music  and has a reputation for having a very wide repertoire. They first became known taking into their repertoire technically challenging pieces. Over the years, there have been personnel changes but Irvine Arditti is still at the helm, leading the group. The repertoire of the group is mostly music from the last 50 years with a strong emphasis on living composers.  Their aim from the beginning has been to collaborate with composers during the rehearsal process. However, unlike some other groups, it is loyal to music of a  classical vein and avoids cross-genre music. The Quartet has performed in major concert halls and cultural festivals all over the world and has the longest discography of any group of its type. In 1999, it won the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize for lifetime achievement, being the first and only group to date to receive this award.", "The Quartet was founded in 1974 by Irvine Arditti with Levine Andrade, Lennox Mackenzie and John Senter while all were students at the Royal Academy of Music.  They modeled themselves on the La Salle Quartet of the United States, focused at first on the LaSalle repertoire, with the aim of supporting composers, playing the pieces as they want them played. Very soon the size of their repertoire went way beyond what the LaSalle achieved or in fact any other group in the history of classical music.", "Over more than four decades of its existence, the only founder member that remains is its leader Irvine Arditti.", "*Irvine Arditti (violin), 1974\u2013"]}, {"page": "Brian Ferneyhough", "response": ["*  Reviewed works: Brian Ferneyhough \u2013 Collected Writings, edited by James Boros and Richard Toop.

Violinist Irvine Arditti expressed an interest in the work and, by summer 1988, was able to perform Books I and II at a much faster tempo than anyone else, thus proving that the music was, in fact playable.Pritchett 1994a says \"even faster than the three-second-per-measure tempo given as a probable maximum in the score\", but Pritchett 1994b states on p. 265, \"In the score of the Freeman Etudes, Cage instructs the violinist to play 'as fast as virtuosity permits', and Arditti took that to mean 'as fast as possible', period.\" Arditti continued to practice the etudes, aiming at an even faster speed, and pointing out to Cage that the score indicated, that providing each Etude was at the same tempo, the speed could be further increased. The essence of the score indications about tempo are that one should play the most condensed and difficult sections \"as short a time-length as his virtuosity permits\", and play the rest at the same speed. Inspired by the fact that the music was playable, Cage decided to complete the cycle for Arditti which he finally did in 1990 with the help of James Pritchett, who assisted the composer in reconstructing the method used to compose the works (which was required, because Cage himself forgot the details after 10 years of not working on the piece). In Books III and IV Cage wrote much more complicated music than in the first half of the work and in fact forcing Arditti to slightly reduce the tempo of each Etude.,Pritchett 1994b, 265.
