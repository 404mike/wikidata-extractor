He was re-elected on 10 January 1835, on 5 July 1841, on 27 February 1847 (with his young brother-in-law the Marquess of Worcester), in 1852 again with Worcester.  When Worcester's father died in 1853, he became 8th Duke of Beaufort and was translated to the House of Lords.  His seat was then filled briefly by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, 8th Baronet between 9 January 1854 and 29 November 1854 when Hicks-Beach died.  A second by-election on 19 December 1854 resulted in the election of Robert Stayner Holford, a wealthy landowner and dilettante, as the second member. Codrington and Holford represented East Gloucestershire for the next ten years, until Codrington's own death.", "link_mentions": {}}}
