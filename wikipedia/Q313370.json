Another example is \"Talk Dirty\" by Jason Derulo featuring 2 Chainz, in which the radio edit omits three of the words present in the song: \"penis\", \"sex\" and \"pussy\". \"Penis\" is replaced with an elephant sound effect, \"sex\" is replaced by an echo of the word \"oral\" which precedes it in the standard album version from Tattoos and Talk Dirty, and \"pussy\" is replaced with a sound effect of a cat meowing. Occasionally, the song may be re-recorded with different lyrics, ranging from just the replacement of one line being re-recorded, like James Blunt's \"You're Beautiful,\" which replaces \"fucking high\" from the original version on his \"Back to Bedlam\" album with \"flying high\" in the second verse, to the entire song be completely changed, such as D12's \"Purple Hills\", which replaces profanity, drug references, and other inappropriate lyrics from the original \"Purple Pills\". Another example of the first type (one-line replacement) is The Black Eyed Peas song \"Let's Get It Started\", whose original title was \"Let's Get Retarded\" but was changed to make it suitable for radio play. Sean Kingston's \"Beautiful Girls\", in some radio edits, changed \"You got me suicidal\" to \"in denial\". The whole chorus of Cee Lo Green's \"Fuck You\" substituted the word \"Fuck\" with \"Forget\", thus changing the title to \"Forget You\" on the radio edit. In Bruno Mars' song \"That's What I Like\", as played on The Steve Harvey Morning Show, \"You and your ass invited\" is replaced by an instrumental version; the same occurs in the line, \"Sex by the fire at night\". In Fetty Wap's song Again, when played on SiriusXM The Heat, it was shortened down to 4:20.
