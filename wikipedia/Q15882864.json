Since then scores of new titles have been added, and the earliest translations have been revised several times. In recent years, this has included the removal of bowdlerization from earlier editions, which often reversed the gender of the subjects of romantic interest to disguise homosexual references or (in the case of early editions of Longus's Daphnis and Chloe) translated sexually explicit passages from the Ancient Greek into Latin, rather than English."]}, {"page": "List of Old Salopians", "response": ["* Thomas Ethelbert Page  (1850\u20131936), classicist"]}, {"page": "Thomas Page", "response": ["*Thomas Ethelbert Page (1850\u20131936), British classicist"]}, {"page": "1911 Cambridge University by-election", "response": ["* A third candidate appeared in the shape of Thomas Ethelbert Page, who also stood on a Conservative platform.
