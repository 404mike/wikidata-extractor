The economist William Stanley Jevons denounced it as a \"retrograde\" law. The famous novelist Charles Dickens used his magazine, All the Year Round, to attack the new tariff. On December 28, 1861 Dickens published a lengthy article, believed to be written by Henry Morley,Unlike the situation with Household Words, no ledger survives giving the authorship of each article in All the Year Round but Dickens scholar Ella Ann Oppenlander has attempted to provide a list in a work that is not easily procured, Dickens's All the Year Round: Descriptive Index and Contributor List (1984). The article that the above quote is from is widely regarded by scholars as a follow-up to an article from a week earlier, American Disunion. Graham Storey in The Letters of Charles Dickens attributes both articles to staff writer Henry Morley, based on a letter by Dickens stating that \"you say nothing of the book on the American Union in Morley's hands. I hope and trust his article will be ready for the next No. made up. There will not be the least objection to having American papers in it.\" He afterwards wrote, \"It is scarcely possible to make less of Mr. Spence's book, than Morley has done.\" Dickens micromanaged the magazine and so none dispute that Dickens must have generally endorsed the ideas in the articles."]}, {"page": "1856 in literature", "response": ["*Henry Morley \u2013 Cornelius Agrippa: The Life of Henry Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, Doctor and Knight, Commonly known as a Magician"]}, {"page": "William Farren", "response": ["In the types of characters he favored, \"crusty old bachelors, jealous old husbands, stormy fathers, worrying uncles, or ancient fops with ghastly pretensions to amiability\" (as Lewes described them), he was among the most highly regarded actors of his time. His performances were known for their polish and subtlety; in more sentimental roles, such as Old Parr, he was able to mix sentiment with cool irony. He was at home in Augustan and other eighteenth century roles, but he is not remembered as a Shakespearian actor. Macready remembered him as justly famous for \"studious correctness\", but described him as second to William Dowton and Joseph Munden in \"the rich quality of humor.\"Macready 130. William Hazlitt praised the conservatism of his style in the older plays. Leigh Hunt disagreed, disparaging Farren in favor of Dowton as Anthony Absolute (Sheridan's The Rivals). Even Hunt, though, acknowledged Farren's exceptional self-possession.Hunt 203. Writing in The Times in 1855, Henry Morley called Farren \"one of the most finished actors by whom the stage has been adorned in the present century.\" Writing after the actor's death, John Westland Marston recalls that the actor excelled in portraying \"the vanity, the self-love, the inconsistency, and now and then the redeeming good-feeling of worldly, well-bred people, and occasionally the credulous faith of simple, guileless people.\"Marston 160."]}, {"page": "Household Words", "response": ["Other contributors to Household Words  included James Payn, John Hollingshead, Harriet Martineau, Frances Shayle George and Henry Morley."]}, {"page": "Edward Arber", "response": ["Arber was born in London.
