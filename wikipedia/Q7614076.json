The goal, assembling a coherent album from all this stuff, probably seemed quixotic to many of the contributors as it was being made.\" In a 1991 interview with Melody Maker, Mark Hollis said \"the last thing I would ever want to do is intellectualise music because that's never been what it's about for me.
