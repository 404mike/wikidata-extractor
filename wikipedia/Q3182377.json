Robertson is best remembered for land reform and in particular the Robertson Land Acts of 1861, which sought to open up the selection of Crown land and break the monopoly of the squatters.\nRobertson was elected to Parliament in 1856 supporting manhood suffrage, secret ballot, electorates based on equal populations, abolition of state aid to religion, government non-denominational schools, free trade, and land reform. He saw free selection of crown land before survey as the key to social reform with poor settlers being able to occupy agricultural and pastoral land, even that occupied by lease-holding squatters. This insight enabled him to dominate the politics of 1856\u201361.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 15", "response": ["*1816 \u2013 John Robertson, English-Australian politician, 5th Premier of New South Wales (d. 1891)"]}, {"page": "Premier of New South Wales", "response": ["| John Robertson(1816\u20131891)", "| John Robertson(1816\u20131891)", "| John Robertson(1816\u20131891)", "| Sir John Robertson(1816\u20131891)", "| Sir John Robertson(1816\u20131891)"]}, {"page": "1891", "response": ["** Sir John Robertson, Australian politician, Premier of New South Wales (b. 1816)"]}, {"page": "Royal National Park", "response": ["It is the third oldest national park in the world after Bogd Khan Uul in Mongolia, established in 1783, and  Yellowstone in the US, established in 1872.

He was generally in favour of Sir John Robertson's land policy, of the extension of education, and of free trade. He was a strong supporter of free trade, immigration programmes and education reforms. He was also strongly in favour of developing manufactures as he was of encouraging agriculture. He introduced laws that gave the Government the power to employ teachers and create public schools, abolished government funding to religious schools and improved prisons."]}, {"page": "John Robertson", "response": ["*John Robertson (Bothwell MP) (1867\u20131926), MP for Bothwell, Lanarkshire 1919\u20131926", "*John Robertson (Berwick MP) (1898\u20131955), Labour Party MP 1945\u20131951 for Berwick and Haddington, then Berwick and East Lothian", "*John Robertson (Paisley MP) (1913\u20131987), Labour Party MP 1961\u20131979, co-founder of the Scottish Labour Party", "*John Robertson (Glasgow MP) (born 1952), former Labour Member of Parliament for Glasgow North West", "*John Robertson (premier) (1816\u20131891), fifth Premier of New South Wales", "*John Robertson (politician, born 1962), former Labor leader in New South Wales and opposition leader", "*John Robertson (Nova Scotia politician) (1784\u20131872), MP in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly", "*John Robertson (Canadian politician) (1799\u20131876), Scottish born member of the Canadian Senate from 1867", "*John Robertson (New Zealand politician, born 1875) (1875\u20131952), New Zealand Social Democratic & Labour politician", "*John Robertson (New Zealand politician, born 1951), mayor of Papakura District, New Zealand", "*John Robertson (congressman) (1787\u20131873), politician and lawyer from Virginia", "*John Robertson (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131937), Scottish footballer, who played for Bolton Wanderers, Rangers and Southampton", "*John Robertson (footballer, born 1953), Scottish footballer, who played for Nottingham Forest and Scotland", "*John Robertson (footballer, born 1964), Scottish footballer, who played for and managed Heart of Midlothian", "*John Robertson (footballer, born 1974), English footballer, who played for Wigan Athletic and Lincoln City", "*John Robertson (footballer, born 1976), Scottish footballer, who played for Ayr United", "*John Robertson (footballer, born 2001), Scottish footballer, who plays for St Johnstone", "*John Robertson (cricketer) (1809\u20131873), English cricketer", "*John Robertson (Olympic sailor) (1929\u20132020), Canadian sailor", "*John Robertson (Australian footballer) (1940\u20132001), Australian footballer, who played for Hawthorn", "*John Robertson (Paralympic sailor) (born 1972), British Paralympic sailor", "*John Robertson (American football) (born 1993), American football quarterback", "*John Robertson (composer) (born 1943), New Zealand born Canadian composer", "*John Robertson (comedian) (born 1985), comedian and host of Videogame Nation", "*John Robertson (mathematician) (1712\u20131776), English mathematician", "*John Robertson (physicist) (born 1950), English physicist", "*John Reid (British Army officer) (aka John Robertson, 1721\u20131807), British army general and founder of the chair of music at the University of Edinburgh", "*Private John Robertson (born c. 1780), U.S. soldier, participant in the Lewis and Clark Expedition", "*John Robertson (minister) (1768\u20131843), Minister of Cambuslang, Scotland", "*John Robertson (settler) (1797\u20131884), owner of a general store in Bells Corners (Ottawa, Canada) and Surveyor of Roads for the former City of Nepean", "*John Robertson (pastoralist) (1808\u20131880), Scottish-born pastoralist in Australia", "*John Robertson (Irish minister) (1868\u20131931), Irish Methodist", "*Sir John Robertson (ombudsman) (1925\u20132001), New Zealand Chief Ombudsman, 1986\u20131994", "*John Robertson (journalist) (1934\u20132014), hosted the interview portion of CBWT's 24Hours program in the late 1970s", "*John Robertson, Jr., House, a historic house in Barrington, Illinois"]}, {"page": "Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives", "response": ["|John Robertson"]}, {"page": "Charles Cowper", "response": ["In September 1857, the Parker Government was defeated and resigned, and Cowper became Premier again.

Cowper did well enough to remain Premier, but he did not have a reliable majority. His Government amended the Electoral Act to provide vote by secret ballot, universal manhood suffrage, representation primarily by population and more equal electoral districts. It also created 40 new municipalities, established district courts and prohibited grants to support public religious activity. At the June 1859 election, Cowper was returned for East Sydney. His government was beaten on a vote on his educational bill on 26 October 1859 and Cowper resigned from the Assembly the next day.

He opposed the first ministry of Henry Parkes on this issue and was loosely associated with the third ministry of John Robertson, but fell out with Robertson, denouncing his education bill as a sham and betrayal, returning to support Parkes. He lost his seat at the 1877 election due to his support for assisted immigration, which gave him a reputation as an \"enemy of labour\". Subsequently, a seamen's strike broke out against the Australian Steam Navigation Co, because it had begun to employ Chinese sailors on the Australian coast, and he was obliged as a director of the company to defend its policy, further reducing his popularity."]}, {"page": "Alexander Stuart (Australian politician)", "response": ["On 8 February 1876 Stuart succeeded William Forster as colonial treasurer in the third ministry led by Sir John Robertson, and held the position until Robertson was defeated in March 1877.

Stuart was returned for Illawarra at the general election in 1880 and became leader of the opposition. In 1882 the Parkes-Robertson ministry was defeated and Stuart became Premier from 5 January 1883 to 6 October 1885.
