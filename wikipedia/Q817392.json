He was ordained 1815 and moved to Kerala in 1816 where he founded a mission station in Kottayam,  and in 1821 he established a Malayalam printing press. He translated the Bible into Malayalam, in 1846 published the first English-Malayalam dictionary, and in 1849 published the first Malayalam-English dictionary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malayalam literature", "response": ["Contemporary Malayalam poetry deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism. Nineteenth century was not a very creative period for Malayalam literature (except towards the end) from the point of view of imaginative writing. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book Kerala Panineeyam written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE. But the foundations for the great renaissance that began at the end of the century were laid during this period. The establishment of colleges for imparting English education, the translation of the Bible and other religious works, the compilation of dictionaries and grammars, the formation of the text book committee, the growth of printing presses, the starting of newspapers and periodicals, the introduction of science and technology, the beginning of industrialization and the awakening of social and political consciousness: these constitute the giant strides towards modernisation. Like his predecessors Swathi Thirunal and Uthram Thirunal, Ayilyam Thirunal (1832\u20131880) and Visakham Thirunal (1837\u20131885) were great patrons of letters and were themselves talented writers. Christian missionaries Benjamin Bailey (1805\u20131871), Joseph Peet, Richard Collins and George Mathen (1819\u20131870) were responsible for many works on Malayalam language based on western models. Perhaps the most important of these missionaries was Herman Gundert (1814\u20131893). Born in Stuttgart in Germany and educated at T\u00fcbingen and Switzerland, Gundert came to India in 1836. He wrote over twenty books in Malayalam, the most important of which are A Malayalam-English Dictionary, A Grammar of Malayalam, Keralappazhama and Pazhamcholmala. The first authoritative grammar of Malayalam was also Gundert's contribution (1851). This led to the production of a number of grammatical works in Malayalam. Vaikkam Patchu Moothathu (1814\u20131883) published his Grammar of Malayalam in 1876, Kerala Kaumudi by Kovunni Nedungadi (1831\u20131889) came out in 1878. This was soon followed by the first history of the language by P. Govinda Pillai (1849\u20131897) published in 1881. The first work on rhetoric in Malayalam on the European model was brought out by Father Gerad under the title Alankara Sastram in the same year. By the end of the 19th century two different traditions could be clearly distinguished in Malayalam literature: the western school and the oriental or traditionalist school. Writers such as Kerala Varma Valiya Koyithampuran represent the confluence of these two major traditions. His major works include Mayurasandesam (Peacock Message) and the translations of Kalidasa's Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam (which got him the title of Kerala Kalidasa), and of Von Limburg Brower's Akbar. Meanwhile, many literary magazines were established to encourage all kinds of writers and writings, such as C. P. Achutha Menon's Vidyavinodini, Kandathil Varghese Mappillai's Bhashaposhini and Appan Thampuran's Rasikaranjini."]}, {"page": "Mar Thoma Syrian Church", "response": ["The word \"liturgy\" is derived from the Greek word leitourgia (leitos/loas: people +ergos: work) which means a service rendered to God and people. When the Bible was not available, the liturgy took the role of the Bible, much of the scripture is formed in the liturgical context. The original liturgical language used by the Malankara Church was Aramaic and Hebrew. The Bible that was in use also was in Hebrew.Church History of Eusebius (AD 260\u2013341) Book V, Chapter 10.) Later when Syriac replaced Aramaic in eastern countries, and the arrival of Knanaya people from Persia in AD 345, the Malankara Church began using Syriac. The Bible used in the Malankara Church is called the \"Peshitta\" and was in Estrangelo Syriac. This was the Bible that was in use till Malayalam (the language of Kerala) translation was available. The first printed Malayalam Bible, translated from Syriac was published in 1811 by Philipose Ramban with the provision of Claudius Buchanan, known as Ramban Bible it contained the four Gospels. (A copy of this Bible was later presented to Buchanan and is kept at Cambridge University Library.) By 1841, the whole Bible was translated, printed and released by missionary-scholar Benjamin Bailey with the help of Chandu Menon, a tahsildar in the Madras State service. Even though bishops from Syrian churches visited Kerala, they did not attempt to change the Bible into the newer forms of Syriac or to the native language. In June 1876, Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Pathrose IV visited Kerala and a majority of the Malankara Church accepted him as the head of their church. But those who did not join them continued to follow their own leaders and kept their peculiar identity garnered from reformation. After Mar Thoma Church had begun to use the liturgy in mother tongue Malayalam, other churches continued to follow the same for a deeper engagement with the laity. A revised version of the ancient and apostolic liturgy known as People's liturgy, the Liturgy of St James (Gal.1:18-19), was adopted in the church, later the liturgy has been translated into various languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. The Mar Thoma church follows the West Syrian liturgical tradition and is Eastern in the nature of its worship and ethos."]}, {"page": "CMS College Kottayam", "response": ["CMS College Kottayam was patronised by Col.

George Burg, an American-German missionary first introduced the Pentecostal experience in early 1900s. During those times, many evangelical low churches were from the Kerala Brethren and followed reformed puritan practises (Verubadh Sabha) and these churches was pioneered by K.V. Simon, Volbrecht Nagel, Anthony Norris Groves etc. The origins of the Indian Pentecostal Church can be traced back to K E Abraham, who belonged to the Kerala Brethren denomination during the period of the native revival movement in Travancore. Abraham was born on March I, 1899 to Jacobite parents in Mulakuzha, India. He converted to Pentecostalism at age seven in 1906, and was rebaptized on February 27, 1916 by Mahakavi K.V. Simon. During his younger years, Abraham ministered among the youth, and as a result, many people accepted Christianity. As a Christian minister, he had built a small place of worship adjacent to his house in Mulakuzha in 1920 for a Puritan Assembly."]}, {"page": "Kottayam", "response": ["In 1821, Benjamin Bailey, a British missionary, established C.M.S.
