They found that intellectuals could read Chinese texts easily, so they used Chinese Bibles at first. However, the proportion of intellectuals was only in the region of 2% and in order to spread their religion across the country more effectively, a Japanese Bible became necessary. Incidentally, a second reversion of Bettelheim's Luke was published in 1858, intercolumnated with the Chinese Delegates' version, and designed for missionary use in Japan. This version, with its heavy Ry\u016bky\u016ban flavor, proved just as unsuitable as Chinese-only Bibles. After leaving Asia and immigrating to the United States, Bettelheim continued work on his translations, and newly revised editions of Luke, John, and the Acts, now closer to Japanese than Ry\u016bky\u016ban, were published posthumously in Vienna in 1873-1874 with the assistance of August Pfizmaier."]}, {"page": "Gokoku-ji (Okinawa)", "response": [" is a Zazen Buddhist temple in Naha, Okinawa.
