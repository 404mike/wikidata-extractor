During the World War II he served in the RAF. After the war ended, he became an engineering inspector and active in the trade union movement. In 1967, he was elected to Sheffield City Council.\nAt a March 1973 by-election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Dundee East, holding off by 1,141 votes a strong challenge from Gordon Wilson of the Scottish National Party. The contest had been seen as three-way fight between Machine, Wilson and Lord Provost of Dundee, William Fitzgerald, standing as Conservative. On the day of the election it was speculated in The Glasgow Herald that the Labour vote may be hurt by the fact that Machin was an English candidate in a Scottish seat and because some local Labour supporters were angered as the felt Machin's trade union had used influence to \"buy\" his nomination. Signs that his English background was an issue were demonstrated during Machin's victory speech which was reportedly disrupted by 'angry shouts of Scottish Nationalist supporters', while police flanked him as he faced 'chants of \"Go back to Yorkshire\" and \"Go home, Englishman\"'.At the February 1974 general election, Wilson gained the seat by 2,966 votes, thus ending Machin's tenure as an MP of just 11 months. Machin attempted unsuccessfully to regain his seat at the subsequent October 1974 general election but then retired from politics afterwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*George Machin (Dundee East)"]}, {"page": "Labour Party of Scotland", "response": ["Unlike its Glaswegian counterpart, which exclusively contested elections to the Glasgow Corporation, Dundee's now larger party fought for a seat in the United Kingdom Parliament. The appointment of George Thomson as a European Commissioner in January 1973 saw him vacate his constituency of Dundee East, triggering a by-election two months later. The Labour Party of Scotland selected George MacLean to be its candidate, pitting him against Labour's George Machin, the SNP's Gordon Wilson and Conservative candidate William Fitzgerald, then Lord Provost of Dundee.  Nathaniel Gordon of the Liberal Party, equally optimistic, attracted Jeremy Thorpe to the city during his campaign.   In a closely fought contest, George Machin took the seat with a majority of 1,141, despite Labour's vote share declining by 15.6%. This was largely down to the strong performance of the SNP, who increased its own by 21.2%. The latter's campaign capitalised on keeping North Sea oil in Scotland to benefit people living in urban areas. A similar platform was used in the Glasgow Govan by-election later that year, successfully electing Margo MacDonald to the House of Commons."]}, {"page": "Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)", "response": ["Wilson was Executive Vice-Chairman in 1972\u20131973, and while Executive Vice-Chairman he had a responsibility for oil. Wilson stood as the SNP parliamentary candidate at the Dundee East by-election in March 1973, where he was narrowly defeated by Labour's George Machin. He did however clearly out-poll Lord Provost of Dundee, William Fitzgerald, standing as Conservative who was thought to have had a good chance of winning the seat. Machin was a native of Sheffield and some thought Labour made a mistake by selecting an Englishman for a Scottish seat. Anti-English feeling was reported to be shown during Machin's victory speech which was reportedly disrupted by 'angry shouts of Scottish Nationalist supporters', with 'chants of \"Go back to Yorkshire\" and \"Go home, Englishman\"'.
