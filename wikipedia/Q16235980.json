Stoke, having been relegated from the Premier League the previous season gave Rowett a large transfer budget. The players he brought in were goalkeeper Adam Federici, experienced centre back Ashley Williams, full-back Cuco Martina, midfielders Sam Clucas, Peter Etebo and Ryan Woods, wingers Tom Ince and James McClean and forward Benik Afobe. The team made a poor start to the campaign winning only two of their opening ten matches. Stoke won back-to-back games at the beginning of October against Bolton Wanderers and Norwich City before losing to Rowett's old club Birmingham. City then went ten games unbeaten through November and December but made little progress up the table as Stoke drew six of them, conceding late equalisers on three occasions. Stoke's run was ended by another defeat to Birmingham on Boxing Day. After poor results against Bolton Wanderers and Bristol City supporters began to call for Rowett's departure. Rowett's contract with Stoke was terminated by the club on 8 January 2019."]}, {"page": "Michael O'Neill (footballer)", "response": ["O'Neill was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Stoke City on 8 November 2019.
