He made his league debut four days later on 21 October during a 1\u20130 win over Lincoln City and his early performances saw him recognised as one of the most promising teenage defenders in Britain prompting interest from a handful of Premier League teams, even having offers rejected by Cardiff, and saw him handed his first cap for the Wales under-21 team during a 3\u20130 win over San Marino during the summer of 1996. He later went on to captain the team."]}, {"page": "1995 Welsh Cup Final", "response": ["|CB || ||  Lee Baddeley"]}]}}
