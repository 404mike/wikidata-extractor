However, his early passion had been classical music, and he would later gain extensive experience as an orchestral conductor in settings as variegated as musical theatre and rock recordings. He first met principal Air Supply members Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell while he was working with the orchestra in a production of Jesus Christ Superstar that included Hitchcock and Russell as cast members. He collaborated with many other musicians and songwriters throughout his career.He died of pneumonia in 1991. According to the website rememberme.org, Esler-Smith also had AIDS.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Air Supply", "response": ["In April 1979, the band released Life Support, a concept album which included a picture disc on its first printing. The album was recorded at Trafalgar Studios in Sydney. The album had a five-and-a-half-minute version of \"Lost in Love\", written by Graham Russell in 15 minutes; it was released as a single and peaked at No.\u00a013 in Australia and No.\u00a013 in New Zealand. The track caught the attention of Arista Records boss Clive Davis, who remixed the song and released it as a single in the US early the next year. In late November 1979 Russell was embroiled in a bitter court case with Samuel Nay over accusations of assault at a backstage meet and greet in Oklahoma. Nay later died during the court case and all charges were dropped. The line-up for the album kept Hitchcock, Russell, Cooper, and Moyse, and added Criston Barker (bass) and Frank Esler-Smith (keyboards/orchestra arrangements) with help from other session musicians. Esler-Smith had previously known Hitchcock and Russell from working with them in Jesus Christ Superstar.", "On 21 August 1989, using their old producer and welcoming the return of drummer Ralph Cooper, the duo decided to enter the studio again to record The Earth Is, which was released in 1991 by Giant Records under Warner Bros. Records. The recording contains their hit single \"Without You,\" along with singles for \"Stronger Than the Night\" (with a music video announcing that Air Supply was back) and \"Stop the Tears\" and the album sold more than one million copies. Inside the album is a note about Hitchcock and Russell's original Musical Director of their meeting place during  Jesus Christ Superstar (and long time Band Member/Orchestrator): \"This Album Is Dedicated to the Memory of Frank Esler-Smith.\"  Esler-Smith had died earlier that year (1991) from pneumonia."]}, {"page": "Lost in Love (Air Supply song)", "response": ["*Frank Esler-Smith - keyboard"]}, {"page": "Greatest Hits (1983 Air Supply album)", "response": ["* Frank Esler-Smith \u2013 keyboards, orchestrations"]}, {"page": "Making Love Out of Nothing at All", "response": ["In 1983, Air Supply performed the song on stage, in \"lip-sync\" form with full back-up band for the popular early 1980s television program Solid Gold.
