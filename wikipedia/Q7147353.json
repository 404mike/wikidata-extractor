This aspect of Gill's life was little known beyond his family and friends until the publication of the 1989 biography by Fiona MacCarthy. The 1966 biography by Robert Speaight mentioned none of it. Gill's daughter Petra Tegetmeier, who was alive at the time of the MacCarthy biography, described her father as having \"endless curiosity about sex\" and that \"we just took it for granted\", and told her friend Patrick Nuttgens she was unembarrassed. The children were educated at home and, according to  Tegetmeier, she was then unaware of how her father's behaviour would seem to others. Despite the acclaim the book received, and the widespread revulsion towards aspects of Gill's sexual life that followed publication, MacCarthy received some criticism for revealing Gill's incest in his daughter's lifetime.

The marshy land was drained, the winding lake which dominates the campus was built, and the area was landscaped. The original buildings were designed by architects Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Sir Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, with input also from the Vice-Chancellor Lord James, Professor Patrick Nuttgens and the Registrar John West-Taylor. The new structures were assembled using the CLASP system of prefabricated construction, hence York's inclusion among the so-called plate glass universities. The buildings are connected by numerous covered walkways and bridges. Most of the university's arts departments occupy premises in the college buildings, while many of the science departments have their own buildings."]}, {"page": "Heriot-Watt University", "response": ["*Patrick Nuttgens (1930\u20132004), academic and writer on architecture"]}, {"page": "Ratcliffe College", "response": ["* Patrick Nuttgens, noted architect, CBE"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh College of Art", "response": ["* Patrick Nuttgens (1930\u20132004), academic and writer on architecture"]}, {"page": "Robert Furneaux Jordan", "response": ["* Spirit of the Age - Eight Centuries of British Architecture (with Alec Clifton-Taylor, John Julius Norwich, Roy Strong, John Summerson, Mark Girouard, Patrick Nuttgens, Hugh Casson) (1976)"]}, {"page": "Sandy Nuttgens", "response": ["Nuttgens is the son of academic and architect Patrick Nuttgens and the grandson of stained glass artist Joseph Edward Nuttgens.

Because he had a German father, he was interned during the First World War and was asked to resign from his position as Head of the Stained Glass Department of the Royal College of Art in 1918, despite having an English mother and having lived in Britain since the age of three. He married Kathleen Mary Clarke in 1924 and they had five children; she died in 1937.
