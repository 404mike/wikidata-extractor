He led the Irish delegation at the negotiations that produced the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, and served as President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann from January 1922 until his death in August 1922.\nAfter a short spell in South Africa, Griffith founded and edited the Irish nationalist newspaper The United Irishman in 1899. In 1904, he wrote The Resurrection of Hungary: A Parallel for Ireland, which advocated the withdrawal of Irish members from the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the setting up of the institutions of government at home in Ireland, a policy that became known as Sinn F\u00e9in (ourselves). On 28 November 1905, he presented \"The Sinn F\u00e9in Policy\" at the first annual convention of his organisation, the National Council; the occasion is marked as the founding date of the Sinn F\u00e9in party. Griffith took over as president of Sinn F\u00e9in in 1911, but at that time the organisation was still small.\nGriffith was arrested following the Easter Rising of 1916, despite not having taken any part in it. On his release, he worked to build up Sinn F\u00e9in, which won a string of by-election victories. At the party's Ardfheis (annual convention) in October 1917, Sinn F\u00e9in became an unambiguously republican party, and Griffith resigned the presidency in favour of the 1916 leader \u00c9amon de Valera, becoming vice-president instead. Griffith was elected as an MP for East Cavan in a by-election in June 1918, and re-elected in the 1918 general election, when Sinn F\u00e9in won a huge electoral victory over the Irish Parliamentary Party and, refusing to take their seats at Westminster, set up their own constituent assembly, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.In the D\u00e1il, Griffith served as Minister for Home Affairs from 1919 to 1921, and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1921 to 1922. In September 1921, he was appointed chairman of the Irish delegation to negotiate a treaty with the British government. After months of negotiations, he and the other four delegates signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created the Irish Free State, but not as a republic. This led to a split in the D\u00e1il. After the Treaty was narrowly approved by the D\u00e1il, de Valera resigned as president and Griffith was elected in his place. The split led to the Irish Civil War. Griffith died suddenly in August 1922, two months after the outbreak of that war.", "link_mentions": {}}}
