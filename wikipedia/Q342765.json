He led the Irish delegation at the negotiations that produced the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, and served as the president of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann from January 1922 until his death in August 1922.\nAfter a short spell in South Africa, Griffith founded and edited the Irish nationalist newspaper The United Irishman in 1899. In 1904, he wrote The Resurrection of Hungary: A Parallel for Ireland, which advocated the withdrawal of Irish members from the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the setting up of the institutions of government at home in Ireland, a policy that became known as Sinn F\u00e9in (ourselves). On 28 November 1905, he presented \"The Sinn F\u00e9in Policy\" at the first annual convention of his organisation, the National Council; the occasion is marked as the founding date of the Sinn F\u00e9in party. Griffith took over as president of Sinn F\u00e9in in 1911, but at that time the organisation was still small.\nGriffith was arrested following the Easter Rising of 1916, despite not having taken any part in it. On his release, he worked to build up Sinn F\u00e9in, which won a string of by-election victories. At the party's Ardfheis (annual convention) in October 1917, Sinn F\u00e9in became an unambiguously republican party, and Griffith resigned the presidency in favour of the 1916 leader \u00c9amon de Valera, becoming vice-president instead. Griffith was elected as an MP for East Cavan in a by-election in June 1918, and re-elected in the 1918 general election, when Sinn F\u00e9in won a huge electoral victory over the Irish Parliamentary Party and, refusing to take their seats at Westminster, set up their own constituent assembly, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.In the D\u00e1il, Griffith served as Minister for Home Affairs from 1919 to 1921, and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1921 to 1922. In September 1921, he was appointed chairman of the Irish delegation to negotiate a treaty with the British government. After months of negotiations, he and the other four delegates signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created the Irish Free State, but not as a republic. This led to a split in the D\u00e1il. After the Treaty was narrowly approved by the D\u00e1il, de Valera resigned as president and Griffith was elected in his place. The split led to the Irish Civil War. Griffith died suddenly in August 1922, two months after the outbreak of that war.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 12", "response": ["*1922 \u2013 Arthur Griffith, Irish journalist and politician, 3rd President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (b. 1871)"]}, {"page": "Easter Rising", "response": ["After the death of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with parliamentary politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism.

De Valera resented Collins's clear power and influence, which he saw as coming more from the secretive IRB than from his position as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) and minister in the Aireacht. Brugha and de Valera both urged the IRA to undertake larger, more conventional military actions for the propaganda effect but were ignored by Collins and Mulcahy. Brugha at one stage proposed the assassination of the entire British cabinet. This was also discounted due to its presumed negative effect on British public opinion. Moreover, many members of the D\u00e1il, notably Arthur Griffith, did not approve of IRA violence and would have preferred a campaign of passive resistance to the British rule.

He said that he felt deeply betrayed when de Valera refused to stand by the agreement that the plenipotentiaries had negotiated with David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. De Valera, for his part, was furious that Collins and Arthur Griffith had signed the treaty without consulting him or the Irish cabinet as instructed.", "Meanwhile, under the leadership of Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, the pro-treaty Provisional Government set about establishing the Irish Free State, and organised the National Army \u2013 to replace the IRA \u2013 and a new police force. However, since it was envisaged that the new army would be built around the IRA, Anti-Treaty IRA units were allowed to take over British barracks and take their arms. In practice, this meant that by the summer of 1922, the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland controlled only Dublin and some other areas like County Longford where the IRA units supported the treaty. Fighting ultimately broke out when the Provisional Government tried to assert its authority over well-armed and intransigent Anti-Treaty IRA units around the country \u2013 particularly a hardline group in Dublin.", "Arthur Griffith was in favour of using force against these men immediately, but Michael Collins, who wanted at all costs to avoid civil war, left the Four Courts garrison alone until late June 1922.

However, although de Valera was in the area at the time, he is not thought to have ordered the assassination. Collins' death increased the bitterness of the Free State leadership towards the Republicans and probably contributed to the subsequent descent of the conflict into a cycle of atrocities and reprisals. Arthur Griffith, the Free State president, had also died of a brain haemorrhage ten days before, leaving the Free State government in the hands of W. T.

It cost the lives of many public figures, including Michael Collins, Cathal Brugha, Arthur Griffith and Liam Lynch.

Near the end of this year, Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith. In November 1901, Joyce had written an article,The Day of the Rabblement, criticizing the Irish Literary Theatre for its unwillingness to produce the works of playwrights like Henrik Ibsen, Leo Tolstoy, and Gerhart Hauptmann.

In contrast, the Republic's Ministry continued with Arthur Griffith as President of the Republic following de Valera's resignation.
