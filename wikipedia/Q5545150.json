A later painting, of the artist aged around 50, by Jonathan Richardson was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, a plate of this by Thomas Chambers was engraved for Walpole's Anecdotes. An 1849 edition of Walpole's book contained an engraving, by George Thomas Doo, of a self-portrait\u2014sitting in a library\u2014that shows him displaying a portrait of the Earl of Oxford; this was previously published in 1821 as a lithograph. Another self-portrait, with his wife on their wedding-day, was etched by William Humphrey. Richardson also drew the profile used in James Basire's plate in Nichols's Literary Anecdotes."]}, {"page": "William Etty", "response": ["The Combat was extremely well received, even by critics who had previously been hostile to Etty. In terms of composition and technique it was considered as equalling or even surpassing Titian and Veronese, and one critic considered it \"one of the finest and most masterly works that ever graced the walls of the Royal Academy\", while those critics who had previously dismissed Etty for his supposed obscenity reconsidered their opinions in light of it. The Combat continued to be one of Etty's best-regarded works, and formed the basis of a successful 1848 engraving by George Thomas Doo."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Hick", "response": ["A man of \"acknowledged taste and judgment\"; Hick's private collection built over a period of 30 years \"valuable, well known and much admired\", comprised works of the Italian, Flemish, Dutch and British Masters.

In 1856, Robinson was elected an \"associate engraver of the new class\", and in the following year missed election as a full member only by the casting vote of Sir Charles Eastlake, which was given to George Thomas Doo; on the retirement of the latter in 1867 he was elected a royal academician."]}, {"page": "George Doo", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Thomas Doo"]}, {"page": "George T.

In 1845, Etty took a smaller  copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation."]}]}}
