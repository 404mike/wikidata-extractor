Due to the continued absence of injured right back Danny Boxall, Dobson made his first start for the Bees in a 4\u20131 Football League Trophy first round victory over Oxford United on 5 December and thereafter became a regular starter in the team at full back on either flank. He starred in Brentford's run to the 2001 Football League Trophy Final and scored Brentford's goals in the 2\u20131 Southern Area Final first leg win over Southend United and opened the scoring versus Port Vale in the final at the Millennium Stadium, but the match ended in a 2\u20131 defeat for the Bees.
