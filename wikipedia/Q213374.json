Born to Irish parents in the Cowgate area of Edinburgh, Scotland, Connolly left school for working life at the age of 11, and became involved in socialist politics in the 1880s.\nAlthough mainly known for his position in Irish socialist and republican politics he also took a role in Scottish and American politics. He was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and founder of the Irish Socialist Republican Party. With James Larkin, he was centrally involved in the Dublin lock-out of 1913, as a result of which the two men formed the Irish Citizen Army (ICA) that year, they also founded the Irish Labour Party along with William O'Brien. Connolly was the long term right hand man to Larkin in the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) until taking over leadership of both the union and its military wing the ICA upon Larkin's departure for the United States, then leading both until his death.\nHe opposed British rule in Ireland, and was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916 commanding the Irish Citizen Army throughout. Following the defeat of the Easter Rising and the arrest of the majority of its leaders he was taken to Kilmainham Gaol and executed by firing squad for his part in its proceedings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 24", "response": ["*1916 \u2013 Easter Rising: Irish rebels, led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly, launch an uprising in Dublin against British rule and proclaim an Irish Republic."]}, {"page": "Easter Rising", "response": ["Organised by a seven-man Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days.Leaders and Men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916  Francis X.

The British Army brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels slowed the British advance and inflicted many casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland; Volunteer leader Eoin MacNeill had issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised.", "thumb|The signatories of the Proclamation: Tom Clarke, Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, \u00c9amonn Ceannt, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett", "James Connolly\u2014head of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA), a group of armed socialist trade union men and women\u2014was unaware of the IRB's plans, and threatened to start a rebellion on his own if other parties failed to act.

It went into coalition with Fine Gael, who also won a record number of seats. Labour was Ireland's third party or \"half-party\" up until the 2016 general election, when it suffered the worst general election defeat in its history, gaining just 7 seats.

Its anarchist wing, led by Armando Borghi, was firmly opposed to the war, deeming it incompatible with workers' internationalism and predicting that it would only serve elites and governments. Its opposition was met with government repression and Borghi and others were interned by the end of the war.Thorpe 2001, pg. 13\u201314 , Darlington 2006, pg. 995. The anti-war faction in the CGT, on the other hand, was a small minority. It was led by the likes of Pierre Monatte and Alphonse Merrheim. They would link up with anti-war socialists from around Europe at the 1915 Zimmerwald conference. They faced considerable difficulties putting up meaningful resistance against the war. The government called up militants to the Army, including Monatte. He considered refusing the order and being summarily executed, but decided this would be futile.Darlington 2006, pg. 992\u2013993. Syndicalist organizations in other countries nearly unanimously opposed the war.Darlington 2006, pg. 983\u2013984, Thorpe 2001, pg. 22. \"Let Germany win, let France win, it is all the same to the workers,\" Jos\u00e9 Negre of the CNT in neutral Spain declared. The CNT insisted that syndicalists could support neither side in an imperialist conflict.Darlington 2006, pg. 985, Thorpe 2011, pg. 10. A wave of pro-British sentiment swept Ireland during the war, although the ITGWU and the rest of the Irish labor movement opposed it, and half of the ITGWU's membership enlisted in the British military. The ITGWU had also been significantly weakened in 1913 in the Dublin Lockout. After Jim Larkin left Ireland in 1914, James Connolly took over leadership of the union. Because of the organization's weakness, Connolly allied it along with its paramilitary force, the Irish Citizen Army, with the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Together, they instigated the Easter Rising, seeking to weaken the British Empire and hoping that the insurrection would spread throughout Europe. The uprising was quickly quelled by the British army and Connolly was executed.Darlington 2006, pg. 987\u2013989. In Germany, the small FVdG opposed the socialists' Burgfrieden and Germany's involvement in the war, challenging the claim that the country was waging a defensive war. Its journals were suppressed and a number of its members were arrested.Thorpe 2001, pg. 6\u20137. The United States did not enter the war until the spring of 1917. The start of the war had induced an economic boom in the US, tightening the labor market and thereby strengthening workers' bargaining position. The IWW profited from this, more than doubling its membership between 1916 and 1917. At the same time, the Wobblies fervently denounced the war and mulled calling an anti-war general strike. Once America became a combatant, the IWW maintained its anti-war stance, while its bitter rival, the AFL, supported the war. It did not, however, launch an anti-war campaign, as it feared the government would crush it if it did and wanted to focus on its economic struggles. The IWW's practical opposition to the war was limited, 95% of eligible IWW members registered for the draft, and most of those drafted served.Dubofsky 1969, pg. 349\u2013355, 357, Darlington 2006, pg. 997\u2013999. Syndicalists in the Netherlands and Sweden, both neutral countries, criticized the truce socialists entered with their governments in order to shore up national defense.

Two-and-a-half years after the executions of sixteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist Sinn F\u00e9in party won the December 1918 general election in Ireland with 47% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 First D\u00e1il (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the threat of conscription for First World War service. The Irish War for Independence followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the Irish Free State, which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties.

It has been argued that his life was saved by four facts. First, he was one of the last to surrender and he was held in a different prison from other leaders, thus his execution was delayed by practicalities. Second, the US Consulate in Dublin made representations before his trial (i.e., was he actually a United States citizen and if so, how would the United States react to the execution of one of its citizens?) while the full legal situation was clarified. The UK was trying to bring the US into the war in Europe at the time, and the Irish American vote was important in US politics. Third, when Lt-Gen Sir John Maxwell reviewed his case he said, \"Who is he? I haven't heard of him before. I wonder would he be likely to make trouble in the future?\" On being told that de Valera was unimportant, he commuted the court-martial's death sentence to life imprisonment.Barton, Brian. From Behind a Closed Door, Secret Court Martial Records of 1916, The History Press p. 93. De Valera had no Fenian family or personal background and his MI5 file in 1916 was very slim, detailing only his open membership in the Irish Volunteers.Barton, ibid., p. 92. Fourth, by the time de Valera was court-martialled on 8 May, political pressure was being brought to bear on Maxwell to halt the executions; Maxwell had already told British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that only two more were to be executed, Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada and James Connolly, although they were court-martialled the day after de Valera. His late trial, representations made by the American Consulate, his lack of Fenian background and political pressure all combined to save his life, though had he been tried a week earlier he would probably have been shot.Barton, ibid., pp. 91\u201394."]}, {"page": "Irish National Liberation Army", "response": ["The Irish Republican Socialist Party was founded on 8 December 1974 in the Spa Hotel in Lucan, Dublin, and the movement's military wing, the Irish National Liberation Army, was founded later the same day. The IRSP's foundation was made public but the INLA's was kept a secret until the group could operate effectively. One delegate suggested the armed wing be named the Irish Citizen Army after the paramilitary group founded by James Connolly that participated in the 1916 Easter Rising but this was rejected by Costello because of sectarian attacks carried out in Northern Ireland by another group using the same name. Costello advocated the name \"National Liberation Army\" and this appeared in some subsequent claims of responsibility for attacks, although delegates settled on \"Irish National Liberation Army\".Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions pp.32-33,pp.54 Unlike the Provisional IRA, and the Official IRA who also saw themselves as inheritors of the tradition, by no longer claiming to be the \"Irish Republican Army\" the INLA abandoned a series of perceived political inheritances which constructed a legal continuity from the Second D\u00e1il.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions pp.35-36,", "IRA and INLA prisoners convicted after March 1976 did not have Special Category Status applied in prison. Defending paramilitary prisoners right to special category status i.e. political status was an issue the IRSP and INLA advocated for from the outset, both within the prisons and on outside, when others, including the Provisional IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in, seemed reluctant to do so. This could be partly attributed to IRSP/INLA prisoners being immediately forced into confrontation with prison staff as soon as the movement was formed. Because IRSP prisoners were not members of the Official IRA or Provisional IRA they were denied political status while it was still granted and in summer 1975 twenty IRSP prisoners went on hunger strike for the right to wear their own clothes, to associates freely, refuse to do prison work, and to elect their own spokesmen. These would later become the core of the five demands of the H-Block protest and 1981 hunger strike was fought. As the 1 March 1976 deadline for the removal of special category status approached the Northern Ireland Office met with a council of representing all paramilitary organisations, loyalist and republican, inside Long Kesh prison. The British offered concessions in return for the removal of special category status. Only the IRSP would go on to flatly refuse the offer. On 14 November the first IRSP/INLA prisoner, James Connolly Brady of Derry, joined the blanket protest. Both the INLA and IRA attacked prison staff outside the prison. However unlike Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRSP engaged in popular agitation on the streets in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and elsewhere. Behind the public rhetoric there was deep concern within the IRSP about the commitment of the IRA/Sinn F\u00e9in to the H-Block protest; Sinn F\u00e9in had voted at its Ard Chomhairle to prohibit cooperation with the IRSP in protest activities in the South and in June 1978 Sinn F\u00e9in protests stopped as it emerged the IRA were in secret negotiations with mediators. According to Holland and McDonald, \"as conditions inside the H-Blocks deteriorated, so did relations between the IRSP and the Provisionals.\" The Sinn F\u00e9in Ard-Chomhairle put out a directive in September 1978 banning any IRSP speaker from sharing a Provisional speaker, and at a meeting held in Liberty Hall to discuss the prison crisis all the Provisionals walked out when Mick Plunkett stood up to speak. The IRA regarded the prisons campaign as a distraction the armed struggle and were reluctant to get too involved in any protest movement they couldn't control.
