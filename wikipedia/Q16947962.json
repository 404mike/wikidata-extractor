Paul Brannen, Jamie Driscoll, Nick Forbes and Ian Grayson nominated themselves at this point. Grayson withdrew from selection in December, announcing his support for Forbes.  To be on the selection ballot, candidates need at least two nominations from local parties or affiliated trade unions. The party re-opened self-nominations in December 2018 in the hope of improving the diversity of candidates available. North Tyneside councillor Karen Lee nominated herself in this round. Driscoll received nominations from five Constituency Labour Party's and four affiliated trade unions, whilst Forbes received nominations from four Constituency Labour Party's and five affiliated trade unions and Lee was nominated by two Constituency Labour Party's. Brannen withdrew with one nomination from a trade union. Lee withdrew in January, considering her late entry into the selection to have limited her campaign.", "Driscoll was backed by Noam Chomsky, Clive Lewis, Ken Loach, Paul Mason, John McDonnell and Laura Pidcock.
