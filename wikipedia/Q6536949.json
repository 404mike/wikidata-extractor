He signed an album deal with Massive Attack's Virgin Records imprint Melankolic who released his first LP, Masquerades & Silhouettes, in 1998, and follow-up album It's All Happening Now four years later, before he went on to produce a number of records for UK hip hop artists such as Jehst, The Sundragon and Champions of Nature. Parker has also been credited for his work with Ghostface Killah on the albums Fishscale and More Fish. \nOn September 1, 2009, he released The Rise and Fall of River Nelson with revered American rapper River Nelson, and the album received stellar reviews, with Andy Gill from The Independent writing,  \"The Rise and Fall of River Nelson shows River's thoughtful sentiments and positive attitude set to infectious symphonic-soul beats by British producer Lewis Parker.\" Parker and Nelson then released River's album The Shape of They Sky in October of 2013, with Jamsphere Magazine writing, \"It is one of those albums that fascinates you upon first listen and it keeps you hooked until the end.\"\nIn 2010, Parker also released a critically acclaimed album with American MC John Robinson called International Summers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vanity label", "response": ["| AlphaHorace AndyCraig ArmstrongDay OneLewis ParkerSunna"]}, {"page": "British hip hop", "response": ["In 1998, Mark B and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from Lewis Parker and Mr Thing (of the Scratch Perverts). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album The Unknown, which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by Feeder frontman Grant Nicholas, after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from Aspects, a benchmark release within the movement. Roots Manuva, Blak Twang, Mud Family, Ti2bs, Task Force, Phi Life Cypher, MSI & Asylum, Jeep Beat Collective and Ty all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts Rodney P, Mike J, and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene.

Premonitions was recorded in Leeds with Evil Ed on production and featuring a number of early YNR artists such as Tommy Evans, Nmonic, Asaviour, Taharka, Usmaan, Nexus 6. An initial run of just 500 copies of the Premonitions EP are thought to have been produced and distributed by hand (these early copies can be distinguished by the blue ink used to print the text on the sleeve.) Jehsts solo career extended further when he appeared on Task Force's EP Voice of the Great Outdoors (2000) with the track 'Cosmic Gypsies', which resulted in a longtime association with Low Life Records. The release of four 12\" records on the same label soon followed, while at around the same time in 2002 Jehst was also a pivotal member of the seven-man group Champions of Nature, whose members included AM, Apollo, L. Dolo, Lewis Parker, Profound, and Supa T (a.k.a. The Sundragon). The group eventually released two EP's before disbanding, but not before the final release of the acclaimed album, The Return of the Drifter.
