However, he missed the end-of-season run-in due to suspension after referee Mark Halsey gave him a straight red card for an alleged elbow on Manchester United's Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. The club appealed the suspension but was unsuccessful, and he was forced to miss the cup final as Arsenal defeated Southampton to retain the trophy, though they ended the league campaign in second place. His performances were recognised with a place on the PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammates Lauren, Ashley Cole, Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires and Thierry Henry."]}, {"page": "Robbie Savage", "response": ["Savage is also famous for an incident at Villa Park, while playing for Birmingham City, in a bad-tempered Second City derby in March 2003.

He was voted Player of the Season at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. Manager Billy Davies said of Cohen, \"He's a player with a wonderful attitude, can play in several positions, has tremendous energy and has got outstanding ability\". In May 2009, Cohen was rewarded with a new four-year contract until 2013. In the first leg of the 2009\u201310 Championship play-off semi-final against Blackpool on 8 May 2010, Cohen put Forest ahead with a curling outside-foot volley at Bloomfield Road. Cohen was controversially sent off in an away fixture against Leeds United on 2 April 2011, following his challenge on George McCartney.

The Goodison Park fans would appreciate his commitment and re-invigorate Kilbane as a player. In return, he displayed great versatility which resulted in him being deployed right across the midfield, at left back or even as a support striker, as well has his preferred left-wing position. On 26 August 2006, during his last game for Everton against Tottenham Hotspur, he was sent off by referee Mark Halsey for two bookable offences."]}, {"page": "Ryan Shawcross", "response": ["Prior to the start of the 2011\u201312 season, manager Tony Pulis confirmed that Shawcross would remain as club captain.

He was named as captain for a third season running, with Pulis warning Shawcross against complacency. In a Premier League match against Everton on 15 December 2012 Shawcross was deliberately headbutted by Marouane Fellaini which was missed by referee Mark Halsey. After the match Fellaini issued a public apology to Shawcross and was given a retrospective three match ban. On 3 January 2013, Shawcross signed a -year contract extension with the \"Potters\", keeping him at the Britannia Stadium until the summer of 2018. After agreeing to his new contract, Tony Pulis stated that Shawcross could go on to become a legend at the club.
