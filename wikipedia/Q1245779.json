From 1977 until 1992 he served as the Director of the British Museum, where he had previously worked, from 1955 to 1964, as an assistant keeper. In his role as director of the museum, he became embroiled in the controversy over the ownership of the Elgin Marbles with the Greek government, engaging with a \"disastrous\" televised debate with Greek Minister of Culture Melina Mercouri.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 30", "response": ["*  1931   \u2013 David M.

Apart from panels of ornament, the scenes include a Christian crucifixion, and possibly another scene in Hell, but the other scenes are generally interpreted as narrative incidents from the  story, even by a scholar as cautious of such interpretations as David M. Wilson. The  battle itself may be depicted on the north side. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, with one foot thrust into the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, and the other is against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as V\u00ed\u00f0arr fighting Fenrir."]}, {"page": "Sutton Hoo", "response": ["David M.

She would serve in that position for two terms until 1989, when PASOK lost the elections and New Democracy formed a cabinet. As Minister for Culture, Mercouri took advantage of her earlier career to promote Greece to other European leaders. She strongly advocated the return to Athens of the Parthenon Marbles, that were removed from Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, and are now part of the British Museum collection in London. In 1983, she engaged in a televised debate with the then director of the British Museum, David M. Wilson, which was interpreted by many as a public relations disaster for the British Museum. In anticipation of the return of the marbles, she held an international competition for the construction of the New Acropolis Museum, designated to display them and finally established in 2008."]}, {"page": "Alfred Jewel", "response": ["No other context is given in the preface, but in the context of books, the Old English word \"aestel\" can mean a \"guide\", \"index\", and also a \"handle\";Bosworth, A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language, p. 11 so, it is concluded that it meant a small pointer.

David M. Wilson sounded a note of caution as to the connection with Alfred, noting that \"in a period when royal titles meant something, there is no royal title in the inscription\".  However the commissioning by Alfred and the function as a pointer handle are taken as firmly established by Leslie Webster in her survey Anglo-Saxon Art of 2012,Webster 2012, 154-156; and see Index. as well as by the Ashmolean.\"Object\".

However quantity was not matched by quality, and even the products of the main city, York, are described by David M. Wilson as \"generally miserable and slipshod\".Wilson, 142\u2013152; 142 \"more than 500; 144 (quote) In the early stages the successive styles of Norse art appear in England, but gradually as political and cultural ties weakened the Anglo-Scandinavians fail to keep up with trends in the homeland. So elements of the Borre style are seen, for example in the \"ring-chain\" interlace on the Gosforth Cross, and then the complex animals of the Jelling style are mostly rather incompetently depicted in England, but traces of the next Mammen style are hard to detect; they are much clearer on the Isle of Man. They are \"perhaps, dimly\" evident in the cross shaft from St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester (illustrated above right). In general the traces of these styles in other media are even fainter.Wilson, 142\u2013149, quote 147 A uniquely Anglo-Scandinavian form is the hogback, low grave-marker shaped like a long house with a pitched roof, and sometimes muzzled bears clutching on to each end. Ornament is sometimes a crude pattern of scoring, or scale-like elements presumably representing roofing shingles, but may include interlace and images.Wilson, 149; Laing's typology is shown in 3 pages of drawings here  from the AS Sculpture Corpus website; photo of good examples from Brompton, Yorkshire"]}, {"page": "Viking art", "response": ["Importantly, it was the English archaeologist David M.
