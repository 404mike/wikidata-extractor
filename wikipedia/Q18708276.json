Thereafter, the king did not wish to hear mention of the dunghill.Babylonian Talmud Chagigah 16a (Sasanian Empire, 6th century), in, e.g., Talmud Bavli: Tractate Chagigah, elucidated by Dovid Kamenetsky, Henoch Levin, Feivel Wahl, Israel Schneider, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1999), volume 22, page 16a2. Similarly, the Mishnah taught that one should not teach about the Creation to more than one student.Mishnah Chagigah 2:1 (Land of Israel, circa 200 CE), in, e.g., Jacob Neusner, translator, The Mishnah: A New Translation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), page 330; Babylonian Talmud Chagigah 11b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli: Tractate Chagigah, elucidated by Dovid Kamenetsky, et al., volume 22, page 11b2.", "A Midrash (rabbinic commentary) explained that six things preceded the creation of the world: the Torah and the Throne of Glory were created, the creation of the Patriarchs was contemplated, the creation of Israel was contemplated, the creation of the Temple in Jerusalem was contemplated, and the name of the Messiah was contemplated, as well as repentance.Genesis Rabbah 1:4, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 6.", "A Midrash taught that a heretic once asked Rabbi Akiva who created the world. Rabbi Akiva answered that God had. The heretic demanded that Rabbi Akiva give him clear proof. Rabbi Akiva asked him what he was wearing. The heretic said that it was a garment. Rabbi Akiva asked him who made it. The heretic replied that a weaver had. Rabbi Akiva demanded that the heretic give him proof. The heretic asked Rabbi Akiva whether he did not realize that a garment is made by a weaver. Rabbi Akiva replied by asking the heretic whether he did not realize that the world was made by God. When the heretic had left, Rabbi Akiva's disciples asked him to explain his proof. Rabbi Akiva replied that just as a house implies a builder, a dress implies a weaver, and a door implies a carpenter, so the world proclaims the God who created it.Midrash Temurah, in Menahem M.

Similarly, Rabbi Judah bar Simon interpreted , \u201cAnd God called the light day,\u201d to symbolize Jacob/Israel; \u201cand the darkness he called night,\u201d to symbolize Esau; \u201cand there was evening,\u201d to symbolize Esau; \u201cand there was morning,\u201d to symbolize Jacob. And \u201cone day\u201d teaches that God gave Israel one unique day over which darkness has no influence \u2014 the Day of Atonement.Genesis Rabbah 2:3, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 16\u201317.", "Rabbi Judah ben Pazi noted that a similar word appears in both  \u2014 where , rakiya is translated as \"firmament\" \u2014 and  \u2014 where , vayraku is translated as \"and they flattened.\" He thus deduced from the usage in  that  taught that on the second day of creation, God spread the heavens flat like a cloth.Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 6a (Land of Israel, circa 400 CE), in, e.g., Talmud Yerushalmi, elucidated by Eliezer Herzka, Eliezer Lachman, Henoch Moshe Levin, Avrohom Neuberger, Michoel Weiner, Abba Zvi Naiman, Zev Meisels, and Dovid Arye Kaufman, edited by Chaim Malinowitz, Yisroel Simcha Schorr, and Mordechai Marcus (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2005), volume 1, page 6a2. Or Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon deduced from  that  meant \"let a lining be made for the firmament.\"Genesis Rabbah 4:2, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 27.", "Noting that  uses the plural pronoun when God says, \"Let us make man,\" the heretics asked Rabbi Simlai how many deities created the world. Rabbi Simlai replied that wherever one finds a point apparently supporting the heretics, one finds the refutation nearby in the text. Thus  says, \"Let us make man\" (using the plural pronoun), but then  says, \"And God created\" (using the singular pronoun). When the heretics had departed, Rabbi Simlai's disciples told him that they thought that he had dismissed the heretics with a mere makeshift, and asked him for the real answer. Rabbi Simlai then told his disciples that in the first instance, God created Adam from dust and Eve from Adam, but thereafter God would create humans (in the words of ) \"in Our image, after Our likeness,\" neither man without woman nor woman without man, and neither of them without the Shechinah (the indwelling nurturing presence of God, designated with a feminine noun).Genesis Rabbah 8:9, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 60.", "Similarly, Rabbi asked Rabbi Ishmael the son of Rabbi Jose if he had learned from his father the actual meaning of , \"And on the seventh day God finished the work that He had been doing\" (for surely God finished God's work on the sixth day, not the Sabbath). He compared it to a man striking a hammer on an anvil, raising it by day and bringing it down immediately after nightfall. (In the second between raising the hammer and bringing it down, night began. Thus, he taught that God finished God's work right at the end of the sixth day, so that in that very moment the Sabbath began.) Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that mortal humans, who do not know exactly what time it is, must add from the profane to the sacred to avoid working in the sacred time; but God knows time precisely, can enter the Sabbath by a hair's breadth. Genibah and the Rabbis discussed . Genibah compared it to a king who made a bridal chamber, which he plastered, painted, and adorned, so that all that the bridal chamber lacked was a bride to enter it. Similarly, just then, the world lacked the Sabbath. (Thus by means of instituting the Sabbath itself, God completed God's work, and humanity's world, on the seventh day.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who made a ring that lacked only a signet. Similarly, the world lacked the Sabbath. And the Midrash taught that this is one of the texts that they changed for King Ptolemy (as they could not expect him to understand these explanations), making  read, \"And He finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh.\" King Ptolemy (or others say, a philosopher) asked the elders in Rome how many days it took God to create the world. The elders replied that it took God six days. He replied that since then, Gehenna has been burning for the wicked. Reading the words \"His work\" in , Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon that with neither labor nor toil did God create the world, yet  says, \"He rested . . . from all His work.\" He explained that  states it that way to punish the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with labor, and to give a good reward to the righteous who uphold the world, which was created with toil. Reading the words \"Because that in it He rested from all His work which God created to make,\" in , the Midrash taught that what was created on the Sabbath, after God rested, was tranquility, ease, peace, and quiet. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Nehorai that as long as the hands of their Master were working on them, they went on expanding; but when the hands of their Master rested, rest was afforded to them, and thus God gave rest to the world on the seventh day. Rabbi Abba taught that when a mortal king takes his army to their quarters, he does not distribute largesse (rather, he does that only before the troops go into battle), and when he distributes largesse, he does not order a halt. But God ordered a halt and distributed largesse, as  says, \"And He rested . . . and He blessed.\" (Not only did God afford humanity a day of rest, but God also gave humanity the gift of a sacred day.)Genesis Rabbah 10:9, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 77\u201379.", "A Midrash deduced from similarities in the language of the creation of humanity and the Sabbath commandment that God gave Adam the precept of the Sabbath. Reading the report of God\u2019s creating Adam in , \u201cAnd He put him (, vayanihehu) into the Garden of Eden,\u201d the Midrash taught that \u201cAnd He put him (, vayanihehu)\u201d means that God gave Adam the precept of the Sabbath, for the Sabbath commandment uses a similar word in  (20:11 in NJPS), \u201cAnd rested (, vayanach) on the seventh day.\u201d  continues, \u201cto till it (, le\u2019avedah),\u201d and the Sabbath commandment uses a similar word in  (20:9 in NJPS), \u201cSix days shall you labor (, ta\u2019avod).\u201d And  continues, \u201cAnd to keep it (, ule-shamerah),\u201d and the Sabbath commandment uses a similar word in  (5:12 in NJPS), \u201cKeep (, shamor) the Sabbath day.\u201dGenesis Rabbah 16:5. In, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 130.", "Similarly, a Midrash recounts that Rabbi Jeremiah ben Leazar taught that when God created Adam, God created him a hermaphrodite \u2014 two bodies, male and female, joined together \u2014 for  says, \"male and female created He them . . . and called their name Adam.\" Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman taught that when God created Adam, God created Adam double-faced, then God split Adam and made Adam of two backs, one back on this side and one back on the other side. An objection was raised that  says, \"And He took one of his ribs\" (implying that God created Eve separately from Adam). Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman replied that the word read as \"rib\" \u2014 , mi-zalotav \u2014 actually means one of Adam's sides, just as one reads in , \"And for the second side (, zela) of the tabernacle.\"Genesis Rabbah 8:1, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 54.", "Reading God's observation in  that \"it is not good that the man should be alone,\" a Midrash taught that a man without a wife dwells without good, without help, without joy, without blessing, and without atonement. Without good, as  says that \"it is not good that the man should be alone.\" Without help, as in , God says, \"I will make him a help meet for him.\" Without joy, as  says, \"And you shall rejoice, you and your household\" (implying that one can rejoice only when there is a \"household\" with whom to rejoice). Without a blessing, as  can be read, \"To cause a blessing to rest on you for the sake of your house\" (that is, for the sake of your wife). Without atonement, as  says, \"And he shall make atonement for himself, and for his house\" (implying that one can make complete atonement only with a household). Rabbi Simeon said in the name of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, without peace too, as 1 Samuel  says, \"And peace be to your house.\" Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, without life too, as Ecclesiastes  says, \"Enjoy life with the wife whom you love.\" Rabbi Hiyya ben Gomdi said, also incomplete, as  says, \"male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam,\" that is, \"man\" (and thus only together are they \"man\"). Some say a man without a wife even impairs the Divine likeness, as  says, \"For in the image of God made He man,\" and immediately thereafter  says, \"And you, be fruitful, and multiply (implying that the former is impaired if one does not fulfill the latter).Genesis Rabbah 17:2, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 132\u201333.", "Interpreting the words \"And the man said: \u2018This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman'\" in , Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi taught that the first time God created a woman for Adam, he saw her full of discharge and blood. So God removed her from Adam and recreated her a second time.Genesis Rabbah 18:4, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 142.", "Judah ben Padiah noted Adam's frailty, for he could not remain loyal even for a single hour to God's charge that he not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, yet in accordance with , Adam's descendants the Israelites waited three years for the fruits of a tree.Genesis Rabbah 21:7, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 176\u201377.", "Reading the words of , \"And Cain spoke to Abel his brother,\" a Midrash imagined the subject of their discussion. The Midrash taught that they divided the world between them. The first took the land and the second took the movables. The first told the second that he was standing on the first's land. The second retorted that the first was wearing the second's clothes. The second told the first to strip off his clothes. The first retorted that the second should fly off his ground. Out of this quarrel, as  reports, \"Cain rose up against his brother Abel.\" Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in Rabbi Levi's name, however, that Cain and Abel quarreled because one said that the Temple would have to be built in his area, while the other claimed that it would have to be built in his. For  says, \"And it came to pass, when they were in the field,\" and \"field\" refers to the Temple, as  equates the two when it says, \"Zion (that is, the Temple) shall be plowed as a field.\" Out of this argument (in the words of ), \"Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\" Judah the son of Rabbi, however, said that their quarrel was about the first Eve. But Rabbi Aibu said that the first Eve had by then returned to dust. Rav Huna taught that Cain and Abel quarreled over an additional twin daughter who was born with Abel, whom each brother claimed for his own. Cain said that he would have her, because he was the firstborn, while Abel maintained that he would have to have her, because she was born with him.Genesis Rabbah 22:7, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 187.", "Reading the words of , \"And Cain rose up against his brother Abel,\" Rabbi Johanan taught that Abel was stronger than Cain, for the expression \"rose up\" implies that Cain lay beneath Abel (as if they had already fought and Abel had thrown Cain down). From the ground, Cain asked Abel what he would tell their father if Abel killed him. At this, Abel was filled with pity for Cain and relented, and immediately Cain rose against Abel and killed him. Out of that incident was born the proverb, \"Do not do good to an evil man, then evil will not befall you.\"Genesis Rabbah 22:8, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 187.", "Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai compared Cain and Abel to two gladiators fighting before a king. Had the king wished, he could have separated them, but he did not do so. One overcame the other and killed him. Before he died, the victim cried out to the king for help. Rabbi Simeon thus noted that changing one letter in  would cause God's statement to read, \"The voice of your brother's blood cries out against Me.\" Rabbi Simeon said that it is difficult to say this thing, and the mouth cannot utter it plainly (but by God's inaction, God was involved in Abel's murder).Genesis Rabbah 22:9, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 188\u201389.", "Reading in  that God said, \"every living substance (, yekum) that I have made will I blot out,\" Rabbi Abin taught that this included the one who rose up (, yakam) against his brother \u2014 Cain. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Resh Lakish that God kept Cain's judgment in suspense until the Flood and then God swept Cain away. And thus Rabbi Levi read  to say, \"And He blotted out every one that had arisen.\"Genesis Rabbah 32:5, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 252.", "Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said that Naamah, the sister of Tubal-cain, mentioned in , was Noah's wife. She was called Naamah, because her deeds were pleasing (ne'imim). But the Rabbis said that Naamah was a woman of a different stamp, for her name denotes that she sang (man'emet) to the timbrel in honor of idolatry.Genesis Rabbah 23:3, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 194.", "Ben Azzai taught that the words of , \"This is the book of the descendants of Adam,\" teach a great principle of the Torah. But Rabbi Akiva replied that the words of , \"you shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" teach an even greater principle. Hence, one must not say, \"Since I have been put to shame, let my neighbor be put to shame.\" And Rabbi Tanhuma taught that those who do so must know Whom they put to shame, for  reports of humankind, \"In the likeness of God made He him.\"Genesis Rabbah 24:7, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 204.", "Rabbi Tanhuma taught in Rabbi Banayah's name, and Rabbi Berekiah taught in Rabbi Eleazar's name, that God created Adam a shapeless mass, and Adam lay stretching from one end of the world to the other, as  says, \"Your eyes did see my shapeless mass.\" Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon taught that while Adam lay a shapeless mass before God, God showed Adam every succeeding generation of mankind and its Sages, judges, scribes, interpreters, and leaders. God told Adam, in the words of , \"Your eyes did see unformed substance,\" Adam's potential descendants, and God told Adam that all of those descendants had already been written in the book of Adam, as  says: \"This is the book of the generations of Adam.\"Genesis Rabbah 24:2, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 199\u2013200.", "Noting that  says of Enoch not that he died, but that \"God took him,\" some sectarians (Judeo-Christians or Christians) challenged Rabbi Abbahu, saying that they did not find that Enoch died, but that God \"took\" him, just as  says that God would \"take\" Elijah. Rabbi Abbahu reasoned that one could read the verb \"took\" in  just as \"take\" is used in , which says, \"Behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes,\" and there \"take\" definitely refers to death.Genesis Rabbah 25:1, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 205.", "Reading the words of , \"the sons of God (, bene elohim) saw the daughters of men,\" Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai called them \"the sons of nobles,\" and Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai cursed all who called them \"the sons of God.\" Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that all real demoralization proceeds from the leaders, as they are in a position to stop it. Rabbi Haninah and Resh Lakish reasoned that  calls them \"the sons of God\" because they lived a long time without trouble or suffering.Genesis Rabbah 26:5, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 213.", "Rav Huna said in Rav Joseph's name that the generation of the flood were not blotted out from the world until they composed nuptial songs (or others say, wrote marriage contracts) in honor of pederasty and bestiality.Genesis Rabbah 26:5, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 213\u201314.", "Noting that  calls Noah \"a man\" (, ish), a Midrash taught that wherever Scripture employs the term \"a man\" (, ish), it indicates a righteous man who warned his generation.

When they would ask him what he was doing, he would reply that God had informed him that God was bringing a flood. Noah's contemporaries replied that if a flood did come, it would come only on Noah's father's house.

The man became embarrassed and left. On another occasion, a woman came with a plate of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols. Abram took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol's hand. When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he had done. Abram told Terah that the idols fought among themselves to be fed first, and the largest broke the others with the stick. Terah asked Abram why he made sport of him, for the idols had no consciousness. Abram replied by asking Terah to listen to what he had just said. Thereupon Terah seized Abram and delivered him to Nimrod, king of Shinar. Nimrod proposed that they worship the fire. Abram replied that they should rather worship water, which extinguishes fire. Nimrod agreed to worship water. Abram replied that they should rather worship clouds, which bear the water. Nimrod agreed to worship the clouds. Abram replied that they should rather worship the winds, which disperse the clouds. Nimrod agreed to worship the wind. Abram replied that they should rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind. Nimrod then accused Abram of just bandying words, and decreed that they would worship nothing but the fire. Nimrod cast Abram into the fire, challenging Abram's God to save him from it. Haran was standing there undecided. Haran thought to himself that if Abram survived, then Haran would say that he was of Abram's faith, but if Nimrod was victorious, then Haran would say that he was on Nimrod's side. When Abram descended into the fiery furnace, God saved him. Nimrod then asked Haran whose belief he shared. Haran replied that he shared Abram's faith.

The Midrash deduced that God thus showed Abraham three kinds of bullocks, three kinds of goats, and three kinds of rams that Abraham's descendants would need to sacrifice. The three kinds of bullocks were: (1) the bullock that  would require the Israelites to sacrifice on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), (2) the bullock that  would require the Israelites to bring on account of unwitting transgression of the law, and (3) the heifer whose neck  would require the Israelites to break. The three kinds of goats were: (1) the goats that  would require the Israelites to sacrifice on festivals, (2) the goats that  would require the Israelites to sacrifice on the New Moon (Rosh Chodesh), and (3) the goat that  would require an individual to bring. The three kinds of rams were: (1) the guilt-offering of certain obligation that , for example, would require one who committed a trespass to bring, (2) the guilt-offering of doubt to which one would be liable when in doubt whether one had committed a transgression, and (3) the lamb to be brought by an individual.

Similarly, to Abraham, whose moral strength was great, God said, \"Walk before Me.\" But of Noah, who was feeble,  says, \"Noah walked with God.\" Rabbi Nehemiah compared Noah to a king's friend who was plunging about in dark alleys, and when the king saw him sinking in the mud, the king urged his friend to walk with him instead of plunging about. Abraham's case, however, was compared to that of a king who was sinking in dark alleys, and when his friend saw him, the friend shined a light for him through the window. The king then asked his friend to come and shine a light before the king on his way. Thus, God told Abraham that instead of showing a light for God from Mesopotamia, he should come and show one before God in the Land of Israel. Similarly,  says, \"And he blessed Joseph, and said: The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk .\u00a0... \" Rabbi Berekiah in Rabbi Johanan's name and Resh Lakish gave two illustrations of this.

Resh Lakish said: It was as if a prince walked along while the elders preceded him (as an escort, to make known his coming). (Similarly, Abraham and Isaac walked before God, spreading word of God.) The Midrash taught that in Rabbi Johanan's view: We need God's proximity, while in Resh Lakish's view, God needs us to glorify God (by propagating the knowledge of God's greatness).Genesis Rabbah 30:10, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 238. Similarly, a Midrash read the words \"Noah walked with God\" in  to mean that God supported Noah, so that Noah should not be overwhelmed by the evil behavior of the generation of the Flood. The Midrash compared this to a king whose son went on a mission for his father. The road ahead of him was sunken in mire, and the king supported him so that he would not sink in the mire. However, in the case of Abraham, God said in , \"walk before Me,\" and regarding the Patriarchs, Jacob said in , \"The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked.\" For the Patriarchs would try to anticipate the Divine Presence, and would go ahead to do God's will.Midrash Tanhuma Noach 5, in, e.g., Metsudah Midrash Tanchuma.

And thus if one righteous person can be found in a city, it can be saved in the merit of that righteous person.Genesis Rabbah 49:13, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 432.", "The Rabbis in a Midrash asked why the angels took so long to travel from Abraham's camp to Sodom, leaving Abraham at noon and arriving in Sodom only (as  reports) \"in the evening.\" The Midrash explained that they were angels of mercy, and thus they delayed, thinking that perhaps Abraham might find something to change Sodom's fate, but when Abraham found nothing, as  reports, \"the two angels came to Sodom in the evening.\"Genesis Rabbah 50:1, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, page 434.", "A Midrash noted that in , the visitors are called \"angels,\" whereas in , they were called \"men.\" The Midrash explained that earlier, when the Shechinah (the Divine Presence) was above them, Scripture called them men, but as soon as the Shechinah departed from them, they assumed the form of angels. Rabbi Levi (or others say Rabbi Tan\u1e25uma in the name of Rabbi Levi) said that to Abraham, whose spiritual strength was great, they looked like men (as Abraham was as familiar with angels as with men). But to Lot, whose spiritual strength was weak, they appeared as angels. Rabbi \u1e24anina taught that before they performed their mission, they were called \"men.\" But having performed their mission, they are referred to as \"angels.\" Rabbi Tan\u1e25uma compared them to a person who received a governorship from the king. Before reaching the seat of authority, the person goes about like an ordinary citizen. Similarly, before they performed their mission, Scripture calls them \"men,\" but having performed their mission, Scripture calls them \"angels.\"Genesis Rabbah 50:2, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 434\u201335.", "The Gemara asked what differed between the incident involving Abraham, where the angels acquiesced immediately to Abraham's request to remain with him, as in , they said, \u201cSo do, as you have said,\u201d and the incident involving Lot, where the angels first displayed reluctance, as  reports, \u201cAnd he urged them greatly,\u201d only after which the two angels acquiesced.

Expanding on the words, \"but before they lay down\" in , the Midrash told that the angels began questioning Lot, inquiring into the nature of the people of the city. Lot replied that in every town there are good people and bad people, but in Sodom the overwhelming majority were bad. Then (in the words of ) \"the men of the city, the men of sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old,\" not one of them objecting. And then (in the words of ) \"they called to Lot, and said to him: 'Where are the men that came to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.'\" Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said in the name of Rabbi Padiah that Lot prayed for mercy on the Sodomites' behalf the whole night, and the angels would have heeded him. But when the Sodomites demanded (in the words of ) \"Bring them out to us, that we may know them,\" that is, for sexual purposes, the angels asked Lot (in the words of ) \"Do you have here (, poh) any besides?\" Which one could read as asking, \"What else do you have in your mouth (, peh) (to say in their favor)?\" Then the angels told Lot that up until then, he had the right to plead in their defense, but thereafter, he had no right to plead for them.Genesis Rabbah 50:5, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 1, pages 437\u201338.", "Reading the words of , \"God remembered Abraham and sent out Lot,\" a Midrash asked what recollection was brought up in Lot's favor?

Thus Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba taught that if one begins a precept and does not complete it, the result will be that he will bury his wife and children. The Midrash cited as support for this proposition the experience of Judah, who began a precept and did not complete it. When Joseph came to his brothers and they sought to kill him, as Joseph's brothers said in  \"Come now therefore, and let us slay him,\" Judah did not let them, saying in  \"What profit is it if we slay our brother?\" and they listened to him, for he was their leader. And had Judah called for Joseph's brothers to restore Joseph to their father, they would have listened to him then, as well. Thus because Judah began a precept (the good deed toward Joseph) and did not complete it, he buried his wife and two sons, as  reports, \"Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died,\" and  further reports, \"Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.\" In another Midrash reading \"heart\" and \"mouth\" in  to symbolize the beginning and the end of fulfilling a precept, Rabbi Levi said in the name of Hama bar Hanina that if one begins a precept and does not complete it, and another comes and completes it, it is attributed to the one who has completed it. The Midrash illustrated this by citing how Moses began a precept by taking the bones of Joseph with him, as  reports, \"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him.\" But because Moses never brought Joseph's bones into the Land of Israel, the precept is attributed to the Israelites, who buried them, as  reports, \"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem.\"  does not say, \"Which Moses brought up out of Egypt,\" but \"Which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt.\" And the Midrash explained that the reason that they buried Joseph's bones in Shechem could be compared to a case in which some thieves stole a cask of wine, and when the owner discovered them, the owner told them that after they had consumed the wine, they needed to return the cask to its proper place. So when the brothers sold Joseph, it was from Shechem that they sold him, as  reports, \"And Israel said to Joseph: 'Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem?'\" God told the brothers that since they had sold Joseph from Shechem, they needed to return Joseph's bones to Shechem.

Joseph too had remembered what subject they had been studying, so (as  reports) he sent Jacob wagons (, agalot) so that Jacob might know that the gift came from him.

Rabbi Jo\u1e25anan said that the reason was because a person owes more honor to a parent than to a grandparent. Resh Lakish said that Jacob offered sacrifices (in thanksgiving) for the covenant with the ancestors (which Isaac had conveyed to Jacob with his blessing). Bar Kappara discussed the question with Rabbi Jose bar Patros. One of them said that Jacob declared that as Isaac had been eager for his food (for, as  reports, Isaac loved Esau because Esau brought Isaac venison), so Jacob was eager for his food (and thus was headed to Egypt to avoid the famine). The other explained that as Isaac had distinguished between his sons (as  reports, loving Esau more than Jacob), so Jacob would distinguish among his sons (going to Egypt for Joseph's account alone). But then Jacob noted on reconsideration that Isaac was responsible for only one soul, whereas Jacob was responsible for 70 souls. Rabbi Judan said that Jacob declared that Isaac blessed him with five blessings, and God correspondingly appeared five times to Jacob and blessed him (in , , , , and ). Rabbi Judan also said that Jacob wanted to thank God for permitting Jacob to see the fulfillment of those blessings. And the blessing that was fulfilled was that of , \"Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you,\" which was fulfilled with regard to Joseph. (And thus, Jacob mentioned Isaac then on going down to witness Joseph's greatness.) Rabbi Berekiah observed that God never unites God's Name with a living person (to say, for example, \"I am the God of Jacob,\" while they are alive) except with those who are experiencing suffering. (And thus Jacob referred to the God of Isaac instead of the God of Jacob.) And Rabbi Berekiah also observed that Isaac did indeed experience suffering. The Rabbis said that we look upon Isaac as if his ashes were heaped in a pile on the altar.

Thus Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba taught that if one begins a precept and does not complete it, the result will be that he will bury his wife and children. The Midrash cited as support for this proposition the experience of Judah, who began a precept and did not complete it. When Joseph came to his brothers and they sought to kill him, as Joseph's brothers said in , \"Come now therefore, and let us slay him,\" Judah did not let them, saying in , \"What profit is it if we slay our brother?\" and they listened to him, for he was their leader. And had Judah called for Joseph's brothers to restore Joseph to their father, they would have listened to him then, as well.

The Midrash thus concluded that they were not the strongest of the brothers, and named them as Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Benjamin, and Issachar. The Midrash explained that Joseph took these five brothers, because he reasoned that if he presented the strongest to Pharaoh, then Pharaoh would on make them his warriors. Therefore, Joseph presented these five, who were not mighty men. The Midrash taught that we know that they were not strong from the blessing of Moses in , where every brother whose name Moses repeated in his blessing was mighty, while every brother whose name Moses did not repeat was not mighty.

In the Babylonian Talmud, however, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari who the five were. Rabbah bar Mari replied that Rabbi Jo\u1e25anan said that they were those whose names were repeated in the Farewell of Moses,  (and thus the mightier of the brothers). Besides Judah, the five whose names Moses repeated were Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher and Naphtali. Explaining why Moses repeated Judah\u2019s name in , but Joseph nonetheless excluded him from the five, Rabbah bar Mari explained that Moses repeated Judah\u2019s name for a different purpose, which Rabbi Samuel bar Na\u1e25mani recounted that Rabbi Jo\u1e25anan said. Rabbi Jo\u1e25anan interpreted the words of , \u201cLet Reuben live and not die, in that his men become few, and this is for Judah,\u201d to teach that during the 40 years that the Israelites were in the wilderness, the bones of Judah rolled around detached in the coffin that conveyed the bones of the heads of the tribes from Egypt to the Promised Land along with Joseph's remains. But then Moses solicited God for mercy by noting that Judah brought Reuben to confess his own sin in  and  (lying with Bilhah) by himself making public confession in  (when Judah admitted that Tamar was more righteous than he was). Therefore, in , Moses exhorted God: \u201cHear Lord the voice of Judah!\u201d Thereupon God fitted each of Judah's limbs into its original place as one whole skeleton.

For example, the magicians said that the seven good cows meant that Pharaoh would have seven daughters and the seven ill-favored cows meant that Pharaoh would bury seven daughters. They told Pharaoh that the seven full ears of corn meant that Pharaoh would conquer seven provinces and the seven thin ears meant that seven provinces would revolt against him. Thus Rabbi Joshua concluded that the words of , \"A scorner seeks wisdom, and finds it not\", applied to Pharaoh's magicians, while the continuation of the verse, \"But knowledge is easy for him who has discernment\", applied to Joseph.Genesis Rabbah 89:6, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, volume 2, pages 823.", "A Midrash read the words of , \"he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt ... but there was none that could interpret them for Pharaoh\", to teach that every nation in the world appoints five wise men as its ministers.

The Midrash taught that the purpose of all this sending for and failing of magicians was so that Joseph might come at the end and be raised to high rank. God saw that if Joseph came at the beginning and interpreted the dream, Joseph would gain little praise, for the magicians would be able to say that had one asked them, we would have interpreted the dream long before. Therefore, God waited until the magicians had wearied and had exhausted Pharaoh's spirit, and then Joseph came and restored it.

Rabbi Judah thus argued that Joseph increased efficiency by decentralizing food distribution. The Rabbis observed that if all the citizens of Tiberias consumed the produce grown in Tiberias, and all the citizens of Sepphoris consumed the produce grown in Sepphoris, then they would not get a handful each.

The people replied that all the grain that they had left had rotted. Pharaoh asked them whether any flour was left from the day before. The people replied that even the bread in their baskets had gone moldy. Pharaoh answered that if grain rotted at Joseph's decree, perhaps he might decree that the Egyptians die.

Reading , \"For this commandment that I command you this day . . . is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart,\" a Midrash interpreted \"heart\" and \"mouth\" to symbolize the beginning and end of fulfilling a precept and thus read  as an exhortation to complete a good deed once started. Thus Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba taught that if one begins a precept and does not complete it, the result will be that he will bury his wife and children. The Midrash cited as support for this proposition the experience of Judah, who began a precept and did not complete it. When Joseph came to his brothers and they sought to kill him, as Joseph's brothers said in , \"Come now therefore, and let us slay him,\" Judah did not let them, saying in , \"What profit is it if we slay our brother?\" and they listened to him, for he was their leader. And had Judah called for Joseph's brothers to restore Joseph to their father, they would have listened to him then, as well. Thus because Judah began a precept (the good deed toward Joseph) and did not complete it, he buried his wife and two sons, as  reports, \"Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died,\" and  further reports, \"Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.\" In another Midrash reading \"heart\" and \"mouth\" in  to symbolize the beginning and the end of fulfilling a precept, Rabbi Levi said in the name of Hama bar Hanina that if one begins a precept and does not complete it, and another comes and completes it, it is attributed to the one who has completed it. The Midrash illustrated this by citing how Moses began a precept by taking the bones of Joseph with him, as  reports, \"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him.\" But because Moses never brought Joseph's bones into the Land of Israel, the precept is attributed to the Israelites, who buried them, as  reports, \"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem.\"  does not say, \"Which Moses brought up out of Egypt,\" but \"Which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt.\" And the Midrash explained that the reason that they buried Joseph's bones in Shechem could be compared to a case in which some thieves stole a cask of wine, and when the owner discovered them, the owner told them that after they had consumed the wine, they needed to return the cask to its proper place. So when the brothers sold Joseph, it was from Shechem that they sold him, as  reports, \"And Israel said to Joseph: 'Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem?'\" God told the brothers that since they had sold Joseph from Shechem, they needed to return Joseph's bones to Shechem.

Rabbi Levi said that the girdle was 32 cubits long (about 48 feet), and that the priest wound it towards the front and towards the back, and this was the ground for saying that it was to atone for the crooked in heart (as the numerical value of the Hebrew word for heart is 32). The one who said that the girdle atoned for thieves argued that since the girdle was hollow, it resembled thieves, who do their work in secret, hiding their stolen goods in hollows and caves. The breastplate atoned for those who pervert justice, as  says, \"And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment.\" The Ephod atoned for idol-worshippers, as  says, \"and without Ephod or teraphim.\" Rabbi Simon taught in the name of Rabbi Nathan that the robe atoned for two sins, unintentional manslaughter (for which the Torah provided cities of refuge) and evil speech.Leviticus Rabbah 10:6.

There is not strictly atonement for one who unintentionally slays a human being, but the Torah provides a means of atonement by the death of the High Priest, as  says, \"after the death of the High Priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.\" Some said that the forehead-plate atoned for the shameless, while others said for blasphemers. Those who said that it atoned for the shameless deduced it from the similar use of the word \"forehead\" in , which says of the forehead-plate, \"And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead,\" and , which says, \"You had a harlot's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.\" Those who said that the forehead-plate atoned for blasphemers deduced it from the similar use of the word \"forehead\" in  and , which says of Goliath, \"And the stone sank into his forehead.\"Leviticus Rabbah 10:6, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus.
