Burton performed the screen test for the role of Gareth, which Williams wrote especially for him, and was subsequently selected when Williams sent him a telegram that quoted a line from The Corn Is Green  \"You have won the scholarship.\" This led to Burton making his mainstream film debut. Filming took place during the summer and early autumn months of 1948. It was on the sets of this film that Burton was introduced by Williams to Sybil Williams, whom he married on 5 February 1949 at a register office in Kensington. The Last Days of Dolwyn opened to generally positive critical reviews. Burton was praised for his \"acting fire, manly bearing and good looks\" and film critic Philip French of The Guardian called it an \"impressive movie debut\". After marrying Sybil, Burton moved to his new address at 6 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead NW3, where he lived from 1949 to 1956."]}, {"page": "1950 in literature", "response": ["* Wynyard Browne \u2013 The Holly and the Ivy"]}, {"page": "1953 in literature", "response": ["*Wynyard Browne \u2013  A Question of Fact"]}, {"page": "Duchess Theatre", "response": ["* 1950 \u2013 The Holly and the Ivy by Wynyard Browne, featured Bryan Forbes."]}, {"page": "Paul Verhoeven (German director)", "response": ["* 1961: Die Sache mit dem Ring \u2014 (based on the play The Ring of Truth by Wynyard Browne)"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay", "response": ["* Hobson's Choice \u2013 David Lean, Norman Spencer, and Wynyard Browne"]}, {"page": "Auriol Smith", "response": ["*The Ring of Truth (Wynyard Browne) 2009"]}, {"page": "Jane Baxter", "response": ["* The Holly and the Ivy by Wynyard Browne (1950)"]}, {"page": "The Holly and the Ivy (film)", "response": ["The Holly and the Ivy is a 1952 British drama film adapted from the 1950 play of the same name by Wynyard Browne.
