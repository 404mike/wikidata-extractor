He was born in Birmingham and moved to London in 1889 to study at Trinity College of Music. After a brilliant studentship he did not pursue the classical career predicted for him, becoming musical director of the Vaudeville Theatre before gaining fame as a composer of light music and as a conductor of his own works.\nFor many years Ket\u00e8lbey worked for a series of music publishers, including Chappell & Co and the Columbia Graphophone Company, making arrangements for smaller orchestras, a period in which he learned to write fluent and popular music. He also found great success writing music for silent films until the advent of talking films in the late 1920s.\nThe composer's early works in conventional classical style were well received, but it was for his light orchestral pieces that he became best known. One of his earliest works in the genre, In a Monastery Garden (1915), sold over a million copies and brought him to widespread notice; his later musical depictions of exotic scenes caught the public imagination and established his fortune. Such works as In a Persian Market (1920), In a Chinese Temple Garden (1923), and In the Mystic Land of Egypt (1931) became best-sellers in print and on records; by the late 1920s he was Britain's first millionaire composer. His celebrations of British scenes were equally popular: examples include Cockney Suite (1924) with its scenes of London life, and his ceremonial music for royal events. His works were frequently recorded during his heyday, and a substantial part of his output has been put on CD in more recent years.\nKet\u00e8lbey's popularity began to wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined; many of his post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the BBC. In 1949 he moved to the Isle of Wight, where he spent his retirement, and he died at home in obscurity. His work has been reappraised since his death; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes, Bells Across the Meadows was voted the 36th most popular tune of all time and the last night of the 2009 Proms season marked the fiftieth anniversary of Ket\u00e8lbey's death\u2014the first time his music had been included in the festival's finale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 9", "response": ["*1875 \u2013 Albert Ket\u00e8lbey, English pianist, composer, and conductor (d. 1959)"]}, {"page": "Isle of Wight", "response": ["* Composer Albert Ket\u00e8lbey"]}, {"page": "November 26", "response": ["*1959 \u2013 Albert Ket\u00e8lbey, English pianist, composer, and conductor (b. 1875)"]}, {"page": "The Proms", "response": ["* Albert Ket\u00e8lbey (50th anniversary of his death)"]}, {"page": "1959 in music", "response": ["*November 26\u00a0\u2013 Albert Ket\u00e8lbey, composer, conductor and pianist, 84"]}, {"page": "1927 in music", "response": ["*Albert Ket\u00e8lbey \u2013 By the Blue Hawaiian Waters"]}, {"page": "1931 in music", "response": ["*Albert Ket\u00e8lbey \u2013 In the Mystic Land of Egypt"]}, {"page": "1921 in music", "response": ["*Albert Ket\u00e8lbey"]}, {"page": "1875 in music", "response": ["* August 9 \u2013 Albert Ket\u00e8lbey, composer (d. 1959)"]}, {"page": "Clifford Curzon", "response": ["Curzon was born in Islington, London, the younger son and second of three children of Michael Siegenberg, an antiques dealer, and his wife Constance Mary, n\u00e9e Young.Mann, William. \"Curzon, Sir Clifford Michael (1907\u20131982)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2011, retrieved 17 December 2015  The family name was changed to Curzon in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.Notice, The London Gazette, 14 August 1914, p. 6434 The household was musical: Mary Curzon was a talented amateur singer, Michael's sister was a professional singer, and his brother-in-law, the composer Albert Ket\u00e8lbey was a frequent visitor, and his performances of his music on the family piano were the young Curzon's earliest abiding musical memories.
