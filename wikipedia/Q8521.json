Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said, \"It's certainly much bolder and scarier than we imagined that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of not making this into a zombie movie, so we were constantly trying to figure out how not to make these dead people coming up look like zombies. A lot of it came down to their movement \u2013 they don't move fast, but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style.\" He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.", "| John RichardsonTim BurkeTim AlexanderNicolas Aithadi", "| Tim BurkeJohn RichardsonNicholas AithadiTim Alexander"]}, {"page": "77th Academy Awards", "response": ["** Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\u00a0\u2013 Roger Guyett, Tim Burke, John Richardson and Bill George"]}, {"page": "58th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \u2013 John Richardson, Roger Guyett, Tim Burke, Bill George and Karl Mooney"]}, {"page": "54th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Gladiator \u2013 John Nelson, Tim Burke, Rob Harvey and Neil Corbould"]}, {"page": "3rd Visual Effects Society Awards", "response": ["Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \u2013 Roger Guyett, Tim Burke, Theresa Corrao, Emma Norton"]}, {"page": "Harry Potter (film series)", "response": ["Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor of the series, said of the production on Harry Potter, \"It was this huge family; I think there were over 700 people working at Leavesden, an industry in itself.\" David Heyman said, \"When the first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't seem feasible until after we'd done the fourth.\" Nisha Parti, the production consultant on the first film, said that Heyman \"made the first film very much the way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it\".

Some of these include Rising Sun Pictures, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore, and Industrial Light & Magic. The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, respectively. Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series. Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films. Producer David Barron said that \"Harry Potter created the UK effects industry as we know it. On the first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the [US] west coast. But on the second, we took a leap of faith and gave much of what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones. They came up trumps.\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \"are bringing their work to UK effects companies. Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before Harry Potter.
