He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including Shakespeare. Very early on, though, he was championed by Whigs, and decried by Tories: with the regicide Edmund Ludlow he was claimed as an early Whig,Kevin Sharpe, Remapping Early Modern England: The Culture of Seventeenth-century Politics (2000), p. 7. while the High Tory Anglican minister Luke Milbourne lumped Milton in with other \"Agents of Darkness\" such as John Knox, George Buchanan, Richard Baxter, Algernon Sidney and John Locke.J. P. Kenyon, Revolution Principles (1977), p. 77. The political ideas of Milton, Locke, Sidney, and James Harrington strongly influenced the Radical Whigs, whose ideology in turn was central to the American Revolution.Robert Middlekauff (2005), The Great Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789, Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, , pp. 51, 136ff Modern scholars of Milton's life, politics, and work are known as Miltonists: \"his work is the subject of a very large amount of academic scholarship\"."]}, {"page": "Personal Rule", "response": ["Whig historians such as S.

The old chapel had been deeply unpopular amongst Protestants, and there had been much talk amongst London apprentices of pulling it down as an anti-Catholic gesture. Although modest externally, Henrietta Maria's chapel was much more elaborate inside and was opened in a particularly grand ceremony in 1636. This caused great alarm amongst many in the Protestant community. Henrietta Maria's religious activities appear to have focused on bringing a modern, 17th century European form of Catholicism to England. To some extent, it worked, with numerous conversions amongst Henrietta Maria's circle; historian Kevin Sharpe argues that there may have been up to 300,000 Catholics in England by the late 1630s\u00a0\u2013 they were certainly more open in court society.Purkiss, p. 34. Charles came under increasing criticism for his failure to act to stem the flow of high-profile conversions.White, p. 34. Henrietta Maria even gave a requiem mass in her private chapel for Father Richard Blount, S.J. upon his death in 1638. She also continued to act in Masque plays throughout the 1630s, which met with criticism from the more Puritan wing of English society.White, p. 28. In most of these masques she chose roles designed to advance ecumenism, Catholicism and the cult of Platonic love."]}, {"page": "Blair Worden", "response": ["* \"Andrew Marvell, Oliver Cromwell and the Horatian ode\", in Politics of Discourse: The literature and history of seventeenth-century England, ed.

Halliday, Eleanor Hubbard and Scott Sowerby, eds., Revolutionising politics: Culture and conflict in England, 1620\u201360, (Manchester, 2021), p. xvi. Unlike previous scholars who had seen the Civil Wars of the 1640s as stemming from the growth of ideological opposition to the Stuart monarchs over the previous half-century, the revisionists argued that an ideological consensus had prevailed at least until the early 1620s.  This consensus, in their view, was unsettled in the late 1620s and afterwards by religious disputes and by the crown's fiscal problems.  The revisionist school sought to counter interpretations of the English Civil Wars that had been advanced by historians influenced by Marxist and Whiggish models of historical development.  Kishlansky advanced his interpretation in an article in 1977 in The Journal of Modern HistoryMark Kishlansky, \"The Emergence of Adversary Politics in the Long Parliament,\" Journal of Modern History, vol. 49 (1977), pp. 617\u201340. and in two books, The Rise of the New Model Army (1979) and Parliamentary Selection (1986)."]}, {"page": "Kevin J.
