McCall's first signings were strikers Barry Conlon, from Mansfield Town, and Peter Thorne, from Norwich City, both on free transfers, on 2 July 2007. No more players were signed by the time City played their first pre-season friendly away at Harrogate Town on 16 July 2007. However, there were eight trialists in the team which won 1\u20130. The only goal of the game was a header from David Wetherall. Two days later, City were defeated 2\u20131 by Conference side Farsley Celtic, before a 2\u20130 victory against North Ferriby United. Scott Phelan, who had played all three of the pre-season games during a trial, became McCall's third signing on 24 July from Everton. The same day, City drew 1\u20131 with Burnley in their only home pre-season friendly open to fans, with a goal from Paul Evans. McCall signed full back Darren Williams, from Hartlepool United, Kyle Nix on a monthly contract, and Nathan Joynes on loan from Barnsley but released three other trialists. Joynes had been the third loan signing from Barnsley, following Paul Heckingbottom, who had played for Bradford in the 2003\u201304 season, and Thomas Harban. The following two friendlies both ended in defeat; first 1\u20130 to York City, then 2\u20131 to Blackpool in a private practice match, with another goal from Evans. Evans completed his transfer the following day, to be followed by Alex Rhodes, who had been on trial from Brentford, and Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu on loan from Gillingham, the following week.", "|align=\"left\"|17||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Thomas Harban", "|Thomas Harban"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Thomas Harban||||2007||6||0||"]}, {"page": "Harban, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Harban"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["|Thomas Harban"]}]}}
