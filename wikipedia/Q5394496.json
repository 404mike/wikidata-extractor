He pushed for the establishment of \"The Academy\" that brought through a series of young players to augment a side that could not be improved with the limited finances available. Two of the signings he did manage to make were those of John Dick and Malcolm Allison. Other players of the day included John Bond, Dave Sexton, Jimmy Andrews and Frank O'Farrell (later swapped for Eddie Lewis) and Tommy Moroney all part of an original \"Cafe Cassettari\" club started by Fenton as a result of the restrictive budget. Longstanding custodian in goal was Ernie Gregory.", "Fenton introduced continental ideas to the team, revamping training methods and taking inspiration from higher ranked teams, and even inspiring some. Fenton had been impressed greatly by the all-conquering Hungarians of the 1950s led by Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, and the Casseteri program and development of the academy were at the core. Ernie Gregory said (of the 1950s diet), \"We'd usually eaten fish or chicken and toast before then, but Dr. Thomas advised us all to eat steak and rice two hours before kick-off. All the other clubs copied us after that.\" However, not all the changes were strictly down to Fenton; Musgrove attributed much of the training regime to Allison, going so far as to state that once the players were at the club (signed by Fenton) they were pretty much Allison's property. As well as being a student of the game himself, Fenton encouraged all players to take coaching badges and many of his former players went on to coaching and managing roles after they retired. The Academy also involved, beyond the routine training and development of the youth and squad, actual tactical discussions between the players."]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Ernie Gregory"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Newham", "response": ["*Ernie Gregory, footballer"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 in English football", "response": ["*21 January 2012: Ernie Gregory, 90, former West Ham United goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "John Charles (footballer, born 1944)", "response": ["Playing for local side, West Ham boys, Charles was spotted by former West Ham United goalkeeper and scout, Ernie Gregory who recommended him to chief scout Wally St Pier.

Charles made his debut for the first team in May 1963 against Blackburn Rovers.

Nevertheless, playing most of his games alongside Bobby Moore, he made 142 appearances for West Ham in all competitions scoring two goals; one a League Cup game against Grimsby Town, the other the single West Ham goal in a famous Manchester United 6\u20131 victory at Upton Park in which Manchester United won the 1966-67 Football League trophy. From the autumn of 1969 until spring 1970 injury restricted Charles to only five games. He left West Ham in the summer of 1971.
