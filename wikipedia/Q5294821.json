In his prolific output as a historian, McCormick was attracted to controversial topics on which verifiable evidence was scarce. He wrote on the Hellfire Club, Jack the Ripper, the Cambridge Apostles and rather extensively about spies. He wrote histories of the Russian, Chinese, Japanese, British, and Israeli secret services, and biographies of Sir Maurice Oldfield and Ian Fleming.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Franklin", "response": ["Franklin is known to have occasionally attended the Hellfire Club's meetings during 1758 as a non-member during his time in England.

Le Queux claimed to have seen a manuscript in French written by Rasputin stating that Jack the Ripper was an insane Russian doctor named Alexander Pedachenko, an agent of the Okhrana (the Secret Police of Imperial Russia), whose aim in committing the murders was to discredit Scotland Yard. He was supposedly assisted by two accomplices: \"Levitski\" and a tailoress called Winberg.Le Queux, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 197 and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 103 However, there is no hard evidence that Pedachenko ever existed, and many parts of the story as recounted by Le Queux fall apart when examined closely.Begg, p. 309 For example, one of the sources named in the manuscript was a London-based Russian journalist called Nideroest, who was known for inventing sensational stories. Reviewers of Le Queux's book were aware of Nideroest's background, and unabashedly referred to him as an \"unscrupulous liar\".Quoted in Rumbelow, p. 198 Pedachenko was promoted as a suspect by Donald McCormick, who may have developed the story by adding his own inventions.Woods and Baddeley, p. 147", "left|60px|Walter SickertWalter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 \u2013 22 January 1942) was a German-born artist of British and Danish ancestry, who was first mentioned as a possible Ripper suspect in Donald McCormick's book The Identity of Jack the Ripper (1959).Knight, p. 250 He had a fascination with the Ripper murders, going so far as to stay in a room that was rumoured to have once had Jack the Ripper himself as a lodger, and depicted similar scenes in many of his paintings.
