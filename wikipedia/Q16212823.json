Although Rachel is older than Becky, it was Becky who entered the sport first: she persuaded Rachel to take up cycling, with the hope of the pair representing Wales in the team sprint at the 2014 Commonwealth Games - however these hopes were dashed when the event was removed from the Glasgow games' schedule.In 2013 James became a pilot for paracyclist Sophie Thornhill. The pair won a gold medal and set a new world record at the 2014 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Aguascalientes in the 1km time trial, on their debut in a major international event. They subsequently won a second gold in the tandem sprint.James represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, 2014 where she rode as pilot for former paralympic swimmer Rhiannon Henry. James reunited with Thornhill to compete in the 2014 British National Track Championships in September, where they won the mixed time trial and the 200 metre flying start time trial for blind and visually impaired riders. In addition James took a bronze medal in the team sprint alongside Helen Scott.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Rachel James"]}, {"page": "List of professional sports families", "response": ["| Rachel James, Becky James"]}, {"page": "British National Team Sprint Championships", "response": ["| 2012 || Abergavenny RCRachel James & Becky James  || Edinburgh RCEleanor Richardson & Lauryn Therin || Sport City VeloMegan Boyd & Jessica Crampton", "| 2013 || West Midlands RegionDannielle Khan & Jess Varnish || Eastern Region Katy Marchant & Victoria Williamson  || WalesEllie Coster & Rachel James ", "|2014  ||West Midlands RegionDannielle Khan & Jess Varnish || Eastern Region Katy Marchant & Victoria Williamson ||North West Region Rachel James & Helen Scott"]}, {"page": "Becky James", "response": [":1st Team sprint, British National Track Championships (with Rachel James)"]}, {"page": "2013 British National Track Championships", "response": ["|Rachel JamesAbergavenny RC|| ", "|Ellie CosterRachel Jamesrep.
