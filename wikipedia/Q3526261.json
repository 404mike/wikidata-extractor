In this season, he made 998 runs with just one innings of over 50 and a highest score of just 54: had he scored those two runs, he would have had the \"lowest highest score\" of any player completing 1,000 runs in an English season, a record at present held by his Worcestershire colleague, Dick Richardson."]}, {"page": "Dick Richardson", "response": ["Dick Richardson may refer to:", "*Dick Richardson (boxer) (1934\u20131999), Welsh heavyweight boxer", "*Dick Richardson (cricketer) (born 1934), English Test cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Dick Richardson (1958\u20131964) : D.
