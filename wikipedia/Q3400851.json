Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre reminded me of the horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music. \u2014Gwyneth Lewis"]}, {"page": "The Harvill Book of Twentieth-Century Poetry in English", "response": ["*Gwyneth Lewis"]}, {"page": "Next Generation poets (2004)", "response": ["*Gwyneth Lewis"]}, {"page": "Harkness Fellowship", "response": ["*Gwyneth Lewis, Welsh poet, the first National Poet for Wales "]}, {"page": "2005 in Wales", "response": ["*May - Gwyneth Lewis becomes the first National Poet for Wales."]}, {"page": "T.
