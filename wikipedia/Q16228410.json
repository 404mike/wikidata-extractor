It was in the 35th minute that Aisake \u00d3 hAilp\u00edn slipped the ball to Niall McCarthy, and he found the net from close range. Ben O'Connor tagged on a couple of frees, and the Rebels went in at the break with a 1-16 to 0-11 lead. The Saffrons narrowed the gap after the interval through Liam Watson and Neil McManus, however, they finished with fourteen men after Watson was sent off for a second booking, and Cork finished the job with a late salvo of scores to secure a 1-25 to 0-19 victory."]}]}}
