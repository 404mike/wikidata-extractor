He started that race outside the Top 10 and in the rain raced his way to the win on slicks.  At the Macau GP, Boyd walked away from an incredible crash - surviving after landing upside down and will be remembered as a great escape. He finished 12th in points overall. He was again nominated as BRDC Superstars and British MSA Race Elite Driver.\nIn 2010, financial constraints only allowed him to make two one-off races Hockenheimring for Sino Vision Racing in British F3, the second was the F3 Masters event at Zandvoort in which he started 24th on the grid and finished 8th in poor weather conditions.\nIn 2011 Boyd signed to race for Belardi Auto Racing in the U.S. F2000 National Championship in America. The deal came together days before the start of the season. He captured two wins, including one on the oval at the Milwaukee Mile, six podiums in total and finished third in the Championship points behind Petri Suvanto and Spencer Pigot.\nIn 2012, Boyd raced two event weekends for Belardi Auto Racing at Baltimore and Virginia International Raceway posting a third- and second-place finish at VIR.\nEarly years: Boyd starting karting in September 2001 in the cadet class (Zip kart) finishing in the Top 10 in his first year in the Northern Irish Championship.  Contested the Five Nations Championship at Nutts Corner finishing 5th.  His first championships were in 2004 winning the Ulster Championship at Nutts Corner, the Five Nations Championship (NC Plate Winner). He raced for Maranello in 2005 placing 1st in the Ulster Cup and second in the Northern Ireland Karting Association.  In 2006, he stepped up to Intrepid Karts and continued placing 1st and 2nd in Ulster championships.\nIn 2007, Boyd raced Formula Ford 1600 and won the Northern Irish FF1600 Championship. He was named Novice of the Year.  He set new track records on his first visits to Knockhill; Mondello Park; Brands Hatch during the Formula Ford Festival and at Silverstone during the Walter Hayes Trophy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul di Resta", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Alex Lynn Wayne Boyd"]}, {"page": "Antrim Grammar School", "response": ["*Wayne Boyd, winner of the European Le Mans series title in Portugal."]}, {"page": "Autosport BRDC Award", "response": ["| Wayne BoydAdam ChristodoulouJason MooreAaron SteeleDean Stoneman"]}, {"page": "British Formula Ford Championship", "response": ["|  Wayne Boyd"]}, {"page": "2008 Formula Renault seasons", "response": ["| Wayne Boyd"]}, {"page": "Tim Blanchard", "response": ["After winning the 2007 Australian Formula Ford Championship, Tim set his sights on conquering the British Formula Ford Championship, a series with a rich history, and a proving ground for many of the biggest names in motorsport.
