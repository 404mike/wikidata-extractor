He was for the first time his team's main goalkeeper, and played in 36 of the 42 league matches. Harrison moved on again in 1926, to Hartlepools United, who had just lost their goalkeeper Billy Cowell to First Division Derby County. Harrison remained with Hartlepools for two seasons, making 70 appearances in all competitions, before returning to Darlington for 1928\u201329. He began the season in the first team, and made 26 appearances in all competitions, the last of which was on 26 January 1929, a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Southport, but then lost his place to the 20-year-old future England international Harry Holdcroft.Tweddle, pp. 26, 103."]}]}}
