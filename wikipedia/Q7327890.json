Born to a noble Irish Catholic family at Balyna, he was the eldest son and heir of Ambrose More O'Ferrall, Lord of Laois and Prince of Annally. Educated at Stonyhurst College, More O'Ferrall entered politics young, becoming Member of Parliament for Kildare in 1830. In 1839, More O'Ferrall married Matilda, daughter of The 3rd Viscount Southwell, KP. After holding many senior roles, he was appointed Governor of Malta in 1847, a post he held until 1851. He was known to be a very honourable man and was made a Deputy lieutenant and a Justice of the Peace as well as a Member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. He stepped down as a Member of Parliament for Kildare in 1865. More O'Ferrall was widely respected, both in Ireland and Great Britain and has been widely praised for his achievements while Governor of Malta.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nationalist Party (Malta)", "response": ["The Nationalist Party's roots lie in the important language question of the late 19th century, when the colonial government in Malta tried to give the English language the importance Italian had held in schools, administration, and law courts. Fortunato Mizzi, who was a lawyer at the time, strongly opposed these reforms, and in 1880, he set up the \"Partito Anti-Riformista\" (Anti-Reform Party). He and his followers also wanted a better constitution for the island, as the one imposed at the time had been granted by governor Richard More O'Ferrall in 1849, and gave the Maltese little power. This was because the governor was to appoint more members to the council of government than there were to be elected by the voters."]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1847", "response": ["*#Richard More O'Ferrall, Governor of Malta (1847\u20131851)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1848", "response": ["*Malta \u2013 Richard More O'Ferrall, Governor of Malta (1847\u20131851)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1849", "response": ["* Malta \u2013 Richard More O'Ferrall, Governor of Malta (1847\u20131851)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1850", "response": ["* Malta \u2013 Richard More O'Ferrall, Governor of Malta (1847\u20131851)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1851", "response": ["*#Richard More O'Ferrall, Governor of Malta (1847\u20131851)"]}, {"page": "Dublin Metropolitan Police", "response": ["The DMP was modelled closely on London's Metropolitan Police. Not only were the uniforms of the two forces almost indistinguishable, especially after the helmet and Bath Star were adopted, but the two forces also had a similar organisational structure; rather than a Chief Constable, they were commanded by a Commissioner, who was not a police officer, but a magistrate holding a Commission of the Peace. The first Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police was John Lewis More O'Ferrall, brother of Richard More O'Ferrall. This was descended from the 18th century system of controlling parish constables, and was a sop to the public's fears about the danger of a standing police force under government control."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1837\u20131901)", "response": ["*Richard More O'Ferrall (1797\u20131880)"]}, {"page": "Stonyhurst College", "response": ["*Richard More O'Ferrall, Governor of Malta and Irish landownder."]}, {"page": "Financial Secretary to the Treasury", "response": ["|Richard More O'Ferrall"]}, {"page": "Second Melbourne ministry", "response": ["| Richard More O'Ferrall", "| Richard More O'Ferrall", "| Richard More O'Ferrall"]}, {"page": "List of governors of Malta", "response": ["|Richard More O'Ferrall || 60px || October 1847 || 13 May 1851"]}, {"page": "Kildare (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"| Richard More O'FerrallRe-elected in a by-election, on 26 May 1835, after being appointed a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury. ||rowspan=\"4\"| Whig", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Richard More O'FerrallBecame a Liberal on the formal creation of that party, soon after the 1859 general election. || Whig"]}, {"page": "Longford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Richard More O'Ferrall   "]}, {"page": "Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty", "response": ["* Richard More O'Ferrall, 1839\u20131841"]}, {"page": "History of County Kildare", "response": ["Kildare had ten parliamentary representatives in old Irish House of Commons \u2013 two for the Kildare county and two members each from Athy, Harristown, Kildare Borough and Naas.
