By the 1850s, with increasing competition and improvements in printing technology, pictorial designs were being incorporated in their advertising posters. The use of graphic artists began to influence the design of the pictorial poster. In 1905, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) commissioned Norman Wilkinson to produce artwork for a new landscape poster, advertising their rail and steam packet link to Ireland. In 1908, for the Great Northern Railway (GNR), John Hassall produced the famous image of the \"Jolly Fisherman\" with the \"Skegness is so Bracing\" slogan. Fortunino Matania painted a number of posters for the LMS. The development of this commercial art form throughout the first half of the twentieth century reflected the changes in British society, along with the changing styles of art, architecture, and fashion as well as changing patterns of holiday making. Terence Cuneo produced poster art for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, and British Railways."]}, {"page": "Claude Buckle", "response": ["This was Buckle's big break and during the pre-war years and after the war until 1963 Buckle produced some estimated 85 posters60 substantiated some unsigned or only initialled and 25 carriage prints for the railways making him one of the most prolific and recognized railway poster artists.He produced posters and carriage prints for GWR, LMS, SR & BR and artwork for LMR Railway Architecture series, LMR (A), LMR (D), S Region (A) He was a close friend of Terence Cuneo whom he met frequently on travels around England recording scenes for the railway posters that were a common site on railway station platforms and booking halls. Both artists have surviving artwork in the National Railway Museum. However, when the work started to dry up in 1963, following the Beeching Axe, Buckle relied more and more on the private market place to earn a living. On the advice of Cuneo, he moved away almost entirely from oil painting to concentrate his efforts on watercolours.", "In his appreciation to Claude Buckle, Terence Cuneo paid tribute to Buckle's style of painting. He pointed out that the living world gives enough inspiration on its own to produce a very high quality picture suitable for the living room.

Forty-five of his paintings were displayed at the Canadian War Records Exhibition at the Royal Academy, many of which featured horses in war.
