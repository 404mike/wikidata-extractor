The museum was run by the Bengal Natural History Society and many of his writings were published in that society's journal which he started and edited.\nInglis was born in Elgin, Scotland, the son of Archibald Inglis, a retired planter in India, who went to India at the age of 18. He gave up an office job in Inverness and moved to India where he worked initially at Roopachera Tea Estate in Hailekandi. He became interested in birds after a collector working for Allan Octavian Hume showed him a specimen of an oriole. He subsequently contacted E C Stuart Baker. In 1898 he became a indigo planter in Baghownie. During this time made studies of the birds, butterflies and dragonflies. In 1923 he took over as curator of the Darjeeling Natural History Museum. He then retired to Coonoor where he died in 1954.His ability to sketch and illustrate birds led to Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher inviting him to produce a series of articles on birds of importance to agriculture in India. These were published in the Agricultural Journal of India and were later revised and published as a book Birds of an Indian Garden in 1924.Inglis shot eight specimens of the pink-headed duck in Bihar from 1903, including the last known specimen collected in June 1935 from Baghownie.\n\n\t\t\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
