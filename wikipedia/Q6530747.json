The property was within walking distance of Cussons' factory. However Oaklands was severely damaged in The Blitz of 1941. The property lay in ruins for many years, and over 40 years later was pulled down to build a modern housing estate. Cussons factory at Kersal was demolished in the 2010s to await a similar fate. Tom Cussons later moved to Whitefriars, a house he owned next to the cricket club in Hale Manchester, and not far from the then small Manchester airport, called Ringway, converted after the war into civilian use. The Cussons family owned family homes around Cheshire. Leslie Cussons lived at Hale Bank Farm in Hale and owned an estate called Polebrook Hall. Marjorie Goodwin lived at Edgworth in Hale, a large Edwardian Mansion now demolished. Alex Cussons owned Parkdale in Bowdon, a large Victorian house now the home of the Vegetarian Society since 1968. Bits of land have been sold off over the years to bolster the Society's finances, and the grounds are now half the size of the original property. Nick Cussons owned Stretton Hall briefly and Natalie Shrigley-Feigl owned Kerfield House in Knutsford for about ten years."]}, {"page": "Gerard Bros.", "response": ["In 1955 the company was acquired by Cussons Sons & Co., chaired by Leslie Cussons makers of the famous brand Cussons Imperial Leather soap.
