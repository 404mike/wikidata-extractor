In 1998, he formed his own band Fracture along with Stockport player Tom Bennett, who was recovering from a severe break to his leg at the time. Both men decided to learn the guitar to brighten up the prolonged injury period, and a bassist and a drummer were added. After a period of nonperforming, Fracture were re-formed in April 2006 with Stockport's club doctor Steve Greenhough (keyboards and bass), David Prudhoe (lead guitar) and Keith Chadwick (drums) joining Rodger and Tom to complete the new line-up. They play regular concerts around the Greater Manchester area."]}, {"page": "List of Hamilton Academical F.C. players", "response": ["|Tom Bennett||||2005||1||0||"]}, {"page": "2001 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["Walsall faced Stoke City in their play-off semi-final with the first match of the two-legged tie taking place at the Britannia Stadium on 13 May 2001.  Both sides had numerous chances to score, with Walsall's Don Goodman missing at least three opportunities.  Stoke substitute Ben Petty who had come on as a substitute for Stoke was sent off in the 84th minute for a foul on Pedro Mat\u00edas, and the game ended goalless.  The second leg of the semi-final was played three days later at the Bescot Stadium in Walsall.  In the 31st minute, Stoke's Graham Kavanagh scored with a volley from a R\u00edkhar\u00f0ur Da\u00f0ason header.  Tom Bennett's inswinging corner was fumbled by Gavin Ward, the Stoke goalkeeper, and ended in the goal to level the scores.  Two minutes after half time, Mat\u00edas put Walsall ahead and three minutes later, a free kick from Dean Keates eluded Ward to make it 3\u20131.  Mat\u00edas scored his second of the match before a consolation goal from Peter Thorne ended the match 4\u20132 and Walsall progressed to the final.", "|MF ||4 ||Tom Bennett|| || "]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|23 June 1995|| Tom Bennett||align=\"center\"|Stockport County||align=\"center\"|\u00a375,000"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["|MF ||4 || Tom Bennett|| || "]}]}}
