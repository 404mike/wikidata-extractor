A further two names\u2014Christy Gibson and Jonas Anderson (singer)\u2014should be removed for lack of sources, leaving only Jeremy Spencer and Ricky Rodriguez. Their notability is linked to their membership in TFI, and they probably should be included. Perhaps the \"Leadership\" and \"Members\" groups could be combined into one \"People\" group: David Berg (founder) - Karen Zerby (current leader) - Ricky Rodriguez (ex-member) - Jeremy Spencer (member). -- Black Falcon (talk) 21:37, 26 March 2011 (UTC)", ":::::As the one would reverted back to inclusion of those names, I reconsidered and I now agree with you. Some of those names do not belong. When I wrote that \"they have self-identified\", I should have clarified. Some of them have. The entire Phoenix family were members of TFI and the biography of River Phoenix includes several paragraphs on his time in Venezuela in TFI and he said a bit about it. Joaquin Phoenix also said a bit about his time in several interviews. Rose McGowan also talked about her time in TFI in Italy in several interviews, as did Christopher Owens and Susan Cagle/Justice. Christy Gibson and Jonas Anderson have been very vocal of their membership and support of TFI in Thailand (and TFI promoted their involvement in TFI). Kerenina Sunny Halim was, in the past, very active in TFI. Anyway, I don't really care either way.

He moved to Thailand as a child with his family in August 1981. Shortly after arriving, his family moved to the North-Eastern region of Thailand (Issan) to engage in educational projects in rural areas. Jonas Anderson had an interest in music and singing from an early age. Growing up in Thailand he started picking up the language and learning Thai songs. When Jonas was in his teens his family moved down to Bangkok, and Jonas enrolled in a performing arts course in his late teens after which he formed a group with Christy Gibson and other friends performing for various social causes, especially drug awareness programs in schools and youth centers.", "Jonas Anderson's unlikely path to becoming a known lookthung or Thai country recording artist began when he and Christy Gibson were asked to sing a lookthung song for a community event. This experience sparked Jonas' interest in lookthung and he started to learn and perform more of this style of music.", "Jonas Anderson's first album was followed by three more albums under Wetee Thai after which he was signed by Sony Music Thailand where he released one more solo album and his first duet album with Christy Gibson. After that, he released a seventh album (his second duet album) under the Mangpong label. His eighth album is one that he and Gibson produced and released independently.
