He wound up making a career-high 43 appearances in the league, and started every match bar one after September, playing alongside Marvin Elliott in midfield.

After the season, new manager Steve Coppell offered Skuse a new extended contract until 2013, which he signed.

After some indifferent results, City went back to the top after a last-gasp winner from Steve Brooker, who was just returning from injury, in a 2\u20131 win over Norwich City. However a poor run ended City's chances of an automatic promotion place. On 4 May 2008, a 3\u20130 home win against Preston North End on the final day of the league season ensured a playoff place and a semi-final fixture against Crystal Palace. On 13 May 2008, a 4\u20132 aggregate win over Crystal Palace with goals from Lee Trundle and Michael McIndoe confirmed City's trip to Wembley, where they were beaten 1\u20130 by Hull City. At the end of the season, defender Bradley Orr and midfielder Marvin Elliott were both included in the PFA Team of the Year, while goalkeeper Adriano Basso was named the club's player of the season. Elliott was the club's young player of the season."]}]}}
