Having made an indifferent start to the 2019\u201320 League Two season, Colchester entered the play-offs for the first time with a 3\u20131 win at Leyton Orient on Boxing day. The team reached the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup, eliminating both Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur on penalties after holding both Premier League teams to 0\u20130 draws. In the quarter-finals they were beaten 3\u20130 by Manchester United at Old Trafford. The season ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England and the table was decided on points per game with Colchester in the play-offs in sixth-place. However the club announced that 16 players would be released at their end of their contracts, with chairman Robbie Cowling admitting that he \"would have been determined to re-sign\" Brandon Comley, Ryan Jackson, Frank Nouble and Luke Prosser in normal circumstances. Colchester lost out to Exeter City after extra-time in the play-off semi-finals and McGreal was subsequently dismissed by the club on 14 July 2020 as Cowling felt that \"significant changes are required that will be best served with a new head coach\". McGreal said he was \"deeply saddened\" with the decision to end his 11-year association with the club and that \"the memories of this season will live with me forever\"."]}, {"page": "Essex derby", "response": ["The largest Essex derby victory was recorded on 10 November 2020, when Colchester beat Southend 6\u20131 at the Community Stadium.
