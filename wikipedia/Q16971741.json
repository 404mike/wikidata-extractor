They married in 1942 and settled in Montreal, before moving to London in 1947. The couple had two children, son Christopher Green and daughter Linda Plentl (n\u00e9e Green). The family lived in a fifth-floor flat in Baker Street, London, although with Green's numerous affairs and self-obsession, including taking luxury holidays and spending Christmas often on his own, his children defined it as \"highly dysfunctional.\" The Greens separated in 1961 and filed for divorce in March 1975 after Green started an affair with Gwen Claremont, the sister of an earlier lover, Pat. Later that year, Claire married Upstairs, Downstairs actor David Langton. After separation from his wife, Green's drinking became more compulsive, while his affairs continued even during the height of his fame presenting Opportunity Knocks. Journalist Noel Botham approached Green to expose him, but Green countered with a lawsuit threat. Eventually the two became good friends."]}, {"page": "John Bindon", "response": ["In 1968, he met Vicki Hodge, a baronet's daughter turned model and actress, who introduced him to British aristocracy. However, he had been previously invited to the Caribbean island resort of Mustique, where Bindon claimed to have had sex with Princess Margaret. A biographer of the Princess, Noel Botham, firmly believed Bindon had an affair with her.  Returning to Mustique for a second time in 1969, he took girlfriend Hodge with him. The princess later publicly denied meeting Bindon (despite pictures of them next to one another) and was reportedly unimpressed to hear stories of their sexual encounters in the press. During this time Bindon gained the nickname \"Big John\", due to the reported size of his penis. Apparently demonstrated on multiple occasions over decades, when inebriated, Bindon was able to hang five half-pint beer glasses from his manhood."]}, {"page": "Collect call", "response": ["While Mother's Day has the highest number of phone calls, the most collect calls are made on Father's Day.Gogoi, Pallavi. \"Father's Unspectacular Day.\" BusinessWeek. 14 June 2005.The Book of Useless Information, Noel Botham, 2002, Perigee, , 500 Mostly Useless Facts djtech.netUseless Facts - 102 Best Facts You Can Impress Your Friends laughbreak.com"]}, {"page": "Suggs", "response": ["Suggs is a member of the \"Useless Information Society\" (founded 1995), a society of journalists, writers and entertainers which focuses on esoteric information and has released books such as The Book of Useless Information.
