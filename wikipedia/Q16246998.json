The sport of cricket had acquired most of its modern features by this time and roundarm bowling was firmly established.\nMore county cricket clubs began to become established during this period, following the establishment of Sussex County Cricket Club in 1839. Clubs were formally established in Nottinghamshire, Kent and Surrey, all of which remain first-class counties today. These teams competed against each other and other teams, although the County Championship was not formally established until 1890.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1841 and 1850 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spenceley", "response": ["*J. Spenceley, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Lewis (English cricketer)", "response": ["Lewis made his first-class debut for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture of 1837 at Lord's, where he batted last in the Gentlemen's first-innings and was dismissed for a duck by Sam Redgate, while in their second-innings he was absent hurt. Lewis later made a second first-class appearance nearly a decade later in 1846 for the Surrey Club against the Marylebone Cricket Club at The Oval. Opening the batting with J. Spenceley in the Surrey Club's first-innings, he was dismissed for 4 runs, stumped by William Nicholson off the bowling of William Hillyer. He followed this up in the Marylebone Cricket Club's first-innings by taking four wickets, the most by any Surrey Club bowler in that innings. Batting at number eight in their second-innings, Lewis was dismissed for a duck by Hillyer."]}]}}
