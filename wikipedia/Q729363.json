Judge met Harry Williams (Henry James Williams, 23 September 1873 \u2013 21 February 1924) in Oldbury, Worcestershire at the Malt Shovel public house, where Williams's brother Ben was the licensee. Williams was severely disabled, having fallen down cellar steps as a child and badly broken both legs. He had developed a talent for writing verse and songs, and played the piano and mandolin, often in public.  Judge and Williams began a long-term writing partnership that resulted in 32 music hall songs published by Bert Feldman.  Many of the songs were composed by Williams and Judge at Williams's home, The Plough Inn (later renamed The Tipperary Inn), in Balsall Common.  Because Judge could not read or write music, Williams taught them to Judge by ear. \"The World's Most Famous Marching Song\", TipperaryWarSong.co.uk.

The song was originally written and performed as a sentimental ballad, to be enjoyed by Irish expatriates living in London.

They were all 95% my work, as Mr Williams made only slight alterations to the work he wrote down from my singing the compositions. He would write it down on music-lined paper and play it back, then I'd work on the music a little more ...

In a 1933 interview, he added: \"The words and music of the song were written in the Newmarket Tavern, Corporation Street, Stalybridge on 31st January 1912, during my engagement at the Grand Theatre after a bet had been made that a song could not be written and sung the next evening ...   Harry was very good to me and used to assist me financially, and I made a promise to him that if I ever wrote a song and published it, I would put his name on the copies and share the proceeds with him. Not only did I generously fulfil that promise, but I placed his name with mine on many more of my own published contributions.
