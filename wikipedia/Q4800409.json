A prolific playwright, he authored more 300 works.Swinson was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, to Hugh Swinson and Lilla Fisher Swinson. He attended St Albans School. He enlisted in the Rifle Brigade in 1939 and in 1940 was commissioned into the Worcestershire Regiment. In the Far East, he fought at the 1944 Battle of Kohima as a staff captain with the British 5th Brigade, which commanded the 7th Battalion of his regiment. The diaries he kept during the battle are now lodged in the Imperial War Museum. He served until 1946, with postings in Malaya, Burma, Assam and India during World War II.  In 1949, he subsequently became a writer and producer at the BBC where he produced a number of programmes for Richard Attenborough.In 1966, Swinson wrote and published \"Kohima,\" an account of the Battle of Kohima which was fought from April to June 1944 and in which he was a participant. The preface states that Field Marshal William Slim directed Swinson to ensure that Kohima and Imphal are described as twin battles fought under Slim's 14th Army. This Swinson does. Ultimately, however, the book focuses on the experience of the British 2nd Infantry Division. The book is a good adjunct to Slim's \"Defeat Into Victory\" and Masters' \"Road Past Mandalay.\"\nSwinson was the author of Scotch on the Rocks (1963 and 2005), which told the true story of the wartime wreck of the SS Politician, on which Compton Mackenzie's novel Whisky Galore (1947) \u2013 and the Ealing Comedy of the same title \u2013 were based.\nHe died in Spain while on vacation, aged 55. He was survived by his wife, Joyce Budgen, and their three children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Albans School, Hertfordshire", "response": ["* Arthur Swinson (c. 1915\u201370), army officer, writer, playwright and historian"]}, {"page": "SS Politician", "response": ["After leaving the River Mersey, Politician travelled through the Irish Sea, made her way past the Isle of Man, through the North Channel that separates Britain and Ireland, past Islay then to the west of the Skerryvore lighthouse and into the Sea of the Hebrides. In the vicinity of Eriskay, Politician ran aground on rocks at about 7:40\u00a0am on 4 February in bad weather and poor visibility. Sources differ on where Politician was grounded. The Canmore database run by the Historic Environment Scotland puts the event half way along the eastern cost of Eriskay; Roger Hutchinson's book on the story of the ship states it was on the rocks of Ru Melvick, a rock outcrop at the southernmost point of South Uist; the Merseyside Maritime Museum considers it was on \"submerged rocks on the northern side of the island of Eriskay\"; and Arthur Swinson's 1963 history places it just north of Calvay, a small uninhabited island at the north end of Eriskay. Eriskay is ; the population recorded on the island in the 1931 census was 420.", "The writer Compton Mackenzie was a resident of Barra from 1933, and was aware of the events surrounding Politician. In 1947 he published a fictionalised humorous account under the title Whisky Galore; he set the story on two islands, Great Todday and Little Todday and developed the theme of \"the right of small communities to self-determination in the face of larger, frequently ignorant, interfering forces\", according to the historian Gavin Wallace. The book sold several million copies and was reprinted several times. Two factual books deal with the events surrounding Politician; in 1963 Arthur Swinson published Scotch on the Rocks: The True Story Behind Whisky Galore, which contained a foreword by Mackenzie, and in 1990 Roger Hutchinson wrote Polly: The True Story Behind Whisky Galore."]}, {"page": "Swinson", "response": ["* Arthur Swinson (c. 1915\u20131970), British Army officer"]}, {"page": "Micheline Patton", "response": ["| colspan=3 style=\"text-align:left;padding:0.1em 1em;font-style:italic;border: solid thin;\" | Written by Arthur Swinsonin which television brings you great moments of history with the news coverage of today.", "| colspan=2                  | Arthur Swinson"]}, {"page": "Arthur Horace Swinson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Swinson"]}]}}
