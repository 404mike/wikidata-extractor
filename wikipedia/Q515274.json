Although Close does extensive research and preparation for her roles, she also relies less on the technicality of a performance saying, \"Good acting I think is like being a magician, in that you make people believe; because it's only when they believe that they are moved. And I want people to get emotionally involved. I think technique is important but it isn't everything. You can have a great technical actor who'll leave people cold. That's not my idea of great acting. As audience, I don't want to be aware of acting.\" Longtime collaborator and playwright Christopher Hampton describes Close an actress who can very easily convey \"a sense of strength and intelligence.\" Hampton worked on Sunset Boulevard and the stage production of Dangerous Liaisons, later casting Close in the movie version of the latter production. \"Glenn is often described as having a glacial or distant quality about her, but in person she's the absolute opposite: warm and intimate,\" says actor Iain Glen, who co-starred with her in the 2002 stage production of A Streetcar Named Desire. \"She was able to bring strength to the role, she was able to completely access that vulnerability.
