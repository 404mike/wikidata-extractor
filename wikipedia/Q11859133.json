When Eva was 15 years old, her father died and she left school to begin her career as a social worker. In 1911 she married her cousin, the lawyer Valentin Rosenfeld (1886\u20131970). Valentin studied in Vienna and attended the lectures held by Freud. Through her husband, Eva first became aware of psychoanalysis. When they married, they settled in Vienna.\nEva and Valentin Rosenfeld had four children, but three of them died in young age. The loss of children \u2014 especially the 15-year-old daughter Rosemarie in 1927 \u2014 shadowed the later life of Eva Rosenfeld.\nAfter World War I Rosenfeld opened a school for girls. Eva Rosenfeld and Anna Freud became close friends sometime in 1924 through Siegfried Bernfeld. In 1927 Rosenfeld and Anna Freud founded (together with Dorothy Burlingham) a school in Vienna where most of the students underwent psychoanalysis, usually with Anna Freud.\nEva Rosenfeld was a patient of Sigmund Freud from 1929 until 1931. After her divorce she returned to Berlin in 1931 and assisted Ernst Simmel at a psychoanalytical sanatorium. Her formal education as a psychoanalyst was completed in Berlin. In 1936 she moved to England, where she worked the rest of her life as a psychotherapist and supervising analyst; her analysands include Benjamin B. Rubinstein, Nina Coltart and Maria W. Piers. She was further analyzed by Melanie Klein in 1938\u20131941 and this damaged her relations with the Freud family.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Psychoanalytical Society", "response": ["|Eva Rosenfeld", "File:Eva-Rosenfeld.jpg|Eva Rosenfeld"]}, {"page": "Rosenfeld", "response": ["* Eva Rosenfeld (1892\u20131977), German-British psychoanalyst"]}, {"page": "Nina Coltart", "response": ["Coltart attended Sherborne School for Girls and from there went to Somerville College, Oxford, where she read English and Modern Languages.

Rubinstein", "response": ["Benjamin B. Rubinstein was born in the Jewish community of Helsinki, and he attended school both in his home town and in Copenhagen. His native language was Swedish. In Helsinki University, he studied first history and philosophy, but after having read Totem and Taboo by Sigmund Freud, he changed to the Faculty of Medicine in order to become a psychoanalyst. He also worked as a research assistant to Ragnar Granit. Rubinstein attained the degree of Licentiate in Medicine in 1936, and studied neurology and psychiatry in the United Kingdom in 1937\u20131939.

She began her studies in psychoanalysis under Eva Rosenfeld, at Rosenfeld\u2013Burlingham School, and there became acquainted with Erik Erikson and his work.Stein, p. 2-3.
