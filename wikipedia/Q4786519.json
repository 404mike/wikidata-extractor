Smith left most of the management of the estate to its staff, which generated \u00a34,500 of income across its core  holding, of which \u00a33,000 came from the quickly diminishing coal mines and ironstone workings leased on the former farmlands to the Monkland Iron and Steel Co.Frances Groome's Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, 1882-4 An 1872 government award of \u00a32,000 for his compass research allowed him to replace the worst houses on the estate with new homes, today known as Compass Cottages in Anniesland Road.
