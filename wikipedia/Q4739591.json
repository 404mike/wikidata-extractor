He worked as an elevator operator to make up for the costs his scholarships did not cover. He made his debut as a concert accompanist for tenor Sydney Woodward, and from there was discovered by tenor Roland Hayes, with whom he toured from 1918 to 1923, including a performance at Buckingham Palace in 1921.  While in England, he attended Trinity College for advanced training, where he received education in composition from Amanda Aldridge.  In addition to piano and vocal arrangements, he performed string arrangements with cellist Beatrice Harrison at Wigmore Hall."]}, {"page": "Ruth Reese", "response": ["After her concert debut in 1952, Reese moved to England and studied Amanda Aldridge. Her European debut was at the Salle Gaveau in Paris in 1953. Though classically-trained, she gained her reputation from performing Spirituals, Gospel music and the Blues with their roots in African-American tradition. Touring Europe, she performed both on stage and on the airwaves in Czechoslovakia, England, France, Israel, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and throughout Scandinavia. She first came to Norway in 1956, where she drew attention for the color of her skin, often billed as a negersangerinne (negro songstress). At the time, Norwegian society viewed itself as homogeneously white and had not recognized its indigenous or national minority populations. Reese found similar situations to those she had experienced in the United States, when she was denied lodging numerous times. She persevered, making a name for herself and fell in love. In 1960, she permanently settled in Oslo, Norway and two years later married the bookstore owner Paul Shetelig."]}, {"page": "Luranah Aldridge", "response": ["Luranah went to school with her sister Amanda Aldridge at a convent in Ghent, Belgium.

Give an audition to Mademoiselle Luranah Aldridge.\" Harris featured Luranah in a Grand Wagner Orchestral Concert at St. James\u2019s Hall in 1893.
