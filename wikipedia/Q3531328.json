Much of the cash from this \u00a35.2m windfall went into paying off Robert Maxwell. Maxwell was replaced first by Brian Fearn and then by Lionel Pickering, who made his fortune through the founding and running of a free newspaper, and brought majority shareholdings and invested \u00a312m in the form of a loan. Derby went from being financially stricken to one of the richest clubs outside the top flight. Derby twice broke its transfer record in the space of a month when in March 1992 they signed Paul Kitson for \u00a31.3m from Leicester City (Phil Gee being one of two players going in the opposite direction) and then Tommy Johnson for Notts County ten days later. Paul Simpson also came in from big money (\u00a3800k from Oxford United) as did Marco Gabbiadini (\u00a31.3m from Sunderland) and even Bobby Davison (who had left for Leeds United three years earlier), returned for a spell on loan and reached a century of goals for Derby, only the 7th player and most recent to do so, when he netted in a 2\u20132 draw with Newcastle United. Despite such attacking prowess, and the setting of a new club record for 12 away wins in a season, Derby could only finish 3rd in the 1991\u201392 Second Division and missed out on automatic promotion by 2 points. As a result, Derby entered the Football League playoffs for the first time since they had been introduced in 1987. Facing off against fellow big spenders Blackburn Rovers, Derby fell at the semi final stage as a 2\u20131 win at The Baseball Ground wasn't enough to overcome a 4\u20132 defeat at Ewood Park in the first leg and they crashed out 4\u20135 on aggregate and missed out on the opportunity to be a part of the inaugural Premier League, instead spending the 1992\u201393 season in the renamed Division One.", "He was replaced by his assistant Roy McFarland (who became the only man to manage the club permanently in two separate spells) who steered the club's to a second playoff campaign. After overcoming Millwall 5\u20131 on aggregate in the semifinal legs, and surviving a pitch invasion in the 3\u20131 win at the New Den, Derby came up against local rivals Leicester City at Wembley. Despite taking the lead through Tommy Johnson, Derby lost 2\u20131 after a double from Steve Walsh and missed out on promotion yet again. Derby had built a side which seemed to be consistently achieving less than the sum of its parts, with Gary Charles, a former England international, Craig Short, Paul Williams, Mark Pembridge, Paul Kitson and Tommy Johnson all keen to test themselves at a higher level. Several of these players left during the 1994\u201395 season, Kitson joining Newcastle United for \u00a32.25m, Charles and Johnson moving to Aston Villa for a combined \u00a32.9m and Pembridge moving to Sheffield Wednesday. The side was also weakened when goalkeeper Martin Taylor, an ever-present the previous season and touted for a place in the England squad, broke his leg in a 1\u20130 defeat at Southend United and was out of action for the next 29 months. With chairman Lionel Pickering's increased frustration at no return on his investment, the purse strings were tightened and McFarland was unable to buy suitable replacements, instead blooding youth products such as Dean Sturridge, Russell Hoult and Lee Carsley to fill the gaps created by the departures. In the event Derby could only record a 9th-place finish and McFarland, in the knowledge his contract was not going to be renewed, said his goodbye's in the penultimate match of the season, a 2\u20131 home defeat at Southend United, ending a 28-year association with the club, broken only by a two-year spell as player-manager at Bradford City."]}, {"page": "Steve Cherry", "response": ["County adapted well to the Second Division, winning their first four games of the 1990\u201391 season and going on a run of nine games unbeaten in December.
