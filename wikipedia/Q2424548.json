Returning to England, he won the competition in 1782 for the design of Skerton Bridge in Lancaster.  After moving to Lancaster he worked on local buildings, received commissions for further bridges, and designed country houses in Scotland.  In 1786 Harrison was asked to design new buildings within the grounds of Lancaster and Chester castles, projects that occupied him, together with other works, until 1815.  On both sites he created accommodation for prisoners, law courts, and a shire hall, while working on various other public buildings, gentlemen's clubs, churches, houses, and monuments elsewhere.  His final major commission was for the design of Grosvenor Bridge in Chester.\nSome of Harrison's designs, including his buildings at Lancaster Castle, were Gothic in style, but most were Neoclassical, particularly those at Chester Castle.  He was regarded at the time, and since, as a major influence in the emergence of the Greek Revival in British architecture.  A bridge he designed at the start of his career, and another towards the end of his career, incorporated innovative features; Skerton Bridge was the first substantial bridge in England to have a flat roadway, and the Grosvenor Bridge was the longest single-arched masonry bridge in the world at the time of its construction.  Many of Harrison's structures have survived, most of them now designated by English Heritage as listed buildings.  Despite his work being nationally admired he spent his entire career in northwest England, visiting London only occasionally; most of his buildings were in Lancashire, Cheshire, and the nearby counties.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Magdalen College, Oxford", "response": ["Ultimately, the idea of integrating the New Building into a new quad was abandoned, and the ends of the building were finally completed in 1824 with two returns designed by Thomas Harrison.

It is used for accommodation for undergraduates and fellows, including historically Edward Gibbon and C. S. Lewis, and also houses the wine cellar."]}, {"page": "Lancaster Castle", "response": ["Prison reformer John Howard (1726\u20131790) visited Lancaster in 1776 and noted the conditions in the prison. His efforts to instigate reform led to prisoners in gaols throughout the country being separated by gender and category of their crime. Improvements were also made to sanitation; in the 18th\u00a0century more people died from gaol fever than by hanging. In the last two decades of the century, around \u00a330,000 was spent rebuilding Lancaster's county gaol. Architect Thomas Harrison was commissioned to complete the work. Under his auspices, the Gaoler's House was built in 1788 in a Gothic style. Separate prisons were built for men and women. The Shire Hall and Crown Court were complete by 1798. Harrison had to divide his time between Lancaster and designing and building Chester Castle's Shire Hall and Courts; work at Lancaster slowed, partly because of dwindling funds due to war with France, and Harrison was released from the work as the Justices of the Peace felt it was taking too long. The artist Robert Freebairn was paid \u00a3500 to paint twelve watercolours of the work in 1800 to be presented to the Duke of Lancaster, King George\u00a0III.

Waterloo Bridge, over the River Thames in London (1811\u20131817), with its nine equal arches and perfectly flat roadway, is thought to have been influenced by Thomas Harrison's design of Skerton Bridge over the River Lune in Lancaster. In Leeds he was commissioned to build two stone bridges, one over the River Aire and a second smaller structure over the Leeds & Liverpool Canal, to the west side of the town centre and upstream from Leeds Bridge. The main instigator of this scheme was mill owner Benjamin Gott, who had properties on both sides of the waterways and wanted an easier route between them. The larger bridge was described in 1934 (Parsons' Directory) as 'a beautiful structure, consisting of an elliptical arch of one hundred feet span'. The bridge, initially known as Waterloo Bridge, was soon renamed Wellington Bridge. Rennie's later efforts in this line also show that he was a skilful architect, endowed with a keen sense of beauty of design. Waterloo Bridge was considered his masterpiece and was the most prestigious bridge project in England, described as 'perhaps the finest large masonry bridge ever built in this or any other country'. The Italian sculptor Canova called it \u2018the noblest bridge in the world\u2019 and said that \u2018it is worth going to England solely"]}, {"page": "Chester Castle", "response": ["Chester Castle is in the city of Chester, Cheshire, England.

Thomas Harrison was commissioned to design a new prison. This was completed in 1792 and praised as one of the best constructed prisons in the country. Harrison then went on to rebuild the medieval Shire Hall in neoclassical style. He also built two new wings, one to act as barracks, the other as an armoury, and designed a massive new entrance to the castle site, styled the Propylaeum. The buildings, which were all in neoclassical style, were built between 1788 and 1822.
