The club's history would have ended at this point, had it not been for an unexpected twist. North Staffordshire Church League champions Cobridge Church were accepted into the North Staffordshire Federation League, still a very minor league. Joint-secretaries Millward and E.C.Brundrett had very big ambitions however. In 1907, they sought permission from the Football Association to change the club's name to Port Vale and bought the old club's ground (the Athletic Ground). To signify their roots they renamed their reserve side to Cobridge Church. Port Vale were now playing teams such as Leek United, Newchapel United and Ashwood Villa. However their fifth-placed finish encouraged the club to apply, successfully, for membership of the North Staffordshire & District League. Financial pressures soon affected the lowly club, and in December 1908, former Vale player Sam Bennion led a buy-out consortium. Former players Adrian Copes, Bert Eardley and Harry Croxton were re-signed and the future looked bright."]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Harry Croxton"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Harry Croxton"]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Chelsea F.C. season", "response": ["In the Second Qualifying Round of the FA Cup, the Blues travelled to the south of the capital to play fellow Londoners Southern United of the Southern League Division Two at Brown's Ground in Nunhead, Camberwell.
