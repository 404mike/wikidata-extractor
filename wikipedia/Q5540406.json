This personage had a Norse name (Ketill) but also an Irish nickname Find \"the Fair\" or \"the White\", which might match Finn mac Cumhall. But Ketill's father must have had some Norse name also, certainly not Cumall, and the proposal was thus rejected by George Henderson."]}, {"page": "Boobrie", "response": ["Boobrie may derive from , meaning cow giver or cow bestowing. Edward Dwelly, a Scottish lexicographer, lists tarbh-boidhre as \"Monster, demon\" and \"God capable of changing himself into many forms\"; tarbh-aoidhre is given as a northern counties variation. The simpler component of tarbh as a single word is defined by Dwelly as \"bull.\" Transcribers of the tale have used several differing spellings of the second component, some even adopting  inconsistent variations throughout their own renditions. George Henderson for instance, a folklorist and Celtic scholar, used five alternatives: bo'eithre; boidhre; bo-oibhre; eithre; and fhaire. Spelling variations employed by other writers include aoidhre; baoighre; baoidhre; boidhre; eighre; and oire."]}, {"page": "John Francis Campbell", "response": ["The Celtic Dragon Myth was published posthumously in 1911.

In both cases, the offer was withdrawn owing to Carmichael's unhappiness with the publisher's plans, and his determination to see the collection through the press on his own terms and according to his own design. Much of the final editing was carried out after Carmichael's retirement from the Inland Revenue in December 1897, with the help of a team of assistants including his daughter Ella Carmichael and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s George Henderson (1866\u20131912), who gave the work its title, and Kenneth MacLeod (1871\u20131955). The initial letters, adapted from early medieval insular manuscripts and engraved stones, were illustrated by Carmichael's wife Mary Frances Macbean (1838\u20131928). The book itself, dedicated to Mary Frances, was published in two volumes in October 1900, under the auspices of Walter Biggar Blaikie (1847\u20131928) in a limited edition of 300 copies, costing 3 guineas a copy.

He was made Legum Doctor at Aberdeen University in 1901 and received his pension in 1905. During the last two decades of his life, Macbain was one of the leading figures in a Gaelic intellectual circle which met in Inverness and Edinburgh. The group included both older members, such as Alexander Nicolson, Alexander Carmichael and Donald Mackinnon, and a younger generation which included Father Allan MacDonald, William J.
