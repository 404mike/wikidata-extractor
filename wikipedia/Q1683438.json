The sleeve was designed by Cosby/Fletcher/Forbes, a design collaboration between graphic designers Theo Crosby, Alan Fletcher, and Colin Forbes, with additional design work from Haig Adishian. Music journalist and band biographer Chris Welch later wrote: \"Although the sleeve wasn't graced with the kind of elaborate cover art that Roger Dean would introduce on the 1971 Fragile album, the ... cover was most effective\". The front cover of the United States and Canada pressings features a photograph of the band at an architectural centre in Fulham, taken by American photographer David Gahr. It was also included in the album's 2003 remastered release. The gatefold includes a group photograph and mid-gig shots taken by Nicky Wright at Parliament Hill Fields in north London.
