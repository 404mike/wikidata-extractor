In Corbyn's submission to the Forde inquiry, submitted jointly with eight other colleagues, he was reported to have accused officials of sabotage and said their diversion of funds could constitute fraud. The diverted funds refer to the \"Bespoke Materials Service\" (sometimes referred to as the 'Ergon House Project'), which represented 1.2 per cent of Labour's total election spend and was focused towards certain Labour-held seats rather than offensive targets. BMS was apparently not disclosed to Corbyn's office. Officials have maintained their targeting was due to legitimate fears Labour would lose seats, based on its poor polling position at the start of the campaign, and have pointed out that three of the seats supported by BMS were less than 500 votes away from being lost to the Conservatives. The 2017 campaigns chief, Patrick Heneghan also stated that Corbyn's office had demanded he divert funds towards a list of Labour-held seats, some with majorities of over 10,000, to help MPs were considered allies of Corbyn, including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett. Heneghan said the use of funds in BMS was legal, as it had been authorised by the General Secretary, and stated it had been kept from Corbyn's office because staffers believed they were \"in a bind\" and \"felt it was pointless to try and discuss this sensibly with Jeremy's staff\""]}, {"page": "Socialist Campaign Group", "response": ["|Ian Lavery"]}, {"page": "National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)", "response": ["* 2002: Ian Lavery"]}, {"page": "Tom Watson (Labour politician)", "response": ["In June 2017, Ian Lavery replaced Watson as Labour Party Chair."]}, {"page": "Denis Murphy (British politician)", "response": ["On 5 November 2009, Murphy announced his decision to stand down at the next general election.
