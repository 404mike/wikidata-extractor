(A Scottish Society of Painters in Water Colour was founded in 1878, now known as the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour.) These societies provided annual exhibitions and buyer referrals for many artists. They also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates, particularly between advocates of traditional (\"transparent\") watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with body color or gouache (\"opaque\" watercolor). The late Georgian and Victorian periods produced the zenith of the British watercolor, among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper, due to artists Turner, Varley, Cotman, David Cox, Peter de Wint, William Henry Hunt, John Frederick Lewis, Myles Birket Foster, Frederick Walker, Thomas Collier, Arthur Melville and many others. In particular, the graceful, lapidary, and atmospheric watercolors (\"genre paintings\") by Richard Parkes Bonington created an international fad for watercolor painting, especially in England and France in the 1820s."]}, {"page": "Kew Bridge", "response": ["Myles Birket Foster (1825\u20131899) painted Kew Bridge from Strand on the Green."]}, {"page": "White Hart", "response": ["The White Hart, the village pub in Witley, is mostly Elizabethan and is said to stand on the site of an Anglo-Saxon inn.
