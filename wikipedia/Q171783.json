He participated in 37 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 8 May 1977. He scored no championship points.\nKeegan won the 1976 British Formula 3 Championship, which propelled him into Formula One.  After seasons with Hesketh and Surtees, neither of them particularly competitive teams, he won the Aurora Formula One Championship in 1979. A return to the Formula One World Championship with RAM driving their Williams FW07B yielded little in the way of results, as did a few races with March.\nAfter Formula One, Keegan raced in the United States in CART, and also in endurance racing.  After his retirement, he pursued business interests and also worked as a racing instructor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Williams Grand Prix Engineering", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Rupert Keegan Kevin Cogan Geoff Lees"]}, {"page": "Renault in Formula One", "response": ["The team's poor qualifying form returned in Italy, as Jabouille qualified 20th.
