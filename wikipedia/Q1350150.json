He was the brother of musicians Eden Kane and Clive Sarstedt. \nAlthough his music was classified as pop, it generally encompassed ballads derived from traditional folk music rather than traditional rock and roll. He was best known for writing and performing the song \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\", which topped the UK Singles Chart in 1969. Set to a \"faux European waltz tune\" and described as \"a romantic novel in song\", it won an Ivor Novello Award. The record remained Sarstedt's biggest hit. He had one more hit single and one hit album but despite numerous releases never had chart success again.  \nHe continued to tour throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, mainly in 1960s revival-type shows, until his retirement in 2010 due to ill health.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 8", "response": ["*  2017   \u2013 Peter Sarstedt, Indian-British singer-songwriter and guitarist (b. 1941)"]}, {"page": "1941", "response": ["** Peter Sarstedt, English singer, songwriter (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "Sophia Loren", "response": ["Loren has recorded more than two dozen songs throughout her career, including a best-selling album of comedic songs with Peter Sellers; reportedly, she had to fend off his romantic advances.
