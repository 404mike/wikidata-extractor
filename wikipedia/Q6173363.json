He was  Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces from 2004 to 2020 and among the cases over which he presided was that of \"Marine A\". Blackett was criticised by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for sentencing Sgt Alexander Blackman RM to a life sentence for murder, as he failed to give the board the option to pass a lesser sentence of manslaughter. Alexander Blackman's murder conviction was eventually quashed in 2017 after a successful appeal.In a previous high-profile case, Blackett also presided over the retrial in 2013 of SAS Sgt Danny Nightingale. Sgt Nightingale's first trial in 2012 resulted in a conviction for possession of an illegal weapon and a sentence of 18 months' detention in the Military Corrective Training Centre. After a public campaign and a debate in the House of Commons in which several MPs called for Nightingale's release, the conviction resulting from Nightingale's guilty plea was quashed by the Court Martials Appeal Court and a retrial was ordered. Blackett stated that he would like to impose an immediate custodial sentence. His hands were tied, however, by the previous ruling from the Court Martials Appeal Court that Sgt Nightingale should not be held in custody any longer.He was the chief disciplinary officer at the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and conducted an investigation into the Bloodgate scandal, and is the President of the RFU for the 2020\u201321 season. He was a Senior Circuit Judge from 2005 until his retirement in 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces", "response": ["*1 November 2004: Jeff Blackett"]}, {"page": "Blackett", "response": ["*Jeff Blackett (born 1955), British Royal Navy office and judge"]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Blackett", "response": ["#redirectJeff Blackett"]}, {"page": "Danny Nightingale (British Army soldier)", "response": ["*R v Sgt Danny Nightingale - Sentencing remarks of HHJ Jeff Blackett, Judge Advocate General (25 July 2013)."]}, {"page": "2011 Helmand Province killing", "response": ["The verdict (8 November 2013) and sentence (6 December 2013) were both delivered at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading the panel at a Court Martial) was Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett. The verdict carried with it a mandatory life sentence, so it was only in the judge advocate's and Court Martial board's power to decide on the minimum sentence once the board had found Blackman guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, upheld the life sentence, but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.", "*R -v- Sergeant Alexander Wayne Blackman, sentencing remarks of HHJ Jeff Blackett, Judge Advocate General, 6 December 2013"]}]}}
