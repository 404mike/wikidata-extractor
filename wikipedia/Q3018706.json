Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support. As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven years old. The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers, which Chaplin remembered as \"a forlorn existence\". He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.", "Modern Times was announced by Chaplin as \"a satire on certain phases of our industrial life\". Featuring the Tramp and Goddard as they endure the Great Depression, it took ten and a half months to film. Chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals. Like its predecessor, Modern Times employed sound effects but almost no speaking. Chaplin's performance of a gibberish song did, however, give the Tramp a voice for the only time on film. After recording the music, Chaplin released Modern Times in February 1936. It was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism, a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite Chaplin's attempts to downplay the issue. The film earned less at the box-office than his previous features and received mixed reviews, as some viewers disliked the politicising. Today, Modern Times is seen by the British Film Institute as one of Chaplin's \"great features\", while David Robinson says it shows the filmmaker at \"his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy\".", "As a filmmaker, Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century. He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin \"changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar\" and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama. He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it. Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama A Woman of Paris (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film The Marriage Circle (1924) and thus played a part in the development of \"sophisticated comedy\". According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were \"rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft\". Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called Chaplin \"a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended\"), Jacques Tati (\"Without him I would never have made a film\"), Ren\u00e9 Clair (\"He inspired practically every filmmaker\"), Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (\"My religion is cinema. I believe in Charlie Chaplin\u2026\"), Michael Powell, Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica, and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as \"the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old.\" Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray said about Chaplin \"If there is any name which can be said to symbolize cinema\u2014it is Charlie Chaplin\u2026 I am sure Chaplin's name will survive even if the cinema ceases to exist as a medium of artistic expression. Chaplin is truly immortal.\" French auteur Jean Renoir's favourite filmmaker was Chaplin."]}, {"page": "Graham Chapman", "response": ["In 1976, Chapman began writing a pirate film, Yellowbeard (1983), which came out of conversations between Chapman and Moon while in Los Angeles. Moon had always wanted to play Long John Silver, so Chapman began to write a script for him. Moon died in 1978 and the work stalled, eventually being rewritten by McKenna, then by Peter Cook. The film, which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate, also featured appearances from Cook, Marty Feldman, Cleese, Idle, Spike Milligan and Cheech & Chong. It marked the last appearance of Feldman, who suffered a fatal heart attack in December 1982. The project was fraught with financial difficulties and at times there was not enough money to pay the crew. It was released to mixed reviews. David Robinson, reviewing the film in The Times, said  that \"the Monty Python style of comic anarchy requires more than scatology, rude words and funny faces\"."]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier", "response": ["Olivier's dermatomyositis meant he spent the last three months of 1974 in hospital, and he spent early 1975 slowly recovering and regaining his strength. When strong enough, he was contacted by the director John Schlesinger, who offered him the role of a Nazi torturer in the 1976 film Marathon Man. Olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of his eyes, in a role that the critic David Robinson, writing for The Times, thought was \"strongly played\", adding that Olivier was \"always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both\". Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won the Golden Globe of the same category."]}, {"page": "John Huston", "response": ["Huston had been planning to film Herman Melville's Moby-Dick for the previous ten years, and originally thought the starring role of Captain Ahab would be an excellent part for his father, Walter Huston. After his father died in 1950, Huston chose Gregory Peck to play the role. The movie was filmed over a three-year period on location in Ireland, where Huston was living. The fishing village of New Bedford, Massachusetts was recreated along the waterfront; the sailing ship in the film was fully constructed to be seaworthy; and three 100-foot whales were built out of steel, wood, and plastic. But the film failed at the box office. Critics such as David Robinson suggested that the movie lacked the \"mysticism of the book\" and thereby \"loses its significance.\""]}, {"page": "The General (1926 film)", "response": ["In 1963, Keaton said, \"I was more proud of that picture than any I ever made. Because I took an actual happening out of the...history books, and I told the story in detail too\". With changing tastes and a reevaluation of his works, later audiences and critics agree with him, and it is now considered a major classic of the silent era. David Robinson wrote, \"Every shot has the authenticity and the unassumingly correct composition of a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph.\" Raymond Durgnat wrote, \"Perhaps The General is the most beautiful [film], with its spare, grey photography, its eye for the racy, lunging lines of the great locomotives, with their prow-like cowcatchers, with its beautifully sustained movement.\"Wakeman. 1987. p. 528. Writing for Jacobin in 2015, Eileen Jones called the film a \"comic masterpiece\" which nevertheless promoted the Lost Cause of the Confederacy."]}, {"page": "Chaplin (film)", "response": ["The film was adapted by William Boyd, Bryan Forbes and William Goldman from Chaplin's 1964 book My Autobiography and the 1985 book Chaplin: His Life and Art by film critic David Robinson. Associate producer Diana Hawkins got a story credit. The original music score was composed by John Barry. The film received mixed reviews and grossed merely $9.5 million against its $31 million budget; Downey's titular performance, however, garnered critical acclaim and won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor along with nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama."]}, {"page": "W. C. Fields", "response": ["* David Robinson, The Great Funnies: A History of Film Comedy (1969) E.P. Dutton"]}, {"page": "Licence to Kill", "response": ["David Robinson, writing in The Times, observed that Licence to Kill \"will probably neither disappoint nor surprise the great, faithful audience\", but bemoaned the fact that \"over the years the plots have become less ambitious\". Robinson thought that Dalton's Bond \"has more class\" than the previous Bonds and was \"a warmer personality\". Iain Johnstone of The Sunday Times pointed out that \"any vestiges of the gentleman spy\u00a0... by Ian Fleming\" have now gone, and in its place is a Bond that is \"remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the Batman film\" that was released at the same time as Licence to Kill."]}, {"page": "Never Say Never Again", "response": ["Never Say Never Again was broadly welcomed and praised by the critics: Ian Christie, writing in the Daily Express, said that Never Say Never Again was \"one of the better Bonds\", finding the film \"superbly witty and entertaining,\u00a0... the dialogue is crisp and the fight scenes imaginative\". Christie also thought that \"Connery has lost none of his charm and, if anything, is more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero\". David Robinson, writing in The Times also concentrated on Connery, saying that: \"Connery\u00a0... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way\". For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo \"very nearly make it all worthwhile.\" The reviewer for Time Out summed up Never Say Never Again saying \"The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff.\""]}]}}
