South Durham Steel and Iron, was a large horizontally integrated company that operated mines, mills, and shipyards. Its management used traditional accounting methods with the goal of minimizing production costs, and thus raising its profitability. By contrast one of its competitors, Cargo Fleet Iron introduced mass production milling techniques through the construction of modern plants. Cargo Fleet set high production goals and developed an innovative but complicated accounting system to measure and report all costs throughout the production process. However, problems in obtaining coal supplies and the failure to meet the firm's production goals forced Cargo Fleet to drop its aggressive system and return to the sort of approach South Durham Steel was using.Gordon Boyce, \"Corporate Strategy and Accounting Systems,\" Business History, 34#1 (1992): 42-65."]}, {"page": "Emile Garcke", "response": ["One of the special features of this work was the additional eight page long glossary of terms, while other authors in those days embedded the meaning of term within their  text.Trevor Boyns, J.
