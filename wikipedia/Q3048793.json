This is of course well known, and the master of the house does in reality place a Christmas gift secretly in each stocking; but the giggling girls in the morning, when bringing down their presents, affect to say that Santiclaus visited and filled the stockings in the night. From what region of the earth or air this benevolent Santiclaus takes flight I have not been able to ascertain ...\" Lees received several responses, linking 'Santiclaus' with the continental traditions of St Nicholas and 'Petit Jesus' (Christkind), but no-one mentioned Father Christmas and no-one was correctly able to identify the American source."]}, {"page": "Rowan", "response": ["British folklorists of the Victorian era reported the folk belief in apotropaic powers of the rowan-tree, in particular in the warding off of witches. Such a report is given by Edwin Lees (1856) for the Wyre Forest in the English West Midlands. Sir James Frazer (1890) reported such a tradition in Scotland, where the tree was often planted near a gate or front door."]}, {"page": "Worcestershire Beacon", "response": ["The hill itself appears to mark the northern terminal of the Shire Ditch, or Red Earl's Dyke, which runs north and south of the British Camp along the ridge of the hills. It was created in 1287 by Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, following a boundary dispute with Thomas de Cantilupe, the Bishop of Hereford.Palmer, R. 1992, The Folklore of Hereford and Worcester. Oxford University Press Recent research has shown that the Shire Ditch might actually be much older. Indeed, there is some evidence that it may have started life as a prehistoric trackway running from Worcestershire Beacon to Midsummer Hillfort. The hill is also the site of two Bronze Age burials. In 1849 two urns containing bones and ashes were uncovered by Private Harkiss whilst conducting work for the Ordnance Survey and documented by Edwin Lees, a local antiquarian."]}, {"page": "Malvern Chase", "response": ["In his book The Forest and Chase of Malvern, Edwin Lees describes the origins of the chase. \"Nothing is stated with certainty as to the ownership of the Forest or Wilderness of Malvern before the reign of Edward I, who granted it as Royal property to Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, and it was henceforth called a Chace. The second Gilbert de Clare married Maude, daughter of John de Burgh, when the Chaces of Malvern and Cors, with the Castle and Manor of Hanley, were assigned her as a dower; but the Earl being killed in the Scottish war, and having no children by Maude, these possessions went after his death to his sisters, as his heirs, and the eldest, who married Hugh le Despencer the younger, brought them with other possessions into the Despencer family, where they remained till in the third generation, then passing by marriage to Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, a renowned general in the reign of Henry V who was killed in the French wars.\"", "*Edwin Lees: 1887, The Forest and Chace of Malvern, Its Ancient and Present State: With Notices of the Most Remarkable Old Trees, Remaining Within Its Confines"]}, {"page": "Henry Harris Lines", "response": ["Henry Harris moved to Worcester in 1832 because of the cholera epidemic that was spreading across the Midlands. He lived at Bath Road but also retained his address in Birmingham until 1838. From that year onwards, his addresses remained in the Worcester area.  Worcester was previously seen as lacking in intellectual activity, as highlighted by Henry Harris' school friend Edwin Lees who originally trained as a printer and stationer but later turned to the sciences and natural history. Geoffrey Potter notes in Henry's biography that Lees, upon visiting Worcester in 1828, noticed 'Worcester's lack of the societies and institutions necessary for a man of refined intellect', which 'was remedied by a Mr. Jackson, who delivered a course of lectures on the subject of Natural Philosophy'. From this emerged the Worcester Literary and Scientific Society, which became the exemplar for other societies within the region, such as the Worcestershire Natural Society and the Worcester Archaeological Club. Henry Harris thrived in this hub of activity and it was here that his work as both archaeologist and artist excelled."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (K\u2013L)", "response": ["* Lees \u2013 Edwin Lees (1800\u20131887)"]}, {"page": "Lees (surname)", "response": ["*Edwin Lees (1800\u20131887), British botanist and antiquarian", "*Walter Edwin Lees (1887\u20131957), American aviator"]}, {"page": "Newland Oak", "response": ["As one of the largest oaks in the country the tree was the subject of some fame.
