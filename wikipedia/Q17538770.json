They commented that \"[m]useums claim they create a new copyright when making a faithful reproduction of a 2D artwork by photography or scanning, but it is doubtful that the law supports this\". They argued that the fees inhibit the dissemination of knowledge, the very purpose of public museums and galleries, and so \"pose a serious threat to art history\". They therefore advised the UK's national museums \"to follow the example of a growing number of international museums (such as the Netherlands' Rijksmuseum) and provide open access to images of publicly owned, out-of-copyright paintings, prints and drawings so that they are free for the public to reproduce\"."]}, {"page": "Goodison", "response": ["*Sir Nicholas Goodison (1934\u20132021), British businessman"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Nicholas Goodison, Ian Mikardo, Jane Reed, George Younger"]}, {"page": "National Life Stories", "response": ["As well as the Leaders of National Life project, which was funded from NLS\u2019s core funds, NLS sought to undertake \u2018Special Collections\u2019 with funding sought from professional associations, industry and other institutions - this is the model which has been used ever since.
