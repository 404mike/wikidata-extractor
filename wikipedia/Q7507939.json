He played as a wing half.\nWallington was born in the Small Heath district of Birmingham, and lived in St Andrew's Road, adjacent to Birmingham F.C.'s St Andrew's ground. A pupil of Ada Road School, Wallington played for the Birmingham Schools representative team that reached the final of the English Schools' Football Association Trophy in 1923. He signed for Birmingham from Wolseley Motors in 1928, and played for their junior teams in a variety of positions before making his debut in the First Division on 30 April 1932, the penultimate game of the 1931\u201332 season, in a 4\u20130 home win against Chelsea. Though his performance received a favourable report \u2013 the Birmingham Mail described his excellent ball control and felt that \"one saw enough of him to justify the conclusion that he understands the defensive duties of a wing half-back equally well\" \u2013 Birmingham's next game was Wallington's last for the club.\nThe following year he joined Bristol Rovers, where he played 94 league games in four seasons and helped them win the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1935. He went on to Worcester City, where he also acted as manager during the 1937\u201338 season, and finished his career at Cradley Heath St Luke's.Wallington died in his native Birmingham in December 1989 at the age of 81.", "link_mentions": {}}}
