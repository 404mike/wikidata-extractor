It was defeated by Storm's mutant weather-controlling ability and Bishop. Nimrod had a supporting role in \"One Man's Worth\" [Parts 1 & 2]. Nimrod, under Master Mold's orders, acts as a warden to Trevor Fitzroy and Bantam in Charles Xavier's assassination in 1959. After disguising itself as its intended target, Nimrod fights Bishop, Shard, and alternate versions of Wolverine and Storm but is once again defeated. Although Fitzroy and Bantam are successful, Nimrod is tasked by Master Mold to eliminate the four time-traveling mutants then Master Mold's own reluctant mutant allies. While Fitzroy and Bantam defect, Nimrod presumably eliminates Shard and Forge but not other three time-traveling mutants. Returning to 1959, Nimrod again disguises itself as a friend (voiced by Kay Tremblay) to get close to Xavier. However, Nimrod's fight with the three time-traveling mutants doesn't end in its favor.
