She wrote some 200\u00a0books, pamphlets and articles throughout her life. During 1850 and 1852, she was struggling with her self-definition and the expectations of an upper-class marriage from her family. As she sorted out her thoughts, she wrote Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth. This was an 829-page, three-volume work, which Nightingale had printed privately in 1860, but which until recently was never published in its entirety. An effort to correct this was made with a 2008 publication by Wilfrid Laurier University, as volume\u00a011 Privately printed by Nightingale in 1860. of a 16\u00a0volume project, the Collected Works of Florence Nightingale. The best known of these essays, called \"Cassandra\", was previously published by Ray Strachey in 1928. Strachey included it in The Cause, a history of the women's movement. Apparently, the writing served its original purpose of sorting out thoughts; Nightingale left soon after to train at the Institute for deaconesses at Kaiserswerth."]}, {"page": "1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*Ray Strachey, aged 31, Independent, Brentford and Isleworth, MiddlesexHallam, David J.A., ibid, pp 73\u201390"]}, {"page": "Logan Pearsall Smith", "response": ["Smith's sister Alys was the first wife of philosopher Bertrand Russell.

Although it brought little by way of immediate progress on the parliamentary front, its significance in the general suffrage campaign was considerable. By embracing activism, the constitutionalists' tactics become closer to those of the WSPU, at least in relation to the latter's non-violent activities. In her 1988 study of the suffrage campaign, Tickner observes that \"modest and uncertain as it was by subsequent standards, [the march] established the precedent of large-scale processions, carefully ordered and publicised, accompanied by banners, bands and the colours of the participant societies.\" The feminist politician Ray Strachey wrote:"]}, {"page": "1940 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 July \u2013 Ray Strachey, feminist campaigner (born 1887)"]}, {"page": "1887 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 June \u2013 Ray Strachey, born Rachel Costelloe, feminist campaigner (died 1940)"]}, {"page": "Mary Berenson", "response": ["Mary had two daughters with Frank Costelloe; Ray Strachey and Karin Stephen.

She became a teacher at Allenswood for a few years, but then met the feminist Emily Davies, who encouraged her to join the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS).  Strachey's mother, Jane, was a friend of Millicent Fawcett and was already active in the NUWSS, so it was relatively easy for Pippa to become a committee member, then in 1907 to become secretary of the organisation.  One of her first tasks was the organisation of the \"Mud March\"; this was deemed so successful, that she thereafter planned all the group's demonstrations. Pippa's and her sister-in-law, Ray Strachey were both involved in the suffrage movement.", "Strachey supported World War I, but was unable to work in field hospitals due to her health.  Instead, she worked with Ray Strachey, with a particular focus on finding women good work opportunities.  As a result, they founded the Women's Service Bureau, with Pippa as its unpaid secretary.  She continued after the war as it became the London Society for Women's Service and, eventually, the Fawcett Society.  Under her leadership, the organisation created a substantial library and purchased a building to use as a social club and headquarters."]}, {"page": "Ray Costelloe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ray Strachey"]}, {"page": "Blanche Athena Clough", "response": ["After Clough's retirement in 1923, she devoted her time to gardening, bird-watching, and volunteering for the London and National Society for Women\u2019s Service which became the Fawcett Society in 1953.
