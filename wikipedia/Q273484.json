Walden Media hired screenwriter John Hodge in October 2005 to adapt the story for the big screen.  The mythology of Cooper's book was considered to be the plot, and Hodge was tasked to interpret the book into events that could be portrayed in a film.  The story, which took place in the 1960s and 1970s in the book, was rewritten to be contemporary. Vikings were included in the film, based on a reference in the book to an old Viking boat which the protagonist discovers. Hodge rewrote the protagonist Will Stanton, portrayed by Alexander Ludwig, to be 14 instead of 11. The screenwriter chose this age, considering 11 to be more of a child's age, and 14 to be an age of transition.  Stanton was also written to be American so he would be established as more of an outsider, culturally alien to the story's English setting.  Hodge also wrote new subplots for Ludwig's character in the film, including sibling conflicts, a crush on a young woman (Amelia Warner), and alienation at school.  The script also features the inclusion of many action sequences.  The character of The Walker, portrayed by Jonathan Jackson, was also rewritten as a younger person with a new story arc about the loss of his soul.  However, Jackson's character was ultimately removed from the film's theatrical cut.Jonathan Jackson does not appear in the film's theatrical cut.  Susan Cooper was reportedly not happy with the adaptation of her book.In a 2016 interview (Archived from the original), Cooper describes the above comment in this Wikipedia article as \"a considerable understatement\"."]}, {"page": "Don Quixote (2000 film)", "response": ["The film was produced by Dyson Lovell, with Robert Halmi Sr. and John Lithgow as executive producers, and cinematography by David Connell.
