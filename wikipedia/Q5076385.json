Toole, John Hollingshead, Mary Anderson, Lydia Thompson and Herbert Beerbohm Tree, as well as performing in his own companies.  He toured for some years as the title character in F. C. Burnand's The Colonel and played many military men.\nCollette continued acting in London and in the British provinces until 1907, a career of nearly four decades, but he is probably best remembered today for the presence of his musical play Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata on the bill with the historic 1875 premiere of Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1924 in music", "response": ["*February 10 \u2013 Charles Collette, composer and actor (b. 1842)"]}, {"page": "1842 in music", "response": ["*July 29 \u2013 Charles Collette, actor and composer (d. 1924)"]}, {"page": "Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1858)", "response": ["In early 1882 Hawtrey played Jack Merryweather in The Marble Arch, which starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree.
