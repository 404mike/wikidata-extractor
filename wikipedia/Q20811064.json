A gay artist friend married her which allowed her to work legally and she, later, obtained a job at The Redfern Gallery. In 1948, with the financial support of Arthur Jeffress, an American banker she had met at a party, Brausen opened the Hanover Gallery in St. George Street off Hanover Square in central London with a solo exhibition of works by Graham Sutherland. From 1946 until its closure in 1973, the Hanover Gallery was among the most influential galleries in Europe. Brausen had bought a number of Francis Bacon early works, including Painting (1946), and he held his first one-man show at the Hanover in November 1947. Brausen became Alberto Giacometti's principal dealer in London, selling more than seventy of his works over the lifetime of the Gallery.

Behrens was visiting the empty gallery for the first time one evening when Erica Brausen, who ran the gallery, mentioned in passing that she would be closing up the next day. Behrens was \"immediately fascinated\" by Bacon's work, and offered to help. Jeffress \"detested\" Bacon and that was his main reason for backing out of the Hanover Gallery.
