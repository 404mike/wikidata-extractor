On 26 February 1969, he was a member of the Mansfield team that made national headlines with a shock 3\u20130 win against West Ham United in the fifth round of the FA Cup.Boam's consistent performances for Mansfield eventually caught the eye of bigger clubs, and in June 1971 he was sold to Middlesbrough for \u00a350,000. He was immediately placed in Boro's starting lineup, and was named team captain ahead of the 1973\u201374 season, when Middlesbrough won the Second Division title. In eight years at Ayresome Park, Boam played nearly 400 games for Middlesbrough, and was rarely out of the side.His association with Middlesbrough came to an end in August 1979, when he was sold to North East rivals Newcastle United for \u00a3170,000. In July 1981, Boam returned to Mansfield, where he was named player-manager. However, a back injury restricted his playing role to a handful of appearances, and as manager he failed to get the expected results, finishing fifth from bottom of Division Four in his only full season in charge. He was sacked as manager in January 1983, and finished his career with a short spell at Hartlepool United.He found relative fame being mentioned in the Half Man Half Biscuit song 'Bladderwrack Allowance'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Charlton took advice from Celtic manager Jock Stein, who allowed him to sign right-sided midfielder Bobby Murdoch on a free transfer. Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a championship winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton had to work with some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["|1972|| Jim Platt and  Stuart Boam", "|1979|| Stuart Boam"]}, {"page": "Mansfield Town F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Stuart Boam"]}, {"page": "Billy Ayre", "response": ["The summer of 1982 saw Ayre move again, this time to Mansfield Town, then managed by Stuart Boam.

Despite starting his Boro career as a striker he was known as a central defender. In the 1970\u201371 season Maddren established himself in the Boro defence. In 1971, Middlesbrough manager Stan Anderson bought Mansfield Town central defender Stuart Boam to form a defensive partnership with Maddren. In 1973, after repeated failures to gain promotion to the old First Division, Anderson left Middlesbrough and was replaced by World Cup winner Jack Charlton."]}]}}
