While in Kurdistan he heavily interviewed and collected the experiences of anti-ISIS fighters belonging to the Women's Protection Units and People's Protection Units. Describing the environment in Rojava as \u201ca feeling, a spirit, the life and soul of a revolution\u201d, he began centering much of his journalism and music around Kurdish issues. He recorded these experiences in his first book Serkeftin: A Narrative of the Rojava Revolution and published by Zero Books, the largest imprint of John Hunt Publishing.  The Morning Star gave a positive review, while Publishers Weekly gave a mixed review describing the book as a \"valuable and revealing account of the nascent institutions of Syria\u2019s Kurdish warriors\" but criticised it for its overuse of \"uneven, utilitarian prose\" and described him as having a \"rose-coloured\" outlook. Cartier later expanded his ideas on Kurdish nationalism within his second book, a self-published collection of essays that were originally published by TheRegion and titled Berxwedan: Writings on the Kurdish Freedom Movement. He was the U.S. West Asia Policy editor for TheRegion.org before the project's closure after the death of its lead editor."]}]}}
