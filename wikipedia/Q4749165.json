She was one of the first female industrialists in Britain.\nBorn in Sketty, Swansea, Dillwyn was a member of a prominent family. Her father was industrialist and politician Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, her older sister was lepidopterist Mary De la Beche Nicholl, her paternal uncle was botanist and photographer John Dillwyn Llewelyn, her paternal aunt was photographer Mary Dillwyn, and her paternal first cousin was astronomer and photographer Thereza Dillwyn Llewelyn. Dillwyn's paternal grandfather was the businessman, naturalist, and politician Lewis Weston Dillwyn, while her maternal grandfather was geologist and palaeontologist Henry De la Beche. Dillwyn's paternal great-grandfather was the American abolitionist William Dillwyn, who had migrated to Great Britain. \nFrom the 1870s to the early 1890s, Dillwyn, wrote 6 novels. Her themes included feminism, social reform, and a favorable view of the Rebecca Riots (1839-1843) in response to unfair taxation. Following her father's death in 1892, Dillwyn inherited his spelter works at Llansamlet and his debts. She personally managed the industry, and by 1899 had fully repaid her father's debts. In 1902, she turned her business into a registered company. She joined the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, and campaigned for women's suffrage.\nDillwyn never married, but considered herself married to \"her wife\" Olive Talbot.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of novelists by nationality", "response": ["*Amy Dillwyn (1845\u20131935)"]}, {"page": "1884 in literature", "response": ["*Amy Dillwyn \u2013 Jill"]}, {"page": "1845 in literature", "response": ["*May 16 \u2013 Amy Dillwyn, Welsh novelist (died 1935)"]}, {"page": "Henry De la Beche", "response": ["Daughter Elizabeth (1819\u20131866) known as Bessie, married Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, a scientist, industrialist and long-serving Liberal MP for Swansea who campaigned for disestablishment in Wales on 16 August 1838.

His father had been sent to Swansea by his father William, to take over the management of the Cambrian Pottery, and lived at Sketty Hall. He was educated at Kilvert's Academy in Bath but, following his father's election to Parliament as one of the two members for Glamorgan in 1832 he and chose to follow a business career by taking over the management of Cambrian Pottery, rather than enter Oriel College, Oxford as had been intended. His father was a friend of the geologist Henry De la Beche and Dillwyn and De la Beche carried out experiments on china clays and granites with the aim of improving the production of earthenware. On 16 March 1838, Dillwyn married de la Beche's daughter Elizabeth and, with his wife's artistic guidance, the pottery produced a range of beautiful Etruscan ware which is today a collector's item.

The Dillwyn Llewelyn family was also related through marriage to William Henry Fox Talbot, who claimed to discover photography in 1839. She was ahead of her time for her interest in new revolutionary technology: Most of the photographs taken by Dillwyn are small calotypes from the 1840s and 1850s, making her the first female photographer in Wales. Unlike her male counterparts, Dillwyn preferred a small camera which, as it only needed short exposure times, provided her with the opportunity to take more spontaneous photographs that captured the intimate moments of her family and friends in Victorian life. Because of this, her work appeared as more natural than those of other photographers of the period. Her interest in photography appears to have ended in 1857 when she married Reverend Montague Earle Welby.Iwan Meical Jones, \"Susan Franklen's photograph album\", Early Swansea Photography.
