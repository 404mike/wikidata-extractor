The death of Paul Warwick in 1991 led to a chicane being added at the entry to the corner. Before Warwick's death, the bend had a reputation as a \"racers' corner\" because it demanded a driver's full commitment and total courage. Originally it was a fifth gear, off camber right-hand bend at the end of a downhill straight called Hilltop. Deep kerbing on the inside of the corner combined with an off camber could easily affect a cars' handling causing it to veer to the outside of the circuit.  As an Armco barrier on the outside of the corner eventually intersected with the grass verge, there was a significant lack of run off area for drivers forced wide on the bend.", "|  Paul Warwick", "|  Paul Warwick"]}, {"page": "Oulton Park International Gold Cup", "response": ["|  Paul Warwick"]}, {"page": "1990 International Formula 3000 Championship", "response": ["|  Paul Warwick", "|align=\"left\"|  Paul Warwick", "| - ||align=\"left\"|  Paul Warwick ||align=\"left\"| Leyton House Racing ||align=\"left\"| Leyton House ||align=\"left\"| Ford Cosworth ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| 22 ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| R ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| 19 ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| 8 ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| 21 ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| NS ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| 22 ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| 15"]}, {"page": "British Formula 3000", "response": ["The first two champions, Gary Brabham and Pedro Chaves, moved up to Formula One but met little success, never qualifying for a race.
