Inst. Metals (1880 \u2013 2 April 1921) was a British metallurgist and army officer.  An Army Ordnance Corps member, in 1906 he was stationed on Guernsey, where he wrote a novel, Diverse Affections: a Romance of Guernsey.  Garland rose to become Superintendent of Laboratories at the Cairo Citadel, Egypt by 1913 and received a grant from the Chemical Society, of which he was a fellow, to conduct research into ancient Egyptian alloys.  The outbreak of war saw him commissioned as a Special List officer with the Arab Bureau.  Garland developed explosives for the army, including the Garland grenade and was, in September 1916, assigned to train T. E. Lawrence and the fighters of the Arab Revolt in explosives.  His mines were used against the Hejaz Railway and may have been involved in the first derailing of a moving train by explosives.  Garland commanded the desperate defence of Yanbu in which he forced an attacking superior Ottoman force to withdraw with almost no bloodshed.  Awarded the Military Cross and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Garland became director of the Arab Bureau after the war and was involved in the post-war negotiations for the future of Arabia. Returning from Egypt because of poor health, Garland died within days of setting foot in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lawrence of Arabia (film)", "response": ["The film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Francis Newcombe, and Pierce C. Joyce, all of whom arrived before Lawrence began serving in Arabia.Murphy, David The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918, London: Osprey, 2008. p. 17 In addition, there was a French military mission led by Colonel Edouard Br\u00e9mond serving in the Hejaz but it is not mentioned in the film.Murphy, David The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918, London: Osprey, 2008. p. 18 The film shows Lawrence as the sole originator of the attacks on the Hejaz railroad. The first attacks began in early January 1917 led by officers such as Newcombe.Murphy, David The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918, London: Osprey, 2008. p. 39 The first successful attack on the Hejaz railroad with a locomotive-destroying \"Garland mine\" was led by Major Herbert Garland in February 1917, a month before Lawrence's first attack.Murphy, David The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918, London: Osprey, 2008. pp. 43\u201344"]}, {"page": "Arab Revolt", "response": ["In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the Hejaz, most notably Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C. Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe.Murphy, p. 17. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel  was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui (the latter two converted to Islam during their time in Arabia). Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army.", "The year 1917 began well for the Hashemites when the Emir Abdullah and his Arab Eastern Army ambushed an Ottoman convoy led by Ashraf Bey in the desert, and captured \u00a320,000 worth of gold coins that were intended to bribe the Bedouin into loyalty to the Sultan.Murphy, p. 38 Starting in early 1917, the Hashemite guerrillas began attacking the Hejaz railway.Murphy, pp. 39\u201343. At first, guerrilla forces commanded by officers from the Regular Army such as al-Misri, and by British officers such as Newcombe, Lieutenant Hornby and Major Herbert Garland focused their efforts on blowing up unguarded sections of the Hejaz railway. Garland was the inventor of the so-called \"Garland mine\", which was used with much destructive force on the Hejaz railway.Murphy, p. 43. In February 1917, Garland succeeded for the first time in destroying a moving locomotive with a mine of his own design. Around Medina, Captain Muhammad Ould Ali Raho of the French Military Mission carried out his first railway demolition attack in February 1917.Murphy, pp. 43\u201344. Captain Raho was to emerge as one of the leading destroyers of the Hejaz railway. In March 1917, Lawrence led his first attack on the Hejaz railway.Murphy, p. 44. Typical of such attacks were the one commanded out by Newcombe and Joyce who on the night of July 6/7, 1917 when they had planted over 500 charges on the Hejaz railway, which all went off at about 2\u00a0am. In a raid in August 1917, Captain Raho led a force of Bedouin in destroying 5 kilometers of the Hejaz railway and four bridges.Murphy, p. 45."]}, {"page": "Arab Bureau", "response": ["Gilbert Clayton was named head or \"chief\" of the Arab Bureau.

Developed early in the war by Herbert Garland, a pre-war metallurgist and superintendent of laboratories at the Cairo Citadel, it was the most numerous mortar of the Gallipoli Campaign.  A simple, improvised design, the Garland mortar consisted of a smoothbore steel barrel fixed at 45 degrees to a solid wooden base.  By means of a powder charge it propelled a variant of the jam tin grenade.  Its design meant that the whole weapon had to be turned to change its traverse and raised on a box to increase its range but despite these limitations it was reported to have done \"good work\" in the front line.", "The mortar was developed by Herbert Garland, superintendent of laboratories at the Cairo Citadel in Egypt.  The weapon was of straightforward construction, comprising a plain, smoothbore, tempered steel barrel of 65 mm calibre fitted at a fixed 45-degree angle to a solid wooden base.  There are references to the bombs themselves being variants of the improvised Jam Tin Grenade with a steel shaft affixed.  However the Australian War Museum holds an example of a more complex bomb with a three ounce gelignite charge and an impact detonation mechanism, mounted on a wooden shaft.  This latter type of grenade could also be modified to be thrown by hand."]}, {"page": "Garland grenade", "response": ["thumb|Herbert Garland in 1917", "The Garland grenade was a grenade and trench mortar bomb developed and used by British Empire forces in the First World War.  It was invented by the metallurgist Herbert Garland at the Cairo Citadel, and more than 174,000 were issued to the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.  The grenade was also used during the Arab Revolt.  The Mark I grenade was relatively primitive, being formed of an explosive-filled food tin with a fuse that was lit with a match.  The Mark II version was made of cast iron and could be fired from the Garland Trench Mortar.", "The Garland grenade was invented by Herbert Garland, a pre-war metallurgist who was Superintendent of the Explosives Laboratory and Magazines at Cairo Citadel.   Garland developed the grenades during the first year of the First World War (1914-1918); some 174,000 would be produced and issued to the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.  They were also used by T. E. Lawrence's Arab Revolt forces in their attacks on the Hejaz Railway.  Garland served with Lawrence in Arabia as an explosives expert and was responsible for much of the damage caused to the Ottoman railway system."]}]}}
