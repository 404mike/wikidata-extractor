Henry Widdowson has argued that \"there is a fundamental contradiction in the idea that the language of itself exerts hegemonic control: namely that if this were the case, you would never be able to challenge such control\".Henry Widdowson (1998a), p. 398. Additionally, the idea that the promotion of English necessarily implies a demotion of local languages has been challenged. Holborrow points out that \"not all Englishes in the centre dominate, nor are all speakers in the periphery equally discriminated against\".Holborrow (1993), p. 359; see also Bisong (1995 [1994]), p. 124. Irish English or New Zealand English or even England's regional dialects such as Cornish English, for instance, could be regarded as a non-dominant centre variety of English.", "However, Henry Widdowson\u2019s remarks on critical discourse analysis may also be applied to the critical applied linguists:"]}, {"page": "Critical discourse analysis", "response": ["*Henry Widdowson (1995).

Before the growth of communicative language teaching, the primary method of language teaching was situational language teaching, a method that was much more clinical in nature and relied less on direct communication. In Britain, applied linguists began to doubt the efficacy of situational language teaching, partly in response to Chomsky's insights into the nature of language. Chomsky had shown that the structural theories of language then prevalent could not explain the variety that is found in real communication. In addition, applied linguists like Christopher Candlin and Henry Widdowson observed that the current model of language learning was ineffective in classrooms. They saw a need for students to develop communicative skill and functional competence in addition to mastering language structures."]}, {"page": "ELTon awards", "response": ["*The British Council Lifetime Achievement Award \u2013  Henry Widdowson", "The 2015 British Council Lifetime Achievement Award winner, Henry Widdowson, is a leading authority in applied linguistics and in communicative language teaching, an approach which stresses the importance of interaction, authentic, natural language, a focus on the learning process, and on the student's personal experiences both inside and outside the classroom."]}, {"page": "Widdowson", "response": ["*Henry Widdowson, British linguist"]}, {"page": "H.
