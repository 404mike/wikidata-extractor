Her first book, Portraits and Sketches of Serbia (1920) aimed to publicize Serbia's need for post-war relief. From 1919 to 1922, Wilson worked with Hilda Clark and Edith Pye for the Quaker Relief Mission in Vienna, acting as an interpreter and organizing food depots. After meeting the art educator Franz Ci\u017eek, she organized an exhibition of child art by his pupils, raising money for the recently founded Save the Children Fund. The exhibition toured the UK and the US."]}, {"page": "Aline Atherton-Smith", "response": ["Atherton-Smith began working with victims of forced migration, particularly the Serbian refugees in Marseilles, with Florence Mary Barrow working with the French Red Cross.
