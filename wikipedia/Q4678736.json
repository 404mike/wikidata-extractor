His musical career started with two acts working simultaneously, releasing music on London-based label, Wall of Sound. He formed Zoot Woman with Adam Blake and Johnny Blake, and their debut 12\", Sweet To The Wind EP, was released in 1995. Around the same time, under the pseudonym Jacques Lu Cont, Price was making music as Les Rythmes Digitales. Initially choosing the name as a reference to the explosion in demand for French house in the United Kingdom during the 1990s, Price even went as far as to conduct interviews with British journalists in French via an interpreter. In interviews from around this time, Price also claimed that he had grown up listening exclusively to classical music, until one day encountering the album Dare by the Human League.", "Price has produced, and at times co-written, numerous songs for popular artists. Price has also remixed and re-produced numerous songs under his own name as well as the names Thin White Duke (originally created by David Bowie), Jacques Lu Cont, and Les Rythmes Digitales. Other aliases include Man with Guitar and Paper Faces (an alias for him and Adam Blake of the band Zoot Woman). Price's remixes are characterised by club-lead beats with arpeggios, riffs, and vocal lines faded and filtered throughout the song for a climactic effect.  He favours keeping the original vocal arrangement of songs and re-contextualizing the lyrical content in creating his new versions.", "Zoot Woman (with Adam Blake and Johnny Blake)"]}, {"page": "Zoot Woman", "response": ["Zoot Woman is a British electronic music group consisting of Adam Blake, Johnny Blake and Stuart Price.", "Price and Adam Blake also remix under the alias Paper Faces, as well as individually and have reworked tracks for Zoot Woman and established recording artists such as Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Scissor Sisters, Armand Van Helden, and Chromeo.
