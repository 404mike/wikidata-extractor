He was a professor of mathematics at the University of St Andrews, Dundee, Scotland. He was known for his contributions to the field of numerical analysis of partial differential equations in general and finite difference method and finite element method in particular. Mitchell has authored several influential books on numerical solution of partial differential equations, including \"The Finite Element Analysis in Partial Differential Equations\" with Richard Wait and \"The Finite Difference Method in Partial Differential Equations\" with David F.
