People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. Fielder-Civil then left Winehouse to revert to his previous girlfriend. During their break, she would write the bulk of the album on the state of her \"relationship at the time with Blake [Fielder-Civil]\" through themes of \"grief, guilt, and heartache\". Winehouse dated chef-musician Alex Clare briefly in 2006, and would later return to and marry Fielder-Civil in the following year.", "Winehouse and producer Mark Ronson both shared a publishing company, which encouraged a meeting between the two. They conversed in March 2006 in Ronson's New York studio that he used to have. They worked on six tracks together: \"Rehab\", \"Back to Black\", \"You Know I'm No Good\", \"Love Is a Losing Game\", \"Wake Up Alone\", and \"He Can Only Hold Her\". Ronson said in a 2010 interview with The Guardian that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work. She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an \"older man with a beard\". Ronson wrote \"Back to Black\" the night after he met Winehouse, explaining in a 2010 Mojo interview: \"I just thought, 'Let's talk about music, see what she likes.' She said she liked to go out to bars and clubs and play snooker with her boyfriend and listen to the Shangri-Las. So she played me some of those records ... I told her that I had nothing to play her right now but if she [lets] me work on something overnight she could come back tomorrow. So I came up with this little piano riff, which became the verse chords to 'Back to Black.' Behind it I just put a kick drum and a tambourine and tons of reverb.\" Winehouse's father later recalled the formulation of \"Rehab\" in his memoir: \"One day [Ronson and Winehouse] decided to take a quick stroll around the neighborhood because Amy wanted to buy [her then-boyfriend] Alex Clare a present ... on the way back Amy began telling Mark about being with Blake [Fielder-Civil, her ex], then not being with Blake and being with Alex instead. She told him about the time at my house after she'd been in hospital when everyone had been going on at her about her drinking: 'You know they tried to make me go to rehab, and I told them, no, no, no.' 'That's quite gimmicky,' Mark replied. 'It sounds hooky. You should go back to the studio and we should turn that into a song.'\" The majority of the songs produced by Ronson were completed at Daptone Records\u2014along with the instrumental help of The Dap-Kings\u2014in Brooklyn, New York. Three of the horn players from the group played a baritone saxophone, a tenor saxophone, and a trumpet. Ronson recorded the trio to create the \"'60s-sounding metallics\" on the album. The drums, piano, guitar, and bass were all done together in one room, with the drums being recorded with one microphone. There was also much spill between the instruments. Additional production of the album was located at Chung King and Allido Studios in New York City, and at Metropolis Records in London. In the Allido studio, Ronson used synthesisers and vintage keyboards to display the sound landscape for the album, including the Wurlitzer electric piano. In May of that year, Winehouse's demo tracks such as \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Rehab\" appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of \"Pumps\" and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish entertainers", "response": ["*Alex Clare, singer"]}, {"page": "Mr Hudson", "response": ["Establishing his own studio in 2010 Hudson began writing and producing for other acts including Paloma Faith, Alex Clare, Pixie Lott, and Wretch 32.
