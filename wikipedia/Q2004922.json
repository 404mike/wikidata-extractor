His career was revived by a loan spell at Dumbarton in 2006, and he then scored 55 goals in 105 appearances for Queen of the South in his first spell at Palmerston Park, playing in the club's first-ever appearance in the Scottish Cup Final in 2008.\nDobbie moved to Swansea City in 2009. Dobbie was loaned to Blackpool and won promotion to the Premier League, winning the 2010 play-offs. Dobbie returned to Swansea City and again won promotion to the Premier League via the 2011 play-offs. Dobbie was again loaned to Blackpool in 2012 and played in a third successive play-off final, this time as a runner-up. In 2012 he signed for Brighton & Hove Albion before joining Crystal Palace, initially on loan, where he helped the Eagles to win promotion in 2013 to the Premier League.Dobbie then had a third spell at Blackpool and played for Fleetwood Town and Bolton Wanderers, before returning to Scotland in August 2016 to sign for the Doonhamers for a second spell, where he scored a further 111 goals in 178 appearances.

They were drawn in a qualification round against Danish club FC Nordsj\u00e6lland. The first leg, hosted at the Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie, was played in a quagmire with the Danes running out 2\u20131 winners. Queens delivered a stronger performance in the return leg, controlling most of the game but with only one goal to show for their superiority. With a 1\u20130 victory of no value in an aggregate result due to the away goals rule and Queens pushing all out for the second goal, the Danes took advantage to score two goals in the last five minutes. Chisholm's team selection for the UEFA Cup ties caused some surprise. With Stephen Dobbie the most prolific striker at the club in a generation, Chisholm started with Dobbie on the bench for both ties instead preferring the workmanlike Stewart Kean.\"Congratulations Stephen Dobbie\" www.qosfc.com 30 May 2011"]}, {"page": "Danny Gabbidon", "response": ["On 18 September 2012 Gabbidon signed for Crystal Palace.

He made his debut in the away fixture against Newcastle United, coming on as a second-half substitute, and scored his first goal for Swansea in a 2\u20131 FA Cup third round defeat to Leicester City on 2 January 2010. Following the move being made permanent for a then club record fee of \u00a3600,000, Cotterill scored three more goals during the 2009\u201310 season. The arrival of Scott Sinclair at the beginning of the 2010\u201311 season saw Cotterill employed more as a second striker behind Stephen Dobbie, rather than on the wing. Cotterill started the season off well under new manager Brendan Rodgers, putting in some good performances and converting a penalty in a 4\u20130 win over Preston North End. However, Cotterill then missed his next two penalties which on both occasions would have put his side in the lead and his confidence on the pitch appeared to drop. Cotterill was eventually sent out on loan to fellow Championship side Portsmouth in February 2011 initially on a one-month loan deal, taking the number 17 shirt vacated by John Utaka. He made his debut two days later in a 1\u20130 win over Barnsley, and scored his first goal for his new club against Ipswich Town on 26 February.

His second goal of the season came when he scored the opening goal in a 4\u20133 victory over Middlesbrough on 12 February 2011. His form was sustained throughout the campaign, and he was eventually named Swansea City Supporters' Player of the Year 2010\u201311. Dyer played an important role in the Football League Championship's play-off final in which he made a double assist, for both Stephen Dobbie and Scott Sinclair, in a 4\u20132 win over Reading.

McCabe promised a more attacking approach differing from the defensive style that Martin had employed. He also had the difficult but widely expected task of gaining promotion after only one season in the Scottish Third Division. McCabe signed former Kilmarnock Scottish Cup winner David Bagan and Stephen Dobbie on loan from St Johnstone. Dobbie scored 10 goals in 17 league games which pushed Dumbarton into a high league position. However Dobbie's loan spell ended in December 2006. Any chances of a loan extension were dashed when Dobbie signed permanently for Scottish First Division side Queen of the South. After Dobbie's departure the goals dried up and Dumbarton just fell short of a promotion play-off place and finished in fifth place. McCabe succeeded in leading Dumbarton to a Scottish Cup 3rd round tie against SPL champions Celtic which they lost 4\u20130.
