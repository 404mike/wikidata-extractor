When she asks why Aaron would choose to steal from her, Aaron tells her about Gordon's abuse. Aaron returns the money and he purchases The Mill for himself, Robert and Liv. Aaron ( played by Bryan Parry, in Ashley's vision) finds a confused Ashley wandering around the streets of Hotten and offers to bring him back to the village.

Aaron then encourages Chas and Paddy to get back together.", "Jake Roche auditioned for the role of Aaron, however, it was actor Danny Webb who was eventually cast. Aaron first appeared in Emmerdale in 2003 as a recurring character. In 2008, Aaron was reintroduced as a full-time cast member and the decision was made to recast the part. Former Grange Hill actor Danny Miller successfully auditioned for the role of Aaron. Miller admitted in an interview with Sue Crawford of The People that he would have quit acting for good if he had not landed the role.
