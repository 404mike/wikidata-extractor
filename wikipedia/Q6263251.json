He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Tasmania in 1890.  He was appointed Photographer to the Government of Tasmania on 21 December 1896.\nHe did extensive photography around Tasmania, as well as in the Central Highlands and on the West Coast of Tasmania. He was employed by the North Mount Lyell Company to photograph between Gormanston, Tasmania and Kelly Basin in the 1890s.\nBeattie travelled with lantern slide shows on various subjects \u2013 A trip through Tasmania, From Kelly's Basin to Gormanston as well as  Port Arthur and Tasman Peninsula His photographic images of places such as Port Arthur and the Isle of the Dead were used as postcards in the early twentieth century.Beattie's work was notable in that it crystallised around a Romantic tradition that promoted a sympathetic orientation to the natural world. His sublime pictures of Tasmanian wilderness and Port Arthur in particular helped settlers and activists argue for the protection of nature through the 1890s and into the twentieth century.  In the 1890s he also prepared composite pictures of the Governors of Tasmania 1804\u20131895, as well as Parliamentarians of Tasmania 1856\u20131895.\nHe also travelled to Norfolk Island and did photographic work there as well.

Meredith noted in her 1939 diary a daguerreotype demonstration in Hobart and was certainly interested in the medium. She was a friend of Tasmanian John Watt Beattie in the 1880s and he records her giving him assistance as a photographer, and of her showing him the \"many specimens of both her own and the Bishop Nixon's photographic work in those early days of the very black art,\" and that she had been \"instrumental in having the last remnant of the Tasmanian Aboriginals photographed for the purposes of science.\"Beattie quoted in the Tasmanian Mail, 26 October 1895 However, though these are records of her making them, not one of Meredith's photographs survives."]}, {"page": "James Watt Beattie", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Watt Beattie"]}, {"page": "John Beattie", "response": ["* John Watt Beattie (1859\u20131930), Australian photographer and fellow of the Royal Society of Tasmania "]}, {"page": "Jeff Carter (photographer)", "response": ["* John Watt Beattie "]}, {"page": "Haughton Forrest", "response": ["In 1899, his views of Mount Wellington and Hobart, some based on photographs by John Watt Beattie, were chosen for Australia's first set of pictorial stamps.
