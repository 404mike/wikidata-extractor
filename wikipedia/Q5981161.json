He expressed disbelief stating \"I do not believe ... that he has fully run any of the major sections of the world he has claimed, or even a substantial portion of any section.\" Blaikie also cited the lack of any support team or helpers to help him carry food and water and his lack of experience with ultramarathons as reasons to doubt Garside's claims. Steven Seaton, then editor of Runner's World, also pointed out Garside's lack of previous experience with ultramarathons, saying, \"Some of the things he has claimed to have achieved would constitute world records for ultrarunning, which is nonsense for somebody who is claiming to have run almost every day. He went into this with no outstanding ultra-credentials, which makes it difficult to believe what he claims to have done.\" A demonstration for Richard and Judy on Channel 4 in the UK, for which Garside agreed to rerun the 130 miles he stated he had run in 24 hours (a routine distance for an ultrarunner), observed by witnesses including Ian Champion of the London to Brighton Run and UK Road Runners Club, resulted in Garside pulling out after 72 miles.Ultramarathon World, David Blaikie, 2004-04-27 As well as hiding his 1997 restart, Garside had also apparently admitted to shortening his route by 1300\u00a0km by taking an airplane from Mexico City to the United States border; his diary left the impression of 10 days to run 1300\u00a0km, a world record if true. Jesse Dale Riley of the Trans-American Footrace expressed concern that Garside's records showed him crossing 746 miles of the Nullarbor Plain without a support crew, stating that \"I know a lot of people who have crossed the Nullarbor but I've never heard of anyone doing it alone. The issue of water supply alone casts serious doubt. It's totally inconceivable to me how anyone could do such a thing and survive\".", "Koeppel also found that contrary to prior claims, Garside indeed had a prior record as a runner and in particular as a sub-3-hour marathon runner, including three well-known marathons where he had \"done well\" in 1994 with times of 3.01 (London Marathon), 2.48 (Brussels Marathon) and 3.10 (Amsterdam Marathon) respectively; Garside's comment on his televised demonstration (ended at 72 miles of 130) was that mentally and emotionally, \"running in circles\" round a track \u2013 which he had not done before \u2013 had not been at all like long-distance cross-country running, and was \"demoraliz[ing]\"; Ian Champion softened his opinion on the matter as a result, commenting that it could indeed have been \"situational\".", "Upon announcement of authentication in 2007, there was a measure of concern that the feat should be scrutinized carefully or seemed dubious. The Guardian quoted Ian Champion of the UK Road Runners Club, who had been called upon to judge Garside's uncompleted supervised 24-hour road test in April 2004, as saying he was \"stunned\" at the decision, with the paper noting his non-completion of the 130-mile 24-hour run in near-ideal conditions under observation. Reuters described the award as \"a major vindication for Garside\".\"Runningman\" makes it into record books at last \u2013 Reuters, 2007-03-26"]}, {"page": "Champion (surname)", "response": ["* Ian Champion (born 1968), English actor"]}, {"page": "Sacrilege (2020 film)", "response": ["|Ian Champion"]}]}}
