With the absence of David Rudisha due to injury the 800 m final was relatively wide open. However, with Bosse not having run close to the world lead, and having to start his season late due to injury he was not considered a favorite. The final went out at a moderate pace with the leader Brandon McBride passing through 400 m in 50.76. While Kipyegon Bett and Nijel Amos battled each other as they took the lead, Bosse ran a clear path around the outside to take the lead going into the final turn. He emerged from the turn with a three-metre lead on the battle and neither could muster a challenge. His final challengers were Adam Kszczot and Kyle Langford, making a late run from the back of the pack, but Bosse was too far ahead to see the challengers. He looked at the scoreboard, pointing at himself in disbelief.https://media.aws.iaaf.org/competitiondocuments/pdf/5151/AT-800-M-f----.RS6.pdf"]}, {"page": "Kyle Langford", "response": ["Kyle Langford may refer to:", "* Kyle Langford (footballer) (born 1996),  Australian rules footballer", "* Kyle Langford (runner) (born 1996), British middle-distance runner", "* Kyle Langford (sailor) (born 1989), Australian sailor"]}, {"page": "2015 British Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Kyle Langford ||1:49.70"]}, {"page": "England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Kyle Langford", "|align=left|Kyle Langford"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2018 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 800 metres", "response": ["The men's 800\u00a0metres at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, as part of the athletics programme, took place in the Carrara Stadium between 10 and 12 April 2018.
