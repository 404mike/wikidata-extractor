The visual record of the expedition was the responsibility of its photographer Frank Hurley and its artist George Marston.Fisher 1957, pp.\u00a0311\u2013314. The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. Some who left Britain for Australia to join Aurora resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp.\u00a048\u201353. Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the Nimrod expedition and had gone home early."]}, {"page": "Endurance (1912 ship)", "response": ["* James McIlroy, Surgeon"]}, {"page": "Frank Wild", "response": ["On returning to the United Kingdom in 1916, Wild volunteered for duty during World War I and was made a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After taking a Russian language course, Wild became the Royal Navy's transport officer at Archangel, where he superintended the war materials which arrived during the Allied intervention in Russia. After the war, Wild went to South Africa, where he farmed in British Nyasaland with Francis Bickerton and James McIlroy, two former Antarctic comrades."]}, {"page": "Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition", "response": ["Frank Wild, on his fourth trip with Shackleton, filled the second-in-command post as he had on the Endurance  expedition. Frank Worsley, Endurances former captain, became captain of Quest. Other old comrades included surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy, meteorologist Leonard Hussey, engineer Alexander Kerr, seaman Tom McLeod and cook Charles Green. Shackleton had assumed that Tom Crean would sign up, and had assigned him duties \"in charge of boats\", but Crean had retired from the navy to start a family back home in County Kerry, and declined Shackleton's invitation.Smith, p.\u00a0308."]}, {"page": "Perce Blackborow", "response": ["On 15 June, with Shackleton and the James Caird crew having been away for a month, Macklin, assisted by James McIlroy, carried out an amputation of Blackborow's left foot, using chloroform for anesthesia.

He built the quarters where the crew took their meals (nicknamed The Ritz) and cubicles where the men could sleep. These were all christened as well; McNish shared The Sailors' Rest with Alfred Cheetham, the Third Officer. Assisted by the crew, he constructed kennels for the dogs on the upper deck. Once Endurance became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for the men. To pass the time in the evening, McNish joined Frank Wild, Tom Crean, James McIlroy, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the wardroom."]}, {"page": "Shackleton (TV serial)", "response": ["* Pip Torrens as James McIlroy"]}, {"page": "Pip Torrens", "response": ["| 2001 || Shackleton || James McIlroy || Television film"]}, {"page": "Frank Bickerton", "response": ["In 1920, Bickerton joined fellow Antarctic veterans, Frank Wild and Dr James McIlroy, on an expedition to East Africa.

Having found the Portuguese authorities \"impossible\" they moved on to Fort Johnstone in British Nyasaland where they cleared  of forest.

He was a popular member of the group due to his humour and perpetual playing of his five-string banjo,Kimmel, p. 33. in company with Dr. James McIlroy's imitations of the trombone and bagpipes.  Frank Worsley stated \"Hussey was a brilliant wit, and his keen repartee was one of the few joys left to us. Often we would combine to provoke him just for the pleasure of hearing his clever retorts and invariably he would emerge the victor, no matter how many of us tried to best him.\"Perkins, Holtman, Kessler and McCarthy, p. 119. On 22 June 1915, Hussey and the crew staged a four-hour \"smoking concert\" and costume party, during which Hussey dressed as a black minstrel. Roland Huntford recorded in Shackleton of Hussey's tendency to be \"determinedly cheery to the point of egregiousness\"."]}]}}
