In 1896 he joined the civil service (Inland Revenue Department). Later he read for the Bar and was called to Gray's Inn. He practised law in London until 1916 when he joined the Mond Nickel Company. Rising through the ranks, he eventually became chief administrative officer of the company. He later became vice-president of the International Nickel Company of Canada.\nHe was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiganshire at a by-election in 1932, following the resignation of the Liberal MP Rhys Hopkin Morris.  Evans held the seat until his sudden death, probably of heart failure, shortly before the 1945 general election. His death robbed him of becoming a Knight Bachelor; his appointment had been announced in the Dissolution Honours List published on 7 June 1945 but he died before he could be knighted.\nIn public life in Wales he was a member of the Councils of the University colleges of Aberystwyth and Swansea, treasurer of the college at Aberystwyth and of the National Museum of Wales. He was also a governor and member of the Council of the National Library of Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["In 1932, Morris left Parliament temporarily (he was later to return as MP for Carmarthen) when he was appointed as a Metropolitan Police magistrate.

With only a Labour opponent he comfortably held the seat. He was re-elected in the 1950 general election with the largest Liberal majority at that election, despite facing both Conservative and Labour opposition. During most of the 1950s he was one of a tiny group of only five or six Liberal MPs left at Westminster. He failed to succeed Clement Davies as leader of the Liberal Party in 1956 when Jo Grimond was chosen. Politically, he was on the right of the Liberal Party. During the Suez Crisis, he defended the Conservative Government against opposition \"carping criticisms\". One of the chief opposition critics of the Government over Suez was his own party leader, Jo Grimond."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Owen Evans"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|Owen Evans"]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* Owen Evans, Cardiganshire, 1932\u201345"]}, {"page": "1945 in Wales", "response": ["*11 June \u2013 Owen Evans  MP, politician, 69"]}, {"page": "1932 Cardiganshire by-election", "response": ["1.
