A 1923 report by the British Army about Kut concluded that \"visits by the commander and his staff to the troops would have been even more effective\" at sustaining morale rather than the \"barrage of communiqu\u00e9s\" that Townshend unleashed.Perry, James Arrogant Armies, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 268. Townshend spent almost all of his time either in his headquarters, a two-storey mud house, writing up messages or \"gazing out across the Turkish lines from his observation post on the roof\". He was violently disturbed by the news that Gorringe had replaced Aylmer as commander of the relief force, since this offered the undignified prospect of being rescued by an officer of inferior rank. In a long radio message, Townshend described Gorringe's assignment as \"a slight on my record of service... I am deeply concerned to have brought up the question of promotion at so inopportune a time, but my active-service record is a honourable one and like my family before me for the past 300 years, I have served the state well\". The British psychologist Norman F. Dixon wrote that Townshend's often irrational behaviour at Kut was due to \"cognitive dissonance\", writing: \"No better example [of cognitive dissonance] is afforded than that of Townshend's occupation of Kut. Since his advance up the Tigris was totally unjustified by facts of which he was fully aware, his dissonance, when disaster struck, must have been extreme and, to a man of his egotistical nature, demanding of instant resolution. So, again, in the face of much contrary evidence, he withdrew into Kut. The wiser and possible course of retreating to Basra would have been a greater admission of the lack of justification for his previous decision. By the same token, once inside Kut nothing would budge him, because to break out, even to assist those who had been sent to release him, would have emphasised his lack of justification for being there in the first place. When a British artillery officer almost killed Goltz with a well-aimed shot (Goltz stood out by dressing in the full uniform of a Prussian Field Marshal and because of his weight), Townshend was extremely angry, saying that he did not want Goltz killed because if he had to surrender Kut, it was much better to surrender to a German officer rather an Ottoman officer. By the end of the siege, Townshend's men were living on five ounces of bread per day and a slice of mule meat. Townshend grew increasingly desperate as the siege went on, at one time sending off a message claiming that if Kut fell, it would be a worse defeat than Yorktown, maintaining that the entire Islamic world would rally for the Ottomans if he had to surrender and this would be the beginning of the end of the British Empire.Galbraith, John \"No Man's Child: The Campaign in Mesopotamia, 1914\u20131916\" pages 358\u2013385 from The International History Review, Volume 6, Issue # 3, August 984-page 358 In March 1916, the Ottomans began particular heavy bombardments of Kut, and they were seen unloading mysterious canisters from a barge, which everyone assumed was poison gas from Germany.Knight, Paul The British Army in Mesopotamia, 1914\u20131918, Jefferson: McFarland, 2013 page 73. Morale began to collapse among the Indians as more and more Indians began to desert, there were several cases of Indian soldiers killing their NCOs and many Indians began to engage in self-mutilation to get themselves into the presumed safety of the hospital.Knight, Paul The British Army in Mesopotamia, 1914\u20131918, Jefferson: McFarland, 2013 pages 72\u201373. Whenever news of German advances at the Battle of Verdun reached the Ottoman lines, the Turks would give a giant three cheers for Germany while Townshend was comforted when he received a message over the radio that the Russians had taken by storm the allegedly impregnable Ottoman city-fortress of Erzerum, which he believed meant the Russians would soon relieve him.Knight, Paul The British Army in Mesopotamia, 1914\u20131918, Jefferson: McFarland, 2013 page 72."]}, {"page": "Dixon (surname)", "response": ["*Norman F.

Dixon"]}, {"page": "Rommel myth", "response": ["A number of contemporaries noted Rommel's vanity. In the memorandum regarding  Rommel's betrayal, Martin Bormann remarked, \"He had himself photographed from dawn to dusk\u00a0... He is so vain he does not wear glasses\". (Rommel was near-sighted in one eye and far-sighted in the other.) Historian Samuel Mitchell however, noted that Martin Borman had held a grudge against the Field Marshall as far back as 1939.Mitcham, Samuel W. (1984) Triumphant Fox: Erwin Rommel and the Rise of the Afrika Korps Some modern authors, such as Storbeck, are more sympathetic. He states that Rommel's perceived vanity developed as a reaction to the pressure aristocratic and high-bourgeois colleagues put on him. The psychologist Norman F. Dixon remarks that although Rommel showed towards Hitler an admiration that later faded, he did not display the urge to submit himself to higher authority or powerful father figures, considering that had he been such a person, he would not have been so outspoken or risked himself in the struggle against people like Himmler, Keitel or Jodl. Showalter comments that Rommel was a man who brought his work home, but not to the point of obsession with personal promotions, considering he had spent no effort in building a social circle (his wife was the person who determined their family's social agenda and the guest list, and the circle she chose was not wide nor prominent)."]}, {"page": "On the Psychology of Military Incompetence", "response": ["On The Psychology of Military Incompetence is a work by Norman F. Dixon, first published in 1976, which applies insights from psychology to military history. After case studies of military and naval disasters from the preceding 120 years, mostly British, it offers in readable, not technical, style an analysis of the personality of the unsuccessful leader. Its conclusions are equally applicable to other less deadly forms of human organisation."]}]}}
