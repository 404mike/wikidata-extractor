Viewed from afar, these squares appear as a single, unified image which attempt photo-reality, albeit in pixelated form.  Although the paralysis restricted his ability to paint as meticulously as before, Close had, in a sense, placed artificial restrictions upon his hyperrealist approach well before the injury. That is, he adopted materials and techniques that did not lend themselves well to achieving a photorealistic effect. Small bits of irregular paper or inked fingerprints were used as media to achieve astoundingly realistic and interesting results. Close proved able to create his desired effects even with the most difficult of materials to control. Close made a practice, during his final years, of portraying artists who are similarly invested in portraiture, like Cecily Brown, Kiki Smith, Cindy Sherman, and Zhang Huan.Martha Schwendener (September 27, 2013), Works in Conversation With Photography  The New York Times.", "These works were called Close's first major foray into digital imagery:\"After Decades of Pixel Painting, Chuck Close Goes Truly Digital.\"  Co.Design.
