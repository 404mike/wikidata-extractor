Chris Poulton was righthand man to Ronnie Stirling and a team of designers worked for the brand. A key survival strategy was to continually drip-feed new styles into stores throughout the season, combining staple fashion items with more outrageous lines to attract attention. Poulton noted: \"Our aim is always to stick to an identifiable look so that people who like us will always look for our label\". By this stage, the business encompassed a shop in New Bond Street, a concession in Peter Robinson and a wholesale showroom servicing 30 in-store concessions nationally, as well as licensing and distribution deals internationally. South African-born Michael Conitzer, who had joined Stirling Cooper in 1972 after training at Marks & Spencer, went on to become managing director. In 1980, he began to market a range of condoms in the stores which later became the Jiffi brand."]}, {"page": "Marks, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Marks"]}]}}
