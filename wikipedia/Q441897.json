Gary Locke was placed in interim charge, before signing a three-year deal in April 2015. Kilmarnock went on to lose seven of their final eight games of the season, but were spared the play-off spot after a 4\u20131 win over Partick Thistle. The 2015\u201316 season would prove difficult for the team. Gary Locke was removed from his position as manager in February 2016, with Lee Clark being appointed as his replacement. Despite a small uplift in form, the team finished in 11th place and faced a relegation play-off against championship side Falkirk in order to stay in the top flight. Despite losing 0\u20131 in the first leg, Killie fought back and comfortably won the second leg 4\u20130 (4\u20131 on aggregate), securing the club\u2019s status in the Scottish Premiership for another season. Clark would leave Kilmarnock for a return to England with Bury in February 2017, exactly a year after his arrival.

He suffered a knee injury setback in 2004, and was out of the game for almost a year, not making an appearance until late in the 2004\u201305 season. He was only able to make 5 appearances as Wigan were promoted, and he lost his place to the young Leighton Baines. McMillan only made two league appearances for Wigan in their debut Premiership season, against Charlton and Fulham. He picked up a bad knee injury in the League Cup semi-final against Arsenal, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. A year after the knee injury, McMillan announced his retirement on 27 February 2007."]}]}}
