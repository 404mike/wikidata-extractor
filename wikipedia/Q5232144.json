Cricket writer Colin Bateman noted that \"Capel was one of those unfortunate cricketers who became tagged as being the next all-rounder to fill Ian Botham's boots\". He was well known for his long stint with Northamptonshire as a player as well as coach for nearly 32 years. He was regarded as one of the icons of the Northamptonshire club. He died on 2 September 2020, at the age of 57, after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 6", "response": ["*1963 \u2013 David Capel, English cricketer (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "1963", "response": ["** David Capel, English cricketer (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Subsequently, the club has seen mixed fortunes.

He made an immediate impression by taking the wicket of former England all-rounder David Capel with his first ball, and scoring 91 in his first innings.  However, his early years as a first-class player were characterised by steady and relatively modest performances with bat and ball: in each season from 1996 to 2000, his batting average was between 20 and 30 and his bowling average was between 30 and 60."]}, {"page": "Derek Pringle", "response": ["By the turn of the year he had lost his place to another aspiring all-rounder, David Capel from Northampton, who played in the Bicentenary Test in Sydney as well as the Test series in New Zealand.

Arguably that game was his highest point for England.", "Pringle again bowled adequately in the first two Tests (Ian Botham being out for the season after his back operation) but, batting at number six, was exposed against the firepower of the West Indies pace attack. David Capel replaced him for Manchester, but a poor performance from Capel saw Pringle recalled again for Leeds where he took five wickets. He took several more at the Oval in the fifth Test, and briefly captained the team from the evening of the third day after Graham Gooch sustained a serious finger injury attempting to take a catch at first slip from Desmond Haynes.

Childs joined the recalled Gatting and DeFreitas, and newcomer David Capel. Small and Jarvis were both unavailable as a result of injury, and Pringle was dropped.  Most media attention however was focused on Broad, who was also dropped, \"ostensibly for his consistent failure to make runs in home Tests, but there was always a suspicion that he was being disciplined for the incident at Lord's when he was spotted by a television camera mouthing his disappointment at an lbw decision\".
