He spent time on loan at Cowdenbeath (in 2001\u201302), before establishing himself as Hearts' first-choice keeper between 2003 and 2007, winning the Scottish Cup in 2005\u201306. English Premier League club Sunderland bought him in 2007 for \u00a39 million (then the British transfer record fee for a goalkeeper).Gordon suffered serious injuries during his time with Sunderland and was released from his contract in 2012. After two years out of the game, Gordon signed for Celtic in July 2014. He won five Scottish league titles, two Scottish Cups and four Scottish League Cups with Celtic, including domestic trebles in 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319. He left Celtic and returned to Hearts in June 2020.\nGordon was the regular goalkeeper for the Scotland national football team between 2004 and 2010, before injuries interrupted his career, and returned to the national set-up in 2014. He made the Scotland national football team roll of honour, having made his fiftieth full international appearance for Scotland in 2017.

On several occasions, Sagnol had good efforts on goal as well as still supplying his trademark crosses for teammates like Thierry Henry against Scotland at Hampden Park on 7 October 2006. Sagnol was one of his country's better performers in France's shock loss, having an impressive three efforts on goal from his right back spot, one in particular forcing a superb save from the Scottish goalkeeper Craig Gordon. The following match, against the Faroe Islands in Paris, was his 50th for his country. His displays in that qualification campaign once more provided proof that Sagnol could be counted on for his consistent defensive play and also to provide extra quality when joining the attack."]}, {"page": "Nolberto Solano", "response": ["Solano signed a one-year contract with West Ham United in August 2007. He made his debut for West Ham in October 2007, coming on as a second-half substitute in the 3\u20131 home win against Sunderland, and was instrumental in West Ham's second goal, his shot being deflected into the Sunderland goal by goalkeeper, Craig Gordon. His first goal for West Ham was a free-kick and the fifth goal in West Ham's 5\u20130 away win against Derby County on 10 November 2007.

He has since won over 40 caps, despite having had to compete with Craig Gordon and Allan McGregor for the goalkeeping position in the national team for much of his career. Marshall played a key role in Scotland's qualification for UEFA Euro 2020, as he made decisive saves in penalty shootouts against Israel and Serbia.", "After his standout performance for Celtic against Barcelona in the 2003\u201304 UEFA Cup, Marshall was selected by Scotland national football team. He made his full international debut on 18 August 2004 in a friendly against Hungary. Some observers expected Marshall to establish himself as the first choice goalkeeper for Scotland, but Craig Gordon and then Allan McGregor were picked more regularly instead.", "Marshall stated in May 2009 that he aimed to reignite his career for the national team. With first choice keeper Craig Gordon injured, he went on to play in two of Scotland's following three matches, a 4\u20130 defeat to Norway and a 1\u20130 defeat to Netherlands. Marshall performed creditably against the Dutch, but Scotland had lost in all of his five appearances to date, conceding 15 goals in total.", "Marshall was first choice during UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, but was dropped after a 3\u20130 defeat to Slovakia in October 2016. Steve Clarke recalled him in June 2019, when he played in the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Belgium. Marshall saved an effort from Eran Zahavi during a penalty shootout against Israel in October 2020, which helped Scotland progress in the Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs. He then saved the decisive penalty in another shootout in the playoff final against Serbia, which qualified Scotland for their first major tournament in 22 years. His appearance in those matches also set a record for the longest-spanning international career for a Scottish player (16 years 2 months and 26 days), exceeding a record set by 19th-century goalkeeper Ned Doig (Jim Leighton's time ended within two months of Doig's mark); however, Marshall was overtaken by Craig Gordon in the next fixture,Scotland Players by Career Span, London Hearts Supporters Club; retrieved 6 February 2021 with both players remaining active and potentially able to extend their career span further."]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 in Scottish football", "response": ["| Young Player of the Year ||  Craig Gordon || Heart of Midlothian"]}, {"page": "Steven Pressley", "response": ["He acted as a spokesman for the playing squad in response to the various controversies affecting the club under the ownership of Vladimir Romanov.

Romanov stated that he would sell players if Hearts failed to beat Dunfermline Athletic, a match which ended 1\u20131. However, this game was played out in front of a sell-out crowd who showed their vocal backing for Pressley, Gordon and Hartley. Pressley was then absent from the Hearts squad to face Falkirk on 13 November 2006 and he had been reportedly stripped of the captaincy. A month later, on 9 December 2006, it was confirmed that Pressley and Hearts had parted company and was reported to be attracting the interest of several clubs."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 in Scottish football", "response": ["| Footballer of the Year ||  Craig Gordon || Heart of Midlothian"]}]}}
