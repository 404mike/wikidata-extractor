However, his major editors, Simon Wilkin in the nineteenth century (1834) and Sir Geoffrey Keynes in the twentieth (1924), summarily dismissed it. Keynes considered its humour too erudite and \"not to everyone's taste\"."]}, {"page": "John Curtis (entomologist)", "response": ["Curtis was born in Norwich and learned his engraving skills in the workshop of his father, Charles Morgan Curtis. Charles Curtis died young and his widow, Frances, became a flower grower. She encouraged her son to study natural history with a local naturalist, Richard Walker (1791\u20131870). At the age of 16 he became an apprentice at a local lawyer's office in Norwich but devoted his spare time to studying and drawing insects and, with insect collecting becoming a growing craze, he found he could make a living selling the specimens he found. At this time he became a friend of Simon Wilkin (1790\u20131862), finally leaving his job and living with Wilkin at Costessey where he undertook systematic insect studies. Through Wilkin he met the entomologists William Kirby and William Spence and his illustrations were published in An Introduction to Entomology (1815\u20131826)."]}, {"page": "John Burrell (entomologist)", "response": ["Burrell was a close friend of John Curtis, William Kirby, Simon Wilkin, and William Spence, who all shared his interest in entomology."]}, {"page": "James Crossley (author)", "response": ["He perpetrated a literary fraud, the forging of Fragment on Mummies, supposedly by Sir Thomas Browne, that was a highly successful hoax.Kane, Robert J. (1933) James Crossley, Sir Thomas Browne, and the Fragment on Mummies, in: \"The Review of English Studies\", Vol. 9, No. 35 (July 1933), pp. 266-274.

On the liberal side in his politics, though a moderate, he did not bring them into his discourses. He looked to Biblical prophesy to interpret current affairs. William Wilkin Wilkin (1762\u20131799) of his congregation was a personal friend, as well as a radical. When Wilkin died in 1799, Kinghorn brought up and educated his son Simon Wilkin."]}, {"page": "Thomas Starling Norgate", "response": ["Norgate became involved in periodical writing, through a number of personal contacts.
