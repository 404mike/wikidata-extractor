Chrissie is unable to get them to leave Walford again, but is able to forge her friendship with Sharon over the belief that Den left the country with another woman. Chrissie also supports Sharon and Dennis when they decide to get married. By then, Sam is overwhelmed with frustration and desperation in her little efforts to win her conflict against Chrissie. After Chrissie taunts her once more, Sam gets drunk and goes against Kat's reservations in another attempt to get one over Chrissie. On the day Sharon and Dennis get married, Sam smashes up Den's grave and digs up his body in the hope that Chrissie will be sent down for his death; she ends up getting arrested after assaulting the pub's barmaid, Tracey (Jane Slaughter), in the midst of unearthing Den's corpse. When this becomes public knowledge, Den is officially pronounced dead and Chrissie feigns grief whilst also comforting Sharon over her loss. The police later take Chrissie at the station for questioning after Sam tells them everything about Den's murder. However, this backfires when Den's bloodstains are found under Sam's sink and her story constantly changes as a result. Chrissie seizes an opportunity to incriminate Sam for the crime by convincing Kat to get her cousin, Stacey (Lacey Turner), to give the police a false alibi that Zoe and Chrissie were with her on the night Den died. Feeling that she has no other way to protect her daughter, Kat agrees as that means Zoe is cleared from the police's viewpoint on her involvement in Den's murder. Resultingly, Sam is arrested and held in prison for Den's murder while Chrissie appears to have seemingly got away with the crime."]}, {"page": "Jane Slaughter", "response": ["Jane Slaughter (born January 9, 1949) is an American journalist who writes frequently on labor affairs.

Fi and Shirley meet again shortly later when Fi enters The Vic just as Shirley opens a bottle of champagne, which accidentally soaks Fi. Fi dries herself and introduces herself to the workforce, immediately telling Shirley and Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) they have too many staff and need to cut back. The Carters think Woody should leave, Fi insists that Grafton Hill want him to remain, so acting bar manager Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) and barmaid Tracey (Jane Slaughter) are ultimately sacked, leaving Tracey devastated. Fi returns to The Vic during a celebration of Tracey's time working there, but she wonders why they are prolonging Tracey's agony, though Shirley says it is bringing in customers. Tracey does not turn up, though, and the customers decide to boycott the pub until she is reinstated. Fi meets The Vic landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), when he returns from Bulgaria. Mick later has a meeting with Fi and she tells him that The Vic is a good pub and that it has charm, just like him, and she says that they need a permanent replacement for Whitney Carter (Shona McGarty), who has left. Fi later suggests to Mick that they should have more younger staff to boost customers and suggests a two-for-one Father's Day meal for the Vic.
