Speaking in January though he said that the state of the Vale Park pitch was \"unacceptable for a professional football club in League Two\". On 9 March, he saved a first-half penalty from Mansfield Town's Nicky Ajose to inspire a 2\u20131 win, in what was John Askey's first victory as \"Valiants\" boss. He went on to save a Kieran Agard penalty at Milton Keynes Dons on 20 April \u2013 his fifth penalty save of the campaign \u2013 and then saved the striker's shot from the rebound to help secure a 1\u20131 draw.

It was a closely fought match in which Carlisle United matched Everton for much of the match. James Vaughan scored the opening tally against the run of play in the twelfth minute, but Carlisle's Kevan Hurst equalised only six minutes later. Carlisle nearly took the lead in the seventieth minute, but the Danny Livesey attempt was partially saved by Tim Howard and rang the crossbar. Everton were finally able to take hold of the match in the eight-second minute when Phil Neville knocked in the winner. Leighton Baines sealed the match with a penalty shot that had been earned by substitute Kieran Agard in the fifth minute of extra time. For the Fourth Round, Everton were drawn to face Birmingham City, who won their third round replay with Nottingham Forest. Everton were unable to duplicate the FA Cup run of the previous season as they were eliminated by Birmingham City, 2\u20131, in front of their home crowd at Goodison Park.

Emmanuel-Thomas scored both goals as Bristol City beat Doncaster Rovers in an FA Cup 3rd round replay at Ashton Gate, before scoring in back-to-back games against Scunthorpe United and Fleetwood Town.
