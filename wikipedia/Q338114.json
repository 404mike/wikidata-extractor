A republican in the early 1870s, he later became a leader in the radical challenge to Whig control of the Liberal Party, making a number of important contributions, including the legislation increasing democracy in 1883\u20131885, his support of the growing labour and feminist movements and his prolific writings on international affairs.\nTouted as a future prime minister, his aspirations to higher political office were effectively terminated in 1885 after a notorious and well-publicised divorce case.\nHis disgrace and the alignment of Joseph Chamberlain with the Conservatives both greatly weakened the radical cause.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people educated at Westminster School", "response": ["*Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet (1843\u20131911), Liberal and Radical statesman"]}, {"page": "Charles Dilke (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet (1843\u20131911),  a prominent Liberal politician in Britain"]}, {"page": "W.

Hobhouse and Political Argument in England 1880-1914 (1983). p. 54 In terms of his political and philosophical views, Hobhouse was Gladstonian; a devoted follower of the philosopher John Stuart Mill; and an admirer of John Morley, Bradlaugh; and Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet. These influences led him to various feminist, democratic and secularist political stances. He often proposed republican and democratic motions at debating societies while he was at school."]}]}}
