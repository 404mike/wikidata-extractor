A republican in the early 1870s, he later became a leader in the radical challenge to Whig control of the Liberal Party, making a number of important contributions, including the legislation increasing democracy in 1883\u20131885, his support of the growing labour and feminist movements and his prolific writings on international affairs.\nTouted as a future prime minister, his aspirations to higher political office were effectively terminated in 1885 after a notorious and well-publicised divorce case.\nHis disgrace and the alignment of Joseph Chamberlain with the Conservatives both greatly weakened the radical cause.", "link_mentions": {}}}
