In 1938, when Charles ffoulkes retired as Master of the Armouries at the Tower of London, Mann requested permission from the trustees of the Wallace Collection to apply for the post which was part time and virtually unpaid. He was successful in his application and worked as Master of the Armouries alongside his work at the Wallace Collection. Early on in the post, which again he held until his premature death, Mann had to arrange for the evacuation of the contents of the Armouries to various locations in Beaconsfield and Wales when World War II broke out. In the obituary for The British Academy and published in The Burlington Magazine, Sir Francis Watson, Mann\u2019s successor at the Wallace, wrote of Mann\u2019s exceptional work at the Tower of London, creating \u201chis most lasting monument\u201d. Watson described how \u201cDuring his term of office he (Mann) was able to make some remarkable additions to the collections, his two most notable purchases being the cream of the W. R.
