He was a popular, socialist Irish republican; \"a vice-president of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, he was a proponent of land redistribution.\" He was Gaelic League envoy to the United States from 1910 to 1912, and he supported the striking dockers in Sligo in 1913.O'Flanagan was friends with many of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising and was vocal in his admiration for the sacrifice made by the men of Easter Week. He was active in reorganising the Sinn F\u00e9in party after the Rising. He was the main driving force behind the Election of the Snows in North Roscommon in February 1917, when Count Plunkett won a by-election as an independent candidate.At the Sinn F\u00e9in Convention in October 1917, \u00c9amon de Valera was elected president. Along with Arthur Griffith, O'Flanagan was elected joint Vice-President, a position he held from 1917 to 1923 and again from 1930 to 1931. He campaigned for the imprisoned Griffith in the East Cavan by-election in 1918, and was instrumental in securing the seat. For this O'Flanagan was suspended by the Bishop; he went on to work full-time for Sinn F\u00e9in and was the main platform speaker and campaigner during the 1918 election.While O'Flanagan was Acting President of Sinn F\u00e9in in 1920, he corresponded publicly with David Lloyd George about peace moves, to the upset of his colleagues. He went on to hold meetings with Lloyd George and Edward Carson in January 1921, and reported British terms to \u00c9amon de Valera on his return. He was President of Sinn F\u00e9in from 1933 to 1935.\nO'Flanagan travelled extensively throughout his lifetime, spending many years in the United States, and several months in Rome. After five months as Republican Envoy to Australia he was deported in 1923. O'Flanagan, James Larkin and Frank Ryan were considered the best open-air orators of the twentieth century.He was suspended from the priesthood for many years because of his political beliefs and attitudes. In later years he edited the 1837 Ordnance Survey letters and prepared sets for institutions and universities; in the 1930s he worked on a series of County Histories, and ten volumes were published by the time of his death. He died in 1942, was given a State Funeral, and is buried in the Republican Plot in Glasnevin Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "response": ["|Fr.

At that Ard Fheis, Griffith resigned the presidency of Sinn F\u00e9in in favour of de Valera; he and Fr. Michael O'Flanagan were elected Vice-Presidents. The leaders of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) sought a rapprochement with Griffith over the British threat of conscription, which both parties condemned, but Griffith refused unless the IPP embraced his more radical and subversive ideals, a suggestion which John Dillon, a leader of the IPP rubbished as unrealistic, although it would ultimately mean the defeat and dissolution of the IPP after the election in December 1918."]}, {"page": "Christian socialism", "response": ["Leo XIII's opinions on socialism were moderated in an encyclical issued by Pope Pius XI on 15 May 1931 Quadragesimo anno, wherein Pius describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism. Pius XI called upon true socialism to distance itself from totalitarian communism as a matter of clarity and also as a matter of principle. Communists were accused of attempting to overthrow all existing civil society. It was argued that Christian socialism, if allied to communism, was deemed to be an oxymoron because of this. Pius XI famously wrote at the time that \"no one can be at the same time a good Catholic and a true socialist\". Nonetheless, prominent Catholic socialists did exist during Pope Pius XI's era such as Dorothy Day in the United States (though she later advocated distributism) and Father Michael O'Flanagan (who was suspended for his beliefs) in Ireland. Pius XI also clarified that a Catholic was free to vote for the Labour Party, the British affiliate of the Socialist International. Later, in 1937, Pius XI rejected atheistic communism in an encyclical entitled Divini Redemptoris as \"a system full of errors and sophisms\", with a \"pseudo-ideal of justice, equality, and fraternity\" and \"a certain false mysticism\", and contrasted it with a humane society (civitas humana)."]}, {"page": "George Noble Plunkett", "response": ["He was re-elected in the 1918 general election and joined the First D\u00e1il, in which he served briefly as Ceann Comhairle.

The protest which was widely reported in the newspapers, continued for ten weeks until Christmas Eve 1915.In October Fr O'Flanagan was transferred by his Bishop to the parish of Crossna, County Roscommom. His parishioners saw this as punishment for his involvement with the bog dispute and did not take kindly to the move. They locked up the church at Cliffony and refused to hand over the key to the new curate, Fr McHugh. This dispute continued until Christmas Day 1915.
