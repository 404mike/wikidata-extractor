He joined Haverfordwest County, also gaining employment as a computer programmer, but a number of injuries to Cardiff's goalkeepers saw the club re-sign Sander on non-contract terms. He played in five matches, including becoming the first Cardiff goalkeeper to save two penalties in the same match during a 1\u20131 draw with Walsall in April 1986, before being released for a second time as the club suffered relegation. He later spent more than four seasons with Barry Town, making over 100 appearances, before playing for Aberystwyth Town."]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["| GK || Lee Smelt ||   ||  ", "| GK || Lee Smelt|| Peterborough United || "]}]}}
