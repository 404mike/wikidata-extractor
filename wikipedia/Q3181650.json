Blink Bonny's presence was credited for attracting an enormous number of people, including the writers Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins, to Doncaster, all of them reportedly anxious to see \"so extraordinary an animal.\" She started 5/4 favourite but after leading briefly in the straight she finished only fourth of the eleven runners behind Imperieuse, having been given a poor ride by Charlton. It was widely believed that Charlton had deliberately \"pulled\" the filly (prevented her from winning) on the orders of the bookmaker John Jackson. The ill-feeling came to a head when Blink Bonny, carrying a ten pounds higher weight, ran in the Park Hill Stakes a day later over the same course and distance. She won easily by six lengths in a time that was two seconds faster than that set by Imperieuse in winning the St Leger. The crowd, believing that the result proved that Blink Bonny had been pulled in the classic attacked the horse's connections. Only the intervention of the former prize-fighters John Gully and Tom Sayers. prevented \"Little Jack\" Charlton from being \"torn to pieces\" by angry spectators. An estimated two thousand people became involved in the disturbances and Blink Bonny herself had to be escorted from the scene by an impromptu bodyguard formed by former police officers.

William Day, the trainer's son, writing some years later, gave a different account.

With Bill Scott injured, Frank Butler took the ride, and Cotherstone started the 4/6 favourite against eight opponents. His odds had drifted out from 1/2 just before the race as a great number of bets were placed on his stable companion Prizefighter. Prizefighter set off in front, set a very strong pace and was still leading in the straight. Cotherstone moved up to contest the lead together with the outsider Nutwith and the three colts raced together throughout the final quarter of a mile. Cotherstone held a slight lead inside the final furlong, but Nutwith, under a strong ride from Job Marson, caught him in the last strides and won by a head with Prizefighter a neck away in third. There was considerable anger after the race among followers of the Scott stable who felt that the race tactics had not suited either of their runners. There were also allegations that Frank Butler, had pulled Cotherstone (held him back to prevent him from winning) on the orders of John Gully, who had wagered heavily on Prizefighter."]}, {"page": "St. Giles (horse)", "response": ["St. Giles was a dark chestnut horse bred by Mr Cattle, a farmer from Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire.

Gully, who moved the horse to the stable of a trainer named Sykes at Hambledon, aimed the horse for the St Leger at Doncaster and wagered heavily on his success. He reportedly stood to make more than \u00a340,000 if the colt won, and the potential losers included unscrupulous gamblers and bookmakers such as Robert Ridsdale and William Crockford. At Doncaster, the start of the St Leger was chaotic with numerous false starts: according to one source there were twenty-seven of them and the race was run in near darkness. When the starter, Mr. Lockwood finally allowed the race to begin, a filly named Matilda was well in front of the other runners, while Mameluke, who had become increasingly upset by the situation and was facing in the wrong direction, was left at least sixty yards behind. Mameluke made up the ground but had to be taken round the outside of the field by his rider Sam Chifney as rival jockeys attempted to block him. He moved up to challenge the filly in the straight, but Matilda pulled ahead again and won by a length. It was later revealed that Lockwood, who was subsequently dismissed, had been bribed to engineer the start so as to ruin Mameluke's chances. It was also reported that several of the jockeys had been bribed to delay and disrupt the proceedings as much as possible. Gully attempted to recoup some of his losses by challenging Matilda's owners to a match race two days later, but his offer was declined."]}, {"page": "Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil", "response": ["The Sketcher employed many prominent artists, including Louis Buvelot, John Gully, political cartoonist Tom Carrington and illustrator Julian Ashton.

Two weeks later Wood issued a challenge for \"The Whip\", a silver trophy which was said to incorporate hairs from the tail and mane of Eclipse. When no horse appeared to oppose Camarine, Wood was able to claim the trophy without a race. At the Houghton meeting on 1 November Camarine was scheduled to run a match race in which she was set to concede nineteen pounds to John Gully's St Leger winner Margrave over ten furlongs.
