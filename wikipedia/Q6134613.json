The follow-up of this revelation explored Michelle's secret relationship with Den prior to her giving birth to their daughter, Vicki (Scarlett Alice Johnson). Other storylines with Michelle have included a problematic marriage with her first husband Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt); helping nurse her aunt Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) back to health following the latter's rape ordeal from her boss James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde); briefly falling out with Sharon after the truth of Vicki's parentage and Michelle's dalliance with Den is exposed; enduring a marriage breakdown with her second spouse Danny Whiting (Saul Jephcott); and getting stalked by her ex-boyfriend Jack Woodman (James Gilbey).", "As time goes on, Michelle finds herself involved in another marriage\u2014this time with a computer salesman named Danny Whiting (Saul Jephcott). This first emerged when Whiting told Michelle that his previous marriage was over after being unable to make amends with his ex-wife. Michelle soon plans to move to Newcastle with Whiting, but she ends up changing her mind; Whiting, though, appears unwilling to accept her decision. Michelle moves in with Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), a lecturer who persuades Michelle to resume her studies and enroll at university. Michelle and Rachel become inseparable, and rumours about their sexuality prompt Michelle to start dating Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock), a fellow single parent. Some of the Albert Square residents, including Arthur, view their interracial relationship with concern. Later that year, Clyde is falsely accused of murdering local publican Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). With the police closing in, Clyde resolves to leave the square with his son Kofi (Marcel Smith) and tells Michelle about this; she later decides to go with him and take Vicki along in the process. Their getaway fails and Clyde is imprisoned for three months. He is eventually exonerated, but by then Michelle has already moved on to his companion Jack Woodman (James Gilbey) during the events of Clyde's prison stint; Clyde ends his relationship with Michelle after catching her in bed with Woodman."]}, {"page": "Clyde Tavernier", "response": ["Clyde discovers Eddie's bloody body in the square and unwittingly picks up the knife that has been used to kill him. Panicking, Clyde leaves the scene and disposes of the murder weapon, but is seen by the real murderer, Nick Cotton (John Altman), who proceeds to frame Clyde for the deed. With a clear motive and a key witness, Clyde finds it difficult to convince anyone of his innocence. Clyde feels that he was the victim of a racist conspiracy and sensing his imminent arrest he decides to go 'on the run' with Kofi. Michelle sticks by him and she and her daughter Vicki Fowler (Samantha Leigh Martin) leave Walford with Clyde, with the hope of starting a new life together in France. Their bid for freedom is not to be as Clyde is apprehended in Portsmouth before he can leave the country; he is subsequently imprisoned. He only secures release several weeks later when a witness, Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) comes forward and identifies Nick as Eddie's real killer. Upon Clyde's release, his relationship with Michelle abruptly ends when he catches her in bed with another man, Jack Woodman (James Gilbey). The Taverniers are visited by Gidea Thompson (Si\u00e2n Martin), a friend of Jules' family back in Trinidad. Clyde and Gidea grow close and embark on a relationship, forcing Jules to admit Gidea is his granddaughter from an adulterous affair he had in his 20s, meaning the pair are cousins. Gidea wants to break things off with Clyde, but he persuades her they can still have a relationship.
