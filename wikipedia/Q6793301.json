He was born in Glasgow. He was educated at The Glasgow Academy where he was a pupil from 1928-36. In later life, he served as an Honorary Governor of the school.\nAfter serving in World War II, with the 7th Cameronians, he became a radio broadcaster, also editing the 1946 anthology Modern Scottish Poetry, and writing music criticism. He later was Programme Controller at Border Television.\nIn 1962, Scottish composer Thea Musgrave set five of his children's poems in Lowland Scots to music for voice and piano, in a song cycle called A Suite o Bairnsangs.His Collected Poems (1974) drew on 12 published collections. He wrote a number of other books, including one on Robert Burns and a seminal biography of the composer Francis George Scott and mid-twentieth century Scottish classical music, entitled Francis George Scott and the Scottish Renaissance (1980).\nDr Lindsay was Director of the Scottish Civic Trust, President of the Association for Scottish Literary Studies from 1989 to 1993, and was Honorary Secretary-General of Europa Nostra.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Maurice Lindsay (1918\u20132009, S)"]}, {"page": "History of Scotland", "response": ["Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed Hugh MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch and Sydney Goodsir Smith.

George Mackay Brown from Orkney, and Iain Crichton Smith from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Muriel Spark, with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean, and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett. A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, this time led by a group of Glasgow writers associated with critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum and editor Peter Kravitz. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels, often overtly political, that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth, particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Carol Ann Duffy, who was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post."]}, {"page": "Scottish literature", "response": ["Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch and Sydney Goodsir Smith.
