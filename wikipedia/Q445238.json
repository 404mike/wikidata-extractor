The tall, Swedish Ingrid Bergman was inconsistent with Aylward's small stature, dark hair and cockney accent. The struggles of Aylward and her family to effect her initial trip to China were skipped over in favour of the plot device of her employer \"condescending to write to 'his old friend' Jeannie Lawson\", and Aylward's dangerous, complicated travels across Russia and China were reduced to \"a few rude soldiers\", after which \"Hollywood's train delivered her neatly to Tsientsin.\"Sam Wellman.
