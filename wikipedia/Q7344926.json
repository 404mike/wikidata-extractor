She was assisted by their children when they were able. They lived in Glasgow, where Robert worked in a bank, and their holidays were spent back in Ayrshire. Elizabeth's interest lay in documenting and discovering fossils and she trained her children to document their findings too. Robert co-founded the Natural History Society of Glasgow where much of their findings were exhibited. It was traditional that men took the lead and Mrs Robert Gray was a name she used. Robert would present and take credit for his family's work. At the time you needed to publish papers to join learned societies. Elizabeth's specimens were frequently used at the start of meetings of the Natural History Society of Glasgow but with poor attribution that implied that her husband or she were possibly those responsible. However, in 1866 the first Gray collection was given to the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow by the two of them."]}, {"page": "William Evans (ornithologist)", "response": ["William also spent some later years with his uncle at Buckstone Farm near Mortonhall, Edinburgh (the farm now giving rise to the name of one of Edinburgh's suburbs).

William was then sent to the Edinburgh Institution (now Stewart's Melville College) for further schooling. At age 17 (in 1868) he was apprenticed as an actuary in the Scottish Widows Fund. By 1892 he had reached the level of Assistant Actuary to the Fund, but had to retire due to ill-health. Curiously, his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1884 is minuted as being due to his actuarial skills rather than naturalist skills.http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8384146 His proposers were Robert Gray, Thomas Bond Sprague, John MacGregor McCandlish, and Sir Peter Redford Scott."]}, {"page": "William Smith Greenfield", "response": ["In 1886, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
