This would come to be known as \"Bloody Sunday\". Hardy escaped death because he was not at his residence when the would-be assassins arrived. The previous evening, Hardy had taken part in a series of raids that led to the capture of prominent republicans Dick McKee and Peadar Clancy, who had done much of the planning around \"Bloody Sunday\". Hardy later prevented Clancy from escaping by slipping into a group of prisoners being transferred out of Dublin Castle and both prisoners were later killed in disputed circumstances by the auxiliaries guarding them. Between 13 and 15 February 1921, Captain William L King would be tried by court-martial and cleared of the allegation of the extrajudicial killing of two other IRA members in what would become known as the \"Drumcondra Affair\". Dublin Castle's Under Secretary Sir Alfred Cope later speculated that Hardy may have influenced other witnesses in the inquiry."]}, {"page": "Sir Alfred 'Andy' Cope", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Cope"]}, {"page": "Alfred William Cope", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Cope"]}]}}
