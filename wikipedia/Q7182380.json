From 2005  the voice of Phil Sayer was heard on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines. When he died, in 2016, The New York Times, one of many newspapers worldwide to report his death, said \"Mr. Sayer\u2019s was not the only voice cautioning passengers to \u201cmind the gap,\u201d but it is arguably the most familiar one.\" For 15 years before that, the voice on the Piccadilly line was that of Archers actor Tim Bentinck , but is now Julie Berry's. Another announcement was recorded by voice artist Emma Clarke. At least 10 stations were supplied with announcers manufactured by PA Communications Ltd. of Milton Keynes. The recorded voice is that of Keith Wilson, their industrial sales manager at the time (May 1990). It can still be heard, at Paddington for example. It is Keith Wilson's voice that can be heard in the background of a scene in the Bond film Skyfall."]}, {"page": "BBC North West Tonight", "response": ["* Phil Sayer"]}, {"page": "Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby", "response": ["*Phil Sayer broadcaster "]}, {"page": "Sayer", "response": ["* Phil Sayer (1953-2016), British voice artist"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Phil Sayer, 62, voice artist (\"Mind the gap\")."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2016", "response": ["*Phil Sayer, 62, British voice artist, oesophageal cancer.London Underground's 'mind the gap' man Phil Sayer dies"]}]}}
