He is best known for his critical analyses of Marxist thought, especially his three-volume history, Main Currents of Marxism (1976). In his later work, Kolakowski increasingly focused on religious questions. In his 1986 Jefferson Lecture, he asserted that \"[w]e learn history not in order to know how to behave or how to succeed, but to know who we are\".Due to his criticism of Marxism and of the Communist state system, Ko\u0142akowski was effectively exiled from Poland in 1968. He spent most of the remainder of his career at All Souls College, Oxford. Despite being in exile, Ko\u0142akowski was a major inspiration for the Solidarity movement that flourished in Poland in the 1980s and helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to his being described by Bronislaw Geremek as the \"awakener of human hopes\". He was awarded both the MacArthur Fellowship and Erasmus Prize in 1983, the 2003 Kluge Prize, and the 2007 Jerusalem Prize.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 17", "response": ["*  2009   \u2013 Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, Polish historian and philosopher (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Ontology", "response": ["* Leszek Ko\u0142akowski"]}, {"page": "October 23", "response": ["*  1927   \u2013 Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, Polish-English historian and philosopher (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "Philosopher", "response": ["The John W.

Underground copies of his books and essays shaped the opinions of the Polish intellectual opposition. His 1971 essay Theses on Hope and Hopelessness, which suggested that self-organised social groups could gradually expand the spheres of civil society in a totalitarian state, helped inspire the dissident movements of the 1970s that led to the creation of Solidarity and provided a philosophical underpinning for the movement.", "According to Ko\u0142akowski, a proletarian revolution has never occurred anywhere, as the October Revolution in Russia had nothing to do with Marxism in his view because it was achieved under the \"Peace, Land and Bread\" slogan.
