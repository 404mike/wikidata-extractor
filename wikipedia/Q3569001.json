In one of Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead, Pluto questions Protesilaus, the first Greek hero killed in the Trojan War, who wishes to return to the world of the living. \"You are then in love with life?\" Pluto asks. \"Such lovers we have here in plenty; but they love an object, which none of them can obtain.\" Protesilaus explains, like an Orpheus in reverse, that he has left behind a young bride whose memory even the Lethe's waters of forgetting have not erased from him. Pluto assures him that death will reunite them someday, but Protesilaus argues that Pluto himself should understand love and its impatience, and reminds the king of his grant to Orpheus and to Alcestis, who took her husband's place in death and then was permitted at the insistence of Heracles to return to him. When Persephone intercedes for the dead warrior, Pluto grants the request at once, though allowing only one day for the reunion.Lucian, Dialogues of the Dead 23 (English translation from the 1820 edition of William Tooke; Jan Kott, The Eating of the Gods (Northwestern University Press, 1987), pp. 95\u201397.

Russell, In a Club Corner: The Monologue of a Man Who Might Have Been Sociable (Houghton, Mifflin, 1890), pp. 78\u201379. The dialogue has also been seen as a burlesque of domesticity; Betrand A.

In the meantime Pitt had become alarmed at the opposition to his Russian policy in parliament, Burke and Fox both uttering powerful speeches against the restoration of Oczakow to the Porte, and early in April 1791 a messenger was hastily despatched to St. Petersburg to keep back the ultimatum which Whitworth had on 27 March been ordered to present to the empress. His relations with the Russian court were now for a short period considerably strained.

In 1704, upon succeeding to his mother's property in Ireland upon the death of his elder brother Edmund, he took Aland as an additional surname..There are two older alternative theories. William Tooke suggests that Fortescue Aland adopted his mother's surname in her honour (see ), while the Dictionary of National Biography (1885) states that it was Fortescue Aland's father who took his wife's surname upon their marriage (see  (\"DNB\")). It is unclear whether he was educated at home or attended a public school,Tooke surmises that Fortescue Aland attended the University of Oxford as later in life he was conferred an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) by the University on the strength of once having been a member of it (Tooke, pp. 173\u2013174), but the DNB states \"he was probably not educated there\" (DNB, p. 216, citing ). but at any rate he studied law at the Middle Temple in 1688 and was called to the Bar in 1695.

This was the last occasion on which a judge failed to have a patent renewed on a monarch's accession to the throne.. The University of Oxford conferred on Fortescue Aland an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) by diploma on 4 May 1733. Tooke notes that the writers Francis Gregor and George Hicks said Fortescue Aland had \"sat in the supreme courts of judicature with applause, and to general satisfaction; that he deservedly had the name of one perfectly read in the northern and saxon literature\".Tooke, p. 182."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|William Tooke||05/06/1783||? 29 January 1744 \u2013 17 November 1820", "|William Tooke||12/03/1818||22 November 1777 \u2013 20 September 1863"]}, {"page": "William Beloe", "response": ["One of Beloe's publisher commissions was to translate Samuel Parr's preface to Bellendenus into English, a piece of work that impressed Richard Porson.
