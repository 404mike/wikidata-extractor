This connection to Macmillan, via his wife, has been seen as one of the reasons why the police did not investigate the death of Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire, who died in the presence of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. The duke was Lady Dorothy's brother, and it is thought the police were wary of drawing press attention to her while she was being unfaithful."]}, {"page": "Lady Caroline Faber", "response": ["Lady (Ann) Caroline Faber (29 August 1923Court Circular, The Times (30 Aug. 1923), p. 11. \u2013 14 September 2016) was the daughter of Harold Macmillan (created Earl of Stockton in 1984) and his wife, Lady Dorothy Macmillan.\"Faber, (Ann) Caroline\", Debrett's People of Today (1 November 2000).

However, her successor, Lady Dorothy Macmillan, so keen a horticulturalist that she sometimes gardened at night, removed yellow and white flowers planted by Lady Avon and replaced them with roses of \"normal colour\".Alistair Horne (1989) Macmillan: Volume II 1957\u20131986. Even so, Lady Dorothy, who, like Lady Avon, did not like Chequers much, complained to her daughter-in-law that \"they would never let me plant anything ... they want me to plant pansies\" (\"and she didn't like pansies\": Viscountess Macmillan of Ovenden, quoted in Booth & Haste, op.cit.)  One episode at Chequers attracted considerable publicity.  In January 1956 Lady Avon politely requested the occupant of a farm worker's cottage on the estate to hang her washing where it could not be seen by visitors.  Although it seems that the washing may have been hung across a lime walk, beyond the boundary of the cottage garden itself,Ann Fleming, diary 13 January 1956: The Letters of Ann Fleming, ed. Mark Amory (1985) the story was taken up by the Daily Mirror as an alleged example of Lady Avon's high-handedness.  Coming shortly after attacks in the press on Eden's leadership, the timing was unfortunate.", "Lady Avon was the youngest wife of an incumbent prime minister in the twentieth century. She was only 36 when her husband resigned, and was widowed at 56. She has outlived five later Prime Ministerial spouses and witnessed the administrations of 13 subsequent prime ministers. By contrast, Lady Dorothy Macmillan was 57 when her husband succeeded Eden and 63 when he resigned, dying just three years later, her husband outliving her by 20 years.Booth & Haste, op.cit. As such Lady Avon has enjoyed unusual longevity for a prime ministerial spouse, contributing, for example, to a television documentary by Cherie Blair in 2005 about prime ministers' wivesMarried to the Prime Minister (Channel 4), 6 December 2005, based on Cherie Booth & Cate Haste (2004) The Goldfish Bowl and to a three-part series the following year marking the 50th anniversary of Suez.
