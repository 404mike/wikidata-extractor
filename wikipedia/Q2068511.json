The song appeared on a cassette compilation in April 1990 representing Suede's first official release.Barnett, p. 37 After a series of gigs with an unreliable drum machine, Suede decided to recruit a full-time drummer. Justin Welch briefly fulfilled the role, though he only lasted six weeks before joining the Crawley band Spitfire.Harris, p. 36 He did, though, stay long enough to record two songs with the band, which were set to be released as the \"Be My God\"/\"Art\" single on RML Records. The band was dissatisfied with the result, and most of the 500 copies pressed were destroyed.Harris, p. 36-37 Suede placed another advert seeking a replacement. To the band's surprise, it was answered by the Smiths\u2019 former drummer, Mike Joyce. He ultimately turned down the job as he felt Suede still had to forge their own identity. He felt that by being in a band that had similarities to the Smiths, he would have done them more harm than good.Barnett, p. 45 In June 1990, Suede found a permanent drummer, Simon Gilbert, through Ricky Gervais, who would later become a household name for co-writing and starring in the TV series The Office. Both worked at the University of London Union (ULU). After hearing the demo and realising the band did not have a drummer, Gilbert asked to audition.Barnett, p. 50-51", "*Simon Gilbert \u2013 drums (1991\u20132003, 2010\u2013present)", " bar:Simon text:\"Simon Gilbert\""]}, {"page": "Brett Anderson", "response": ["In his teens, Anderson played guitar for garage bands such as The Pigs and Geoff, the latter featuring future Suede bassist Mat Osman. In the late 1980s, while a student at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College, London, Anderson and Osman formed Suede with Anderson's girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, soon recruiting guitarist Bernard Butler through an advertisement in the NME. After they had received temporary percussional help from former Smiths drummer Mike Joyce, in 1991 Simon Gilbert joined as their official drummer. It was around this time that Frischmann left Anderson for Blur frontman Damon Albarn, which created an early rift in the burgeoning Britpop scene of the early 1990s. After missing too many rehearsals and flaunting her relationship with Albarn while still living with Anderson, Frischmann was fired from the group, going on to front Elastica."]}, {"page": "Suede (album)", "response": ["The record was produced by Ed Buller who the band had met through Nude Records' owner Saul Galpern. Both had worked together at Island Records. The band chose to work with Buller not based on his CV but more on a collective liking of him based on a shared interest of music they liked growing up. The band felt that this mutual interest would help shape their musical direction. Lead singer Brett Anderson said: \"It wasn't so much us attaching ourselves to his CV, it was more kind of like where we were going to go with [the band].\" In terms of writing for the album, Anderson said they had a structural way of doing it. Guitarist Bernard Butler would write guitar parts and melodies mostly on his own. He would then play these in the rehearsal room with bassist Mat Osman and drummer Simon Gilbert playing along. Anderson would then create vocal lines, which he would work on at home changing them to lyrics. These early recordings were done on a cassette recorder rather than a 4-track recorder. 4-track recorders would later be used during recording sessions for the album. During the early recordings, Butler said he was never fully aware of what lyrics Anderson was actually singing in rehearsals or at gigs until much later on. He was more focused on the melodies he was writing himself, saying: \"I just always had the feeling that, if he's happy, I'm happy... if it's working, it's working and just go with it.\"", "*Simon Gilbert \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Coming Up (album)", "response": ["As opposed to the previous album which followed a stringent pattern of Butler composing music for Anderson's lyrics, Coming Up was a more collaborative project. Anderson stated: \"Coming Up was more of a meritocracy \u2013 if something was good enough, it didn't matter what the source was.\" Songs such as \"By the Sea\" and \"She\" required the use of keyboards. Faced with the problem as to how to play them live, Suede recruited Simon Gilbert's cousin Neil Codling, who made his debut at a fan-club gig in January 1996. Buller has stated that the reason why the album has a much better sound than the previous albums is that he had minimal involvement in the mixing process, mixing only two songs. Buller credits much of the album's success to Dave Bascombe, who mixed the majority of the songs. According to Buller, having an outside observer mix the record with \"fresh ears\" enhances the overall production quality. Bascombe's input on \"Trash\" was crucial, as it was his idea to speed up the vocals. One of Suede's popular B-sides \"Young Men\" was left off the album, as Buller felt it was \"too dark\" and not as \"poppy [and] in your face\" as other songs on the record.", "*Simon Gilbert \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Dog Man Star", "response": ["In early 1994, when Suede were about to release the standalone single \"Stay Together\", the morale within the group was at an all-time low. Butler's father had died just as the band were about to begin their second American tour. The first week of the tour was cancelled, and Suede flew back to London from New York. When the tour did resume, Butler\u2014not only recently bereaved but now engaged to his fianc\u00e9e Elisa\u2014distanced himself from the rest of the band far more than before. According to Butler, \"they got really resentful of the fact that they were on tour with someone who didn't want to party\". He even travelled separately, either alone, by taxi, or on the tour bus of support act the Cranberries. Then, in Atlanta, Suede suffered the ignominy of having to open for the Cranberries, who had become a bigger draw, thanks to their recent hit \"Linger\". The band agreed to let the Cranberries go on last in three places, given that they were picking up airplay; Anderson said the \"whole rivalry thing was blown out of all proportion.\" By the time of their arrival in New York, Suede had had enough, and the last few dates were cancelled. According to drummer Simon Gilbert, Butler was becoming intolerable and impossible to work with, and the band could not function together any longer. To record Suede's next album Anderson moved to Highgate, north London, and began to write lyrics while living in a secluded flat; a time which is detailed in the band biography Love and Poison.", "In June 2011, Suede released remastered and expanded editions of their previous five studio albums. Released in chronological order each week. The expanded version includes the original 12 tracks remastered. Additional bonus material includes demos, all b-sides from the singles \"Stay Together\", \"We Are the Pigs\" and \"The Wild Ones\". Missing are the b-sides to \"New Generation\", which featured replacement guitarist Richard Oakes. Also included are six extra tracks; notable songs include the original unedited versions of \"The Wild Ones\" and \"The Asphalt World\", and \"La Puissance\", a version of \"The Power\" sung in French. The DVD features song-films which were specially created for the Dog Man Star tour and previously-unseen footage of the band playing at the Casino de Paris and at the Fnac, Les Halles in Paris on 27 November 1993. The bonus DVD material features a 2011 interview with Anderson and Butler including contemporary film inserts from Simon Gilbert. The booklet contains all the lyrics, hand-written lyric drafts and previously unpublished photos of the band. There is also a specially-written note by Anderson; in it he says: \"If I could choose to be remembered for just one musical document it would be this.\" The reissue is notable for having no content featuring Oakes. It was revealed by Suede's biographer David Barnett that Butler made an \"11th hour\" request that all traces of Oakes - B-sides, live footage and promotional videos for the singles be erased from the reissue.
