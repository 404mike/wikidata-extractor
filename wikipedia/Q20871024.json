Influenced by Chartism in his youth, Shorrocks was always involved in trade union activity, and in 1860 he joined the recently founded Manchester Society of Journeymen Tailors.  The society suffered from low membership and a lack of funds; Shorrocks was elected as its secretary in 1863, and attempted to increase its activity.In 1865, the Manchester Society tried to negotiate an agreed price list with employers, but faced hostility and was unable to reach agreement.  Shorrocks organised a strike which quickly achieved most of the union's aims.  Enthused by this, he called a national conference of local tailors' societies, held in Manchester in March 1866.  The conference attracted a large number of delegates from around the UK, and the large majority formed the Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Tailors (ASJT), with Shorrocks as General Secretary.  Shorrocks also negotiated an agreement to work in co-ordination with the rival London Operative Tailors' Association.  He led the ASJT through a lock-out in Manchester in 1868, during which he was charged with conspiracy under the Combination of Workmen Act 1859, but was found not guilty.In 1866, Shorrocks was a founder of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council (MSTC), and he supported W. H. Wood in calling the first Trades Union Congress (TUC), held in Manchester in 1868.  He acted as the secretary of this first congress, also playing a prominent role in the 1869 congress, after which he was elected to the committee organised to put together a public statement of the TUC's resolutions.  He attended most congresses until 1881, and served on the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC in 1873, the Standing Orders Committee from 1877 to 1879 and in 1881, and as vice-president in 1880.During the late 1860s, Shorrocks was a supporter of the International Workingmen's Association, and was prominent in its Manchester and Salford branches, although neither existed long.  He subsequently became associated with more mainstream Liberal-Labour positions.Shorrocks was elected as secretary of the MSTC in 1877, serving until 1883, by which point he was in poor health.  Despite this, he remained secretary of the ASJT until his death, early in 1886.  One of his daughters later married T. A. Flynn, who served as General Secretary of the Tailors in the early 20th-century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester Trades Union Council", "response": ["Following a trade union conference in Sheffield in July 1866 called to discuss the use of the lockout weapon by employers, two delegates from the Manchester Typographical Association, William Henry Wood and Samuel Caldwell Nicholson, convened the inaugural meeting of the Manchester and Salford Trades Union Council in October 1866. A month later Wood was elected secretary and Nicholson president. Wood and Nicholson were Conservative working men. Other members of the council included the radicals Peter Shorrocks of the Tailors, William MacDonald of the Operative Housepainters and Malcolm MacLeod, an engineer. When the Council decided to avoid identifying with any political movement, the radicals set up the Trade Unionists Political Association with MacDonald as president and MacLeod as secretary. One of the Trades Council's first decisions was the proposal to form a court of arbitration.  Set up jointly with the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in 1868, it was short-lived, failing to arbitrate a single case. More significantly in February that year, the council called a national conference of trade unionists which met in June and agreed to form what became the Trades Union Congress.  Woods was elected president and Shorrocks secretary. This soon became the leading national association of trade unions.", "Peter Shorrocks played a leading role in establishing the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and was an active supporter of the International Workingmen's Association, the First International. He succeeded Wood to be secretary from 1877 to 1883. He was followed as secretary by George Davy Kelley, full-time secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers and a member of the General Council of the Manchester Liberal Association. Kelley helped to greatly increase affiliations to the council. Many of the new affiliations were general unions of unskilled workers, a development which Kelley opposed as he felt the organisations would not endure, but they soon came to dominate the council. Despite this, Kelley remained the council's most prominent figure, being elected to Manchester City Council in 1891 as a Liberal-Labour representative.Alan Haworth and Dianne Hayter, Men who made Labour, pp.122-123", ":1877: Peter Shorrocks"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["| Peter ShorrocksManchester TC", "| Peter ShorrocksTailors"]}, {"page": "Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses", "response": ["The union was founded in 1866 when Peter Shorrocks convened a conference in Manchester of local societies of tailors.

By the end of the year, membership of the new Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Tailors was more than 7,000, with the large majority of local societies in England and Ireland signing up, although the Scottish Amalgamated Society of Tailors remained separate.Arthur Marsh, Victoria Ryan and John B.
