He is also known for playing the role of Hansel, in the movie Hansel and Gretel (1987).\nPollard attended the Christ Church C of E School in Finchley, North London, before leaving in 1992. He graduated from the University of Kent, with a degree in radio, film and television. Following his role in Simon and the Witch, Hugh won the role as Hansel in the film Hansel and Gretel (1987). His role in the film saw him team up with Simon and the Witch co-star Nicola Stapleton, who played Gretel.Pollard gave up his acting career, working briefly as a broadcaster for the BBC before gaining a job as a video tape operator. This job has taken him across the world, and involves him creating slow motion replays in sporting events, that include both the Olympics and Wimbledon. He married Nicola Skyes in 1999, and has lived on the shore off Grafham Water, Cambridgeshire since August 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Simon and the Witch", "response": ["Following a one off dramatisation of the first story in 1985 as part of the Children's BBC series Up Our Street, in 1987 the concept was adapted into a television series, starring Elizabeth Spriggs as the Witch, and Hugh Pollard as Simon, which ran for two series.", "With the episode being well received, the BBC felt that the concept had potential to be developed as an ongoing Children's BBC series. In 1987, the books were made into a television series for Children's BBC, consisting of twenty five fifteen minute episodes, starring Elizabeth Spriggs as the Witch, and Hugh Pollard as Simon. Guest stars included Joan Sims and a young Nicola Stapleton.", "Whilst the end of the second series wrapped up a number of the ongoing storylines, it left the door open for a potential third series. However, due both to the age of star Hugh Pollard and several child co stars, as well as Children's BBC reassessing their demographic output in 1990, the second series turned out to be the last."]}, {"page": "Cannon Movie Tales", "response": ["# Hansel and Gretel (1987) aka \"Cannon Movie Tales: Hansel and Gretel\" \u2013 USA (series title); writers: Len Talan and Nancy Weems; director: Len Talan.
