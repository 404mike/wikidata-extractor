He continued a successful legal practice until his retirement due to deafness in 1949. He famously defended the populist Member of Parliament (MP) Horatio Bottomley against fraud charges.In 1910 he entered local politics, when he was elected as a Municipal Reform Party member of the London County Council, representing Hackney North. He remained a member of the council until 1919.In the same year that he entered local government he made his first attempt to gain election to the Commons. He stood as Conservative candidate in the general election held in December, contesting the constituency of Leeds West. The seat was a safe Liberal one, and Jones failed to be elected.\nAt the next general election held in 1918, he was elected as Conservative MP for  Stoke Newington. He held the seat almost continuously until 1945, being briefly unseated from 1923 to 1924. He was knighted in 1928.Sir George Jones was unmarried, and died in a London nursing home in January 1956 aged 81.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Jones (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Jones (1931\u20132013) was an American country music singer and songwriter.", "George Jones may also refer to:", "*George Jones (British politician) (1874\u20131956), Conservative MP for Stoke Newington 1918\u20131923, 1924\u20131945", "*George Jones (Newfoundland politician) (1867\u20131949), Newfoundland mariner, magistrate and politician", "*George Jones (U.S. senator) (1766\u20131838), American Senator from Georgia", "*George Jones (New Zealand politician) (1844\u20131920), New Zealand politician", "*George Jones (Australian politician) (1866\u20131938), New South Wales politician", "*George Jones (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u20131969), English footballer who played for Southampton", "*George Jones (footballer, born 1895) (1895-1970), English footballer for Everton, Wigan Borough and Southport", "*George Jones (footballer, born 1918) (1918\u20131995), English footballer who played for Sheffield United", "*George Jones (footballer, born 1930), Welsh footballer who played for Wrexham", "*George Jones (footballer, born 1945), English footballer who played for Bury", "*George Jones (American football) (born 1973), American running back, played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Jacksonville Jaguars and Cleveland Browns, 1997\u20131999", "*George Jones (Hampshire cricketer) (1907\u20131953), Scottish cricketer", "*George Jones (Surrey cricketer) (1856\u20131936), English cricketer", "*George Jones (sport shooter), British Olympic shooter", "*George Jones (navy chaplain) (1800\u20131870), American Navy chaplain and participant in 1852 Perry Expedition to Japan", "*George Jones (1810\u20131879), English-born American actor and eccentric later known as George, Count Joannes", "*George Jones (RAAF officer) (1896\u20131992), Royal Australian Air Force", "*George Jones (painter) (1786\u20131869), Royal Academy keeper, war painter", "*George Jones (publisher) (1811\u20131891), co-founder of the New York Times", "*George Jones (radio presenter) (born 1944), radio and TV personality, founder member of Clubsound, Belfast", "*George Jones (Canadian admiral) (1895\u20131946), Canadian admiral", "*George Jones, blues musician better known as Little Hat Jones", "*George Jones (journalist), former political editor of The Telegraph", "*George Jones (bishop) (died 1804), Irish Anglican bishop of Kilmore and of Kildare", "*George Jones (bushranger) (1815\u20131844), Australian bushranger"]}, {"page": "George William Henry Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Jones (British politician)"]}, {"page": "George Jones (Conservative politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Jones (British politician)"]}, {"page": "Hackney North (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["| George Jones"]}]}}
