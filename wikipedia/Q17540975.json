Abell enjoyed a prolific cricket record while at Taunton School, where in 2012 he accumulated seven centuries and passed 50 in every innings he played at an average of 193, and he was named 2013 Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year. He made his Somerset first-class debut against Warwickshire in August 2014, scoring 95 in his first innings. He was appointed Somerset's County Championship skipper for the 2017 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club", "response": ["Before the 2017 season, Somerset announced that at the age of 22, Tom Abell would be appointed as club and Championship captain. Somerset made a disastrous start to the Championship, losing four of their first six games of the season. Despite a victory in the seventh game against Yorkshire at Scarborough, Somerset's prospects of survival looked very poor indeed at the halfway mark of the season. A strong draw against Surrey was followed by victories against Warwickshire and Lancashire, and although Somerset lost their penultimate game against Surrey, their fate was still in their own hands. Somerset needed to beat Middlesex in the final match of the year at Taunton with one more bonus point than their opponents to assure safety. Thanks to a 9-wicket match haul from Jack Leach on a turning pitch, and a century from James Hildreth in the second innings, Somerset comfortably beat Middlesex by 231 runs to condemn last year's champions to relegation, and ensure their 10-year run in Division One would continue for another season. Leach finished with 51 wickets, while Craig Overton's 46 wickets were enough to see him called up for that winter's Ashes tour. As a mark of how the batting unit struggled, overseas player Dean Elgar was the only batsman to average over 36 with the bat, and Elgar was absent from the second half of the season. New signing Steven Davies was the leading run scorer with 775. Somerset again enjoyed good success in the One-Day Cup, winning five of seven completed matches and qualifying second in the South Group for a home quarter-final against Nottinghamshire. Somerset lost an incredible game in which 834 runs were scored, falling short of Nottinghamshire's 429/9 by 24 runs. Elgar also enjoyed great success in this competition, scoring 519 runs in the 6 games he played. Somerset were again involved in a thriller in the final round of games of the t20 Blast, where a 98-run victory against Hampshire saw them through to the quarter-finals by 0.07 on Net run rate for the first time since 2013. Somerset faced a difficult trip to Trent Bridge, and lost to Nottinghamshire by 5 wickets. At the end of the year it was announced that both one-day captain Jim Allenby and Director of Cricket Matthew Maynard would not be returning for 2018.", "|style=\"text-align:center\"|28|| Tom Abell* ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium || Club captain"]}, {"page": "England Lions cricket team", "response": ["| Tom Abell ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium || Somerset || 87"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Tom Abell (2014\u20132021) 91 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of University of Exeter people", "response": ["* Tom Abell - Somerset cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Tom Abell", "|align=left|Tom Abell", "|align=left|Tom Abell"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset Twenty20 cricket records", "response": ["| 1,181 || Tom Abell"]}, {"page": "Brisbane Heat", "response": ["| Tom Abell || style=\"text-align:center\" | || 5 March 1994 (age 27) || Right-handed || Right-arm medium || Visa contract"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club Twenty20 players", "response": ["Hildreth is Somerset's leading run-scorer in Twenty20 cricket, aggregating 3,900 runs.

Gayle's score of 151 not out, scored in 2015 against Kent is the highest score by a Somerset batsman, and Gayle also has the county's best batting average: 84.16. Among the bowlers, Alfonso Thomas and Max Waller have taken more wickets than any other, each claiming 137. The best bowling average is Dirk Nannes's 15.54. Arul Suppiah has the best bowling figures in an innings: he claimed six wickets against Glamorgan in a 2011 match, while only conceding five runs. Suppiah's figures in that match were the best by any bowler in Twenty20 cricket at the time.
