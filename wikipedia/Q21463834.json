His work focused on country landscapes and animals, particularly horses, and is notable for its detailed faithfulness to location and accuracy of representation. He worked chiefly in oils but also sketched in pencil and charcoal as well as painting in water colours. He was a quintessentially East Suffolk artist although he did occasionally tackle subjects from further afield. He was also a sensitive observer of natural history and was the author of many articles and one book on the subject.", "link_mentions": {}}}
