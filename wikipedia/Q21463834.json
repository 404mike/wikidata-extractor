His work focused on country landscapes and animals, particularly horses, and is notable for its detailed faithfulness to location and accuracy of representation. He worked chiefly in oils but also sketched in pencil and charcoal as well as painting in water colours. He was a quintessentially East Suffolk artist although he did occasionally tackle subjects from further afield. He was also a sensitive observer of natural history and was the author of many articles and one book on the subject.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Edward George Rope", "response": ["Henry Edward George Rope (Father Harry Rope)  (23 October 18801 March 1978) was a writer, poet, editor and priest widely known in the Roman Catholic Church in his long lifetime.  He was the eldest brother of Margaret Agnes Rope, stained-glass artist, nephew of Ellen Mary Rope, sculptor, and George Thomas Rope, painter and naturalist as well as cousin of M. E. Aldrich Rope, another stained-glass artist. Due to his writings and his work as archivist at the Venerable English College, Rome, he was well known in his lifetime, particularly within Church circles but as a radical traditionalist he has been forgotten in modern times.https://margaretrope.wordpress.com/2015/05/28/father-henry-rope-quite-a-character/ retrieved 19 Dec 2020"]}, {"page": "Ellen Mary Rope", "response": ["Born the seventh child of George and Anne Rope of Blaxhall, Suffolk, Ellen Mary Rope is said to have displayed strong artistic leanings as a child, maybe under the influence of her eldest brother, George Thomas Rope, a landscape painter and naturalist. To foster this interest, she was sent to London in 1870 to study at Nottingham Place School in Marylebone, where she was taught drawing by Octavia Hill. She later returned to her home village and attended Ipswich School of Art, taught by among others William T. Griffiths, the principal. Her first exhibited works were paintings and drawings of similar rural subjects to her brother, who exhibited alongside her. She returned to London to the Slade School of Fine Art in 1877, continuing to study drawing and painting but in 1880 Professor Alphonse Legros introduced a course in sculpture and modelling, which Rope followed to good effect, radically influencing the direction of her artistic career. Her art developed along classic Arts and Crafts lines, with emphasis on the artist's involvement throughout the creative process and manual not mechanised production. Rope was based in London for most of her professional career, latterly in Deodar Road, Putney, where she shared accommodation and a studio with her assistant Dorothy Anne Aldrich Rope, a niece. In the same road was the stained-glass studio of another niece M. E. Aldrich Rope, not to be confused with a third artistic niece Margaret Agnes Rope.
