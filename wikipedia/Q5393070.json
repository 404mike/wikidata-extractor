Two problems faced Mullineux, the first was that the timing of the tour meant that players would need to leave Britain in early May, when the university vacations had not yet begun. The second was that a long tour would preclude many of the best players from participating due to other commitments. Consequently, early lists of probable touring players had few players listed that finally made the tour. In the pool of potential players the following were noted: James Byrne, Cecil Boyd, Viv Huzzey, Zimans, Ernest Fookes,The Star misspells the name as Tookes. Lindsay Watson, M Elliott, Herbert Dudgeon, James Gowans, James Franks, J H Kipling, R Forest, Lawrence Bulger, Timoins,Otago Witness, 11 May 1899. Timoins is probably Alec B Timms who did tour. R O Swartz, C B Marston, W Neeks (or Needs), Dr Rowland, J W Gorman, and James Couper. Among these names were several high-profile players that recruitment attempts failed to secure. Byrne declined due to pressure of business, while Ernest Fookes was awaiting a serious medical operation. The final member to join the team was Scottish international Alf Bucher, after failed approaches were made to recruit fellow Scot James Couper and Welsh wing Viv Huzzey."]}, {"page": "Fookes", "response": ["*Ernest Fookes (1847\u20131948), New Zealand rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Rugby Union County Championship", "response": ["| ||  Ernest Fookes || Sowerby Bridge"]}]}}
