In time, especially after the opening of Lord's and the development of groundsmanship, pitches began to improve and batsmen were able to play longer innings than previously.  In the 1780s and 1790s, one of the best batsmen around was Tom Walker, who was also a very useful slow bowler.  Walker was another improviser like Lumpy and he began to experiment by bowling with his hand away from his body.  It is not clear how high he raised his hand but it could have been waist height.  He was accused of \"jerking\" the ball and so delivering it in an unfair and improper manner.  He was censured for his trouble and was forced to return to his normal underarm lobs, but he had sown the seeds of bowling's next revolution."]}, {"page": "Thomas Walker", "response": ["Thomas or Tom Walker may refer to:", "* Tom Walker (singer) (born 1991), Scottish singer-songwriter", "* Tom Walker (Homeland), a character in the TV series Homeland", "* Tom Walker, British actor and comedian known for his character Jonathan Pie, a fictional British news reporter", "*Tom Walker (comedian), Australian comedian, mime and Twitch Streamer.", "* Tom Walker (cricketer) (1762\u20131831), English cricketer", "* Tom Walker (1900s pitcher) (1881\u20131944), baseball player", "* Tom Walker (1970s pitcher) (born 1948), American baseball player", "* Tom Walker (footballer) (born 1995), English footballer", "* Tom Walker (priest) (born 1933), Anglican priest and author"]}, {"page": "Gentlemen v Players", "response": ["A curiosity of these matches is that they featured the veteran professional Tom Walker and the rookie amateur John Willes: these two players were both credited with devising the roundarm style of bowling, but there is no evidence to suggest they used roundarm in 1806."]}, {"page": "Hambledon Club", "response": ["From the mid-1760s, Hambledon's stature grew till by the late 1770s it was the foremost cricket club in England.According to In the Mists of Time  (3rd ed., 2005), the Artillery Ground, home of \"the original London Club\" from 1730 or earlier, \"became the featured venue of all London cricket until about 1765, after which the focus shifted to Hambledon and the London Club disbanded\".  In spite of its relative remoteness, it had developed into a private club of noblemen and country gentry, for whom one of cricket's attractions was the opportunity it offered for betting. Although some of these occasionally played in matches, professional players were mainly employed.In 1782 it was decided that those who played for the County XI should receive \"on the practice days, four shillings if winners and three shillings if losers, provided they attended by twelve of the clock\".

Legend has it that he and some of his fellow players in the \"Hambledon Era\" used to practise in a barn during the winters. Walker worked out that he could generate more bounce and variation of pace if he bowled with his arm away from his body and soon realised that these deliveries gave the batsman added problems.

The story goes that she found underarm bowling difficult in a hooped skirt, and so in around 1807, she began bowling in a roundarm style. Developing her technique through experimentation, she naturally bowled with a higher arm due to her skirts, and found roundarm to be far more successful for her than underarm.
