I would see no objection to including such a section where the college years are/were a meaningful part of the player's professional development (this might well only be Us/Canadian players, and the occasional other (eg Andrew Sambrook) who spent time there).  The problem is the college often refers to an institute of secondary level education (11-16 years of age) and I think that there would be agreement that we do not want every player's school team listed.
