He resembles a large dragon and is characterized by a deep, demonic voice. He stands at least a hundred feet high, and spends much of his time sitting on his throne dispensing punishment to wayward Urpneys. Zordrak was once a Dream Maker himself. He was ejected from the council for corrupting dreams into nightmares, when the council ejected him he transformed himself into his current form and landed in Viltheed where he remains vowing vengeance on the Dream Maker. His fearsome appearance is a sharp contrast with the simple cartoon-like style of his Urpney henchmen. While not physically disabled, he very rarely moves from his throne, and can transform into a mist/apparition in order to leave Viltheed. While playing a palpable role in Series One, concocting plans or even taking direct involvement, his role slightly diminishes in later series in favour of the Urpneys playing the main antagonists. His initial motive for stealing the stone is so he could freely send nightmares to the Sleeping World, but he later reveals his intention to use its powers to make himself Lord of the Universe. In Mike Jupp's original draft of the story, Zordrak was known as \"Nasta Shelfim\", which was an anagram for \"Satan himself\", the character was changed to Zordrak due to the original name being too dark."]}, {"page": "Oswald (TV series)", "response": ["*Head Gingerbread Man voiced by Gary Martin"]}, {"page": "Shock Treatment", "response": ["* Gary Martin as 'Bit' Guitarist"]}, {"page": "Killzone (video game)", "response": ["* Gary Martin as Additional Helghast Voices"]}, {"page": "List of Red Dwarf characters", "response": ["| Gary Martin"]}, {"page": "Budgie the Little Helicopter", "response": ["*Gary Martin as Smashit the Bulldozer"]}, {"page": "Space Precinct", "response": ["* Gary Martin as the voice of Officer Beezle (four episodes)", "* Gary Martin as the voice of Slomo - Station 88's Robot computer."]}, {"page": "Munkustrap", "response": ["The role of Munkustrap was originated by Jeff Shankley on the West End in 1981, and by Harry Groener on Broadway in 1982.
