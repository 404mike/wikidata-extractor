His mother died when he was seven, and he then began working with his father underground at a coal mine.  His father died seven years later, and Dixon then moved to Gomersal, where he continued working as a miner.In Gomersal, Dixon attended classes at the mechanics' institution, and in 1844 heard David Swallow speak about trade unionism.  He decided to emulate Swallow, and founded a local trade union.  He married in 1850, and soon moved to Drighlington, where he became secretary of the local miners' union.  This became part of the Adwalton and Drighlington Miners' Association, which undertook a major strike in 1862.  Dixon advised against strike action, but was defeated in a vote.  The strike was unsuccessful, leading to a wage reduction of 30% and the victimisation of the union leaders; although Dixon travelled the district in an attempt to find work, he could not find a colliery willing to employ him.  Only fifteen months later did he finally find work at Snydale.The Adwalton and Drighlington union had been largely destroyed by the 1862 strike, but Dixon was able to partially rebuild it, and in 1866 took it into a merger with the West Yorkshire Miners' Association (WYMA).  In exchange, he was employed as assistant secretary of the WYMA for three days a week, and in January 1867, he was elected as full-time secretary of the union.  He moved to Methley, then later to Normanton, to manage the union's affairs, and in Normanton was also elected as chairman of the school board in 1873.Dixon was also active in the Miners' National Union, and gave evidence to the 1873 Select Committee on Coal.  He died in 1876, still in office.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Dixon", "response": ["John Dixon may refer to:", "*John Dixon (English sportsman) (1861\u20131931), Nottinghamshire cricketer and international footballer", "*John Dixon (rugby league), Australian rugby league footballer and coach", "*John Dixon (Australian rules footballer) (1887\u20131947), Australian rules footballer ", "*John Dixon (1785\u20131857), Member of Parliament for Carlisle, England, 1847\u20131848", "*John Dixon (Welsh politician) (born 1951), Welsh politician and member of Plaid Cymru", "*John Dixon (Wisconsin politician) (1853\u20131938), American businessman and politician", "*John Dixon (trade unionist) (1828\u20131876), British trade unionist", "*John Dixon (bishop) (1888\u20131972), Canadian clergyman, Anglican Bishop of Montreal, 1943\u20131960", "*John Dixon (cartoonist) (1929\u20132015), Australian comic book artist", "*John Dixon (engineer) (c. 1795\u20131865), railway civil engineer", "*John Dixon (engraver) (1740?\u20131811), Irish mezzotint engraver", "*John Dixon (judge), Australian judge", "*John Dixon (filmmaker) (died 1999), Australian screenwriter and director", "*John Dixon (As the World Turns), fictional character on the American TV soap opera As the World Turns"]}, {"page": "West Yorkshire Miners' Association", "response": ["The union remained in existence, but undertook little activity.  In 1866, the small Adwalton and Drighlington Miners' Association merged into the WYMA, with its secretary, John Dixon, becoming assistant secretary of the WYMA, then secretary the following year, and membership reaching a peak of nearly 4,000.  A boom in the price of coal enabled it to build up some reserves, but a large number of miners in Morley left the union, and further lock-outs left other miners unable to sustain membership.  By 1870, the union had only 480 members, and was kept afloat only by a loan of \u00a3100 from the South Yorkshire Miners' Association (SYMA).  In 1871, the WYMA proposed amalgamation with the SYMA, but the SYMA rejected the idea.", ":1867: John Dixon"]}]}}
