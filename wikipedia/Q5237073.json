Over this period the advent of CCD imaging cameras on the AAT, with their greatly superior sensitivity, provided much more detailed information on distant galaxy clusters than was possible with the previous two-colour photographic approach. Couch exploited this opportunity to provide a clear picture of what the different spectral signatures told us about the underlying patterns of star formation activity.Couch, W.J., Sharples, R.M., 1987, MNRAS, 229, 423 In 1987, the brightest supernova in the modern era, SN1987a, exploded.
