They envisioned an ambitious multi-volume reference work that would examine the social production and consumption of maps across cultures from prehistoric origins to the 20th century. Harley died in 1991, but Woodward completed the work. These volumes are now the benchmark for students and academics in the field. James R. Akerman, Woodward's successor at the Newberry Library, has stated that Woodward's contributions to the field of cartography history are so substantial that they \"defy attempts to summarize them\".\"In Memorium: David Woodward,\" Mapline, Vol. 99 (2004) Malcolm Lewis stated that Woodward \"transformed the history of cartography from a directionless Eurocentric field into a respectable subject now global in scope.\" ", "* Harley, J.
