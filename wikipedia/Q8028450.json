Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic. Wherever it was tried\u2014in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers\u2014it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan, socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy.\"Rybcznski, Witold, Time magazine, 8 June 1998."]}, {"page": "Londonderry Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania", "response": ["The township was profiled in Witold Rybczynski's 2007 book Last Harvest: How a Cornfield Became New Daleville.

In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a then-unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis. It had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, which was one of the world's leading economic and financial powers in the 17th century, with the highest per capita income in the world from about 1600 to about 1720.In Karl Marx's own words, \"Its [17th-century Dutch Republic's] fisheries, marine, manufactures, surpassed those of any other country.

In a short time it became the most advanced shipbuilding nation in the world and developed large naval, fishing, and merchant fleets. (...)

From the 1940s the view of Hearst and Morgan's most important joint creation as the phantasmagorical Xanadu of Orson Welles's imagination has been commonplace. Although some literary depictions were gently mocking; P. G. Wodehouse's novel of 1953, The Return of Jeeves has a character describe her stay, \"I remember visiting San Simeon once, and there was a whole French Abbey lying on the grass\"; others were not. John Steinbeck's unnamed description was certainly of Hearst; \"They's a fella, newspaper fella near the coast, got a million acres. Fat, sof' fella with little mean eyes an' a mouth like a ass-hole\". The writer John Dos Passos went further, explicitly referencing Hearst in the third volume of his 1938 U.S.A trilogy. \"The emperor of newsprint retired to his fief of San Simeon where he built an Andalusian palace and there spends his last years amid the relaxing adulations of screenstars, admen, screenwriters, publicity-men, columnists, Until he dies, a spent Caesar grown old with spending.\" The English architectural writer Clive Aslet was little more complimentary about the castle. Disliking its \"unsympathetic texture (of) poured concrete\", he described it as \"best seen from a distance\". The unfinished, and unresolved, rear fa\u00e7ade of Casa Grande has been the subject of particular negative comment; Carleton Winslow and Nicola Frye, in their history from 1980, suggest the flanking North and South wings \"compete rather disastrously\" with the central doge's suite block. Others questioned the castle's very existence; the architect Witold Rybczynski asking, \"what is this Italian villa doing on the Californian Coastal Range? ... a costly piece of theatrical d\u00e9cor that ignores its context (and) lacks meaning\". Hearst's collections were similarly disparaged, the art historian William George Constable echoed Joseph Duveen when he assessed Hearst as \"not a collector but a gigantic and voracious magpie\"."]}, {"page": "2007 in architecture", "response": ["* Vincent Scully Prize \u2013 Witold Rybczynski"]}, {"page": "Global city", "response": ["In 2008, the American journal Foreign Policy, working with the consulting firm A.T.
