He is famous in particular for designing the Avro Lancaster bomber, its follow-up Avro Lincoln and preliminary designs of the Avro Vulcan V-bomber. He also converted the Lincoln into the Shackleton. His Avro Yorks carried one-third of the entire British tonnage during the Berlin Airlift.

No worthwhile information about high-speed flight was available from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) or the US.The Vulcan Story by the Technical Editor, Flight, 31 January 1958, p.143 Avro were aware that Alexander Lippisch had designed a delta-wing fighter and considered the same delta configuration would be suitable for their bomber.The Avro Type 698 Vulcan The Secrets Behind Its Design And Development, David W. Fildes 2012, , Bob Lindley recollections p.18 The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45\u00b0, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met.Gunston, W.T. \"The Vulcan Story.\" Flight, 31 January 1958, p. 143. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process.Laming 2002, pp. 23, 24.

Originally developed as an evolution of the Manchester (which had proved troublesome in service and was retired in 1942), the Lancaster was designed by Roy Chadwick and powered by four Rolls-Royce Merlins and in one version, Bristol Hercules engines. It first saw service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum, it was the main aircraft for the night-time bombing campaigns that followed. As increasing numbers of the type were produced, it became the principal heavy bomber used by the RAF, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and squadrons from other Commonwealth and European countries serving within the RAF, overshadowing the Halifax and Stirling.McKinstry 2009, pp.\u00a09\u201310.", "As early as mid-1940, Avro's chief design engineer, Roy Chadwick, had been working on an improved Manchester design.

Initially, the improved aircraft was designated as the Type 683 Manchester III; it was subsequently renamed as the Lancaster. The prototype aircraft, serial number BT308, was assembled by the Avro experimental flight department at Ringway Airport, Manchester; the prototype was constructed from a production Manchester airframe, which was combined with a new wing centre section designed to accommodate the additional engines.
