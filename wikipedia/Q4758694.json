Taylor was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm roundarm medium. He was born at Camberwell, Surrey.\nTaylor made a single first-class appearance for Surrey against the South in 1865 at The Oval. Surrey won the toss and elected to field first, with the South then making 196 all out, with Taylor taking the wicket of opening batsman Charles Payne to finish the innings with figures of 1/13 from ten overs. In their first-innings, Surrey were dismissed for 135, with Taylor being dismissed for a single run by George Bennett. The South responded in their second-innings by making 165 all out, setting Surrey a target of 227 for victory.
