The first two were Forest Trees of Britain (1847) and A Week at the Lizard (1848, focusing on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall); in both, some of the illustrations were engravings based on watercolours by Stackhouse, uncredited, but signed 'E.S.' This was followed by Johns's best-known book, Flowers of the Field, published in two volumes in 1851 with over 200 uncredited illustrations by Stackhouse. Referred to as \"the bible of the amateur botanist,\" its success was such that it went into more than 50 editions and was still in print a century after it first came out. In addition, after Johns and Stackhouse were dead, the SPCK continued to use Stackhouse's images in other books; it is estimated that they had been printed in at least 15 and as many as 30 different books by the end of the 19th century."]}, {"page": "Richard Cowley Powles", "response": ["He was the son of John Diston Powles, and was educated at Helston Grammar School under Derwent Coleridge.
