The group came to prominence playing rhythm and blues. They made some changes in musicians but settled on a line-up of Pinder, Thomas, Edge, guitarist Justin Hayward, and bassist John Lodge, who stayed together for most of the band's \"classic era\" into the early 1970s. Edge was the group\u2019s sole continuous member throughout their entire history.", "Their second album, Days of Future Passed, which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music which established the band as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \"landmark\" and \"one of the first successful concept albums\". The group toured extensively through the early 1970s, then took an extended hiatus from 1974 until 1977. Founder Mike Pinder left the group a year after they re-formed and was replaced by Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1978.  In the following decade they took on a more synth-pop sound and produced The Other Side of Life in 1986, which made them the first act to earn each of its first three top 10 singles in the United States in a different decade. Health troubles led to a diminished role for founder Ray Thomas throughout the 1980s, though his musical contributions rebounded after Moraz departed in 1991.  Thomas retired from the band in 2002.", "The Moody Blues formed in 1964 in Erdington, a suburb of Birmingham in the county of Warwickshire.  Ray Thomas, a young John Lodge and (occasionally) Mike Pinder had been members of El Riot & the Rebels. They disbanded when Lodge, the youngest member, went to technical college and Pinder joined the army. Pinder then rejoined Thomas to form the Krew Cats. Back from a disappointing spell in the Hamburg region a few months later,as told by Thomas in Pete Frame\u00b4s Rock Family Trees: Birmingham Beatsters the pair recruited guitarist/vocalist Denny Laine and band manager-turned-drummer Graeme Edge. Pinder and Thomas initially approached their former El Riot bandmate John Lodge about being the bass player, but Lodge declined as he was still in college.  They instead recruited bassist Clint Warwick. The five appeared as the Moody Blues for the first time in Birmingham in 1964. The name developed from a hoped-for sponsorship from the Mitchells & Butlers Brewery which failed to materialise, the band calling themselves both \"The M Bs\" and \"The M B Five\", and was also a subtle reference to the Duke Ellington song \"Mood Indigo\". In an interview it was revealed that the band was named \"Moody Blues\" because Mike Pinder was interested in how music changes people's moods and due to the fact that the band was playing blues at the time. Around this time the band were the resident group at the Carlton Ballroom, later to become rock music venue Mothers on Erdington High Street.", "In June 1966, Warwick retired from the group and the music business. He was briefly replaced by Rod Clark (born Rodney Clark, 23 November 1942, Surlingham, near Norwich, Norfolk), but in early October, Denny Laine also departed from the group,\"Denny left on Saturday and we\u00b4re not sure what we\u00b4re going to do. We\u00b4re waiting to see Brian Epstein to talk things over with him.\" Ray Thomas, as quoted by Record Mirror, 8 October 1966: . Epstein, however, dropped the band almost immediately (same website) which prompted Decca to release \"Boulevard de la Madeleine\" c/w \"This is My House (But Nobody Calls)\" (Decca F 12498, 1966) only a few days later, as the Moody Blues seemed to be disintegrating. Clark joined The Rockin' Berries.", "After financial misfortune and a confrontation with an audience member, the band realised that their style of American blues covers and novelty tunes was not working, and decided to perform primarily their own material. (However, as appearances on French TV show, they continued to do two covers through at least the first half of 1968: the Hayward-sung \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\", and \"Bye Bye Bird\", with the vocal and harmonica formerly done by Denny Laine now performed by Ray Thomas.) They were introduced to Decca staff producer Tony Clarke, who produced a recording session which saw Justin Hayward's \"Fly Me High\" and Mike Pinder's older-styled \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (Decca F12607) as the 'Mark Two' Moodies' first single released in May 1967. These picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. However, the sound gave clues about the direction in which their music would evolve. Their new style, featuring the symphonic sounds of Pinder's mellotron, was introduced on Pinder's song \"Love And Beauty\" (Decca F 12670) which was issued as a single c/w with Hayward's rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but further established their \"new\" Moodies identity. Ray Thomas's flute had been in evidence earlier (\"I've Got a Dream\") on their debut album; however, it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences, which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of everyman.", "The 1968 follow-up LP, In Search of the Lost Chord included \"Legend of a Mind\", a song written by Ray Thomas in tribute to LSD guru Timothy Leary which encompassed a flute solo performed by Thomas \u2013 four members of the group had taken LSD together at the start of 1967. A promotional film for the song was filmed on location at Groot-Bijgaarden Castle near Brussels in Belgium. Lodge provided a two-part song \"House of Four Doors\" set either side of Thomas' epic piece. Justin Hayward began playing sitar and incorporating it into Moody Blues music (\"Voices...\", \"Visions of Paradise\", \"Om\", etc.), having been inspired by George Harrison. Hayward's \"Voices in the Sky\" charted as a single in the UK (No. 27), as did Lodge's \"Ride My See-Saw\" (No. 42, No. 15 in France) \u2013 still their concert finale number \u2013 which featured Pinder's non-album song \"A Simple Game\" as the 'B' side. Pinder's \"The Best Way to Travel\" was another high point, as was his closing song \"Om\" (sung by Pinder and Thomas, again featuring Hayward on sitar). Graeme Edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry, and some of their early albums from the late 1960s began with various band members reciting poems by Edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that  followed. Edge narrated his brief \"Departure\" poem on \"Lost Chord\", although Pinder recited the majority of Edge's poetry, as according to Edge, he had the best voice for it due to smoking more cigarettes and drinking more whisky at the time.", "The band's music continued to become more complex and symphonic, with heavy amounts of reverberation on the vocal tracks, resulting in 1969's To Our Children's Children's Children\u00a0\u2013 a concept album inspired by the first moon landing. The opening track \"Higher and Higher\" saw Pinder simulate a rocket blast-off on keyboards, then narrate Edge's lyrics. Thomas' \"Floating\" and \"Eternity Road\" stood out, as did Hayward's \"Gypsy\" and a rare Pinder-Lodge collaboration \"Out and In\". Lodge provided his two-part \"Eyes of a Child\" and \"Candle of Life\" while Pinder contributed \"Sun is Still Shining\". The album closed with \"Watching and Waiting\", composed by Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward and sung by Hayward. It was during 1969 that the band established their own label \"Threshold\" under licence to Decca Records. To Our Children's Children's Children was the first of their albums to be released on their own label. The song \"Watching and Waiting\" was issued as a single on the Threshold label, but failed to chart.", "By this time, other bands were picking up their work. Pinder's songs \"A Simple Game\" (1968) and \"So Deep Within You\" (1969) were successfully covered by the Four Tops, Pinder winning an Ivor Novello Award for \"A Simple Game\", Elkie Brooks later covered Hayward's \"Nights in White Satin\". Pinder also appeared on John Lennon's \"Imagine\" album in 1971, providing additional percussion on \"I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier (I Don't Want to Die)\". The 1968 to 1972 album sleeves, plus several solo sets up to Ray Thomas's \"Hopes, Wishes & Dreams\" in 1976, were characterised by striking surreal scenic sleeve artwork (mostly gatefold sleeves) by artist Phil Travers.", "Clarke was also forced to leave because of non-musical reasons before the album was completed, but by the spring of 1978 Octave was ready for release. Pinder, citing his young family, excused himself from the touring commitments that were to follow. His decision caused acrimony within the band (notably from Edge). Ray Thomas said Pinder was initially agreeable to touring. His opting out (with a major comeback tour already planned) was a blow to the band. Their management tried to downplay Pinder's absence, notably at a major UK music press party Decca organised, when the top Decca dignitary guest, while making a \"welcome back\" speech, openly referred to \"Mike Pinder being currently absent over in the States\", much to the band's dismay.", "By this point, Ray Thomas was playing a diminished role in the recording studio with the band evolving into a synthpop act, a genre that was unsuitable for the use of a flute. Thomas provided additional percussion, notably tambourine, plus occasional harmonica, but by this point he was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer. Thomas provided some backing vocals for both The Other Side of Life and Sur La Mer. Multiple production considerations, however, led Visconti to leave Thomas's vocals off the latter of these two albums.", "Keys of the Kingdom, released in 1991, had modest commercial success when released and once again, Hayward's songs led off the album, with the new singles \"Say It with Love\" and \"Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back).\" Also included was a new ambient flute piece by Ray Thomas entitled \"Celtic Sonant.\" Hayward and Thomas also co-wrote \"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\" to close the album. Lodge made a defining shift in his songwriting on this album, leaving his trademark high-energy rock music, and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as \"Lean on Me (Tonight)\" (though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as \"Emily's Song\" for his daughter in 1971, \"Survival\" in 1978, and \"Talking Out of Turn\" in 1981), while his more powerful songs continued with \"Magic\" and the Lennonesque \"Shadows on the Wall\". This gentler trend continued on the two successive Moodies albums. Hayward wrote the driving two-part piece \"Say What You Mean.\" Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on \"Keys\", as did Christopher Neil and Alan Tarney. The ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the Montreux Jazz Festival. A non-album Hayward-Lodge song cut at these sessions, \"Highway\", was included on the \"Say It with Love\" twelve-inch single and on a later box set and compilation album, while the vinyl album did not include their song \"Once is Enough\" as on the compact disc version.", "From 1991 to 1998 the group took a hiatus from recording and spent time trying to perfect the art of performing live with an orchestra. The recording hiatus ended in 1999, with the album Strange Times, their first album in almost two decades to be more than moderately received by British critics, although Justin Hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the album's chart performance, which was notably less than Keys of the Kingdom in 1991. It was recorded in Recco, Italy, at Hayward's suggestion, and was the band's first self-produced effort. The album featured keyboards and arrangements from Italian musician Danilo Madonia, who continued to work in-studio with the band. The album opened with \"English Sunset\" a pop song featuring a modern, nearly techno arrangement. The song \"This Is the Moment\" (which is not on Strange Times), which was originally featured in the Broadway production of Jekyll and Hyde, was a minor hit in the US. Strange Times was also the first album since 1970 to include a new poem by Graeme Edge, \"Nothing Changes\", narrated by Edge, with Hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track, and notably concluded by quoting Mike Pinder's 1968 song title \"A Simple Game\". Also in 1999, the Moody Blues appeared in an episode of The Simpsons called Viva Ned Flanders. On Strange Times Ray Thomas appeared vocally with Hayward and Lodge on \"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\" and his own brief song \"My Little Lovely\", plus provided a vocal snippet and backing vocals on Hayward's \"English Sunset\"; this was his recorded vocal swan song with the band.", "The new millennium saw the Moody Blues reducing their touring schedule. At the end of 2002, founding member Ray Thomas retired from the group, reducing the Moody Blues to the trio of Hayward, Lodge and Edge, the last being the only original member. Flautist and rhythm guitarist Norda Mullen was recruited early the following year for their North American tour, and has worked with the band live and in the studio since then. Toward the end of 2003, they released an album entitled December. The songs included originals and four covers: John Lennon's \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\", Mike Batt's \"A Winter's Tale\", \"When A Child is Born\" and Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\". December was the group's first album to include covers since their 1965 debut album The Magnificent Moodies.", "Original vocalist and flautist Ray Thomas died on 4 January 2018, at the age of 76, just a few months before the band were due to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, at which the band gave what ultimately proved to be their final stage performance. Drummer and sole constant member Graeme Edge died on 11 November 2021, at the age of 80. Upon Edge's death, Justin Hayward announced that the Moody Blues had no longer been active since Edge had retired in 2018.", "In December 2017, the band were announced as inductees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On 14 April 2018, they were inducted as part of the 2018 class. During his acceptance speech in Cleveland, Ohio, Justin Hayward said, \"If you didn't know already, well we're just a bunch of British guys, but of course to us and to all British musicians, this is the home of our heroes and we all know that...\" acknowledging the inspirational role of America's rock and roll icons.
