A penalty from Nelson and a goal by Gill secured a third consecutive victory for the side. Cardiff suffered a 2\u20130 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on 18 March and, with their FA Cup semifinal to be played soon after, several first team regulars were rested for a match against Bury the week before and replaced by fringe players, including Jack Lewis who made his only appearance of the season. The weakened side ultimately fell to a heavy 4\u20131 defeat. A further defeat to Manchester City extended the run of defeats to three before a 1\u20131 draw with Arsenal ended the run. The Times remarked that reaching the final of the FA Cup appeared to have distracted the side, stating \"the edge was off the game early in the match\" and noted the lack of celebration for Beadles' equalising goal. Results did improve for the side soon after and, despite injury concerns and international call-ups, they recorded consecutive home victories over Aston Villa, Sunderland and Blackburn Rovers. After a goalless draw with league leaders Huddersfield Town, Cardiff ended its season by beating Liverpool 2\u20131, with goals from Beadles and Gill, and drawing 0\u20130 with relegated Preston North End. The side finished the campaign in 11th place.", "During the season, manager Fred Stewart used 24 players in all competitions. Goalkeeper Tom Farquharson and defender Jimmy Nelson made the most appearances of any players, both featuring in 46 matches during the campaign. Five other players made 40 or more appearances. Elvet Collins, Jack Lewis, Billy Taylor and George Whitcombe all made a single appearance during the season. Lewis and Whitcombe's appearances were their final matches for Cardiff before being released."]}, {"page": "History of the Wales national football team (1876\u20131976)", "response": ["Squad withdrawals continued to be a problem for the Welsh side. When Wales were left short for the visit of Scotland in the 1925\u201326 Championship, Ted Robbins called up debutant Jack Lewis after following him to a train station in Newport where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City. Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a late addition for the final match against England: John Pullen had been travelling to London with Moses Russell and was persuaded to join up to win his first cap, alongside Charlie Jones. Wales went on to win the match 3\u20131. Wales recorded a third championship win of the decade during the 1927\u201328 tournament, despite starting the competition poorly: they conceded two goals in the first half against Scotland before Ernie Curtis and an own goal by Jimmy Gibson salvaged a point. Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until Wilf Lewis secured the win for Wales by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net. When Ireland defeated Scotland two weeks later, Wales were officially confirmed as winners."]}]}}
