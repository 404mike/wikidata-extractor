He was a significant figure in the contexts of modern Jewish religious thought, Jewish-Christian relations, and Anglo-Jewish socio-politics, and educator. Montefiore was President of the Anglo-Jewish Association and an influential anti-Zionist leader, who co-founded the anti-Zionist League of British Jews in 1917.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Balfour Declaration", "response": ["The Conjoint Foreign Committee of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association had published a letter in The Times on 24 May 1917 entitled Views of Anglo-Jewry, signed by the two organisations' presidents, David Lindo Alexander and Claude Montefiore, stating their view that: \"the establishment of a Jewish nationality in Palestine, founded on this theory of homelessness, must have the effect throughout the world of stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands, and of undermining their hard-won position as citizens and nationals of these lands.\" This was followed in late August by Edwin Montagu, an influential anti-Zionist Jew and Secretary of State for India, and the only Jewish member of the British Cabinet, who wrote in a Cabinet memorandum that: \"The policy of His Majesty's Government is anti-Semitic in result and will prove a rallying ground for anti-Semites in every country of the world.\""]}, {"page": "Reform Judaism", "response": ["In its early days, this notion was greatly influenced by the philosophy of German idealism, from which its founders drew much inspiration: belief in humanity marching toward a full understanding of itself and the divine, manifested in moral progress towards perfection. This highly rationalistic view virtually identified human reason and intellect with divine action, leaving little room for direct influence by God. Geiger conceived revelation as occurring via the inherent \"genius\" of the People Israel, and his close ally Solomon Formstecher described it as the awakening of oneself into full consciousness of one's religious understanding. The American theologian Kaufmann Kohler also spoke of the \"special insight\" of Israel, almost fully independent from direct divine participation, and English thinker Claude Montefiore, founder of Liberal Judaism, reduced revelation to \"inspiration\", according intrinsic value only to the worth of its content, while \"it is not the place where they are found that makes them inspired\". Common to all these notions was the assertion that present generations have a higher and better understanding of divine will, and they can and should unwaveringly change and refashion religious precepts.Jakob Josef Petuchowski, \"The Concept of Revelation in Reform Judaism\", in Studies in Modern Theology and Prayer, Jewish Publication Society, 1998. pp. 101\u2013112.", "During its formative era, Reform was oriented toward lesser ceremonial obligations. In 1846, the Breslau rabbinical conference abolished the second day of festivals; during the same years, the Berlin Reform congregation held prayers without blowing the Ram's Horn, phylacteries, mantles or head covering, and held its Sabbath services on Sunday. In the late 19th and early 20th century, American \"Classical Reform\" often emulated Berlin on a mass scale, with many communities conducting prayers along the same style and having additional services on Sunday. An official rescheduling of Sabbath to Sunday was advocated by Kaufmann Kohler for some time, though he retracted it eventually. Religious divorce was declared redundant and the civil one recognized as sufficient by American Reform in 1869, and in Germany by 1912; the laws concerning dietary and personal purity, the priestly prerogatives, marital ordinances and so forth were dispensed with, and openly revoked by the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform, which declared all ceremonial acts binding only if they served to enhance religious experience. From 1890, converts were no longer obligated to be circumcised. Similar policy was pursued by Claude Montefiore's Jewish Religious Union, established at Britain in 1902. The Vereinigung f\u00fcr das Liberale Judentum in Germany, which was more moderate, declared virtually all personal observance voluntary in its 1912 guidelines.", "The term \"Reform\" was first applied institutionally \u2013 not generically, as in \"for reform\" \u2013 to the Berlin Reformgemeinde (Reform Congregation), established in 1845.Meyer, Response, p. 425. Apart from it, most German communities that were oriented in that direction preferred the more ambiguous \"Liberal\", which was not exclusively associated with Reform Judaism. It was more prevalent as an appellation for the religiously apathetic majority among German Jews, and also to all rabbis who were not clearly Orthodox (including the rival Positive-Historical School). The title \"Reform\" became much more common in the United States, where an independent denomination under this name was fully identified with the religious tendency. However, Isaac Meyer Wise suggested in 1871 that \"Progressive Judaism\" was a better epithet.Isaac Meyer Wise, Reformed Judaism, 1871. p. 261. When the movement was institutionalized in Germany between in 1898 and 1908, its leaders chose \"Liberal\" as self-designation, founding the Vereinigung f\u00fcr das Liberale Judentum. In 1902, Claude Montefiore termed the doctrine espoused by his new Jewish Religious Union as \"Liberal Judaism\", too, though it belonged to the more radical part of the spectrum in relation to the German one.", "In 1902, Claude Montefiore and several friends, including Lily Montagu and Israel Abrahams, founded the Jewish Religious Union (JRU) in London. It served as the cornerstone of Liberal Judaism in Britain. Montefiore was greatly influenced by the ideas of early German Reformers. He and his associates were mainly driven by the example and challenge of Unitarianism, which offered upper-class Jews a universal, enlightened belief. Meyer noted that while he had original strains, Montefiore was largely dependent on Geiger and his concepts of progressive revelation, instrumentality of ritual et cetera. His Liberal Judaism was radical and puristic, matching and sometimes exceeding the Berlin and American variants. They sharply abridged liturgy and largely discarded practice.Meyer, Response to Modernity, p. 214\u2013215; Michael A. Meyer, Judaism Within Modernity, pp. 309\u2013324. Langton has argued for the distinctly Anglo-Jewish character of the movement, which was dominated by Montefiore's idiosyncratic ideas.Langton, Daniel R.

Rayner, the most prominent of the movement's later theologians. Founder Claude Montefiore shared the ideals of worldwide Reform Judaism, also known as \"Progressive\" or \"Liberal\". So did Rayner, who affirmed a personal God; an ongoing (or \"progressive\") revelation allowing all to form their own views of religiosity, mandating a critical understanding of sacred texts and the evolving nature of Judaism across the ages; the separation between the ethical and ritual aspects of Judaism, with the latter serving as an instrumental capacity of the former and having no intrinsic value; personal autonomy for the individual; a belief in a messianic era of harmony instead of a personal messiah; and rejection of bodily resurrection of the dead in favour of, at most (though not necessarily), the immortality of the soul. The centrality of the Prophets' moral teachings was also stressed.John D. Rayner, A Jewish Understanding of the World, Berghahn Books, 1998. pp. 90\u201399, 150\u2013157 etc. As in the other branches of worldwide Reform, these convictions laid little emphasis on practical observance and regarded the mechanisms of Jewish Law as basically non-binding.", "The denomination began with Claude Montefiore. Intending to become a minister in the West London Synagogue, he attended the Berlin Hochschule f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums in 1881. There he was exposed to the work of the German founders of Reform Judaism, mainly Rabbis Abraham Geiger and Samuel Holdheim. While the religious philosophy he codified had its own original strains, his teachings were wholly reliant on theirs. He borrowed Geiger's notion of progressive revelation, accentuating it until there was very little difference between human reason and divine inspiration, and depicting it as a continuous process through history in which the People Israel grew aware of the great moral truths via God's communing with the Prophets and their own quotidian experience of the divine. Montefiore once remarked that he considered Holdheim his mentor, though he disagreed with many of his statements. He too differentiated sharply between an ethical core and ceremonial cask, regarding ritual as a means to end without much value unto itself, and regarded the Election of Israel in the terms of a universal mission to spread knowledge of God among the nations and prepare the way for a Messianic Era of harmony. His grasp of revelation also granted little importance to the divine origin of sacred texts, and Montefiore fully accepted higher criticism as to him, the human authors were influenced by God anyhow. In all this, noted Steven Bayme, he was little different from the German rabbis who initiated Reform or his contemporary Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, Chair of Hebrew Union College; Montefiore's unique contribution was his appreciation of mysticism, the first Reform thinker to do so. In contrast, Daniel Langton has argued for the distinctly Anglo-Jewish character of Montefiore's thought, and especially in terms of engagement with what Montefiore regarded as the best of Christian scholarshop and thought.Langton, Daniel R.
