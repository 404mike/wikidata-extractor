His work was inspired by his admiration for Barnsley, Gimson and Russell. He fitted many of the most important of Britain's coin collections including the Fitz-william, Cambridge, the Barber Institute, Birmingham, and the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow. More importantly yet, he supplied the Royal Mint with nearly 80 cabinets to house its complete collection.His work for Elizabeth II began in 1975 when a complete reorganisation of the Royal coin collection at Windsor Castle was begun. The cabinets were created from specially purchased Honduras mahogany and Indian rosewood. On one occasion a log was delivered to his workshop addressed \"Her Majesty the Queen of England, 3 Hexham Road, Heddon-on-the-Wall\". \nHe made the crosier and pectoral cross for Bishop Leonard", "link_mentions": {}}}
