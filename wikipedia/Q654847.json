Blackpool were also the popular choice among the public and press, many of whom had christened the fixture \"The Matthews Final\" hoping to see 36-year-old Stanley Matthews win the FA Cup for the first time.Hutchinson, 2004: 174 Milburn, annoyed by Blackpool's favoured status, later described his determination \"to spoil Matthews' Wembley party\".Hutchinson, 2004: 177 In the first half of the match, Milburn had a goal ruled out by referee William Ling for handball. Milburn later argued that \"he was wrong \u2013 I never touched it!\" \u2013 a claim vindicated by slow-motion replays.Joannou, 2004: 127 The goalless first half was a \"disappointing encounter for the neutral\" as Blackpool frustrated United and Milburn with a well-drilled offside trap. However, five minutes into the second half Robledo played a through-ball to Milburn who broke the offside trap, raced clear and sidefooted home to put United 1\u20130 up. Five minutes later, Milburn scored again. After a passing move on the right wing, the ball was played to Ernie Taylor who immediately back-heeled the ball to Milburn 25 yards from goal who in turn hit a first time, left-footed shot into the top corner of the Blackpool net with such force that he fell over in striking it.Potter, 2010: 79 Milburn's second goal was of such quality that Blackpool forward Stan Mortensen held up the restart for several seconds in order to congratulate the scorerYounger, 2006: 76 and told him \"that's just about the greatest goal I've ever seen. It deserves to win the cup\".Hutchinson, 2004: 179 United held on comfortably to win the match 2\u20130 and Matthews was in no doubt as to why United had won, telling the press afterwards:  It was definitely Milburn's match! His terrific speed made the first. The second was right out of the world! It was the greatest goal I have ever seen and certainly the finest scored at Wembley. A goal every player dreams about. Milburn's brace took his season's FA Cup total to 8 goals in 8 games.
