He was appointed as club captain by manager Ronnie Moore. He made his debut in the 2\u20130 win over Morecambe in the first game of the 2015\u201316 season, scoring the opening goal and providing an assist for Rakish Bingham. Three days later, Paynter scored in his second game to help Hartlepool beat Fleetwood Town 1\u20130 in the first round of the League Cup. His total of 15 goals in 35 appearances in the 2015\u201316 season made him the club's top-scorer and caused new manager Craig Hignett to exercise a contract clause to keep Paynter at the club for another year. He was out injured in January with an Achilles problem, and underwent surgery to correct the issue two months later. Hartlepool were relegated into non-league at the end of the 2016\u201317 season, and Paynter admitted that he did not know what manager Dave Jones had been doing with his tactics. Paynter was one of three men \u2013 along with Stuart Parnaby and Ian Gallagher \u2013 tasked with assisting caretaker-manager Matthew Bates for the final two games of the season, which ended in a defeat and a victory, but ultimately relegation.
