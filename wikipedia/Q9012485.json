North was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of a coal merchant and a churchwarden.  At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to millwrights and engineers before working for several years as a mechanic.  He moved to Chile where his first occupation was as a boiler riveter in Huasco.  He later moved to the Peruvian town of Iquique where he worked as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner.  The War of the Pacific (1879\u20131883) provided North with an opportunity to purchase large numbers of bonds in the Peruvian nitrate industry.  When Chile annexed Iquique and the surrounding province of Tarapac\u00e1 the Chilean government transferred ownership of the nitrate fields to the bondholders.  North was thus able to take a monopoly share of the lucrative Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment, becoming known as \"The Nitrate King\".\nNorth built upon his nitrates business by expanding into further monopolies in waterworks and freight railways, but also owned several iron and coal fields.  North maintained his monopolies by employing lawyers to block competing entrepreneurs both in court and the Chilean National Congress.  This was allowed by Chilean president Domingo Santa Mar\u00eda, but Santa Mar\u00eda's successor, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda, became concerned that Tarapac\u00e1 was starting to resemble a \"state within a state\" and resolved to break North's monopoly.  Balmaceda had to force competition reforms through against opposition in congress, amongst a series of disputes which would eventually escalate into the 1891 Chilean Civil War between the president and the congress.\nNorth also had investments in the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company which operated a concession in the Congo Free State.  This company was involved in the extraction and export of rubber from the state, another highly profitable business, but later became involved in abuses of human rights against those under its power.  However North's finances were eventually depleted and when he died his business empire had collapsed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Agricultural Revolution", "response": ["Besides the organic fertilisers in manure, new fertilisers were slowly discovered. Massive sodium nitrate (NaNO3) deposits found in the Atacama Desert, Chile, were brought under British financiers like John Thomas North and imports were started. Chile was happy to allow the exports of these sodium nitrates by allowing the British to use their capital to develop the mining and imposing a hefty export tax to enrich their treasury. Massive deposits of sea bird guano (11\u201316% N, 8\u201312% phosphate, and 2\u20133% potash), were found and started to be imported after about 1830. Significant imports of potash obtained from the ashes of trees burned in opening new agricultural lands were imported. By-products of the British meat industry like bones from the knackers' yards were ground up or crushed and sold as fertiliser. By about 1840 about 30,000 tons of bones were being processed (worth about \u00a3150,000). An unusual alternative to bones was found to be the millions of tons of fossils called coprolites found in South East England. When these were dissolved in sulphuric acid they yielded a high phosphate mixture (called \"super phosphate\") that plants could absorb readily and increased crop yields. Mining coprolite and processing it for fertiliser soon developed into a major industry\u2014the first commercial fertiliser.Coprolite Fertilizer Industry in Britain . Accessed 3 April 2012. Higher yield per acre crops were also planted as potatoes went from about 300,000 acres in 1800 to about 400,000 acres in 1850 with a further increase to about 500,000 in 1900.British food puzzle . Accessed 6 April 2012. Labour productivity slowly increased at about 0.6% per year. With more capital invested, more organic and inorganic fertilisers, and better crop yields increased the food grown at about 0.5%/year\u2014not enough to keep up with population growth."]}, {"page": "History of agriculture", "response": ["John Bennet Lawes began the scientific investigation of fertilization at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1843. He investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842. Fertilizer, in the shape of sodium nitrate deposits in Chile, was imported to Britain by John Thomas North as well as guano (birds droppings). The first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of phosphate from the dissolution of coprolites in sulphuric acid."]}, {"page": "Economic history of Chile", "response": ["When Chile found herself in command of the then still Peruvian province of Tarapac\u00e1 during the War of the Pacific and being subjected to pressure from Peru's creditors, who threatened Chile's credit in Europe if their claims were not met, the Chilean government essentially had two options: to nationalize the industry for Chile (that is to pay the Peruvian debt certificates), or to recognize the holders of the Peruvian debt certificates (which John Thomas North hurried to purchase at knock-down prices) as the owner of the assets. On June 11, 1881 Chile issued a decree in favor of the second option and to enact an export tax upon the export of saltpeter. The Chilean war debts, the impossibility to assume the financial obligations of nitrate certificates and the will to deflate European opposition to the annexation were the reasons to the decree that was criticized in Chile after the war."]}, {"page": "Stanis\u0142aw Julian Ostror\u00f3g", "response": ["File:John Thomas North, entrepreneur.jpg|John Thomas North, entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "John North", "response": ["*John Thomas North (1842\u20131896), British investor and businessman"]}, {"page": "Immigration to Chile", "response": ["The English immigration and influence was also important in the northern regions of the country during the saltpeter boom, in the ports of Iquique and Pisagua.

With this in mind he approached British Colonel John Thomas North, who had made a fortune through speculating on Chilean nitrates, for capital with which to fund a concession company. North agreed and provided \u00a340,000 of the 250,000 Belgian francs' (fr) initial investment.. As a result, the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (informally known as Abir) was established at Antwerp on 6 August 1892.. The company was divided into 2,000 shares of 500 fr value each. British investors (including North) held 1880 shares whilst Belgians held the remaining 120 shares. In addition to the 2,000 ordinary shares there were 2,000 \"actions\" which entitled the holder to a share of the profits after a 6% dividend was paid to the shareholders. The Congo Free State was the holder of 1,000 of these actions. In return Abir received exclusive rights to all forest products from the Maringa-Lopori basin for 30 years and all land within twenty miles of eight designated posts and had police powers within the limits of the concession. The Free State also had to supply guns, ammunition and soldiers to help establish the posts. In preparation two State employees were ordered to establish a headquarters for Abir at Basankusu but this was barely begun before the local villagers rebelled against State rule and killed both men."]}, {"page": "Robert Harvey (businessman)", "response": ["During the War of the Pacific, Harvey was captured at the Battle of San Francisco.
