In 1815 he went with the expedition that restored the Kingdom of Naples to the House of Bourbon after the defeat of Joachim Murat, then returned to Paris as a secretary with Lord Castlereagh's embassy that drafted the 1815 Treaty of Paris.\nHe was commissioned as Consul General at Buenos Aires on 10 October 1823 and then promoted to Charg\u00e9 d'affaires on 24 May 1825 on a salary of \u00a31500. He served in Buenos Aires until 1832.  In this capacity, he signed the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with Argentina on 2 February 1825, accompanying also official recognition by Great Britain of Argentine independence.\nWith Joseph Barclay Pentland, Parish surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes between 1826 and 1827.\nHe served as Chief Commissioner at Naples from 1840 to 1845.\nParish combined his diplomatic work with scientific research, particularly geology and palaeontology. In 1839 he published Buenos Ayres and the Provinces of the Rio de la Plata, an account of the geology of the Buenos Aires and R\u00edo de la Plata region and his findings of mammalian fossils, presenting Megatherium bones which were assembled and exhibited in the Natural History Museum, London. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, Geological Society and Royal Geographical Society, serving as vice-president of the latter. He corresponded with Charles Darwin.He lived at Quarry House, St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, having married firstly, in 1819, Amelia, the only child of Leonard Becher Morse, and had issue five sons and three daughters, and secondly, in 1844, Louisa Ann, daughter of John Hubbard, of Stratfield Grove, Essex, and sister of the 1st Baron Addington, having issue two sons and a daughter.

He wrote home describing this and the large skull as Megatherium fossils, or perhaps Megalonyx, and excitedly noted that the only specimens in Europe were locked away in the King's collection at Madrid. In the same layer he found a large surface of polygonal plates of bony armour. His immediate thought was that they came from an enormous armadillo like the small creatures common in the area. However, from Cuvier's misleading description of the Madrid specimen and a recent newspaper report about a fossil found by Woodbine Parish, Darwin thought that the bony armour identified the fossil as Megatherium.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With FitzRoy, Darwin went about  across the bay to Monte Hermoso on 19 October and found numerous fossils of smaller rodents in contrast to the huge Edentatal mammals of Punta Alta.
