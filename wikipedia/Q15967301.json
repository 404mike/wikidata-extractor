They built a hut on the rocky cape and wintered through nearly constant blizzards. Mawson wanted to do aerial exploration and brought the first aeroplane to Antarctica. The aircraft, a Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane,CDWS-1 Air tractor tail was to be flown by Francis Howard Bickerton. When it was damaged in Australia shortly before the expedition departed, plans were changed so it was to be used only as a tractor on skis. However, the engine did not operate well in the cold, and it was removed and returned to Vickers in England. The aircraft fuselage itself was abandoned. On 1 January 2009, fragments of it were rediscovered by the Mawson's Huts Foundation, which is restoring the original huts."]}, {"page": "Peter Finch", "response": ["He did radio acting work with Hugh Denison's BSA Players (for Broadcasting Service Association, later to become Macquarie Players).

The coast remained hidden behind impenetrable ice, and the land reported by Wilkes in 1840 appeared to be non-existent.

On 8\u00a0January\u00a01912, rounding a large glacier, they sailed into a gulf which Mawson later named Commonwealth Bay, and on further exploration they discovered a long sheltered inlet which they dubbed Boat Harbour.
