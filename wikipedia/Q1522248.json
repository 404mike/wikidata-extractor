He was Professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Cambridge between 1995 and 2011.\nBorn in 1944, Diggle was educated at St John\u2019s College, Cambridge; he completed Part II of the Classical Tripos in 1965, and went on to complete his doctoral studies there; his PhD was awarded in 1969. He was appointed a research fellow at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1966 and was elected to an official fellowship the following year. He was the college librarian from 1969 to 1977 and praelector from 1971 to 1973 and again from 1978 to 2015. He was also an assistant lecturer in classics at the University (1970\u201375) and then lecturer until 1989, when he was appointed to a readership. He was then Professor of Greek and Latin from 1995 until he retired in 2011. Diggle also served as Public Orator between 1982 and 1993.In 1985, Diggle was elected a Fellow of the British Academy, the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities.

According to an ancient summary, Clymene (who had claimed that her lawful husband Merops was the father of her son Phaethon, the product of an illicit affair) revealed to Phaethon that he was the child of Helios, rather than her husband. It's been suggested that Clymene made this revelation to Phaethon in order to overcome his reluctance to get married; the greatest problem of the fragmentary plot is the identity of Phaethon's wife. H. Weil suggested it is one of Phaethon's half-sisters, the Heliades, and James Diggle noted that while this suggestion is unprovable, he is convinced that it is correct. Clymene convinces him to go seek out his father. Thus Phaethon travels to the east, so that Helios can confirm his true parentage.Hugh Lloyd-Jones, The Classical Review Vol. 21, No. 3 (Dec., 1971), pp. 341\u2013345  In surviving fragments, Phaethon drives the solar chariot as his father, accompanying him in his celestial journey riding on (perhaps) horse (named Sirius), tries to guide him.Euripides, Phaethon fr. 779 (p. 348). After Phaethon's disastrous ride, near the end Clymene mourns her son, and orders slave girls to bring Phaethon's still smoking dead body in the palace and hide it from Merops, while lamenting Helios' role in his demise.Phaethon fr 781 N\u00b2; surviving fragments of the tragedy can be found in Greek here Merops discovers his son's charred corpse, and the truth, a bit later. In reconstructing the lost play and discussing the fragments, James Diggle has discussed the treatment of the Phaethon myth (Diggle 2004)."]}, {"page": "A Greek\u2013English Lexicon", "response": ["LSJ was the basis of the project of John Chadwick and James Diggle at Cambridge to publish the Cambridge Greek Lexicon of 2021.
