Johnson (died 3 March 1883) was a British surveyor in the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. He is noted for the first definition of the eastern boundary of Ladakh along Aksai Chin in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has come to be called the 'Johnson Line'. After retiring from the Survey of India, Johnson was appointed as the Governor of Ladakh, in which position he served until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aksai Chin", "response": ["William Johnson, a civil servant with the Survey of India proposed the \"Johnson Line\" in 1865, which put Aksai Chin in Kashmir.Mohan Guruswamy, Mohan, \"The Great India-China Game\" , Rediff, 23 June 2003. This was the time of the Dungan revolt, when China did not control most of Xinjiang, so this line was never presented to the Chinese. Johnson presented this line to the Maharaja of Kashmir, who then claimed the 18,000 square kilometres contained within, and by some accounts territory further north as far as the Sanju Pass in the Kun Lun Mountains. The Maharajah of Kashmir constructed a fort at Shahidulla (modern-day Xaidulla), and had troops stationed there for some years to protect caravans. Eventually, most sources placed Shahidulla and the upper Karakash River firmly within the territory of Xinjiang (see accompanying map).  According to Francis Younghusband, who explored the region in the late 1880s, there was only an abandoned fort and not one inhabited house at Shahidulla when he was there \u2013 it was just a convenient staging post and a convenient headquarters for the nomadic Kirghiz.Younghusband, Francis E. (1896). The Heart of a Continent. John Murray, London. Facsimile reprint: (2005) Elbiron Classics, pp. 223\u2013224. The abandoned fort had apparently been built a few years earlier by the Kashmiris.Grenard, Fernand (1904). Tibet: The Country and its Inhabitants. Fernand Grenard. Translated by A.

In 1878 the Chinese had reconquered Xinjiang, and by 1890 they already had Shahidulla before the issue was decided. By 1892, China had erected boundary markers at Karakoram Pass."]}, {"page": "William Johnson", "response": ["William Johnson may refer to:", "* William Johnson (artist) (1901\u20131970), African\u2013American painter of the Harlem Renaissance", "* William Johnson (actor) (1916\u20131957), American actor", "* William Johnson (judge) (1771\u20131834), Justice of the United States Supreme Court", "* Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet (1715\u20131774), Anglo\u2013Irish major general and British Indian agent, based in Johnstown, New York and highly influential with the Iroquois League", "* William Johnson (Medal of Honor) (1855\u20131903), American recipient of the Medal of Honor", "* William Johnson (Royal Navy officer) (1784\u20131851), Scottish Naval Captain", "* William Johnson (educator) (1895\u20131981), American educator who served as Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools", "* William Johnson (Seneca County, NY) (1821\u20131875), New York State Senator and Civil War colonel", "* William Johnson (by 1523 \u2013 1553 or later), MP for Kingston\u2013upon\u2013Hull", "* William Johnson (Liberal-Labour politician) (1849\u20131919), English coal miner, trade unionist and Liberal\u2013Labour politician", "* William Johnson (trade unionist) (1866\u2013?), English trade union leader and socialist activist", "* William Johnson (MP for Bedford) (by 1513\u20131558), MP for Bedford and New Woodstock", "* William Johnson (Australian politician) (1871\u20131916), Australian politician", "* William Johnson (bishop) (1889\u20131960), Anglican Bishop of Ballarat, Australia", "* William Johnson (surveyor) (died 1883), British surveyor in India and governor of Ladakh", "* William Johnson (baseball) (1848\u20132013), American baseball player", "* William Johnson (cricketer, born 1884) (1884\u20131941), Australian cricketer", "* William Johnson (cricketer, born 1962), English cricketer", "* William Johnson (handballer) (born 1953), American Olympic handball player", "* William Johnson (rugby league) (1916\u20131997), rugby league footballer of the 1930s for Wales, and Huddersfield", "* William Johnson (swimmer) (1947\u20132005), American freestyle swimmer at the 1968 Summer Olympics", "* William Johnson (wrestler) (1901\u20131928), American wrestler", "* C.
