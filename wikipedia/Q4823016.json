Worcestershire, short of players, sent out a call to Gilbert Ashton, headmaster of Abberley Hall School  and a man who was to play a number of times for the county in the years ahead. However, Ashton was unwell and so sent Carr, a junior member of the school staff. Carr tried to protest that he was not good enough, but in the event he succeeded magnificently, scoring 82 from number eight in the order. He also bowled two overs without reward: his only bowling spell in first-class cricket. In the second innings he was promoted to bat at three, but was dismissed for 17.\nAfter such a performance, Carr was chosen for two more matches that season, one of them against a Nottinghamshire team captained by his namesake Arthur Carr and the other against Lancashire. He could manage only 4, 28 and 2 in his three innings, however, and was no more successful (making 7, 4 and 2) in the couple of games he played in 1922. He was to play only one more first-class match, three years later against Somerset, but again he failed to make a significant score, making 0 and 4 in an innings defeat.\nCarr was born at Lower Hall, Broxton, Cheshire; he died at the age of 48 in Great Witley, Worcestershire.His brother Edward played for Cheshire at minor counties level in 1912.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Broxton, Cheshire", "response": ["*Austin Carr, cricketer, was born at Lower Hall, in Broxton in 1898."]}, {"page": "Austin Carr (disambiguation)", "response": ["Austin Carr (born 1948) is an American basketball player.", "Austin Carr may also refer to:", "*Austin Carr (American football) (born 1993), American football player", "*Austin Carr (cricketer) (1898\u20131946), English cricketer"]}]}}
