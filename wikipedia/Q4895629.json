He is currently co-driven by James O'Brien from Co. Cork. He is best known for driving the Subaru Impreza but first made his name driving a Toyota Celica on the 1996 Donegal International Rally. He defied the odds to beat top drivers such as Bertie Fisher and Austin MacHale. Since then he has had a host of rally wins. In 2000 he broke all records by winning the Donegal International and winning all 22 stages. He went on to become Tarmac Champion in 2000 and 2002. Andrew has taken a number of wins since 2002, but has failed to reclaim the tarmac title. He was often leading rallies or was in a strong position, until mechanical failures let him down. More recently he has performed very well, but has been unable to compete in a full season. Andrew's car is currently sponsored by Rutledge Joblink and Cross-Refrigeration. His car is prepared by McKinstry Motorsport. In 2004 Andrew realised his dream by entering the WRC (World Rally Championship) for the first time. He entered the snow event in Sweden and finished a very respectable 28th, in what is a very specialist event. He was 5th amongst the privateer crews. One of the most remarkable achievements of Andrew's career was winning the Jim Clark Memorial Rally for three consecutive years, breaking the record in the process."]}, {"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Bertie Fisher (1878\u20131972), British general"]}, {"page": "1984 World Rally Championship", "response": ["|  Bertie Fisher", "|align=left|  Bertie Fisher"]}, {"page": "Southern Command (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*September 1939 - June 1940 Lieutenant General Sir Bertie Fisher"]}, {"page": "Irish Tarmac Rally Championship", "response": ["|  Bertie Fisher", "|  Bertie Fisher", "|  Bertie Fisher", "|  Bertie Fisher"]}, {"page": "List of governors and commandants of Sandhurst", "response": ["*1934\u20131937: Major-General Bertie Fisher'FISHER, Lieut-General Sir Bertie Drew', in Who Was Who 1971\u20131980 (A. & C.

An ambitious route under the watchful eye of the relatively youthful Michael \"Bones\" O'Connor saw the 21 stage rally start in Clonakilty and end up in Bantry for the lunch halt. The same stages were tackled in reverse all the way back towards Clonakily that day with a total of thirteen tough test in mainly appalling weather. The second day had eight more stages, and the weather didn't let up, but Mick & Anne O'Connell were the victors in somewhat controversial circumstances. They were off the road for over 20 minutes on a stage that was ultimately cancelled. Ger Buckley his closest rival wasn't happy and appealed the decision to the RIAC, but the O'Connells were eventually awarded the win. The event lost its championship status for 1979, but that didn't hinder its progress as by 1980 upwards of 160 crews were starting the event, many of them travelling from all parts of the U.K., including Billy Coleman, Roger Clark, Malcolm Wilson (now head of Ford Motorsport), Jimmy McRae (father of Colin McRae), Ger Buckley and Bertie Fisher. The demanding West Cork stages proved too much for many of the big names who were forced out with Ger Buckley claiming the title that year.
