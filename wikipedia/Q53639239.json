He was to stay in Amberley until his death in 1918 recording the lives of its inhabitants at work and at play. He immersed himself in the landscape of chalk downs, undulating meadows and the wild brooks of the River Arun that flooded in the winter. It was a vision of a perfect English village unencumbered by the advance of industrialisation and urbanisation. Some Victorians had convinced themselves of the moral turpitude of the urbanised working class. Their response was to look back to an Avalon of the mind. Stott's paintings provided balm and succour that the countryside remained an unchanging idyll.Malcolm Warner (1996), The Victorians: British Painting 1837\u20131901, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. The truth was that Amberley, was a living village populated by real people some with difficult lives to lead. A railway station was opened in 1863 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway with a line that passed a few hundred metres from the ancient Amberley Castle walls. The railway bought day trippers to fish the famous trout waters of the Arun whilst boaters navigated the river to nearby Houghton Bridge. There were duck shooters on the Amberley Brooks in the winter months. The railway provided ready access to London and to coastal conurbations of Portsmouth and Brighton bringing day trippers that included artists drawn to the lovely landscape and ever changing light. The shy and often diffident Stott was a reluctant celebrity to this changing group of aspiring artists that included: the early aviator and landscape artist Jose Weiss (1859\u20131919) and Arthur Winter Shaw (1869\u20131948), the latter demonstrably inspired by Stott, Gerald Burn (1862\u20131945), an etcher and engraver, and watercolorist Felicia Lievan Bauwens. The garrulous and extrovert Fred Stratton, father of the sculptor Hilary Stratton, lived at Amberley from where he entertained well-disposed friends such as Eric Gill and the composer John Ireland , who composed Amberley Wild Brooks in 1921, following a visit to Stratton. The American writer Gladys Huntington was also a resident. Edyth Starkie, portrait painter and sculptor and her husband Arthur Rackham the illustrator lived in Amberley for ten years in the 1920s.http://www.amberleysociety.org.uk/artists.html Amberley Society (2013)Victorian Painters: Dictionary of British Art, (1995)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* Hilary Stratton (1906-1985), sculptor"]}]}}
