Her work critiques civilization, technologies, and, what she calls a \"predatory anthropology\". In Children's Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness (2015), she attributes the Holocene extinction and climate change to the human choice of hunting as a cultural choice for subsistence. This anthropological revolution in human self-construction as predator, she argues, generated the need for developing the technologies that would ensure the propagation of a predatory culture and violence. \"The first of these technologies is ... the technology of absence. ... This entails physical and emotional absence, but also includes a metaphysical dimension, since technological development is literally linked to death. Namely, the rise of hunting, i.e. killing of others for food, during the Upper Palaeolithic period in the Middle East led some human groups to develop hunting technologies\". She cites palaeoanthropologist Clive Gamble who connects this development in hunting technologies to colonization and the work of anthropologist Richard Lee (1988) who links the appearance of human language to the rise in hunting activities during that period. AbdelRahim concludes that hunting \"thus led to domestication, and both of these cultures of subsistence kill intentionally and on a systematic basis\". Civilization with its cultural, political, and social institutions that classify living beings for the purpose of exploitation, she says, is the material manifestation of this cultural choice and anthropology."]}, {"page": "List of trustees of the British Museum", "response": ["*Clive Gamble (appointed 2010) "]}, {"page": "List of cryptozoologists", "response": ["* Clive Gamble (b. 1951), British anthropologist; wild men skeptic and co-author of In Search of the Neanderthals"]}, {"page": "Rudolf Virchow lecture", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Prof.  Clive Gamble"]}, {"page": "Sara Champion", "response": ["The Prehistoric Society's annual Sara Champion Memorial Lectures are held every October at the Society of Antiquaries lecture theatre in Burlington House, Piccadilly, London.
