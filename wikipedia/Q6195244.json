Glennie is the band's longest-serving member, having been there from the first line-up through to the present day.Glennie never really had an interest in music in his youth, but his childhood best friend Paul Gilbertson managed to change his mind after convincing him to buy a bass guitar. Two weeks later they played their first concert at Eccles Royal British Legion club, in which their singer did not show up. Glennie offered himself up to sing instead, and the club manager pulled the plug halfway through their second song, demanding they stopped playing.\nGlennie and Gilbertson's ritual, in the very early years, was to get very drunk before they went onstage to calm their nerves \u2013 this partly explains why they were almost unlistenable when the band first started \u2013 coupled with their own admittance that they could not really play their instruments at the time either.\nAfter Gilbertson's sacking Glennie was quite badly affected initially, having lost a very close friend and musical companion. Glennie stuck it out, however, and remained true to the James cause. He and the band's singer Tim Booth often had many conflicts, due to Glennie feeling Booth was not doing what was best for the band. Saul Davies admitted in the 2006 Q article that Glennie and Booth \"didn't always see eye to eye\".\nHe is also the only remaining original member of James.\nGlennie's style of playing is very much punk influenced as he mostly uses a plectrum to play the bass; but often plays in a more melodic way as a part of the rhythm section.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Madchester", "response": ["James were formed in 1982 by Paul Gilbertson and Jim Glennie (after whom the band was named), recruiting drama student Tim Booth on vocals and Gavan Whelan on drums (Gilbertson and Whelan were to leave the band before it attained commercial success).

Sales of their two albums for Blanco y Negro Records, Stutter in 1986 and Strip-mine in 1988, were disappointing; at the time Madchester began, the band was using T-shirt sales to fund its own releases through Rough Trade Records.

Their line-up solidified when Gavan Whelan joined on drums. They played a string of gigs under the names Venereal and the Diseases and Volume Distortion before settling on the name of Model Team International, then shortened to Model Team. They performed mostly improvised material derived from jam sessions, supporting The Fall at an early gig at Manchester Polytechnic. Vocalists and other musicians drifted rapidly in and out of their line-up until the band encountered Tim Booth at a student disco. Gilbertson invited him to the band's scout hut in Withington to join the band as a dancer; he was soon promoted to lead singer. After a brief period under the name Tribal Outlook, the band renamed themselves James in August 1982. A gig at the Ha\u00e7ienda caught the attention of Tony Wilson of Factory Records. He offered James an album deal with Factory, but the band, by now a settled live act, were worried about tarnishing their material in the studio and settled instead for a three-track EP. Their debut release, the Jimone EP, was recorded at Strawberry Studios, Stockport, in August 1983 and released on Factory Records in September. It led to the band providing support for The Smiths between February and April 1985 on the Meat is Murder tour.
