Aitken-Walker entered competition in 1979 and finished 19th in her first Rally GB two years later. She contested the 1989 British Touring Car Championship in a Class C Vauxhall Astra finishing fifth in points, and in 1990 was the first ever Ladies World Champion, the pinnacle of a successful 14-year career. She was awarded the Segrave Trophy in 1990. She retired in 1993 to have a family (son John and daughter Gina) and concentrate on her business affairs. She runs Aitken-Walker Cars, which specializes in quality used cars, with her husband Graham in the Scottish Borders.In September 2008, Aitken-Walker took part in the Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally, a round of the Scottish Rally Championship centred in Perth in Scotland. A historic Talbot Sunbeam Lotus was her chosen car for the event.

However, the Vauxhall Astra and Vauxhall Nova were campaigned in the lower power classes during the mid-1980s, and became popular amateurs' cars thanks to their reliability, ease of tuning and ready supply of parts.  After the banning of Group B in 1986 the Group A Astra returned to the forefront.  As a two-litre, front-wheel-drive car it was unable to challenge the four-wheel-drive cars for outright victory, but did score top ten placings on several World Championship events.  Louise Aitken-Walker won the ladies' World Championship in 1990 in an Astra, despite a serious accident on that year's Rally of Portugal when her car rolled down a hillside and into a lake."]}, {"page": "World Rally Championship", "response": ["The World Rally Championship Ladies Cup ran from 1990 to 1995 and could be won by any class of car.
