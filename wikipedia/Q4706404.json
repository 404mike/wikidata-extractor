Originally broadcast in the old Tube time slot of 6\u00a0pm Friday evenings, The Word's main live show was shifted to a late-night timeslot from 9 November 1990. The magazine format allowed for interviews, live music, features and even game shows. The flexible late-night format meant that guests could do just about anything to be controversial."]}, {"page": "Shaun Pye", "response": ["He first met his comedy partner Harry Thompson while working on The 11 O'Clock Show, and together they created the dark satirical animation Monkey Dust, which broadcast on BBC Three for three series. The pair collaborated with Alan Connor in 2006 to create Respectable, a sitcom for channel Five about a suburban brothel. Following Thompson's death from lung cancer, Shaun took over production of the show. He also co-produced the short-lived quiz show It's Only TV... But I Like It."]}, {"page": "Bad Day (Daniel Powter song)", "response": ["The lyrics of \"Bad Day\" were said to have a universal appeal by Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine as they have an \"everyman breeziness\" because the song's subject can be any person going through a bad daytime. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as: \"a loping, sunny tune that pretty much has the opposite sentiment of its title\". Although About.com's Bill Lamb described its lyrics as having a \"reassuring, comforting\" tone, Powter said the song \"mak[es] fun of self-absorbed and narcissistic people who bitch and gripe\". He also affirmed: \"It's not literally about having a bad day, it's more about not taking yourself too seriously and complaining about trivial things\".", "The song received mixed reviews by commentators; some reviewers praised it for its composition, while other critics felt that the lyrics were not profound. Billboard Chuck Taylor called the song \"instantly memorable\" and praised its instrumentation for being different \"from the scores of adolescent thrust-rockers currently dominating the scene.\" Dubbing it \"elegant, timeless pop/rock\", Taylor qualified it as \"one of the great discoveries of the year\", while Pete Waterman, writing for The Guardian in 2007, stated it was \"one of [his] favourite songs of recent years\". Eric R. Danton from the Hartford Courant  classified it as the best track on the album, while Erlewine called it \"the template for the rest of his debut\". In contrast, Wilson Kung said the song \"pales in comparison to some of the truly strong songs\" on the album Daniel Powter. Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine said it is a typical sentimental song but that in \"Bad Day\"'s case \"there's even less detail\". He said the song \"is so low on the specifics, there are some couplets that feel like they've been translated from a foreign language, possibly by a computer\". A writer for The Daily Edge called it \"a song so sweet it gave you a toothache\", while a reviewer from The Scotsman called it a \"horrible song\". Bill Lamb said it \"feels genuine\" but \"if you are looking for depth, this is not your song\", Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times said the song is \"baleful but soulful\", and People commented: \"'Bad Day' may be catchy enough to overcome its trite lyrics\".", "\"Bad Day\" was much-used in the media to the point where Powter declared he felt \"quite detached from th[e] song. It's more like it's everybody's song.\" According to Alan Connor: \"...turning off the radio isn't enough to escape the tune. It can be heard everywhere from in shops, on mobiles and especially on TV.\" During Christmas 2004, the song was used in a Coca-Cola advertisement which played in France for two weeks. It was also featured in a television advertisement for Right Guard deodorant in the United Kingdom."]}, {"page": "Respectable (TV series)", "response": ["The show was written by Shaun Pye, Alan Connor and Harry Thompson.

The idea to focus an episode on crosswords came from Pemberton; he had long been a fan of cryptic crosswords, but particular inspiration came from Two Girls, One on Each Knee: The Puzzling, Playful World of the Crossword, a non-fiction book by Alan Connor. The crossword featured in \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was set by Pemberton, and was published in The Guardian on the day the episode aired, credited to \"Sphinx\".

Pemberton had first met Connor through an appearance on the BBC game show Only Connect, on which the latter was working as a question setter. Subsequently, he received a copy of Connor's book. Reading Two Girls, One on Each Knee led Pemberton to ask whether one could \"dramatize doing a crossword, which is so un-dramatic?\" Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith relish the challenge set by writing limitations, such as basing an episode around a crossword. Such constraints, he felt, encourage them to produce their best work."]}, {"page": "Richard Osman's House of Games", "response": ["On 17 October 2019, Osman and Alan Connor published Richard Osman's House of Games: 101 new & classic games from the hit BBC series, a quizbook based on the programme."]}]}}
