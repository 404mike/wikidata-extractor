Richardson also plays internationally for Great Britain. He is the younger brother of Lee Richardson who also played ice hockey at a professional level.\nRichardson began his career with his hometown team the Swindon Lynx. In 2003, Richardson moved to the Bracknell Bees in a two-year spell.  Richardson's good performances during the 2004\u201305 season, which included nine goals and 18 assists for 27 points, saw him move to the Elite League for the Cardiff Devils.  His first season of 10 points in 30 games was impressive for an Elite League rookie, but his second season saw him collect 33 points, including 24 assists in 54 games.\nRichardson moved to the Nottingham Panthers in 2007, in what was a slightly disappointing season for him, but still managed to collect 20 points in 46 games.  In 2008, Richardson signed with the Basingstoke Bison. Shortly after the end of the 2008\u201309 season, with Basingstoke dropping out of the Elite League, Richardson re-signed for the Cardiff Devils as a defenceman.\nHe moved briefly to Kazakhstan to sign for Arlan Kokshetau before re-joining Cardiff in 2012. He remained with Cardiff until 2020 but left the Elite League side over ongoing uncertainty about whether the 2020-21 Elite League season would go ahead.\nOn 8 September 2020, Richardson moved abroad for a second time, signing a one-year deal with German DEL2 team EC Bad Nauheim. The expectation is Richardson will return to Cardiff in 2021.In July 2021, the Cardiff Devils announced Richardson had signed terms for the 2021\u201322 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Richardson", "response": ["Mark Richardson may refer to:", "* Mark Richardson (sprinter) (born 1972), British Olympic sprinter", "* Mark Richardson (cricketer) (born 1971), New Zealand ex-cricketer, turned sports commentator and journalist", "* Mark Richardson (footballer) (born 1972), Australian rules footballer", "* Mark Richardson (ice hockey) (born 1986), English ice hockey player", "* Mark Richardson (musician) (born 1970), drummer for the band Skunk Anansie and formerly Feeder", "* Mark Richardson (politician) (born 1952), minority leader in the Missouri House of Representatives", "* Mark Richardson (American football), American businessman and co-owner of the Carolina Panthers"]}, {"page": "Great Britain men's national ice hockey team", "response": ["| 17 || D || align=left|Mark Richardson \u2013 A ||  ||  ||  || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Rote Teufel Bad Nauheim"]}, {"page": "2009 IIHF World Championship Division I rosters", "response": ["|Mark Richardson"]}, {"page": "Cardiff Devils", "response": ["On 16 February 2010, leader Brad Voth was relieved of the captaincy, after over 3 years, by head coach Gerad Adams.

Also, if Voth had been ejected from one more game as captain, he would face a lengthy ban. Therefore, by relinquishing the armband he could carry on playing the enforcer role.
