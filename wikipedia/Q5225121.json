He's been a consistent force in an otherwise shaky foxes batting line up. In his first two seasons at the club he scored over 1000 runs in the county championship and in his third season which was interrupted by injury he still scored over 700 runs.\nRobinson captained Leicestershire towards the latter part of the 2006 season after Jeremy Snape dropped himself because of a lack of form. Robinson impressed in the field and helped guide Leicestershire to a 4th-place finish. Midway through the 2007 season Robinson himself lost his place due to a lack of form, and the captaincy of the side to Paul Nixon. It is thought unlikely that his contract will be renewed.\nRobinson's highest score is 200 against the touring New Zealand side in 1999 while still with Essex.\nHe now plays for Wickford Cricket Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Halstead", "response": ["The town is home to Halstead Cricket Club, which fields three teams in the Marshall Hatchick Two Counties Championship.
