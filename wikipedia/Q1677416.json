A captain of the Unsullied, a group of eunuch slave soldiers. His name is pronounced  in Valyrian and was chosen by his Astapor slave masters, who choose new names for the Unsullied which are designed to humiliate them and make them think they are not human. Despite this, Grey Worm chose to keep his current name because it was his name on the day Daenerys freed the Unsullied, so he considers it to be a lucky name. He is loyal to Daenerys and doesn't like those who insult her. He develops feelings for Missandei, which appear to be reciprocated, and has a friendly rivalry with Daario Naharis. He is gravely injured in Meereen in an attack by the Sons of the Harpy, but ultimately survives. After Daenerys's disappearance, Grey Worm partially recovers from his injuries and remains in Meereen to help Tyrion Lannister govern the city and maintain peace with the slave masters. When the slave masters go back on the deal and attack Meereen with ships, only to be countered by Daenerys's dragons, Grey Worm kills Razdal mo Eraz and Belicho Paenymion, and later accompanies Daenerys and her retinue on their voyage to Westeros. From her stronghold on Dragonstone, Daenerys sends Grey Worm and his army to take Casterly Rock. The night before Grey Worm admits to Missandei that now he has her to love, he has begun to know what fear is. They make love. Grey Worm expects Casterly Rock to be hard to win and is surprised to find it barely defended: the capture is effected with ease. He then takes his army east and is outside King's Landing when Daenerys and Cersei meet in the Dragonpit."]}, {"page": "List of Saturday Night Live guests (A\u2013D)", "response": ["| Jacob Anderson"]}, {"page": "List of songs recorded by Plan B", "response": ["| \"I Need Love\" || Adulthood || align=\"center\"| 2008 || Featuring Jacob Anderson"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2012", "response": ["|| Director: Menhaj Huda   Cast: Geoff Bell, Adam Deacon, Jacob Anderson, Sophie Stuckey, Jessica Barden, Calum McNab"]}]}}
