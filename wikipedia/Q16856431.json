Through her network of associates he was introduced to composers, performers and music critics.

Turpin's position as Hon Sec. of the College of Organists coupled with his reputation, not only as a fine organ player but as a newspaper writer as well, naturally won for him a great deal of influence in the musical world. For a long time this manifested itself chiefly in the immense number of recitals he was asked to given in connection with the inauguration of new organs in churches, chapels, town halls, and other public buildings.Charles William Pearce, A Biographical Sketch of Edmund Hart Turpin, 1911"]}, {"page": "Lynnwood Farnam", "response": ["Walter Lynnwood Farnam was born on January 13, 1885 in Sutton, Quebec, Canada into a family of farmers and inventors.  He was named Walter after his great-great-grandfather, who gained a fortune for a plow he had invented.  However, to his friends and family he was always called \"Lynnwood\" or Lynn.  His father was Arlington I. Farnam, a farmer and inventor who also was an amateur musician of no particular talent.  His mother, Bertha Curtis n\u00e9e Wood, was a highly skilled musician with a noted ability for memorization.  He was raised on a farm in Dunham, Quebec, where both his parents had deep family ties, with the obligatory farm chores.  His first musical instructor was his mother, and then from two teachers at Dunham Ladies College.  Farnam gave credit to one of these teachers, George W. Cornish, as giving him the foundation for technical ability for which he became famous.  The first verifiable public performance took place at the age of ten.  He began giving piano lessons of his own by the age of eleven.  In 1900 he was awarded the Montreal Scholarship, enabling him to attend the Royal College of Music for three years studying under James Higgs, W. S. Hoyte, F. A. Sewell, Herbert Sharpe and Franklin Taylor.  He had spent three months in intense preparation for the scholarship exam, but the day of the examination and performance left him nervous.  His father relieved his nerves with encouragement and by massaging Lynnwood's fingers, for which Lynnwood expressed gratitude.  Because he excelled in his studies he earned an addition year of tuition at the Royal College."]}, {"page": "Higgs, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Higgs"]}, {"page": "Sophie Weisse", "response": ["Upon identifying Tovey's talent for music at the age of four, Weisse took it upon herself to manage his education. She oversaw all aspects of his education until he attended Balliol College, Oxford. Despite not being a pianist herself, Weisse had studied Ludwig Deppe's piano method and used this as the basis to teach Tovey the piano. When Tovey was an adolescent, she arranged for him to study counterpoint with Walter Parratt and James Higgs, and composition with Hubert Parry."]}]}}
