Borrowing oscillators from the Science department, Gilbert started experimenting with tape loops and delays at the recording studio set up by his predecessor. Together with Colin Newman and Angela Conway, who were students at Watford at the time, Gilbert formed a short-lived group called Overload. Newman and Gilbert were joined by Graham Lewis and Robert Gotobed in the summer of 1976, and started practising and performing as Wire."]}, {"page": "Robert Grey", "response": ["*Robert Grey (musician) (born 1951, also known as Robert Gotobed), drummer for Wire"]}, {"page": "Snakedrill", "response": ["*Robert Gotobed"]}, {"page": "The First Letter", "response": ["The First Letter is the ninth studio album and the last album released by Wire before their second extended hiatus.
