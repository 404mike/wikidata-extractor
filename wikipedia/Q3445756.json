He captained the team in the 1952-53 season and also in 1950-51 in the absence of Ken Jones.\nBurnett was unlucky only to win one cap for the Wales national rugby union team primarily because he had to compete against Cliff Morgan.\nBurnett turned town an offer of \u00a33000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately \u00a3185,500 in 2013) to change codes to rugby league and join Huddersfield.", "link_mentions": {}}}
