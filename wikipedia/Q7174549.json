By April the following year Hodkinson had beaten Frenchman Raymond Armand to win the vacant European title in two rounds, and won a Lonsdale belt outright when he stopped Peter Harris, defending his British title.", "Hodkinson then defended his European title against rugged Frenchman Farid Benredjeb. Like Peter Harris the \u2018teak-tough\u2019 Algerian had never been stopped or been on the canvas before meeting Hodkinson and his French handlers, the Acaries brothers considered Benredjeb to be un-stoppable. Showing what an exciting fighter he is, Hodkinson put on a display of powerful combination punching with great accuracy and hand speed to stop the challenger. Hodkinson had outclassed the best in Europe and was ready to fight at the highest level. In March 1990 at the G-Mex Manchester Hodkinson fought in a world title final eliminator when he stopped Mexican Eduardo Montoya in three rounds, but not before he was on the canvas himself for the first time in his professional career. In the first round Hodkinson had the Mexican down twice and moved in to finish when Montoya was apparently there for the taking. Carelessly Hodkinson was caught by a sucker right hand and paid the penalty. The Mexican wasn\u2019t in as much trouble as he appeared to be in, and Hodkinson, misjudged the situation as did everyone else in the audience.", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Peter Harris", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Peter Harris"]}, {"page": "List of British featherweight boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Peter Harris"]}, {"page": "Boxing in Wales", "response": ["|align=left | Peter Harris"]}, {"page": "Robert Dickie", "response": ["Dickie is one of four Welshmen to have won the British super-featherweight title, alongside Neil Haddock, Floyd Harvard and Gary Buckland; and is one of five Welsh boxers to have taken the British featherweight title, the others being Jim Driscoll, Peter Harris, Steve Sims and Howard Winstone."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Peter Harris", "|align=left | Peter Harris", "|align=left | Peter Harris"]}, {"page": "Kelvin Smart", "response": ["Smart didn't fight throughout 1985 and on his return in January 1986, he took a narrow points decision over Midlands area bantamweight champion Rocky Lawlor.
