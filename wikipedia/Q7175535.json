Sir Henry's grandson, Peter Lunn, recalled, \"My grandfather said 'Push him over the Reichenbach Falls' and Conan Doyle hadn\u2019t heard of them, so he showed them to him.\" So impressed was Doyle that he decided to let his hero die there."]}, {"page": "Operation Gold", "response": ["The covert construction of the  tunnel under the world's most heavily patrolled border to intersect a series of cable less than  below a busy street was an exceptional engineering challenge. Using a shield method of construction, which pushed forward on hydraulic rams, the resultant space was lined with sand and 1,700 cast-iron lining plates. A wooden railway track acted as a guide for the rubber-wheeled construction vehicles, which by end of construction had removed  of material. This included a number of evacuations, including when the diggers broke through into an undocumented pre-World War II cesspool and flooded the tunnel. Throughout all stages of construction and in operational use, the entire tunnel was rigged with explosives, designed to ensure its complete destruction. Once complete, the tunnel ran into the Altglienicke area of the Treptow borough, where British Army Captain Peter Lunn\u2014a former alpine skier, who was actually the head of the SIS in Berlin\u2014personally undertook the tapping of the three cables. The British also installed most of the electronic handling equipment in the tunnel, which was manufactured and badged as British made."]}, {"page": "Arnold Lunn", "response": ["Towards the end of 1913 Lunn married Mabel Northcote, the granddaughter of Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh.

She was the first woman to pass the British First Class skiing test, and she was a founder member of the Kandahar Ski Club.Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 47. When her brother became 3rd Earl of Iddesleigh in 1927, she acquired the courtesy title of \"Lady Mabel\". Her husband wrote: \"In the aristocracy of M\u00fcrren she welcomed this modest reminder of the fact that inventing the Slalom was not the only Lunn claim to respect.\" The Swiss, however, could never understand how Arnold could be \"Mr. Lunn\" and his wife \"Lady Mabel\", and their feelings were aptly conveyed by a member of the Kandahar who congratulated him when he was knighted \"on making an honest Lady out of Mabel.\"Lunn, Arnold.
