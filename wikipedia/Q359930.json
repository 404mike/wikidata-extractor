He was a proponent of spiritualism, and an opponent of capital punishment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Austin Osman Spare", "response": ["Austin Osman Spare (30 December 1886 \u2013 15 May 1956) was an English artist and occultist who worked as both a draughtsman and a painter. Influenced by symbolism and art nouveau his art was known for its clear use of line,\"In the verity of his visionary productions we find him of the company of Blake and Fuseli and their circle; but far superior to any of them in the mastery of representational craft.\" His comeditative magical art is a dynamic framework of Tantric energy\u2014which is to say contains absolute, real, intrivalent and of cosmological transcendental\u2014proportions. It is similar to the language amalgamations in the book of Abramelin. Haydn Mackey, commenting in a radio program broadcast shortly after Spare's death, and; \"There now hang on one of my walls seven of his paintings, each so different in style and character that it is almost impossible to believe that the same hand was responsible for any two of them. And there rest on a table in my sitting-room overlooking Trafalgar Square three sketchbooks full of 'automatic drawings' unique in their mastery of line, unique, too, in their daring of conception.\" Hannen Swaffer, \"The Mystery of an Artist\" in London Mystery Magazine, Vol. 1, No. 5, Hulton Press, 1950 and its depiction of monstrous and sexual imagery.\"On Austin Osman Spare\" in Joseph Nechvatal, \"Towards an Immersive Intelligence: Essays on the Work of Art in the Age of Computer Technology and Virtual Reality (1993\u20132006)\" Edgewise Press. 2009, pp. 40-52 In an occult capacity, he developed idiosyncratic magical techniques including automatic writing, automatic drawing and sigilization based on his theories of the relationship between the conscious and unconscious self.", "In October 1907 Spare held his first major exhibition, titled simply \"Black and White Drawings by Austin O Spare\", at the Bruton Gallery in London's West End. Attracting widespread interest and sensational views in the press, he was widely compared to Aubrey Beardsley, with reviewers commenting on what they saw as the eccentric and grotesque nature of his work. The World commented that \"his inventive faculty is stupendous and terrifying in its creative flow of impossible horrors\", while The Observer noted that \"Mr. Spare's art is abnormal, unhealthy, wildly fantastic and unintelligible\".Baker 2011. pp. 47\u201348.Keith Richmond, \"Discord in the Garden of Janus - Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare\", in Austin Osman Spare: Artist - Occultist - Sensualist, Beskin Press, 1999. On the other hand, he could, and often did, produce straightforward works of art as fine as any by Durer or Rembrandt, as his friend Hannen Swaffer once observed.", "Spare held exhibitions of his work at the St. George's Gallery in Hanover Square in 1927, and then at the Lefevre Gallery in 1929, but his work received little praise in the press or attention from the public.Baker 2011. pp. 157\u2013158. Two major supporters of Spare died around this time, in the form of his father in 1928, and then his primary patron Pickford Waller in 1930, although at his 1927 exhibit (titled \"The Journey of the Soul Through Death to Rebirth\") he did gain an important new patron and friend in the form of journalist Hannen Swaffer.Baker 2011. pp. 157, 160. Living in poverty and with his work becoming unpopular in the mainstream London art scene, Spare contemplated suicide.Baker 2011. p. 160. He then undertook a series of anamorphic portraits, predominantly of young women, which he termed the \"Experiments in Reality\". Influenced by the work of El Greco, they were exhibited at the Godfrey Phillips Galleries in St James's, Central London in November 1930, an exhibit that proved to be Spare's last in London's West End.Baker 2011. pp. 162\u2013164. In 1932, he moved into a flat at 148 York Road, Waterloo, from where he would hold art shows that had been co-organised by G.S. Sandilands of the Royal College of Art. He proceeded to move to Lambeth for a while, and then in 1936 to Elephant and Castle, a poverty-stricken working class area of South London, where he set up his home in the flat at 56a Walworth Road, situated above the loading bay of a Woolworth's store.Baker 2011. pp. 165\u2013166. He would often be visited at his flat by friends and people interested in purchasing his work, and formed friendships with both Dennis Bardens, whom he had met through Victor Neuberg, Oswell Blakeston and Frank Letchford.Baker 2011. pp. 167\u2013170, 180\u2013181.", "In failing health, in May 1956 he was submitted to the South Western Hospital in Stockwell with a burst appendix; the doctor noted that he had also been suffering from anaemia, bronchitis, high blood pressure and gall stones. Rushing to see him at his hospital bed, it was here that Spare's two dearest friends, Kenneth Grant and Frank Letchford, met one another for the first time. Spare died on the afternoon of 15 May 1956, at the age of 69.Baker 2011. p. 256. In his will, Spare left Letchford his first choice of 15 pictures, with Grant getting the second choice of 10 others, along with all of his books and papers. His funeral was paid for by his friend Hannen Swaffer, and he was buried alongside his father at St. Mary's Church in Ilford."]}, {"page": "Tell England", "response": ["The novel received mixed reviews when first published. Hannen Swaffer, writing in  the Daily Graphic, considered it \"a book of penetrating analysis, a volume that illumines the souls of thousands ... a book that will be read proudly wherever English people live ... a book which will live as long as our spoken tongue\". In contrast, the Evening Standard found it \"laughable \u2013 when it is not revolting by reason of the sentimentality with which the autobiography of Rupert Ray is sticky from cover to cover\". Rose Macaulay, writing in the Daily News, thought it \"apparently by a rather illiterate and commonplace sentimentalist\", and considered that the book had \"no beauty, and its silliness and bad taste are not the work of a writer\".

His reputation for using outlandish instruments and inflated orchestral resources is, however, generally undeserved: most of his large-scale works are scored for the modern symphony orchestra as used in the early twentieth century. Hannen Swaffer, a writer for The Graphic, referred humorously to Holbrooke on several occasions as \"The Cockney Wagner\",Brown, Hubert: Stars of the record world (Gramophone), reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.83, 90) although the only real similarity between the two was a predeliction for mythological music drama:"]}, {"page": "The Press Awards", "response": ["Established in 1962 by The People and World's Press News, the first award ceremony for the then-named Hannen Swaffer Awards, named after journalist Hannen Swaffer, was held in 1963.
