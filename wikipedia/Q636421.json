Soon after, his professional cyclist license was revoked after an altercation with another cyclist.  His attendance at the 1908 Olympics was thus in question until he was finally reinstated just before the event.\nIn 1908 he won the gold medal in the 5000 metres competition as well as in the team pursuit as member of the British team. He also won a silver medal in the 20 kilometres event. He competed in the 660 yards competition but was eliminated in the semi-finals. In the sprint event he participated in the final and came second, but the pre-arranged time limit was exceeded, resulting in the race being declared void and no medals being awarded.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cycling at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Benjamin JonesClarence KingsburyLeonard MeredithErnest Payne"]}, {"page": "Ben Jones", "response": ["*Benjamin Jones (cyclist) (1882\u20131963), British 1908 Olympic gold medalist and Empire Games champion", "*Benjamin Jones (economist) (born 1972), professor at Kellogg School of Management", "*Benjamin Jones (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Benjamin Jones"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 660 yards", "response": ["|align=center| 1 || Benjamin Jones ||  ||align=center| 59.0 ||align=center| ", "|align=center| 3 || Benjamin Jones ||  ||align=center| Unknown || "]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metres", "response": ["|align=center| 1 || Benjamin Jones ||  ||align=center| 9:08.8 ||align=center| ", "|align=center|  || Benjamin Jones ||  ||align=center| 8:36.2"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 20 kilometres", "response": ["|align=center| 1 || Benjamin Jones ||  ||align=center| 32:39.0 ||align=center| ", "|align=center|  || Benjamin Jones ||  ||align=center| Unknown"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's sprint", "response": ["| 1 ||align=left| Benjamin Jones ||align=left|  || 1:35.0 || ", "| 1 ||align=left| Benjamin Jones ||align=left|  || 1:40.8 || ", "|align=left| Benjamin Jones ||align=left| "]}, {"page": "Springfield Park (Wigan)", "response": ["The concrete cycle track featured a home straight 29\u00a0ft (approx 9m) wide, while the banking was 24\u00a0ft wide, rising 7\u00a0ft.
