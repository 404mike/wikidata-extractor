Soon after, his professional cyclist license was revoked after an altercation with another cyclist.  His attendance at the 1908 Olympics was thus in question until he was finally reinstated just before the event.\nIn 1908 he won the gold medal in the 5000 metres competition as well as in the team pursuit as member of the British team. He also won a silver medal in the 20 kilometres event. He competed in the 660 yards competition but was eliminated in the semi-finals. In the sprint event he participated in the final and came second, but the pre-arranged time limit was exceeded, resulting in the race being declared void and no medals being awarded.", "link_mentions": {}}}
