His work has been translated into 20 languages. His grandfather was a historian, and was one of the main influences on his work. He is best known for the children's novel Cue for Treason (1940).\nTrease's children's historical novels reflect his insistence on historically correct backgrounds, which he meticulously researched. His ground-breaking study Tales Out of School (1949) pioneered the idea that children's literature should be a serious subject for study and debate.  When he began his career, his radical viewpoint was a change from the conventional and often jingoistic tone of most children's literature of the time, and he was one of the first authors who deliberately set out to appeal to both boys and girls and to feature strong leading characters of both sexes.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Children's literature", "response": ["Geoffrey Trease and Rosemary SutcliffHunt, 1995, (p. 208\u2013209) brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel.

Evidence of his craft was seen in his tactics, which included feigned retreats, ambushes and the use of false information. For example, before fleeing Milanese territory in 1391, Hawkwood accepted his opponent's challenge to meet on the battlefield next morning. However, Hawkwood \"picked up camp and quietly escaped through back routes, placing his battle standards and banners high on the trees so that the enemy would assume he was still there. He then detached a contingent of his men and placed them in the woods to entrap the enemy as it pursued [him].\" His troops would rape women, murder peasants and dismember their enemies. This has brought Hawkwood's religious faith into question. He was known to sack monasteries and holy places, such as the Abbey of San Galgano. He even harassed the Pope in Avignon, but there is also evidence that he was not completely godless, as he requested a portable altar for Mass while on campaign. Geoffrey Trease gives \"fidelity\" as his main characteristic, because of his persistent commitment to fulfilling orders from his employers. However, this is untrue, as he often flouted contracts and disobeyed employers. In one case, he abandoned the Milanese army twice."]}, {"page": "Penrith, Cumbria", "response": ["Penrith was used as a setting in the 1940 book Cue for Treason by Geoffrey Trease.

The first change came in England in the 1930s, most notably in Geoffrey Trease's groundbreaking Bows Against the Barons.

As early as 1934, when he wrote Bows Against the Barons..., he was determined... to show not the glamour of its hero, but the brutal conditions in which the peasants lived.
