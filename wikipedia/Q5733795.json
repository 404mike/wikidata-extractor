In 1918 Rendall had stood as a supporter of the Coalition government of David Lloyd George. He was not opposed by the Conservatives, though he did defeat a National Party candidate, and had presumably been in receipt of the Coalition Coupon. However, by 1920 he had fallen out with the Coalition, writing to his local Liberal Association to explain that he was dissatisfied by what he described as the government's tremendous and unjustified commitment of British money and lives in  Mesopotamia at the same time as their inability to end waste and extravagance at home.The Times, 14 July 1920 p14 He went and sat on the opposition benches."]}, {"page": "List of deputy lieutenants of Gloucestershire", "response": ["* Herbert Charles Woodcock"]}]}}
