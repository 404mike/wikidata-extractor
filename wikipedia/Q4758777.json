Tylecote", "response": ["Having originally married Angela (n\u00e9e Lias, daughter of journalist and writer Godfrey Lias) whom he divorced in 1950, he married his second wife, Elizabeth Cornelia Johanna (n\u00e9e Reventlow) in 1958. Elizabeth was born in the city of S\u00f8nderborg in 1912, which was then part of Schleswig-Holstein, but became part of Denmark after 1918. Having been born in S\u00f8nderborg Castle, she had previously changed her name to Berndt, to avoid association with pro-Nazi elements of the aristocratic Reventlow family, and spent much of World War II in Palestine and Egypt. Both Ronald and Elizabeth Tylecote maintained pro-Communist sympathies until the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956. His son, Andrew Tylecote is an economist."]}, {"page": "Tylecote family", "response": ["* Andrew Tylecote (born 1946), British economist"]}, {"page": "Tylecote, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Tylecote"]}]}}
