It is shown in a prologue webisode that Becker went with Sarah to the future to try find Abby, Connor and Danny, during which Sarah was killed. This has left Becker shaken, feeling that Sarah's death was his fault. He did not get along with Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) at first but slowly came to accept him. He is friendly with Jess Parker (Ruth Kearney), but is unaware she has feelings for him. After having one of Matt's EMD weapons used on him to test their capabilities, Becker agrees to use them. He is greatly relieved when Abby and Connor return, jokingly asking if they bought him a souvenir. In episode 4.3, he is adamant about enforcing the new policy to not allow any expeditions through the anomaly when Matt is missing and finally relents, but blames him when \"tree creepers\" cause trouble later. In episode 4.4, he is bitten by a Therocephalian and poisoned by its venom, but recovers and is forced to go on medical leave. In episode 4.6 he searches for the psychopath Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne) who is causing problems for the ARC and gets caught in a trap rigged up to a bomb, but Jess saves him.

In episode 4.1, he debriefs Abby and Connor when they return and tells them they no longer have field positions, but in the next episode Lester rehires them despite his objections. In episode 4.3, he has Connor do minor work in the ARC to spite him after he was placed back on the team, but is thankful when Connor saves him from dying and sees his true potential. In episode 4.4, he attempts to have the creatures in the ARC killed because of their inconvenience, but Lester blackmails him in dropping the matter. In episode 4.5, he recruits Connor to head up his own team of anomaly researchers after they discover vital new data. In episode 4.7, Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) confronts Philip about knowing Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) and doing research with her after finding his name on a document on her body, and despite denying this all he is clearly agitated. Connor later tells Philip about a potential disaster to be caused by the anomalies; Philip assures him they will solve the issue themselves and do not need to tell the others.", "Her presence is still felt strongly in the fourth series, as the ARC team speculate her fate; when Danny returns in the finale, he confirms that Helen is dead \"as a dodo\" to Lester, who responds happily: \"Excellent\". Danny also tells Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) and Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley) that Helen and Philip Burton (Alexander Siddig) worked together studying the anomalies, and that Burton is not to be trusted. In the fifth series, Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) discovered an audio of Helen encouraging Philip to find a way to make the future better by using the anomalies. However, in the series finale Philip realised Helen had tricked him by stroking his ego, having intended for his attempt at making green energy with the anomalies to wipe out humans much like her later plan, likely done in case she failed in her attempt to wipe out early humans.", "When Charlotte was sick, Ethan accompanied her and Emily to find an anomaly leading to a place with medicine, and arrived in the present, but she died. Angered over her death, Ethan blamed Emily as he believed her rules had caused them to be too late. He soon followed Emily and took up residence across from Matt Anderson's (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) flat, and when he left Ethan kidnapped her. In episode 4.5, he had decided that as the only two to have known Charlotte, they were going to have their own funeral. He drove them to a cemetery where he told Emily he also blamed his family for what had happened to him and was going to make them suffer, and bound and gagged Emily inside a coffin before he fled from Matt. During episode 4.6, and after laying a trap for anyone who might come looking for him in the flat, went to his old home to find that a neighbour recognised him and claimed to be someone else before leaving. In episode 4.7, while attempting to leave through another anomaly, he was caught after he encountered his brother Danny, revealing to everyone that he was Patrick. Captured and taken to the ARC, he told Danny what had happened to make him disappear, but said he was unhappy in the modern era, and escaped, taking the still-alive Emily as a hostage. Before he went through an anomaly to the Pliocene he ignored Emily's attempts to get him to stop, and left her at the mercy of a terror bird. He was soon followed by Danny, who wanted to keep him from hurting anyone else.", "Throughout the beginning of the fourth series, it is implied that he and Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) were working on a secret mission involving the ARC. He seemed desperate that they achieve their goal, warning Matt to keep an eye on the other members of the ARC and be wary of everyone, particularly Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) and Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) when they returned after a year in the Cretaceous. In episode 4.3 he is revealed to be dying because of an undisclosed illness, but had accepted his fate and wanted Matt to forget about him as he wasn't important. He wasn't happy in episode 4.5 when Matt risked everything to rescue Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley) from Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne), and Gideon feared that Ethan was connected to their mission, and ordered Matt to use Emily as bait. By episode 4.6, he is close to death, and apologises to Matt for not allowing him to get close to anyone, as it was for everyone's own good, and before he died he asked Matt to complete their mission. Matt then revealed to Emily that Gideon was his father. In episode 4.7, it is revealed that he has travelled back in time from a sterile future Earth in order to prevent this future from happening.", "In Series 4, Lester is a subordinate to Philip Burton (Alexander Siddig), whom he dislikes greatly, after the government makes a deal for Burton's company to subsidise the ARC and anomaly research. He is somewhat pleased by Abby and Connor's return, though he has to follow orders and have them fired due to new policies, but later finds a loophole to get them back on the team. He defies Burton's plan to kill the creatures in the ARC's menagerie, by blackmailing him with the fact that when the anomalies inevitably go public he will expose Burton as \"the dinosaur killer\" in sympathy for an upset Abby. In episode 4.5 he helps Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) locate Victorian-era woman Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley), and in the next episode is informed of the Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne) situation before he marries Jenny and her fianc\u00e9 with special power from the Prime Minister. In the series finale he couldn't been more happier when Danny returned with the news that Helen was \"as dead as a dodo\".", "Later though in Series 4 of Primeval an anomaly opens in a mansion where Jenny and her fianc\u00e9 are to be wed. Although she did not want to bump into them she invites them to the wedding. Connor then reopens the anomaly after locking it and releases two prehistoric carnivorous mammals, Hyaenodon, on the loose causing havoc. Fortunately, Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin), Jenny, Abby, Connor and Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley) take care of the creatures, and Lester marries Jenny and her fianc\u00e9.", "In the fifth series she learned of Matt's mission and lent her help, though her relationship with Connor became strained as she couldn't tell him why she was trying to stop his obsessive work for Philip. In episode 5.3, she wasn't happy when Connor's new assistant April Leonard (Janice Byrne) suggested that she was nothing but a distraction for him, and this emboldened her to copy Connor's hard drive, despite refusing Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) earlier requests. When he caught her near his lab she tried to appeal to him by revealing Helen and Philip's association, though his apparent knowledge made him adamant she only wanted him away from Philip, creating further tension between them. She was furious at him when he opened his own anomaly in the ARC in episode 5.4, and set out to find Rex when he was loose in the ARC with an imminent gamma ray to kill a swarm of future beetles. In episode 5.5, she rescued Connor from a Kaprosuchus after he had been abandoned by Philip, and the two made up as Connor had realised he should have trusted Abby over Philip. At the \"New Dawn\" facility she threatened April with her EMD, and tried to go after Connor when he was pulled through the anomaly as it opened. In the series finale she and Matt go to rescue him from a pack of mutated Future Predators, and encourages Connor to return when he gives up hope, whispering something in his ear. After returning she comes up with a plan to paralyse the Future Predators in the ARC by using high frequency sounds, and once the crisis is over she asks Connor to marry her (what she told him in the future), which he agreed to.", "She and Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne) brought a sick woman, their friend Charlotte Cameron, to modern London in the hope of finding medical treatment. After Charlotte died she returned to the Cretaceous, but Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) brought her back thinking she was from the present and been attacked by a \"tree creeper\". She then asked him to keep her presence secret while she tried to find Ethan. In episode 4.4 she was kidnapped by Ethan from Matt's flat. In episode 4.5 Ethan took her to a cemetery and left her tied and gagged in a coffin, until she was rescued by Matt. She forms a close relationship with Matt, but in episode 4.6, she is revealed to have been married before she went through the anomalies, but told Matt that she had only married out of her father's wishes and had never loved him. In episode 4.7 she returns to the 19th century so as not to distract Matt from his mission to save humanity, which he admitted after she figured out he wasn't from the present day.", "Jess accidentally released the Dracorex from the ARC's manergerie in the beginning of Series 4, and later coordinated the team as they dealt with a Spinosaurus that had followed Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) and Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) through the Anomaly. She was sympathetic towards Connor as his job had been rendered unnecessary since his disappearance, and offered for him and Abby to stay at her flat. When Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) was gone she asked him to get her some chocolates but he forgot, however Becker got her some, leaving her flustered as she later asked about the old team and Becker. She didn't seem to realise the seriousness of the job until she witnessed a teenager being killed on CCTV footage in episode 4.4. She was afraid when Becker was poisoned by a creature, but relieved when he recovered and tried comforting him. In episode 4.6, she joins Becker on his stakeout to catch Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne) and instead of fleeing a trap that Becker was caught in stayed to disarm the bomb, and she hugged him in relief.", "Danny returned in the episode 4.7, having survived his time in the Pliocene. However, as he came through the anomaly he was shot by Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) with an EMD. He woke up sometime later, relieved to be back. While the team were also dealing with a man named Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne), Danny helped Abby and Connor in sending a Terror Bird through a satellite anomaly. When Ethan held Danny at gunpoint, he recognised him as his brother Patrick, who had survived his encounter with the camouflage beast and had been driven mad while going through the anomalies. He reported Helen's death to a pleased Lester, and was suspicious of Philip Burton (Alexander Siddig) when they met, having found a document on Helen's body with Philip's name on it. While speaking with Patrick he pleaded to be allowed to go through the anomaly, only to be knocked out. He and Matt went after Patrick, who escaped into the Pliocene. Danny decided to follow him, unwilling to risk Patrick making it to another human inhabited era. Before he departed he left a warning to Matt that Philip couldn't be trusted, asking him to warn the others.", "In episode 5.1, Philip shows him his machine called \"New Dawn\", from which he hopes to take energy from anomalies and turn it into green energy, and assigned Connor an assistant named April Leonard (Janice Byrne) when he agreed to help. He was later taken by a burrowing creature from the future, but survived, and came up with a plan to blow up the rest of the creatures in a warehouse. In episode 5.3, Connor was kept busy by April, and when he caught Abby near his lab she tried to appeal to him by revealing Helen and Philip's association, though Philip had told him this already (having made him believe Helen had only known of Philip), and was adamant Abby only wanted him away from Philip, creating further tension between them. At the end of the episode he created his own anomaly in the ARC, and in episode 5.4 told Abby he only wanted to do what he thought what would make Cutter proud, and his anomaly caused a swarm of future beetles to invade the ARC. Connor tried to make up for what he had done, and came up with a plan to kill all the beetles by closing his anomaly and unleashing a gamma ray, though only after Abby and Matt Anderson (Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin) revealed they possessed a copy of his laptop's hard drive (which Matt had earlier blasted) in order to allow this. He later learned that Philip had tried to blow the building up, and then went through Prospero's files, learning of Philip and Helen's  partnership and that Philip had created a larger version of his machine. In episode 5.5, he attempted to slow down Philip on the way to \"New Dawn\", but when a Kaprosuchus attacked Philip refused to believe Connor's claims that \"New Dawn\" would destroy the world and was left behind. After being rescued by Abby, the two made up as Connor realised he should have trusted Abby over Philip. At the \"New Dawn\" facility he tried to go sabotage \"New Dawn\", only to fail and fall through the anomaly as it opened. In the series finale he is rescued from a pack of Future Predators by Abby and Matt. He gave up hope until Abby whispered something in his ear which convinced him to continue. After returning he came up with a plan to merge his anomaly with the \"New Dawn\" one, which succeeded as it imploded. Once the crisis was over, it was revealed Abby had asked Connor to marry her while they had been in the future, which he agreed to."]}, {"page": "True Dare Kiss", "response": ["* Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin as Bryce Waghorn"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2001", "response": ["| To End All Wars || David L.
