Bob and Chris Herbert, the two men who had earlier created the Spice Girls, thought the time was right for a male group. Over 3,000 hopefuls auditioned, including Russell Brand, and they were finally narrowed down to only 14, five of whom had arranged themselves into a group while waiting for their audition. The auditions resulted in a provisional casting of nine members: Richard Breen (now better known as Abz Love), Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, Sean Conlon, Jason \"J\" Brown, and stand-by members Peter Cheshire, Paul Taylor, Anthony Baker (rapper) and Ric Hershon. Because his first name was Richard, Breen created the nickname 'Abs' (from his middle name, \"Abidin\") to avoid confusion with Neville (born Richard Neville Dobson). Cheshire and Taylor were later cut when the final five were chosen in May 1997 and Hershon could not attend the final selection. Baker made it into the band originally, but doubt was cast over his rapping style as his North East accent came through.", "* Abz Love (1997\u20132001, 2006\u20132007, 2012\u20132014)", " bar:Abz     text:\"Abz Love\""]}, {"page": "Scott Robinson (singer)", "response": ["In 1997, Robinson auditioned for Five, a new boy band-style group with \"attitude and edge\".
