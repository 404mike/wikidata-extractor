In 1946, he was appointed groundsman/professional at Hull C.C., and took a similar post at Headingley in 1964. He was stated to have scored 30,000 runs, and taken 3,000 wickets during a long successful career which was interrupted by World War II, during which he was a glider pilot.\nEarly on 19 August 1975, Cawthray discovered that campaigners calling for the release from prison of George Davis, had dug holes in the pitch and poured oil over one end of the wicket. This led to the match between England and Australia being abandoned. The match was declared a draw, denying England of the chance to win back the Ashes.He retired as groundsman at Headingley in 1978, aged 65, and died in January 2001, at the age of 87.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
