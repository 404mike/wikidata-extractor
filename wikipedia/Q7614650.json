He committed the first offence in the late 1980s, when the girl was 14 years old, and he was her coach. The judge said that Sutton had \"interfered with her sexually in a gross and disgraceful way\" and \"abused [his] role to an inexcusable degree\". Sutton was given a two-year sentence which was suspended partly because, in the words of the judge, \"a large number of leading athletes will suffer disadvantage from your absence from the scene\". Reporter Steven Downes believes that Sutton escaped jail because the judge did not want to cost Australia any Olympic medals. After the trial, Sutton was banned for life from coaching in Australia, and Sutton's marriage ended in divorce."]}, {"page": "Stephen Downes (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Steven Downes (born 1961), English sports journalist"]}, {"page": "Downes, Steven", "response": ["#redirectSteven Downes"]}]}}
