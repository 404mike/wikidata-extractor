He also appeared for England on the wing.\nGuscott was born in Bath, Somerset, one of the two sons of hospital porter Henry Guscott and his wife Sue, and was educated at Ralph Allen School. He played for his home city throughout his career, most of which was during the amateur era. Guscott was originally a bricklayer, briefly drove buses for Badgerline in Bath, then worked for British Gas in a public-relations role before the game turned professional. During the English off season of 1987, Guscott travelled to Australia and played for Wollongong Waratahs RFC in the Illawarra District Rugby Union competition. Later in his career he also secured work as a fashion model. On 17 November 2016, Guscott was inducted to the World Rugby Hall of Fame during the opening ceremonies for the Hall's first physical location in Rugby, Warwickshire.Known for his smooth running style, Guscott was often considered one of the finest ball-players of any rugby age. Former England Coach Clive Woodward called Guscott the \"Prince of Centres\", and rugby-writer Stephen Jones hails Guscott as part of his 'dream centre combination', along with former New Zealand All Black Frank Bunce.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Jeremy Guscott \u2013 BBC Sport 1996\u2013present, ITV Sport 1999, OSN 2015"]}, {"page": "Martin Johnson (rugby union)", "response": ["Johnson was selected to captain the 1997 British Lions tour of South Africa. The Lions convincingly won the first test at Newlands 25\u201316 with Neil Jenkins kicking five penalties and Matt Dawson and Alan Tait scoring tries. Despite scoring three tries in the second test at Durban, the Springboks suffered from some woeful goal kicking and failed to land any penalties or conversions, while for the Lions Neil Jenkins once again kicked five penalties to level the scores at 15\u201315 before Jeremy Guscott dropped a goal for an 18\u201315 lead for the Lions. The Lions then held off a ferocious South African fightback, Lawrence Dallaglio putting in a try-saving tackle, to win the match 18\u201315 and take the series. The third test at Ellis Park proved a match too far for the Lions squad and they lost 35\u201316. The tour was seen as a triumph for the Lions management of Fran Cotton (manager), Ian McGeechan (head coach), Jim Telfer (assistant coach) and especially Johnson as captain."]}, {"page": "Bath Rugby", "response": ["Well known Bath players from the recent history of the club include Jeremy Guscott; Dan Lyle, one of the first Americans to play regularly in Britain; England captain Phil de Glanville; and Andy Robinson, an assistant coach of the Rugby World Cup \u2013 winning England side, who went on to be the England team's head coach and head coach of Scotland.", "| Nigel Redman, Richard Hill, Jeremy Guscott, Jonathan Webb", "| Ben Clarke, Graham Dawe, Jeremy Guscott, John Mallett, Jonathan Callard, Phil de Glanville, Mike Catt, Steve Ojomoh, Victor Ubogu", "| Victor Ubogu, Phil de Glanville, Jeremy Guscott, Mike Catt, Matt Perry"]}, {"page": "Will Carling", "response": ["Carling played for Rosslyn Park and then joined Harlequins, where he specialised as a centre. In 1988, he became England captain at the age of 22. He was the most successful holder of the post until Martin Johnson's period. His first match as captain was a shock win over Australia by 28\u201319. During his time he led England to back-to-back Five Nations Grand Slam victories (1991, 1992) and another Grand Slam in 1995, scoring six tries from outside centre in the Championship, and several more in other matches. While regarded as a less complete player than his centre partner, Jeremy Guscott, Carling and his team reached the final of the 1991 Rugby World Cup. After Carling's retirement as captain, no England team managed a Five (or Six) Nations Grand Slam until 2003."]}, {"page": "Phil de Glanville", "response": ["de Glanville joined Bath in 1989 and captained them to a league and cup double in 1996, partnering Jeremy Guscott in the centre for this club that season, as well as many others.

He started for Bath in the victorious 1998 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Brive.", "He made his England debut as a replacement in the match against the Springboks in 1992. Many of de Glanville's international caps were earned in a replacement role, as the incumbent centres were Will Carling (long-serving England captain) and Jeremy Guscott. De Glanville is seen as likely to have won many more caps if it weren't for this firmly entrenched Carling-Guscott combination, a pairing solidified by early Carling-Guscott successes like the 1991 Rugby World Cup."]}, {"page": "Will Greenwood", "response": ["He made his England debut in 1997. He became an important part of the England team, establishing a centre partnership with Jeremy Guscott. He later cemented his place in the England team for the Six Nations and World Cup in 2003. He formed a centre partnership with Mike Tindall or Mike Catt and wore the number 13 even if he played inside centre. He was involved in all but one of England's games in the World Cup. Although he had rushed home due to his wife's difficult pregnancy, he returned to the side, scoring England's only try against South Africa, when he followed up to touch down after a Lewis Moody charge down. His try against Wales in the quarter-final in Brisbane turned the match for England in a tight game. He finished the tournament as joint top try scorer with five."]}, {"page": "Ollie Smith (rugby union, born 1982)", "response": ["With injuries to other centres Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood, Smith was tipped by amongst others former centre Jeremy Guscott to take his place in the 2005 Six Nations side. However, Smith was overlooked in favour of Newcastle centres of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon. Tait, aged only 18, played poorly in his debut against Wales and was substituted by Olly Barkley who played in the remaining matches. Noon was solid, if unspectacular and retained his place. Some good performances from Smith in club games saw him come onto the bench for the games against Ireland, Italy and Scotland, gaining two more caps against Italy and Scotland."]}, {"page": "1997 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["|Jeremy Guscott || Centre || Bath ||  ||", "|IC ||12|| Jeremy Guscott", "|IC ||12|| Jeremy Guscott", "|OC ||13|| Jeremy Guscott || || "]}, {"page": "Jerry Guscott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jeremy Guscott"]}, {"page": "Sally Gunnell", "response": ["Gunnell worked as a television presenter, predominantly for the BBC, until 2006.

In the first test with ten minutes to go, Dawson broke from the base of a scrum and threw an overhead dummy that checked the four Springboks allowing him to scamper in for the winning try. That victory was the start of a 2\u20131 series win, clinched when he fed Jeremy Guscott for the series-winning drop goal."]}]}}
