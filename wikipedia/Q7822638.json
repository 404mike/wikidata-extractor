He played as a centre back for Gainsborough Trinity, Lincoln City, Leicester City, Hereford United and Plymouth Argyle.\nHe is best remembered at Leicester as being the player who scored the goal that kept Leicester from dropping into the 3rd tier of English football for the first time, after his 24th minute close range conversion from a corner saw Leicester beat Oxford United 1\u20130 to climb out of the relegation on the final day of the 1990-91 season, which ultimately saw the start of the club's upturn in form in the 1990s. He was also awarded the club's Player of the Year award in the same season. However a broken leg in a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 1991 and several injuries afterwards halted his progression and he never really claimed an extended run in the Leicester side after that.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tony James (footbeller born 1967)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony James (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "Tony James", "response": ["Tony James may refer to:", "*Tony James (chemist) (born 1964), professor of chemistry", "*Tony James (English footballer) (born 1967), English footballer", "*Tony James (Welsh footballer, born 1919) (1919\u20131981), Welsh footballer", "*Tony James (Welsh footballer, born 1978), Welsh footballer", "*Tony James (musician) (born 1953), English pop musician", "*Tony James (cyclist) (born 1955), British cyclist", "*Hamilton E.
