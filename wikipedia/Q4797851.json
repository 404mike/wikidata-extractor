The plan consists of a nave with aisles on both sides, an aisled chancel with a lower roofline and flanked by a vestry and an organ chamber, porches on two sides, and a tower and the west end.  This is topped with a \"good\" tall spire whose lowest stage is concealed by a parapet.  The tower is buttressed at each corner and has windows with decorative tracery, clock faces, a pinnacled upper stage and a stair turret in one corner.  The architectural style is largely Perpendicular Gothic Revival, which was out of fashion by the 1850s, although there are some Decorated Gothic Revival elements.  The architect Arthur Ashpitel, who worked extensively in Kent, was associated with Anglican evangelicalism; this may have led him to use the Perpendicular style, which was popular with that movement."]}, {"page": "Queen Eleanor Memorial Cross", "response": ["Barry based the memorial on the three surviving drawings of the Charing Cross, in the Bodleian Library, the British Museum and the collection of the Royal Society of Antiquaries.

A design was drawn up by the Arthur Ashpitel in the Perpendicular Gothic style (the Gothic Revival was popular in English architecture of this period).  The tower as built had three levels, square in plan.  The lower two levels were enclosed by walls and the uppermost level, within which a statue of Wellington was to stand, left open.  One face of the lowest (ground) level contained a door with an ogee canopy, the other three faces contained a single arch window in the centre.  The second level (first floor) had an arched window on each face, above which were circular apertures for the clock faces, surmounted by crocketted gables.  The faces were transparent to allow the clock to be lit from within the tower.  The uppermost level comprised four piers (one at each corner of the structure) atop which are trefoil cusped arches which supported a spire.  The structure is buttressed in the double angled style in which a buttress support stands on either side of the external corners (making eight in total).
