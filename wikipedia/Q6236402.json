His object in writing was to fill the gap between two substantial histories, Edward Stillingfleet's Origines Britannic\u00e6 and Gilbert Burnet's History of the Reformation. He took advice from White Kennett, and the first volume was well received if inaccurate;  when the second volume was ready he made over the copyright to the Oxford University Press, who brought it out in 1710. The two volumes covered the history of the English church from 401 to 1216. It had a vogue in its own time, and was republished, edited by John Griffiths, Oxford, 1855; but was shortly superseded by Jeremy Collier's Ecclesiastical History."]}]}}
