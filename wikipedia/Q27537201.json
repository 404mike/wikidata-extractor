He is a Consultant Ophthalmologist at the Oxford Eye Hospital and an Honorary Consultant Ophthalmologist at the Great Ormond Street Hospital. He is also an Honorary Consultant Vitreo-retinal Surgeon at the Moorfields Eye Hospital. MacLaren is an NIHR Senior Investigator, or lead researcher, for the speciality of Ophthalmology.

In findings presented in the journal \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\" in 2012, a Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology research team led by Dr Robert MacLaren from the University of Oxford restored sight to totally blind mice by injections of light-sensing cells into their eyes. The mice had suffered from a complete lack of photoreceptor cells in their retinas, and had been unable to tell light from dark. Promising results using the same treatment had been achieved with night-blind mice. Despite questions about the quality of restored vision, this treatment gives hope to people with dysfunctional vision and including degenerative eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa."]}, {"page": "Keith Martin (ophthalmologist)", "response": ["*Robert MacLaren"]}, {"page": "MacLaren, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert MacLaren"]}]}}
