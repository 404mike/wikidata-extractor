It is known that Amenhotep's brother, crown prince Thutmose, served in this role before he died. If Amenhotep inherited all his brother's roles in preparation for his accession to the throne, he might have become a high priest in Thutmose's stead. Aldred proposes that Akhenaten's unusual artistic inclinations might have been formed during his time serving Ptah, the patron god of craftsmen, whose high priest were sometimes referred to as \"The Greatest of the Directors of Craftsmanship.\"", "Other Egyptologists suggested that Akhenaten could have waged war in Syria or the Levant, possibly against the Hittites. Cyril Aldred, based on Amarna letters describing Egyptian troop movements, proposed that Akhenaten launched an unsuccessful war around the city of Gezer, while Marc Gabolde argued for an unsuccessful campaign around Kadesh. Either of these could be the campaign referred to on Tutankhamun's Restoration Stela: \"if an army was sent to Djahy [southern Canaan and Syria] to broaden the boundaries of Egypt, no success of their cause came to pass.\" John Coleman Darnell and Colleen Manassa also argued that Akhenaten fought with the Hittites for control of Kadesh, but was unsuccessful; the city was not recaptured until 60\u201370\u00a0years later, under Seti I.", "Cyril Aldred, following up earlier arguments of Grafton Elliot Smith and James Strachey, suggested that Akhenaten may have suffered from Fr\u00f6lich's syndrome on the basis of his long jaw and his feminine appearance. However, this is unlikely, because this disorder results in sterility and Akhenaten is known to have fathered numerous children. His children are repeatedly portrayed through years of archaeological and iconographic evidence."]}, {"page": "List of Egyptologists", "response": ["*Cyril Aldred (British, 1914\u20131991)"]}, {"page": "Horemheb", "response": ["* Cyril Aldred, Two monuments of the reign of \u1e24orem\u1e25ab, in: Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 54 (1968), 100\u2013106."]}, {"page": "Ramesses IX", "response": ["* Cyril Aldred, A statue of king Neferkar\u0113' Ramesses IX, JEA 41 (1955), 3-8"]}, {"page": "Allen Drury", "response": ["In 1971, Drury published The Throne of Saturn, a political/science fiction novel about the first attempt at sending a manned mission to Mars in competition with a similar Soviet effort.

The novels are based on extensive reading about the Amarna Period and, in the introduction to A God Against the Gods, he thanks at length the greatest Egyptologist of the time, Cyril Aldred, for his guidance on research. He disagreed with Aldred's view that Akhenaten's religious innovations were accepted by the supplanted religious authorities. Drury wrote, \"I am afraid my own view, conditioned by some years as a political correspondent, is much more cynical concerning the lengths to which human beings, of whatever era, will go in order to get, and keep, power.\""]}, {"page": "KV56", "response": ["Cyril Aldred suggested that the area of gold foil and plaster was in fact the remains of much rotted and flattened coffin. He suggests that, in his haste and without realising, Ayrton had cut through remains of wooden or other organic objects, which would have been reduced to a stain in the sediment, similar to the situation encountered by Guy Brunton in the tomb of Sithathoriunet at El Lahun. Robbers had entered the tomb in antiquity and looted most of the burial; their entrance was left open for some time, allowing mud and debris to wash in and accumulate before finally flood action sealed the tomb again. Reeves suggests that the tomb was robbed when already partially filled with mud, resulting only pieces visible above the infill being taken. The silver hands, in Aldred's opinion, held the decayed hands of a mummy, as Ayrton retrieved eight of the gold rings from the mud inside. He suggests that the tomb was not a cache of objects but originally contained the burial of a young princess, likely not more than four years old."]}, {"page": "Morley College", "response": ["* Cyril Aldred (1914\u20131991), art historian"]}, {"page": "World of Art", "response": ["| Egyptian Art || Cyril Aldred || 1980"]}, {"page": "Mutemwiya", "response": ["While she occasionally was identified by some researchers as a daughter of King Artatama I of Mitanni, no evidence proves that she is the same person, and nothing about her own background is known.Betsy Bryan, The Reign of Thutmose IV, (Johns Hopkins University Press: 1991), p.119 There seemed to be evidence that she was not a daughter of Artatama,Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, (Blackwell Books: 1992), p.221 but this theory has been discarded.O'Connor, David and Cline, Eric H.
