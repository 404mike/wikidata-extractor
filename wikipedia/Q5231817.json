During national service (1952-4) he studied Russian and was commissioned in the Intelligence Corps. He taught in secondary schools before becoming music librarian of the University of London, working at Senate House 1959\u201362. In 1962 he became a lecturer at the University of Southampton, becoming senior lecturer in 1970 and reader in 1975; he was awarded a doctorate for his book on Thomas Weelkes in 1971. His book on Mikhail Glinka (published 1974) was the first major study of the composer in English. This was surpassed by his four volume study of Tchaikovsky (published between 1978 and 1991), both a biography and in-depth analyses of Tchaikovsky\u2019s works. He was also editor of the New Grove Russian Masters series, and served on the editorial committee of Musica Britannica, the national collection of British music. He retired as Professor of Musicology in 1989.\nHe died in Romsey, Hampshire aged 84 after suffering from Alzheimer's disease.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cholera", "response": ["* Tchaikovsky's death has traditionally been attributed to cholera, most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier.Brown, Man and Music, 430\u201332; Holden, 371; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 269\u2013270.

Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies through Franz Becker, an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school; however, the results, according to musicologist David Brown, were \"negligible\".Brown, The Early Years, 43.", "Rubinstein was impressed by Tchaikovsky's musical talent on the whole and cited him as \"a composer of genius\" in his autobiography.Poznansky, Eyes, 47\u201348; Rubinstein, 110. He was less pleased with the more progressive tendencies of some of Tchaikovsky's student work.Brown, The Early Years, 76; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 35. Nor did he change his opinion as Tchaikovsky's reputation grew.Tchaikovsky ascribed Rubinstein's coolness to a difference in musical temperaments. Rubinstein could have been jealous professionally of Tchaikovsky's greater impact as a composer. Homophobia might have been another factor (Poznansky, Eyes, 29).An exception to Rubinstein's antipathy was the Serenade for Strings, which he declared \"Tchaikovsky's best piece\" when he heard it in rehearsal. \"At last this St. Petersburg pundit, who had growled with such consistent disapproval at Tchaikovsky's successive compositions, had found a work by his former pupil which he could endorse\", according to Tchaikovsky biographer David Brown (Brown, The Years of Wandering, 121). He and Zaremba clashed with Tchaikovsky when he submitted his First Symphony for performance by the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg. Rubinstein and Zaremba refused to consider the work unless substantial changes were made. Tchaikovsky complied but they still refused to perform the symphony.Brown, The Early Years, 100\u2013101. Tchaikovsky, distressed that he had been treated as though he were still their student, withdrew the symphony. It was given its first complete performance, minus the changes Rubinstein and Zaremba had requested, in Moscow in February 1868.Brown, New Grove vol. 18, p. 608.", "Biographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was homosexual.Poznansky, Quest, 32 et passim.

His first love was reportedly Sergey Kireyev, a younger fellow student at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence. According to Modest Tchaikovsky, this was Pyotr Ilyich's \"strongest, longest and purest love.\" The degree to which the composer might have felt comfortable with his sexual desires has, however, remained open to debate. It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky, according to musicologist and biographer David Brown, \"felt tainted within himself, defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape\"Brown, The Early Years, 50. or whether, according to Alexander Poznansky, he experienced \"no unbearable guilt\" over his sexual desires and \"eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality\u00a0... without experiencing any serious psychological damage.\"Poznansky, as quoted in Holden, 394."]}, {"page": "David Brown", "response": ["* David Brown (British artist) (), British painter", "* David Brown (American artist), American visual artist based in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, active since 2004", "* David Brown (producer) (1916\u20132010), American movie producer", "* David Brown (radio host), American lawyer, radio personality and journalist", "* David Brown (1734\u20131804), Scottish-Danish merchant and shipowner", "* David Brown (entrepreneur) (1904\u20131993), British entrepreneur (David Brown & Sons, Aston Martin, Vosper Thorneycroft)", "* David Brown (American musician) (1947\u20132000), American musician, bass player with Santana, 1966\u20131976", "* David Brown (Australian musician) (born 1956), Australian musician, active since 1978", "* David Brown (singer), American Idol contestant in 2005", "* David Brown, vocalist with Canadian band The New Cities", "* David Brown (British musician) (born 1987), better known as Boyinaband, YouTube personality and musician", "* David Brown, American guitarist, Billy Joel, Simon & Garfunkel, Phoebe Snow", "* David Brown, American bass guitarist, Boz Scaggs", "* David Brown, mayor of Charlottesville, Virginia in 2004\u20132008", "* David Brown (Massachusetts protester) (1740\u20131812), convicted of sedition because of his criticism of the United States federal government", "* David Brown (police officer) (born 1960), Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department since April 2, 2020", "* David Brown (East India Company chaplain) (1762\u20131812), English chaplain in Bengal", "* David Brown (Free Church of Scotland) (1803\u20131897), Scottish professor of theology at the University of Aberdeen", "* David Brown (bishop) (David Allan Brown, 1922\u20131982), Bishop of Guildford 1973\u20131982", "* David Brown (theologian) (David William Brown, born 1948), Scottish professor of theology, aesthetics, and culture, University of St. Andrews", "* David Brown (meteorologist) (born 1959), Australian meteorologist", "* David Brown (geneticist) (born 1968), American geneticist", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1887) (1887\u20131970), Scottish striker for numerous clubs", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u2013?), Scottish footballer who played for Tottenham Hotspur and Greenock Morton", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1963), defender for Tranmere Rovers", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1978), striker who plays for Wrexham Football Club", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1989), striker who plays for Bradford Park Avenue", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1946), Australian rules footballer for Geelong", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1967), Australian rules footballer for Sydney Swans", "* David Brown (footballer, born 1969), Australian rules footballer for Adelaide and Port Adelaide", "* David Brown (Scottish cricketer) (1941\u20132011), Scottish cricketer", "* David Brown (ice hockey) (born 1985), Canadian ice hockey goaltender from Ontario", "* David Brown (golfer) (1861\u20131936), Scottish golfer", "* David Brown (rower, born 1928) (1928\u20132004), American rower and Olympic gold medalist", "* David Brown (ski jumper) (born 1965), Canadian ski jumper", "* David Brown (parathlete) (born 1992), American Paralympic champion", "* David Brown (musicologist) (1929\u20132014), English musicologist, Tchaikovsky specialist", "* David Brown (pharmacology professor), English professor of pharmacology", "* David Brown (Royal Navy officer) (1927\u20132005), British admiral", "* David Brown (Scottish Jew), the first Jew known to have lived in Edinburgh in 1691", "* David Brown (translator) (c. 1806\u20131829), Cherokee translator and clergyman", "* David Brown (Emmerdale), a fictional character in the British soap opera Emmerdale", "* David Brown Automotive (founded 2013), a British manufacturer of limited edition automobiles", "** David Brown Mini Remastered (2017\u2013present), a city car produced by the British car manufacturer", "** David Brown Speedback (2014\u2013present), a grand tourer produced by the British car manufacturer", "* David Brown Ltd.

Other scholars, including Michael Paul Smith, believe that with or without the supposed 'court of honour' sentence, there is no way that Tchaikovsky could have known the time of his own death while composing his last masterpiece. There is also evidence that Tchaikovsky was unlikely to have been depressed while composing the symphony, with his brother noting of him after he had sent the manuscript for publishing, \"I had not seen him so bright for a long time past.\"", "Tchaikovsky specialist David Brown suggests that the symphony deals with the power of Fate in life and death. This program would not only be similar to those suggested for the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, but also parallels a program suggested by Tchaikovsky for his unfinished Symphony in E. That program reads, \"The ultimate essence ... of the symphony is Life.  First part \u2013 all impulse, passion, confidence, thirst for activity.  Must be short (the finale death \u2013 result of collapse).  Second part love: third disappointments; fourth ends dying away (also short).\""]}, {"page": "Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)", "response": ["All this is in line with the earlier analysis of the Concerto published by Tchaikovsky authority David Brown, who further suggests that Alexander Borodin's First Symphony may have given the composer both the idea to write such an introduction and to link the work motivically as he does. Brown also identifies a four-note musical phrase ciphered from Tchaikovsky's own name and a three-note phrase likewise taken from the name of soprano D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Art\u00f4t, to whom the composer had been engaged some years before.Brown, Crisis Years, 22\u201324."]}, {"page": "Manfred Symphony", "response": ["Nevertheless, musicologist David Brown considered the finale the weakest part of Manfred, not because of the music itself but of the programme. Up to this point, Brown writes, Tchaikovsky had very successfully reconciled extramusical specifications with musical structure. Now the program takes over, resulting in a fragmented movement with musical disruption and non sequiturs. The fatal flaw is the fugue, which Tchaikovsky wrote to convey the reaction of the hordes of the evil spirit Arimanes to Manfred's appearance amongst them. A fugue, Brown argues, is by nature undramatic in both its fixation on one thematic idea and its measured progress; therefore, it cannot help but sound stodgy, resulting in a misstep from which the music never fully recovers.Brown, Man and Music, 297\u2013298. Musicologist Ralph Wood, in contrast, stated that while the finale may have its faults, there is still much about the music that is quite good.Wood, 92\u201393."]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)", "response": ["Its first performance in the United Kingdom was at the Crystal Palace in 1899, conducted by Sir August Manns, who seems to have been the first to refer to it as the \"Polish Symphony\", in reference to the recurring Polish dance rhythms prominent in the symphony's final movement. Several musicologists, including David Brown and Francis Maes, consider this name a faux pas. Western listeners, conditioned by Chopin's use of the polonaise as a symbol of Polish independence, interpreted Tchaikovsky's use of the same dance likewise; actually, in Tsarist Russia it was musical code for the Romanov dynasty and, by extension, Russian imperialism.", "Like Robert Schumann's Rhenish Symphony, the Third Symphony has five movements instead of the customary four in a suite-like formal layout, with a central slow movement flanked on either side by a scherzo.Keller, 344. The work also shares the Rhenish's overall tone of exuberant optimism. For these reasons, musicologist David Brown postulates that Tchaikovsky might have conceived the Third Symphony with the notion of what Schumann might have written had he been Russian.Brown, Crisis, 44; Maes, 78.Tchaikovsky was not the only Russian composer to use Schumann in general, or the Rhenish in particular, as a model. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov acknowledged it as a reference when, as a naval cadet, he wrote his First Symphony; the work itself is closely patterned after Schumann's Fourth. The Rhenish, in fact, was one of two works that had most impressed Tchaikovsky during his student days at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory; the other was the Ocean Symphony by his teacher, Anton Rubinstein.Brown, Early, 63\u20134.", "In his biography and analysis of Tchaikovsky's music, Roland John Wiley likens the five-movement format to a divertimento and questions whether Tchaikovsky wanted to allude in this work to the 18th century.Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 133. Rosa Newmarch mentions the 3rd Symphony in D is a work altogether different in style to his two earlier ones, and totally western in character. Such a move would not be unique or unprecedented in Tchaikovsky's work; David Brown points out in the 1980 edition of the New Grove that the composer occasionally wrote in a form of Mozartian pastiche throughout his career.Brown, New Grove (1980), 18:628.  (The Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello and orchestra, which Wiley suggests by Tchaikovsky's use of the word Rococo in the title is his \"first nominal gesture toward 18th century music,\" is in fact a near-contemporary of the symphony.)Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 143.

However, though surviving Tchaikovsky letters include details of this planned opera, its plot and characters, he finally abandoned this plan and chose instead for an opera with a Russian background.David Brown, \"Tchaikovsky: A Biographical and Critical Study\", Victor Gollancz, London, 1992, Vol. 1, Ch. 5, P. 136"]}, {"page": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and The Five", "response": ["What endeared the Little Russian to the kuchka was not simply that Tchaikovsky had used Ukrainian folk songs as melodic material.

This was a goal toward which the kuchka strived, both collectively and individually. Tchaikovsky, with his Conservatory grounding, could sustain such development longer and more cohesively than his colleagues in the kuchka. (Though the comparison may seem unfair, Tchaikovsky authority David Brown has pointed out that, because of their similar time-frames, the finale of the Little Russian shows what Mussorgsky could have done with \"The Great Gate of Kiev\" from Pictures at an Exhibition had he possessed academic training comparable to that of Tchaikovsky.)Brown, Early Years, 265\u2013269."]}, {"page": "Symphonies by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky", "response": ["Ideally, Tchaikovsky's training at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory would have thoroughly equipped him to work with European principles and forms of organizing musical material,Brown, Final, 426. just as immersion in those things might have helped him gain a sense of belonging to world culture.Volkov, 111.

The flute solo that starts the movement may also be a reference to her.Classical Music on the Web The second subject of the first movement starts with the notes D flat\u2013A (in German Des\u2013A), which the musicologist David Brown argues is a musical cipher on Art\u00f4t's name, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Art\u00f4t. The use of initials spelled out in musical pitches is a device often used by Robert Schumann (for example, in his Carnaval), and Tchaikovsky was a great admirer of Schumann's music.Steven Ledbetter, notes for Colorado Symphony Orchestra  The sequence D flat\u2013A is naturally resolved by a B flat, which, according to Brown, determined the overall key of the entire concerto, B flat minor, a very unusual key for a concerto or symphony.David Brown, Tchaikovsky, pp. 96-98 The famous opening theme of the first movement is written in the relative major key, D flat major (Des), and after being played twice, it never reappears (perhaps an echo of Art\u00f4t's sudden disappearance from his life). The theme is introduced by a descending minor key gesture (F\u2013D flat\u2013C\u2013B flat) on the horns, which might be a reference to Art\u00f4t's father, a professor of horn, but is more likely a reference to the composer himself: he used the sequence E\u2013C\u2013B\u2013A as his own signature in other works,Music Theory Online"]}, {"page": "Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky", "response": ["\"Tchaikovsky was made for ballet,\" writes musicologist David BrownBrown, Final, 212.

Brown explains that Tchaikovsky's gift for melody and orchestration, his ability to write memorable dance music with great fluency and his responsiveness to a theatrical atmosphere made him uniquely qualified in writing for the genre.Brown, New Grove (1980), 18:614. Above all, Brown writes, he had \"an ability to create and sustain atmosphere: above all, a faculty for suggesting and supporting movement ... animated by an abundant inventiveness, above all rhythmic, within the individual phrase.\"Brown, Crisis, 78. In comparing Tchaikovsky to French composer L\u00e9o Delibes, whose ballets Tchaikovsky adored, Brown writes that while the two composers shared similar talents, the Russian's passion places him in a higher league than that of the Frenchman. Where Delibes' music remains decorative, Tchaikovsky's touches the senses and achieves a deeper significance.Brown, Final', 212\u20133.

He decided to present the young composer a copy of the score of his Manfred Symphony, and once he had actually met the person whom Tchaikovsky authority David Brown called \"indolent, fastidious, very private yet very engaging\", his attitude toward Lyadov took a sharp turn for the better. The younger composer became known as \"dear Lyadov\".", "The triumph of the Belyayev circle could be seen as the worst of both worlds from The Five and Tchaikovsky for two reasons. First, from Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, the Belyayevets realized the importance of a solid academic grounding, but they took the importance of their conservatory training to extremes, and devolved into academicism and epigonism. They failed to take into account that Tchaikovsky transcended what authority David Brown calls \"the heavy conditioning of his conservatory training\" through his \"innate Russianness and his love of his own country's folk music\",Brown, New Grove (1980), 18:628. and that Rimsky-Korsakov similarly transcended a period of extremely pedantic music writing to arrive at a more balanced style.Brown, Crisis Years, 229. Second, the Belyayevets got the idea from The Five of a school to which all members would adhere, but they took adherence to their school to the point of mediocrity, with \"a safe conformism\" becoming \"increasingly the rule\".Taruskin, 57.
