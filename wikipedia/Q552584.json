Subsequently, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, wanted, now that he was premier, to disassociate himself from the controversial John Wilson Croker, who was a founding member of the Athenaeum Club; a close associate of the pre-eminent neoclassical architects James Burton and Decimus Burton; an advocate of neoclassicism; and a repudiator of the neo-gothic style. Consequently, Peel appointed a committee chaired by Edward Cust, a detestor of the style of John Nash and William Wilkins, which resolved that the new Houses of Parliament would have to be in either the 'gothic' or the 'Elizabethan' style. Augustus W. N. Pugin, the foremost expert on the Gothic, had to submit each of his designs through, and thus in the name of, other architects, Gillespie-Graham and Charles Barry, because he had recently openly and fervently converted to Roman Catholicism, as a consequence of which any design submitted in his own name would certainly have been automatically rejected; the design he submitted for improvements to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1843 were rejected for this reason. The design for Parliament that Pugin submitted through Barry won the competition. Subsequent to the announcement of the design ascribed to Barry, William Richard Hamilton, who had been secretary to Elgin during the acquisition of the marbles, published a pamphlet in which he censured the fact that 'gothic barbarism' had been preferred to the masterful designs of Ancient Greece and Rome: but the judgement was not altered, and was ratified by the Commons and the Lords. The commissioners subsequently appointed Pugin to assist in the construction of the interior of the new Palace, to the design of which Pugin himself had been the foremost determiner. Pugin's biographer, Rosemary Hill, shows that Barry designed the Palace as a whole, and only he could co-ordinate such a large project and deal with its difficult paymasters, but he relied entirely on Pugin for its Gothic interiors, wallpapers and furnishings.Hill, 2007, pp. 316\u2013318 The first stone of the new Pugin-Barry design was laid on 27 April 1840."]}, {"page": "Robert Adam", "response": ["File:Harewood Castle 01.jpg|Harewood House, Yorkshire, altered by Sir Charles Barry"]}, {"page": "Todmorden", "response": ["Todmorden has the look of a Victorian mill town.

In 1836 a competition for designs for a new palace was won by Charles Barry.  Barry's plans, developed in collaboration with Augustus Pugin, incorporated the surviving buildings into the new complex. The competition established Gothic Revival as the predominant national architectural style and the palace has since been categorised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, of outstanding universal value.", "There were 97\u00a0entries to the competition, which closed in November 1835; each entry was to be identifiable only by a pseudonym or symbol.

Uninspired by any English secular Elizabethan or Gothic buildings, Barry had visited Belgium to view examples of Flemish civic architecture before he drafted his design; to complete the necessary pen and ink drawings, which are now lost, he employed Augustus Pugin, a 23-year-old architect who was, in the words of the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, \"the most fertile and passionate of the Gothicists\".

Cliveden has been spelled differently over the centuries, some of the variations being Cliffden, Clifden, Cliefden and Clyveden.  The  gardens and woodlands are open to the public, together with parts of the house on certain days. There have been three houses on this site: the first, built in 1666, burned down in 1795 and the second house (1824) was also destroyed by fire, in 1849. The present Grade I listed house was built in 1851 by the architect Charles Barry for the 2nd Duke of Sutherland.", "Designed by Charles Barry in 1851 to replace a house previously destroyed by fire, the present house is a blend of the English Palladian style and the Roman Cinquecento.Crathorne 1995, p. 29 The Victorian three-storey mansion sits on a  long,  high brick terrace or viewing platform (visible only from the south side) which dates from the mid-17th century.

Barry, whose most famous project is arguably the Houses of Parliament, Westminster, was inspired by the outline of the two earlier houses for his design. The third (and present) house on the site was completed in 1851\u201352, and its exterior appearance has little changed since then. The -tall clock tower, which is actually a water tower (still working to this day) was added in 1861 by the architect Henry Clutton.

This part of the garden has received the most attention over the centuries. The first arranging of the large plateau to the south of the house took place c.1723 during George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney's ownership.NT Guide 1994, pp. 48\u201349 Although he had previously commissioned plans for elaborate parterre schemes from Claude Desgots, the nephew of Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre (both designers had previously worked at Versailles), Orkney eventually chose a much simpler plan involving an open expanse of lawn surrounded by raised gravel walks and double rows of elm trees.NT Guide 2012, p. 16  At the far end there was (and still is) a sunken feature in the turf where Orkney's horses were exercised in a form of open-air man\u00e8ge.NT Guide 1994. p. 69 Orkney referred to the garden as his \"Quaker parterre\" because of its simplicity. The parterre endured in this form until the mid 19th-century when the estate was owned by the Duke of Sutherland and by which time the garden had been neglected. It was described by the Duke's son Lord Ronald Gower as \"a prairie...a huge field of grass and wild flowers.\"Crathorne 1995, p. 99 The Duke commissioned both Charles Barry (who had rebuilt the mansion after the second fire) and John Fleming (the head gardener) to produce designs for a complex parterre of flower beds. Fleming's design, which featured two sets of eight interlocking wedge-shaped beds, was chosen and is the template for what can be seen today. The beds were planted with a seasonal mix of bulbs, annuals and shrubs such as gladioli, hollyhocks, tulips, pansies and azaleas. Fleming pioneered this style of planting at Cliveden, which was later to be named \"carpet-bedding.\" The Cliveden scheme in the 19th-century is well documented in Fleming's handbook Winter and Spring Flower Gardening (1864). The Trust planted the present clipped yew pyramids at the corners of the beds in 1976.NT Guide 1994, p. 69 At this time (and for the next three decades) the beds contained a massed-planting effect of silver-evergreen Senecio \"Sunshine\" and Santolina, but in 2010 the Trust decided to recreate Fleming's original 19th-century planting scheme.", "Category:Charles Barry buildings"]}, {"page": "John Soane", "response": ["Soane designed several public buildings in London, including: National Debt Redemption OfficeStroud, 1984, p. 207 (1817) demolished 1900; Insolvent Debtors CourtStroud, 1984, p. 219 (1823) demolished 1861; Privy Council and Board of Trade Offices, WhitehallStroud, 1984, p. 226 (1823\u201324), remodelled by Sir Charles Barry, the building now houses the Cabinet Office; in a new departure for Soane he used the Italianate style for The New State Paper Office,Stroud, 1984, p. 235 (1829\u201330) demolished 1868 to make way for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office building."]}, {"page": "Birmingham Town Hall", "response": ["Two sites were considered by the Birmingham Street Commissioners for the construction of a concert hall in the city; Bennetts Hill and the more expensive Paradise Street site.
