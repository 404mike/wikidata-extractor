The work was commissioned by BBC Radio 3 for The Proms.

Retrieved August 19, 2016.", "The piece was praised by Martin Kettle of The Guardian, who wrote, \"The concerto confronts two important, linked questions with which many creative artists have wrestled: how can a composer respond to the great public issues of the day \u2013 in this case the war in Syria \u2013 and how can any such response avoid being judged on moral as much as on musical grounds? Bray's concerto sensibly embodies these questions rather than answering them.\"  Steph Power of The Independent similarly observed, \"Propelled by outrage at the atrocities visited upon Syria by Isis, Bray has responded with music that is defiantly exquisite as well as stark, for example, with the high-ringing tinnitus that follows a bomb explosion. Surging with energy, her colouristic writing was acutely felt by both the orchestra and brilliant soloist Guy Johnston.\"", "Barry Millington of the London Evening Standard remarked, \"Passages of repetitive jagged material, perhaps alluding to the firing of arms, alternate with poignant interludes that suggest altered states of consciousness.\"  He nevertheless added, \"The cello soloist (Guy Johnston) meditates on the situation, but is not always clearly audible. One senses that the original commission of a cello concerto proved incompatible with the conception as it took shape. The work has some original, inspired touches, but it's a brave composer that attempts a piece of such attenuated introspection in a big space like the Albert Hall.\""]}, {"page": "Sheku Kanneh-Mason", "response": ["Sheku appears as a guest artist on the album Tecchler\u2019s Cello: from Cambridge to Rome by cellist and fellow BBC Young Musician winner Guy Johnston, released in September 2017."]}, {"page": "A Span of Time", "response": ["The recordings feature cellists Julian Lloyd Webber and his wife Jiaxin Cheng, the English Chamber Orchestra, the European Union Chamber Orchestra, as well as pianist John Lenehan, harpist Catrin Finch and two former BBC Young Musician of the Year winners Guy Johnston and Laura van der Heijden.", "* Guy Johnston cello"]}]}}
