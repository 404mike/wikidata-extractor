The following season Morley scored only five goals from 32 appearances. Morley was stabbed by his wife in March 1991, missing eight league games from March until 10 April 1991. Manager Billy Bonds, in a difficult season, often used Mike Small and Clive Allen as the main strikers as West Ham finished bottom of the First Division.

He was again top scorer with 22 goals from 49 appearances with West Ham again gaining promotion, this time to the Premier League as runners-up to Newcastle United. This season saw Morley's only sending-off as a West Ham player. In the Anglo-Italian Cup in a home game to Reggiana having received some rough treatment by Gianluca Francesconi, Morley struck out at the player and was sent off. His suspension only applied to games in the Anglo-Italian Cup. With West Ham now back in the top tier of English football Morley scored his first Premier League goal on 18 August 1993 in a 2\u20130 away win at Blackburn Rovers, a game which saw the debuts of Lee Chapman and David Burrows and Mike Marsh who had joined following the departure of Julian Dicks to Liverpool.

Former player Ronnie Boyce stood in as manager for a single game. The next manager was Billy Bonds, a popular choice who took-up the post on 23 February 1990. It was too late for Bonds to turn the season around, however, and they finished seventh. In the following season, with Trevor Morley scoring 17 goals and McAvennie 11, Bonds guided West Ham to second place and promotion to the First Division and an FA Cup semi-final place before being beaten in controversial circumstances by Nottingham Forest. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. New players Mike Small and Clive Allen were unable to provide the goals and the team finished bottom with only nine wins, only three after the turn of the new year. With the club now back in the second tier, Bonds appointed Harry Redknapp as his assistant at the start of the season. Bond's West Ham finished second and again gained promotion, this time to the FA Premier League. With Morley and Allen scoring 40 goals, they gained promotion on the last day of the season with a 2\u20130 home win against Cambridge United. With the team in the FA Premier League there was a need to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was recruited for a fee of \u00a31.2\u00a0million. Shortly after arriving at the club, he complained that he should not have made the move as it was too far from his Oxford home. Bonds found this attitude hard to understand compared with his own committed, never-say-die style. This was the first evidence of his losing appetite for the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon for a club-record combined fee of \u00a3800,000, which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction; Whitbread was valued at \u00a3750,000 in the deal.Coventry ask Babb bidders to raise offers Liverpool made to wait Assistant manager Harry Redknapp was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club, AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position  the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie made a controversial move. Anxious not to lose Redknapp's services the West Ham board offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club, on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club. His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, \"If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation.
