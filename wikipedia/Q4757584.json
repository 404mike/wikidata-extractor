Nick took over from Tate as Station Officer in Series 4. He got his nickname due to his Greek-Cypriot origins. Nick was a disciplinarian, and was not impressed by some of Blue Watch's lax ways upon his arrival. However, he proved to be very caring and compassionate as he settled into the station, and like Tate, became something of a father figure to the members of the Watch. Nick's traditionalist family tried to arrange a marriage for him, but he resisted. He had an affair with his married cousin Ariadne. She died from injuries she incurred in a fall but their unborn son survived. Distraught, Nick initially struggled to cope with her death and his new son. He later met Dutch firefighter, Marianne, when she was at a demonstration show in the UK, and after a stop-start romance they eventually moved in together. Nick was promoted to ADO in Series 11, but had some trouble adjusting to the role and was never convinced that Chris Hammond was the right station officer for Blue Watch, especially after he found out that Hammond was being hounded by gangsters for an unpaid debt. Before he could take the matter up with DO Chapman, Nick was killed at a cinema fire when a ceiling collapsed on him."]}, {"page": "Widows (TV series)", "response": ["* Andrew Kazamia as Micky Tesco"]}, {"page": "Quadriga Productions", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Kazamia"]}, {"page": "Wilson's School", "response": ["* Andrew Kazamia, actor with a regular role in London's Burning, playwright and film-makerAndrew Kazamia"]}, {"page": "Trust Me (2007 film)", "response": ["Trust Me is a 2007 film written and directed by Andrew Kazamia.", "The film was produced by Quadriga Productions and stars  Enn Reitel, Tony Curran, Craig Ferguson, and Shelley Long.
