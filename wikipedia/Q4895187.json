They worked together over the next twenty years on some 3000 songs and monologues, 75 stage shows and musicals, and 17 films, as well as for pantomimes and radio shows.    They immediately found success together with \"Lloyd George's Beer Song\" (1915), \"Good-bye-ee!\" (1917, made popular by Florrie Forde), and \"Paddy McGinty's Goat\", which later received a new lease of life as part of the repertoire of Irish entertainer Val Doonican, who recorded it in 1964.   From the start, their collaborations were conducted in Weston's house in Twickenham.  They kept office hours, met every day and aimed to write at least one song each day.
