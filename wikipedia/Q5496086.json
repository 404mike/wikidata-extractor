He also qualified as a structural engineer and arbitrator.\nHe married Hilda in 1944 and had three daughters and lived in Whiteleaf, outside Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.\nHe was a supporter of mid-ranking architects, and ensured that project/job architects' names were put on all Buckinghamshire County Council buildings, not just the county architect, and promoted this idea to the wider profession. He was noted for his strong support of public transport, firstly with his monorail proposals for the new city that became Milton Keynes, and his later role in London where he identified the growing problem of the car and its impact on the city.", "link_mentions": {}}}
