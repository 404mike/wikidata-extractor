He was noted for his strong support of public transport, firstly with his monorail proposals for the new city that became Milton Keynes, and his later role in London where he identified the growing problem of the car and its impact on the city.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Buckinghamshire", "response": ["In 1966, the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect Fred Pooley.
