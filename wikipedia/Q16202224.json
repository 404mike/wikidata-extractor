Her painting The Castaway (Royal Academy, 1855) was unusual in showing a woman who has sunk into prostitution. In 1856 she helped Leigh Smith to collect signatures for a petition that would lead to the Married Women's Property Act 1870.The text of the petition appears here: Retrieved 9 July 2011.  Family accounts record her distress over criticism from John Ruskin of her ambitious painting of Boadicea, which was also rejected by the Royal Academy.
