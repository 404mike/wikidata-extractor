This Amendment said: This House \"believes that the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established, especially given the absence of specific United Nations authorisation; but, in the event that hostilities do commence, pledges its total support for the British forces\". However, just 45 minutes later he backed the Government on the main vote authorising \"all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction\", in effect supporting the 2003 Iraq war. He later referred to these events in his September 2013 newsletter published online, in which claimed that he was \"one of the 'rebels' who voted against the Iraq War in 2003.\" During the campaign for the 2015 general election, he participated in a hustings meeting in the Drumchapel district of his Glasgow North West constituency. In response to a question from a member of the public, he repeatedly denied that he had voted for the Iraq War. The SNP candidate, Carol Monaghan, again asserted that Robertson had voted for the Iraq War, to which he responded \"not true\". These denials led to heated arguments with members of the public who accused him of being a liar. Robertson was defeated by Monaghan at the subsequent election."]}, {"page": "Glasgow North West (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Carol Monaghan"]}, {"page": "Scottish Westminster constituencies from 2005", "response": ["| Carol Monaghan"]}, {"page": "Blairdardie", "response": ["The area is within Drumchapel/Anniesland Ward (Ward 14) of Glasgow City Council and is represented by Cllr Judith Fisher, Cllr Paul Carey, Cllr Malcolm Balfour and Bailie Jonathan Findlay.

Carol Monaghan said she would challenge four cases of patients with multiple sclerosis being called for reassessment despite their illness worsening. \u201cMS is a progressive condition. They\u2019re never going to be any better than they are at the moment, so they should never be asked to go for a reassessment.  Some of these people are still able to walk to a certain extent, so they get themselves in, just about, and then they\u2019re being told, \u2018You look fine,\u2019\u201d she said.  Phil Reynolds of Parkinson's UK said about a quarter of British people with Parkinson\u2019s lost some or all their benefit after reassessments, but got payments reinstated after appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crucial that the DWP looks again at the broken PIP assessment to ensure people with long-term conditions get the support they so desperately need, rather than rigging the system against them,\u201d he said.  Almost half multiple sclerosis patients claiming PIP must be reassessed inside two years, the MS Society claims. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the number of people with MS being inappropriately reassessed, especially when we know assessments can cause stress and anxiety, and in some cases exacerbate MS symptoms.  With more than 100,000 people living with MS in the UK, the PIP system needs to accurately reflect the realities of living with a fluctuating and progressive condition. Having a disability like MS is hard enough. People should be able to rely on support without fear of having it taken away,\u201d said Laura Wetherly of the MS Society.
