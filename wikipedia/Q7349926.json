Church-History was printed with The History of the University of Cambridge since the Conquest and The History of Waltham Abbey. These works were furthered by his connection with Sion College, London, where he had a room. The Church History was angrily attacked from the high-church side by Peter Heylin. At the Oxford Act of 1657, Robert South, who was Terrae filius, lampooned Fuller, whom he described in this Oratio as living in London, ever scribbling and each year bringing forth new folia like a tree. At length, continues South, the Church-History came forth with its 166 dedications to wealthy and noble friends; and with this huge volume under one arm, and his wife (said to be little of stature) on the other, he ran up and down the streets of London, seeking at the houses of his patrons invitations to dinner, to be repaid by his dull jests at table. His last and best patron was George Berkeley, 1st Earl Berkeley (1628\u20131698), of Cranford House, Middlesex, whose chaplain he was, and who gave him Cranford rectory (1658). Fuller afterwards dedicated The Appeal of Injured Innocence (1659), his reply to Heylyn's Examen Historicum, to Berkeley. In An Alarum to the Counties of England and Wales (1660) Fuller argued for a free and full parliament\u2014free from force, as he expressed it, as well as from abjurations or previous engagements.

He continued in a role of spokesman for his type of limited sceptical approach, and the Society's production of useful knowledge.Richard H. Popkin (editor), The Pimlico History of Western Philosophy (1999), pp. 360\u20132. As part of his programme, he argued for a plain use of language, undistorted as to definitions and reliance on metaphor.Jonathan Sawday, The Body Emblazoned: Dissection and the Human Body in Renaissance Culture (1996), p. 235. He also advocated with Essay Concerning Preaching (1678) simple speech, rather than bluntness, in preaching, as Robert South did, with hits at nonconformist sermons; he was quite aware that the term \"plain\" takes a great deal of unpacking.N.

In particular, very many verses of the Psalms are split into two halves, each of which says much the same thing in different words. The complex rules and forms of written language as distinct from spoken language were not as well-developed as they are today when the books making up the Old Testament were written.Ong, Walter J., Orality and Literacy (New Accents), p. 38, McWhorter, John C.

Also in that year, Curll was sent to jail for publishing an account of the trial of the Earl of Winton.  No sooner was he out than he produced a biography of Dr. Robert South, former head of Westminster School.  He had printed the eulogy for Dr. South by the current school head, as well.  He was invited to the school and expected to be honored for the work he had done on behalf of the memory of the school's masters.  Instead, the students forced him to his knees by beatings and forced him to beg for an apology.  They then wrapped him in a blanket and began beating him with sticks and tossing him in the air.  Samuel Wesley, a student at the school and older brother to John Wesley, wrote a mock-heroic poem on the blanket incident.  Curll suspected that Pope and his friends were somehow responsible for his treatment, and he began to employ the \"phantom poet.\"  He published a poem called \"The Petticoat\" by \"J. Gay.\"  This poet was Francis Chute, who used the pseudonym \"Joseph Gay.\"  To siphon off sales of John Gay's poems and to wound Pope and his friends, Curll used this phantom twice more."]}, {"page": "Richard Busby", "response": ["Richard Busby (; 22 September 1606 \u2013 6 April 1695) was an English Anglican priest who served as head master of Westminster School for more than fifty-five years.
