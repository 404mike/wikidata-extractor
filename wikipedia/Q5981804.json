From 1971 through 1973 he became the first to cycle from Cape Horn to Alaska. Hibell co-authored a book entitled Into the Remote Places (with Clinton Trowbridge) \ndocumenting his travels. \nHe lectured on his travels in Great Britain and the United States, including at Yale University.  He also designed some of his own gear, including front and rear luggage racks.Ian Hibell began cycle-touring when not all his family could afford to travel to a seaside holiday by train. He and his father cycled there, sleeping on park benches and anywhere else they could find. He worked at Standard Telephones and Cables and took leave to go cycling, eventually riding more than he was working. He went on to ride the equivalent of ten times round the equator, covering 6,000 miles a year. He is recognised as first to cycle the Dari\u00e9n Gap in Panama and from south to north of the Americas.\nHe also rode from Norway to the Cape of Good Hope and from Bangkok to Vladivostok.A van drove over his arm and hand in China in 2006. He came close to losing his life after losing his bicycle while riding across the Sahara. He recounted how he was saved by wandering Arabs, who could see his bicycle even though he couldn't, and that all he had with which to reward them was a tube of sun cream, \"which I didn't think they would particularly need.\"\nHis favourite bike had a Freddie Grubb frame of Reynolds 531 tubing, reinforced for extra weight. In his book, \"Into the Remote Places\" (1984), he called his bike a companion, crutch and friend. \"The quiet hum of the wheels, the creak of strap against load, the clink of something in the pannier\", was \"delicious\". \nHibell was killed on 23 August 2008 in Greece by a hit and run driver on the  Athens-Salonika highway near Nea Erithrea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bicycle touring", "response": ["* Ian Hibell"]}, {"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["| align=\"left\"| Ian Hibell"]}, {"page": "Dari\u00e9n Gap", "response": ["The first fully overland wheeled crossing (others used boats for some sections) of the Gap was that of British cyclist Ian Hibell, who rode from Cape Horn to Alaska between 1971 and 1973.

Hibell completed his crossing of the Gap accompanied by two New Zealand cycling companions who had ridden with him from Cape Horn, but neither of these continued with Hibell to Alaska.Hibell's \"Cape Horn to Alaska\" expedition forms part of his 1984 book Into the Remote Places."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2008", "response": ["*Ian Hibell, 74, British cyclist, hit and run car crash."]}]}}
