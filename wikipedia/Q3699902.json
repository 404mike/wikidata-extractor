During this time, he edited Oxford Outlook with Gerald Howard and A. B. B. Valentine, publishing work by L. A. G. Strong, Edmund Blunden, John Strachey, and Maurice Bowra. His own essays, short stories, and reviews were also included in its pages. In this early part of his career, Hartley spent most of his time broadening his social life. He was introduced by Huxley to Lady Ottoline Morrell, who welcomed him into her famed literary circle. Kitchin, with whom he had been reunited at Oxford, introduced him to Cynthia Asquith, who became a lifelong friend. He also met the writer and socialite Elizabeth Bibesco, whose support and status catapulted Hartley into aristocratic British circles. Although he enjoyed rapid social success, his career as a writer failed to take off, and he was unhappy.", "In 1924, he met Constant Huntington of G. P. Putnam, who published his  first volume of short stories, Night Fears, in that year, as well as his novella Simonetta Perkins in 1925. Night Fears was relatively unsuccessful, earning him no money. Simonetta Perkins brought him only \u00a312, though it was written about favourably. The Saturday Review called the young writer \"one of the most hopeful talents\", and The Calendar of Modern Letters said that Simonetta Perkins was a \"distinguished first novel\". Modern critics have called it his most dangerous novel, as Hartley explored infatuation and sexuality in a way not considered respectable at the time. In 1932, Hartley published The Killing Bottle, a collection of ghost stories. Cynthia Asquith included some of them in an anthology, which increased his popularity with the public. Critics thought of Hartley as the successor of the Gothic greats M. R. James and E. F. Benson.", "=== Conflicts with Virginia Woolf and Cynthia Asquith ===", "Cynthia Asquith was a support through much of Hartley's career, publishing some of his earliest writings in her anthologies and welcoming him into her social circles. However, feelings started to change after Hartley did not allow her to publish his novel The Go-Between. Asquith reminded him of this fact often, and Hartley came to believe that the only reason she continued to be friends with him was his increased popularity. At one point, Asquith convinced Hartley's cook to leave him and work for her. On another occasion, she gave him vinegar instead of alcohol.", "**\"From the Introduction to Lady Cynthia Asquith\u2019s Third Ghost Book\", \"A Visitor from Down Under\", \"Podolo\", \"Three, or Four, for Dinner\", \"The Travelling Grave\", \"Feet Foremost\", \"The Cotillon\", \"A Change of Ownership\", \"The Thought\", \"Conrad and the Dragon\", \"The Island\", \"Night Fears\", \"The Killing Bottle\", \"A Summons\", \"W.S.\", \"The Two Vaynes\", \"Monkshood Manor\", \"Two for the River\", \"Someone in the Lift\", \"The Face\", \"The Corner Cupboard\", \"The Waits\", \"The Pampas Clump\", \"The Crossways\", \"Per Far L'Amore\", \"Interference\", \"The Pylon\", \"Mrs Carteret Receives\", \"Fall in at the Double\", \"Paradise Paddock\", \"Roman Charity\", \"Pains and Pleasures\", \"Please Do Not Touch\", \"Home Sweet Home\", \"The Shadow on the Wall\", \"The Sound of Voices\", \"Mrs G.

Graham Greene stated in his Paris Review interview (Autumn 1953), \"I chose Marjorie Bowen [as a major influence] because as I have told you, I don't think that the books that one reads as an adult influence one as a writer...
