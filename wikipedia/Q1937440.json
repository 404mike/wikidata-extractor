He was educated at J.L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and in 1859 he entered the Government service of South Australia. He held various positions in the survey department, including Deputy Surveyor-General. He died of a heart attack on 12 August 1881, aged 38, after a long illness.\nAlthough Gosse's exploration was not groundbreaking, he filled in many details in the central map. He named the Musgrave Ranges and was able correctly to lay down the position of some of the discoveries of Ernest Giles. On 19 July 1873 he reached Uluru and gave it the name Ayers Rock. His second-in-charge, Edwin S. Berry (another AEI alumnus) was probably the first white man to climb \"The Rock\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1872", "response": ["* July 19 \u2013 Explorer William Gosse reached Uluru in central Australia and named it Ayers Rock."]}, {"page": "Ernest Giles", "response": ["Giles was the first European to see the rock formations named The Olgas, now officially known by  Kata Tjuta/Mount Olga, and Lake Amadeus.
