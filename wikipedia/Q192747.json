Bellamy's first goal of the season came in City's 4\u20132 win over Arsenal on 12 September 2009, before he set up Shaun Wright-Phillips for City's fourth goal with a run from his own half. A week later, he scored two goals against Manchester United in a 4\u20133 defeat. His first goal was a  strike from the edge of the  box which was later named Goal of the Month for September 2009. After the match, a fan invaded the pitch but was escorted from the field; Bellamy and the fan exchanged words, prompting the player to shove him in the face. Bellamy received no contact from the FA over the incident and Manchester City stated they would not discipline Bellamy, instead offering their support to him. After a run of seven consecutive draws in the Premier League, during the last of which Bellamy was sent off for two bookable offences, Hughes was sacked as manager and replaced by Roberto Mancini. The relationship between Bellamy and Mancini had a difficult start after a clash over training schedules. Mancini had introduced double sessions, which Bellamy struggled to undertake due to his long injury history. This escalated further when Bellamy missed two weeks after aggravating his knee during a clash with Manchester United supporters on a night out. After returning to training, the pair argued after Bellamy said he was unable to train for two consecutive days due to his personal fitness plan which angered Mancini. Despite this, Bellamy remained a regular in the first team for the rest of the season, finishing the campaign with 11 goals in 40 appearances."]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 FA Premier League", "response": ["Midfielders \u2013 Shaun Wright-Phillips, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Arjen Robben "]}, {"page": "Fabio Capello", "response": ["England's first match with Capello as manager was at Wembley Stadium against Switzerland on 6 February 2008.
