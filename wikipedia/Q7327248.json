For his contribution to the latter he was admitted to rank of Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.  \nEducated in music at University of York, Richard Langham Smith then pursued further study with Wilfrid Mellers and Debussy scholar Edward Lockspeiser as well as studying harpsichord and Baroque performance practice at the Amsterdam Conservatory. A university teaching career began at University of Lancaster, then City University, the University of Exeter, and finally the Open University where he was the Arnold Kettle Distinguished Scholar in Music and subsequently Head of Department. At this time he also was a visiting lecturer in Music at the University of Cambridge, teaching a course on French Opera from 1875 to the 21st Century. From September 2008 until July 2010 Smith was Head of the Graduate School at the Royal College of Music, London. In 2011 the RCM appointed him Research Professor in Music and in March 2016 Smith was awarded an FRCM. In addition to Academic teaching he is a lecturer for Martin Randall Travel, a regular broadcaster and lecturer for major concert venues and opera houses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Claude Debussy", "response": ["The application of the term \"Impressionist\" to Debussy and the music he influenced has been much debated, both during his lifetime and since. The analyst Richard Langham Smith writes that Impressionism was originally a term coined to describe a style of late 19th-century French painting, typically scenes suffused with reflected light in which the emphasis is on the overall impression rather than outline or clarity of detail, as in works by Monet, Pissarro, Renoir and others.Langham Smith, Richard. \"Impressionism\", The Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford University Press, 2011, retrieved 17 May 2018  Langham Smith writes that the term became transferred to the compositions of Debussy and others which were \"concerned with the representation of landscape or natural phenomena, particularly the water and light imagery dear to Impressionists, through subtle textures suffused with instrumental colour\"."]}, {"page": "Richard Smith", "response": ["* Richard Langham Smith (born 1947), British academic, head of music at the Open University"]}, {"page": "Ambroise Thomas", "response": ["Emmanuel Chabrier's jibe, \"There is good music, there is bad music, and then there is Ambroise Thomas\" is often quoted, but, as the musicologist Richard Langham Smith observes, it is not clear whether Chabrier meant that Thomas' music was worse than bad, somewhere between good and bad, or something else.Langham Smith Richard. \"Good, Bad and...\" , The Musical Times, Vol. 138, No. 1857 (November 1997), p. 32  A contemporary assessment was given in the first edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1889), where Gustave Chouquet wrote of Thomas:"]}, {"page": "Op\u00e9ra comique", "response": ["Op\u00e9ra comique (; plural: op\u00e9ras comiques) is a genre of French opera that contains spoken dialogue and arias. It emerged from the popular op\u00e9ras comiques en vaudevilles of the Fair Theatres of St Germain and St Laurent (and to a lesser extent the Com\u00e9die-Italienne),M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet and Richard Langham Smith. \"Op\u00e9ra comique\", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 19 November 2009 which combined existing popular tunes with spoken sections. Associated with the Paris theatre of the same name, op\u00e9ra comique is not necessarily comical or shallow in nature; Carmen, perhaps the most famous op\u00e9ra comique, is a tragedy.", "The term op\u00e9ra comique is complex in meaning and cannot simply be translated as \"comic opera\". The genre originated in the early 18th century with humorous and satirical plays performed at the theatres of the Paris fairs which contained songs (vaudevilles), with new words set to already existing music. The phrase op\u00e9ra comique en vaudevilles or similar was often applied to these early-stage works. In the middle of the 18th century, composers began to write original music to replace the vaudevilles, under the influence of the lighter types of Italian opera (especially Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's La serva padrona). This form of op\u00e9ra comique was often known as com\u00e9die m\u00eal\u00e9e d'ariettes, but the range of subject matter it covered expanded beyond the merely comic. By the 19th century, op\u00e9ra comique often meant little more than works with spoken dialogue performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique theatre, as opposed to works with recitative delivery which appeared at the Paris Op\u00e9ra. Thus, probably the most famous of all op\u00e9ras comiques, Georges Bizet's Carmen, is on a tragic subject. As Elizabeth Bartlet and Richard Langham Smith note in their Grove article on the subject, composers and librettists frequently rejected the use of the umbrella term op\u00e9ra comique in favor of more precise labels."]}, {"page": "List of compositions by Claude Debussy", "response": ["\"reconstituted\" from the mss in 1987 by Richard Langham Smith, orchestrated 1993 by Edison Denisov"]}, {"page": "Visiting Gresham Professor", "response": ["| 4 || Professor Richard Langham Smith || Music || 1 Sep 2003"]}, {"page": "Images pour orchestre", "response": ["Impressions of Spain inspired this music.
