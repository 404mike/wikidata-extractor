He was an early English enthusiast for 14th- and 15th-century Italian art, or the \"Italian Primitives\" as they were then often called.  He spent the 1790s based in Rome, where he bought much art; this was sold for a considerable profit in 1801 after his return to London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sandro Botticelli", "response": ["The English collector William Young Ottley bought Botticelli's The Mystical Nativity in Italy, bringing it to London in 1799.

On each is painted the names of the male line by which Jesus, through his earthly father, Joseph, is descended from Abraham, according to the Gospel of Matthew. However, the genealogy is now incomplete, since the two lunettes of the windows in the Altar wall were destroyed by Michelangelo when he returned to the Sistine Chapel in 1537 to paint The Last Judgement.Graham-Dixon 2008, p.\u00a0138. Only engravings, based on a drawing that has since been lost, remain of them.The destroyed lunettes: Abraham / Isaac / Jacob / Judah and Pharez / Hezron / Ram, engravings by William Young Ottley. The sequence of tablets seems a little erratic as one plaque has four names, most have three or two, and two plaques have only one. Moreover, the progression moves from one side of the building to the other, but not consistently, and the figures the lunettes contain do not coincide closely with the listed names. These figures vaguely suggest various family relationships; most lunettes contain one or more infants, and many depict a man and a woman, often sitting on opposing sides of the painted plaque that separates them. O'Malley describes them as \"simply representative figures, almost ciphers\"."]}, {"page": "Early Netherlandish painting", "response": ["During the early 19th century, the collection of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young Ottley, leading to the destruction of many manuscripts.
