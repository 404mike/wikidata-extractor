He then toured extensively in burlesque and other comedies and also appeared in London. In 1895, he toured in South Africa in a musical comedy, The Shop Girl. Beginning in 1896, he spent ten years creating roles in some of the era's most popular musical comedies for George Edwardes at Daly's Theatre. He continued playing in musicals in the West End and on Broadway until World War I, when he served in the British Army. After this, he continued to play in comedies, musical theatre and drama, also broadcasting frequently on the radio and appearing in several films later in his career.\nWright's daughter, Betty Huntley-Wright, had a successful television and film career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 7", "response": ["*  1868   \u2013 Huntley Wright, English actor (d. 1941)"]}, {"page": "July 10", "response": ["*  1941   \u2013 Huntley Wright, English actor (b. 1868)"]}, {"page": "The Cingalee", "response": ["The Cingalee is set in Ceylon and concerns colonial tea planters (one of the most popular songs in the score is called simply \"Tea, tea, tea\") in an era before this island paradise became the more troubled Sri Lanka.
