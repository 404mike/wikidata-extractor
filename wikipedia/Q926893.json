Some carved names can still be found in trees on the grounds from this period. The estate house was also used by American forces during World War II, and they installed a hot-water central-heating system for the main building.  The Forestry Commission bought the Hall and used it as a training school until the 1960s. By this time the house was poorly maintained and overgrown. In 1960, the house was leased to Peter Widdowson, who, with a partner from London, made some repairs to the house and grounds, operating it as an apartment building, hotel and public house.  Later, the Forestry Commission sold the house to John Haire, Baron Haire of Whiteabbey but kept the estate lands which now make up a large part of Thetford Forest."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 1966", "response": ["* John Haire, Baron Haire of Whiteabbey, British politician, MP (b. 1908)"]}]}}
