He also had a hand in assisting Firbeck in the invention of the Rotherham Plough. This was regarded as one of the key developments of the British Agricultural Revolution in the late 18th century. The invention was made around 1786, although some say he only improved on an earlier design by a Scottish farmer named Leckie.\nMichael Stirling is said to have invented a rotary threshing machine in 1758 which for forty years was used to process all the corn on his farm at Gateside, no published works have yet been found but his son William made a sworn statement to his minister to this fact, he also gave him the details of his father's death in 1796.Earlier (c.1772), he also invented windmill \"spring sails\", which replaced the simple canvas designs previously used with sails made from a series of shutters that could be operated by levers, allowing windmill sails to be quickly and safely controlled in the event of a storm.\nMeikle worked as a millwright at Houston Mill in East Linton, East Lothian, and inspired John Rennie to become a noted civil engineer.\nHe died at Houston Mill and is buried in East Linton's Prestonkirk Parish Church kirkyard, close to Rennie's father, George Rennie, who farmed the nearby Phantassie estate by the River Tyne.\nIn 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Andrew Meikle (1719\u20131811), mechanical engineer, inventor of the threshing machine"]}, {"page": "Industrial Revolution", "response": ["Joseph Foljambe's Rotherham plough of 1730 was the first commercially successful iron plough.

In this the loosened sheaves were fed, ears first, from a feeding board between two fluted revolving rollers to the beating cylinder. This cylinder or \"drum\" was armed with four iron-shod beaters or spars of wood parallel to its axle, and these striking the ears of corn as they protruded from the rollers knocked out the grain. The drum revolved at 200 to 250 revolutions per minute and carried the loose grain and straw on to a concave sieve beneath another revolving drum or rake with pegs which rubbed the straw on to the concave and caused the grain and chaff to fall through. Another revolving rake tossed the straw out of the machine. The straw thus passing under one peg drum and over the next was subjected to a thorough rubbing and tossing which separated the grain and chaff from it. These fell on to the floor beneath, ready for winnowing."]}, {"page": "Meikle", "response": ["*Andrew Meikle (1719\u20131811), Scottish mechanical engineer credited with inventing the threshing machine", "*Andrew Meikle Bryan FRSE (1893\u20131988), Scottish mining engineer"]}, {"page": "William Playfair", "response": ["Playfair was born in 1759 in Scotland.

Ploughs were steadily improved, from Joseph Foljambe's Rotherham iron plough in 1730 to James Small's improved \"Scots Plough\" metal in 1763. In 1789 Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies was producing 86 plough models for different soils.

The corn was fed in at the first floor level and rollers with grid-like brushes on separated the grain from the straw. The grain passed through the grid. The grain was bagged up for the millstones, the straw taken to the straw barn. A gathering or mill pond, leats and sluices were needed.Keys to the Past  Retrieved : 2012-06-22 The water supply came from the hill above and remains of the control sluice are still visible, with an overflow running through a pipe to the Montfode Burn and the 'spent' water from the mill leaving via a substantial stone lined outflow that exited below the main farm buildings.
