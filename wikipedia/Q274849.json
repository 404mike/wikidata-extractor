In its early days, there was a round of televised semi-finals, with the winner chosen by regional juries situated across the country. This format was used until 1960. During this era the show was known as the \"Festival of British Popular Songs\" (1957) and \"Eurovision Song Contest British Finals\" (1959 and 1960). In 1961 the show became known by its more familiar title, \"A Song For Europe\", with regional juries once more deciding the winner. Typically, during that period, singers would be invited by the BBC to choose and perform a song that they liked from the shortlist available. Household names such as Petula Clark, Lita Roza, Anne Shelton, Frank Ifield, Ronnie Hilton and David Hughes were amongst the contenders for the UK competition, none of whom were able to secure the much cherished ticket to the Eurovision final. In the early 1960s, record companies became involved in the selection process for the first time and submitted songs by their artists. This produced hits for Craig Douglas, Karl Denver, Jackie Lee, Kenny Lynch, Vince Hill and Ricky Valance, but again, none of them were selected to go forward to the Eurovision Song Contest final itself.", "* Lita Roza, Anne Shelton, Ronnie Hilton, Craig Douglas, Ricky Valance, Sandie Shaw, Cliff Richard, Mary Hopkin, The New Seekers/Lyn Paul, The Shadows, Frank Ifield, The Foundations, Sweet Sensation, Carl Wayne (of The Move), Alvin Stardust, Les McKeown (of Bay City Rollers), Sonia, Antony Costa (of Blue), Brian Harvey (of East 17), Liz McClarnon (of Atomic Kitten), Blue, Engelbert Humperdinck and Bonnie Tyler had all enjoyed a number one UK single prior to putting themselves forward for Eurovision."]}, {"page": "Hey There", "response": ["*Lita Roza (1955)"]}, {"page": "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?", "response": [" Mercury, however, had poor distribution in the United Kingdom. Therefore, a recording by Lita Roza was the one most widely heard in that country, reaching No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart in 1953.

Given the delay getting to market in the UK, it was not as successful as the Roza version, entering the charts at No. 9 on April 2, before leaving the charts altogether five weeks later. The Roza version reached No. 1 on April 23, where it stayed for a single week.

This made Lita Roza both the first female vocalist to top the UK singles chart and the first artist from Liverpool to do so, long before the success of The Beatles or Cilla Black in the 1960s. Roza held the top spot for one week, before gradually dropping down the top ten over the next five weeks, with its final week in the top ten being at No. 9 on May 23.", "Record sales in the UK were not a threat to the sheet music charts, broadcast on Radio Luxembourg, until around 1955. It is thought that the last sheet music million sellers were in 1953, and it has been suggested that \"(How Much is) That Doggie in the Window\" was the final title to reach this figure. The song entered the sheet music charts on February 28, 1953, and peaked at No. 1 on March 28, its fifth week on chart, staying there for six weeks in total. No recordings were commercially available until after the song had entered the sheet music charts, with several versions issued in March 1953: these were by Lita Roza, Patti Page, Carole Carr with Children's Choir and Rustler the Dog, and British actor John Slater. The following month, a version by the British child star Mandy Miller, who was aged just 8, was released. A parody version by American country music duo Homer and Jethro (titled \"That Hound Dog in the Window\") was released in November in the UK, after the song had left the charts. In May 1954, the UK branch of Mercury re-issued Page's recording.

In an interview in 2004 she revealed that she had kept her promise never to perform the song, \"I sang it once, just one take, and vowed I would never sing it again.
