Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities. The training ground was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with his own money, with the cleaning work being done in one weekend. Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high. Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at. In five-a-sides he and Terry McDermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players. Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: Lee Clark, Steve Watson, Steve Howey, Alan Thompson and Robbie Elliott. These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997. Keegan noted Steve Watson would take throw-ins via a somersault throw and this amused and shocked Keegan. Keegan regarded it as a gimmick and he could not believe the fans would take joy in it. The throw-in, to Keegan, was a sign of how far Newcastle had fallen. Keegan wanted the club to be known for scoring goals and thrilling football. Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark. Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off. Prior to the game Keegan arranged a training match for the reserves and included himself to make up the numbers. In the training match a frustrated Clark went through the back of Keegan in a knee high tackle, following a hospital pass, in a similar way that Romeo Benetti went into the back of Keegan in an England versus Italy match. The melee resulted in Pavel Srnicek swinging a roundhouse kick at Lee Clark's head. Keegan was not upset and he did not punish either player. To Keegan, Srnicek and Clark's response showed they cared about their football. Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3\u20130 victory in front of a capacity crowd."]}, {"page": "Northumbria University", "response": ["* Robbie Elliott, footballer and coach"]}, {"page": "Graeme Souness", "response": ["In the club's DVD season review for the 2005\u201306 season, goalkeeper Shay Given and defender Robbie Elliott acknowledged Souness was under pressure at the club as a result of injuries to the squad and admitted some players were to blame for their lack of all-round effort, but also admitted there was a bad atmosphere at the training ground, with Souness seeming to favour some players over others. Alan Shearer acknowledged the fans never really accepted Souness, as well as several injuries being instrumental in damaging the team's confidence.

Finally they faced Ipswich Town in the Divisional Play-Offs in May 2000. Both sides had drawn 2\u20132 in the first leg at the Reebok Stadium, this making for an excellent second leg in the return at Portman Road. The game was marred by 12 Bolton bookings, the sending off of Robbie Elliott and Mike Whitlow and three debatable Ipswich penalties.

Once promoted, Howey continued to be a first-choice centre back but was often missing through injury.
