In addition to Woods, John Daniell, Jack White and Reggie Ingle all captained the side on more than 150 occasions, and Lionel Palairet led the team for one season and Massey Poyntz for two.  Bunty Longrigg was captain of the side either side of the Second World War, totalling 73 matches.  In contrast, the following nine years saw the club utilise eight different official captains, and a number more unofficial ones.  Jack Meyer, who went on to found Millfield, stood down at the end of 1947, his first season as captain.  In 1948, the club committee claimed that it was unable to find anyone of suitable pedigree to lead the side for the whole summer, and was forced to name three captains for the season.  Mandy Mitchell-Innes led the side throughout the pre-season and for the first five matches of the County Championship during leave from the Sudan Political Service. The captaincy then passed onto Jake Seamer, also on leave from the Sudan Political Service, for seven matches, before the committee settled on George Woodhouse, who remained in the position for the following 1949 season.Foot (1986), pp155\u2013156. The next three captains \u2013 Stuart Rogers, Ben Brocklehurst and Gerry Tordoff \u2013 all captained the side for three seasons or less, and in the words of cricket writer and Somerset County Cricket Club historian David Foot, \"captaincy had, ever since the war... been a matter of recurrent concern.\"Foot (1986), p169. This concern, and the fact that there was a lack of amateurs with the necessary time and money to dedicate to the role, meant that in 1956 the club appointed Maurice Tremlett to the role, the county's first professional captain."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bunty Longrigg (1925\u20131947) 219 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Bill Andrews (cricketer)", "response": ["Bunty Longrigg replace Ingle as captain in 1938. He seemed more impressed with Andrews\u2019 batting and he was frequently higher in the batting order. He did the double again although he only needed 47 in the last match of the season and scored 48 in the first innings. Somerset won by an innings so it was his last innings of the season. His best bowling was against Middlesex at Bath when he had match figures of 13-141, a match Somerset won by 9 wickets. With 10 championship wins, including 8 at home, against 9 defeats this was a rare season when Somerset had more victories than losses."]}, {"page": "Harold Stephenson", "response": ["Stephenson was very much one of the professionals and even as captain had little time for the stuffier county cricket element. There were run-ins with the county establishment. Cricket writer David Foot in an obituary of Stephenson reported \"one corrosive exchange with the county chairman, Bunty Longrigg\". Foot reports Stephenson as saying: \"It was my fifth year in charge and we'd got to the Bath Festival. The chairman approached me and asked me bluntly who I thought we should leave out to make way for an amateur or two. I bristled and told him that if he had plans to make changes, he had better skipper the county himself.\""]}, {"page": "Dickie Burrough", "response": ["Like his county captains Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg, Burrough was a solicitor in Bath.

In the Second World War he was a squadron leader in the Royal Air Force.Wisden 1951, p. 919."]}, {"page": "Reggie Ingle", "response": ["A right-handed middle-order batsman, Ingle was a regular player for 10 years in the Somerset side from 1927 to 1937, an era in which the team's batting was dominated by amateur cricketers. A member of a legal family from Bath, Ingle himself practised as a solicitor in the city and for much of the 1930s, the Somerset side had three Bath solicitors in its ranks, with Bunty Longrigg, Ingle's successor as captain, appearing alongside Dickie Burrough."]}, {"page": "John Barnwell (cricketer)", "response": ["John Barnwell was a right-handed batsman who, in a team with a large number of all-rounders, frequently batted as low as No 8 or 9 in the order.

He was also known as a good fielder in the covers."]}, {"page": "Michael Bennett (cricketer)", "response": ["In both 1935 and 1936, Bennett barely played at all, but he came back to the Somerset side in 1937, playing in most of the matches in the first two-thirds of the season. He passed 50 twice, with the higher innings being 62 against Gloucestershire at Taunton, but his aggregate for the season was only 292 runs and his average was just 13.90. He was absent for most of 1938, but came back for a final season in 1939, when he played in half of Somerset's matches and captained the side in the temporary absence of the regular captain, Bunty Longrigg, in games in early July. Mostly he batted a long way down the batting order and it was from No 9 that he made his highest of the season, 72 against Kent at Maidstone, an innings described by Wisden as \"dashing\"\u00a0\u2013 though Somerset still lost the match easily inside two days. His final Somerset match, a month before the outbreak of the Second World War, was against the West Indians; Bennett scored 56 in Somerset's only innings as the county beat the touring side by an innings in less than two days. He did not appear in first-class cricket again."]}, {"page": "Box Case", "response": ["Case's form dipped in 1932 and he managed only 539 runs in the season with an average of 19.96. His one century in the season came in a match against Northamptonshire on his home ground at Frome, when his 112 enabled Somerset to recover from 46 for five to reach 295 in the second innings, though the match was still lost. But he more than doubled his aggregate in the following season, 1933, reaching 1146 runs at an average of 26.65, and this was his best total of runs for a single season. Case's methods did not meet with Wisden's approval in one of his two centuries in the 1933 season: his innings of 132 against Hampshire at Bath took 260 minutes and Case was accused of \"displaying exaggerated care\" in a match where the first day (of three) had been lost to rain and which ended without even two innings being completed. His second century of the summer was an innings of 111 in the match against Middlesex at Weston-super-Mare, when he shared a second-wicket partnership of 184 with Bunty Longrigg, who made a rather faster 101."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Bunty Longrigg"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1948", "response": ["County cricket had sojourned during the Second World War, and only returned in 1946. Most of the players had seen war service in some form or another, and very few of them had played much cricket of any form, which resulted in a temporary drop in quality. As most of the players were the same as those from before the war, it also meant that the average age of a county cricketer was higher than usual.Foot (1986), pp. 147\u2013148. The social change that was occurring all around Great Britain also had an effect on county cricket, and at Somerset it resulted in their professional players gathering together to ask for better playing conditions and greater pay. Despite these changes, and the relative weakness of amateur players in comparison to the professionals, Somerset, as like many other counties, insisted on naming amateurs as captains. In 1946, Bunty Longrigg, who had captained Somerset before the war had resumed his duties, but he retired at the end of the season as was replaced by Jack Meyer for 1947. Meyer had reluctantly agreed to captain the side in the absence of any other candidates, but stepped down at the end of his single season, citing his fading eyesight and lumbago.Roebuck (1991), p. 232."]}, {"page": "David Jones (cricketer, born 1914)", "response": ["Jones made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire against Yorkshire in 1935 County Championship.
