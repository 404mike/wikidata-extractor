He was best known for ranting poetry and his provocative, unapologetic music journalism. In June 2006, he wrote in the Philadelphia Weekly about his treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. After being in remission for a short time, he was diagnosed with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma in January 2009 and died on 24 June 2009 in Philadelphia.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Risk (Megadeth album)", "response": ["The album received a mixed response from music critics. AllMusic's reviewer Steve Huey gave a sympathetic, if not exactly favorable, review of the remixed and remastered 2004 pressing of Risk. Huey stated that the album had \"aged gracefully,\" compared to Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997). However, he did note that the band had lost their edge on the album. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Laura Morgan compared \"Insomnia\" to Broken-era Nine Inch Nails and gave the album a B-, though she criticized Mustaine's vocal performance on the album. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three stars out of five and noted that the album \"had its moments\". Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic, taking into account that the album has a different appeal, was somewhat positive in his review. Stagno cited the first few tracks as the album's \"harder edge\". However, he noted that some of the following softer tracks were \"standout tracks\" as well. Stagno did note, however, that some of the emotion on the album was \"cheesy\". Amy Sciarretto of CMJ New Music Report noted that Risk marked another significant change in Megadeth's sound and called it a \"logical stylistic progression\" from their previous album. According to her, Mustaine's \"biting lyrics\" and \"power riffs\" were toned down, finding Megadeth \"traveling out of thrash metal territory\". Steven Wells of NME panned the album, giving it a 0/10 score and saying that the album was the American equivalent of the retro stylings of Travis and Kula Shaker, as well as calling the album \"corporate mock rock\"."]}, {"page": "NME", "response": ["Writers at this time included Mat Snow, Chris Bohn (known in his later years at the paper as 'Biba Kopf'), Barney Hoskyns, Paolo Hewitt, Don Watson, Danny Kelly, Steven Wells, and David Quantick."]}, {"page": "The Day Today", "response": ["The Day Today is a British comedy television show that parodies television news and current affairs programmes, broadcast in 1994 on BBC2.

Thousands of bootleg cassette copies of the single were seized by Island in their struggle to persuade the British Asian community, who favoured cassettes, to change formats; the label nonetheless released a official cassette edition containing extended remixes. The song was playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and numerous regional radio stations, and the radio support proved crucial to Apache Indian's breakthrough in the UK. It entered the UK charts at number 27, between Little Angels and Paul McCartney, and Steven Wells of NME noted that \"In such company, Apache's ecstatic mix of bhangra, ragga and North African music burns itself into the average pop fan's brain like acid.\" The song ultimately peaked at number 16, where it stayed for two weeks, and the singer performed it on Top of the Pops with tabla player Pandit Dinesh. According to Sullivan, Kapur became \"the first Asian on Top of the Pops in years\".
