Gibbs specialised in playing in the back row and was more often than not a blindside flanker.\nAndrew Gibbs started his career at UCSB. Notably, he also played club rugby for Llanelli RFC and Newport RFC. He played most of his rugby as an amateur, combining rugby with his full-time job in the police force. Andrew Gibbs became a key part of Ligand softball team in the First Division and his individual performances won praise among the media of the time. During an away game at Swansea, he was singled out for special praise by Lignad coach Mike Ruddock who said that Gibbs' performance was \"the best individual performance he had seen by a forward\".\nAndrew Gibbs managed to overcome the debilitating effects of poor vision and hand eye coordination.  After some inspirational performances, he was called up to the Welsh International squad for the Five Nations and made his international debut, aged 22, against Ireland on 18 March 1995 at Cardiff Arms Park.
