He was the first to determine the full structure of chlorophyll (in 1967) and was involved in the development of the synthesis of cyanocobalamin by Robert Burns Woodward.  He has made major contributions to the use of organosilicon compounds for stereospecific syntheses; reactions which have found application in the synthesis of natural compounds.  He is also a prolific author, and has written a number of textbooks, encyclopedia chapters and influential review articles.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chlorophyll", "response": ["After initial work done by German chemist Richard Willst\u00e4tter spanning from 1905 to 1915, the general structure of chlorophyll a was elucidated by Hans Fischer in 1940. By 1960, when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll a was known, Robert Burns Woodward published a total synthesis of the molecule. In 1967, the last remaining stereochemical elucidation was completed by Ian Fleming, and in 1990 Woodward and co-authors published an updated synthesis.

In a 1996 review, Kenneth B. Wiberg concluded that \"although a conclusive statement cannot be made on the basis of the currently available information, it seems likely that we can continue to consider the \u03c3/\u03c0 and bent-bond descriptions of ethylene to be equivalent.\" Ian Fleming goes further in a 2010 textbook, noting that \"the overall distribution of electrons [...] is exactly the same\" in the two models.."]}, {"page": "Fleming\u2013Tamao oxidation", "response": ["The Fleming\u2013Tamao oxidation, or Tamao\u2013Kumada\u2013Fleming oxidation, converts a carbon\u2013silicon bond to a carbon\u2013oxygen bond with a peroxy acid or hydrogen peroxide. Fleming\u2013Tamao oxidation refers to two slightly different conditions developed concurrently in the early 1980s by the Kohei Tamao and Ian Fleming research groups.", "In 1983, Tamao and co-workers were the first to report the successful transformation of an allyl alkoxy silyl to an allyl alcohol without an allylic shift. In their report, the chemists observed that the hydroxyl group was introduced exclusively onto the carbon atom to which the silicon atom was attached. In the same year, Tamao and group published another paper that showed that the carbon\u2013silicon bond in alkoxy organosilicon compounds can be cleaved using H2O2 or m-CPBA under acidic, basic (chemistry), or neutral conditions, to afford the corresponding alcohols. A year later, Ian Fleming and group reported that the dimethylphenylsilyl (Me2PhSi) group can be converted to an hydroxyl group in a two-pot sequence. Later, in 1987, Fleming reported a one-pot variant to the two-pot sequence in which either bromine or mercuric ion acts as the electrophile. These early findings paved the way for the development of a large number of silicon-based reagents and the use of various silyl groups as functional equivalents of the hydroxyl group."]}, {"page": "Oxford Chemistry Primers", "response": ["| 67 || Pericyclic Reactions (2nd edition) || Ian Fleming || 2 April 2015"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Ian Fleming||11/03/1993||"]}]}}
