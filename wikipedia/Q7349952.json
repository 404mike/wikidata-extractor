The first editor-in-chief was Henry Alford, Dean of Canterbury.  The magazine rapidly acquired distinction as a forum for intellectual discussion. It was one of the first periodicals to devote considerable space to the arts.  More particularly, it became an arena for the theological and ecclesiastical disputes which at that time rent the Church of England. Dean Alford retired in 1870 and his successor, J. T. Knowles, greatly enhanced the already established international standing of the journal. He widened the coverage and attracted contributors of great distinction, including Cardinal Manning, John Ruskin, Aldous Huxley, Robert Spence, Henry Stanley, W. E. Gladstone, Matthew Arnold, F. D. Maurice and J. M.
