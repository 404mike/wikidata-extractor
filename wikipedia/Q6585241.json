Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second, and while England lost narrowly, he appeared much more comfortable than the other English batsmen against the googly. Hobbs and Rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in the tour match following the Test, in which Hobbs scored 163.Arlott, p. 56. England also lost the second Test, but Hobbs scored 53 and 70, sharing two substantial opening partnerships with Rhodes. The failure of the other batsmen, defeated by the googly bowlers, caused consternation in the English press.McKinstry, pp. 105\u201306. As England had few effective pace bowlers on the tour, Hobbs opened the bowling in the first two Tests, as well as the batting.McKinstry, p. 110. In the third Test, he scored 93 not out to guide England to a three-wicket victory.McKinstry, pp. 107\u201308. However, the series was lost when England were defeated in the fourth match; Hobbs scored 0and 1, the only time in his Test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings, and his worst match return in first-class cricket.McKinstry, p. 108. In the final game of the series, he scored his first Test hundred, opening the batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with Rhodes which was a record at the time for the first wicket in Test matches. Hobbs scored 187, an innings praised by Wisden for its \"brilliancy\".McKinstry, p. 111. In this match he once more opened the bowling, dismissing Reggie Schwarz, his only Test wicket. England won the match by nine wickets and the series finished 3\u20132 against them. Hobbs scored 1,124 first-class runs at an average of 66.11 on the tour, while in the Test matches, he scored 539 runs at 67.37. None of the other English batsmen came close to matching his success against the googly,Murphy, p. 41. and by the end of the series, critics were beginning to describe him as the world's leading batsman. Wisden commented: \"Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs, who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility. When they came home the other members of the team could not say too much in his praise.\""]}, {"page": "Schwarz (surname)", "response": ["*Reggie Schwarz (1875\u20131918), Anglo-South African cricketer and rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Lee, London", "response": ["* Reggie Schwarz, South African cricketer, was born in Lee."]}, {"page": "Reggie", "response": ["* Reggie Schwarz (1875-1918), South African cricketer"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Reggie Schwarz"]}, {"page": "South Africa national cricket team", "response": ["In the early 1900s, the first world-class South African cricket team emerged, comprising stars such Bonnor Middleton, Jimmy Sinclair, Charlie Llewellyn, Dave Nourse, Louis Tancred, Aubrey Faulkner, Reggie Schwarz, Percy Sherwell, Tip Snooke, Bert Vogler, and Gordon White, players who were capable of giving any international teams a run for their money. In addition to possessing batsmen such as Sinclair (the batsman with the highest strike rate in Test history), Nourse, Tancred, all-rounder Faulkner, Sherwell, Snooker, and White, the South Africans developed the world's first (and arguably greatest) spin attack which specialised in googly. Greatest among the South African googly quartet was Schwarz, who, inspired by English googly bowler Bernard Bosanquet, regarded as the inventor of the googly, developed into the most devastating googly bowler of his time. He taught diligently the secrets of the googly to allrounder Faulkner, medium-pacer Vogler, and specialist batsman White, and together the four formed a quartet which began to lead South Africa to unprecedented heights in Test cricket. Another important force during this period for South Africa was the all-around performances of Faulkner and Llewellyn. Faulkner came to be regarded as the first great South African all-rounders in the international game, regarded by some as even the greatest all-rounder in the world in the pre-1st World War period.Aubrey Faulkner: The first of the great South African all-rounders  Cricket Country. 17 December 2015.

Faulkner came to the notice of the South African selectors when he scored a half-century and took six wickets with his googlies to lead Transvaal to a surprise win over the touring 1905/06 MCC side in just his fourth first-class match. He was promptly selected for his Test debut in the first Test of the series against England at Johannesburg, where he was part of a four-man googly attack along with Schwarz, Bert Vogler and Gordon White. Faulkner's match figures of 6/61 helped South Africa record their maiden Test victory, and he retained his place throughout the whole series, being a significant contributor to South Africa's 4\u20131 series victory and at times being more difficult to play than any of the other South African bowlers."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Sinclair", "response": ["In South Africa's next Test series, against the English tourists in 1905\u201306, Sinclair made 160 runs at an average of 20.00 and took 21 wickets at 19.90 in South Africa's first series victory. By this stage other South Africans were also contributing substantially, such as the all-rounder Aubrey Faulkner and his fellow leg-spinners Reggie Schwarz, Bert Vogler and Gordon White, and the 4\u20131 series victory was a team effort.
