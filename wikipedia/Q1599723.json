He is best known as the commander who was decisively defeated in 1813 by the Americans and left western Upper Canada in American hands. Procter is regarded by many as an inept leader who relied heavily on textbook procedure. His \"going by the book\" is attributed to his lack of any combat experience before coming to Canada.", "link_mentions": {}}}
