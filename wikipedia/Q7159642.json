The band has been marketed with three different names on their three releases. In 1995, they were marketed as g//z/r, in 1997, it was merely geezer, and in 2005 it was GZR. Most fans refer to the band as geezer, although Butler himself refers to the band name as \"gee-zed-R\". This incarnation of the band is not to be confused with Butler's previous attempt in 1985 to form a solo band, then known as the Geezer Butler Band \u2013 the two outfits are largely unrelated.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "GZR", "response": ["The band's music is generally of a much harder edge than Butler is known for in Black Sabbath. This is not a surprise, as the vocalist on his first album (Plastic Planet) was Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory, who is known for more driving and harder edged vocals than ever was displayed in Black Sabbath. Before taking on Bell as vocalist for the debut album Plastic Planet, Butler contacted Devin Townsend to perform vocals. However, due to Townsend's recent stint with Steve Vai and having had to sing lyrics not written by himself, he was unwilling to enter into another band where he would have no lyrical input. Plastic Planet also featured Pedro Howse, Butler's nephew, on guitars, as well as Deen Castronovo of Journey on drums. Bell did not stay with the band past the recording of Plastic Planet, due to Fear Factory commitments.", "*Pedro Howse \u2013 guitars", " bar:Pedro  text:\"Pedro Howse\""]}, {"page": "Ohmwork", "response": ["* Pedro Howse \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Black Science", "response": ["* Pedro Howse \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Plastic Planet", "response": ["All songs written by Geezer Butler and Pedro Howse.", "* Pedro Howse \u2013 guitar (link error)"]}, {"page": "Geezer Butler Band", "response": ["Along with Butler, the band consisted of guitarist Pedro Howse, who would later also play in GZR with Butler.
