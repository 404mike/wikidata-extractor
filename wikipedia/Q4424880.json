He is most famous for his work on the Manhattan Project where he was responsible for the production of fissionable metals. A graduate of the University of Birmingham and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Smith worked for many years as a research metallurgist at the American Brass Company. During World War II he worked in the Chemical-Metallurgical Division of the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he purified, cast and shaped uranium-235 and plutonium, a metal hitherto available only in microgram amounts, and whose properties were largely unknown. After the war he served on the Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, and the President's Science Advisory Committee.\nSmith founded the Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first interdisciplinary academic organization devoted to the study of metals in the United States. He studied the details of faults and grain boundaries in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. In 1961, he moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. He applied the techniques of metallurgy to the study of the production methods used to create artefacts such as samurai swords.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stained glass", "response": ["* Theophilus (ca 1100).

Cyril Stanley Smith & Martha Teach Gnudi, New York: The American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, 1942, pp. 136-141 Georg Agricola and Lazarus Ercker, among others, wrote about the art of mining and testing the ores, as well as detailed descriptions of cupellation. Their descriptions and assumptions have been identified within diverse archaeological findings through Medieval and Renaissance Europe. By these times the amount of fire assays increased considerably, mainly because of testing the ores in the mines in order to identify the availability of its exploitation. A primary use of cupellation was related to minting activities, and it was also used in testing jewelry.  Since the Renaissance, cupellation became a standardised method of analysis that has changed very little, demonstrating its efficiency. Its development certainly touched the spheres of economy, politics, warfare and power in ancient times."]}, {"page": "Bishop Vesey's Grammar School", "response": ["* Cyril Stanley Smith, metallurgist and historian of science"]}, {"page": "Japanese swordsmithing", "response": ["During the folding process, most of the impurities are removed from the steel, continuously refining the steel while forging. By the end of forging, the steel produced was among the purest steel alloys of the ancient world. Continuous heating causes the steel to decarburize, so a good quantity of carbon is either extracted from the steel as carbon dioxide or redistributed more evenly through diffusion, leaving a nearly eutectoid composition (containing 0.77 to 0.8% carbon).Metallography and Microstructure in Ancient and Historic Metals by David A. Scott -- The J Paul Getty Trust 1991 Page 29 The edge steel will generally end up with a composition that ranges from eutectoid to slightly hypoeutectoid (containing a carbon content under the eutectoid composition), giving enough hardenability without sacrificing ductility. The skin steel generally has slightly less carbon, often in the range of 0.5%. The core steel, however, remains nearly pure iron, responding very little to heat treatment. Cyril Stanley Smith, a professor of metallurgical history from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, performed an analysis of four different swords, each from a different century, determining the composition of the surface of the blades:The Sword and the Crucible: A History of the metallurgy of European swords up to the 16th century by Alan Williams -- Brill 2012 page 42--43", "thumb|The different layers in this blade are evident by the difference in their carbon content, which is exaggerated at the hamon giving it a wispy appearance. According to Smith, the different layers of steel are made visible during the polishing because of one or both of two reasons: 1) the layers have a variation in carbon content, or 2) they have variation in the content of slag inclusions. When the variation is from slag inclusions by themselves, there will not be a noticeable effect near the hamon, where the yakiba meets the hira. Likewise, there will be no appreciable difference in the local hardness of the individual layers. A difference in slag inclusions generally appears as layers that are somewhat pitted while the adjacent layers are not. In one of the first metallurgical studies, Professor Kuni-ichi Tawara suggests that layers of high slag may have been added for practical as well as decorative reasons. Although slag has a weakening effect on the metal, layers of high slag may have been added to diffuse vibration and dampen recoil, allowing easier use without a significant loss in toughness.A History of Metallography by Cyril Stanley Smith -- MIT Press 1960 Page 46--47", "Metallurgy did not arise as a science until the early 20th century. Before this, metallography was the primary method used for studying metals. Metallography is the study of the patterns in metals, the nature of fractures, and the microscopic crystal formations. However, neither metallography as a science nor the crystal theory of metals emerged until nearly a century after the invention of the microscope.A History of Metallography by Cyril Stanley Smith -- MIT Press 1960 Page xxi -- xxvi The ancient swordsmiths had no knowledge of metallurgy, nor did they understand the relationship between carbon and iron. Everything was typically learned by a process of trial-and-error, apprenticeship, and, as sword-making technology was often a closely guarded secret, some espionage. Prior to the 14th century, very little attention was paid to the patterns in the blade as an aesthetic quality. However, the Japanese smiths often prided themselves on their understanding of the internal macro-structure of metals.", "In Japan, steel-making technology was imported from China, most likely through Korea. The crucible steel used in the Chinese swords, called chi-kang (combined steel), was similar to pattern welding, and edges of it were often forge welded to a back of soft iron, or . In trying to copy the Chinese method, the ancient smiths paid much attention to the various properties of steel and worked to combine them to produce an internal macro-structure that would provide a similar combination of hardness and toughness. Like all trial-and-error, each swordsmith often attempted to produce an internal structure that was superior to swords of their predecessors, or even ones that were better than their own previous designs.A History of Metallography by Cyril Stanley Smith -- MIT Press 1960 Page 41 The harder metals provided strength, like \"bones\" within the steel, whereas the softer metal provided ductility, allowing the swords to bend before breaking. In ancient times, the Japanese smiths would often display these inhomogeneities in the steel, especially on fittings like the guard or pommel, creating rough, natural surfaces by letting the steel rust or by pickling it in acid, making the internal structure part of the entire aesthetic of the weapon.", "In later times, this effect was often imitated by partially mixing various metals like copper together with the steel, forming mokume (wood-eye) patterns, although this was unsuitable for the blade. After the 14th century, more advancement was made in improving the mechanical properties, and more attention began to be paid to the patterns in the blade as an aesthetic quality. Intentionally decorative forging techniques were often employed, such as hammering dents in certain locations or drawing out the steel with fullers, which served to create a mokume pattern when the sword was filed and polished into shape, or by intentionally forging in layers of high slag content. By the 17th century, decorative hardening methods were often being used to increase the beauty of the blade, by shaping the clay. Hamons with trees, flowers, pill boxes, or other shapes became common during this era. By the 19th century, the decorative hamons were often being combined with decorative folding techniques to create entire landscapes, often portraying specific islands or scenery, crashing waves in the ocean, and misty mountain peaks.A History of Metallography by Cyril Stanley Smith -- MIT Press 1960 Page 50--52, 57--61"]}, {"page": "British and Irish stained glass (1811\u20131918)", "response": ["* Theophilus, On Divers Arts, trans. from Latin by John G.
