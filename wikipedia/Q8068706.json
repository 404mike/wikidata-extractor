The Kahans lived at 6 Clapton Square in Hackney, London. She became an active socialist and joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF).  Within the SDF, she was a leading opponent of Ernest Belfort Bax's anti-feminism, and an ardent anti-militarist.  After a resolution she proposed to the conference of the SDF's successor, the British Socialist Party, was approved against the wishes of the party leadership, she was elected to its executive.  She worked alongside Theodore Rothstein in opposition to World War I, and supported the foundation of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).Kahan married fellow communist William Peyton Coates (died 8 Aug 1963), and became known as Zelda Coates.  Together, they set up the Anglo-Russian Parliamentary Committee.  \nThe Coates lived at 37 Coolhurst Road, Hornsey, London N8 in later days.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Rothstein", "response": ["The SDF leader, Henry Hyndman, was acutely disturbed by the election to the SDF executive in 1900 of Theodore Rothstein.

As early as 1909, he was a signatory to a resolution denouncing party leader H. M. Hyndman's anti-German rhetoric.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, p.232  He supported closer links with the Independent Labour Party and other socialists, and worked with Alf Purcell and Victor Grayson on the Provisional Committee for the Promotion of Common Ground Among the Socialists.  This was opposed by the right-wing of the SDF, but proved successful, as it constituted the British Socialist Party (BSP), and the SDF merged itself into the new party.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, pp.238-240"]}, {"page": "Far-left politics in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The SDF eventually morphed into a new Marxist party, the British Socialist Party, along with some members on the left of the ILP, with Hyndman leading. With the advent of the First World War conflict arose between \"internationalist\" and \"national defence\" factions, with Hyndman taking a nationalist stance. Vladimir Lenin, who had visited London six times from 1902 to 1911, was critical of this and supported the internationalists. Matters came to a head in 1916, when the defeated Hyndman left to found the National Socialist Party, while his internationalist opponents Alf watts, Zelda Kahan and Theodore Rothstein supported the Zimmerwald Conference. In Scotland, the BSP's John Maclean was involved in the Red Clydeside movement. From 1916 to 1920, the British Socialist Party would be the largest proto-communist party in Britain and, although affiliated to the Labour Party for the 1918 general election, was shortly afterwards the largest founding group of the Communist Party of Great Britain."]}, {"page": "Zelda K.
