One classical such representation is Burau representation, where the matrix entries are single variable Laurent polynomials. It had been a long-standing question whether Burau representation was faithful, but the answer turned out to be negative for . More generally, it was a major open problem whether braid groups were linear. In 1990, Ruth Lawrence described a family of more general \"Lawrence representations\" depending on several parameters. In 1996, Chetan Nayak and Frank Wilczek posited that in analogy to projective representations of , the projective representations of the braid group have a physical meaning for certain quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall effect. Around 2001 Stephen Bigelow and Daan Krammer independently proved that all braid groups are linear. Their work used the Lawrence\u2013Krammer representation of dimension n(n-1)/2 depending on the variables  and . By suitably specializing these variables, the braid group B_n may be realized as a subgroup of the general linear group over the complex numbers."]}, {"page": "1990 in science", "response": ["* Ruth Lawrence publishes a paper on homological representations of the Hecke algebra, introducing, among other things, certain novel linear representations of the braid group, the Lawrence\u2013Krammer representation."]}, {"page": "1971 in science", "response": ["* August 2 \u2013 Ruth Lawrence, English-born mathematician."]}, {"page": "Ruth Elke Lawrence", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ruth Lawrence"]}, {"page": "Ruth lawrence", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ruth Lawrence "]}, {"page": "1985 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** 13-year-old Ruth Lawrence achieves a first in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, becoming the youngest British person ever to earn a first-class degree and the youngest known graduate of the university."]}, {"page": "Hothousing", "response": ["*Ruth Lawrence"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Ruth Lawrence, mathematician and child prodigy"]}, {"page": "List of women in mathematics", "response": ["* Ruth Lawrence (born 1971), child prodigy, British-Israeli researcher in knot theory and algebraic topology"]}, {"page": "List of Jewish mathematicians", "response": ["* Ruth Lawrence (born 1971), knot theory and algebraic topology"]}, {"page": "List of people by Erd\u0151s number", "response": ["* Ruth Lawrence"]}, {"page": "Lawrence\u2013Krammer representation", "response": ["The Lawrence\u2013Krammer representation is named after Ruth Lawrence and Daan Krammer.
