She took over the role from model/actress Samantha Rowley, who had played the character since November 2005, but was subsequently axed because the producers wished to take the character, who had been cast as a likeable teenager until this point, into a darker and more \"evil\" persona, and Rowley did not want to play a villain. Hollyoaks producer Bryan Kirkwood commented, \"Gemma was a fantastic asset to the Hollyoaks cast. Recasting Gemma in the role of Clare was the first thing I did when I joined Hollyoaks and it was a decision which paid off handsomely.

Bissix reprised the role in 2009 for the culmination of Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) and Justin Burton's (Chris Fountain) storylines. She later returned to the show in 2013. Clare was killed-off in October 2013, and Bissix said that it would allow Hollyoaks to develop other villainous characters. Bissix has won three British Soap Awards for her portrayal of Clare, and has been named one of the best British soap opera characters.", "The character was first introduced to Hollyoaks in December 2005, by series producer David Hanson portrayed by Samantha Rowley. The character was introduced as an events manager for The Loft nightclub, and as the story progressed, the new girlfriend of Max Cunningham, and appeared initially from 2005 to 2006, when new series producer Bryan Kirkwood decided to recast the role to Gemma Bissix after wanting to take the character in a new direction.  Speaking on the Hollyoaks Podcast in 2020: Bixsix recalled \"[Samantha] came from a model show of some kind, and that's when Hollyoaks were criticised for bringing people in that were models and weren't acting. That's when Hollyoaks was downgraded and it was all about what you look like. \"When Bryan came in, he took it upon himself \u2013 it was literally like Pippa from Home and Away. She went upstairs with Max one night, then the next morning, I came down. I think they liked the press of it \u2013 it was an impact.\" Bissix had previously auditioned for five other roles on the show, and was reluctant to audition for the role of Clare.", "When Clare originally arrived in 2005 played by Samantha Rowley, she was rather likeable and friendly. However, after the character's recast to Gemma Bissix the following year, the character revealed a dark side and this was quickly revealed around Hollyoaks. Clare became a con-woman, marrying Max Cunningham simply for his money. Clare made several attempts to kill Max, however was unsuccessful. In 2007, Clare was pushed over the balcony at The Loft. This attempt on her life led to her departure from the series, in which, her enemies assumed she had died. Almost two years later, Clare returned for her revenge on Warren Fox and Justin Burton, where she was arrested for Warren's murder."]}, {"page": "Make Me a Supermodel (British TV series)", "response": ["|Katie Black, Juliet Horne, Jackie Turner, Patsy Kigozi, Camilla Hamilton, Jasmine Lennard, Abigail Boston & Emily Mann, Antoinette Williams, Samantha Rowley, Joanna Downes", "|Samantha Rowley"]}, {"page": "List of British actors", "response": ["* Samantha Rowley (born 1988)"]}, {"page": "History of Hollyoaks", "response": ["Kirkwood introduced the new character of Mercedes McQueen, played by Jennifer Metcalfe.
