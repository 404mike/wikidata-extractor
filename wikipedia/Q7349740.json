It was first published by Comma Press in Shearman\u2019s 2007 anthology Tiny Deaths, and won a World Fantasy Award. The story itself was then adapted into a short film, which took the action back to the United States, but kept the present day setting. The themes of loss and longing for a simpler romanticised past are prevalent in all three versions."]}, {"page": "Doctor Who Magazine", "response": ["| Story Robert Shearman; pencils Mike Collins; ink David A.

Davies also approached his old friend Paul Abbott and Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling to write for the series; both declined due to existing commitments. Shortly after he secured writers for the show, Davies stated he had no intention of approaching writers from the old series; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Holmes, who died in May 1986."]}, {"page": "Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation", "response": ["| Doctor Who: \"Dalek\" || Joe Ahearne (director), Robert Shearman (screenplay) || BBC Cymru Wales/BBC One"]}, {"page": "David Walliams", "response": ["Walliams was born at St Teresa's Maternity Hospital in Wimbledon, in the London Borough of Merton, in 1971.
