Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between both of them, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher John Lane and the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley when they themselves objected to the poor standard of Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to Robbie Ross: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but in a gesture of reconciliation suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title page.

Diversifying his employment, In 1906, Spare published his first political cartoon, a satire on the use of Chinese wage slave labourers in British South Africa, which appeared in the pages of The Morning Leader newspaper.Baker 2011. p. 31. When not involved in these jobs, he devoted much of his time to illustrating a second publication, A Book of Satyrs, which consisted of a series of nine satirical images lampooning such institutions as politics and the clergy. The volume contained a number of self-portraits; he also filled many of the images with illustrations of bric-a-brac, of which he was a great collector. The book was finished off with an introduction authored by Scottish painter James Guthrie.Baker 2011. pp. 42\u201344, 47.

Meanwhile, in 1907 Spare produced one of his most significant illustrations, a drawing titled Portrait of the Artist, featuring himself sitting behind a table covered in assorted bric-a-brac. His later biographer Phil Baker would later characterise it as \"a remarkable work of Edwardian black-and-white art\" which was \"far more confidently drawn and better finished than the work of the Satyrs\".Baker 2011. p. 44.", "In July 1914, Spare held another exhibition of his work, this time at the Baillie Gallery in Bruton St, London.Baker 2011. p. 111.

At the same time, he was involved in a newly launched popular art magazine known as Colour, which was edited in Victoria Street, submitting a number of contributions to its early issues. He soon developed the idea of founding his own art magazine, suggesting the idea to the publisher John Lane, who had formerly produced The Yellow Book, an influential periodical that had appeared between 1894 to 1897. Envisioning his new venture, titled Form, as a successor to The Yellow Book, he was joined as co-editor by the etcher Frederick Carter, who used the pseudonym of Francis Marsden.Baker 2011. pp. 111\u2013112. The first issue appeared in the summer of 1916, containing contributions from Edmund Joseph Sullivan, Walter de la Mare, Frank Brangwyn, W.H. Davies, J.C. Squire, Ricketts and Shannon. Spare and Carter co-wrote an article discussing automatic writing, arguing that it allowed the unconscious part of the mind to produce art, a theme that Spare had previously dealt with in The Book of Pleasure.Baker 2011. pp. 112\u2013113. Generally, Form was poorly received by the critics and the public, being described as a \"very horrible publication\" by George Bernard Shaw, who proclaimed its design and layout to be \"ancient Morrisian\" and thereby out of fashion.Baker 2011. pp. 116\u2013117.

Machen only viewed the two works as connected after they were finished. Once he decided the two stories were connected, Machen wrote the rest of The Great God Pan in a single evening save for its final chapter. Machen did not think of an ending for the tale for months, and in that time believed that the novella would remain unfinished forever. The last chapter was completed in June 1891. Machen sent the novella to the publisher Blackwood, who rejected it, deeming it a clever story that \"shrink[s]...from the central idea.\" It was accepted by John Lane and published in 1894. When published as a book, The Great God Pan was accompanied by another Machen tale called \"The Inmost Light\" which also features a mad scientist and elements of science fiction. The book's cover was illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley.", "The Great God Pan implied sexuality caused a scandal upon its original release and hurt Machen's reputation as an author. Reviewing the novella for the magazine Literary News, Richard Henry Stoddard criticised the story as \"too morbid to be the production of a healthy mind\".Richard Henry Stoddard, \"Review of \"The Great God Pan\"\", in: Colavito, Jason, ed. A Hideous Bit of Morbidity: An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008. p. 228-230)  The art critic Harry Quilter's review of the book, titled \"The Gospel of Intensity\", and published in The Contemporary Review in June 1895, was even more harsh. Quilter declared: \"The Great God Pan' is, I have no hesitation in saying, a perfectly abominable story, in which the author has spared no endeavor to suggest loathsomeness and horror which he describes as beyond the reach of words.\"Harry Quilter, \"The Gospel of Intensity\", in Colavito, ed. A Hideous Bit of Morbidity: An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I. Jefferson,NC: McFarland, 2008. (p. 230-254).  Quilter warned that Machen's books were a dangerous threat to the entire British public and that they would destroy readers' sanities and senses of morality. Quilter went on to attack the story's publisher, John Lane, as well as Machen himself: \"Why should he be allowed, for the sake of a few miserable pounds, to cast into our midst these monstrous creations of his diseased brain?\" Quilter added that works of fiction like Machen's should be unanimously condemned by literary critics and newspapers: \"If the Press was so disposed it could stamp out such art and fiction in a few months: And that disposition must be acquired, must even be enforced.\" He was particularly harsh in his denunciation of sexual ambiguity and polymorphous androgyny in the book. He expressed revulsion at Machen's description of Helen's sex changing immediately before her death and concluded his review with a comment of distaste regarding the \"nasty little naked figure of dubious sex and humanity with which Mr. Aubrey Beardsley has prefaced the story\". A positive appraisal of the novella came from Oscar Wilde, who called it \"un succ\u00e8s fou.\""]}, {"page": "Edward Hutton (writer)", "response": ["Edward Hutton was born in Hampstead, London, his father being a businessman with interests in Sheffield.
