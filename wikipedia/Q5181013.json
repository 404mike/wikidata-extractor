Hartlepool started the 2017\u201318 season with just one win from seven attempts. However, a win at Guiseley kick-started a run of only one defeat in thirteen matches. By November, off-field financial issues intensified which coincided with a winless run of eleven games. In a statement, Pam Duxbury (then chairwoman) claimed that a number of \"legacy issues have consumed high financial and human resources\" and that the club needed \u00a3200,000 in order to survive. In response to the financial issues, fans set up a JustGiving page which raised just over \u00a385,000, including donations from supporters across the UK and a \u00a32,500 boost by the former Middlesbrough striker Danny Graham. An initiative called 'Save Pools Day' took place on 20 January 2018 for a fixture against Wrexham where supporters from other clubs visited to raise funds via ticket sales. Hartlepool lost 2\u20130 with 6,833 supporters in attendance. The poor run of form resulted in the sacking of Craig Harrison in February who was replaced by caretaker manager Matthew Bates. Bates' first win came on 21 March during the televised away fixture at Barrow. During this match, Hartlepool went 1\u20130 down and briefly fell into the relegation places. Hartlepool won three consecutive matches to pull away from the relegation places and finally guaranteed safety from relegation on 17 April with a win against Leyton Orient. Hartlepool's first season in non-league ended with the club avoiding liquidation when Raj Singh bought the club in April. Hartlepool ultimately finished a turbulent season in 15th place."]}, {"page": "Airbus UK Broughton F.C.", "response": ["* Craig Harrison (July 2008 \u2013 2011)"]}, {"page": "Andy Frampton", "response": ["Frampton progressed through the youth system at Crystal Palace before breaking into the first team and making his Football League debut at the age of 19 on 3 April 1999 in a 1\u20130 win over Norwich City at Carrow Road. He went on to make five more appearances for the club during the 1998\u201399 season, with the club ultimately finishing 14th in the league.

The 21-year\u2013old defender made another ten league appearances in the 2000\u20132001 season. Crystal Palace struggled throughout the season however and only prevented relegation to the Second Division on the final day, beating Stockport County 1\u20130 on 6 May 2001. Frampton found his first-team opportunities limited during the 2001\u201302, playing just two matches in April 2002, as he proved unable to compete with Craig Harrison as first choice left-back. The defender made two appearances for Crystal Palace during the 2002\u201303 season, however, having failed to cement his place in the first-team, Frampton subsequently joined Football League Second Division club Brentford on a free transfer on 28 October 2002."]}, {"page": "Matthew Bates", "response": ["When Craig Harrison was appointed as Hartlepool's first-team manager in May 2017, Bates moved into a coaching role with the club's U21s side.", "On 21 February 2018, Bates took charge of Hartlepool again following the dismissal of Craig Harrison.
