Having returned to the first-team squad, mostly appearing as a substitute, he then had a goal assist for Aidan Smith in a 1\u20131 draw at Ibrox versus the Govan club  and then on 21 March 2015 scored his first goal of that season in a 4\u20131 win versus Cowdenbeath. Paton's second season saw him playing on 23 occasions and scoring one goal in all competitions.
