The German musicians got acquainted with drummer Mike Terrana and Savatage guitarist Chris Caffery through Ratz's own management company during a European tour of the two Americans. The five musicians worked together on a single concept album project with a science fiction/fantasy storyline and speed metal style, to be released before the new millennium. The story is about Michael, a metal fan, who drinks a magic potion and becomes the invincible warrior Metalian. The debut Metalium album Millennium Metal \u2013 Chapter One was released in 1999 and was a success in Germany, peaking at No. 75 in the German chart and receiving positive reviews. The success of the first album ensured the continuation of the band's career, as well as new adventures for the Metalian, the main character of Metalium's ongoing saga. Jack Frost and Mark Cross replaced Caffery and Terrana respectively for the second album State of Triumph \u2013 Chapter Two, released in 2000. Both Frost and Cross had left the band by the end of 2001, leaving Lange as the only guitarist for studio recordings and introducing Michael Ehr\u00e9 on drums in time for Metalium's third album of 2002.

The reason for the split was that Gus wanted to have a set of Greek-based musicians willing to make Firewind their number one priority (probably to end the virtual revolving door of members) and Stian's main band was the Norwegian outfit Pagan's Mind.
