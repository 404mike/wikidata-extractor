Both films were based on plays cowrittened by Ivor Novello, Graham Cutts, Constance Collier and Reginald Fogwell. Jeans also returned to reprise her role from the first film, as did Marie Ault and Julie Suedo. A notable absence is the character of Odile, a central figure in The Rat as played by Mae Marsh.  At the end of the previous film Pierre had seemingly rejected the lure of life in high society as represented by the Jeans character of Z\u00e9lie, and he and Odile had finally realised the depth of their love for each other. However The Triumph of the Rat finds him back with Z\u00e9lie, and not only does Odile not appear in the film, but not even a passing mention is made as to what might have happened in the interim to cause her to disappear so completely from Pierre's life.  This reportedly puzzled contemporary audiences, and while some later observers have theorised that The Triumph of the Rat is meant to present an alternative reality in which Pierre chose Z\u00e9lie over Odile at the end of the original film, there is no evidence that anything so sophisticated was ever the intention."]}, {"page": "The Written Law", "response": ["The Written Law is a 1931 British drama film directed by Reginald Fogwell and starring Madeleine Carroll, Percy Marmont and Henry Hewitt.BFI.org The screenplay concerns a man who is cured of blindness but conceals his recovery from his wife.", "Category:Films directed by Reginald Fogwell"]}, {"page": "The Wonderful Story (1932 film)", "response": ["The Wonderful Story is a 1932 British drama film directed by Reginald Fogwell and starring Wyn Clare, John Batten and Moore Marriott.BFI.org It was based on the 1921 short story of the same name written by I.A.R.
