In a first-class career lasting from 1877 to 1889 he played 250 matches, 8 of which were Test matches. In 1889 he was awarded a benefit by Lancashire: he raised \u00a31,500. \nHis first appearance in the Lancashire eleven dates back to the season of 1877. His appearance for Lancashire was very happily timed, as, with Mr. E. Jackson so often prevented by business reasons from playing, the northern county might have been left without a first-class wicket-keeper. Almost from the first time he was seen in the Lancashire team it was felt that a great wicket-keeper had arisen, and he at once sprang into the front rank. From August, 1877, down to the end of the season of 1889 he was a regular member of the Lancashire eleven, and several pages of Wisden might easily be filled with a record of his doings. For all the hard work he has done in the cricket field, Pilling was never constitutionally robust, and the serious illness which kept him out of the cricket field in 1890 originated in a severe cold which he caught during the winter when taking part in a football match. At the end of the summer he journeyed to Australia for the benefit of his health, leaving in the same steamer that took a large proportion of the Australian team. In 1891, Pilling was rated by Wisden to the second-best wicket-keeper in the world, with Jack Blackham being rated the best. His style was described as the perfection of neatness and rapidity, without the least unnecessary show. \nPilling visited Australia with Alfred Shaw and Shrewsbury's team in 1881/2, and went out again under the same auspices in the winter of 1887/8, and it was on these tours and in games played at Lancashire's home ground of Old Trafford that he played his Test matches. At the time, it was feared that much of his subsequent ill-health dates from a sunstroke that he suffered during the former of these trips. As a batsman Pilling had an excellent style, and had often done capital work for his county. This led to Pilling being named as the Wisden Wicket-keeper of the Year in 1891. Unfortunately the accolade turned out to be a posthumous one. To try to improve his deteriorating health, he was sent on a cruise to Australia by Lancashire County Cricket Club in the winter 1890/1. It did not work, and Pilling died six days after returning home.\nPilling was a stonemason by trade, and had a wife, Emma, and at least one child, Mary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1890 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Great Wicket-Keepers \u2013 Jack Blackham, Gregor MacGregor, Dick Pilling, Mordecai Sherwin, Henry Wood"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Dick Pilling"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The early Lancashire side was reliant upon amateurs, which led to problems; although they were happy to play at Old Trafford, they were less willing to travel to away fixtures. During the early 1870s, the team was dominated by A. N. Hornby\u2019s batting. The team's standard of cricket improved with the arrival of two professional players, Dick Barlow and Alex Watson. The impact of Barlow and Hornby was such that their batting partnership was immortalised in the poem At Lord\u2019s  by Francis Thompson. The team was further enhanced by A. G. Steel, an amateur sometimes considered second only to W. G. Grace as the country's best all rounder; Johnny Briggs, a professional from Sutton-in-Ashfield and the only player to score 10,000\u00a0runs and take 1,000\u00a0wickets for Lancashire; and wicket-keeper Dick Pilling, who in 1891 was rated by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as the second-best wicket-keeper in the world behind Jack Blackham. As Lancashire's consistency improved, so did their support: in 1878, 28,000 over three days watched Lancashire play Gloucestershire. Retrieved on 20\u00a0October 2007.", "Controversy emerged during the 1880s; Kent and Nottinghamshire objected to the bowling actions of John Crossland and George Nash. Nottinghamshire even went as far as refusing to play against Lancashire. Although the 1880s was a period of controversy and modest results for the club, it was also a time in which some club records were established. In 1885 George Kemp (later 1st Baron Rochdale) scored Lancashire's first century in a Roses Match. In that same year Johnny Briggs and Dick Pilling set a first-class record partnership for the tenth wicket of 173 that stood until 1899 and has not been bettered by Lancashire. The club shared the title of champions with Surrey in 1889.", "|Johnny Briggs and Dick Pilling"]}, {"page": "Johnny Briggs (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1885, Briggs developed greatly as a bowler: having scarcely bowled at all in previous seasons, he took 67 wickets for 13.74 each, and in 1886, his bowling helped England achieve a 3\u20130 cleansweep of the series, their last whitewash victory in a series of three or more Tests in the Ashes until 1977. His batting did not suffer: Briggs hit a career-best 186 against Surrey at Liverpool \u2013 adding a then-record 173 for the tenth wicket with Dick Pilling.Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 127. Published 1951 by Playfair Books. In the exceptionally dry summer of 1887, Briggs took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, whilst in the summer of 1888 he was consistently deadly on the treacherous pitches. His 160 wickets cost only 10.49 each, and the following year he was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He played well in South Africa\u2019s first two Test matches in 1888/9 (only canonised as such much later), taking 15 for 28 in the second Test, of which fourteen were clean bowled."]}, {"page": "1890 English cricket season", "response": ["* Wisden (Five Great Wicket-Keepers) \u2013 Jack Blackham, Gregor MacGregor, Dick Pilling, Mordecai Sherwin, Henry Wood"]}, {"page": "Richard Pilling", "response": ["#redirectDick Pilling"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Dick Pilling \u00b7"]}, {"page": "1885 English cricket season", "response": ["* On 17 July, Johnny Briggs and Dick Pilling playing for Lancashire against Surrey set a record stand for the tenth wicket of 173, which stands until 1899.Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 127.
