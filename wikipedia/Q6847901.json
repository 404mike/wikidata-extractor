Among those who left the club were Harold Andrews, who joined Bury,Dykes, p. 17 and Irish international inside forward Billy Halligan, who retired from professional football.

In the highest scoring match of the day, Nelson lost the match 2\u20136 before a crowd of 10,000 who witnessed Joe Eddleston score his first goal of the season. Bradford Park Avenue were again the opponents the following week for Nelson's first home game of the campaign and the match was won 1\u20130 by the host side courtesy of a Mike McCulloch goal. Eddleston's second goal of the campaign secured another 1\u20130 victory, this time against Stalybridge Celtic, at Seedhill on 9 September 1922 to send the team seventh in the table after three matches. A third successive home fixture saw Nelson win 2\u20130 against Halifax Town with two goals from Eddleston. Nelson could not follow up their earlier victory over Stalybridge Celtic, falling to a 0\u20132 loss before attaining a fourth win of the campaign against Southport a week later. Another win against Southport, Nelson's fourth since joining the league in 1921, meant September ended as it had started with a 1\u20130 win which marked Nelson's fifth victory and clean sheet of the month.Dykes, p. 76", "|align=\"left\"|Mike McCulloch"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Mike McCulloch"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["While there were several changed to the playing staff, the core of the team that had played in the Second Division remained intact.
