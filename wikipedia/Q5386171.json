When the studio folded in 1949, Bradbury and Clarke took samples to Amalgamated Press, and were offered work at Knock-Out, edited by Leonard Matthews \u2014 Clarke writing, Bradbury drawing. He started out on humour strips like Blossom and Our Ernie, but soon specialised in adventure strips, particularly westerns like Lucky Logan, on which he alternated with former G-B colleague Mike Western, and Buffalo Bill, both in The Comet. For the same title, he drew an adaptation of the 1955 film The King's Thief.From the 1960s on he developed a dark style similar to Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez, and drew strips like Mytek the Mighty, The House of Dolmann, and The Black Crow for Valiant, Phantom Force 5, The Leopard from Lime Street (inking Mike Western's pencils) and Maxwell Hawke for Buster, Von Hoffman's Invasion for Jet, and Cursitor Doom for Smash!. In 1973 he was the artist on an abortive IPC superhero comic, Captain Britain (no relation to the later Marvel UK character). He joined Battle Picture Weekly in 1976 when Valiant was folded into it, taking The Black Crow with it. Other strips he drew for Battle included Joe Two Beans, Coward's Brand on Bradley, Crazy Keller, Death Squad, The Fists of Jimmy Chang and Invasion 1984. He also drew Hook Jaw for Action.He was described by 2000 AD as one of their \"early, unsung heroes,\" drawing for them from the early issues in 1977 until 1993, including Invasion!, The Mean Arena and Rogue Trooper, as well as numerous Tharg the Mighty stories and Future Shocks. He also drew Doomlord for the revived Eagle in the 1980s.Bradbury died in May 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Bolland", "response": ["As early as 1962, aged 11, Bolland remembers thinking that \"Carmine Infantino's work on the Flash and Gil Kane's on Green Lantern and the Atom had a sophistication about it that I hadn't [previously] seen.\" He would later cite Kane and Alex Toth as \"pinnacle[s] of excellence,\" alongside \"Curt Swan, Murphy Anderson, Sid Greene, Joe Kubert, Ross Andru, Mike Esposito, Nick Cardy and the under-rated Bruno Premiani,\" whose influences showed in his \"early crude stabs at drawing comics.\" The young Bolland did not rate Marvel Comics as highly as DC, feeling the covers cluttered and the paper quality crude.
