The documentary, presented by Mark Williams-Thomas, a consultant on the original Newsnight investigation, revealed claims by up to 10 women, including one aged under 14 at the time, that they had been molested or raped by Savile during the 1960s and 1970s. The announcement attracted national attention, and more reports and claims of abuse against him accumulated. The documentary was broadcast on 3 October. The next day, the Metropolitan Police said the Child Abuse Investigation Command would assess the allegations."]}, {"page": "Birmingham City University", "response": ["Notable graduates of the University and its predecessor institutions working in broadcasting include children's television presenter Kirsten O'Brien,  sports TV presenter Mary Rhodes, radio and TV presenters Fiona Phillips, Zo\u00eb Ball, Margherita Taylor and Phil Upton, investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas.

His comments were criticised by the NSPCC and Mark Williams-Thomas, the former child protection officer who had exposed Savile's crimes. Williams-Thomas accused Daniels of \"belittling\" the victims of Jimmy Savile in one of his blog posts.

The pair then presented a second documentary, Missing Without Trace, on 12 November 2013."]}, {"page": "Reactions to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann", "response": ["The disappearance provoked differing analyses by experts. Shortly after Madeleine went missing two former Scotland Yard commanders expressed the view that she had been abducted. Roy Ramm considered that it was a carefully planned kidnapping by someone who had been watching the child. John O'Connor was of the view that Madeleine had wandered out of the apartment on her own and was subsequently abducted. O'Connor opined that she was likely to be nearby and recommended a thorough search of surrounding occupied premises. This hypothesis was also supported by criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas who said, in May 2008, that he believed what happened was that Madeleine woke up, walked around the apartment, found the back patio door was insecure and wandered out. It was at this point that she was most likely abducted by an opportunistic predatory paedophile.", "A child protection specialist, Mark Williams-Thomas, who believes that Joana's and Madeleine's disappearances are related, said that the disappearance of two children unknown to each other, within a period of four years in a seven-mile radius, would be a huge coincidence, especially considering that Portugal is a small country with few abductions. Before Joana's disappearance, the previous first-degree murder of a child in the Algarve region was in November 1990 and involved a British girl, nine-year-old Rachel Charles, who was abducted and murdered in Albufeira. Her body was found three days later; a British mechanic, Michael Cook, a friend of the family, was arrested and convicted."]}, {"page": "Murder of Joana Cipriano", "response": ["A child protection specialist, Mark Williams-Thomas, who believes that Joana's and Madeleine's disappearances are related, said that the disappearance of two children unknown to each other, within a period of four years in a seven-mile radius, would be a huge coincidence, especially considering that Portugal is a small country with few abductions.

Detectives investigated whether Tobin was responsible but could never prove his involvement. At the time of the disappearance, Tobin owned the property 22 Windlesham Road in Brighton; the house and its garden have never been searched for remains. Operation Anagram had ordered the search of two houses that Tobin had owned in Brighton in relation to the search for Kay, but had not ordered the search of the Windlesham Road property. Former police officer and investigator Mark Williams-Thomas stated in a documentary in 2018, part of his The Investigator: A British Crime Story series, that he believes the body of Kay is still buried in the garden of the property.", "Apparently related to the case of Louise Kay was the murder of 22-year-old Jessie Earl in 1980, a murder that was one of those reinvestigated by Operation Anagram. Earl had also disappeared from Eastbourne, and her skeletonised body was found in 1989 concealed in dense shrubland on Beachy Head, the same place Louise Kay had vanished from in 1988. Her own bra had been tied around her hands to restrain her. As with Kay, Tobin was living in the area at the time of her murder. In 2012, criminologist David Wilson produced a documentary as part of his Killers Behind Bars: The Untold Story series, in which he made his case to support the theory that Earl was a likely victim of Tobin. In Mark Williams-Thomas's 2018 documentary on Louise Kay, he also supported the theory that Tobin could be responsible for Earl's death after linking her case to Kay's disappearance.", "* 14 December 1991: Nicola Payne. 18-year-old mother of one Payne disappeared while walking to her parents' house in Coventry. In 2010 there was media speculation that police were investigating Tobin for Payne's murder. Tobin was known to have spent time in Coventry in the early 90s when hiding with a religious sect while on the run from police. Investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas, who has been heavily involved in the Payne case, included Payne on a list of unsolved murders that he thought Tobin could not be ruled out from in a 2018 episode of his documentary series The Investigator: A British Crime Story, but subsequently stated that he does not believe that Tobin was responsible for her murder.", "* 26 February 1980: Elizabeth McCabe. 20-year-old McCabe was found strangled to death in Templeton Woods, Dundee. Her murder was included on a list of cases that investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas believed Tobin could not be ruled out from on a 2018 episode of his documentary series The Investigator: A British Crime Story. Her case, and that of 18-year-old Carol Lannen who was found dead only 150 yards from McCabe a year before, was investigated by police as part of an investigation into murders committed by Angus Sinclair.", "* 30 July 1992: Helen Gorrie. 15-year-old Gorrie left her house at night to meet a man called John and was later found murdered in a nearby community centre in Horndean. She had been strangled and smothered with her own clothing. Her murder was included on Mark Williams-Thomas's list of cases he felt Tobin could not be ruled out from in his 2018 documentary. A man, John Corcoran, was jailed for her murder in 1999 after his business card was found in Gorrie's room, but his conviction was overturned in 2003. After his acquittal, police said they had no plans to re-open the murder investigation."]}, {"page": "List of Peabody Award winners (2010\u20132019)", "response": ["|Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, researched and presented by Mark Williams-Thomas"]}, {"page": "Pierrepont School, Frensham", "response": ["*Mark Williams-Thomas, Investigative TV reporter"]}, {"page": "Exposure (British TV series)", "response": ["Mark Williams-Thomas investigates", "Former police officer Mark Williams-Thomas investigates claims of sexual abuse of underage girls against the charity fundraiser and television presenter Jimmy Savile.

Following the broadcast, many other people came forward to make allegations about Savile's conduct towards young people, including sexual abuse that had taken place on BBC premises and in hospitals to which Savile had access."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal", "response": ["Immediately after Savile's death, Meirion Jones and Liz Mackean from the BBC programme Newsnight began to investigate reports that he had sexually abused children. They interviewed one alleged victim on camera and talked to a number of others who were willing to be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School, the BBC, and Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The former headmistress of Duncroft was Jones' own aunt. The Newsnight team, which included former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, also found out about a 2009 Surrey Police investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the allegations against Savile were made public in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean had assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and Newsnight had been in a position to break the story in 2011.", "An ITV documentary, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, was broadcast on 3 October 2012.
