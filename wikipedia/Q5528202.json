It was alleged that, of the money donated from Libya, Scargill took \u00a329,000 for his own bridging loan and \u00a325,000 for his home in Yorkshire, but gave only \u00a310,000 to the striking Nottinghamshire miners. In addition, it was alleged that he had taken \u00a31,000,000 of cash donated by the Soviet Union for the Welsh miners and placed it in a Dublin bank account for the \"International Miners' Organisation\", where it stayed until a year after the strike had finished. There was much criticism of Scargill within the NUM from the Welsh and Scottish areas, who briefly considered splitting from the NUM. An internal NUM report by Gavin Lightman QC found that Scargill had used some of the Libyan money to pay for improvements to his bungalow but not to pay off his mortgage (as had been alleged), and stated that Scargill's failure to make a full report on the Soviet money donated for the Welsh miners was \"a remarkable breach of duty\" and that he should repay the money back to the NUM.
