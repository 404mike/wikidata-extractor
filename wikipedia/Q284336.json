Sciama proposed the addition of an acceleration dependent term to the Newtonian gravitation equation. Sciama's acceleration dependent term was F = G \\frac{m_A m_B \\bf a}{rc^2}\\  where r is the distance between the particles, G is the gravitational constant, a is the relative acceleration and c represents the speed of light in vacuum. Sciama referred to the effect of the acceleration dependent term as Inertial Induction."]}, {"page": "Frank J.

Sciama (1926\u20131999): British physicist who played a major role in developing British physics after the Second World War. His most significant work was in general relativity, with and without quantum theory, and black holes. He helped revitalize the classical relativistic alternative to general relativity known as Einstein-Cartan gravity. He is considered one of the fathers of modern cosmology."]}, {"page": "Adrian Melott", "response": ["He became active in the antiwar and educational movements of the 60's, and was drawn into the Unitarian ministry. He attended Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley, California and was minister in Tampa, Florida for 7 years. During this time he continued his interest in physics. In 1977 he entered the physics program at the University of Texas at Austin where he met and quickly decided to work with noted cosmologist Dennis W. Sciama. He was among one of three groups who had initiated the numerical simulation of the formation of structure in a Universe dominated by dark matter."]}]}}
