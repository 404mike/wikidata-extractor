In 1996, he also became Chairman of the Rugby League International Board which at the time, was at odds with the Australian Rugby League. Lindsay left the RFL to become the Chief Executive of the newly formed Super League (Europe) Ltd. in February 2008. This followed an acrimonious period and in-fighting within the league divisions including an attempt to unseat the Chairman of the RFL, Sir Rodney Walker. Relations between Lindsay and Sir Rodney had deteriorated but the leading clubs wanted Lindsay to assume control of the newly formed Super League. Lindsay immediately secured a new lucrative TV contract exclusively for Super League. He remained at Super League until he voluntarily retired at the end of 1999. "]}]}}
