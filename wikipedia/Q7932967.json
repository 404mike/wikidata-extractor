He shared the fannish Epicentre flat in London with Ken Bulmer (with whom he collaborated on some sf novels). He was the first winner of the TransAtlantic Fan Fund (TAFF) in 1954, but was unable to take the trip. He was active in running conventions, including the 1957 Worldcon, Loncon I. In 1958 he helped inspire the formation of the British Science Fiction Association. He dropped almost all contact with fans in 1960 after his wife Joy left him for fellow fan Sandy Sanderson, and did not return to fandom until 1982. He was Fan Guest of Honour at the 1995 Worldcon, Intersection. In his later years he remained active in fandom, maintaining an extensive library of Science Fiction fanzines, co-editing the fanzine Pulp and contributing to work documenting UK fannish history. He died on 29 November 1998 from pneumonia following a long illness. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Science fiction fandom", "response": ["* Vin\u00a2 Clarke"]}, {"page": "List of Worldcons", "response": ["| Samuel R.

William F. Temple was involved as an editorial consultant and also assisted with editing the manuscripts.Philip Harbottle, \"Introduction\", in Bounds, Best of Sydney J. Bounds, Vol. 1, p.\u00a012. Hamilton provided all the financing, but he had to wait for the money to come in from each issue before he could afford to produce the next. In addition, Crownpoint only intermittently had enough spare capacity to print Nebula, so the first few issues appeared on an erratic schedule.  After a dozen issues, the conflicts led to Hamilton moving Nebula to a printing firm based in Dublin, and breaking the connection with Crownpoint.  He was then able to publish on a slightly more regular schedule, although the planned bi-monthly issues were still sometimes delayed. Hamilton paid 21 shillings (\u00a31.05) per thousand words, the equivalent of three-tenths of a cent per word; this was a low rate compared to the American market, but was marginally better than the contemporary British magazine Authentic Science Fiction, which paid \u00a31 per thousand words.Ashley, History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 3, pp.\u00a068\u201371 Hamilton offered a bonus of \u00a32 or \u00a35 to the story that turned out to be the readers' favourite in each issue, which helped attract writers; and he later increased the rates, paying as much as 2d (0.8p, or 2.3 cents) per word for well-known authors.  This was higher than the best UK markets, such as New Worlds, and was close to the rates paid by the top magazines in the US at that time. Both the high rates of pay and Hamilton's willingness to work with new authors were designed to encourage writers to submit their work to Nebula before trying the other magazines.Philip Harbottle, \"Remembering Phil High\", in Fantasy Adventures 13, p.\u00a0122."]}, {"page": "List of Worldcon Guests of Honor", "response": ["| Vin\u00a2 Clarke"]}]}}
