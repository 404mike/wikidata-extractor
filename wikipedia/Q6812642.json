Certain critics welcomed Burke's transition into dance and house music. AllMusic editor Matt Collar awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, immediately noticing her musical shift from pop and R&B to a \"club-oriented sound\". He compared a few tracks to the work of Burke's mother and former Soul II Soul vocalist Melissa Bell, and also noted American singers Lady Gaga, Robin S., Janet Jackson, and AUstralian singer Kylie Minogue. He highlighted the title track, \"Love You That Much\" and \"Daylight Robbery\" as the album's key tracks, and also listed them, alongside \"Elephant\", as some of her career highlights. Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian, commented that \"The album falls back on the Auto-Tuned pyrotechnics and clinical club-pop that has currently turned the singles chart into a featureless wasteland, Burke follows a well-travelled road, losing her likable personality en route.\" Simon Gage from Daily Express agreed, writing: \"It seems to be very little charisma on this new album of driving pop/dance that she insists has an emotional underpinning.\""]}]}}
