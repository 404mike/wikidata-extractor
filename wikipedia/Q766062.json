In the Introduction to \"Ceylon\" Tennent writes \"Respecting the Physical Geography and Natural History of the colony, I found an equal want of reliable information; and every work that even touched on the subject was pervaded by the misapprehension which I have collected evidence to correct; that Ceylon is but a fragment of the great Indian continent dissevered by some local convulsion; and that the zoology and botany of the island are identical with those of the mainland. Thus for almost every particular and fact, whether physical or historical, I have been to a great extent thrown on my own researches; and obliged to seek for information in original sources, and in French and English versions of Oriental authorities. The results of my investigations are embodied in the following pages; and it only remains for me to express, in terms however inadequate, my obligations to the literary and scientific friends by whose aid I have been enabled to pursue my inquiries\". Collaborators resident in Ceylon include, especially the Belfast born naturalist Robert Templeton and like Tennent a  fellow Member of the Belfast Natural History Society who is thanked thus for his cordial assistance in numerous departments; but above all in relation to the physical geography and natural history of the island. Here his scientific knowledge, successfully cultivated during a residence of nearly twelve years in Ceylon, and his intimate familiarity with its zoology and productions, rendered his co-operation invaluable. Others were  Dr. Cameron, of the Army Medical Staff (as was Templeton), Dr. Davy \"when connected with the medical staff of the army from 1816 to 1820\", William Ferguson, Esq., employed by the Survey Department of the Civil Service in Ceylon and a botanist, George Gardner and  George Henry Kendrick Thwaites of  the Botanic Gardens in Peradeniya, Edward Frederick Kelaart  Edgar Leopold Layard as well as from officers of the Ceylon Civil Service; the Hon. Gerald  C. Talbot, Mr. C.E. Buller, Mr. Mercer, Mr. Morris, Mr. Whiting, Major Skinner, and Mr. Mitford and  Members of the  Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society."]}]}}
