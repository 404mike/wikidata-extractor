He was a presenter on American and British television and for the BBC's Panorama programme and gained an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales for the programme in 1995. Much heralded at the time, it was later determined that he used forgery and deception to gain the interview.Bashir worked for the BBC from 1986 until 1999 on programmes including Panorama before joining ITV. He presented the 2003 ITV documentary about Michael Jackson. From 2004 to 2016, he worked in New York, first as an anchor for ABC's Nightline and then as a political commentator for MSNBC, hosting his own programme, Martin Bashir, and a correspondent for NBC's Dateline NBC. He resigned from his position at MSNBC in December 2013 after making \"ill-judged\" comments about the former Governor of Alaska and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. In 2016, he returned to the BBC as religious affairs correspondent.\nIn 2020, the BBC's director general Tim Davie apologised to the brother of the princess, Earl Spencer, for Bashir's use of faked bank statements to secure his 1995 Panorama interview with the Princess of Wales, Spencer's sister. Former Justice of the Supreme Court Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue. Lord Dyson's inquiry concluded Bashir had commissioned fake statements to deceive Earl Spencer in order to gain access to Diana and in so doing had \"acted inappropriately and in serious breach of the 1993 edition of the Producers\u2019 Guidelines on straight dealing.\" Bashir resigned from the BBC in May 2021, citing health reasons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 19", "response": ["*  1963   \u2013 Martin Bashir, English journalist"]}, {"page": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["Journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama.

", "The interview proved to be the tipping point. On 20 December, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had sent letters to Charles and Diana, advising them to divorce. The Queen's move was backed by the Prime Minister and by senior Privy Counsellors, and, according to the BBC, was decided after two weeks of talks. Charles formally agreed to the divorce in a written statement soon after. In February 1996, Diana announced her agreement after negotiations with Charles and representatives of the Queen, irritating Buckingham Palace by issuing her own announcement of the divorce agreement and its terms. In July 1996, the couple agreed on the terms of their divorce. This followed shortly after Diana's accusation that Charles's personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke had aborted his child, after which Legge-Bourke instructed her attorney Peter Carter-Ruck to demand an apology. Diana's private secretary Patrick Jephson resigned shortly before the story broke, later writing that she had \"exulted in accusing Legge-Bourke of having had an abortion\".
