Moore was involved in a \"suffrage society\", a chapter of the National College Equal Suffrage League, and she was present at most of their events. Notably, Moore wrote in her personal letters to her family that she attended lectures at Bryn Mawr by the well-known feminist Jane Addams and the British suffragette Anne Cobden-Sanderson. Of the American suffragist Anna Howard Shaw, she wrote: \"Miss Shaw spoke last night on the Modern Democratic ideal. I couldn't say how she delighted me.
