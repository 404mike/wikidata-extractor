On 21 July 2005, he moved back to Norway and joined Fredrikstad F.K. on a free transfer, where he played on a match-by-match basis. He played three matches for Fredrikstad, including an emotional encounter with his former club Viking, before English club Charlton Athletic signed him on a two-year deal on 8 August 2005 following an injury to their goalkeeper Dean Kiely. Initially second choice goalkeeper behind Stephan Andersen, Myhre established himself as Charlton's starting goalkeeper in December 2005. Through the rest of the season, Myhre kept 10 clean sheets, and he played more than ten hours without conceding a home goal at The Valley.

In the second round of the League Cup match against Gillingham, Ashdown was at fault when he made two mistakes, including scoring an own goal, in a 3\u20132 loss, eliminating the club from the tournament. Despite this, he remained as Portsmouth's first choice goalkeeper for the rest of the year, though his mistakes continued along the way. This last until Ashdown suffered an injury while warming up prior to a match against Fulham on 1 January 2006.

In Charlton's first season back in the Premiership, Todd scored his first and what turned out to be only Charlton goal against Leicester City in April 2001. However, a training fracas with a then unnamed player (who was later revealed to be Dean Kiely), meant that he was on a knife-edge at the club.

At the end of his apprenticeship, Brown was offered a one-year professional contract with Addicks for the 2000\u201301 season. However, he struggled to make an impact on the squad with four other senior goalkeepers in the team. As so he entered into talks with club manager Alan Curbishley who believed that he wouldn't continually improve as a player and thus offered to help him find a new club. Concerned about his footballing future, Brown looked for jobs elsewhere. After being recommended by Dean Kiely to Sheffield United's assistant manager Kevin Blackwell, Brown earned a trial at Bramall Lane. With the club he then featured in a friendly game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, Brown eventually wasn't offered a contract as Warnock was looking for a more experienced alternative to first choice goalkeeper Simon Tracey."]}]}}
