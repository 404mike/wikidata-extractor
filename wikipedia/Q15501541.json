It is next to the fire station at Preston Circus and occupies the site of a 19th-century brewery.  The architects were Clayton & Black. There are some Classical and Palladian touches on the elaborately decorated fa\u00e7ade, notably in the four-arch colonnade, but the overall style is Baroque.  The symmetrical front elevation has full-height rusticated pilasters on the two end bays, giving them the appearance of towers. The \"monumental\" Savoy Cinema (1930, by William Glen) just behind the seafront was later converted into a casino.  The 3,000-capacity building has a tall and prominent entrance in a free Art Deco style with some Classical touches. Its Sussex bricks were given a white glaze, and the building was nicknamed \"the white whale\".  \"The most impressive of Brighton's interwar cinemas\", though, was the Regent\u2014designed in 1921 by Robert Atkinson and replaced in 1974 by a commercial development. It was Classical-style inside and out (the interior was the work of Walpole Champneys) and had a winter garden just below the roof. Its replacement was the Odeon Kingswest, converted in 1973 from the Russell Diplock Associates-designed Brighton Top Rank Centre of 1965.  The \"intrusively aggressive\" Brutalist structure has no windows and a low, \"emphatically horizontal\" appearance, but its jagged roofline of bronze-coated aluminium shapes give it prominence on its corner site.  \"Hove's most opulent cinema\" (and its only purpose-built one) was the Granada (1933) at Portland Road in the Aldrington area.  F.E. Bromige designed the Art Deco building, whose \"striking angular tower\" and corner site made it a landmark.  The Art Deco theme continued inside.  Closure came in 1974 and the building became a bingo hall. It was demolished in 2012 in favour of a mixed-use development. Another 1930s cinema that became a bingo hall in the 1970s and later closed is the Astoria Theatre on Gloucester Place in Brighton.  Demolition was authorised in 2012, although as it was a Grade II-listed building the final decision lay with national government. Demolition, again for a mixed-use development, began in April 2018.

It has occupied its large corner site at the junction of Church Street and New Road in North Laine since William Porden built it for the Prince Regent in 1804\u201308.  Borough Surveyor Philip Lockwood converted the buildings into an entertainment complex in 1867\u201373, then the next Surveyor Francis May and theatre architect Robert Atkinson did more work in 1901\u201302 and 1934 respectively.  Atkinson's additions included the theatre, which faces New Road.  All of these schemes retained the Indian/Islamic architectural influences of Porden's work.  Atkinson gave the concert hall an Art Deco interior, while May's interior work was \"of an eclectic Neo-Jacobean kind\". Also on New Road is the Theatre Royal, another early-19th-century building remodelled several times subsequently.  Charles J. Phipps extended the theatre in 1866, and Clayton & Black gave the building its present appearance in 1894.  Their work includes a colonnade of cast iron columns of the Corinthian order, an exterior of \"vivid red brick\" and a series of dome-topped turrets on the roofline.
