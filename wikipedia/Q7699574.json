A single blob was now used: it featured a larger and plainer 'C' letter and was turned into a three-dimensional object, which would zoom around a screen often accompanied by a ball from which many arrows could point and some crystal lines were flying about. The idents had also the CBBC stars in the purple background with various floating objects (such as the cash registers for Kerching!, the heart balloons for Tracy Beaker or the flying birds for Raven) inside the CBBC logo, including Dani Harmer, James Mackenzie, Nev the Bear, Basil Brush, Devon Anderson, Tendayi Jembere, Jamie Sweeney, Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood. This style was changed so that the end screen changed to a single shot of the bug with the programme name below, and the DOG was also updated. In-vision for the channel continued to be used, however, it was used less and less: CBBC moved out of TC9 in December 2006 to TC12, where the presenter would just stand in front of a bluescreen while only a fixed camera is used."]}, {"page": "Tendayi", "response": ["* Tendayi Jembere, British actor"]}, {"page": "Jembere", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tendayi Jembere"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bulawayo", "response": ["* Tendayi Jembere, actor"]}]}}
