He made his debut for Albion a day later in the 3\u20130 defeat against Celtic in the fourth round tie of the Scottish Cup at Celtic Park. He came on as a second-half substitute for David McKenna. He made his first start a week after against Livingston, but after the match he then faced a six-week absence through fatigue and lack of fitness. His first match back on 1 March saw him come off the bench to score a consolation in the last minute and his first professional goal away at Morton which ended in a 2\u20131 defeat. He stayed with Stirling until the end of the campaign and also scored goals against Livingston and St Johnstone, but these goals weren't enough to keep Albion up and they were relegated after finishing bottom of the table."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 St Mirren F.C. season", "response": ["| David McKenna || Stirling Albion || Free"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Scottish Second Division", "response": ["|  David McKenna"]}, {"page": "David McKenna", "response": ["David McKenna may refer to:", "*David McKenna (footballer) (born 1986), Scottish footballer", "*David McKenna (writer) (born 1968), American screenwriter and producer", "*David McKenna (politician) (?\u20132014), Canadian optometrist, businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Brechin City F.C. season", "response": ["| David McKenna"]}, {"page": "List of Stirling Albion F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Martin GrehanDavid McKenna||12"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Brechin City F.C. season", "response": ["|||FW||David McKenna"]}]}}
