He made 47 League One appearances before signing for Championship club Birmingham City in August 2016. After three seasons with Birmingham, he moved to Southampton in July 2019.\nAdams represented his native England at under-20 level in 2015. He qualifies for Scotland by descent and made his senior debut in 2021. At UEFA Euro 2020 he became the first non-white player to play for Scotland at the finals of a major tournament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "response": ["He remained a regular selection despite missing chances, and his 11th goal of the season, on 4 February 2018 at home to Fulham, gave Birmingham their first win under the management of Zola, who praised Jutkiewicz's work-rate and importance to the team even when he was not himself scoring. His next goal, some five weeks later, was a scrappy late equaliser away to Cardiff City; his total of 12 made him the team's top scorer for the season. Zola left the club with three matches left in the season, replaced by Harry Redknapp with the remit of keeping Birmingham in the division. Needing to win the last two matches of the season to avoid relegation, they did so despite Jutkiewicz's missed penalty against Huddersfield; in the final fixture, away to Bristol City, he provided the pass from which Che Adams ran through to score the winning goal."]}]}}
