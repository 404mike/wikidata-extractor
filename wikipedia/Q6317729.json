The club spent some serious money in pre-season in order to bolster their strike force, as they hoped to clinch the elusive Conference title at last. The huge sum of nearly \u00a3300,000 was spent on new players, including Duane Darby, a \u00a3100,000 purchase from Notts County and Justin Jackson from Morecambe, for whom \u00a3180,000 was paid. Jackson's fee was an unprecedented amount of money paid between two non-league clubs. The brand new Dr. Martens Sports and Exhibition Centre was opened in early summer, containing gymnasium, management offices and recreational facilities amongst other offerings. With promotion being an absolute must, a great start soon tailed off and Diamonds trailed Yeovil Town at Christmas time by a huge margin.  However, despite some fans calling for Brian Talbot's head, Max Griggs' faith would be rewarded. A run of just one defeat from the remaining 23 matches saw the deficit clawed back. The club eventually finished six points ahead of their title rivals, securing promotion into Football League Division Three with a 2\u20131 win at Chester City."]}, {"page": "List of Woking F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Justin Jackson"]}, {"page": "Justin Jackson", "response": ["Justin Jackson may refer to:", "*Justin Jackson (American football) (born 1996), American football player", "*Justin Jackson (basketball, born 1990), American basketball player who went to college at Cincinnati", "*Justin Jackson (basketball, born 1995), American basketball player in the NBA who went to college at North Carolina", "*Justin Jackson (basketball, born 1997), Canadian basketball player who went to college at Maryland", "*Justin Jackson (footballer) (born 1974), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Morecambe F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Justin Jackson"]}]}}
