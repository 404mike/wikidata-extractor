He scored his first goal for United in the same season, and in doing so became the first black player to score for the club.Moses was a key midfielder for United during the 1980s, but suffered a succession of serious injuries. He missed the FA Cup final triumphs of 1983 due to suspension and 1985 due to injury, and played his last game for the club in the 1987\u201388 season.\nHe was on the verge of being capped for the England team in 1985 before an injury ruled him out of action, causing him to miss most of the 1985\u201386 season. He also faced competition from Norman Whiteside for a place in central midfield, after Whiteside was converted from a striker to a midfielder.\nInjuries had gradually forced him out of the team and he finally announced his retirement from playing in the 1988\u201389 season at the age of just 28.\nIn 2000, Moses was working as a property dealer in Alkrington, Greater Manchester, and in his spare time, coaching the Manchester Warriors under-20 inline skating side, which had just won the GB Inline Hockey League and \"every other trophy going\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 14", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 Remi Moses, English footballer and coach"]}, {"page": "Bryan Robson", "response": ["Ron Atkinson left to take over at Manchester United in June 1981, and speculation mounted that Robson would either follow him to United or join Bob Paisley's Liverpool.

Early in the season he had paid a national record \u00a31.5 million for Bryan Robson from his old club West Bromwich Albion, and shortly afterwards also added midfielder Remi Moses (also from West Bromwich Albion) and Arsenal striker Frank Stapleton to his ranks. He also gave a debut to promising young forward Norman Whiteside in April 1982, just before the player's 17th birthday."]}, {"page": "Ronnie Allen", "response": ["He returned to the Hawthorns as manager again in July 1981, succeeding Ron Atkinson \u2013 who had just moved to Manchester United. Two of Albion's finest players, Remi Moses and Bryan Robson, soon joined Atkinson at Old Trafford and this had a negative effect on Albion's previously good league fortunes. He signed Steve MacKenzie, Andy King, Martin Jol, and Romeo Zondervan; none of whom would prove particularly effective. Albion did well in the cup competitions, reaching the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup, although they suffered an early exit from the UEFA Cup. But Allen was unable to put together a good run of form in the First Division, and Albion only stayed up after winning their final game of the season. He then ended his managerial career in May 1982, choosing instead to work as the club's general manager. He stepped down from this post in June 1983, though continued to coach and scout for the club during his retirement, until 1996. He even played in a testimonial match at Cheltenham in 1995, at the age of 66."]}, {"page": "Mark Hughes", "response": ["When Hughes made his United debut, the club's forward partnership consisted of 27-year-old Irishman Frank Stapleton and 18-year-old Norman Whiteside from Northern Ireland, and breaking up that partnership would not be an easy challenge for Hughes. But Hughes quickly broke into the first team, partnering Frank Stapleton in attack while Norman Whiteside was switched to midfield to partner Ray Wilkins and stand in for the injury prone Remi Moses. The departure of Wilkins to Milan at the end of the season saw manager Ron Atkinson decide to stick to using Whiteside in the centre of midfield, enabling Hughes to keep his place in the first team ahead of new signing Alan Brazil, and he was rewarded handsomely as he scored 25 goals in 55 matches across all competitions as United achieved an FA Cup final victory over Everton. They also finished fourth in the league."]}, {"page": "Weymouth F.C.", "response": ["On 21 October 1987, Manchester United came to play against Weymouth on the night of the stadium unveiling by Ron Greenwood.

However, injury to midfielder Remi Moses left an opening at the centre of the field, and Whiteside proved to be a revelation in the role with his intelligent play and positioning skills, and stayed in midfield for the rest of manager Ron Atkinson's time at the club. He formed a solid partnership with Bryan Robson, despite the two being similarly attacking players, and United lost just one of their first 15 games with this new midfield partnership in operation. Whiteside scored the only hat-trick of his professional career in a 4\u20132 home win over West Ham United on 9 March 1985, in the FA Cup quarter-finals; it was a 'perfect hat-trick' in that he scored once with each foot and once with his head. He went on to score the winning goal in the 1985 FA Cup Final, curling a shot in from the right hand side in the 20th minute of extra time, to give ten-man United victory over Everton, and Whiteside his second FA Cup winner's medal. The goal required vision, timing, and precise shooting; and The Guardian praised his \"cool footballing brain\" and \"clever concealment of the shot\". After this success he negotiated a new contract of \u00a360,000 a year."]}, {"page": "Jesper Olsen", "response": ["During October 1986, Olsen had a training ground bust-up with midfield colleague Remi Moses and by the end of the month he was put on the transfer list by manager Ron Atkinson. However, Atkinson was sacked as manager a week later due to United's dismal start to the season, and his successor Alex Ferguson took Olsen off the transfer list and he would stay at Old Trafford for two more years, even passing up the chance to sign John Barnes from Watford in the summer of 1987 due to his faith in Olsen."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.

Norman Whiteside soon broke through the youth ranks and was a key first team player at age 17, while striker Frank Stapleton managed a steady supply of goals after his acquisition from Arsenal. Atkinson also retained a number of players from the Sexton era, namely midfielder Ray Wilkins.
