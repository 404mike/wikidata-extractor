Following commercial investigation of the western Victorian coast, it was named after John Griffiths, an entrepreneur and merchant from Launceston in northern Tasmania, who figures prominently in the early history of the area. From the mid-1830s until 1843 the island served as a base for a bay whaling station for southern right whales, until the supply of whales was exhausted and the industry went into terminal decline. Some shipbuilding also took place during the 1840s. The abandoned whaling station buildings were later used until 1854 by Flora Dunlop, widow of Victorian politician Alexander Dunlop, as a 'mission' for young Aborigines. Because of its historic and archaeological significance, the island has been listed on the Victorian Heritage Register (H1659)."]}, {"page": "Eumeralla Wars", "response": ["Coastal Gunditjmara people first came into regular contact with British colonisers in the early 1830s when whalers such as William Dutton, John Griffiths and the Henty brothers started to establish whaling stations at Portland Bay."]}, {"page": "Africaine (1832 ship)", "response": ["In 1838 her owner became John Griffiths et al., of Launceston.

Campbell joined other whaling captains such as John and Charles Mills, William Dutton, and Captain John Griffiths in utilising Portland Bay as a base for whaling operations in this area.", "In 1837, Campbell decided to construct a whaling station at Port Fairy to the east of Portland Bay. Houses were soon built on Griffiths Island just off the coast of the port. This whaling establishment proved successful with Captain Campbell securing 220 tons of oil and 13 tons of whalebone in the first season. Campbell, in conjunction with John Griffiths and Michael Connolly, set up a farming and whaling company and sheep were transported into Port Fairy. A sheep station known as \"The Farm\" was formed, which afterwards became the Farnham Estate. Aboriginal people in the area being dispossessed of their land took to taking large amounts of these sheep and the colonists formed a punitive expedition under Mr McDonald, and punished them severely. Campbell had an Aboriginal servant whom he named \"Sou-wester\".", "He captained various vessels trading between the ports of Sydney, Launceston, Port Fairy, and Melbourne. His business partner John Griffiths soon afterwards re-established the whaling station at Port Fairy again, and Captain Campbell joined in the enterprise. In 1844, while living there, he married his wife, Mary Ann Coulson (16 June 1817 - 17 Sept 1902). During the next three years Captain Campbell continued whaling and trading out of Port Fairy. By the year 1847, however, whaling had ceased to be profitable and Campbell moved into the business of salvaging and on-selling ships. He also built a flour mill at Rosebrook not far from Port Fairy."]}]}}
