There is, however, one very clear piece of evidence pointing to Dublin as his place of origin: he dedicated the song \"From Silent Night\" to 'my loving countryman Mr. John Forster the younger, merchant of Dublin in Ireland'.

Historians still debate a precise definition of Puritanism. Originally, Puritan was a pejorative term characterizing certain Protestant groups as extremist. Thomas Fuller, in his Church History, dates the first use of the word to 1564. Archbishop Matthew Parker of that time used it and precisian with a sense similar to the modern stickler. Puritans, then, were distinguished for being \"more intensely protestant than their protestant neighbors or even the Church of England\". As a term of abuse, Puritan was not used by Puritans themselves. Those referred to as Puritan called themselves terms such as \"the godly\", \"saints\", \"professors\", or \"God's children\"."]}, {"page": "Samuel Butler (poet)", "response": ["Butler was brought up in the household of Sir William Russell of Strensham and became his clerk. \"When just a Boy he would make observations and reflections on every Thing one sayd or did, and censure it to be either well or ill.

In early youth he was a servant to the Countess of Kent. Through Lady Kent he met her steward, the jurist John Selden who influenced his later writings.  He also tried his hand at painting but was reportedly not very good at it; one of his editors reporting that \"his pictures served to stop windows and save the tax\" (on window glass). Conversely, John Aubrey who knew Butler quite well enough to be one of his pallbearers, wrote that \"He was thinking once to have made painting his Profession.

According to the churchman and historian Thomas Fuller (1608\u201361), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in Lincoln's Inn. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Ben Jonson went to the Netherlands and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Francis Vere (1560\u20131609) in Flanders.", "Thomas Fuller relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the Mermaid Tavern; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (Every Man in His Humour and Sejanus His Fall) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated."]}, {"page": "Kett's Rebellion", "response": ["The rising was discussed by Sir John Cheke in The hurt of sedicion howe greueous it is to a commune welth, (1549).John Cheke, The hurt of sedicion howe greueous it is to a commune welth, (London: Iohn Daye and Wylliam Seres, 1549), ESTC S107791. The only known surviving eye-witness account of the rebellion, a manuscript by Nicholas Sotherton, son of a Norwich mayor, probably Nicholas Sotherton (d.1540), is hostile towards the rebels.

The French soldier Philippe de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res refers to Edward as the greatest of the \"black boars\" \u2013 those aggressors who had done so much to disrupt relations within Christendom. Other French writers made similar associations, and Peter Hoskins reports that an oral tradition of L'Homme Noir, who had passed by with an army, survived in southern France until recent years. In Shakespeare's Henry V, the King of France alludes to \"that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales\". John Speed reported in 1611 that the Black Prince was so named \"not of his colour, but of his dreaded Acts in battell\"; a comment echoed in 1642 by Thomas Fuller, who wrote that he was named \"from his dreaded acts and not from his complexion\". Joshua Barnes claimed in 1688 that it was from the time of the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy that \"the French began to call [him] Le Neoir, or the Black-Prince\", appearing to cite a record of 2 Richard II (i.e. 1378\u20139); but his reference is insufficiently precise to be traceable.

Wood wrote that the Anatomy, as \"a Book so full of variety of reading\", prompted hack authors to borrow shamelessly from the work. Some authors, \"who have lost their time and are put to a push for invention\" poached his numerous classical quotations, in a show of erudition. In the 18th century, George Steevens retrospectively noted it as \"a book once the favourite of the learned and witty, and a source of surreptitious learning\". Certainly, scholars copied and emulated the Anatomy to their own ends: William Vaughan repurposed Burton's critique of court patronage towards an anti-Catholic end in The Golden Fleece (1626); Nathanael Carpenter imitated Burton's intimate articulation of his own melancholy and defence of scholarship for his Geography delineated forth (1625); and Richard Whitlock, in his Zootomia (1654), plagiarised Burton's defence of scholarship wholesale in defending the university from contemporary Puritan attacks. For the dramatists such as John Ford, Burton's treatise \"was virtually an authoritative psychiatric textbook\", used as a reference work for their depictions of melancholy. Richard Holdsworth, when Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1637\u201343), recommended it as a comprehensive digest to \"serve for [the] delight and ornament\" of young gentlemen, bestowing that learning expected of a gentleman rather than that of a serious scholar.

Alexander Pope (1688\u20131744) owned a copy of Rogers' reprint of Crowley's edition of Piers Plowman with the Crede appended, and Isaac D'Israeli (1766\u20131848) wrote in his Amenities of Literature that Pope had \"very carefully analyzed the whole\" of the latter text.

A Puritan by upbringing, in 1637 Owen was driven from Oxford by Laud's new statutes, and became chaplain and tutor in the family of Sir Robert Dormer and then in that of Lord Lovelace. At the outbreak of the English Civil War he sided with the parliament, and thus lost both his place and the prospects of succeeding to his Welsh Royalist uncle's fortune. For a while he lived in Charterhouse Yard, troubled by religious questions.  His doubts were removed by a sermon preached by a stranger in the church of St Mary Aldermanbury where he had gone intending to hear Edmund Calamy the Elder. Owen's first publication, The Display of Arminianism (synergism) (1642), was a spirited defence of Calvinism (monergism). It was dedicated to the committee of religion, and gained him the living of Fordham in Essex, from which a \"scandalous minister\" had been ejected.
