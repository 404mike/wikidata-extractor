He had requested to be transferred to an infantry regiment where one was likely to see action, was then a Lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Munster Fusiliers, British 1st Division during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.:\n\n\"On 25 June 1916 near Colonne, France, Lieutenant Henry-Batten-Pooll was in command of a raiding party when, on entering the enemy's lines he was severely wounded by a bomb which broke and mutilated all the fingers of his right hand. In spite of this he continued to direct operations with unflinching courage. Half an hour later during the withdrawal, while personally assisting in the rescue of other wounded men, he received two further wounds, but refusing assistance, he walked to within 100 yards of our lines when he fainted and was carried in by the covering party.\"\nHe later achieved the rank of captain.\nHis Victoria Cross is in the collections of the National Army Museum, Chelsea, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| Arthur Batten-Pooll || British Army || 1916 || First World War || Colonne"]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 19th century", "response": ["* Arthur Batten-Pooll (1891\u20131971), First World War soldier who was awarded the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Royal Munster Fusiliers", "response": ["In May, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers received many of the personnel from the disbanded 9th Royal Munster Fusiliers, bringing it up to strength for the summer campaign. The battalions' first noteworthy operation was the carefully planned Li\u00e9vin raid on 25 June. It was during this action that Lieutenant Arthur Batten-Pooll would win the regiment's second Victoria Cross, although losses were heavy for the battalion with 5 officers and 60 other ranks killed or wounded.Staunton, pp.35\u201336 The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred with its division down to the Somme sector in July for the opening of the Battle of the Somme, entering the lines on 14 July and capturing its objectives two days later. The battalion repulsed the German counterattack on 18 July, with an officer and 26 men killed, 127 wounded and 50 gassed. The Munsters were in reserve until 20 August, when they entered the lines once again for steady fighting but ran into heavy off-target and ineffective British artillery bombardment, killing 4 officers and 29 other ranks. A continual toll of casualties made September a costly month for the battalion. After a month's break in October, the 2 Royal Munster Fusiliers returned to the Somme for maintenance duties, then went into the mud filled front-line trenches from 27 November onwards, with a steady stream of casualties from frostbite and raids continuing to the end of December. Throughout the Somme campaign the 2RMF retained its local and Irish character.Staunton, pp.36\u201340", "*Arthur Batten-Pooll 2nd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers"]}, {"page": "Arthur Hugh Henry Batten-Pooll", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Batten-Pooll"]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians in the armed services", "response": ["*** Arthur Batten-Pooll VC, (1891\u20131971),"]}, {"page": "January 1971", "response": ["**Arthur Batten-Pooll, 79, English Victoria Cross recipient for actions in World War One."]}]}}
