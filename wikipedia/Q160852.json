In a career lasting over 60 years, he served for 12 years as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, spread over four terms beginning in 1868 and ending in 1894. He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer four times, serving over 12 years.\nGladstone was born in Liverpool to Scottish parents. He first entered the House of Commons in 1832, beginning his political career as a High Tory, a grouping which became the Conservative Party under Robert Peel in 1834. Gladstone served as a minister in both of Peel's governments, and in 1846 joined the breakaway Peelite faction, which eventually merged into the new Liberal Party in 1859. He was chancellor under Lord Aberdeen (1852\u20131855), Lord Palmerston (1859\u20131865) and Lord Russell (1865\u20131866). Gladstone's own political doctrine\u2014which emphasised equality of opportunity and opposition to trade protectionism\u2014came to be known as Gladstonian liberalism. His popularity amongst the working-class earned him the sobriquet \"The People's William\".\nIn 1868, Gladstone became prime minister for the first time. Many reforms were passed during his first ministry, including the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland and the introduction of secret voting. After electoral defeat in 1874, Gladstone resigned as leader of the Liberal Party. From 1876 he began a comeback based on opposition to the Ottoman Empire reaction to the Bulgarian April Uprising. His Midlothian Campaign of 1879\u201380 was an early example of many modern political campaigning techniques. After the 1880 general election, Gladstone formed his second ministry (1880\u20131885), which saw the passage of the Third Reform Act as well as crises in Egypt (culminating in the Fall of Khartoum) and Ireland, where his government passed repressive measures but also improved the legal rights of Irish tenant farmers.\nBack in office in early 1886, Gladstone proposed home rule for Ireland but was defeated in the House of Commons. The resulting split in the Liberal Party helped keep them out of office \u2013 with one short break \u2013 for 20 years. Gladstone formed his last government in 1892, at the age of 82. The Government of Ireland Bill 1893 passed through the Commons but was defeated in the House of Lords in 1893. Gladstone left office in March 1894, aged 84, as both the oldest person to serve as Prime Minister and the only prime minister to have served four terms. He left Parliament in 1895 and died three years later.\nGladstone was known affectionately by his supporters as \"The People's William\" or the \"G.O.M.\" (\"Grand Old Man\", or, to political rivals \"God's Only Mistake\"). Historians often call him one of Britain's greatest leaders. He was elected a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1881.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Carnegie", "response": ["In 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70-year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route. The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a Carnegie library which he funded. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a catalyst for a close association between English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with Samuel Storey, he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of \"the British Republic\". Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone."]}, {"page": "April 8", "response": ["*1886 \u2013 William Ewart Gladstone introduces the first Irish Home Rule Bill into the British House of Commons."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Disraeli", "response": ["Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield  (21 December 1804\u00a0\u2013 19 April 1881) was a British statesman and Conservative politician who twice served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He played a central role in the creation of the modern Conservative Party, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone, and his one-nation conservatism or \"Tory democracy\". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the British Empire. He is the only British prime minister to have been of Jewish birth. He was also a novelist, publishing works of fiction even as prime minister."]}, {"page": "Bram Stoker", "response": ["Stoker was raised a Protestant in the Church of Ireland. He was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party and took a keen interest in Irish affairs. As a \"philosophical home ruler\", he supported Home Rule for Ireland brought about by peaceful means. He remained an ardent monarchist who believed that Ireland should remain within the British Empire, an entity that he saw as a force for good.

Volume III (1880\u20131898) (London: Macmillan, 1903), p. 280. The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity.John Morley, The Life of Richard Cobden (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1905), p. 167. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay.Herbert Paul (ed.), Letters of Lord Acton to Mary Gladstone (Macmillan, 1914), p. 44.

Volume II (London: Longmans, 1876), p. 377. The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice.D. A. Hamer, John Morley. Liberal Intellectual in Politics (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. 65. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\".F. W. Hirst, Liberty and Tyranny (London: Duckworth, 1935), pp. 105\u201306. Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death it was to become his best known and most influential work and a manifesto for Conservative thinking."]}, {"page": "George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen", "response": ["After 1812 he became a diplomat, and in 1813, at age 29, was given the critically important embassy to Vienna, where he organized and financed the sixth coalition that defeated Napoleon. His rise in politics was equally rapid and lucky, and \"two accidents \u2014 Canning's death and Wellington's impulsive acceptance of the Canningite resignations\" led to his becoming Foreign Secretary for Prime Minister Wellington in 1828 despite \"an almost ludicrous lack of official experience\"; he had been a minister for less than six months. After holding the position for two years, followed by another cabinet role, by 1841 his experience led to his appointment as Foreign Secretary again under Robert Peel for a longer term.MacIntyre, 641 His diplomatic successes include organizing the coalition against Napoleon in 1812\u20131814, normalizing relations with post-Napoleonic France, settling the old border dispute between Canada and the United States, and ending the First Opium War with China in 1842, whereby Hong Kong was obtained. Aberdeen was a poor speaker, but this scarcely mattered in the House of Lords. He exhibited a \"dour, awkward, occasionally sarcastic exterior\".MacIntyre, 642, 644. His friend William Ewart Gladstone, said of him that he was \"the man in public life of all others whom I have . I say emphatically . I have  others, but never like him\".MacIntyre, 643, quoted"]}, {"page": "Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare", "response": ["After losing his seat, Bruce was elected for Renfrewshire on 25 January 1869, he was made Home Secretary by William Ewart Gladstone.  His tenure of this office was conspicuous for a reform of the licensing laws, and he was responsible for the Licensing Act 1872, which made the magistrates the licensing authority, increased the penalties for misconduct in public-houses and shortened the number of hours for the sale of drink. In 1873 Bruce relinquished the home secretaryship, at Gladstone's request, to become Lord President of the Council, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Aberdare, of Duffryn in the County of Glamorgan, on 23 August that year.Burke's Peerage, 107th edn. (2003), pp. 9\u201310 Being a Gladstonian Liberal, Aberdare had hoped for a much more radical proposal to keep existing licensee holders for a further ten years, and to prevent any new applicants.  Its unpopularity pricked his nonconformist's conscience, when like Gladstone himself he had a strong leaning towards Temperance.  He had already pursued 'moral improvement' on miners in the regulations attempting to further ban boys from the pits. The Trades Union Act 1871 was another more liberal regime giving further rights to unions, and protection from malicious prosecutions."]}, {"page": "May 19", "response": ["*1898 \u2013 William Ewart Gladstone, English lawyer and politician, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (b. 1809)"]}, {"page": "Opium", "response": ["The opium trade incurred intense enmity from the later British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. As a member of Parliament, Gladstone called it \"most infamous and atrocious\" referring to the opium trade between China and British India in particular. Gladstone was fiercely against both of the Opium Wars Britain waged in China in the First Opium War initiated in 1840 and the Second Opium War initiated in 1857, denounced British violence against Chinese, and was ardently opposed to the British trade in opium to China. Gladstone lambasted it as \"Palmerston's Opium War\" and said that he felt \"in dread of the judgments of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China\" in May 1840. A famous speech was made by Gladstone in Parliament against the First Opium War. Gladstone criticized it as \"a war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country with permanent disgrace\". His hostility to opium stemmed from the effects of opium brought upon his sister Helen. Due to the First Opium war brought on by Palmerston, there was initial reluctance to join the government of Peel on part of Gladstone before 1841."]}, {"page": "Received Pronunciation", "response": ["Traditionally, Received Pronunciation has been associated with high social class. It was the \"everyday speech in the families of Southern English persons whose men-folk [had] been educated at the great public boarding-schools\" and which conveyed no information about that speaker's region of origin before attending the school. An 1891 teacher's handbook stated, \u201cIt is the business of educated people to speak so that no-one may be able to tell in what county their childhood was passed\u201d. Nevertheless, in the 19th century some British prime ministers, such as  William Ewart Gladstone, still spoke with some regional features.Gladstone's speech was the subject of a book The Best English.

In this he did better than Darwin, who got no award of any kind from the state.

The concept is used to describe political repressions by governments against their own civilian populations with the purpose of inciting fear. For example, taking and executing civilian hostages or extrajudicial elimination campaigns are commonly considered \"terror\" or terrorism, for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror.Nicolas Werth, Karel Barto\u0161ek, Jean-Louis Pann\u00e9, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, St\u00e9phane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, hardcover, 858 pp.,  Such actions are often described as democide or genocide, which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism. Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide.Death by Government by R.J. Rummel New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1994.
