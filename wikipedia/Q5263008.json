He rose to fame in 1993 through appearances on the UK breakfast television show GMTV, where he performed live fitness sessions and offered tips and advice to viewers. In response to the popularity of his fitness sessions, he released a number of fitness and workout videos in the 1990s. \nThe name 'Motivator' was carefully chosen by Derrick to show his enthusiasm for fitness and also his association with Leicester and the famous secondary boys school he attended in the Highfieldss area of the city. He could have named himself Mr ' Moativator' to show his affiliation with  the 'Moat Boys' school located on Melbourne Road, Leicester. The school has now been renamed Moat Community College and has moved to Maidstone Road, Leicester. The old Moat Boys' building still exists and has been coverted to a Commmunity Medical Centre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kenton, London", "response": ["* TV exercise instructor Mr Motivator (Derrick Evans) lived in Kenton"]}, {"page": "Tessa Sanderson", "response": ["When Sky News was launched in 1989, she worked as a sports reporter for the channel.
