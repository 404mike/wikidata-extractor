It would also mark the first time John Evan had recorded a full album with the band, as his only prior involvement was to provide several keyboard parts on the previous 1970 album, Benefit. In December, the album became one of the first to be recorded at the newly opened studios of Island Records in Basing Street, London. Led Zeppelin were recording their untitled fourth album at the same time. In an interview on the 25th anniversary edition of the album, Tull's bandleader Ian Anderson said that trying to record in that studio was very difficult, because of its \"horrible, cold, echoey\" feel. There were two recording studios at the location; Led Zeppelin worked in the smaller studio while Tull got the larger, which was the main body of a converted church. The orchestral segments were arranged by Dee Palmer, who had worked with the band since 1968's This Was, and would later join as a keyboard player.

Palmer wrote significant portions of several songs, including the title track, \"Hunting Girl\", \"Velvet Green\", \"Ring Out, Solstice Bells\" and \"Pibroch (Cap in Hand)\" and also introduced the portative pipe organ to the rest of the band, an instrument which became a major element of the album's classical folk sound. The band made use of a variety of other instruments and recording techniques to contribute to the album's folk theme, including medieval-era percussion played by Barlow such as nakers and a tabor as well as a reverse echo guitar effect played by Barre on \"Pibroch (Cap in Hand)\" to imitate the sound of bagpipes. \"Ring Out, Solstice Bells\" was recorded with the intention of being a Christmas single. However Chrysalis Records disliked that the song was in 7/4 time and asked the band to re-record the song in the more common 4/4 time, a suggestion which Anderson said that the band \"weren't particularly pleased with.\"  The band re-recorded the song, now re-titled \"Magic Bells\" at Lansdowne Studios with Mike Batt of the Wombles producing, however the decision was eventually made by Chrysalis to scrap the new version and release the original instead.
