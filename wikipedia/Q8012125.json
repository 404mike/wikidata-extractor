The Portuguese Division of Francisco Silveira's continued the line to the south, with Hip\u00f3lito da Costa's brigade watching the Berderis Pass and Archibald Campbell's brigade posted at the heights above Aldudes. Historian Charles Oman asserted that Stewart's defensive arrangements were \"ludicrously incomplete\". The French had a large force at Urdax only  distant but routine reconnaissance patrols were not sent out. Cameron's brigade with four guns from Da Cunha's Portuguese battery was well-positioned across the main road at the west end of the Maya saddle, but at the east end there was only an 80-man picket on the Aretesque knoll. Pringle's brigade was camped  to the south in the village of Maya while the brigade's four light companies camped closer to the Maya Pass.", "thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Miniature oval portrait on ivory of a youthful-looking man who nevertheless has white hair.

The soldiers were tired from their long march and looked forward to camping for the evening. Suddenly, an aide-de-camp of Wellington galloped up and demanded, \"Take that hill before dark\".
