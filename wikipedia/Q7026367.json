He is the author of numerous books, and has served as staff writer and editor for Nature, Science, and the science section of The New York Times.His 2014 book A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History was widely denounced by the scientific community for misrepresenting research into human population genetics.In May 2021, Wade published an article in support of the COVID-19 lab leak hypothesis, fuelling the controversy around the origins of the virus.

It contains over three hundred annotations on the events and characters portrayed, with facsimile letters and contemporary photographs, many previously unpublished. Their sources include newly discovered correspondence from Crick, the papers of Franklin, Pauling, and Wilkins, and they include a chapter dropped from the original edition that described Watson's holiday in the Italian Alps in 1952. The edition was favorably reviewed in The New York Times by Nicholas Wade who commented, \"anyone seeking to understand modern biology and genomics could do much worse than start with the discovery of the structure of DNA, on which almost everything else is based. This edition includes several appendices, including letters by Crick and Watson giving the first account of the discovery, a previously unpublished chapter, an account of the controversy surrounding the publication, and the unsympathetic review by the late Erwin Chargaff from the March 29, 1968, issue of Science, which he previously declined permission to reprint in the 1980 Norton Critical Edition of The Double Helix edited by Gunther Stent."]}, {"page": "Tarim mummies", "response": ["* 'A Host of Mummies, A Forest of Secrets', Nicholas Wade, The New York Times, 15 March 2010."]}, {"page": "Elias Alsabti", "response": ["* Nicholas Wade and William Broad.

It is not a social construct\", and has pointed to writers like Nicholas Wade in defense of this point. McNallen also believes in an integral link connecting one's genetic or racial heritage to one's religion. He thus considers the ancient religion of the Aztecs to be inscribed on the subconscious of contemporary Mexicans, and the ancient religion of the Norse to be inscribed on the subconscious of those descended from ancient North Europeans. He regards Heathenry as belonging to all people descended from ancient northern Europeans and wants to make it as accessible as possible to this demographic, arguing that it is the religion best suited to fill the spiritual yearning of many white Americans. While typically linking Heathenry to peoples descended from ancient Northern Europeans, in some contexts, McNallen has referred to a broader, pan-European identity, stating that \"European cultures are all unique \u2014 unique that is, as variants on the basic European pattern.\""]}, {"page": "Marc Hauser", "response": ["The details of this investigation were not publicly released, and the lack of transparency evoked substantial speculation.
