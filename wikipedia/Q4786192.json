Since there are two United Kingdom peerages (e.g. Baron Worlingham) subsumed in that Irish Earldom, he was entitled to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was Lord Lieutenant of Armagh from 1883 to 1920, and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household of Queen Alexandra from 1901.He was Honorary Colonel of the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Irish Fusiliers from 1899, and Vice-Admiral of Ulster. Gosford died in London in 1922, aged 80, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.", "link_mentions": {}}}
