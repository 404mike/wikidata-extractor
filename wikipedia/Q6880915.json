It was replaced by human announcer Mitch Johnson, who, as well as providing commentary and links for each item, would interact with both the audience and the presenters too. From the second series, two puppet leprechauns, later named as Sage and Onion, became regulars. They were played by Don Austen and John Eccleston, and were designed and built by Darryl Worbey Studios. They performed comedy sketches throughout the morning, and often interacted with the people in the studio. Another comedy character who first appeared in the third series was Mr Blobby, who had previously appeared in Noel's House Party. Most regular features were dropped for the final series, when the show was revamped. A feature that stuck throughout was the jingle for the phone number, first 081 811 8181, then 0181 811 8181, then 0845 610 1515."]}, {"page": "102.2 Smooth FM", "response": ["The station's jingle package was produced by Bespoke and voiced by Mitch Johnson."]}, {"page": "Mitchell Johnson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Mitch Johnson (born 1942), American football player", "*Mitch Johnson (announcer) (born 1966), British television and radio presenter"]}, {"page": "Big Game TV", "response": ["*Mitch Johnson (announcer)"]}, {"page": "List of Live 8 artists", "response": ["*Andi Peters, Andy Townsend, Anouschka Menzies, Barry Killerby, David Beckham, Denis Irwin, Don Austen, Emma Ledden, Emma Forbes, Frank Stapleton, Gareth Southgate, Gary Lineker, Gary McFadden, Harriet Thorpe, Harrison Oldroyd, Heather Suttie, Geoff Hurst, George Cohen, Jack Charlton, Jamie Theakston, Jason McAteer, Jill Greenacre, John Aldridge, John Barrowman, John Eccleston, Julia St. John, Katy Hill, Kenny Cunningham, Kevin Keegan, Kevin Moran, Martin Peters, Matt Le Tissier, Mike Burns, Mitch Johnson, Norman Hunter, Ortis Deley, Packie Bonner, Peter Shilton, Peter Simon, Pippa Haywood, Ray Houghton, Ron Atkinson, Ron Harris, Ronnie Whelan, Russell Porter, Sarah Cawood, Stephen Churchett, Steve Staunton, Steve Wilson, Thomas Sangster, Tim Marriott, Trevor and Simon, Trey Farley & Zoe Ball."]}]}}
