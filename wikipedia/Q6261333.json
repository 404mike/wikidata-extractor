By the age of four he weighed 12 stone (170 lb; 76 kg) and was taken to be examined by the doctor, Sir Frederick Treves. When he started school at six he had a 44-inch (1,100 mm) chest and 46-inch (1,200 mm) waist. He achieved national prominence when Lord Northcliffe ran a critical story about London County Council\u2019s decision to extend an existing tramway 400 yards (370 m) because Trunley could no longer walk to Reddins School. Shortly after this he began to tour England under the management of entrepreneurs such as Fred Karno. Trunley appeared on the music halls informing the audience \"I want to be a jockey\". After the First World War he negotiated a film contract playing small character parts. He married and had children, before dying of pulmonary TB in 1944. He is buried in Camberwell New Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Fat Boy of Peckham", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Trunley"]}, {"page": "Camberwell Cemeteries", "response": ["* John Trunley (1898\u20131944) a local celebrity who appeared on stage with Fred Karno in the early 20th century as a \"fat boy\" (he weighted 33 stone at age 18)London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer, by Hugh Meller & Brian Parsons"]}, {"page": "Trunley, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Trunley"]}]}}
