Gilchrist's biography of Blake is still a standard reference work about the poet.\nGilchrist was born at Newington Green, then just to the north of London, son of the minister of the Unitarian church there. Although he studied law, Gilchrist adopted literary and art criticism as his main pursuits. He settled at Guildford during 1853, where he wrote Life of William Etty, R.A.. In 1856 he became a next-door neighbour of his friend Thomas Carlyle at Chelsea and his wife Jane Welsh Carlyle, both of them notable writers. Gilchrist had all but finished his Life of William Blake when he contracted scarlet fever from one of his children and died.His wife Anne helped to complete the Life (his magnum opus), and survived him by 24 years. Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his brother William also contributed to the completion of the book.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Blake", "response": ["Blake's first biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed Newgate Prison.Gilchrist, A., The Life of William Blake, London, 1842, p. 30. The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the Gordon Riots and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of George III, and the creation of the first police force.", "Blake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time Alexander Gilchrist began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the Life of William Blake rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by Pre-Raphaelites and associated figures, in particular Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included S. Foster Damon, Geoffrey Keynes, Northrop Frye, David V. Erdman and G.

He made little effort to explain this to his audience, and thus Candaules appeared morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges. From the moment it was unveiled Candaules was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images, and there was near-unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition. The piece remained controversial long after Etty's death; Alexander Gilchrist's overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of Etty described it as \"almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject\", while as late as 2011 Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote of Candaules that \"it is perhaps hard to see the painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise\".

Gilchrist also notes that it was never mentioned in the Monthly Review, even in the magazine's index of \"Books noticed\", which listed every book published in London each month, signifying that the publication of the book had gone virtually unnoticed.Gilchrist (1998: 42) Nevertheless, Blake himself was proud enough of the volume that he was still giving copies to friends as late as 1808, and when he died, several unstitched copies were found amongst his belongings.", "After the initial 1783 publication, Poetical Sketches as a volume remained unpublished until R. H. Shepherd's edition in 1868.Bentley and Nurmi (1964: 55) However, prior to that, several of the individual poems had been published in journals and anthologised by Blake's early biographers and editors.In Part I of A Blake Bibliography, Bentley and Nurmi give an extensive publication history of each poem. For example, Benjamin Heath Malkin included 'Song: \"How sweet I roam'd from field to field\"' and 'Song: \"I love the jocund dance\"' in A Father's Memoirs of his Child (1806), Allan Cunningham published 'Gwin, King of Norway' and 'To the Muses' in Lives of the most eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1830), and Alexander Gilchrist included 'Song: \"When early morn walks forth in sober grey\"' in his Life of William Blake (1863). Gilchrist, however, did not reproduce Blake's text verbatim, instead incorporating several of his own emendations. Many subsequent editors of Blake who included extracts in their collections of his poetry, such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, A. C. Swinburne, W. B. Yeats and E. J. Ellis, also introduced their own emendations. Due to the extreme rarity of the original publication, these emendations often went unnoticed, thus giving rise to a succession of variant readings on the original content. Subsequent versions repeated or added to these changes, despite what later commentators described as obvious misreadings. However, in 1905, John Sampson produced the first scholarly edition of Blake's work, in which he returned to the original texts, also taking into account Blake's own handwritten corrections. As such, most modern editors tend to follow Sampson's example, and use the original 1783 publication as their control text.For more information on the variations between different editions, see the collations in, for example, Sampson (1905), Keynes (1957 and 1966), Erdman (1965 and 1982), Ostriker (1977) and Stevenson (1971, 1989 and 2007)"]}, {"page": "An Island in the Moon", "response": ["The overriding theory as to the main impetus behind An Island is that it allegorises Blake's rejection of the bluestocking society of Harriet Mathew, who, along with her husband, Reverend Anthony Stephen Mathew organised 'poetical evenings' to which came many of Blake's friends (such as John Flaxman, Thomas Stothard and Joseph Johnson) and, on at least one occasion, Blake himself.Ackroyd (1995: 82\u201385) The Mathews had been behind the publication in 1783 of Blake's first collection of poetry, Poetical Sketches,Ackroyd (1995: 94) but by 1784, Blake had supposedly grown weary of their company and the social circles in which they moved, and chose to distance himself from them. This theory can be traced back to an 1828 'Biographical Sketch' of Blake by his friend in later life, the painter J. T. Smith, published in the second volume of Smith's biography of Joseph Nollekens, Nollekens and his times. Smith's references to the Mathew family's association with Blake were taken up and elaborated upon by Blake's first biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, in his 1863 biography Life of William Blake, Pictor Ignotus., and from that point forth, the prevailing belief as to the primary background of An Island is that it dramatises Blake's disassociation from the social circles in which he found himself.See Erdman (1977: 93n12)"]}, {"page": "Life of William Blake", "response": ["The book was largely written by Alexander Gilchrist, who had spent many years compiling the material and interviewing Blake's surviving friends.
