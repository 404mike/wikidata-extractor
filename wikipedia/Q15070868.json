Kchessinska partnered him in La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e, where he succeeded in an atypical role for him involving humour and flirtation. Designer Alexandre Benois proposed a ballet based upon Le Pavillon d'Armide, choreographed by Fokine to music by Nikolai Tcherepnin. Nijinsky had a minor role, but it allowed him to show off his technical abilities with leaps and pirouettes. The partnership of Fokine, Benois and Nijinsky was repeated throughout his career. Shortly after, he upstaged his own performance, appearing in the Bluebird pas de deux from the Sleeping Beauty, partnering Lydia Kyasht. The Mariinsky audience was deeply familiar with the piece, but exploded with enthusiasm for his performance and his appearing to fly, an effect he continued to have on audiences with the piece during his career."]}, {"page": "Kay Kendall", "response": ["She had two elder siblings, Terrence Justin \"Terry\" Kendall McCarthy (born 1923) and Patricia Kim \"Pat\" Kendall McCarthy (a.k.a.
