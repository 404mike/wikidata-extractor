He emigrated to South Africa, arriving in Cape Town in 1878. By the late 1870s, rugby football was very much battling to survive against Winchester College football. Milton joined Villagers club and preached the cause of rugby, and by the end of that year the football fraternity of Cape Town had all but abandoned the Winchester game in favour of rugby.\nHe made his Test cricket debut in South Africa's first Test of all, at Port Elizabeth in 1888-89. He was made captain for the Second Test at Cape Town, replacing Owen Dunell, and made his third and final appearance (again at Cape Town) in 1891-92. He played three other first-class games: two for Western Province and one for Cape Town Clubs.\nMilton then moved to Mashonaland and under the influence of his friend Cecil John Rhodes was Mashonaland's third Administrator from 24 July 1897 to 24 January 1901. In 1901 it was decided to combine the administration of Mashonaland and Matabeleland that had been separated three years before, and Milton then became the Administrator of the whole of Southern Rhodesia. He retired in 1914 at the age of 60. In 1922, the biggest school in Bulawayo at the time was renamed Milton High School in his honour.\nHe had three sons, Cecil and John, both of whom would play rugby for England, and Noel, who played for Oxford University. He died in Cannes, France, at the age of 75.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of rugby union", "response": ["When Canon George Ogilvie became headmaster of Diocesan College in Cape Town, South Africa in 1861, he introduced the game of football, as played at Winchester College. This version of football, which included handling of the ball, is seen as the beginnings of rugby in South Africa. In around 1875 rugby began to be played in the Cape Colony, the following year the first rugby (as opposed to Winchester football) club was formed. Former England international William Henry Milton arrived in Cape Town in 1878. He joined the Villagers club and started playing and preaching rugby. By the end of that year, Cape Town had all but abandoned the Winchester game in favour of rugby. In 1883, the Stellenbosch club was formed in the predominantly Boer farming district outside Cape Town and rugby was enthusiastically adopted by the young Boer farmers. As British and Boer migrated to the interior, they helped spread the game from the Cape colony through the Eastern Cape, and Natal, and along the gold and diamond routes to Kimberley and Johannesburg. However, for a number of years, South African rugby would be hindered by systemic racial segregation."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were knighted", "response": ["*Sir William Henry Milton (born in England; 1854\u20131930), knighted for his service as Administrator of Mashonaland and later as Administrator of Southern Rhodesia."]}, {"page": "William Milton", "response": ["* William Henry Milton (1854-1930), rugby player and cricketer in South Africa who became Administrator of Southern Rhodesia from 1901 to 1914"]}, {"page": "1905 Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election", "response": ["* Sir Thomas Charles Scanlen KCMG, Additional Law Officer (also Acting Administrator from May 24, 1907 during the absence of Sir William Henry Milton)"]}, {"page": "Administrative posts of the British South Africa Company in Southern Rhodesia", "response": ["* 5 December 1898 \u2013 20 December 1901: William Henry Milton (Administrator of Mashonaland and Senior Administrator of Southern Rhodesia)", "* 20 December 1901 \u2013 1 November 1914: Sir William Henry Milton ", "* 1897 \u2013 1898: William Henry Milton"]}, {"page": "1890s in Zimbabwe", "response": ["* 24 July \u2013 William Henry Milton becomes the 3rd Administrator of Mashonaland and Administrator of the Rhodesia Protectorate "]}, {"page": "Rugby union in South Africa", "response": ["Around 1875, rugby began to be played in the Cape colony; the same year the first rugby (as opposed to Winchester football) club, Hamilton, was formed in Sea Point, Cape Town.Hamilton Sea Point RFC   Former England international William Henry Milton arrived in Cape Town in 1878.
