Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. Erik Satie was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. Paul Dukas is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as Ottorino Respighi (Italy), Ralph Vaughan Williams, Cyril Scott, and John Ireland (England), Manuel De Falla and Isaac Albeniz (Spain), and Charles Griffes (America)."]}, {"page": "September 27", "response": ["*  1879   \u2013 Cyril Scott, English poet and composer (d. 1970)"]}, {"page": "1970", "response": ["* December 31 \u2013 Cyril Scott, English composer, writer, and poet (b. 1879)"]}, {"page": "1879", "response": ["** Cyril Scott, English composer and writer (d. 1970)"]}, {"page": "Maurice Ravel", "response": ["After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina.

Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era. Faur\u00e9 wrote to him, \"I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly. It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor.\"Orenstein (2003), pp. 230\u2013231 Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Les Six as an establishment figure. Satie had turned against him, and commented, \"Ravel refuses the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it.\"Kelly (2013), p. 56 Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development. Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks. He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style.Kelly (2000), p. 25 Through the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Musicale Ind\u00e9pendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries.

The result of this was that Scott took Rubbra on as a pupil.

After a year or so, Rubbra gained a scholarship to University College, Reading. Gustav Holst became one of his teachers there.
