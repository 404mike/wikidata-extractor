He moved to Lancaster in 1832, and in 1840 became Visiting Physician at the Lancaster County Lunatic Asylum. In 1864 James Brunton offered \u00a32,000 towards a new asylum for \"idiots and imbeciles\" and asked De Vitre's assistance. De Vitre was the Chairman of the Committee for the new asylum, and oversaw its establishment. The foundation stone was laid in 1868 and it received its first patients on 14 December 1870.De Vitre died at Elms, Bare, Lancaster, on 4 October 1878.In September 2012 a community resource centre for the Lancashire Care NHS Trust, in Ashton Road near the former Royal Albert Hospital, was named DeVitre House in his honour, after a competition in which local residents were asked to choose its name.  The hospital itself closed in 1996 and the buildings now house an Islamic educational establishment for girls, Jamea Al Kauthar Islamic College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Dennis de Vitre", "response": ["#REDIRECTEdward Denis de Vitre "]}, {"page": "Edward de Vitre", "response": ["#REDIRECTEdward Denis de Vitre"]}, {"page": "Edward Denis de Vitr\u00e9", "response": ["#REDIRECTEdward Denis de Vitre "]}, {"page": "De Vitre", "response": ["* Edward Denis de Vitre (1806-1878), English physician"]}, {"page": "Greaves Park Hotel, Lancaster", "response": ["During the time that Samuel lived on the Isle of Man he rented the house to wealthy tenants.
