He made one appearance for England in 1929. \t\nPowerful inside-left who scored a hat-trick on his league debut for Barnsley and managed two hat-tricks while he was with Leeds. He became a regular at Elland Road and was a popular figure with the fans in his six years with the club (1925\u201331). He picked up his only cap in 1929 in England's 0\u20131 defeat by the Scots in Glasgow in a match decided just two minutes from time by a goal scored direct from a corner. Wainscoat left Leeds for Hull in 1931 and helped them to the Division 3 North title two years later. He died at the age of 69. He played 226 games for Leeds scoring 93 times (info from http://www.leeds-fans.org.uk/leeds/players/521.html which states he played for Barnsley, Middlesbrough, Leeds then Hull)\nHe was born in East Retford, Nottinghamshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Retford", "response": ["* Russell Wainscoat, footballer"]}, {"page": "Arthur Fairclough (football manager)", "response": ["He started his managerial career with Barnsley, being there between 1898 until 1901. He was replaced by John McCartney until 1904, when he came back as manager until 1912, and won the FA Cup with them in his last season in charge (of his 2nd spell). After his success at Barnsley, he was persuaded to join Huddersfield where he laid the groundwork for the success to be achieved by Herbert Chapman. When Huddersfield chairman Hilton Crowther decided that a Leeds-based team would be a better vehicle for his attentions, he persuaded his manager to move with him, and so Fairclough took over from Dick Ray as Leeds United manager for the club's first full season in the Football League. Fairclough put together a useful team, and in 1923-24 he saw his side win promotion to the First Division. The following year saw the signing of the goal-scoring talents of Tom Jennings and Russell Wainscoat, to stand alongside the defensive abilities of Ernest Hart and Tom Townsley. Despite Jennings astonishing haul of 35 goals in 42 games, 1926-27 saw the side relegated and Fairclough resigned in the close season. He briefly returned to management with Barnsley in 1929, but resigned after a year in the job."]}, {"page": "List of Leeds United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Russell Wainscoat"]}, {"page": "List of Leeds United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["#Russell Wainscoat 93"]}, {"page": "List of Hull City A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Dally DuncanRussell Wainscoat||19"]}, {"page": "Billy Furness", "response": ["At this time Leeds were struggling in the lower reaches of the First Division and were getting something of a reputation for being a yo-yo team \u2013 after being elected to the Second Division in 1920, they were promoted in 1924, relegated in 1927 and promoted again in 1928. Furness took a while to break into the first team, with Russell Wainscoat and Eric Longden having established themselves in the inside forward positions. In the 1930\u201331 season Furness displaced Longden and from then on he was rarely out of the side, but his eight goals were unable to stave off relegation and Leeds were to spend the 1931\u201332 season in the Second Division. With Charlie Keetley scoring 23 goals and 12 from Furness, Leeds returned to the top flight as runners-up in Division Two."]}, {"page": "Frank Matthews (footballer)", "response": ["At Barnsley, Matthews replaced Russell Wainscoat at inside-left after Wainscoat left to join Middlesbrough in December 1923.
