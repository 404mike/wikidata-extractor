Ward taught him phonetics and drilled him with ear-training and transcription exercises. John Rupert Firth, who would later work at the University College Phonetics Department himself along Armstrong, was a student at University College from 1923 to 1924; the classes he took included Armstrong's course in French Phonetics. In the summer of 1934, Scottish phonetician J. C. Catford, then age 17, took a class in French phonetics taught by Armstrong and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Coustenoble. Armstrong taught advanced phonetics to American linguist Lorenzo Dow Turner while he was doing postdoctoral research at the School of Oriental Studies from 1936 to 1937.", "One contemporary review of this book referred to the amount of specialized phonetic symbols and diacritics as a \"profusion of diacritical marks that is rather confusing\". Pe Maung Tin responded to this by clarifying the diacritics were necessary to convey the interaction of tone and prosody and to ensure that English speakers did not read the texts with an English intonation. He also defended other transcription choices like using \"\" to represent an aspirated alveolar fricative as in the Burmese word  (, \"oil\"), which Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin transcribed as \"\";; . the reviewer thought it was confusing to use \"\" to refer to a sound other than the post-alveolar fricative represented by the English  as in the word she (). R. Grant Brown, a former member of the Indian Civil Service in Burma, praised A Burmese Phonetic Reader for being the joint work of a phonetician and a native speaker, writing \"This excellent little book sets a standard which other writers on living Oriental languages will have to follow if they do not wish their work to be regarded as second-rate\", although he thought their transcription system was \"too elaborate for ordinary use\". British linguist John Rupert Firth used a broad transcription which he simplified from Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's system based in part on his experience using their Reader with Burmese speakers and with students of Burmese phonetics at Oxford's Indian Institute. Burmese linguist Minn Latt said their transcription system used too many \"unfamiliar symbols\" for an ideal romanization scheme. British linguist Justin Watkins used Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's translation of \"The North Wind and the Sun\" for his 2001 illustration of the IPA for Burmese in the Journal of the International Phonetic Association."]}, {"page": "1946 New Year Honours", "response": ["* John Rupert Firth, Professor of General Linguistics, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London."]}, {"page": "Firthian", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Rupert Firth#Contributions to linguistics "]}, {"page": "Arthur Thomas Hatto", "response": ["In an effort to improve his German Hatto left in 1932 for the University of Bern, where, through John Rupert Firth's earlier instruction, he became a Lektor for English.
