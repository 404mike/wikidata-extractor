Davis' mother reportedly considered Rutherford an unsuitable match for her son, and their wedding was postponed until after Mrs. Davis had died. Subsequently, the couple appeared in many productions together. Davis adored Rutherford, with one friend noting: \"For him she was not only a great talent but, above all, a beauty.\" The former serviceman and actor rarely left his wife's side, serving Rutherford as private secretary and general dogsbody. More importantly, he nursed and comforted her through periodic debilitating depressions. These illnesses, sometimes involving stays in mental hospitals and electric shock treatment, were kept hidden from the press during Rutherford's life. The Marple films capture something of the couple's public personae as projected in the press at the time: their cosy domesticity, erratic housekeeping and almost childlike innocence and affection."]}, {"page": "After the Funeral", "response": ["* The addition of film character 'Mr Stringer' (played by Stringer Davis, Margaret Rutherford's real-life husband),"]}, {"page": "Gerrards Cross", "response": ["The large and distinctive parish church is dedicated to St. James.
