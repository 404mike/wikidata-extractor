Born in Norwich, Carter is notable for his design and restoration to churches in South Wales, and in particular Glamorgan. He was partnered with John Pollard Seddon from 1884 to 1904 and after he maintained a style steeped in the traditions of the Arts and Crafts Movement to create impressive buildings such as the monastery on Caldey Island and St Luke's Church in Abercarn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Caldey Island", "response": ["The current abbey was built in 1910 by Anglican Benedictine monks but financial problems beginning in 1925 led to the 1929 purchase of the property by Belgian Cistercians. It is considered to be the most complete example of the Arts and Crafts style in the country, and was the largest project of John Coates Carter. At the time of building, the abbey was called \"the greatest phenomenon in the Anglican community at the present time\". The roofs are of white roughcast with red tiling, and the abbey church has five side-windows and on the south a \"tapering\" tower with primitive crenellations.

Seddon was surveyor to Llandaff Cathedral and most of his work was church building and parsonages for the Llandaff Diocese.Antonia Brodie ed (2001)Directory of British Architects, 1834\u20131914: Vol. 2 (L-Z), 575-6,.British Architectural Library, Royal Institute of British Architects Continuum 2001.", "However he built some notable country houses such as Abermad House in Llanilar Ceredigion in 1870\u20131872 and most notably the Old College Building of Aberystwyth University. The Old College Building is on the seafront and replaced Castle House, which had been built for Uvedale Price by John Nash in 1791\u20131794. Castle House had been bought by the railway entrepreneur Thomas Savin in 1864 and he employed Seddon to rebuild it as a hotel. Following Savin's bankruptcy in 1866, it was purchased by the future university and until 1890 Seddon together with his partner John Coates Carter continued to rebuild and extend the building. The Builder described it as one of the most original and characteristic monuments of the Gothic Revival, while Thomas Lloyd writes Seddon's originality lies in his very fluid use of curves and complex geometrical forms, and in the blurring of angles and joints, syncopation that has something of Art Nouveau. Seddon mixes detail of Early English with Venetian and French late Romanesque and Gothic Architecture. The stone used comes from Cefn at Minera, dressed with Bath stone. He also used an artificial stone and concrete in parts of the building. John Coates Carter was to go on to design the Paget Concert Rooms at Penarth in 1906 and the remarkable monastery complex on Caldey Island, Pembrokeshire.
