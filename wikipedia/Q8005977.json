Bromley, who was born at Carisbrooke on the Isle of Wight, was apprenticed to an engraver named J G Wooding in London, and soon attracted favorable notice.\nOf his early works the most popular are the prints in 'Macklin's Bible,' and his engravings of Stothard's designs illustrating the 'History of England.' He engraved also two of Sir Thomas Lawrence's portraits of the Duke of Wellington, and one of the young Napoleon.\nBromley was elected an associate engraver of the Royal Academy in 1819, and was employed for many years by the trustees of the British Museum in engraving the Elgin Marbles after drawings by Henry Corbould (1787\u20131844). He was the grandfather of 19th-century British artist Valentine Walter Bromley.", "link_mentions": {}}}
