Southampton West End station, subsequently relocated and presently known as Southampton Central lies to the West of the Tunnel. The experienced civil engineer Samuel Morton Peto acted as contractor for the works with the majority of the tunnel being constructed using traditional cut-and-cover techniques. Its route cut through that of the Salisbury and Southampton Canal, an incomplete project that had partially built an earlier tunnel; the presence of this earlier engineering work would negatively impact the project due to the prior disturbance of the ground. The tunnel suffered a collapse during construction, and subsequent movement of the structure delayed its opening until two months after that of the rest of the line, being finally opened to traffic for the first time during August 1847.", "The Southampton and Dorchester Railway's railway's engineer was William Moorsom and the contractor for the construction of the line was Samuel Morton Peto through his company Messrs Grissell and Peto. It was decided to construct the majority of the tunnel using the traditional cut-and-cover method, with only a limited section (the portion running directly underneath the London Road) being actually bored out. Experienced miners from Cornwall were recruited for the project as their specialist skills were valued for the bored section.  The pre-existing incomplete canal tunnel crossed the intended route of the new railway tunnel at an acute angle and a slightly lower level near their western ends. A contemporary scale cross sectional drawing dated June 1847 shows that, close to the point at which the two tunnels met, the base of the canal tunnel was only slightly lower than that of the railway tunnel and that the level of the water it contained was at a similar level to the base of the new tunnel. The canal tunnel had itself proven difficult to construct, with various sections sinking or collapsing due to geological conditions, poor materials and improper supervision of the works. It became apparent that the canal works had compromised the ground considerably, and despite removal of a section of the older tunnel where it was crossed by the new structure, geological problems accentuated by heavy rain and hard frosts in 1846/47 plagued the railway tunnel's construction. Buildings in the vicinity of The London Road (later Above Bar Street) suffered subsidence and there were concerns expressed about the state of the road.Castlemans Corkscrew, Volume 1, The Nineteenth Centuary, B L Jackson, Oakwood Press 2007"]}, {"page": "Mechtilde Lichnowsky", "response": ["Princess Mechtilde Lichnowsky, originally Mechtilde Christiane Marie Gr\u00e4fin von und zu Arco-Zinneberg, later Mechtilde Peto (8 March 1879, in Schloss Sch\u00f6nburg, Pocking:de:Sch\u00f6nburg (Pocking), now in the Kreis Passau \u2013 4 June 1958, in London) was a German author, married to Karl Max, F\u00fcrst von Lichnowsky, 6th Prince and 8th Count Lichnowsky (1860\u20131928) who succeeded his father in 1901, and served as Imperial German Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, 1912\u20131914.FemBiografie Mechtilde Lichnowsky In 1937 she married Ralph Harding Peto, grandson of Sir Samuel Morton Peto, 1st Baronet."]}, {"page": "Wadham Wyndham (political supporter)", "response": ["Penruddocke Wyndham married Mary Peto, eldest daughter of Sir Samuel Morton Peto, 1st Baronet.

Samuel Morton Peto said that if they built a line to Brandon, 40 miles to the west, then the existing railways would compete to join it at Brandon, so completing a through connection to the other lines.

The harbour at Lowestoft, much used for its fishing fleet, was falling into disrepair, and something would need to be done to improve that too.
