He was brought up by the family of Admiral Robert Blake in Bridgwater and later became involved in trade through the port of Bristol.His first writings were poetry and dramas, among them being Amores Britannici; Epistles Historical and Gallant (1703); and a tragedy, The Governor of Cyprus. His earliest historical work was The British Empire in America (1708), followed by The Secret History of Europe (1712-1715); Arcana Gallica, Or the Secret History of France for the Last Century (1714); and other smaller writings.More important, although very biased, are Oldmixon's works on English history. His Critical History of England (1724-1726) contains attacks on Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and a defence of Bishop Gilbert Burnet, and its publication led to a controversy between Dr Zachary Grey and the author, who replied to Grey in his Clarendon and Whitlock Compared (1727).  On the same lines he wrote his History of England During the Reigns of the Royal House of Stuart (1730).  Herein he charged Francis Atterbury and other editors with tampering with the text of the History. From his exile Atterbury replied to this charge in a Vindication, and although Oldmixon continued the controversy it is practically certain that he was in the wrong.\nHe completed a continuous history of England by writing the History of England During the Reigns of William and Mary, Anne and George I (1735); and the History of England During the Reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth (1739). Among his other writings are, Memoirs of North Britain (1715), Essay on Criticism (1728) and Memoirs of the Press 1710-1740 (1742), which was only published after his death. Oldmixon had much to do with editing two periodicals, The Muses Mercury and The Medley, and he often complained that his services were overlooked by the government.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 9", "response": ["*1742 \u2013 John Oldmixon, English historian, poet, and playwright (b. 1673)"]}, {"page": "1742", "response": ["* July 9 \u2013 John Oldmixon, English historian (b. 1673)"]}, {"page": "1712 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon"]}, {"page": "1714 in literature", "response": ["**The Court of Atalantis (attributed to Delarivier Manley or possibly John Oldmixon or others)"]}, {"page": "1716 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 Memoirs of Ireland from the Restoration to the Present Times"]}, {"page": "1724 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The Critical History of England, Ecclesiastical and Civil"]}, {"page": "1725 in literature", "response": ["*Zachary Grey \u2013 A Defence of Our Antient and Modern Historians (against John Oldmixon)", "*John Oldmixon \u2013 A Review of Dr. Zachary Grey's Defence"]}, {"page": "1727 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 Clarendon and Whitlock Compar'd"]}, {"page": "1728 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon"]}, {"page": "1729 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The History of England, during the Reigns of the Royal House of Stuart"]}, {"page": "1735 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The History of England, during the Reigns of William and Mary, Anne, George I"]}, {"page": "1739 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The History of England during the Reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth"]}, {"page": "1742 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 Memoirs of the Press, Historical and Political", "*July 9 \u2013 John Oldmixon, English historian (born 1673)"]}, {"page": "1700 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The Grove, or Love's Paradise published (\"semi-opera\", music by Henry Purcell)"]}, {"page": "1703 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The Governour of Cyprus"]}, {"page": "1702 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The Governor of Cyprus"]}, {"page": "1707 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The Muses Mercury (periodical)"]}, {"page": "1708 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 The British Empire in America"]}, {"page": "1699 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 Reflections on the Stage, and Mr Collier's Defence of the Short View"]}, {"page": "1698 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 Amintas (adapted from Aminta of Tasso)"]}, {"page": "1696 in literature", "response": ["*John Oldmixon \u2013 Poems on Several Occasions"]}, {"page": "1673 in literature", "response": ["**John Oldmixon, English historian (died 1742)"]}, {"page": "Edmund Curll", "response": ["His connection with the anonymously published Court Poems in 1716 led to the long quarrel with Alexander Pope.  Curll got three anonymous poems, by Pope, John Gay, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.  Pope wrote to Curll warning him not to publish the poems, which only confirmed for Curll the authorship.  He published them.  In response, Pope and Bernard Lintot, Pope's publisher, met with Curll at the Swan tavern.  Pope and Lintot seemed resigned and worried only for John Gay's prospects.  However, they had filled Curll's glass with an emetic, causing him, when he went home, to go into convulsions of vomiting.  Pope published two pamphlet accounts of the incident and informed the public (a la Swift's Bickerstaff Papers) that Curll was dead.  Curll seized upon the publicity for his own purposes, as well.  He published and advertised John Oldmixon's The Catholick Poet and John Dennis's The True Character of Mr Pope and his Writings.

Those objectives were a strong Parliament, a limited monarchy, resistance to France, and the Protestant succession to the throne. Downes cites John Oldmixon, who knew many of those involved, and who wrote in 1735 of how some club members \"before the Revolution [of 1688] met frequently in the Evening at a Tavern, near Temple Bar, to unbend themselves after Business, and have a little free and cheerful Conversation in those dangerous Times\".

A very wealthy nobleman, attended by jockeys, huntsmen, a large sedan chair with six porters, takes his seat. One poet attempts to flatter his pride. A painter attempts to paint a glowing portrait. An opera author attempts to please his ears. John Oldmixon simply asks for the money (Oldmixon had attacked Pope in The Catholic Poet, but Pope claims that his real crime was plagiarism in his Critical History of England, which slandered the Stuarts and got him an office from the Whig ministry), only to have the lord clench his money tighter. Finally, a young man with no artistic ability sends his sister to the lord and wins the prize."]}, {"page": "Edward Maria Wingfield", "response": ["Up to the 1980s, Wingfield's reputation as a villain stems from his chief rival, John Smith, who was apparently prone to supreme exaggeration.Western Star, Book One, [New York, 1943]; Brown, sub EMW, II, p.1055; p.53. Newly freed from arrest, Smith wrote of Wingfield's \"overweening jealousy\" i.e. supremely self-confident and suspicious of rivalry \u2013 which one could argue are two necessary qualities required by a commander. Command is lonely and doubtless the \"cliqueyness\" of the \"Cape Cod Crew of 1602\" (Gosnold, Martin and Archer), the Middle Temple lawyers (Gosnold and Percy) and the \"generation gap\" problem between Wingfield aged 57 vis-a-vis Smith aged 27 (and many men in their 20s and 30s), did not help. Smith also described Wingfield and probably Percy and NewportSmith's so-called History of Virginia is not a history at all; but a eulogy of Smith and a lampoon of his peers\". Brown, II, p. 1010; Barbour, p. 391. as \"tufftaffety humorists\" i.e. overdressed, full of humour and laughter but liable to mood swings. Smith's views of President Wingfield were repeated by John Oldmixon in 1708, then further downgraded by the author of his entry in the (British) Dictionary of Biography of 1880, and more so by Barbour (1964), Smith's biographer. Barbour was obsessively anti-Wingfield, describing him as an aristocrat (i.e. a baron, marquess, viscount, earl or duke), which Wingfield was not, nor before 1618 had any member of his family ever been (although his grandfather was awarded the Knight of the Garter, for his work as an ambassador); and (b) as having three servants at Jamestown; but Smith was no farmer's lad. Smith too was a Captain, had three servants at Jamestown,Smith, GH. possessed a coat of arms, owned property (in Louth, Lincolnshire), had a well-to-do tenant farmer father; and was, moreover, raised with the younger Bertie children and was given a personal equestrian course by the Henry, 2nd Earl of Lincoln, of Tattershall Castle.Smith's servants were Anas Todkill, \"his man\" (not Anas), and pageboy Samuel Collier.

Pope  accused them of attacking his translation of Homer prior to anything even being written, and with some justice, and Duckett continued the battle with An Epilogue to a Puppet Show at Bath Concerning the same Iliad by himself.  Edmund Curll, in his battle against Pope, published the Epilogue.  Pope's revenge appeared in The Dunciad of 1728, and in particular in the Dunciad Variorum.  Because of their positions in government, Pope did not attack Duckett and Burnet by name in Dunciad itself, and he did not directly impugn them until the Variorum.  Duckett and Burnet also funded and contributed to two weekly journals, The Grumbler and Pasquin.  He was also the patron of one of Pope's other enemies, John Oldmixon."]}, {"page": "Fleetwood Sheppard", "response": ["Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage.  For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf.  At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen's, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\" In A New Way of Selling Places at Court in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly.  In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter.", "Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others.  He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discovered\" Paradise Lost when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair.  He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents.  He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon.  He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change.  Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses."]}, {"page": "Semi-opera", "response": ["*The Grove, or Love's Paradise (1700) libretto by John Oldmixon; music by Daniel Purcell"]}, {"page": "Lisle's Tennis Court", "response": ["* The Governor of Cyprus by John Oldmixon (1702)"]}, {"page": "James Ralph", "response": ["In 1744\u201346, Ralph wrote one of his two most important works, A history of England during the reigns of King William, Queen Anne, and King George I, with an introductory review of the royal brothers Charles and James.  The work ran to two volumes and never got beyond William's reign.  However, the work was a direct counter to the histories of John Oldmixon and other whig historians.  Okie characterises Ralph's historical point of view as \"country party.\"  While that would usually equate to \"tory\" in the 1740s, Ralph wrote from the point of view of someone outside London, someone without an interest in affairs of court.  His history is superior to Rapin's London-bound history and addressed economic history for the first time in English historiography (Okie 875).  Ralph points out the corruption and absurdity of all the courtiers and Parliamentarians who had acted out of self-interest.  Also in 1744, Ralph wrote The Use and Abuse of Parliaments in two volumes.  These two vast works of history were remarkable feats of prolixity.  This work was another somewhat cynical view of the history of Parliament in the 17th century."]}, {"page": "1707 in Great Britain", "response": ["* John Oldmixon, The Muses Mercury; or, The Monthly Miscellany, published monthly from January of this year to January 1708"]}, {"page": "1742 in poetry", "response": ["* July 9 \u2013 John Oldmixon (born 1673), English historian, pamphleteer, poet and critic"]}, {"page": "1710 in poetry", "response": ["* October \u2013 The Medley, a literary periodical, first issued; founded by Arthur Maynwaring, contributors included Richard Steele, John Oldmixon; weekly to August, 1711"]}, {"page": "1742 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 9 July \u2013 John Oldmixon, historian (born 1673)"]}, {"page": "1673 in England", "response": ["* John Oldmixon, historian (died 1742)"]}, {"page": "Zachary Grey", "response": ["In 1723, Grey also began countering historians whose accounts of the Civil War praised the Republican side.

His most consistent opponent, however, was Daniel Neal, and Grey wrote a series of pamphlets from 1723 - 1739 attacking Neal.  He also countered Sir Isaac Newton's work with Examination of the 14th chapter of Sir Isaac Newton's observations upon the prophecies of Daniel.  Grey showed the shallowness of Newton's biblical scholarship and accused him of Arianism.  Finally, in 1744 Grey's A Review of Mr. Daniel Neal's History of the Puritans concluded the battle with Neal.
