Jones mainly campaigned in the run up to the election against potential downgrading of services at Ysbyty Llandudno hospital (as well as against the proposed Gwynt-y-M\u00f4r off-shore windfarmhttp://www.npower-renewables.com/gwyntymor/ and for affordable housing).

The article reviews whether the IWA's work was accurate and whether it had a positive impact. It found that the resulting Entrepreneurship Action Plan (EAP) for Wales had a \"profound\" impact, but that its removal years later was a severe mistake along with the abolition of the Welsh Development Agency. It praises the appointment of a new Minister for the Economy within the Welsh Government in 2011 but notes that the Labour-Plaid coalition's 2010 Economic Renewal Programme only briefly mentioned entrepreneurship once in 53 pages. It notes that a positive trend continues in Welsh business, as \"new firm formation has been increasing again in Wales for the period 2011\u201313, growing by 38% as compared to 33 % for the UK.\" At an IWA conference reported by the BBC however, Baron Rowe-Beddoe argued that Welsh investment planning could not be \"simply a throw-back to the WDA, which had run its course.\""]}]}}
