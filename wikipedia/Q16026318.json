He became a private secretary to a Liberal MP before travelling to North America to perform clerical work on ranches.Upon returning to England he joined the Fabian Society (in March 1891), being at this time a socialist. During the next two years he was a speaker for the Society in London and in April 1893 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the Society. However he dissented from the majority of the Committee in that he supported the proposal for the Society to unite with the Social Democratic Federation and the Socialist League. He therefore resigned from the Committee in July 1894.", "link_mentions": {}}}
