Because of his determination to create art according to his own principles rather than those of his patrons, he is also noted for being one of the earliest romantic painters working in Britain, though as an artist few rated him highly until the fully comprehensive 1983 exhibition at the Tate Gallery led to a reassessment of this \"notoriously belligerent personality\", who emerges as one of the most important Irish c artists. He was also a profound influence on William Blake.", "link_mentions": {}}}
