Tull made his debut four days later against Watford, and made 111 first-team appearances (105 in the League), scoring nine goals for the club.

He made his debut for the club two months into the 1921\u201322 season, replacing captain Charlie Brittain in a 2\u20130 victory over West Bromwich Albion on 29 October. He retained his place for Cardiff's following match, a 2\u20130 defeat to Manchester City on 5 November, but these proved to be the only senior appearances in his first season. The following year, Nelson again started the campaign as a reserve, with Brittain and Jack Page being preferred in Nelson's favoured position. He made only one appearance during the first half of the season, but was recalled for a goalless draw with Bolton Wanderers on 30 December 1922. Nelson retained his place for the rest of the season, missing only 4 of the remaining 19 matches and finishing the campaign with 24 appearances in all competitions.

Former Cardiff player Charlie Brittain had successfully ran in previous years and was already serving on the council. He again made more than 35 appearances during the campaign and, in the 1923\u201324 season, he missed only two matches as Cardiff finished second in the First Division. The latter season was also his most prolific goalscoring campaign for the club, netting four times over the year.

They finished the season in 10th place and results improved even more in the 1914\u201315 season as they achieved third place in the First Division. The progress under Stewart was put on hold soon after as the First World War broke out. Numerous first team players left the club to serve, but Stewart was instrumental in the founding of a wartime league and was able to organise a team to compete. When the Southern League resumed in 1919, Stewart was able to call upon the majority of his former players and led the club to a fourth-placed finish."]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Manager Fred Stewart remained in charge for his ninth season of competitive football. Confidence in the existing squad from Stewart and the club's board meant there was little transfer activity ahead of the new season. In a board meeting prior to the campaign a director of Cardiff was quoted as declaring the club were \"envied by nearly all the other League clubs\" in regards to the players contracted to the club. The decision to rely on the existing squad was described as \"thoroughly justified\" during the early stages of the campaign. The club's squad was regarded as largely youthful with only four players over the age of 30. Stewart continued his tradition of sourcing players from the North of England by signing forward Alfie Hagan and winghalf Harry Wake from Newcastle United's reserve side and goalkeeper William Robb from Wallsend Boys Club. The only significant departure saw club captain Charlie Brittain leave after deciding to retire from football having lost his place in the side to Jimmy Nelson.

The team were drawn against First Division side Chelsea, who would be playing their eighth match in the competition, having been taken to two replays by both Reading and Plymouth Argyle in the first and third rounds respectively. Chelsea's difficulty in overcoming opponents in the previous rounds meant that the match was seen as a closer contest than the divisional gap suggested. A crowd of 50,000 attended the match at Ninian Park. After Cardiff took an early lead through Cashmore's second goal in the competition, they proceeded to defend resolutely throughout the remainder of the match, holding their lead for the rest of the game.
