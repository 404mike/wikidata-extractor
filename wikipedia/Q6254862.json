The poet Robert Southey was one of his friends.\nFrom 1799 to 1801 he edited the Commercial, Agricultural, and Manufactures' Magazine which published his article \"On ascertaining the population\" in 1800. An earlier version of this paper entitled \"Thoughts on the Utility and Facility of a general enumeration of the People of the British Empire\". Rickman, was living at Burton in Christchurch, in 1792, when he first published \u2018Thoughts on the Utility and Facility . . . etc\u2019. It was Christchurch\u2019s MP George Rose who raised this in Parliament with the speaker Lord Colchester Charles Abbot, leading in 1800 to the Bill \u2018An Act for taking an Account of the Population of Great Britain\u2019. Shortly after, in 1800, Abbot appointed Rickman his Private Secretary.\nRickman is credited with drafting the first bill which became the 1800 Census Act, the full title of which was An Act for taking an Account of the Population of Great Britain, and of the Increase or Diminution thereof, which became law in December 1800. Rickman was instrumental in carrying out the first four censuses of Great Britain, including not only a population count, but also the collection and analysis of parish register returns.\nFollowing Abbot's election to the post of Speaker of the House of Commons in February 1802, Rickman took the post of Speaker's Secretary, which he held until July 1814 when he was appointed Second Clerk Assistant at the Table of the House of Commons. In this capacity he drove through a substantial reform to the way in which the House of Commons recorded and published its daily proceedings: the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons were first published on 18 April 1817, replacing the Votes of the House of Commons, first published in the 1680s.\nRickman became Clerk Assistant in 1820, a post which he held to his death. It is often stated that Rickman was Clerk of the House of Commons: this was never the case.\nRickman served as Secretary to two Parliamentary Commissions established in 1803. The first for the making of roads and bridges in Scotland; the second for the construction of the Caledonian Canal through Scotland's Great Glen. The civil engineer Thomas Telford was amongst the commissioners on both these Commissions:  John Rickman was a close friend of Telford, and was his executor, as well as the editor of Telford's autobiography.Besides Rickman's work on the census, he also collected and mustered other statistics. Between 1816 and 1836 he abstracted the poor rate returns for the Poor Law Committee; later he produced returns on Education for Lord John Russell's Education Committee and in 1839 he compiled a return of Local Taxation. In April 1815 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.The subtitle to Orlo William's biography of Rickman: Lamb's Friend the Census Taker under-emphasises his extensive parliamentary work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Southey", "response": ["In 1819, through a mutual friend (John Rickman), Southey met the leading civil engineer Thomas Telford and struck up a friendship.

This was published in 1929 as Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819. He was also a friend of the Dutch poet Willem Bilderdijk, whom he met twice, in 1824 and 1826, at Bilderdijk's home in Leiden.

Government official John Rickman became instrumental in the carrying out of the first modern British census in 1801, under Pitt's administration.

Information was collected by census enumerators who were usually the local Overseers of the Poor or (in Scotland) schoolmasters. They visited individual households and gathered the required information, before submitting statistical summaries. The details of households and individuals were important only in creating these local summaries and were destroyed in all but a few cases.

In the first sequence of 30 letters written to Coleridge he minutely criticises his friend's poems, advising him to abandon conventional poetic diction and \"cultivate simplicity\". The influence he exercised on his friend is seen as crucial in preparing Coleridge for the Romantic revolution that he and Wordsworth launched two years later in their Lyrical Ballads. Almost from the beginning the letters show Lamb's sense of duty to his family and friends, but after a few years, without abandoning his moral convictions, Lamb found a lighter means of expression. In an 1801 letter he wrote, \"I have had a time of seriousness, and I have known the importance and reality of a religious belief. Latterly, I acknowledge, much of my seriousness has gone off\u2026but I still retain at bottom a conviction of the truth, and a certainty of the usefulness of religion.\" In the later letters it is often possible to see Lamb forming and developing the ideas that he later presented in fully matured form in the Essays of Elia and other magazine pieces, and in this way they proved to be essential to his career as a published writer."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Hertford College, Oxford", "response": ["* John Rickman, statistician "]}, {"page": "Ronald Hargreaves", "response": ["As well as his work on selection, Hargreaves also participated in work on neuroses.
