In the 1931\u20131932 season, he played football for Coventry City, where he was a capable defender, but did not play again for them for several years. In the summer of 1932 he began his cricketing career at Derbyshire where he was an opening batsman and fine close fielder.\nElliott's first spell for Derbyshire lasted from 1932 to 1937 and he played for the side that won the County Championship in 1936. Because of a financial crisis at the club he was released and became a professional for Stourbridge. At the start of the Second World War he joined the Coventry Fire Brigade, and was on the roof of Coventry Cathedral during the blitz which destroyed it.After the war, he played again for Derbyshire and he scored 1,000 runs in six consecutive seasons from 1947 to 1952. In total he played 468 innings in 275 matches with nine centuries and an average of 27.25. His best score was 215 against Nottinghamshire in 1947, when he shared a stand of 349 with John Eggar. In bowling he took eleven wickets at an average of 47.81 and a best performance of 2\u201325. He also played football for Coventry City again in the 1947\u201348 season bringing his Football League appearances total 95. He was caretaker-manager for Coventry for six months in 1954\u201355.\nElliott served as a first-class umpire from 1956 to 1974. He umpired in 42 Tests between 1957 and 1974 and in five One Day Internationals between 1972 and 1974. He served on the England Test selection panel from 1975 to 1981, and was President of Derbyshire in 1993 and 1994.\nElliott was in Melbourne when the Third Test of the 1970\u201371 Ashes series was washed out. He was asked to award the Man of the Match award in the first ever One Day International, arranged at the last minute to replace the Test, and gave it to John Edrich for his top-scoring 82 as \"without John's 82 there'd have been no match\".A dapper man with immaculately groomed black hair, which he retained into old age, he died at Nottingham, where he had kept a guest house, eight years short of his century.\nElliott was the nephew of Harry Elliott, the Derbyshire and England Test wicketkeeper and played alongside his uncle in pre-Second World War games and in 1947, when Harry reappeared in four matches at the age of 55 because of a Derbyshire injury crisis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bolsover", "response": ["* Charlie Elliott MBE \u2013 English cricketer"]}, {"page": "St James's Palace Stakes", "response": ["| Charlie Elliott", "| Charlie Elliott"]}, {"page": "Ken Barrington", "response": ["Doug Insole used his influence to have Barrington join himself, Alec Bedser, Charlie Elliott and Sir Len Hutton as a selector for the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), which chose the England cricket team.

From 1926, the nucleus of a good team emerged around some doughty batting from Denis Smith, Stan Worthington and George Pope. Pope's bowling and that of his brother Alf, leg spinner Tommy Mitchell and seam bowler Bill Copson took the team to their one and so far only Championship victory in 1936. They won 13 of their 28 matches outright and five on first innings. Worthington, Les Townsend, Smith and Alderman all passed 1,000 runs and Copson and Mitchell took over 100 wickets, with Alf Pope taking 94. Charlie Elliott, who later became a Test umpire and selector, was another member of this team which was captained by AW Richardson."]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["The Australians chose to bat first, and Brown top scored with 140, his first 50 taking three hours. He shared century stands with Bradman, who made 62, and Miller (57). Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away late in the innings, losing 7/142. Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57, while Miller, Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece. The county followed on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs. In their second innings they made 182, with Denis Smith making 88, the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians. However, only one other player reached double figures, as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9/72, taking 6/77, while Loxton took 3/16.

He quickly took over as wicketkeeper from George Beet. He continued playing for Derbyshire every year until 1939, and was a member of the team when the club won the County Championship in 1936. He played in four Tests for England which were against South Africa in 1927/8, against the West Indies in 1928 and twice against India in 1933/4.
