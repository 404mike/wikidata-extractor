In 1910 he became a member of the London County Council as a member of the British House of Commons. Upon the death of his grandfather ten years later, Ponsonby succeeded as Earl of Bessborough and took his seat in the House of Lords. In 1931 he was appointed as Governor-General by King George V, on the recommendation of British prime minister Ramsay MacDonald, to replace The Earl of Willingdon as viceroy.  He occupied the post until succeeded by The Lord Tweedsmuir in 1935. Lord Bessborough is remembered for promoting new communication technologies as well as giving support to Canadians during the Great Depression.\nAfter the end of his viceregal tenure, he returned to London, where he continued in business and worked with the Dominions Office and the Foreign Office before his death in March 1956.\nThe 9th Lord Bessborough was the last Earl of Bessborough to own Bessborough House, the Ponsonby family's ancestral seat near the village of Piltown in the south of County Kilkenny in Ireland. The country house was primarily built in the 1740s for the 1st Earl. It was gutted by fire during the Irish Civil War in February 1923. The 9th Lord Bessborough had the house rebuilt in the late 1920s. However, he sold the house in the late 1930s as he primarily lived in Britain. The house now forms the central part of Kildalton Agricultural College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce", "response": ["* Bessborough: Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough, 14th Governor General of Canada"]}, {"page": "List of governors general of Canada", "response": ["| Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough(1880\u20131956)"]}, {"page": "1880 in Canada", "response": ["*October 27 \u2013 Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough, businessman, politician and Governor General of Canada (d.1956)"]}, {"page": "1931 in Canada", "response": ["* Governor General \u2013 Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon (until April 4) then Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough"]}, {"page": "1932 in Canada", "response": ["* Governor General \u2013 Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough "]}, {"page": "1934 in Canada", "response": ["* Governor General \u2013 Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough "]}, {"page": "1935 in Canada", "response": ["* Governor General \u2013 Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough (until November 2) then John Buchan "]}, {"page": "1956 in Canada", "response": ["*March 10 \u2013 Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough, businessman, politician and Governor General of Canada (b.1880)"]}, {"page": "1933 in Canada", "response": ["* Governor General \u2013 Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough "]}]}}
