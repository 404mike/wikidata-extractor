Arnos Grove tube station and the former Murphy Radio factory in Welwyn Garden City are regarded as some of his best work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Holden", "response": ["For Arnos Grove station, one of eight new stations on the northern extension of the line, Holden modified the rectangular box into a circular drum, a design inspired by Gunnar Asplund's Stockholm Public Library. Also notable on the northern extension is Southgate station; here Holden designed a single-storey circular building with a canopied flat roof. Above this, the central section of roof rises up on a continuous horizontal band of clerestory windows, supported internally by a single central column. The building is topped by an illuminated feature capped with a bronze ball. Other stations show the influence of Willem Marinus Dudok's work in Hilversum, Netherlands. In order to handle such a large volume of work, Holden delegated significant design responsibility to his assistants, such as Charles Hutton, who took the lead on Arnos Grove Station. For some other Piccadilly line stations the design was handled in-house by Stanley Heaps or by other architectural practices. All followed the modern brick, glass and concrete house style defined by Holden, but some lacked Holden's originality and attention to detail; Pick dubbed these \"Holdenesque\"."]}, {"page": "Arnos Grove tube station", "response": ["Like the other stations Charles Holden designed for the extension, Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick, glass and reinforced concrete and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels rises from a low single-storey structure and is capped by a flat concrete slab roof. The design was said to be inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund,, although Charles Hutton, Holden's chief assistant stated Holden based the idea on a groundsman's lodge at Midhurst Sanatorium designed by Adams, Holden, and Pearson in 1904\u20131906. The centre of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line. The original design by Holden was detailed by Charles Hutton, who also had to amend the construction method from Sudbury Town tube station due to issues with leaking shuttering for the concrete roof discolouring the brickwork."]}, {"page": "Architectural Association School of Architecture", "response": ["*Charles Hutton"]}, {"page": "Bellahouston Academy", "response": ["*Charles Hutton - architect and former Master of the Art Workers' Guild "]}, {"page": "Charles Hutton (disambiguation)", "response": ["Charles Hutton may refer to:", "* Charles Hutton, mathematician", "* Charles Hutton (architect)", "* Charles Hutton (politician), Canadian politician", "* Charles Hutton Gregory, civil engineer"]}]}}
