They famously defeated professional side and Latvian champions Skonto 2\u20131 on aggregate to advance to the second qualifying round. It was their first win in European competition since 1974. The second qualifying round first leg match was played at Shamrock Park on 15 July 2010, with Richard Lecky scoring the opening goal against Azerbaijani champions FK Qaraba\u011f, but two second-half goals from Afran Ismayilov saw the away side take a 2\u20131 lead back home for the second leg on 22 July. The second leg in Baku ended 1\u20131 with The Ports taking the lead through a free-kick from Kevin Braniff. Despite an effort against the Azerbaijani champions, it was not enough for The Ports to progress to the next round and they were eliminated 3\u20132 on aggregate.", "The 2013\u201314 season was a largely frustrating one of what might have been, with Gary Twigg playing a valuable part and scoring regularly, along with in-form young striker Darren Murray and some of Kevin Braniff's moments of sheer class displayed at times and the skill of Peter McMahon. The club showed form at times capable of winning the league by beating rivals Glenavon comfortably and notably beating Ballinamallard United 11\u20130. However, poor results against teams lower in the table meant they finished only fourth, and a falling-out between striker Kevin Braniff and Ronnie McFall resulted in the former leaving the club and moving to Australian side Port Melbourne.", "The following season, Tipton would seek to shape the Portadown squad to his liking, making a total of 16 signings notably Kevin Braniff and Johnny Flynn on free transfers from Ballymena United, former players Darren Murray and Sean Mackle returned to the club from Crusaders and Warrenpoint Town respectively. hat particular season the Ports were challenged in a big way by Larne F.C., who were now subject to significant investment and were favourites to win the NIFL Championship in 2019. The first ten games of the season would see the Ports notch up 5 wins, 4 draws and 1 defeat in what was a fairly respectable return from the opening part of the season that saw them score 19 points out of a possible 30. As the season progressed, they often failed to pick up points away from home that saw them ultimately finish in third place behind Larne and Carrick Rangers with the latter overcoming the men in red in a promotion playoff which the Gers won 2\u20130."]}, {"page": "Eoin Bradley", "response": ["After a successful top-flight debut campaign, scoring 12 goals in 27 games for the Bannsiders, Bradley moved to newly-crowned Irish Cup winners Glenavon in the summer of 2014. Bradley formed an effective forward partnership with fellow summer arrival Kevin Braniff, scoring 13 and 15 goals respectively in the 2014\u201315 NIFL Premiership, as the Lurgan club finished third. Further success was to follow in the 2015-16 season, with Bradley scoring 17 goals in the league and Glenavon once again claiming the Irish Cup."]}, {"page": "Kevin braniff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kevin Braniff"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 IFA Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Kevin Braniff"]}, {"page": "2011 Setanta Sports Cup", "response": ["*  Kevin Braniff (Portadown)"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 IFA Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Kevin Braniff"]}, {"page": "2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 6", "response": ["* Kevin Braniff"]}, {"page": "2012 Setanta Sports Cup", "response": ["*  Kevin Braniff (Portadown)"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 NIFL Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Kevin Braniff"]}, {"page": "Braniff (name)", "response": ["*Kevin Braniff (born 1983), Northern Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Millwall F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|22||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Kevin Braniff"]}]}}
