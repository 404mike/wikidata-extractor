The Chelsea Barracks bombing in London in October 1981 killed two civilians and injured twenty-three soldiers; a week later the IRA struck again in London by an assassination attempt on Lieutenant General Steuart Pringle, the Commandant General Royal Marines. Attacks on military targets in England continued with the Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings in July 1982, which killed eleven soldiers and injured over fifty people including civilians. In October 1984 they carried out the Brighton hotel bombing, an assassination attempt on British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, whom they blamed for the deaths of the ten hunger strikers. The bombing killed five members of the Conservative Party attending a party conference including MP Anthony Berry, with Thatcher narrowly escaping death. A planned escalation of the England bombing campaign in 1985 was prevented when six IRA volunteers, including Martina Anderson and the Brighton bomber Patrick Magee, were arrested in Glasgow. Plans for a major escalation of the campaign in the late 1980s were cancelled after a ship carrying 150 tonnes of weapons donated by Libya was seized off the coast of France. The plans, modelled on the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War, relied on the element of surprise which was lost when the ship's captain informed French authorities of four earlier shipments of weapons, which allowed the British Army to deploy appropriate countermeasures. In 1987 the IRA began attacking British military targets in mainland Europe, beginning with the Rheindahlen bombing, which was followed by approximately twenty other gun and bomb attacks aimed at British Armed Forces personnel and bases between 1988 and 1990."]}, {"page": "Sherborne School", "response": ["Notable Old Shirburnians in the military include commander in chief Naval Home Command Admiral Sir Horace Law, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Admiral Sir James Perowne, Field Marshal Sir Claud Jacob, commander of 6th Airlanding Brigade during the Rhine Crossing Brigadier Hugh Bellamy, World War One flying ace Captain Keith Muspratt, Battle of Britain flying ace Flight Lieutenant Carl Raymond Davis, commander in chief India, Governor of Gibraltar General Sir Charles Monro, Master-General of the Ordnance General Sir Jeremy Blacker, commander in chief Land Command General Sir John Wilsey, commander in chief Land Command and deputy commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan General Sir Nicholas Parker, developer of machine gun tactics and Conservative MP Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Applin, CEO of Aegis Defence Services Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Spicer, director general of the European Union Military Staff in the Council of the European Union, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod Lieutenant General David Leakey, Commandant General Royal Marines Lieutenant General Sir Martin Garrod, Commandant General Royal Marines Lieutenant General Sir Steuart Pringle, commander of Royal Marines in the Falklands War Major General Julian Thompson, overall British commander in the Gulf War Major General Patrick Cordingley, Major-General Commanding the Household Division and General Officer Commanding London District, Major General Sir Iain Mackay-Dick, commander of British Forces in Hong Kong Major General Sir Roy Redgrave, and Deputy Commander Operation Inherent Resolve Major General Rupert Jones (British Army officer)."]}, {"page": "45 Commando", "response": ["*1971\u20131974 Lt Col Sir Steuart Pringle Bt RM"]}, {"page": "Jeremy Moore", "response": ["Moore commanded the Royal Marines School of Music from 1973 to 1975, and then studied at the Royal College of Defence Studies in 1976.
