He was one of three players, the others being Scott Borthwick and Boyd Rankin, to make their debuts in the 5th Test. In the first innings he made 18 runs after coming in with the score at 17/4 and helped England to 155 all out. Test Match Special commentator Geoffrey Boycott acknowledged that Ballance was incredibly unlucky to be dismissed, receiving a corker that pitched in the footmarks. In the second innings he made 7 runs finishing the series with 25 runs. Ballance's next call-up was against Australia during the England tour of Australia.  In the 1st ODI, at the MCG, Ballance top scored for England, making 79 runs off 96 balls. However this was not enough to help England win as Australia cruised to a 6 wicket win. Ballance kept his place for the 2nd ODI however he managed only 9 runs off 19 balls before being stumped by Brad Haddin. In the 3rd ODI Ballance batted at number 4 and made 26 runs off 42 balls. He retained his place for the 4th ODI and made 18 runs off 30 balls before being caught.
