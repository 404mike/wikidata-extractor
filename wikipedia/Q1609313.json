He gained further experience at Doxford's marine engineering works in Sunderland and later as an inspector for Sir Charles Fox and Sir Alexander Rendel. Garratt joined the Argentine Central Railway in 1889, where he became Locomotive Superintendent in 1892, and between 1900 and 1906 he worked for railways in Cuba, Lagos, and Lima (Peru). In 1902, Garratt was elected to membership of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. He returned to England in 1906, taking on a role inspecting locomotives built for the New South Wales Government Railways by British manufacturers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of mechanical engineers", "response": ["* Herbert William Garratt (1864\u20131913) \u2013 inventor of the Garratt system of articulated locomotives"]}, {"page": "Garratt", "response": ["A Garratt (often referred to as a Beyer Garratt) is a type of steam locomotive invented by British engineer Herbert William Garratt that is articulated into three parts.

At the time, he was the New South Wales Railways' inspecting engineer in London following a career with British colonial railways. Garratt first approached Kitson & Co with his design, but his idea was rejected, perhaps because that company were already committed to the Kitson-Meyer articulated design. He then approached Beyer, Peacock and Company, which were only marginally more interested."]}, {"page": "1864 in rail transport", "response": ["* June 8 \u2013 Herbert William Garratt, English steam locomotive builder and inventor of the Garratt locomotive type (d. 1913)."]}, {"page": "1909 in rail transport", "response": ["* September 17 - Beyer, Peacock and Company of Manchester, England, steam the first Garratt articulated steam locomotive built to the design of Herbert William Garratt, K1 for the North East Dundas Tramway."]}, {"page": "1913 in rail transport", "response": ["* September 25 - Herbert William Garratt, English steam locomotive builder and inventor of the Garratt locomotive type (born 1864).(April 27, 2004), Herbert William Garratt.

After the patents ran out in 1928, the company began to use the name \"Beyer-Garratt\" to distinguish their locomotives. They became widely used throughout Africa, South America, Asia, Australia and the South Pacific, where difficult terrain and lightly laid, tightly curved track, usually narrow-gauge, severely limited the weight and power output of conventional locomotives. In Garratt's design, two girders holding a boilerSignificant in the performance of the boiler, hence power output, was that the Garratt's firebox was no longer confined to the narrow space between a locomotive's frame but was constrained only by the much greater distance between girders. and a cab were slung between two \"engine\" units, each with cylinders, wheels and motion. The weight of the locomotive was therefore spread over a considerable distance. Both engine units were topped by water tanks.
