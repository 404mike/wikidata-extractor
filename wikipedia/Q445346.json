Miss Terry is a thriller dealing with issues about the children of immigrant families in modern Britain. Cody's novels have been widely translated.\nCody's short stories have appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines and a lavishly praised collection of her first seventeen was published as Lucky Dip and other stories.\nMost of Cody's work is set in London.

The series was produced by Brian Eastman, in conjunction with Carnival Films for London Weekend Television.", "Notably, despite all six episodes being adapted from their parent books, considerable alterations were made for television, much to the dismay of writer Liza Cody. Reportedly, this prompted Cody to abandon writing any further Anna Lee books; as she had previously signed a contract with LWT to allow for any further books to be adapted for television. However, despite much detail being removed for the television adaptations, LWT's most notable contribution to series was the casting of Brian Glover; like his character Selwyn Price, Glover was an ex-professional wrestler, and his room full of wrestling posters seen in the series were in fact real posters featuring Leon Arras, the name Glover used when wrestling."]}, {"page": "Cody (surname)", "response": ["*Liza Cody (born 1944), British author"]}, {"page": "CWA New Blood Dagger", "response": ["*1980 \u2013\tLiza Cody, Dupe"]}, {"page": "Betty Webb", "response": ["The \u2018Desert\u2019 series features Scottsdale-based private eye Lena Jones, a former policewoman.
