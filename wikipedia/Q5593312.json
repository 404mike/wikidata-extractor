However, none has endured to the same extent. In the 1980s the broadcaster Mike Read presented a similar slot during his tenure as host of The Radio 1 Breakfast Show titled First Love. Here, listeners' stories of the first time they fell in love would be read out over The Love Unlimited Orchestra's instrumental piece Love's Theme. While presenting his weeknight programme on Birmingham's BRMB in the early 1990s, Graham Torrington had a similar feature as part of his The Love Zone strand. Radio 1's The Jo Whiley Show and Fearne Cotton both had a segment called Changing Tracks where listeners were invited to email requests for a song that reminded them of a time in their life when music changed everything. The theme music from Our Tune appears in Act II of the 1998 British musical Boogie Nights. Our Tune also featured as one of the items on a 1994 edition of the BBC satirical television series Room 101. Guest Tony Slattery included it among his list of banished items."]}, {"page": "The One Network", "response": ["* Late Night Love (1995-2008) a phone-in show presented by Graham Torrington."]}, {"page": "Heart Dunstable", "response": ["Past presenters included Mark Smith, Philippa Collins, Paul McKenna, Graham Torrington, Dale Winton, NJ Williams, Martin Collins, Jeremy Beadle and Chris Moyles."]}, {"page": "Buzz FM", "response": ["Under Cary, Lindsay Reid was Chief Engineer, Alistar Cochrane was Head Of Sales and Head Of News and Features was Sybil Fennell - well known for her longstanding work with London news station LBC. Birmingham native John Ryan was brought in from local radio in Ireland to present the breakfast show and by the middle of 1993 the financial losses were under control and Buzz FM started to go into profit. At this time Buzz FM sounded like a very slick, commercial and vibrant station in a radio market that was becoming increasingly competitive. But once again problems with reception were causing issues for its long term success. There were several management shake-ups, and Buzz was even sold on to the businessman Muff Murfin in 1993. However, audience figures and revenue failed to improve significantly. Not even the recruitment of some former BRMB presenters (including Brendan Kearney and Graham Torrington) helped to improve the station's fortunes, and the end finally came in 1994."]}, {"page": "Smooth North East", "response": ["*Graham Torrington"]}, {"page": "Chiltern Radio Network", "response": ["Original DJs and presenters included Paul McKenna, Paul 'Mad Dog' O'Reilly, Martin Collins, Tony West, NJ Williams, Tony Lloyd, and Louie Martin.
