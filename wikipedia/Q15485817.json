He disparaged poems that relied on \"shared classical and literary allusions \u2013 what he called the myth-kitty, and the poems are never cluttered with elaborate imagery.\"Jean Sprackland, speaking on The Whitsun Weddings BBC Radio Four, 1 December 2013   Larkin's mature poetic persona is notable for its \"plainness and scepticism\".

Larkin's letters  mention two journeys, one to Grantham (not at Whit, some weddings), and one to London (not at Whit, no weddings), that may have been conflated in the poem.
