Opponents Peru's impressive credentials went overlooked and were not expected to provide many problems in the first match. Peru, however, won the game 3\u20131. Scotland took the lead but Don Masson missed a penalty and in general failed to play to their potential. Before the match journalist James McKillop had written in The Glasgow Herald that \"The suggestion that we might not win is unthinkable and can be dismissed out of hand.\" As MacLeod himself put it, the performance against Peru was \"rank bad\". Plentiful excuses emerged: there had been a dispute concerning bonuses, the hotel swimming pool had no water in it, there was nothing for the players to do. It was then revealed that the winger Willie Johnston had taken a cold tablet which contained a banned stimulant fencamfamine (Reactivan). He was sent home. MacLeod, at a press conference, saw a mongrel dog approach: \"I think he is the only friend I have got left\", he said, stretching out a hand."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Sirrel", "response": ["From previous managers Jack Wheeler and Billy Gray, Sirrel had inherited a team including Don Masson, David Needham, Bob Worthington and Les Bradd, and his team would become increasingly difficult to beat.

Including a new generation of players bought in by Sirrel and the returning Don Masson, the Magpies would finish the season in second place, and a 2\u20130 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge confirmed that the Magpies would be playing First Division football for the first time since 1926."]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Archie Gemmill, Kenny Dalglish, Don Masson", "|Don Masson, Kenny Dalglish"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Andy Gray (2), Eddie Gray, Kenny Dalglish, Bruce Rioch, Don Masson (pen.)", "|Don Masson"]}]}}
