However the institution itself goes as far back to its foundation as Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts in 1823, making its claim in the third oldest university in England debate. In 1994, John Moores, Jr, CBE, DL, who was the eldest son of Sir John Moores whom the university is named after, and who served as chair of governors, was appointed second chancellor until the end of his term in 1999.  It is a non-residential appointment. The leadership and everyday running of the university is installed in the Vice-Chancellor, who is the chief executive. During the absence of the chancellor or vacant office, the duties are often undertaken by the Pro-Chancellor, who is also the chairman of the board of governors. Upon completing the term of office or stepping down, the holder is appointed Chancellor Emeritus of the university, retaining an informal ambassadorial position."]}, {"page": "Vere Egerton Cotton", "response": ["He is the father of Henry Egerton Cotton, Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside."]}]}}
