In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was \"America's favorite building\". The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants.

Hauser characterised him as \"a very British combination of a snob and a rebel\", also noting that he was \"no great intellectual\". Similarly, Clark expressed the view that \"Crawford's achievements\" stemmed from his \"moral integrity and singleness of mind\" rather than \"any outstanding intellectual brilliance\". The journalist Neal Ascherson described Crawford as \"not conventionally intellectual\". Ascherson added that Crawford was \"withdrawn, generally ill at ease with other members of the human species except on paper, and suspicious of personal celebrity\", in this way contrasting Crawford with his \"gregarious\" contemporaries Wheeler and Daniel."]}, {"page": "USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)", "response": ["When it first appeared on television, the Enterprise was called an \"elegant and weird looking behemoth\". Design expert Jonathan Glancey described the \"convincing and exciting\" Enterprise as having the same aesthetic appeal as the Concorde jet, B-17 bomber, and Queen Elizabeth 2 ocean liner. The ship's design came at the end of a trend for science-fiction spaceships to resemble rockets, and just as real spacecraft began to influence sci-fi designs. The Enterprises design, which influenced future starships in the franchise, is iconic. The ship's interiors are also considered exemplars of 1960s design. Popular Mechanics called the design of the original Enterprise the best version of the various ships named Enterprise that had appeared in the Star Trek franchise. io9 also ranked the original design of the ship as the best version of the Enterprise, characterizing the original as superior to ten later versions of its namesake, and ranked the film refit as the franchise's second best.

Flight crews derided the new designs as \"Air Zulu.\" Jonathan Glancey criticized the Utopia project as \"muddle-headed and messy - ethnic designs turned into the equivalent of doll's-house wallpaper, things applied but not belonging\", failing to give the airline a cohesive identity. Glancey added the ethnic designs \"had the net effect of trivializing art and design from around the world\", comparing their display to the patronizing attitude of the colonial era British Empire. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher showed her displeasure at the designs by covering one of the new tailfins (Animals and Trees) on a model 747 with tissue paper. She declared, \"We fly the British flag, not these awful things\" in 1997. Thatcher also indicated with these fins the airline would lose its identity.
