However, although his career spanned the years 1832 to 1847, he was only an occasional player who took part in just 8 games. As a batsman, Denison scored a mere 34 runs, with a high score of 12 and average of 3.77. He was more successful as a bowler, taking 30 wickets at an average of 12.41, with best figures of 6-72. He was apparently the first player brave enough to bowl slow roundarm deliveries in important matches, for which he acquired the nickname \"Stick 'em up\" Denison.Denison is best known for being the first Honorary Secretary of Surrey County Cricket Club when it was founded in 1845, remaining in the position until 1848. He made one first-class appearance for the county, in their inaugural match, against MCC on 25\u201326 May 1846.He was a cricket reporter for nearly 25 years, and a regular columnist for The Era newspaper in London. He wrote for The Times in the 1840s and was also on the staff of The Sporting Magazine. Between 1844 and 1847 he produced an annual publication called The Cricketer's Companion, which provided a summary of the previous season's play. He also wrote the book, Cricket: Sketches of the Players (1846), reflecting his involvement with the All-England Eleven team.Denison died near Blackheath in London on 9 December 1856, it being noted in the press that he would be \"[r]emembered in life for his many amiable and excellent qualities, which endeared him to a large circle of friends\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Dennison", "response": ["* William Denison (1804\u20131871), British colonial official, Governor of New South Wales, 1855\u20131861, and Governor of Madras, 1861\u20131866", "* William Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough (1834\u20131900), British peer and Liberal politician", "* William Denison (cricketer) (1801\u20131856), English cricketer and cricket official"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["Surrey CCC was founded on the evening of 18 August 1845 at the Horns Tavern in Kennington, South London, where around 100 representatives of various cricket clubs in Surrey agreed a motion put by William Denison (the club's first secretary) \"that a Surrey club be now formed\".

The original AEE team was: William Clarke, Jemmy Dean, William Dorrinton, Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Joe Guy, Will Martingell, Tom Sewell, G Butler, VC Smith and William Hillyer.

Clarke's team was indeed a top-class side worthy of its title as, in 1846, it consisted of himself, Joe Guy (cricketer), George Parr (all of Nottinghamshire), William Lillywhite, Jemmy Dean (both Sussex), William Denison, Will Martingell (both Surrey), Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Wanostrocht (aka \"Felix\") and William Hillyer (all Kent). Their matches in Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds were a huge success and very profitable, especially for Clarke himself who was careful to pay his players more than Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) did (from \u00a34 to \u00a36 per week) and so keep them interested.
