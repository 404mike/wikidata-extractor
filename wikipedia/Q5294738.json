His father was Donald MacCormick, a sea captain who was from the Isle of Mull. His mother was the first district nurse in the Western Isles. MacCormick was educated at Woodside School, and studied law at the University of Glasgow (1923\u20131928). He became involved in politics while at university, and joined the Glasgow University Labour Club and the Independent Labour Party in 1923. Richard J. Finlay, 'MacCormick, John MacDonald (1904\u20131961)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press In September 1927 MacCormick left the ILP and formed the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association (GUSNA), which was designed to promote Scottish culture and nationalism and self-government. The association was sufficiently neutral to act as the honest broker between the various nationalist organisations which would merge to form the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in April 1928. MacCormick was a talented speaker and organiser, and served as the national secretary of the NPS. MacCormick was often known by his nickname \"King John\", which he said came from a heckle during a debate he was participating in when upon a question from the floor whether a devolved Scotland would retain the monarchy, or would be a republic, someone interjected and said: \"no, it will be a kingdom and John MacCormick will be our king.\"", "MacCormick married Margaret Isobel Miller in 1939, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Their elder son, Iain (1939\u20132014), served as SNP Member of Parliament for Argyll from 1974 till 1979 (and was a founder member of the Social Democratic Party.
