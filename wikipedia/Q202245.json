He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Wexford from 1918 to 1922 and 1923 to 1965, and as senator from 1965 to 1969.

Under Lemass, party elders such as James Ryan, Se\u00e1n MacEntee and Paddy Smith, retired and a new generation of politicians were introduced to government, such as Brian Lenihan, Donogh O'Malley, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. Key among this new breed of politician was Hillery, who became Minister for Education in 1959, succeeding Jack Lynch in that post."]}, {"page": "Jack Lynch", "response": ["In 1965, Lemass was once again re-elected Taoiseach. The big change was the retirement of such political heavyweights as James Ryan and Se\u00e1n MacEntee, with Lynch taking over from the former as Minister for Finance. This appointment was particularly significant because Lemass was coming to the end of his premiership and wanted to prepare a successor. As a result, Lynch took charge of the second most important position in the government, gaining widespread experience in a number of affairs, and accompanying Lemass to London to sign one of the most important trade agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. One occasion in which Lynch's authority was seen to be undermined as Minister for Finance was when the Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, announced that the government would provide free secondary school education for all. This proposal had not been discussed at Cabinet level as would be required to fund such a service. It subsequently transpired that Lemass had previously agreed the decision without cabinet discussion as was required."]}, {"page": "Se\u00e1n T.

O'Kelly publicly snubbed the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, James McNeill, by staging a public walkout at a function in the French legation in Dublin. McNeill privately wrote to \u00c9amon de Valera, the President of the Executive Council, to complain at what media reports called the \"boorishness\" of Aiken and O'Kelly's behaviour. While agreeing that the situation was \"regrettable\" de Valera, instead of chastising the ministers, suggested that the Governor-General inform the Executive Council of his social engagements to enable ministers to avoid ones he was attending. Aiken had in March 1932 been trying to reach a new rapprochement, and \"reconciled the Army to the new regime\".John Joseph Lee, Ireland: 1912-1985: Politics and Society, (Cambridge University Press, 1985), 176.
