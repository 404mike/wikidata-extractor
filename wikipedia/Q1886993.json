After the war, Fox spent six months back in London working with MacBride again, and also worked at the Marine Biological Association again for some time. However, in 1919 he returned to Cairo on invitation by Edward Hindle to join his staff at the Cairo School of Medicine as lecturer (1919\u20131923). During this time he finished a thesis on the flagellate protozoan Bodo, the research on which he had begun at Plymouth, and presented it to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to apply for fellowship. His application was accepted in 1920, but he took up the post only in 1923.

In 1895, he began demonstrating in zoology at Cambridge, and also starting investigating variation in crustaceans, under William Bateson. In 1899, he accompanied John Stanley Gardiner on an expedition to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Minikoi (Minicoy), where he studied various aspects of crustacean biology, especially the terrestrial crabs.

He gained a double first in the Natural Sciences Tripos, having read Zoology Part II. As an undergraduate he was interested in embryology and this led to him being introduced by his professor John Stanley Gardiner to E.S. Russell, whose book The Interpretation of Development and Heredity Marshall had admired. Russell at the time was Director of Fisheries Investigations at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and they discussed fish biology but Marshall was set on pursuing his interest in embryology. However, Gardiner advised Freddy to broaden his horizons and introduced him to a Commander Hawkridge who had an office insuring fishing boats in Hull. Hawkridge was able to arrange berths for Marshall on fishing boats during his vacation, which allowed Marshall to visit the waters off Iceland three times and Bear Island and the Faroes once each. It was on these voyages that Marshall was first introduced to the macrourid fish on which he would become an authority. These trips may have had some influence on Marshall's decision to give up embryology and to apply for a post as a marine biologist in Hull."]}, {"page": "Rotuman forest gecko", "response": ["The Rotuman forest gecko or Rotuma forest gecko (Lepidodactylus gardineri) is a species of gecko.
