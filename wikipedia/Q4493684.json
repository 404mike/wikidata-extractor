He represented England it seems in some wartime exhibition games. Nicknamed \"Pablo\", he played regularly after the war, and was a part of the side that won the Second Division championship in the 1948\u201349 season. A skilful, pacy player, described by Fulham and England player George Cohen as \"one of the most skillful players he ever came across, as good as Stanley Matthews\", Stevens was the third Fulham player to score 100 goals for the club, reaching a total of 124 from 413 games in all competitions, and remains (as of 2012) the club's highest scorer in the FA Cup. After playing his last game in the 1958\u201359 season, he remained with the club as a coach, and acted as caretaker manager for five weeks from mid-December 1964 to Vic Buckingham's appointment in January 1965, when Stevens left the club.During the war he served in the artillery, including at the D-Day landings; he was a part of a group giving machine-gun support to the company led by Fulham's Major Jim Tompkins in the action in which Tompkins was killed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 13", "response": ["*  1921   \u2013 Arthur Stevens, English footballer (d. 2007)"]}, {"page": "List of Fulham F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Arthur Stevens \u2013 124"]}, {"page": "List of Fulham F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Arthur Stevens"]}, {"page": "Syd Thomas", "response": ["He helped Fulham to win the Second Division title the following season but featured infrequently for the club as Arthur Stevens was moved to Thomas' preferred position to accommodate new signing Arthur Rowley in the side.
