In 1960, he appeared in Over the Bridge, a play written by Sam Thompson and directed by Jimmy Ellis. Later that year, Tuohy became the first Catholic broadcaster for BBC Northern Ireland.Tuohy moved to London in 1964 to work for the new BBC2. At the channel's launch that April, he was scheduled to be the first face on air. However, there was a power failure on the opening night, and newsreader Gerald Priestland was briefly seen before transmission was aborted and the official launch postponed until the day after. The opening broadcast began with a shot of a burning candle and Tuohy then blowing it out.Tuohy participated in several of the BBC's current affairs programmes of the 1970s, including Tonight and\nthe long-running Panorama, and, after moving to Thames Television, he presented This Week (and TV Eye, 1978\u20131986). He interviewed Margaret Thatcher in the leadup to the 1979 United Kingdom general election. Communication specialist Geoffrey Beattie analysed the interview extensively in a work on patterns of interruption in conversation.  During the 1990s, he was mainly known for his work as a reporter for ITN. He also regularly presented overnight news bulletins during the late 1990s and the early 2000s.\nAfter retiring from broadcasting, Tuohy took up acting again, playing roles in the television dramas Fair City, The Clinic, and Fallout. He also wrote a memoir, Wide-Eyed in Medialand: A Broadcaster's Journey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Family International", "response": ["* The Jesus Trip (1971), a documentary by Denis Tuohy that has interviews with Children of God members."]}, {"page": "BBC Two", "response": ["By 11:00 on 21 April, power had been restored to the studios and programming began, thus making Play School the first programme to be shown officially on the channel.

Although intended to draw attention to the considerable variety of original programming on BBC2, Line-Up was perceived as little more than a self-promotion exercise by the newspapers and the viewing public alike. Later in the same year, it was decided that Line-Up be replaced by something of a similar intention but with a more intellectual edge. Instead of a guided tour of BBC2's output, the new programme would be an open and candid discussion among invited guests, transmitted live after the 9.00 p.m. watershed. The new programme was named Late Night Line-Up and took over from Line-Up in September 1964.", "Denis Tuohy carried over his presenter's role from Line-Up but the new programme also brought Joan Bakewell to prominence as a broadcaster. An innovative feature of Late Night Line-Up was that it was deliberately scheduled as the last programme of the evening before closedown.

However, television criticism was always seen as the main focus, a fact which did not exactly endear the programme to the BBC's senior executives.
