The second phase, started after Wellington had become Prime Minister in 1828, included a new staircase and the \"Waterloo Gallery\" on the west side of the house. The red-brick exterior was clad in Bath stone, and a pedimented portico added. Wyatt's original estimate for the work was \u00a323,000, but the need to repair structural defects discovered during the work led to costs escalating to more than \u00a361,000.

With Nash and Soane he was one of the Board of Works' architects during the peak Regency period.  A large commission of the period was the expansion of Windsor Castle for the king, which eventually cost over a million pounds, over three times the original budget.  Smirke, Nash, Soane and Jeffry Wyatville were invited to tender, Wyatville winning the competition.  He was a prolific designer, mostly for country houses, new-built or refurbished, able to work in a variety of styles.
