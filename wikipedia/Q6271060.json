The scene's genesis began when Andy Gill and Jon King received a funded trip to New York City in 1976. As art students, the trip happened so that the pair could study in the city's art galleries. However, while there, they became aware of the punk rock scene that had manifested itself around CBGB. After returning to Leeds, the Sex Pistols performed at Leeds Polytechnic in December. Soon after the pair formed Gang of Four. The formation of many other groups by local art students followed, for example the Mekons, Scritti Politti, the Three Johns, Girls at Our Best! and Delta 5. Pop act Soft Cell also emerged from this cohort. The members of these bands often frequented the Fenton on Blenheim Terrace, with the most frequent venue being the F Club founded by John Keenan. Groups such as the Mekons rejected being labelled as \"bands\", instead likening themselves to an art project espousing Marxism\u2013Leninist politics. These groups also subverted many gender norms within the British punk scene, by attempting to include women as much as possible. Former Mekons and Delta 5 member Julz Sale said in Music in Leeds vol.2 that no woman \"ever felt unequal\" in the scene. During this period, members of the scene often found themselves in physical altercations against fascists, neo-Nazis and members of the National Front, leading to Leeds playing host to many Rock Against Racism concerts. In the '70s, Leeds also housed the two first openly Nazi punk bands the Dentists and the Ventz."]}, {"page": "Songs of the Free", "response": ["All songs written by Andy Gill and Jon King", "*Jon King \u2013 vocals, melodica"]}, {"page": "Yellow EP", "response": ["* Jon King - vocals"]}, {"page": "Another Day/Another Dollar", "response": ["All tracks written by Dave Allen, Hugo Burnham, Andy Gill and Jon King except as indicated.", "* Jon King - vocals"]}, {"page": "Hard (Gang of Four album)", "response": ["All tracks composed by Andy Gill and Jon King; except where indicated", "* Jon King - vocals, melodica"]}, {"page": "Shrinkwrapped (album)", "response": ["All tracks composed by Andy Gill and Jon King; except where indicated", "* Jon King - vocals"]}, {"page": "Boston (song)", "response": ["\"Boston\" is a song by American rock band Augustana, from their debut album All the Stars and Boulevards (2005).

The last two may seem too obvious, since Steve Albini is the man behind the desk for this one -- and he turns in his best, clearest sounding, deepest production since he did the first Breeders LP -- but it's not that simple. Reach back further, to some old live Gang of Four, Killing Joke, or Mekons live tape, and you might generate the precision clash of drums and bass behind atonal guitar patterns found here -- only replace Jon King or Jaz Coleman with 1978-1982 era Public Image singer Johnny Lydon, with less histrionics, and you have singer G.W.
