Bayliss joined the club as chief scout in 1931 under his predecessor Harry Storer, Jr.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["After the conclusion of World War II, league football resumed in 1946. Harry Storer was replaced as manager by Dick Bayliss, who had been his assistant, and some pre-war players, such as George Mason and Harry Barratt and goalkeeper Alf Wood, remained with the club. Another returnee was George Lowrie, who had been signed in 1939 and would go on to become the club's leading centre-forward. City finished eighth in 1946\u201347 and established a reputation for being difficult to beat. They suffered a major setback when Bayliss, who was returning from a scouting mission to Scotland, became stranded in a snowstorm in Yorkshire. He became seriously ill and died in April 1947. He was replaced by Billy Frith, who guided the club to another mid-table finish in 1947\u201348. The following season started disastrously, with City losing ten of their opening sixteen games and Frith was dismissed in November 1948. Storer was persuaded to leave Birmingham and return to Coventry, and had an instant effect with the team winning the first five games of his second spell and going on to escape relegation. This feat, following his earlier success with the club, enhanced his popularity with the club's supporters."]}, {"page": "Billy Frith", "response": ["After leaving Port Vale, Frith returned to Highfield Road as assistant to Dick Bayliss, and also played seven league games. Following Bayliss' death, Frith was appointed as manager of Coventry City in August 1947, remaining in that position until November 1948. Coventry finished the 1947\u201348 Second Division season in tenth place, and went on to end the 1948\u201349 season just two points above the relegation zone under Harry Storer's stewardship."]}]}}
