As part of his attempt to create and control a British motor industry Lawson formed and co floated The Daimler Motor Company Limited in London in 1896. It later began manufacture in Coventry.

One attempt to solve both problems with a chain-driven front wheel was the dwarf bicycle, exemplified by the Kangaroo. Inventors also tried a rear wheel chain drive. Although Harry John Lawson invented a rear-chain-drive bicycle in 1879 with his \"bicyclette\", it still had a huge front wheel and a small rear wheel.

Unlike with penny-farthings, the rider's feet were within reach of the ground, making it easier to stop. The pedals powered the rear wheel, keeping the rider's feet safely away from the front wheel. The original treadle bicycle model used treadles to transfer power to the rear wheel, while the later 1879 model used a chain drive, an important new technology that had previously only been used on tricycles. Lawson's safety failed to catch on, perhaps because of its increased cost, weight and complexity compared to the penny-farthing. One other variation that appeared at about the same time is the dwarf, exemplified by the Kangaroo, and with a chain-driven front wheel."]}, {"page": "Harry J.

He is sometimes credited with having invented the word \"motorcycle\"; he used the term as early as 1893.  Pennington built and demonstrated his original motorcycle design in Milwaukee in 1895. Apparently not finding any backers for his idea he took it to England where he sold the patents for it to Harry John Lawson's The Great Horseless Carriage Company Limited in 1896 and joined that company's board of directors.  Lawson had two more prototypes builtChadwick, Ian. \"Pennington\" (in list of) British motorcycle manufacturers P:, June 6, 2003, retrieved August 10, 2008. but nothing further came from the design. Pennington made many claims for his motorcycle, but it is doubtful if any of them are true.  The design was very primitive and a few journalists of the time expressed doubts as to whether or not it would even run, though The Autocar reported in June 1896: \"...although the motor required some little alteration, the speed developed was said to have varied from thirty to forty miles per hour.\"Holmes, Timothy A.D. \"Motorcycle Myth: Rebels without a Horse\"  International Journal of Motorcycle Studies, March 2007, retrieved on August 10, 2008.
