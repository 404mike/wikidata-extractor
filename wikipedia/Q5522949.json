The video referee gave the try 'benefit of the doubt' and Sean Long's kick didn't miss, so the score was 12 - 6 in favour of Great Britain. The Australians hit back with another long range try, the ball being moved out to Inglis on the left wing to make a break down the sideline before passing back inside to five-eighth Darren Lockyer to finish the run to the line and touch down behind the uprights. Lockyer then converted, levelling the score at 12 - 12. About ten minutes later the British struck back when Lee Gilmour hit a gap twenty metres out and ran through to dive over beneath the sticks. Sean Long converted so the Lions regained the lead at 18 - 12. With just over ten minutes remaining Great Britain got an opportunity to put themselves in front by more than a converted try when they were awarded a penalty, but Long's kick missed. Shortly after he got a chance to make amends with a drop goal but missed. However, with less than five minutes remaining he helped seal the match when he kicked a loose pass fifteen metres from his own goal-line downfield and chased after it, regathering and running just over the half-way line before passing it James Roby in support who couldn't outrun Nathan Hindmarsh. From the play-the-ball twenty metres away from Australia's goal-line, the British moved the ball through the hands out to the other side of the field to winger Gareth Raynor who dived over in the corner. Long's conversion attempt struck the post and missed, but he later kicked a field goal in the final minutes to make it a 23 - 12 victory, Great Britain's first in Australia since their 1992 tour."]}, {"page": "Vince Mellars", "response": ["Just a few weeks before the start of the 2010 Super League season, Mellars signed for Crusaders RLFC.http://www.crusadersrfl.com/article.php?id=656 Crusaders sign former Crusader, 15 January 2010  Only fourteen days later, he made his d\u00e9but in 2010's Super League XV against Leeds where he put Gareth Raynor over the line for his first try for the Crusaders."]}, {"page": "2005 Challenge Cup", "response": ["Katherine Jenkins performed at the match which was on 27 August at Millennium Stadium, Cardiff and attended by 74,213 spectators.
