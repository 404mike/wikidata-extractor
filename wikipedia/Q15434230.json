The film stars Alan Bates, Janet McTeer, Jonathan Coy, Paul Rhys and Celia Imrie. It aired on BBC on 17 February 1991. Prasad won a Golden Gate Award in Best of Category: Television Feature from the San Francisco International Film Festival, and the drama was also nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama.", "Director Udayan Prasad said the relationship between Proust and C\u00e9leste is portrayed in the film \"like an old married couple\", and the idea is that C\u00e9leste created the reclusive environment which enabled Proust to work. Prasad also revealed that the \"script has its own reality\", and we didn't pretend for the drama to be a \"documentary about what Proust did in that short period of time\". Writer Alan Bennett made the point in the script about wanting to \"show people who are artistically engaged in the process of creativity as being barely human\". Prasad described Alan Bates as engaging in a \"sinister charm,\" that created a \"Proust who is both dislocated from the outside world and in control of his own\".", "John J. O'Connor, said that Alan Bennett created an \"extraordinarily complex universe, exploring with painstaking detail shifting relationships and subtle controls, esthetic theory and sexual obsessions, indeed life and art\". He also praised Alan Bates as capturing \"the underlying strength of the writer\", and \"lending enormous support is the music, performed by the Deline String Quartet\". Sheila Whitaker of the San Francisco Film Society wrote that Alan Bennett \"created a sympathetic and understated script\", that is \"dense with inflection and nuance rather than action, and the performances of Alan Bates as Proust and Janet McTeer as Celeste match Bennett's achievement\". Director Udayan Prasad won a Golden Gate Award from the Film Festival."]}]}}
