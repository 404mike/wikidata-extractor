His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers.\" Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clich\u00e9s and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale.Richards, Denby (1977). Notes to Chandos CD 8376 The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as \"the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible\".Glass, Herbert. \"Sinfonia da Requiem\" , Los Angeles Philharmonic, accessed 26 June 2013 Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: \"less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic\". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between \"Dawn\", \"Sunday Morning\", \"Moonlight\" and \"Storm\". The commentator Howard Posner observes that there is not a bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding.Posner, Howard. \"Four Sea Interludes\" , Los Angeles Philharmonic, accessed 26 June 2013 The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work \"exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [that] fits well into Britten's oeuvre.\" David Matthews calls it \"a brilliant educational exercise.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Pears", "response": ["Pears was born in Farnham, Surrey, the youngest of the seven children of Arthur Grant Pears and his wife, Jessie Elizabeth de Visme, n\u00e9e Luard. Arthur Pears was a civil engineer and successful businessman, who spent much of his time working overseas. The biographers Christopher Headington and Donald Mitchell both remark on two contrasting strands in Pears's heredity: the Luard family was notable for its naval and military connections, and on the Pears side there was a strong religious tradition, both Anglican and Quaker. Mitchell comments that Pears's lifelong pacifism stemmed from the Quaker side of the family, and adds, \"There was indeed something of the patrician Quaker in his looks, manners, and deeds. His habitual charm and courtesy rarely deserted him.\"Mitchell, Donald. \"Pears, Sir Peter Neville Luard (1910\u20131986)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2006, accessed 15 October 2013 "]}, {"page": "Julian Lloyd Webber", "response": ["| Christopher Headington || Serenade for Cello and Strings || Banqueting House, London, January 1995"]}, {"page": "List of compositions for piano and orchestra", "response": ["*Christopher Headington"]}, {"page": "Ed Welch", "response": ["His film work included the scores to British sex comedies such as the Confessions series (Confessions of a Pop Performer (1975), Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976), Confessions from a Holiday Camp (1977)), Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers (1977), and Rosie Dixon - Night Nurse (1978).
