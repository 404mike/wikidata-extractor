The dates of his birth and death are unknown; but he was a disciple of Thomas Chippendale, and subsequently of the Adams, and was possibly in partnership with Henry Copeland. \nDuring the greater part of his life he belonged to that flamboyant school which derived its inspiration from Louis XV models; but when he fell under the influence of Robert Adam he absorbed his manner so completely that it is often difficult to distinguish between them, just as it is sometimes easy to confound Locks work with the weaker efforts of Chippendale. Thus from being extravagantly rococo he progressed to a simple ordered classicism. His published designs are not equal to his original drawings, many of which are preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington, while the pieces themselves are often bolder and more solid than is suggested by the authors representations of them. He was a clever craftsman and holds a distinct place among the minor furniture designers of the second half of the 18th century.\nAmong his works, some of which were issued in conjunction with Copeland, are: A New Drawing Book of Ornaments; A New Book of Ornaments (1768); A New Book of Pier Frames, Ovals, Girandoles, Tables, etc. (1769); and A New Book of Foliage (1769).\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

A New Book of Ornaments appeared in 1746, but it is not clear whether the engravings with this title formed part of a book, or were issued only in separate plates; a few of the latter are all that are known to exist. Between 1752 and 1769 several collections of designs were produced by Copeland in conjunction with Matthias Lock; in one of them Copeland is described as of Cheapside. Some of the original drawings are in the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Copeland was probably the originator of a peculiar type of chair back, popular for a few years in the middle of the 18th century, consisting of a series of interlaced circles. Much of his work has been attributed to Thomas Chippendale, and it is certain that one derived many ideas from the other, but which was the originator and which the copyist is by no means clear. He died in 1754, when, on 8 October, his apprentice was handed over to his widow Elizabeth, who continued his business in his name."]}, {"page": "Lock (surname)", "response": ["* Matthias Lock, English 18th century furniture designer and cabinet-maker"]}, {"page": "Art collections of Holkham Hall", "response": ["* The Saloon: Is 28 by .
