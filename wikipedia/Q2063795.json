In Glasgow, where the party had traditionally enjoyed strong support, both elections produced a result in which every Labour held constituency was lost to the SNP, while in 2016 the Conservatives overtook Labour as the second largest party at Holyrood. Lamont lost her Glasgow Pollok seat to the SNP's Humza Yousaf, who secured it with a majority of 6,484, but she was one of four Labour candidates elected to the Glasgow regional list, where she was joined by Sarwar, James Kelly and Pauline McNeill. In response to the results, Lamont suggested Labour needed to understand the reasons behind it, and suggested that the 2014 referendum could be partially responsible. \"A bit of it, I think, is still the referendum, the Yes/No is the divide in people\u2019s minds rather than the politics of taxation, investing in public services against a low tax economy and so on.\""]}, {"page": "Govanhill", "response": ["*Members of Scottish Parliament (Glasgow region list): Patrick Harvie, Pam Duncan-Glancy, Pauline McNeill, Anas Sarwar, Sandesh Gulhane, Annie Wells, Paul Sweeney"]}, {"page": "Scottish Labour", "response": ["*Pauline McNeill - Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Justice", "|Pauline McNeill || Glasgow|| 1999|| Member for Glasgow Kelvin 1999\u20132011, Glasgow 2016\u2013"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Kelvin (Scottish Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Pauline McNeill"]}, {"page": "Pride Scotia", "response": ["* 2005: Pauline McNeill MSP"]}, {"page": "Strathclyde Law School", "response": ["* Pauline McNeill, MSP for Glasgow Kelvin"]}, {"page": "2011 Scottish Parliament election", "response": ["| Pauline McNeill"]}, {"page": "McNeill (surname)", "response": ["*Pauline McNeill (born 1962), Scottish Labour politician"]}]}}
