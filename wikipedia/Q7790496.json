His track record made him the focus of their efforts. Thomas Haweis who had inspired the creation of missionaries was particularly supportive. The objective was to send missionaries to the South Seas. Wilson had volunteered to lead such a journey and this offer was accepted in September 1795. It was Wilson who suggested that they should buy a boat and he found the \"Duff\" which was 264 tons and enabled the London Missionary Society to plan for a large number of missionaries. The proposed missionary group could include artisans so that the group could model their civilisation and be resistant to a small number of deaths.

One of Nowell's claims was that Middleton's acquaintance with Thomas Haweis was supposed to be enough to get him holy orders, refused by the Bishop of Hereford (Lord James Beauclerk) on the grounds of insufficient learning, through unspecified influence.
