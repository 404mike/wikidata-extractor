Initial output was poor, but after reassessing its responsibilities in 1986, the company produced films of note, including Boy Soldier (1986) and Rhosyn a Rhith (1986), the latter being the first film in the Welsh language to gain a London West End cinema release. Although the production of Welsh features from S4C was low, it aided the emergence of talented Welsh film-makers, such as Endaf Emlyn, Marc Evans and Stephen Bayly. S4C's 1995 policy, to produce up to two feature films a year, to be released to cinemas before television transmission allowed Welsh film-makers new opportunities. Yet the reluctance of London-based distributors to handle Welsh language films make it difficult for Welsh films to reach a wider audience.", "The early 1990s began with the release of Welsh language film Hedd Wyn. It won the Royal Television Society Best Drama award and became the first Welsh film to gain a nomination in the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

The 1990s also saw two important films from Endaf Emlyn, Un Nos Ola Leuad (1991) is seen as one of the finest Welsh films made, while his Gadael Lenin (1993) was voted by viewers at the 1993 London Film Festival as the most popular British film."]}, {"page": "Geraint Griffiths", "response": ["* Y Cloc (1986) Endaf Emlyn", "* Dirgelwch Yr Ogof (2002) Endaf Emlyn"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh films", "response": ["1991: Un Nos Ola Leuad, directed by Endaf Emlyn.", "1993: Gadael Lenin (Leaving Lenin), about a group of Welsh students and teachers who take a trip to Russia, was directed by Endaf Emlyn.", "1995: Y Mapiwr, directed by Endaf Emlyn."]}, {"page": "Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau", "response": ["In the past, the line-up has included Super Furry Animals, Steve Earle, The Dubliners Iwcs a Doyle, Burning Spear, Bob Geldof, Saw Doctors, Bryn F\u00f4n, Meic Stevens, Geraint Jarman a'r Cynghaneddwyr, Derwyddon Dr Gonzo, Grupo Fantasma, Paul Dooley, N'Faly Kouyate, Endaf Emlyn, Cerys Matthews and Goldie Lookin Chain."]}, {"page": "Ar Lan y M\u00f4r", "response": ["\"Ar Lan y M\u00f4r\" has been frequently recorded.
