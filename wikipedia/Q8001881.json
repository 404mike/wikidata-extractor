He was educated at St. Francis Xavier's College and the Catholic University College, Kensington.Following an apprenticeship with the Great Western Railway, he eventually became an assistant to William Shelford working on the designs for bridges for the Hull and Barnsley Railway.A civil engineer by trade, Stokes was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of Ransomes & Rapier, an engineering company based in Ipswich, which manufactured cranes. Between 1915 and 1918 Stokes worked for the Inventions Branch of the Ministry of Munitions where he invented the Stokes Mortar. The trench mortar was first used in 1915 during the Battle of Loos to fire a smoke shell. At first it was not liked but as the construction was improved it was widely used and eventually produced in two sizes.  This mortar continued in use, its effectiveness being improved again and again by other British engineers.Stokes received a knighthood in 1917 for inventing the mortar which was named for him. He was also given several forms of monetary reward by the Ministry of Munitions for his invention including royalties of \u00a31 per Stokes mortar bomb.\nStokes married Iren Ionides in 1899.His brother Leonard Stokes was an architect. His nephew Richard Stokes was a Labour MP and minister.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mortar (weapon)", "response": ["thumb|upright|left|Wilfred Stokes with example of his WWI mortar and bombs.", "It was not until the Stokes mortar was devised by Sir Wilfred Stokes in 1915 during the First World War that the modern mortar transportable by one person was born. In the conditions of trench warfare, there was a great need for a versatile and easily portable weapon that could be manned by troops under cover in the trenches. Stokes' design was initially rejected in June 1915 because it was unable to use existing stocks of British mortar ammunition, and it took the intervention of David Lloyd George (at that time Minister of Munitions) and Lieutenant Colonel J. C. Matheson of the Trench Warfare Supply Department (who reported to Lloyd George) to expedite manufacture of the Stokes mortar. The weapon proved to be extremely useful in the muddy trenches of the Western Front, as a mortar round could be aimed to fall directly into trenches, where artillery shells, because of their low angle of flight, could not possibly go.naval-military-press.com "]}, {"page": "List of inventions named after people", "response": ["* Stokes mortar \u2013 Wilfred Stokes"]}, {"page": "Frederick W.
