By this point, over 100 cities throughout the Southern United States had already desegregated their eateries, and the New Georgia Encyclopedia highlights later sit-in actions in Savannah and Rome, Georgia to argue that \"Atlanta actually lagged behind many of its neighbors in desegregating local institutions\". According to historian Stephen Tuck, desegregation in the city would remain \"piecemeal and sporadic\" until the Civil Rights Act of 1964."]}]}}
