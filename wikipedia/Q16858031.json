His first employment on his own account was engraving illustrations for books, and among the most noteworthy of these early plates were Smirke's illustrations to Don Quixote. His neat style and smooth finish made his pictures very attractive and popular, and although he executed several large plates, his chief work throughout his life was book illustration."]}, {"page": "Samuel Mitan", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Mitan"]}, {"page": "Mitan, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Mitan"]}]}}
