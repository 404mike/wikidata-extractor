During May 1999, injury put both Davison and Love on the sidelines and Croudson was handed his professional debut by Alan Buckley. The match was against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 May 1999 in the First Division. In an impressive performance, Croudson managed to pull off some fine saves and the game was drawn 0\u20130 with Croudson being awarded man of the match. 5 days later he played again in the club's 1\u20130 defeat away against Watford.", "During the 1999\u20132000 campaign Grimsby manager Alan Buckley made Croudson his second choice keeper and this would eventually see him firmly cement his place behind Town's new number one Danny Coyne. Incidentally Croudson's step up in ranks would eventually go on to see Andy Love depart for Blundell Park for Ilkeston Town midway through the season. Croudson went on to make 5 appearances in League and Cup that season. The 2000\u20132001 season came round and new manager Lennie Lawrence although initially favouring Croudson as his backup keeper briefly replaced him with loanee Danish keeper Morten Hyldgaard. Croudson would play no part in that particular season."]}, {"page": "Andrew Love", "response": ["Andrew or Andy Love may refer to:", "* Andy Love (jazz vocalist) (n\u00e9 Andrew Jackson Love; 1911\u20131982), jazz vocalist with the Tune Twisters", "* Andy Love (singer) (active 1998\u20132000), British singer (Northern Line)", "* Andy Love, British politician", "* Andy Love (English footballer) (born 1979), English footballer", "* Andy Love (Scottish footballer) (1905\u20131962), Scottish football winger"]}]}}
