The 19 he made in the first innings on his debut against Lancashire remained his top score.\nCox was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire; he died in Alcester, Warwickshire aged 65.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alcester", "response": ["* Gilbert Cox, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Cox (surname)", "response": ["*Gilbert Cox (1908\u20131974), English cricketer"]}]}}
