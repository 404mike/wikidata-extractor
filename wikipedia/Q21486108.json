Clerical opponents of Owenism were threatening to use the law to prevent money being taken at meetings on Sundays.  Only religious bodies were permitted to do so. Owenite lecturers were either to stop collecting money on Sundays, or make a public profession of adherence to Christianity. In Campfield, Manchester, the Rev. J. W. Kidd took legal action against the Hall of Science near his church. The Owenite missionary Robert Buchanan consequently took the dissenter's oath.Royle 1976, p.41. The Central Board of Owen's Universal Community Society was in favour of taking the oath, and of moderating anti-religious activity, and other lecturers followed Buchanan.  But others, including Charles Southwell, refused, and resigned their positions.Herrick (2007. p.725) says that Southwell didn't share Owen's \"Utopian ideals\" either."]}]}}
