Born to English parents in Paris, he lived in France until he was nine, before attending Eton College and then the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and served with them during the First World War. After the war he spent seven years in the Sahara desert, and then travelled through Asia. Bodley wrote several books about his travels. He was considered among the most distinguished British writers on the Sahara, as well as one of the main western sources of information on the South Seas Mandate.\nBodley moved to the United States in 1935, where he worked as a screenwriter. He rejoined the British Army at the outbreak of the Second World War and was sent to Paris to work for the Ministry of Information. He later immigrated to the United States, where he continued to work as a writer and also as an advisor to the United States Office of War Information.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1970", "response": ["* May 26 \u2013 R.

According to R. V. C. Bodley, Uthman was not assigned to any authority, and earned no distinction in any of Muhammad's campaigns.R.V.C. Bodley, The Messenger \u2013 the Life of Mohammed, pgs. 348\u20139.Uthman-ibn-Affan , Britannica Uthman had a reputation of favouring family members. One way he displayed this was his habit of splitting war booty among his relatives to the exclusion of the combatants. During the Invasion of Hamra al-Asad a Meccan spy, Muawiyah bin Al Mugheerah, the cousin of Uthman ibn Affan, had been captured. According to the Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri, Uthman gave him shelter after getting permission from Muhammad, and Muhammad told him that if he was caught again after 3 days he would be executed. As such, Muawiyah was given a grace period of three days and arranged a camel and provisions for his return journey to Mecca. Uthman departed with Muhammad for Hamra-al-Asad, and Muawiyah overstayed his grace. Though he fled by the time the army returned, Muhammad ordered his pursuit and execution. The orders were carried out.Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar , p. 183Ibn Hisham 2/60\u2013129; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/91\u2013108; Fath Al-Bari 7/345\u2013377; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.242\u2013275 ", "thumb|Rashidun Caliphate at its peak under Uthman (654)When Ali was asked, he didn't reply. When Uthman was asked, he voted for Ali, Zubayr said for Ali or Uthman and Sa'd said for Uthman. Uthman was a rich merchant who used his wealth to support Islam yet at no time before his caliphate had he displayed any qualities of leadership or actually led an army. However, according to Wilferd Madelung, he was chosen as the only strong counter candidate to Ali as he alone could to some extent Ali's close kinship ties with Muhammad. R. V. C. Bodley believed that after Umar's assassination, Ali rejected the caliphate as he disagreed with governing according to regulations established by Abu Bakr and Umar, and that Uthman accepted those terms which he failed to honour during his ten-year caliphate.R. V. C. Bodley, The Messenger \u2013 the Life of Mohammed. The six counselors appointed by Umar met as soon as the funeral was over. The caliphate was first offered to Ali with the condition that he governs according to the Qur'an (Islamic Book), the traditions of Mohammed, and the regulations established by Abu Bakr and Umar. Ali accepted the first two conditions and refused the third. The offer was, accordingly, withdrawn and Uthman was approached with the same terms. Being less honest than Ali, he accepted them without demur.", "According to R. V. C. Bodley, Uthman subjected most of the Islamic nation to his relatives, Bani Umayya, who were partially accursed during Muhammad's lifetime.Madelung, Wilferd (1997).

While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Mor\u00e8s. Although deMor\u00e8s had been reportedly murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara, no one had been arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar with the area where deMor\u00e8s died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMor\u00e8s' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMor\u00e8s widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding."]}, {"page": "Military career of Ali", "response": ["'Allahu Akbar!'(Allah is the greatest) echoed from the eagerly watching Muslims.
