As a schoolboy he was associated with Cardiff City, but when he left school in 1973, he joined Birmingham City as an apprentice. He was capped by England at youth level in 1975, and turned professional with Birmingham in the same year. In November 1975 Smith saved a penalty kick from Kenny Dalglish in a friendly match against Celtic celebrating the centenary of the Birmingham club. He made his debut in the First Division on 13 March 1976 as an 18-year-old, standing in for Dave Latchford in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Liverpool. He kept his place for the next game, but inconsistency meant he was never more than a reserve goalkeeper.In March 1978 Smith joined Bradford City of the Third Division for a fee of \u00a35,000. Relegated at the end of the 1977\u201378 season, Smith ended his Bradford City career four years and 105 league games later with the club newly promoted back to the Third Division. He went on to 15 months and 54 league games back in the Fourth Division with Crewe Alexandra, before returning nearer home to non-league football with Trowbridge Town. Three months after joining as a player, Smith took over as Trowbridge manager as well.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steven Smith", "response": ["*Steve Smith (political scientist) (born 1952), British international relations theorist and senior university manager", "*Steve Smith (comedian) (born 1945), Canadian comedian, best known for his alter ego, Red Green", "*Steve Smith (clown) (born 1951), American clown", "*Steve Smith (American musician) (born 1954), jazz and rock drummer", "*Steve Smith (American singer) (born 1945), American singer", "*Steve Smith (British musician), provided vocals for Dirty Vegas and Steve Mac", "*Steve Smith (Minnesota politician) (1949\u20132014), American politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives", "*Steve Smith (Arizona politician), member of the Arizona House of Representatives", "*Steve Smith Sr. (born 1979), retired wide receiver who played with the Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens", "*Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1974), arena football offensive specialist", "*Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1985), former Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants", "*Steve Smith (quarterback) (born 1962), player for the University of Michigan Wolverines, 1980\u20131983", "*Steve Smith (running back) (1964\u20132021), player for the Los Angeles Raiders and Seattle Seahawks", "*Steve Smith (offensive lineman) (born 1944), offensive tackle & defensive end for Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings & Philadelphia Eagles", "*Steve Smith (footballer, born 1874), English international footballer", "*Steve Smith (footballer, born 1899), Scottish football goalkeeper", "*Steve Smith (footballer, born 1946), English footballer and manager (Huddersfield Town)", "*Steve Smith (footballer, born 1957), English footballer (Birmingham City, Bradford City and Crewe Alexandra)", "*Steve Smith (pole vaulter) (1951\u20132020), American pole vaulter", "*Steve Smith (American high jumper) (born 1971), American high jumper", "*Steve Smith (British high jumper) (born 1973), British high jumper", "*Steve Smith (infielder) (born 1952), Cleveland Indians third base coach and former infielder", "*Steve Smith (pitcher) (born 1961), American baseball coach and former pitcher", "*Steve Smith (basketball) (born 1969), retired NBA player, basketball analyst", "*Steve Smith (basketball coach), American head coach for Oak Hill Academy basketball team", "*Steve Smith (cricketer) (born 1989), Australian international cricketer", "*Steve Smith (cricketer, born 1961), Australian, Australian Rebel, and Transvaal cricketer", "*Steve Smith (ice hockey, born in Canada) (born 1963), ice hockey player for the Philadelphia Flyers and the Buffalo Sabres", "*Steve Smith (ice hockey, born in Scotland) (born 1963), ice hockey player for the Edmonton Oilers, Chicago Blackhawks, and the Calgary Flames", "*Steve Smith (rugby union, born 1959), Irish rugby union player and British Lion", "*Steve Smith (rugby union, born 1973) (born 1973), Manu Samoa & North Harbour Rugby Union player from New Zealand", "*Steve Smith (rugby union, born 1951) (born 1951), English rugby union player and British Lion", "*Steve Smith (cyclist) (1989\u20132016), Canadian mountain biker", "*Steve Smith (pool player) (born 1954), American pool player", "*Steve Smith (darts player) (born 1979), English darts player", "*Steve Smith (general) (born 1959), senior officer in the Australian Army Reserve", "*Steve Smith (American Dad!), in American Dad!"]}, {"page": "Steve Smith (footballer born 1957)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steve Smith (footballer, born 1957)"]}]}}
