J. Sharp, Sword Dances of Northern England Together with the Horn Dance of Abbots Bromley, (Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing, 2003). Folk songs were collected there from the 19th century but, though it probably had more attention than other northern counties, its rich heritage of industrial folk song was relatively neglected.C. J. D. Ingledew, Ballads and Songs of Yorkshire (London, 1860); C. Forshaw, Holyrod\u2019s Collection of Yorkshire Ballads (London, 1892).

Davenport, ed., The South Riding Songbook: Songs from South Yorkshire and the North Midlands (South Riding Folk Network, 1998). Yorkshire folk song lacked the unique instrumental features of folk in areas like Northumbria and was chiefly distinguished by the use of dialect, particularly in the West Riding and exemplified by the song \u2018On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\u2019, probably written in the later 19th century and using a Kent folk tune (almost certainly borrowed via a Methodist hymnal), but often seen as an unofficial Yorkshire anthem.A. Kellett, On Ilkla Mooar baht 'at: the Story of the Song(Smith Settle, 1988). Most Yorkshire folk songs were not unique and tended to be adapted to fit local geography and dialect, as was the case with probably the most commercially successful Yorkshire song, \u2018Scarborough Fair\u2019, recorded by Simon & Garfunkel, which was a version of the Scottish ballad \u2018The Elfin Knight\u2019.F.
