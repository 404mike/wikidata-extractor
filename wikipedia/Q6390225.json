The CBA soon developed a standardized record card for industrial monuments, which it distributed to volunteer groups around the UK. In 1965, the National Record of Industrial Monuments (NRIM) was created as a central archive for the record cards that had been collected by Angus Buchanan at the University of Bath.Industrial Archaeology:A Handbook, Palmer, Nevell & Sissons, 2012 By the late 1960s, a number of local industrial archaeology groups had been formed in the UK, including the Gloucestershire Society for Industrial Archaeology in 1963, the Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society in 1967, and the Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society in 1968, among others. The primary mission of these local IA groups during this period was recording the remaining relics of industrial history, especially those deemed to be most at risk from urban redevelopment schemes. Depending on the condition of the site or artifact, recording typically consists of compiling a brief summary of the site's history through available records, including old maps or photographs, followed by detailed onsite measurements, drawings and photographs of the existing conditions of the site. Generally, a report is prepared and copies are filed in a public archive for the benefit of future generations. Most recording trips are intended to obtain a general overview of existing conditions, and are not meant to be an exhaustive study.", "In 1963, British journalist Kenneth Hudson published the first IA text, titled Industrial archaeology: an introduction. Four years later in April 1967, Hudson spoke at a seminar at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., at what is considered the birth of the IA-movement in the United States. The seminar, which was attended by an audience of historic preservationists, museum professionals and others, focused on what was being done to promote the study of industrial archaeology in Great Britain and in Europe, and what needed to be done in the United States. By this time, a number of select historic industrial sites had been recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), which until then had mainly concentrated its efforts on architecturally significant sites. In 1967, the notable New England Textile Mills Survey (NETMS) was performed under the HABS umbrella, led by Robert M. Vogel, curator of the Division of Mechanical and Civil at the Smithsonian Museum of History and Technology. The NETMS was the first large-scale, industrial recording project by HABS.Vogel, Robert M., Historical Archaeology, The New England Textile Mill Survey, Vol. 1, 1967, page 34. It was followed by the New England Textile Mill Survey II in 1968.Sande, Ted, Technology and Culture, The National Park Service and the History of Technology: The New England Textile Mill Survey, Vol. 14, No. 3, July 1973 The full reports from the 1967 and 1968 textile mill surveys are now available for public viewing on the Library of Congress website, including the Amoskeag Millyard in Manchester, New Hampshire, which was drastically altered soon after the survey was completed."]}, {"page": "Beamish Museum", "response": ["Beamish was influential on the Black Country Living Museum, Blists Hill Victorian Town and, in the view of museologist Kenneth Hudson, more widely in the museum community and is a significant educational resource locally.

Burcaw (United States), so that the more theoretical approach to museology, from Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd, was followed by authors in countries with a bigger tendency to theorization: the German and Latin schools, as well as Latin America."]}, {"page": "Dig Where You Stand movement", "response": ["The movement took its name and its founding spirit from Lindqvist's book Gr\u00e4v d\u00e4r du st\u00e5r (Dig where you stand), published in 1978. In his emphasis on workers' researching their own history Lindqvist drew inspiration from Maxim Gorky, from public history campaigns in post-revolutionary China (where he studied for a year during the Great Leap Forward), from Kenneth Hudson's books and television shows on industrial archaeology in the 1960s, and from the British oral history movement. The motto was drawn from Friedrich Nietzsche: Wo du stehst, grab tiefhinein! (Where you stand, dig deep!) The movement was the culmination of a variety of developments in Swedish cultural life in the 1970s such as the revival of documentarist fiction and the Bygd i f\u00f6rvandling (\"Community in Change\") local history campaign. The latter worked through books and a television series and built on the strong Swedish tradition of study circles by emphasising the training of study circle leaders. A successful trial in two regions in 1973 resulted in the creation of 700 study circles with 90,000 participants, and the program was extended across the country. It brought a large amount of oral and written reminiscences, photographs and documents to local museums and archives."]}]}}
