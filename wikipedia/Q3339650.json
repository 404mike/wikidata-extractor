This was commonplace in the Baroque era, when the da capo aria, particularly when in slow tempo, required the singer to be able to improvise a variation during the return of the main material. During this period, according to Nicholas Cook, it was often the case that \"responsibility for the most highly elaborated stage in the compositional process fell not upon the composer but upon the executant. In their instrumental sonatas composers like Corelli, Geminiani, and Handel sometimes supplied the performer with only the skeleton of the music that was to be played; the ornamentation, which contributes crucially to the music's effect, had to be provided by the performer.\" Cook cites Geminiani's elaboration of Corelli (see above) as an example of an instance \"in which the composer, or a performer, wrote down a version of one of these movements as it was meant to be played.\""]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 002 || Music || Nicholas Cook ||    (2nd ed.) || 1998 || music"]}, {"page": "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika", "response": ["British musicologist Nicholas Cook states:"]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)", "response": ["Earlier, in 1814\u201315, Beethoven also began sketches for a 6th piano concerto in D major, Hess 15.
