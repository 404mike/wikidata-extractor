He played for Manchester City in the Football League First Division as a wing half. As his playing career came to an end, he decided to become a coach and worked at clubs in lower leagues before getting the chance to join Liverpool in 1958.\nFrom December 1959, he worked with Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley and was highly successful in his coaching of the club's reserve team, being mainly responsible for the development of future star players like Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith. After Shankly retired in 1974, Fagan became assistant manager to Paisley and finally manager himself when Paisley retired in 1983. In his first season, Fagan achieved an unprecedented \"treble\" as Liverpool won the European Cup, the League Championship and the League Cup. He had decided to retire at the end of his second season but his final match in charge was the 1985 European Cup Final which was the scene of the Heysel Stadium disaster, an event that caused him great distress.\nFagan was an uncomplicated man who believed in the simplicity of football, a devoted family man who preferred to just get on with his job and shun the limelight. He was one of the most respected figures in the game. He and his family lived in the same house not far from Anfield throughout his Liverpool career and afterwards. He died of cancer in 2001, aged eighty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kenny Dalglish", "response": ["Dalglish became player-manager of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of Joe Fagan, winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991. Eight months later, Dalglish made a return to football management with Blackburn Rovers, whom he led from the Second Division to win the Premier League in 1995. Soon afterwards, he stepped down as manager to become Director of Football at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996. In January 1997, Dalglish took over as manager at Newcastle United. Newcastle finished as runners-up in the Premier League during his first season, but they only finished 13th in 1997\u201398, which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed Director of Football at Celtic in 1999, and later manager, where he won the Scottish League Cup before an acrimonious departure the following year.", "After becoming player-manager on the retirement of Joe Fagan in the 1985 close season, Dalglish selected himself for just 21 First Division games in 1985\u201386 as Liverpool won the double, but he started the FA Cup final win over Everton. On the last day of the league season, his goal in a 1\u20130 away win over Chelsea gave Liverpool their 16th league title. Dalglish had a personally better campaign in the 1986\u201387 season, scoring six goals in 18 league appearances, but by then he was committed to giving younger players priority for a first-team place.", "After the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 and Joe Fagan's subsequent resignation as manager, Dalglish became player-manager of Liverpool. In his first season in charge in 1985\u201386, he guided the club to its first \"double\". Liverpool achieved this by winning the League Championship by two points over Everton (Dalglish himself scored the winner in a 1\u20130 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to secure the title on the final day of the season), and the FA Cup by beating Everton in the final."]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.", "response": ["Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its formation.

Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Ben\u00edtez and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a nineteenth League title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.", "Liverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1\u20130 to Burnley.

Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal. The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953\u201354 season. Soon after Liverpool lost 2\u20131 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958\u201359 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager.

Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season. Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence that separated the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1\u20130 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years.

In February 1982, Wolverhampton Wanderers had approached him about succeeding John Barnwell as manager as they were heading for relegation from the First Division.

Shankly brought success to Liverpool, gaining promotion to the First Division and winning three League Championships and the UEFA Cup. He laid foundations on which his successors Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan were able to build by winning seven league titles and four European Cups in the ten seasons after Shankly retired in 1974. A charismatic, iconic figure at the club, his oratory stirred the emotions of the fanbase. In 2019, 60 years after Shankly arrived at Liverpool, Tony Evans of The Independent wrote, \u201cShankly created the idea of Liverpool, transforming the football club by emphasising the importance of the Kop and making supporters feel like participants.\u201d", "In spite of the difficulties, Shankly felt immediately at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, whom he saw as his kind of people. He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty to each other and to the club.Kelly, p. 141. Paisley's influence at Liverpool was crucial for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was \"the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician\".Kelly, p. 138. One aspect of the quartet's legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the \"Boot Room\", which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive \u2013 indeed, Shankly said of the latter:Shankly, pp. 87\u201388.", "Many of the new players came to Liverpool because of a new scouting system created by Shankly in 1967 and placed under the control of new chief scout Geoff Twentyman, who had played for Shankly at Carlisle and had then spent several seasons at Liverpool, retiring shortly before Shankly's appointment. According to Stephen Kelly, hiring Twentyman as chief scout was \"perhaps Shankly's finest signing ever\".Kelly, p. 244. It was through Twentyman that Liverpool found the new players and, after Shankly retired, Twentyman gave sterling service to Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan by finding players including Phil Neal, Alan Hansen and Ian Rush.Kelly, pp. 245\u2013246. As always, Shankly kept things simple and Twentyman was told to look for a prospect's basic qualities which were the abilities to pass the ball and move into position to receive a pass.Hughes, p. 17. Shankly also wanted Twentyman to check the player's personality and ensure he had the right attitude for a professional footballer. Above all, said Twentyman, \"he wanted to know if the lad had the heart to play for Liverpool\". Although Shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and Twentyman's brief was to find young players so he (Shankly) could mould them into what he wanted.Hughes, p. 44.", "Although some club officials like secretary Peter Robinson wanted bygones to be bygones, Tommy Smith summarised the board's view as one of satisfaction that Shankly had gone at last. There was a perception that Shankly was an overbearing figure, who could use a position on the board to be a \"back-seat driver\", and the board were well aware that Matt Busby's time as a Manchester United director had been disastrous. Busby's successors had complained about being undermined by his continued presence at United, who had been relegated in 1974. While Liverpool's treatment of Shankly may have seemed disrespectful, they were acting in the best interests of the club and its new manager by pursuing the same relentless winning ethic that Shankly himself had instilled. In any event, their perceived ruthlessness was vindicated by the unprecedented haul of League Championship titles and European Cups won over the next decade under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan."]}, {"page": "Jan M\u00f8lby", "response": ["Liverpool manager Joe Fagan invited M\u00f8lby to have a ten-day trial and finally signed him on 22 August 1984.

Ben\u00edtez's calm, methodical approach at half time was said to give the players the belief they could pull off an improbable comeback and win Liverpool an historic fifth European Cup. In doing so, Ben\u00edtez became only the third manager in history (after Bob Paisley and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho) to win the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League in successive seasons, and the second Liverpool manager (after Joe Fagan) ever to win the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in his first season in charge.

He made his debut as a substitute on 18 August 1984 in the 1\u20130 Charity Shield defeat to derby rivals Everton. With Ian Rush injured at the start of the 1984\u201385 season, Walsh partnered Kenny Dalglish up front, and he scored just 14 seconds into his Anfield debut on 27 August in a 3\u20130 win over West Ham United. However, he picked up a knee injury in October which caused him to miss six weeks and allowed Rush to re-establish himself as Dalglish's preferred strike partner. He scored 13 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions throughout the 1984\u201385 campaign, the most significant goal being the equaliser in the last minute of extra-time against rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals at Goodison Park. However Liverpool would lose the replay, and also finished as runners-up in the league and European Cup. Walsh started the 1985 European Cup Final against Juventus at Heysel Stadium, but had to come off early in the second half after aggravating a stomach injury; Liverpool lost the game 1\u20130, though the day would be remembered for the disaster which cost 39 lives."]}, {"page": "Bob Paisley", "response": ["He stayed with the club, and took on the two roles of reserve team coach and club physiotherapist.

Under their leadership, the fortunes of Liverpool turned around dramatically and, in the 1961\u201362 season, the team gained promotion back to the First Division. Paisley filled an important role as tactician under Shankly's leadership, and the team won numerous honours during the next twelve seasons.", "In 1974, Shankly retired as manager and, despite Paisley's own initial reluctance, he was appointed as Shankly's successor. He went on to lead Liverpool through a period of domestic and European dominance, winning twenty honours in nine seasons: six League Championships, three League Cups, six Charity Shields, three European Cups, one UEFA Cup and one UEFA Super Cup. He won honours at a rate of 2.2 per season, a rate surpassed only by Pep Guardiola. At the time of his retirement he had won the Manager of the Year Award a record six times.

He later became the reserve team coach and then, in August 1959 when Albert Shelley retired, first team trainer.Kelly, p. 138. The arrival of Bill Shankly as manager in December 1959 transformed the fortunes of the club and Paisley recalled that \"from the moment he arrived, we got on like a house on fire\". On his first day in charge, Shankly held a meeting with the coaching staff which consisted of Paisley, Reuben Bennett and Joe Fagan to tell them that he was not bringing in his own coaches. He wanted to work with them and so guaranteed them their jobs. Shankly pointed out that he would decide the training strategy and they must all work together with absolutely loyalty to each other and to the club.Kelly, p. 141. Under Phil Taylor, training had been the traditional slog of physical exercise and road running. Shankly insisted on training which was \"based on speed and using the ball\". Five-a-side games were introduced as a key part of the strategy. Paisley had always been keen on training with the ball and was, like Fagan and Bennett, delighted to implement Shankly's methods.Kelly, p. 145. Fagan is credited with converting a storage area at Anfield into a \"common room\" for the coaches and it became the now-legendary Boot Room.

After achieving promotion, Toshack's former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly heaped praise on his achievements, stating \"he's done a remarkable job, I would say he's possibly manager of the century.\" Once they reached the top flight, Swansea were predicted by many to be relegated, but in their first match in the First Division they claimed a 5\u20131 victory over Leeds United after a hat-trick from newly arrived club-record signing Bob Latchford.

Swansea topped the league at several stages of the season, leading the division with only three months remaining, but injuries to key-players Latchford and another former Liverpool teammate of Toshack's Ray Kennedy, saw a downturn in results and they won just one of their final six matches before finishing their first campaign in the top flight in sixth position. During this period, he was told by the Liverpool board that he was their choice to replace current manager Bob Paisley when he chose to retire. Toshack had openly coveted the position stating \"When I went to Swansea the thing I wanted in the long term was to end up at Liverpool\". However, Paisley remained longer than expected and the position eventually went to Joe Fagan. Swansea were relegated the following year as the club suffered financial difficulties after relatively big spending under Toshack's tenure and then suffered a second successive relegation. He resigned in October 1983 but returned eight weeks later, remaining with the club for a further three months before departing again in March 1984.
