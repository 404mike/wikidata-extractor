Her father was Joseph Gouge Greenwood and her mother was Elizabeth (Eliza) Taylor. Her maternal grandfather was Unitarian minister John Taylor. Alice had a younger sister and her mother died in 1871. The sisters were brought up in Fallowfield after her father remarried. Her father's career in teaching went well and he rose to be a Professor of History and Classics. In 1857 he was made principal of Owen's College. In 1880 he became the vice-chancellor of Victoria University whilst Alice was at Cheltenham Ladies' College. In 1882 she left the college and she was able to side step the discrimination to women at Victoria University. Her father was generally supportive of her education and she was able to avoid the rule that prevented women from entering the university by attending lectures held by the university in Brunswick Street. She was mentored by the Latin professor Augustus Samuel Wilkins and by Herman Hager who taught German literature, but importantly, she was spotted by Adolphus William Ward who was professor of English language and history."]}, {"page": "Augustus Wilkins", "response": ["#redirect Augustus Samuel Wilkins"]}]}}
