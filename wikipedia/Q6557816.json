As a child, she studied recorder, flute at age 11 and piano. She was accepted into the Royal College of Music Junior College, where she took private lessons in each of these three instruments and played in a recorder consort. At age 15, Brown attended the Trevor Wye Summer School which motivated her to further her flute study and she later attended the Royal Northern College of Music to study with Wye. It was here that her interest in baroque flute grew. She also studied baroque flute with Lisa Beznosiuk during her years at RNCM. After graduation, she obtained positions with the Academy of Ancient Music and Kent Opera. In 1984, Brown traveled to the US to compete in the National Flute Association's Young Artist Competition, where she won first place. She credits this competition as helping her find international connections and becoming more connected to the flute community."]}, {"page": "List of women classical flautists", "response": ["*Lisa Beznosiuk (born 1956), flautist specializing in Baroque and historical works"]}]}}
