The installation is mounted in the building formerly used as a morgue by the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum and later the Parkside Lunatic Asylum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, now in the Adelaide Botanic Garden. Scottish physician William Ramsay Smith, who practised medicine at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in the early 1900s and used to sell body parts to international buyers, obtained some of his material from the morgue. Scarce also found that the practice of trading body parts continues today on the dark web, despite the advances in medical ethics, human rights and cultural heritage law and practices (including around the repatriation of human remains). The theme of the Biennial is monsters, and Smith is the monster represented in Scarce's exhibit."]}, {"page": "John Henry Chinner", "response": ["| 30px || William Ramsay Smith || William Ramsay Smith  ||  || "]}]}}
