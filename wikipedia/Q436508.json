They went on to finish first in the final against the German team, but were disqualified for an early relay, and were relegated to the silver medal instead.  Guo and Gong's coach Daniel Morelon maintains that the pair were \"robbed\" of the gold medal, and described it as an \"injustice\". He complained that the judges refused to provide a \"video footage of the race on slow motion\", and only provided a \"vague explanation\" for the infringement they had allegedly committed. However, the British cycling champions Victoria Pendleton and Jessica Varnish, who were also disqualified for a similar reason earlier on in the competition, accepted the judges decision and chose not to claim that they were unfairly robbed of a medal.
