Hardstaff's father, Joe senior played for Nottinghamshire and England and his son, also named Joe, played first-class cricket as well.Cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, remarked, \"Hardstaff was one of the most artistic batsmen ever to set foot on a cricket field but he paid the high price of falling out with Gubby Allen\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Zealand cricket team in England in 1937", "response": ["England's debutant openers, Len Hutton and Jim Parks senior, did not last long, but Joe Hardstaff junior and Wally Hammond then hit centuries and shared a third wicket partnership of 245. But only Eddie Paynter of the other batsmen made runs. New Zealand lost wickets regularly, with Kerr and Hadlee making 30s and Wallace reaching 52. But at 176 for seven wickets, the follow-on looked likely. Then an eighth wicket partnership of 104 between Moloney, who made 64 and Roberts, unbeaten on 66, came to the rescue. The new openers failed again in England's second innings, but Hardstaff made 64 and Charles Barnett an undefeated 83 to set up the declaration. Resolute batting by Wallace, with 56, and Kerr, who was injured and came in at No 7, saved the match for New Zealand."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in the West Indies in 1947\u201348", "response": ["* Batsmen \u2013 Len Hutton, Jack Robertson, Joe Hardstaff junior, Dennis Brookes, Winston Place, Gerald Smithson"]}]}}
