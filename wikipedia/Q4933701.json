He was the elder brother of Peter Pursell and uncle of the similarly named Robert Wilson Pursell. He played in the 1914 FA Cup Final, but was banned for life for his part in the 1915 British football betting scandal. However his ban was lifted for his actions in World War I, and he went on to play for Port Vale, before retiring with a broken leg in 1922.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe Schofield", "response": ["In preparation for the 1920\u201321 campaign, he signed full-back Bob Pursell from Liverpool, as well as inside-forward Tom Page from St Mirren, and right-half Freddy Price from Wolverhampton Wanderers. He sold William Aitken to Newcastle United for a fee of \u00a32,500. Vale beat Potteries derby rivals Stoke home and away, but their form suffered heavily with the sale of top-scorer Bobby Blood to West Bromwich Albion for a club record \u00a34,000 in February.

Despite this activity, the team were defeated five times in their first six games. They remained rock bottom until a remarkable turn around in form saw them go unbeaten in nine games from 4 February to 1 April. Vale eventually finished 18th, three points ahead of relegated Bradford Park Avenue. At the end of the season \u00a33,000 was trimmed from the wage bill by letting go of Bob Pursell, who had broken his leg; aged half-back Joe Brough who was said to have felt 'worn out'; 38-year-old stopper Walter Smith; forward Albert Pearson; 35-year-old Robert Firth; and 33-year-old Jack Peart."]}, {"page": "Bob Pursell (footballer, born 1919)", "response": ["Robert Wilson Pursell (28 September 1919 \u2013 August 2005) was a Scottish footballer who played as a full-back for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Port Vale, Winsford United, and Northwich Victoria.

He made his debut on 24 December, in a 3\u20132 defeat by Burnley at Turf Moor, filling in for Bob Pursell.

The capacity of The Old Recreation Ground was increased to 30,000; mainly due to the fund raising activities of the Supporters' Club.

The side made particularly hard work of finding the net, drawing a blank in five of these games. A 5\u20132 loss at Bury was reversed into a 5\u20132 win at home, and the team went on a useful run of eight points from six games. However, from the end of November up until February the club lost nine of their ten league games, as the club stood rooted to the bottom slot. The club turned things around in some style by going two months unbeaten, winning six of their nine games. During this run they went seven games without conceding a goal, with goalkeeper Peers so confident he often felt able to lean casually on his goalpost to watch the Pursell brothers clear up any danger in front of him. The run was broken after injuries set in \u2013 including a broken leg for Bob Pursell that necessitated his retirement from the game. Nevertheless, the club continued to pick up enough points to ensure their Second Division survival.", "Finances were as ever of great concern to the club, and by February the poor crowd figures meant that \u00a32,000 was needed to keep the club afloat. A 'Shilling Fund' was established to raise donations, which resulted in donations from First Division sides Preston North End and Huddersfield Town. A loss of \u00a34,641 was made on the season, with an economic downturn getting the blame for a shocking drop in gate receipt figures. The club even accused local paper The Sentinel of overestimating the crowd sizes. Finances were also hit by a raise in player's wages following the raising of the maximum payments limit. Aiming to make a \u00a3500 the following season, the director's announced a cut in the wage bill to the tune of \u00a33,000. This meant letting go of Bob Pursell, who had broken his leg; aged half-back Joe Brough who was said to have felt 'worn out'; 38-year-old stopper Walter Smith; forward Albert Pearson; 35-year-old Robert Firth; and 33-year-old Jack Peart.

They finished in second place behind Aston Villa in the 1909\u201310 season, the last for their captain, Raisbeck, who returned to his native Scotland to play for Partick Thistle. Liverpool's form declined after his departure, with their best performance in the League a 12th-place finish in the 1912\u201313 season. There was improvement in 1914 when the club reached their first FA Cup final, which they lost 1\u20130 to Burnley at Crystal Palace. The following season four Liverpool players were implicated in the 1915 British football betting scandal, which involved a match with Manchester United. A 2\u20130 victory for United was required to win the bet, in which players from both sides were involved. With the score at 2\u20130, Liverpool's Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar with a shot, at which several of his teammates gestured angrily towards him. Subsequently, Tom Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were found guilty by a Football Association (FA) enquiry of conspiring with three Manchester United players (Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West) to fix a United win. All the players involved were banned for life. Following the end of the First World War, in which Turnbull was killed at the Battle of Arras in 1917, the FA lifted the surviving players' bans in recognition of their service in the conflict."]}, {"page": "Bob Pursell (footballer born 1889)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Pursell (footballer, born 1889)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["*Bob Pursell, Sr., Peter Pursell (brother), Bob Pursell, Jr. (nephew, son of Peter)"]}]}}
