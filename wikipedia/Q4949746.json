Green grew frustrated by Yorkshire Television's failure to remove programme producer Jess Yates when he requested this to be done and so leaked to Botham the stories of Yates' affair with the young actress Anita Kay, whose story, published in the News of the World, destroyed Yates' career. In May 1997, shortly after Green's death, Botham wrote the expos\u00e9 story, also in the News of the World, of Green being the biological father of Jess Yates' daughter, TV presenter Paula Yates, something she read when the tabloids printed the story, and which was later confirmed with a DNA test result in December 1997. Through his daughter Linda, Green had four granddaughters, Delia, Christina, Stephanie and Marina. Through his daughter Paula, Green had four other granddaughters whom he never knew: Fifi, Peaches and Pixie Geldof, fathered by Bob Geldof, and Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence, fathered by Michael Hutchence. Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence was legally adopted by Bob Geldof in 2007.

The tabloids ran the bogus stories about the likes of Amy Winehouse, Pixie Geldof and Guy Ritchie. Secretly interviewed reporters claimed that \"the PCC is run by the newspaper Editors\", \"Getting a PCC isn't great, but, a lot of papers just brush it aside, all it is, is a little apology somewhere in the paper, you get a slap on the wrist, you get reported by the PCC, but there's no money\". The PCC took no action against the papers that ran these stories but did respond with a letter to the Editor of The Belfast Telegraph. The response of Chris Atkins, the documentary's director, was that the PCC had yet still not acted on the issue of several newspapers breaking their Code of conduct 8.2."]}, {"page": "Alleyn's School", "response": ["* Pixie Geldof"]}, {"page": "1990 in British music", "response": ["*17 September - Pixie Geldof, model and singer, daughter of Bob Geldof and Paula Yates"]}, {"page": "Pixie (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Pixie Geldof, English model and singer"]}, {"page": "Worthy FM", "response": ["Guests and interviewees this year included Fatboy Slim, Big Boi, Noah and the Whale, Will Young, Pixie Geldof and Guy Garvey.
