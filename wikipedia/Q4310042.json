Cox had been considering a return to painting in oils since 1836 and in 1839 had taken lessons in oil painting from William James M\u00fcller, to whom he had been introduced by mutual friend George Arthur Fripp. Hostility between the Society of Painters in Water Colours and the Royal Academy made it difficult for an artist to be recognised for work in both watercolour and oil in London, however, and it is likely that Cox would have preferred to explore this new medium in the more supportive environment of his home town. By the early 1840s his income from sales of his watercolours was sufficient to allow him to abandon his work as a drawing master, and in June 1841 he moved with his wife to Greenfield House in Harborne, then a village on Birmingham's south western outskirts. It was this move that would enable the higher levels of freedom and experimentation that were to characterise his later work."]}, {"page": "M\u00fcller (surname)", "response": ["*William James M\u00fcller (1812\u20131845), English artist"]}, {"page": "John Frederick Lewis", "response": ["Lewis was an early traveller on what was to become a well-trodden route for English artists, though some ten years behind David Wilkie in Spain.

In 1844, when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded, the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it. At this time the president and committee was predominantly its patrons, rather than its artists.

Binyon described them as showing him \"at the height of his subject\", and according to Andrew Hemingway, some of them are \"magnificent\". In Moore's opinion, Daniell's \"fluid, sensitive use of washes\", testified by his early Bure Bridge, Aylsham, ranks him alongside William James M\u00fcller and David Roberts, and the drawings produced on his last tour \"reveal a vision that emulates that of David Roberts and exceeds that of Edward Lear\". Clifford identified Daniell's distinctively bold style and sense of draughtsmanship, but pointed out what he saw as weaknesses in some of the watercolours: a \u201cfear\u201d of using colour, the emptiness of some of the panoramic views, and an unsuitable use of coloured paper."]}, {"page": "List of museums in Bristol", "response": ["| Royal West of England Academy || 125px || Clifton || Bristol || Art || The Royal West of England Academy (RWA) is an art gallery.

It was not until 1950 that the building was returned to its original function after the intervention of the then Prime Minister, Clement Attlee. Among the paintings in the permanent collection are works by artists from the Newlyn, St Ives and Bloomsbury Schools. Paintings by George Swaish, Matthew Hale, Anne Redpath, Mary Fedden, Carel Weight, Bernard Dunstan and Elizabeth Blackadder are also valued additions to the collection. The building is a grade II* listed building constructed in 1857. The interiors are by Charles Underwood and fa\u00e7ade by JR Hirst, altered in 1912 by SS Reay and H Dare Bryan.

His association and friendship, however, with William James M\u00fcller, also a native of Bristol, induced him to give his undivided attention to water-colour painting, and his pictures, from the year 1849, formed no small attraction in the gallery in Pall Mall East. He adopted this change of art notwithstanding the fact that he had gained silver medals for bas-reliefs in 1837 and 1838 at the Society of Arts. His style of painting shows much of M\u00fcller's influence. Some of his most striking landscapes represent frost scenes. Among his works are: Post Haste, April Showers on the Eastern Coast, An old Lime-kiln, Kilgarren Castle, Winter Sunset, Old Salmon Trap on the Conway, The Environs of an Ancient Garden, 1852, A Frozen Ferry, 1853 (this and the previous picture received prizes from the Glasgow Art Union), Ferry on the Thames (at the 1862 International Exhibition), A Black Frost, Snow Storm, North Wales, Salmon Poaching, and On the River Dee, North Wales."]}, {"page": "Bristol School", "response": ["Around 1832\u201333 a new series of sketching meetings was started. This initially included William James M\u00fcller, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham, John Skinner Prout and Robert Tucker, according to Tucker's own account. The meetings later grew to include more artists, although relatively few surviving drawings have been identified, compared to the meetings of the 1820s, and by the 1830s the works of the Bristol School were less original. Other participants in the meetings probably included Samuel Jackson, Stephen C. Jones, James Baker Pyne, Henry Brittan Willis, W. Williams, Joseph Walter, George Arthur Fripp, Edmund Gustavus M\u00fcller, and William Evans. These sketching meetings may have lasted into the 1840s.", "William James M\u00fcller's biographer Nathaniel Neal Solly described the sketching meetings as a formal club, but some commentators believe he had confused them with the formation of the Bristol Society of Artists, which held its first exhibition in 1832 at the Bristol Institution. That exhibition included numerous works by Samuel Jackson, James Johnson, Nathan Cooper Branwhite and William James M\u00fcller.", "However, the 1832 exhibition of the Bristol Society of Artists included a number of works by artists of the Norwich School: John Sell Cotman, Miles Edmund Cotman and John Berney Crome. John Sell Cotman was to prove a greater influence on the later work of William James M\u00fcller than Danby and other Bristol School artists, despite M\u00fcller's having been apprenticed to John Baker Pyne during 1827\u201329/30.

In the mid\u00a01830s, probably in 1835, he moved to London where he developed his mature style. His landscapes now followed Turner in their colours and style of composition. Turner's influence can be seen for example in Clifton, Near Bristol, from the Avon (1837), which was exhibited at the Royal Academy. Pyne exhibited at the British Institution during 1833\u20131844 at the Royal West of England Academy in Bristol, and at the Royal Academy during 1836\u201341.

Here he was able to cultivate a natural impulse for originality and grandeur in the constant contemplation of nature in some of its wildest forms, and he produced some fine works, notably Traeth Mawr; his treatment of the mountain torrents and the cottage scenery of the neighbourhood was also remarkable.
