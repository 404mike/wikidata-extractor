Both Robbie and Foster were narrators of Granada's highly acclaimed schools programmes for the ITV network.\nShe then presented other Granada shows for the ITV network, including Emergency, First Post, Connections (as the original host, and in which Foster announced the prizes, before being replaced by Richard Madeley as the show moved to a prime-time slot), Hold Tight! (where she replaced the Selecter vocalist Pauline Black) and TX (where she starred alongside a young Tony Slattery). She was also an occasional presenter and expert guest in the early years of ITV's This Morning show.\nAs well as her work for Granada, Robbie also presented The Dodo Club, a children's wildlife programme produced by Channel Television between 1987 and 1990.She presented \"Video Active\" on BBC2 in 1987, 6 introductory guides to making home videos.She retired from television in the early 1990s and now works as a voice-over artist and occasionally in corporate events.

The same theme was used in the daytime version hosted by Sue Robbie and primetime version with Richard Madeley.", "In rounds one and three, contestants were asked general knowledge questions, which they could answer by buzzing in.  Each correct answer earned the contestant 10 points and revealed a picture clue on a 3\u00d73 gameboard (which in later series became a board of 10 screens).  The contestant who gave a correct answer would then have an opportunity to guess the connection between the pictures.  When the connection has been identified, the contestant who identified it wins bonus points (starting at 100 after the first two clues and decreasing by 10 for each additional clue) and the round ends. During the Sue Robbie era, round three would be played the same way for twice the points.", "During the Sue Robbie era, each departing contestant received a camera, and a charity of their choice received \u00a31 per point scored in all of their games.
