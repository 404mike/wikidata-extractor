Sinatra recorded it for his 1956 Capitol release Songs for Swingin' Lovers!, to an arrangement and orchestration by Nelson Riddle. Biographer John Frayn Turner writes: \"Not forgetting 'It Happened in Monterey', which had never sounded like that before or since\". Biographer Spencer Leigh notes the \"looseness of his phrasing in the second chorus\". Sinatra began performing it live. It features as the second track on his 1957 live album Sinatra '57 in Concert, and also appeared on the original UK pressing of Come Fly with Me as a replacement track for the banned On the Road to Mandalay."]}]}}
