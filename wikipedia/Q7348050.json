His appearance is vaguely similar to that of Dennis the Menace from the same magazine: he wears a black-and-red chequered jumper and black trousers, but takes better care of his hair than his equally mischievous counterpart. He also used to have a white tie, but it seems to have disappeared. Originally drawn by Ken Reid, Gordon Bell took over in 1959, but Roger dodged his way out of the Beano in 1960. He returned, drawn by Bob McGrath, in April 1961. Ken Reid was re-commissioned to draw the strip in 1962, and Robert Nixon when Reid left D. C. Thomson & Co. in 1964. When Nixon left in 1973, Tom Lavery began drawing the strip, who was then followed by Frank McDiarmid in 1976.", "Nixon continued drawing it until his death in October 2002, though due to the strips being drawn months in advance, his strips continued appearing in the Beano until the end of January 2003, when artist Barrie Appleby took over. He drew the strip until 2011, when he stopped to concentrate on Dennis and Gnasher, though Trevor Metcalfe drew a few strips in 2003 and 2004, and there have also been some Robert Nixon reprints during 2005 and 2006. Since Appleby stopped drawing Roger, the comic has run reprints of Robert Nixon strips from the 1980s. Along with the Nixon reprints, Roger's Dodge Diary was introduced on the second half of Roger's pages, where Beano readers can send in their own dodges. In each one, Roger says a good thing, a bad thing and the results of the dodge. When the Beano was revamped on 8 August 2012, Appleby started drawing Roger again and Roger's parents were made younger. In the 75th birthday issue released on 24 July 2013, Jamie Smart took over as artist. On 9 April 2014, Wayne Thompson replaced Jamie Smart as Roger's artist, until Barrie Appleby returned to draw the strip temporarily, before Wayne Thompson surprisingly returned.

New strips were eventually commissioned from Tom Lavery, followed by Peter Davidson and Robert Nixon. Ken H. Harrison drew the strip from 1989 until 1997, when Davidson resumed duties.

It first appeared in issue 586, dated 10 October 1953. The comic strip employed a caricature of English language spoken by American Indians, notably replacing the word \"the\" with \"um\". Baxendale dreamed him up claiming he was a mixture of Hiawatha and Dennis the Menace and gave him into the editing team. Unsure of the name, Baxendale gave it in to the then Beano editor under the working title 'Booster' before the strip was officially titled 'Little Plum, Your Redskin Chum' .History of the Beano: The Story So Far... They consisted of Plum, a ten-year-old member of the Smellyfoot tribe and the misadventures he got up to trying to prove himself a valuable member. After Baxendale left The Beano in 1962, Robert Nixon drew a few strips before Ron Spencer took over that same year. The strip originally finished in 1986, but it continued to appear in the Beano annuals up to 1994, and reappeared for a short time in 1998 under the name 'The Legend of Little Plum', drawn by Tom Paterson."]}, {"page": "Tom, Dick and Sally", "response": ["Tom, Dick and Sally was a comic strip in the UK comic The Beano between issue 1735 (dated 18 October 1975) and 2305 (20 September 1986). It was initially drawn by Dave Jenner, but Keith Reynolds drew it for much of its run.  Robert Nixon is also known to have drawn a number of episodes. Tom and Dick repeatedly tried to offload their responsibilities onto their younger sister Sally, and enjoy an easy life at her expense.

Upon return, Snooty's friends were replaced with new characters, some from discontinued Beano strips. Watkins stopped working on the series after issue 690 and would not return until 904, being replaced by Leo Baxendale, but Watkins' production would still be sporadic with the large story reprints-gap in the early 1960s. In 1968, Robert Nixon became the new creator, followed by Jimmy Glen from 1973 and Ken H. Harrison in 1988.

The first re-launch was drawn by Bob Dewar, and the second originally by David Parkins, who drew it for much of the mid-1990s, then Robert Nixon later on.

Throughout the strip, it showed her attempts to become the toughest character in The Beano. Finally, when about to confront Dennis the Menace himself Dennis simply waited until evening at which point Ivy, being a toddler, had simply fallen asleep. He then took her back to her house and remarked, very out of character, that she \"almost looked cute\".Beano Issue 2233 The popularity of the character led to the strip being expanded to two pages as of issue #2931 (19 September 1998). Later strips dropped the idea of her longing for toughness and instead concentrated on her hyperactivity and tantrums. Her popularity even grew to the point she was briefly featured in her own spin-off in which she would choose her favourite nightmares entitled Ivy's Favourite Nightmares.History of Beano page. 235", "Robert Nixon continued to draw Ivy until his death in 2002.  His successor as artist was Tony O'Donnell, who drew the strip in a very similar style to Nixon, making no major changes to the strip or characters. However, Trevor Metcalfe drew several strips during 2003 and 2004, in which Ivy was given a noticeably more childlike and less malicious personality, although again the strip's style was based on Nixon's.
