Midfielder Drew Richardson, a first-year scholar, joined Isthmian League Premier Division club Harlow Town on work experience for one month. Shinnie and Cornick scored in each half of Luton's 2\u20130 away win over Scunthorpe United, a result that saw them move one point behind league-leaders Portsmouth.
