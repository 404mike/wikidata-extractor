His translation of the Qur'an is one of the most widely known and used in the English-speaking world. A convert from Christianity, Pickthall was a novelist, esteemed by D. H. Lawrence, H. G. Wells, and E. M. Forster, as well as a journalist, headmaster, and political and religious leader.

Some modern scholars, however, assert that the Quran does not explicitly outline a doctrine or theory of saints. In the Quran, the adjective wal\u012b is applied to God, in the sense of him being the \"friend\" of all believers (Q2:257). However, particular Quranic verses were interpreted by early Islamic scholars to refer to a special, exalted group of holy people. These included : \"Surely God's friends (awliy\u0101a l-lahi): no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow,\" and , which refers to God's love for those who love him. Additionally, some scholars interpreted , \"Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger, they are with those unto whom God hath shown favor: the prophets and the \u1e63id\u012bq\u012bna and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they,\" to carry a reference to holy people who were not prophets and were ranked below the latter. The word \u1e63id\u012bq\u012bna in this verse literally connotes \"the truthful ones\" or \"the just ones,\" and was often interpreted by the early Islamic thinkers in the sense of \"saints,\" with the famous Quran translator Marmaduke Pickthall rendering it as \"saints\" in their interpretations of the scripture. Furthermore, the Quran referred to the miracles of saintly people who were not prophets like Khidr (-) and the People of the Cave (-), which also led many early scholars to deduce that a group of venerable people must exist who occupy a rank below the prophets but are nevertheless exalted by God.

Through his ministry, Jesus is seen as a precursor to Muhammad. In the Quran (Q4:157\u2013159) it is said that Jesus was not killed but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers, and that he was raised into the heavens while still alive by God.: \"And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary, Allah\u2019s messenger \u2014 They slew him not nor crucified, but it appeared so unto them\" (4:157) by Marmaduke Pickthall. According to most classic Sunni and Twelver Shi'ite interpretations of these verses, the likeness of Jesus was cast upon a substitute (most often one of the apostles), who was crucified in Jesus' stead.; . The substitution theory was criticized and rejected by the Sunni Quran commentator Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (1150\u20131210); see . According to Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi (d. 1037), the substitution theory was also applied to the death of Ali ibn Abi Talib by the semi-legendary 7th-century figure Abdallah ibn Saba'; see . However, some medieval Muslims (a.o., the  writing under the name of al\u2010Mufaddal ibn Umar al\u2010Ju'fi, the Brethren of Purity, Isma'ili philosophers like Abu Hatim al-Razi, Abu Tammam, Ja'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman, Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani and Ibrahim al-Hamidi, and the Sunni mystic al-Ghazali) affirmed the historicity of Jesus' crucifixion, holding the docetic view that although Jesus' human form (his body) had died on the cross, his true divine nature (his spirit) had survived and ascended unto heaven, so that his death was only an appearance.On the writings attributed to al\u2010Mufaddal ibn Umar al\u2010Ju'fi, see .

This type of interpretation of Quran 4:157\u2013159 was specifically rejected by the Sunni Quran commentator al-Baydawi (d. 1319); see . Nevertheless, to Muslims it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. There is no mention of his resurrection on the third day, and his death plays no special role in Islamic theories of salvation.. However, Jesus is a central figure in Islamic eschatology: Muslims believe that he will return to Earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him."]}, {"page": "Abdullah Quilliam", "response": ["at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking.
