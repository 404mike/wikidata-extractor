The name radical orthodoxy was chosen initially since it was a more \"snappy\" title for the book series\u2014initially Milbank considered the movement to be \"postmodern critical Augustinianism\", emphasizing the use of a reading of Augustine of Hippo influenced by the insights of postmodernism in the work of the group. The name was also chosen in opposition to certain strands of so-called radical theology, for example those of John Shelby Spong; those strands asserted a highly liberal version of Christian faith where certain doctrines, for example the Trinity  were denied in an attempt to respond to modernity: in contrast to this, radical orthodoxy attempted to show how the orthodox interpretation of Christian faith (as given primarily in the ecumenical creeds) was the more radical response to contemporary issues and more rigorous and intellectually sustainable."]}, {"page": "Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford", "response": ["*Regius Professor of Divinity \u2014 Graham Ward (since 2012)"]}, {"page": "Westcott House, Cambridge", "response": ["*Graham Ward, current Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford University"]}, {"page": "List of thinkers influenced by deconstruction", "response": ["*Graham Ward: Ward had been influenced by Derrida, Foucault, \u017di\u017eek, and others.
