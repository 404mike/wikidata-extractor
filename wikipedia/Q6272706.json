He began teaching at the University of Wales, Lampeter as lecturer in Theology & Religious Studies in 1991 before moving to Bristol in 1996.\nCampbell's main research work is on Second Temple Judaism in general and on the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran in particular. Because these Scrolls have such important repercussions across several interrelated disciplines, he is also interested in the emergence of both Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity out of the Judaism of the Second Temple period (circa 515 BCE - 70 CE). He has further interests in the theological impact of academic study of the Bible and of Jewish and Christian history on Judaism and Christianity in the contemporary world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jonathan Campbell", "response": ["Jonathan Campbell may refer to:", "* Jonathan Campbell (theologian) (born 1964), professor of religion", "* Jonathan Campbell (soccer) (born 1993), American soccer player"]}]}}
