Aristotle, judging from his surviving books, does not seem to have access to any works by Thales, although he probably had access to works of other authors about Thales, such as Herodotus, Hecataeus, Plato etc., as well as others whose work is now extinct. It was Aristotle's express goal to present Thales' work not because it was significant in itself, but as a prelude to his own work in natural philosophy.See Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b 1\u201327. Geoffrey Kirk and John Raven, English compilers of the fragments of the Pre-Socratics, assert that Aristotle's \"judgments are often distorted by his view of earlier philosophy as a stumbling progress toward the truth that Aristotle himself revealed in his physical doctrines.\"Kirk and Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers, Second Edition (Cambridge University Press, 1983) 3.

He took Physiology with Chemistry and Zoology for the first two years, including lectures by Nobel Laureate E.D. Adrian. For Part II of the tripos he decided to focus on physiology instead of zoology. Nevertheless, he participated in a zoological expedition to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco led by John Pringle in 1934.

Unusually for his time, Kirk attained a series of promotions in his first decade as a tenured academic: he was made a university lecturer in 1952 and a reader in 1961. The 1950s and 1960s witnessed the publication of several monographs which helped to establish his international reputation as a scholar of archaic Greece: he edited the fragments of the philosopher Heraclitus (1954), wrote a study on the poems of Homer (1962), and, together with classicist John Raven, co-edited a volume on pre-Socratic philosophy (1958). He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1959 at just thirty eight years of age.", "Kirks's reputation as a classical scholar was based initially on his work on pre-Socratic philosophy. His first book (Heraclitus: the Cosmic Fragments, 1954) was well received among the scholars community. Gregory Vlastos, a leading interpreter of Plato, remarked that it \"compell[ed] one to reconsider many things one has previously taken for granted\". Co-authored with John Raven, his 1959 book The Presocratic Philosophers became, in the words of Hellenist Hugh Lloyd-Jones, \"an invaluable substitute\" for previous treatments of the topic."]}, {"page": "Raven (surname)", "response": ["*John Raven (1914\u20131980), English classical scholar and amateur botanist, father of Andrew and Sarah"]}, {"page": "Guy Clutton-Brock", "response": ["Clutton-Brock was born at Lake View, Green Lane, Ruislip, Middlesex, son of stockbroker Henry Alan Clutton-Brock and Rosa Gertrude Eleanor (n\u00e9e Bowles).https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-59788 His uncle was the writer Arthur Clutton-Brock.Burke's Landed Gentry 14th edition, ed.
