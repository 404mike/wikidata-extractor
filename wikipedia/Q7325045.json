According to author of When Cultures Collide: Leading Across Cultures, Richard D. Lewis, the phrase is a form of expression of the relaxed attitude in Australian culture. Anna Wierzbicka comments that the expression illustrates important parts of Australian culture, including: \"amiability, friendliness, an expectation of shared attitudes (a proneness to easy 'mateship'), jocular toughness, good humour, and, above all, casual optimism\". She concludes that along with \"good on you\", the expressions reflect the \"national character\" and \"prevailing ethos\" of Australia."]}, {"page": "Lewis Model", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard D.
