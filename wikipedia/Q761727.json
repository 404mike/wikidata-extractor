Perkin's second marriage was in 1866, to Alexandrine Caroline, daughter of Helman Mollwo. They had one son (Frederick Mollwo Perkin) and four daughters. All three sons became chemists."]}, {"page": "Luteolin", "response": ["Luteolin is the principal yellow dye compound that is obtained from the plant Reseda luteola, which has been used as a source of the dye since at least the first millennium B.C.  Luteolin was first isolated in pure form, and named, in 1829 by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul.  Chevreul named luteolin on p. 144:  \"J'ai fait des recherches sur la composition de la gaude, j'ai obtenu le principe colorant critalis\u00e9 par sublimation; je l'ai nomm\u00e9 lut\u00e9olin.\" (I have done some research on the composition of weld; I obtained the principal colorant [which I] crystallized via sublimation; I have called it \"luteolin\".)However, Perkin claimed (without citing a source) that Chevreul had isolated luteolin as early as 1814\u20131815.  See:    The luteolin empirical formula was determined by the Austrian chemists Heinrich Hlasiwetz and Leopold Pfaundler in 1864. ; see pp. 44\u201345.  Hlasiwetz and Pfaundler melted quercitrin with potassium carbonate.  Among the reaction's products, they found paradatiscetin, whose empirical formula they determined to be C15H10O6 (p. 94).  They concluded that although luteolin and paradatiscetin were isomeric (i.e., had the same empirical formula), they were distinct compounds. From p. 94:  \"Das Luteolin scheint demnach wohl als isomer oder metamer mit unserer Substanz betrachtet werden zu k\u00f6nnen.  Eine Identit\u00e4t beider liegt jedoch nicht vor, denn an einer Probe Luteolin fanden wir die charakteristischen Farben-reactionen nicht, welche das Paradatiscetin kaum verwechseln lassen.\"  (Luteolin thus seems to be able to be regarded perhaps as an isomer or metamer of our substance [viz, paradatiscetin].  However, the two are evidently not identical, for upon a test of luteolin, we did not find the characteristic color reactions, which hardly allows paradatiscetin to be confused [with it].)  In 1896, the English chemist Arthur George Perkin proposed the correct structure for luteolin.  See p. 803.  Perkin's proposed structure for luteolin was confirmed in 1900 when the Polish-Swiss chemist Stanislaw Kostanecki (1860\u20131910) and his students A. R\u00f3\u017cycki and J. Tambor synthesized luteolin."]}, {"page": "Perkin Transactions", "response": ["Perkin Transactions is a scientific journal devoted to organic chemistry published from 1997 to 2002 by the Royal Society of Chemistry.
