After a disappointing season in 1893 when their batting failed on Oval pitches rendered fiery by several dry winters and springs, Kingsmill Key took over and led Surrey to further titles in 1894, 1895 and 1899. Leading players in these years were batsman Bobby Abel and a trio of top bowlers: George Lohmann, Bill Lockwood and Tom Richardson. In 1899, Abel's unbeaten 357 helped Surrey to a mammoth total of 811 against Somerset; both scores remain club records over 100 years later.", "*  Kingsmill Key"]}, {"page": "E. W. Bastard", "response": ["Bastard was Somerset's leading wicket-taker again in 1885, claiming 25 wickets. In his first match for the county that summer, he recorded his second ten-wicket match. Facing Hampshire in Taunton, Bastard claimed eight wickets in the first innings, and a further three in the second as Somerset recorded their only win of the year. His next match for the county was also against Hampshire, this time in Southampton. Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture, and after batting first reached 117. In the Hampshire response, a contemporary match report recorded that Bastard \"did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants, taking eight of the ten wickets at a cost of only 59 runs\".Roebuck (1991), p. 30. Despite his performance, Hampshire passed Somerset's total and had a first innings lead of 45 runs. Somerset scored 166 in their second innings, leaving Hampshire requiring 122 to win. Bastard bowled 27 overs in the second innings, but failed to add to his wicket tally, and Hampshire won the match by eight wickets. Bastard's performances during 1885 saw him selected in two games for the Gentlemen during the Scarborough Festival. The team was a young one, as well as three of his Oxford team-mates from that season, Page, Kingsmill Key and Tim O'Brien, there were a number of players from the Cambridge team chosen. Bastard claimed five wickets in the first innings of the match against I Zingari, but failed to take any against the Players. In 1885, his 62 first-class wickets was the eighteenth highest among bowlers in the country."]}, {"page": "Leslie Gay", "response": ["An intermittent cricketer who had left the first-class game by 1904, Gay kept wicket for Cambridge in the Varsity match against Oxford University in 1892 and 1893, and after four games for Somerset in 1894 he was picked for the 1894-95 tour to Australia under Andrew Stoddart. Chosen only for the first Test match, he scored 33 and four and took three catches with one stumping. He then disappeared from first-class cricket until a brief nine-match return with Hampshire in 1900.

He was also a medium-paced bowler with a curl from leg and a break from the off, could keep a good length and was to be relied on. In the field he was hard-working and excellent, being safe in any position.\" Jack Hobbs claimed in 1935 that Page could bowl the googly while at the University in the 1880s, some time before Bernard Bosanquet is credited with the delivery's invention. Hobbs' source was Kingsmill Key, a contemporary of Page at Oxford and later a captain of Surrey; however, Key stated that Page merely bowled it as a distraction and never used it in a first-class match."]}, {"page": "Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)", "response": ["Bosanquet is remembered as the inventor of the googly, a delivery designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, it appears to be a leg break, but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that expected, behaving as an off break instead. However, Bosanquet was a pace bowler in his university days. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his bowling from this period as \"very useful\u00a0... but that was all, and had he kept to his original style real distinction at cricket would only have come to him through his batting\". Furthermore, he disliked bowling quickly, believing he was destined only to be used as a last resort and that he would have little success as a fast bowler.Bosanquet, p. 364. Consequently, Bosanquet decided to change his style. According to his own account, his inspiration came in the mid-1890s,Bosanquet, p. 363. from a table-top game he often played called Twisti-Twosti; the object was to bounce a tennis ball on a table so that it could not be caught by an opposing player. Bosanquet began to experiment with ways of throwing the ball so that, after pitching, it turned and spun in an unexpected direction, without his opponent detecting any difference in the delivery. Finding he could do this successfully, he began to practise using the same method to bowl in a form of soft-ball cricket and then in the cricket nets with a hard ball, but did not at the time take his discovery seriously. It was not until 1899 or 1900 that Bosanquet began to practise in earnest, and developed an orthodox leg break in the nets to complement his new style of delivery, which spun in the same direction as an off break. During the lunch breaks in Oxford matches, he would often bowl to the best opposing batsmen in the nets, delivering several leg breaks, followed by an off break, without changing his bowling action; the ball would sometimes hit the bemused batsman on the knee, to the amusement of spectators. A slightly different version of events was provided by the son of Louise Bosanquet, Bernard's cousin, who claimed in 1965 that Bosanquet conceived the idea in 1890 and practised bowling to Louise with a tennis ball from 1893 onwards.Green, p. 181. There were later suggestions that other cricketers invented the googly before Bosanquet. In 1935, Jack Hobbs wrote that Kingsmill Key, a former captain of Surrey, told him that the googly was invented by an Oxford student, Herbert Page, in the 1880s. Key claimed that Page bowled the delivery regularly, but never used it in a first-class match."]}, {"page": "William Rashleigh (cricketer)", "response": ["Rashleigh was the son of farmer and cricketer William Boys Rashleigh. He played in the Tonbridge School XI from 1882 to 1885, and made his first-class debut for Kent on 24 August 1885.  Going up to Brasenose College, Oxford, that autumn, he gained his blue as a freshman. In July 1886 he joined Kingsmill Key in a stand of 243, a record first-wicket partnership at that time in a Varsity Match; both batsmen hit centuries, but no other batsman in the innings reached double figures.University match 1886 scorecard Retrieved 20 September 2012 Altogether in first-class cricket he passed one hundred in nine innings.
