The first was a clergyman near Cambridge; through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers, but the tuition was not what he needed. He was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17.

As the demise of the Ottoman Empire appeared to be approaching, the advocacy of restorationism increased. At the same time, the visit of John Nelson Darby, the founder of a variant of premillennialism called dispensationalism, to the United States catalyzed a new movement. This was expressed at the Niagara Bible Conference in 1878, which issued a 14-point proclamation (relying on Luke 12:35\u201340, 17:26\u201330, 18:8 Acts 15:14\u201317, 2 Thessalonians 2:3\u20138, 2 Timothy 3:1\u20135, and Titus 1:11\u201315), including:", "* Charles Simeon"]}, {"page": "William Scoresby", "response": ["From 1839 to 1846 Scoresby was vicar of Bradford, Yorkshire, a \"large, industrial, dissenting parish\", also described as an \"ever-expanding, raucous, restless industrial conurbation\",  across.

In 1807 he resigned his fellowship at St John's on being elected as the Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity at Cambridge and began presenting lectures there on Higher Criticism.  He was the first person in the theological school there to give his lectures in English rather than the traditional Latin.Stephen Neill The Interpretation of the New Testament, p. 5 In 1808 he was awarded the Oxford degree of Doctor of Divinity, before in 1816 he was appointed the bishop of Llandaff in Glamorgan, where he succeeded Bishop Richard Watson.

With a scholarship from the Elland Society Marsden attended Hull Grammar School, where he became associated with Joseph Milner and the reformist William Wilberforce, and after two years, he matriculated, at the age of 25, at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He abandoned his degree studies to respond to the call of the evangelical leader Charles Simeon for service in overseas missions.

His visitors included John Wesley and Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. His sermons were often met with 'strange convulsions' in the congregation, and people falling down as if dead, described in detail in Wesley's journals in 1758-9.
