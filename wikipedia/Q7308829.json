In his second match, against Cambridge University at Fenners in 1930, he made an unbeaten 75 which remained his highest first-class score. He played in 12 first-class games for Somerset in 1930, but only a handful over the next three years.Northway reappeared in first-class cricket for Northamptonshire in the 1936 season. Northamptonshire was a very weak side at this time, finishing last in the County Championship and failing to record a victory for four years from May 1935 to May 1939. Northway opened the batting for more than half of the matches in the 1936 season, batting alongside Fred Bakewell, the England Test batsman and the county's one genuine first-class player. In 17 matches he scored just 429 runs, with just one score of over 50 \u2013 a 58 against his former county, Somerset, at Bath, when he batted for three hours.Northway is perhaps best remembered for the tragic end to his cricket career and that of his opening partner Bakewell. Travelling home from the final match of the season, where Northamptonshire had made a surprisingly good showing against the season's County Champions, Derbyshire, Northway's car overturned on the A6 road at Kibworth, Leicestershire. Northway was flung from the car and killed, his body being found in a roadside ditch. Bakewell, who had made an unbeaten 241 in Northamptonshire's second innings, had his arm crushed and despite optimism over several following years he never played first-class cricket again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Thompson and Smith finished playing after World War I and, during the inter-war period, Northamptonshire were regularly one of the weaker championship sides. This was exacerbated when Vallance Jupp declined due to age and, despite the arrival of Nobby Clark, a young left arm fast bowler from Huntingdonshire  who burst onto the scene at the age of 20 in 1922 with 20 wickets at an average of 17.10 and Fred Bakewell, an exciting batsman who regularly exceeded 1000 runs a season,  Northamptonshire could only finish above second from last four times between 1923 and 1948, finishing last every year from 1934 to 1938 and enduring a run of 99 matches from 14 May 1935 to 29 May 1939 without a single championship victory, a record that has never been beaten and doesn't look like being beaten in the future. Things got worse for Northamptonshire during this time when Bakewell's career ended due to a broken arm in a car crash that also resulted in the fatality of teammate, Reginald Northway."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Reginald Northway (1929\u20131933) 17 matches CA"]}]}}
