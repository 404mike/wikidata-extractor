He had also previously held the Guinness World Record as the world's fastest violin player for four years. The difficulty of comparing and monitoring \"fastest musician\" attempts with regard to the quality of the renditions later led Guinness World Records to retire and no longer monitor records of this type.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Lee", "response": ["* Ben Lee (born 1978), Australian musician and actor", "* Ben Lee (violinist) (born 1980), British electric violinist and composer"]}, {"page": "Linzi Stoppard", "response": ["At the end of 2007 Linzi joined Ben Lee to form a heavy-metal duo known as 'FUSE'.

They satirically timed themselves purposefully playing random fast notes before declaring they had broken the world record. In April 2019, the duo similarly called out Vov Dylan, who was awarded the title of World's Fastest Violinist by the Australian Book of Records, concluding that Dylan's performance of \"Bumblebee\" was worse than Lee's."]}]}}
