In his second game, he scored what would later turn out to be his only goal for the club during a 3\u20130 victory over Nottingham Forest. Having helped the club to win promotion to the First Division in 1921, he struggled to make an impact on the side in his second year due to the performances of Billy Grimshaw and left the club in May 1923, signing for Second Division side Manchester United. There he played as back-up to Joe Spence, but he did not make his debut until April 1924, playing in the last six matches of the 1923\u201324 season, as the forward line was shuffled to cover the absent James Miller. His only two goals came in the 2\u20132 draw at home to Clapton Orient on 21 April 1924. Spence was ever-present in the 1924\u201325 season as Manchester United were promoted back to the First Division, and Evans took the opportunity to leave the club for Southern League side Pontypridd in August 1925."]}, {"page": "Jock Miller", "response": ["#redirectJames Miller (1920s footballer)"]}]}}
