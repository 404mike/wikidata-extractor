Moving to the nearby and smaller Isle of Soay, she eventually bought and ran her own croft. Her life on the island provided the basis for seven books published between 1959 and 1978, although allegedly, some of her neighbours later felt that the somewhat comical characters on Beckwith's fictional island of Bruach were too close to real persons, causing Beckwith to become something of a persona non grata in her former home. She moved to the Isle of Man in 1962 and died on 3 January 2004 aged 87.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ellesmere Port", "response": ["* Lillian Beckwith (1916\u20132004) author, born and grew up in Ellesmere Port the daughter of a grocer as chronicled in her book About My Father's Business"]}, {"page": "2004 in literature", "response": ["*January 3 \u2013 Lillian Beckwith, English novelist (born 1916)"]}, {"page": "2004 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 3 January \u2013 Lillian Beckwith, writer (born 1916)"]}, {"page": "Beckwith", "response": ["* Lillian Beckwith, English author"]}, {"page": "A Common Reader", "response": ["A Common Reader's in-house publishing imprint, the Akadine Press, initiated in 1996, republished over 60 out-of-print books by authors such as Lillian Beckwith, Alice Thomas Ellis, Barbara Holland, Reynolds Price, and John Ciardi.
