He treated the theme of Sir Richard Grenville before Tennyson thought of using it, with much force and vitality. Indeed, Tennyson's own praise of Massey's work is still its best eulogy, for the Laureate found in him a poet of fine lyrical impulse, and of a rich half-Oriental imagination. The inspiration of his poetry is a combination of his vast knowledge based on travels, research and experiences; he was a patriotic humanist to the core. His poem \"The Merry, Merry May\" was set to music in 1894 by the composer Cyril Rootham and then in a popular song by composer Christabel Baxendale."]}, {"page": "Christabel", "response": ["*Christabel Baxendale (1886\u20131953), English violinist and composer"]}, {"page": "List of compositions for viola: A to B", "response": ["* Christabel Baxendale (1886\u2013?)"]}, {"page": "Baxendale", "response": ["* Christabel Baxendale (1886\u20131953?), English violinist and composer"]}, {"page": "Kathleen Baxendale", "response": ["#redirect Christabel Baxendale"]}]}}
