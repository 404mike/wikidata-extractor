It was with Pill that Shea gained his first cap for Wales, against the post-war touring New Zealand Army. in 1919, like many Pill players, he switched to Newport RFC, the Harriers first-class rivals. The next year he was selected to play for Wales against England at St. Helens in the Five Nations Championship. Unsurprisingly for teams meeting for the first time since the end of the First World War, both teams contained many new caps. It was in this match that Shea would make history by scoring a try, conversion, drop goal, and penalty goal, the first player to do so at an international level.Griffiths (1988), pg 74. In a rain swept match, Shea opened the scoring in the first half with a penalty goal against the wind. England responded with a try and conversion, both from Harold Day, to take the first half 5\u20133. Within five minutes of the restart, Shea had drop kicked Wales back into the lead. With twenty minutes remaining, and the Welsh forwards in command, Shea broke through the English defence to score a try under the posts which he easily converted. Wick Powell then scored a second try for Wales, before Shea finished the match with another drop goal, for a convincing Welsh win.Griffiths (1988), pg 75."]}, {"page": "List of cricket and rugby union players", "response": ["| Harold Day"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|546||Harold Day||wing ||1920-01-17||v Wales at Swansea"]}, {"page": "Day (surname)", "response": ["* Harold Day, English rugby player", "* Harold Day, Welsh World War I flying ace"]}, {"page": "Doug Prentice", "response": ["Prentice began his rugby career with local side Westleigh, at the time Leicester was strictly an invitation only club and his debut for side came on 26 November 1923 away to Neath, Tigers lost 37\u20136 but Prentice scored one of Leicester's two tries.  Prentice quickly established himself in the Leicester's first choice side playing 24 of the season's 30 remaining games.  Forwards' positions were not specialized in this period and he is recorded simply as playing \"forward\" until the 1927\u201328 season.  From then onward Prentice is recorded as having mainly played prop for Leicester, despite his international caps coming at either Number 8 or Lock. Prentice was a regular try scorer for Leicester scoring 7 tries in his first season and 8 in 31 games the next.
