He was a left-wing Labour Party politician.\nZilliacus spoke nine languages fluently and international issues absorbed much of his energy, both as an official of the League of Nations between the wars, and as a member of the House of Commons in the post-war period. He was widely considered to have had communist sympathies, this led him into conflict with the Labour Party leadership and in 1949 he was expelled from the party. In 1950 he lost his seat in parliament, he was re-admitted by Labour in 1952, and returned to the Commons in 1955.\nZilliacus campaigned for less spending on weapons. He was a founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and opposed the Vietnam War.
