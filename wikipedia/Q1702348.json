Rae was brought up in the Sighthill area of the city before moving to Livingston as a teenager. John and his other five siblings were encouraged by their father and mother, both jazz musicians and educators, to pursue a career in music from an early age. When he was fourteen he attended a weekly jazz workshop under the drumming tutelage of Bill Kyle and Mike Travis. There he met saxophonist Tommy Smith. Under Smith, they won the Edinburgh International Jazz Festival Best Group award in 1981 and a year later Rae won Best Group under his own name. Rae was soon performing around Edinburgh and Scotland in a quartet with Tommy Smith. In 1982 he recorded for the first time on Smith's debut recording Giant Strides in a trio format featuring Rae, Smith and bassist Alan Taylor. Rae then went on to tour and perform around Europe with a group under the musical direction of Johnny Keating and spent the next three years living and playing around the world in a variety of musical settings that included Soviet and American cruise liners, before moving to New York in 1984.

His father Ivor had secured a residency at the newly opened Mecca Locarno club in Hull, and Basil spent his time between London and Hull. In Hull he befriended local musician Keith Herd and began working on experimental pieces, \"soundtracks for unmade films\". In London he lived with songwriters Jimmy Jaques and Pat Ryan, and contributed heavily to the Johnny Keating album 'The Keating Sound'. He also produced material for the De Wolfe library using the talents of young session musicians such as Big Jim Sullivan, Jimmy Page and Tubby Hayes. In 1967, the Arts Council awarded him a grant to purchase a Nagra tape recorder.  This he used to collect ambient sounds, animal noises at London Zoo and the voices of autistic children. The controversial recording of autistic children came about because of his wife who worked as a teacher at a special ed school in a little valley in Switzerland in the city of Shermat. This school was inhabited only by autistic children and their teachers and caregivers. He noticed from days when he picked his wife up from work that the children would communicate through musical phrases \"I was fascinated by the sounds they make when they tried to communicate\" \"the melodies that they sing, no normal, with the greatest respect, human mind, could think of such intervals as they pitch and sing and the flood it comes out with and its emotional.\" Kirchin experimented with slowing down the recordings to reveal \"Little boulders of sound\". \"It's gonna sound quite ridiculous but theres a certain corner in Zurich that when it rains and the rains come around this corner if you have the ability to do so you can slow it down to 834ths of a second its a whole symphony orchestra\" Mistry, Pritti, \"Basil Kirchin: The Forgotten Genius of UK Music\", BBC News, 15 Feb 2017  \"Take birdsong: all those harmonics you can't hear are brought down \u2013 sounds that human ears have never heard before\". This he explained was the Worlds Within Worlds, and was a part of his quantum concept of time which he believed \"there are several universes going on at the same time,\" \"So, like a fly's world is completely different to our world, it moves at a completely different speed. And therefore if you speed up or slow down sound you can find a way into these parallel universes.\" Through his imaginary film scores he was able to find work composing for horror and scifi films which helped to finance his experimentations with sounds were partly financed by composing film music for Catch Us If You Can (1965), The Shuttered Room (1967), The Strange Affair (1968), I Start Counting (1969) and The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971). The use of his music in films exposed him to audiences and his clipped up and distorted sounds did very well at complementing the disturbing visual images within the horror and scifi genres.Williams, Richard, \"Basil Kirchin: the first painter of music\", The Guardian. 16 February 2017"]}, {"page": "List of songs about Paris", "response": ["* \"Paris\" by Johnny Keating & 27 Men"]}, {"page": "Welcome to My Love", "response": ["#\"Theme From \"Hotel\"\" (Johnny Keating, Robert Quine) - 2:36"]}, {"page": "2015 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 28 || Johnny Keating || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 87 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Scottish || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Composer || "]}, {"page": "John Keating (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Johnny Keating"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2015", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 28 || Johnny Keating || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 87 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Scottish || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Composer || "]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*28 May \u2013 Johnny Keating, 87, musician."]}, {"page": "2015 in British music", "response": ["*28 May \u2013 Johnny Keating, Scottish musician, songwriter and arranger, 87"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2015", "response": ["*Johnny Keating, 87, British musician (\"Theme from Z-Cars\")."]}, {"page": "Bud Shank Plays Music from Today's Movies", "response": ["# \"This Year\" (Johnny Keating, (Johnnny Worth) - 2:53"]}, {"page": "The World We Know (Stan Kenton album)", "response": ["# \"This Hotel\" (Johnny Keating, Richard Quine) - 2:32"]}, {"page": "List of UK top-ten singles in 1962", "response": ["|Johnny Keating & His Orchestra", "|align=\"left\"|Johnny Keating & His Orchestra"]}, {"page": "Stan Reynolds (musician)", "response": ["Reynolds began his musical career when he toured with the Tommy Sampson Orchestra at age 14.
