He was born in the Towy Valley in Carmarthenshire and went to Llandeilo Grammar School.\nAfter studying at Jesus College, Oxford and receiving a doctorate from the University of Oxford, he lectured at the University of Wales, Swansea from 1957 to 1978, rising to become Professor.  In 1978, he returned to Oxford University as Jesus Professor of Celtic and also became a Professorial Fellow of Jesus College.  He was appointed as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1983, having delivered the Academy's Sir John Rhys Memorial Lecture in 1977, named in honour of the first Oxford Celtic Professor.  He retired in 1996.\nHis particular research interest was early Celtic culture throughout Europe, dealing with its relationship with that of the classical world, and in the history of the Celtic languages and the early literatures of Wales and Ireland.  A volume of essays on these topics by fellow Celticists was published in honour of his 65th birthday in 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celtic languages", "response": ["* Lusitanian, spoken in the area between the Douro and Tagus rivers of western Iberia (a region straddling the present border of Portugal and Spain). Known from only five inscriptions and various place names. It is an Indo-European language and some scholars have proposed that it may be a para-Celtic language, which evolved alongside Celtic or formed a dialect continuum or sprachbund with Tartessian and Gallaecian. This is tied to a theory of an Iberian origin for the Celtic languages. It is also possible that the Q-Celtic languages alone, including Goidelic, originated in western Iberia (a theory that was first put forward by Edward Lhuyd in 1707) or shared a common linguistic ancestor with Lusitanian.Unity in Diversity, Volume 2: Cultural and Linguistic Markers of the Concept Editors: Sabine Asmus and Barbara Braid. Google Books. Secondary evidence for this hypothesis has been found in research by biological scientists, who have identified (1) deep-rooted similarities in human DNA found precisely in both the former Lusitania and Ireland, and; (2) the so-called \"Lusitanian distribution\" of animals and plants unique to western Iberia and Ireland. Both phenomena are now generally thought to have resulted from human emigration from Iberia to Ireland, in the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic eras. Other scholars see greater linguistic affinities between Lusitanian, proto-Gallo-Italic (particularly with Ligurian) and Old European.The inscription of Cabe\u00e7o das Fr\u00e1guas revisited.
