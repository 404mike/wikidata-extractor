The object of the school was to provide a liberal education, with fees a fraction of those charged by public schools. Tolerance of non-conformist denominations such as Methodism and Roman Catholicism informed the school's ethos, and the school has always remained independent of the Church of England. Brereton's son became the first headmaster of the school. In contrast to the largely classical education offered by many of the public schools of the time, the school always maintained a focus on scientific and technological education. A strong sporting programme was believed to build character. Extensions over the next few years included a sanatorium in 1890 (now the music school) and a swimming-bath block in 1896. In 1900 a \u00a34,000 (\u00a3400,000 in 2010) science block was opened by Lord Barnard with Brooke Foss Westcott, Bishop of Durham in attendance.Full text of \"Life and letters of Brooke Foss Westcott, D.D., D.C.L., sometime Bishop of Durham\"  The building is now inhabited by Tees and Dale houses."]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people in education", "response": ["*Joseph Lloyd Brereton (University) founder of schools and of Cavendish College, Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Massingham railway station", "response": ["A driving force behind the building of the Lynn & Fakenham railway line was the Reverend Joseph Lloyd Brereton of Little Massingham.
