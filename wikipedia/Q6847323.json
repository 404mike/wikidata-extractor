Jim Phillips, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed each year between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an English touring team in 1897\u201398. During two of the matches he umpired, Phillips no-balled Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called C. B. Fry, a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. This was the second of three occasions in 1898 that Fry was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no-balled Fry and Frank Hopkins. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for throwing in 1899.Birley, p. 176."]}, {"page": "Francis Hopkins (disambiguation)", "response": ["Francis or Frank Hopkins may also refer to:", "*Frank Hopkins (1865\u20131951), American professional horseman", "*Frank Hopkins (Royal Navy officer) (1910\u20131990), officer in the Royal Navy", "*Frank Hopkins (cricketer) (1875\u20131930), English cricketer", "*Frank Hopkins (footballer) (1909\u20131960), Australian rules footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Frank Hopkins (1898\u20131903) : F.
