Thomas exhibited at the 1870 exhibition. Seward studied at Cardiff's College of Art and later designed the town's new Free Library on The Hayes. Both became Presidents of the Cardiff Naturalists' Society and when Thomas inherited a house on The Walk in 1880 this also became a place for intellectual discussion. Seward tried unsuccessfully to establish an art institution in Cardiff to represent the whole of Wales. Exhibitions were held in 1884 and 1885 to raise money for a headquarters for the Cambrian Academy. Instead, Seward and a group of artists created the South Wales Art Society in 1888, with an annual exhibition and lecture programme.", "To help fund a new Free Library a second Fine Art and Industrial Exhibition took place in Cardiff's Drill Hall in 1881. T. H. Thomas and Cardiff painters B. S. Marks and Richard Short were on the organising committee. The event attracted further donations to the town's art collection, including the entire collection of William Menelaus after his death in 1882. In 1883 the National Eisteddfod visited Cardiff and Thomas organised the art and craft exhibition and competition, the largest ever event of its kind in Wales at the time. Local painter Edgar Thomas came to the attention and the Marquess of Bute sponsored his continuing art education as a result.", "The South Wales Art Society (SWAS) was formed in 1888 by a group of Cardiff-based members of the art scene, including artists T. H. Thomas and Parker Hagarty, art collector James Pyke Thompson, architects J. A. Sant and Edwin Seward and watercolourist Clarence Waite. SWAS planned to have an annual exhibition, a lecture programme and a sketching club and \"offering to those who admire or appreciate, rather than practise, a means of cultivating a taste for Art\"."]}, {"page": "19th century in ichnology", "response": ["* T.
