Sterling once explained: \"Although I had never been to sea in a storm, and had never even seen fishermen, I somehow understood that song of ' The Three Fishers' by instinct. On reading the poem over for the first time no one could know from the opening that the men would necessarily be drowned. Therefore it was a story. But there is a natural tendency to anticipate an unhappy ending; hence it was customary to begin the song so mournfully that everybody realised from the very start what the end was going to be. Madame Sainton-Dolby, for instance, used to sing it sorrowfully from the first note to the last. I had never seen or known of anyone who was drowned, but that mysterious instinct was so strong that I could not foreshadow the finish. When, therefore, I started, I always made the first verse quite bright. I must believe it was the true way, since both the poet and composer endorsed my rendering of it.\"Harold Simpson, A Century Of Ballads 1810-1910, Their Composers & Singers, Mills & Boon, Limited London, Circa 1911 According to a text by Harold Simpson, when Sterling finished performing the song at her London debut, \"there was a tumult of applause ; people rose in their places and cheered, waving hats and handkerchiefs in their excitement.\""]}, {"page": "Charlotte Helen Sainton Dolby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlotte Sainton-Dolby"]}, {"page": "Sara Hershey-Eddy", "response": ["After a stay of 3.5 years in Berlin, she went to Milan, Italy, where she studied singing with Professor Gerli, and visited the classes of the older Lamperti.
