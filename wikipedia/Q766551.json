While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they soon developed a sparse sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement.

Their debut album Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979.", "In September 1978, Joy Division made their television debut performing \"Shadowplay\" on So It Goes, with an introduction by Wilson. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7\" EP A Factory Sample, the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records. In the NME review of the EP, Paul Morley praised the band as \"the missing link\" between Elvis Presley and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Joy Division joined Factory's roster, after buying themselves out of the RCA deal.Factory Records did not have record contracts, so Joy Division (and later New Order) were never actually signed to the label. Gretton was made a label partner to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, during the drive home from gig at the Hope and Anchor in London, Curtis suffered his first recognised severe epileptic seizure and was hospitalised. Meanwhile, Joy Division's career progressed, and Curtis appeared on the 13 January 1979 cover of NME. That month the band recorded their session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, \"Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realisation that Ian's illness was something we would have to learn to accommodate\".", "Joy Division's debut album, Unknown Pleasures, was recorded at Strawberry Studios, Stockport, in April 1979. Producer Martin Hannett significantly altered their live sound, a fact that greatly displeased the band at the time; however, in 2006, Hook said that in retrospect Hannett had done a good job and \"created the Joy Division sound\". The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who went on to provide artwork for future Joy Division and New Order releases.", "Producer Martin Hannett \"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\". Hannett demanded clean and clear \"sound separation\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was \"crucial\". There are \"devices of distance\" in his production and \"the sound is an illusion of physicality\".", "The band's dark and gloomy sound, which Martin Hannett described in 1979 as \"dancing music with Gothic overtones\", presaged the gothic rock genre. While the term \"gothic\" originally described a \"doomy atmosphere\" in music of the late 1970s, the term was soon applied to specific bands like Bauhaus that followed in the wake of Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Standard musical fixtures of early gothic rock bands included \"high-pitched post-Joy Division basslines usurp[ing] the melodic role\" and \"vocals that were either near operatic and Teutonic or deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Ian Curtis.\""]}, {"page": "May 31", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Martin Hannett, English bass player, guitarist, and record producer (d. 1991)"]}, {"page": "New Order (band)", "response": ["Between 1977 and 1980, Ian Curtis, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, and Bernard Sumner were members of the post-punk band Joy Division, often featuring heavy production input from producer Martin Hannett.Rambali, Paul. \"New Order\".

The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death.
