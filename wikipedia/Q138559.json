He served as Governor-General of India from 1828 to 1835. He has been credited for significant social and educational reforms in India, including abolishing sati, suppressing female infanticide and human sacrifice. Bentinck said that \"the dreadful responsibility hanging over his head in this world and the next, if\u2026 he was to consent to the continuance of this practice (sati) one moment longer.\" Bentinck after consultation with the army and officials passed the Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829 there was little opposition. The only challenge came from the Dharma Sabha which appealed in the Privy Council, however the ban on Sati was upheld. He ended lawlessness by eliminating thuggee \u2013 which had existed for over 450 years \u2013 with the aid of his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman. Along with Thomas Babington Macaulay he introduced English as the language of instruction in India.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
