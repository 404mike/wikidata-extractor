The high point of Niemeyer's tour was his address at the Melbourne Conference of Commonwealth and State leaders, where he said that the 'cold facts must be faced' ... 'In short, Australia is off budget equilibrium, off exchange equilibrium, and faced by considerable unfunded and maturing debts both internally and externally, in addition to which she has on her hands a very large program of loan works for which no financial provision has been made'. He warned Australia had two years 'to get its house in order' before a tranche of external debt matured in 1932. He believed Australians were too optimistic about the country's prospects.Millmow, \"Niemeyer, Scullin and the Australian Economists\", Australian Economic History Review, vol 44 no 2, July 2004 p. 151."]}, {"page": "Gregory (surname)", "response": ["* Theodore Gregory (1890\u20131970), British economist"]}, {"page": "Macmillan Committee", "response": ["The Macmillan Committee, officially known as the Committee on Finance and Industry, was a committee, composed mostly of economists, formed by the British government after the 1929 stock market crash to determine the root causes of the depressed economy of the United Kingdom.
