He quickly established himself as the first choice goalkeeper, however he lost his place by October 1920. He was a member of the sides that won the Staffordshire Senior Cup and shared the North Staffordshire Infirmary Cup in 1920. He proved himself superior to Jonathan Hammond and played 32 Second Division games in the 1919\u201320 season. However, he only featured ten times in the league in the 1920\u201321 campaign, as new signing Walter Smith was preferred. Bourne played 13 matches in the 1921\u201322 season, as he battled with Smith, Teddy Peers and Ernest Blackham for a first team place. Peers won the battle, and Bourne was released from The Old Recreation Ground at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Walter Smith (footballer, born 1884)", "response": ["He joined Second Division Port Vale in October 1920 for a 'modest' fee. However, the morning of his debut game on South Shields on 23 October he was arrested on assault charges against a chambermaid at the hotel where the team had spent the night. After being released on bail he played the game with a detective standing in the crowd, possibly distracting the team as they went on to lose 6\u20131. He was found not guilty at his trial in November 1920 and went on to have a successful career with the club. He featured 29 times in the 1920\u201321 season, ahead of back-up goalkeepers Alfred Bourne and Jonathan Hammond. He played 13 games in the 1921\u201322 campaign, before he seriously injured his leg in a 4\u20131 defeat by Coventry City at Highfield Road on 31 December. Teddy Peers was signed to take his place, and Smith failed to regain his first team place upon his recovery. He was released at the end of the season, but despite being 38 did not retire.
