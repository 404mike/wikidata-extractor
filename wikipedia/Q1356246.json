His reply was that he had always wanted to try being either a poet or an actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) from 1952 to 1954 on a scholarship. This came after being rejected by the Abbey Theatre's drama school in Dublin by the director Ernest Blythe, because he could not speak the Irish language.Is Ireland Dying?: Culture and the Church in Modern Ireland, Michael Sheehy, Taplinger Publishing Company, 1969, page 141 At RADA, he was in the same class as Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Brian Bedford.

The families of Patrick McGilligan and Ernest Blythe, were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household. FitzGerald's mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent, although later in life she converted to Catholicism.

Although the government refused, the following year Minister of Finance Ernest Blythe arranged an annual government subsidy of \u00a3850 for the Abbey. This made the company the first state-supported theatre in the English-speaking world.Kavanagh, pp.\u00a0125\u2013126. The subsidy allowed the theatre to avoid bankruptcy, but the amount was too small to rescue it from financial difficulty.", "The tradition of the Abbey as primarily a writers' theatre survived Yeats' withdrawal from day-to-day involvement. Frank O'Connor sat on the board from 1935 to 1939, served as managing director from 1937, and had two plays staged during this period.  He was alienated from and unable to cope with many of the other board members.  They held O'Connor's past adultery against him.  Although he fought formidably to retain his position, soon after Yeats died the board began machinations to remove O'Connor. In 1941 Ernest Blythe, a politician, who had arranged the first State subsidy for the theatre, became managing director.Pierce, David. \"Irish Writing in the Twentieth Century: A Reader\".

In the D\u00e1il de Valera explained the reason for his dismissal, stating \"[O'Duffy] was likely to be biased in his attitude because of past political affiliations\". The true reason, however, appears to have been the new government's discovery that in 1932, O'Duffy's was one of the voices urging W. T. Cosgrave to resort to a military coup rather than to turn over power to the incoming Fianna F\u00e1il administration.McGarry (2005), p. 189 O'Duffy refused the offer of another position of equivalent rank in the public service.McGarry (2005), p. 197 Ernest Blythe said many years later that the outgoing Government had become so alarmed by O'Duffy's conduct that had they returned to power they would have also acted as De Valera did and dismissed O'Duffy as Garda Commissioner.McGarry (2005), pp. 188,386"]}, {"page": "Maud Gonne", "response": ["Gonne was a leading figure in the Catholic monetary reform movement in Ireland in the 1930s.

Opening, she wrote; \"I read with amazement the report of Mr. Blythe's broadcast attack on Social Credit. Major Douglas's contention that production has outstripped distribution with disastrous results of unemployment and starvation, tending to war and anarchy is incontrovertible, and is apparent to all in the desperate scramble for markets, the restriction of output and destruction in almost every country of consumable goods, while millions of people who need these goods are allowed to starve.\""]}, {"page": "Blueshirts", "response": ["In February 1932, the Fianna F\u00e1il party was elected to lead the Irish Free State government. On 18 March 1932, the new government suspended the Public Safety Act, lifting the ban on a number of organisations including the Irish Republican Army. Some IRA political prisoners were also released around the same time. The IRA and many released prisoners began a \"campaign of unrelenting hostility\" against those associated with the former Cumann na nGaedheal government. Frank Ryan, one of the most prominent socialists in 1930s Ireland, active in the IRA and Republican Congress, declared \"as long as we have fists and boots, there will be no free speech for traitors\". There were many cases of intimidation, attacks on persons, and the breaking-up of Cumann na nGaedheal political meetings in the coming months. In view of the increased activities of the IRA, National Army Commandant Ned Cronin founded the Army Comrades Association in Dublin on August 11, 1932. As its name suggested, it was designed for Irish Army veterans, a society for former members of the Free State army. The ACA felt that freedom of speech was being repressed, and began to provide security at Cumann na nGaedheal events. This led to several serious clashes between the IRA and the ACA. In August 1932, Thomas F. O'Higgins became the leader of the ACA. O'Higgins was joined in the organisation by fellow Cumann na nGaedhael TDs Ernest Blythe, Patrick McGilligan and Desmond Fitzgerald. O'Higgins had been chosen as leader partially because his brother Kevin O'Higgins, who had been Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Justice, had been assassinated by the IRA in 1927.", "The 1934 local elections were a trial of strength for the new Fine Gael and the Fianna F\u00e1il government.  When Fine Gael won only six out of 23 local elections, O\u2019Duffy lost much of his authority and prestige. The Blueshirts had peaked by mid-1934 and rapidly began to disintegrate. The Blueshirts began to flounder on the plight of farmers in the Economic War, as the Blueshirts failed to provide a solution. In response to this, O'Duffy began to ramp up his extremist rhetoric. However, this prompted elements of Fine Gael such as Ernest Blythe, Michael Tierney and Desmond FitzGerald to begin working to remove O'Duffy from power.", "In the aftermath of O'Duffy's departure from Fine Gael, most of the party settled back into \"traditional\" conservatism under the leadership of WT Cosgrove and James Dillon. However, this was not true of all of the membership. Ernest Blythe, the Cumann na nGaedhael minister who had been an enthusiastic member of the Blueshirts and heavily supported its gravitation towards corporatism, continued to support fascist causes in Ireland many years after the Blueshirts' demise. Blythe retired from public life in 1936 after the abolishment of the Senate but he continued to engage in politics. During the 1940s he supported and aided the openly fascist Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe. Blythe advised Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe's leader Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Cuinneag\u00e1in on the drafting of the party's constitution, gave it backing in its journal The Leader, as well as making financial contributions towards the party.
