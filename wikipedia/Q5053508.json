After graduation, Dove supported herself by creating and selling jewellery. In 1996, she gained a scholarship from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee.  She undertook a BA and specialised in sculpture. It was during this course of study that she became involved with an artist-initiated project with Unit 13 and as part of the project Full Eye with Anne-Marie Copetake and Ariki Porteous. It was also here that whilst under the tutelage of one of her lectures, Cathy Wilkes, Dove began to use sound, music and movement in her art. Her final installation show was a 90-second work called Fantasy Freedom (1999) and it is suggested that it was this mixed media combination that led to her being involved in representing Scotland in The Venice Biennale in Zenomap 2003. After completing her BA, she moved to Glasgow, where she continued to create further projects combining music and art in addition to co founding the band Muscles of Joy."]}, {"page": "British pavilion", "response": ["* 2019 \u2014 Cathy Wilkes (Curator: Zo\u00e9 Whitley)Mark Brown (April 9, 2018) Cathy Wilkes to represent Britain at 58th Venice Biennale The Guardian."]}, {"page": "58th Venice Biennale", "response": ["The American and British pavilions were unusually inconspicuous in presenting the minimalist works of Martin Puryear and Cathy Wilkes.
