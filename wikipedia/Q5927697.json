He built a new west wing, which contained a dining room, a drawing room, a library, and a ballroom, the last occupying the whole length of the first floor.  He then rebuilt the south wing, connecting it with the new west wing and the older Tudor east wing. At each end of the south wing was a pavilion with a canted bay on its south front.  The west pavilion contained the southern end of the ballroom, and the east pavilion housed a chapel.  During this time the stable block and other buildings were constructed in the grounds.   The architect responsible for this work is unknown, although it has been suggested that the design was by Charles himself.  A major reconstruction took place in 1928 under the direction of the architect Hubert Worthington.  Much of the west wing was demolished, removing the ballroom but retaining the drawing and dining rooms.  To avoid leaving a gap exposing the courtyard, Worthington filled it with a screen wall containing a corridor linking the west and south wings.  He decorated this with quoins, cornices and sash windows.  The projecting pavilions at the ends of the south front were also demolished. In the 1960s the stable block was converted into mews flats.

At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.Colvin, p. 168  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work.Colvin, p. 173 When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \"general idea\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs."]}, {"page": "List of city and town halls in England", "response": ["|Architects: North & Partners and Sir Hubert Worthington"]}, {"page": "Buildings and architecture of Brighton and Hove", "response": ["Brighton College is the only surviving building in the city by George Gilbert Scott: his Brill's Baths have been demolished.

The Municipal Technical College on Richmond Terrace, north of Grand Parade (now flats) was designed in 1895\u201396 by the Brighton Borough Surveyor Francis May.  Extensions of 1909 and 1935 were in a complementary style with brick and dark terracotta, and the whole complex has been described as \"Free Jacobean\" in style.

From the centre of the symmetrical range rise two identical towers.  Several wings then project forwards from this central block, each with a large gable end.  Simpson also designed the chapel in 1906, a sanatorium in 1908 and a library in 1911.  Hubert Worthington worked on a dining room extension in the 1960s. St Mary's Hall, a private school affiliated to Roedean but closed since 2011, has a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade with prominent gables and mullioned windows.
