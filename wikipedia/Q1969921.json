Born in London into a family of artists, he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools in 1840. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1839 and 1875. Most of these works depicted scenes drawn from literature (including Edmund Spenser and John Milton), religion, and history.Pickersgill's The Burial of Harold was accepted as a decoration for the Houses of Parliament in 1847 for the sum of \u00a3500. He also did some landscapes under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites.\nIn 1856 Pickersgill was photographed at The Photography Institute by Robert Howlett, as part of a series of portraits of artists. The picture was among a group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857. In addition, Pickersgill seems to have experimented with photography himself.Pickersgill was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1847 and a full Royal Academician in June 1857, but retired in 1888. He was keeper of the Royal Academy Schools from 1873 to 1887.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lodowicke Muggleton", "response": ["From the death-mask a contemporary engraving was made by G. V. Casseel. The plate was still in the possession of the Muggletonians when Alexander Gordon visited in 1869 but was too worn to be used. A version of this engraving is reproduced on the dust jacket of The World of the Muggletonians. From the engraving, a small oil painting was made by a Muggletonian, Richard Pickersgill (possibly related to Frederick Richard Pickersgill) in 1813. Several copies existed but it seems all have been lost. Fortunately, one was photographed by Hallett Hyatt in 1913 and appears in George Williamson's book opposite page 18. Even at that time, it was clearly in a decayed state. On a visit to the British Museum, the Frost brothers were delighted to find a painting of Muggleton on display. It had been presented in 1758 and appears to have been dated 1674. Alexander Gordon was familiar with it and calls it the best of the Muggletonian paintings. It was a small oval-styled oil painting featuring head and bust and with the sitter looking to his right. It is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London to which it was transferred in 1879.The gallery attribute the work as being by, or after, William Wood. The National Portrait Gallery has six images of Muggleton in total of which one is cast from the death-mask. At April 2009, none are on public display."]}, {"page": "Robert Howlett", "response": ["Howlett's studio portraits at 'The Photographic Institute' included eminent 'fine artists' such as William Powell Frith, Frederick Richard Pickersgill, John Callcott Horsley, and Thomas Webster which were among a larger group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857."]}, {"page": "December 1900", "response": ["** Frederick Richard Pickersgill, 80, British painter and illustrator (b. 1820)"]}, {"page": "Viola (Twelfth Night)", "response": ["In the mid-19th century Frederick Richard Pickersgill painted a few scenes, including: in Act 1, Scene 4 after the character Viola is shipwrecked, when she cross-dresses as Cesario, enters the service of Duke Orsino as his page and falls in love with him; and in Act 3, Scene 1 when Olivia declares her love for Cesario (1859 painting)."]}, {"page": "Pickersgill", "response": ["*Frederick Richard Pickersgill (1820\u20131900), English painter and illustrator"]}, {"page": "James Dafforne", "response": ["|Frederick Richard Pickersgill"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| Frederick Richard Pickersgill   ||align=\"center\" |  1857  || Keeper 1873\u20131887"]}, {"page": "List of officers of the Royal Academy of Arts", "response": ["|Frederick Richard Pickersgill, RA ||10 Jul 1873 \u2013 3 Aug 1887"]}]}}
