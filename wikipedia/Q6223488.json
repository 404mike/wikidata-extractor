At 23 he emigrated to the United States, to upstate New York.  By 1838 he had moved again, this time to Thorold, Ontario, where he was to spend the remainder of his career.\nBrown's first government project was the construction of the Gull Island Lighthouse in Lake Erie between 1846 and 1848.  Subsequently, he was retained to build seven additional lightstations in Ontario, including one in Burlington, Ontario.Brown is best remembered for building Ontario's Imperial Towers, six nearly identical light stations (tower and keeper's dwelling) made of cut stone, and not brick, metal, wood or concrete that was common in the 1850s. All were on Lake Huron or Georgian Bay. Initially, eleven were planned but only six were built, between 1855 and 1859. (The projects cancelled were to be at White Fish Island, Mississagi Strait, Isle St. Joseph, Clapperton Island and Badgley Island.)The origin of the designation Imperial is not certain, but some historians speculate that because the towers were public construction built under the colonial administration while Canada was a self-governing colony of Britain, the name would assure at least some funding from the British Empire's Board of Trade. According to the Heritage Character Statement from the Government of Canada (for the Chantry Island lighthouse (typical of the six), the design is very strong and somewhat ornate.All were built at a time when commercial shipping traffic was increasing on the Great Lakes between Canada and the U.S. because of new trade agreements and the opening of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal locks in 1855. The settlement of the  Bruce Peninsula was already well underway at the time, also making the lighthouses timely as navigational aids for the boats and ships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Brown", "response": ["John Brown most often refers to:", "*John Brown (abolitionist) (1800\u20131859), American who led an anti-slavery raid in Harpers Ferry, Virginia in 1859", "John Brown or Johnny Brown may also refer to:", "*John Browne (anatomist) (1642\u20131702),  British anatomist and surgeon", "*John Brown (physician, born 1735) (1735\u20131788), Scottish physician", "*John Brown (physician, born 1810) (1810\u20131882), Scottish physician and essayist", "*John Brown (actor) (1904\u20131957), English radio and film actor", "*John Brown (fl. 2007), rapper and contestant on Ego Trip's The (White) Rapper Show", "*John Brown (British Army officer) (died 1762), British Army general", "*John Brown of Pittsfield (1744\u20131780), American Revolutionary War officer", "*John Brown (sailor) (1826\u20131883), American sailor and Civil War Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Brown (Medal of Honor) (1838\u2013?), American sailor and peacetime Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Brown Jr. (Navajo) (1921\u20132009), American Navajo Code Talker during World War II", "*John Brown (British Army soldier) (died 1964), UK spy and POW during World War II", "*John Brown (New South Wales politician) (1821\u20131896), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, 1880\u20131882", "*John Brown (Queensland politician) (1881\u20131949), blacksmith and member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*John Brown (Tasmanian politician) (1886\u20131974), member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, 1948", "*John Brown (Australian politician) (born 1931), elected to the Australian House of Representatives, 1977\u20131990", "*John Brown (Upper Canada politician) (1791\u20131842)", "*John Brown (Richmond Hill politician) (fl. 1870s\u20131880s)", "*John Brown (Canadian politician) (1841\u20131905), member of Parliament", "*John Brown (Ontario MPP) (1849\u20131924), member of Ontario assembly and mayor of Stratford, Ontario", "*John Brown (Rhode Island politician) (1736\u20131803), U.S. representative, co-founder of Brown University", "*John Brown (North Carolina politician) (1738\u20131812), pioneer and statesman", "*John Brown (Kentucky politician) (1757\u20131837), U.S. representative and U.S. senator; member of Continental Congress from Virginia", "*John Brown (Maryland politician) (1760\u20131815), U.S. representative", "*John Brown (Pennsylvania politician) (1772\u20131845), U.S. representative", "*John Brown (Texas politician) (1786\u20131852), speaker of the Texas state House of Representatives", "*John Brown (Cherokee chief) (fl. 1830s)", "*John Brown (Seminole chief) (1842\u20131919), Confederate States Army officer", "*John Brown Jr. (Navajo) (1921\u20132009), member of Navajo Tribal Council", "*John Brown (Wales MP) (died c. 1654)", "*John Brown of Priesthill (1627\u20131685), Scottish Protestant martyr", "*John Brown (essayist) (1715\u20131766), English clergyman", "*John Brown of Haddington (1722\u20131787), Scottish clergyman and Biblical commentator", "*John Brown (Vicar of St Mary's, Leicester) (died 1845), British evangelical preacher", "*John Brown (minister) (1784\u20131858), Scottish clergyman and writer", "*John Brown (Mormon pioneer) (1820\u20131897)", "*John Brown (writer) (1830\u20131922), Doctor of Divinity, pastor of Bunyan's Chapel, and author of many works of theology and church history", "*John Brown (moderator) (1850\u20131919), Scottish minister", "*John E.
