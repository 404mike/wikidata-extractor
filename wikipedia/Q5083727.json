Wright also played many first-class cricket games for the Marylebone Cricket Club. His Test match career was limited to three appearances for England against South Africa in 1895-96. Wright was an opening batsman and wicket-keeper.\nWright was educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge.In total Wright went on four overseas tours, all of which were captained by Lord Hawke. These were to the United States and Canada in 1891 and 1894, to India in 1892-93, and then on the South African tour in which Wright played his Tests.\nHe is also notable for two other occurrences:\n\nIn 1890 he was the first captain to declare an innings closed. In a game against Kent at the Bat and Ball Ground in Gravesend, Wright declared Nottinghamshire's second innings closed on 157 for 5 to set Kent a target of 231 to win. However, the tactic did not come off as the game was drawn with Kent on 98 for 9 and Nottinghamshire requiring one more wicket to win.\nIn 1893 Wright became the fourth[1] batsman to be given out handled the ball after he picked up a ball that had become lodged in his pads and returned it to a fielder.Wright retired from the game after losing his eye in a shooting accident and later became a long-standing member of the Nottinghamshire Cricket Club's committee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Handled the ball", "response": ["An addition was made to the law in 1950 to allow umpires to give a batsman not out if the ball should strike the hand after \"an involuntary action by the striker in the throwing up of a hand to protect his person\". For a time, the act of handing the ball back to the fielding side was listed as not out under Law 33, and instead was considered to be part of a different method of dismissal: obstructing the field, covered in Law 37. The illegal nature of this offence was later returned to Law 33, but reverted to Law 37 in 2013. In 1948 the MCC issued a reminder to batsman, advising them not to handle the ball for any reason at any point during a cricket match, but it is relatively common for batsmen to pick the ball up and return it to the fielding side.Brodribb (1995), p. 231. Charles Wright was the first player to be dismissed for returning the ball to a fielder in first-class cricket; albeit wrongly. Brodribb relates that in an 1893 match, W. G. Grace influenced Wright to return the ball to him, and upon doing so, appealed. The umpire dismissed Wright, despite a clause added to the law nine years previous stating that a batsman would not be ruled out if they were returning the ball at the request of the fielding side.Brodribb (1995), p. 230."]}, {"page": "Declaration and forfeiture", "response": ["The first captain to declare was Charles Wright in 1890.
