He became a barrister in 1840 and a Queen's Counsel in 1860,  practicing mainly in Dublin and specialising in equity.\nIn politics, he started as a Conservative, but quickly turned to the Liberals. He drafted the Irish Church Act 1869 which disestablished the Church of Ireland: the drafting has been called \"a monument to his skill and learning\". He was also largely responsible for the drafting of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870; and during the passage of the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 was noted for his conciliatory approach and willingness to accept Opposition amendments.\nHe became Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Spencer, in 1868. He became a Bencher of the King's Inns in 1870 and was appointed in turn Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1872, Attorney-General for Ireland in 1873, and a member of the Irish Privy Council on 24 February 1874. His promotion was regarded as a proper reward for his services to the Liberals, despite the practical problem that until 1874 he did not have a seat in Parliament and therefore could not speak for the Government in the Commons. In 1874 he was elected a Member of Parliament for County Londonderry. He was appointed Attorney-General by  the Liberal Prime Minister Gladstone in 1880,  before becoming Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1881. As Attorney General he prosecuted Charles Stewart Parnell and other leading members of the Irish National Land League for conspiracy.\nHugh Law died suddenly aged 65 on 10 September 1883, from inflammation of the lungs, at Rathmullan, County Donegal. He was remembered as a judge whose decisions commanded universal respect.\nHe married Helen Maria White,  daughter  of  William  White of Dublin on March the 17th 1863: she died in 1875.  His eldest son  later bought the historic Ardbraccan House, former palace of the Lord Bishop of Meath, from the Church of Ireland. His second  son,  also called Hugh Law, sat initially as a Nationalist MP in the House of Commons and later served in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD from June 1927 until 1932.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ardbraccan House", "response": ["The new bishop's palace became famous for its architecture. Funded by government grants and locally paid tithes, the Church of Ireland bishop held court from the mansion, which was the centre of a large agricultural demesne. However the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, following the previous scrapping of Roman Catholic-paid tithes, fatally weakened the economic survival of the bishop's estate, which was left totally reliant on the small local Church of Ireland community, and in 1885 the bishop sold the estate and house, moving to a more suitable smaller mansion nearby. Ardbraccan House was bought by the eldest son of Hugh Law, a former Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and remained in the ownership of his descendants until sold by Colonel Owen Foster in 1985 to Tara Mines, who used it as a guest residence for visiting businessmen."]}, {"page": "Lord Chancellor of Ireland", "response": ["* Hugh Law (1881\u20131883) (sitting Attorney-General)"]}, {"page": "Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" | Hugh Law"]}, {"page": "First Gladstone ministry", "response": ["| Hugh Law"]}, {"page": "Solicitor-General for Ireland", "response": ["*Hugh Law: 18 November 1872 \u2013 February 1874"]}, {"page": "Attorney-General for Ireland", "response": ["* Hugh Law: 1873  ??", "* Hugh Law: 10 May 1880"]}, {"page": "Second Gladstone ministry", "response": ["| Hugh Law"]}, {"page": "Royal School Dungannon", "response": ["*Hugh Law, (1818-1883), Lord Chancellor of IrelandBall p.373"]}, {"page": "Families in the Oireachtas", "response": ["*Hugh Law (1818\u20131883): Liberal MP Londonderry 1874\u20131881", "**his grandson Hugh Law (1872\u20131943): IPP MP West Donegal 1902\u20131918, CnaG TD Donegal 1927\u20131932"]}, {"page": "Hugh Law (Cumann na nGaedheal politician)", "response": ["A barrister, Law was the second son of Hugh Law, who had been Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1881 to 1883,Irish News (Belfast), 3 April 2012 and  his  wife  Helen White, and was educated in England at Wixenford School.Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence, Fate Has Been Kind (1943), p. 20 He was returned as an Irish Parliamentary Party member of the Westminster parliament for Donegal West at an unopposed by-election in April 1902, and was unopposed at successive general elections until he stood down at the 1918 general election, when the seat was won by Joseph Sweeney of Sinn F\u00e9in."]}, {"page": "Hugh Carleton, 1st Viscount Carleton", "response": ["Carleton was possibly born in Cork city, son of Francis Carleton (1713\u20131791) and Rebecca (d.1791), daughter of Hugh Lawton of Castle Jane and Lake Marsh, Co.
