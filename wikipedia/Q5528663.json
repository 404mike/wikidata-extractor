The name Steeleye Span comes from a character in the traditional song \"Horkstow Grange\" (which they did not actually record until they released an album by that name in 1998). The song gives an account of a fight between John \"Steeleye\" Span and John Bowlin, neither of whom is proven to have been a real person. Martin Carthy gave Hart the idea to name the band after the song character.  When the band discussed names, they decided to choose among the three suggestions \"Middlemarch Wait\", \"Iyubidin's Wait\", and \"Steeleye Span\". Although there were only five members in the band, six ballots appeared and \"Steeleye Span\" won. Only in 1978 did Hart confess that he had voted twice. The liner notes for their first album include thanks to Carthy for the name suggestion.", "With two female singers, the original line-up was unusual for the time, and indeed, never performed live, as the Woodses departed the band shortly after the release of the group's debut album, Hark! The Village Wait (1970). While recording the album, the five members were all living in the same house, an arrangement that produced considerable tensions particularly between Hart and Prior on the one hand and the Woodses on the other. Terry Woods maintains that the members had agreed that if more than one person departed, the remaining members would select a new name, and he was upset that this did not happen when he and Gay Woods left the band. Gay and Terry were replaced by veteran folk musician Martin Carthy and fiddler Peter Knight in a longer-term line-up that toured small concert venues, recorded a number of BBC Radio Sessions, and recorded two albums \u2013 Please to See the King (1971) and Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again (1971).

The Woodses departed the band shortly after the release of their debut album, Hark! The Village Wait (1970) and were replaced by singer/guitarist Martin Carthy and fiddler Peter Knight. The resulting line-up toured small concert venues, and released two highly regarded albums Please to See the King (March 1971) and Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again (December 1971), both featuring traditional folk songs and dance tunes with innovative electric arrangements. The bringing in of manager Jo Lustig who pushed for a more commercial sound was probably what prompted the more traditionally minded Carthy and Hutchings to leave the band, which continued with changes of line-up and achieved considerable mainstream success.Hinton, B. and Wall, G.

The Village Wait is the debut album by the British folk rock band Steeleye Span, first released in 1970. It is the only album to feature the original lineup of the band as they broke up and reformed with an altered membership immediately after its release, without ever having performed live. Therefore, it is one of only two Steeleye Span studio albums to feature two female vocalists (Maddy Prior and Gay Woods), the other being Time (1996). A similar sound was apparent years later when Prior teamed up with June Tabor to form Silly Sisters. Overall, the album's sound is essentially folk music with rock drumming and bass guitar added to some of the songs.

In summer 1970, at a Burton-on-Trent concert, they enlisted drummer Neil Hopwood. Goulding left at the start of 1971 to briefly study Buddhism at Samye Ling monastery and then work on his painting career. Pawle and Booth teamed with Gay Woods and Terry Woods for a six-week European tour, but Dr Strangely Strange began falling apart. The group disbanded in May 1971, after playing a concert with Al Stewart at London's Drury Lane Theatre. Booth and Pawle felt the combination was not working, and there were tensions in the band. The Woods explained: \"We said that if the Strangelies hadn't gotten it together during the time we were on the Continent then we would leave, because six weeks of gigging should pull a band tighter. Unfortunately, instead of getting together, they were getting looser\".'Woods Band, Living Their Tradition' in Sounds, Spotlight Publications, 28 August 1971, p. 12", "* Link to Gay Woods' website, where she mentions her and Terry Woods' brief membership of the band"]}, {"page": "Terry Woods", "response": ["* Gay and Terry Woods history on official Gay Woods website"]}, {"page": "Sails of Silver", "response": ["*Gay Woods  - vocals"]}, {"page": "Time (Steeleye Span album)", "response": ["The impetus for the album was a 25th anniversary reunion tour the year before, during which most of the former members of the band performed together.  Maddy Prior was experiencing voice problems so she spoke to Gay Woods, a founding member who had left the band after the first album, to rejoin.  Woods initially resisted this move, since she had not performed publicly for some time, but Prior eventually prevailed and Woods returned to the band.  The result was only the second Steeleye Span album to feature two female singers, which was used to very good effect on the ironic \"Old Maid in the Garrett\" and to a lesser extent on \"The Prickly Bush\" and \"The Cutty Wren\".  Both, Prior and Woods, provide lead vocals on different songs.  Priors' voice troubles are reflected in her musical choices on this album; she generally sings less powerfully and in a lower range, but still effectively.  Woods also introduced a few Irish elements to the bands' repertoire, including the \"Old Maid in the Garrett/Tam Lin reel\" and her Bodhran.

Gay Woods provides most of the lead vocals, although the other three members of the band all do the lead singing on at least one song each.  Liam Genockey, who had played drums on the band's previous two albums also departed, so most of the songs employ minimal or no percussion, although Woods plays tambourine or bodhran on several songs, and Dave Mattacks, formerly of Fairport Convention, mans a drum kit on three songs.  The overall result is an album that has a very strong folk flavour, with rather less rock elements than on previous albums, and one that has much in common with Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again.  The tunes tend to be simpler and the performances more subdued, and in some ways the album is a return to the sound the band had on its first three albums.  The album also has a strong Irish influence, with songs such as \"The Old Turf Fire\", \"Erin\", \"The Bonny Irish Boy\", and \"The Parting Glass\" all being of Irish origin.  Woods' vocal style is distinctly different from Prior's, being more earthy and often more 'in character'.   Unusually, the album has no instrumental pieces.
