The caves were well known by locals already. Captain Smith went to a nearby village and asked the villagers to come to the site with axes, spears, torches, and drums, to cut down the tangled jungle growth that made entering the cave difficult. He then vandalised the wall by scratching his name and the date over the painting of a bodhisattva. Since he stood on a five-foot high pile of rubble collected over the years, the inscription is well above the eye-level gaze of an adult today. A paper on the caves by William Erskine was read to the Bombay Literary Society in 1822."]}, {"page": "1854 in literature", "response": ["*William Erskine with Claudius James Erskine \u2013 History of India under the two first sovereigns of the house of Taimur, Baber, and HumayunKatherine Prior, \"Erskine, William (1773\u20131852)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) Retrieved 8 November 2017, pay-walled."]}, {"page": "James Mackintosh", "response": ["* Maitland Mackintosh (1792\u20131861), married William Erskine"]}, {"page": "1826 in literature", "response": ["*William Erskine \u2013 Memoirs of Babar (translation of Baburnama)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer", "response": ["Farrer married twice, first in 1854 to Frances Erskine (1825\u20131870), daughter of the historian and orientalist William Erskine (1773\u20131852) and his wife, Maitland Mackintosh, daughter of Sir James Mackintosh by his first wife.

Ellis was a capable administrator and had a good relationship with Indians. He even adopted their customs and way of dressing. Among Ellis contributions to oriental scholarship are his works on South Indian property ownership, Hindu law, a \"fake\" French Veda and his commentary on Thirukkural. In 1814, Ellis wrote an account of the Mirasi land proprietary system of South India with the help of his Sheristadar (chief of staff), the Indian scholar Shankarayya. As his reputation for oriental scholarship grew, he was requested by Alexander Johnston to research the origins of a French work titled Ezour Vedam, which was claimed as a translation of a Sanskrit work and a Veda. Ellis proved that the \"Vedam\" was not a translation but an original work of the Jesuit priest Roberto de Nobili, written in 1621 for converting Hindus to Christianity. His monograph on the Ezour Vedam was published posthumously in the Asiatic Journal in 1822. He delivered a series of lectures on Hindu law at the Madras Literary Society, which were published after his death. Ellis had a high regard for Tamil poet-saint Tiruvalluvar and his Thirukkural.A stone inscription found on the walls of a well at the Periya palayathamman temple at Royapettai indicates Ellis' regard for Thiruvalluvar. It is one of the 27 wells dug on the orders of Ellis in 1818, when Madras suffered a severe drinking water shortage. In the long inscription Ellis praises Thiruvalluvar and uses a couplet from Thirukkural to explain his actions during the drought. When he was in charge of the Madras treasury and mint, he also issued a gold coin bearing Thiruvalluvar's image. The Tamil inscription on his grave makes note of his commentary of Thirukkural.The original inscription in Tamil written in the Asiriyapa meter and first person perspective: (The Kural he quotes is in Italics)  \u0b9a\u0baf\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bca\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f \u0ba4\u0bca\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf \u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bc6\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd"]}, {"page": "St John's, Edinburgh", "response": ["* William Erskine (1773-1852) historian"]}, {"page": "Edward West", "response": ["Edward West married Lucretia ffolkes, daughter of his guardian uncle, on 26 August 1822 at Marylebone Church.
