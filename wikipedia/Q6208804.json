He was also an accomplished cycler and sprinter.\nAble to play at half-back or as a forward, he began his professional career with Burslem Port Vale in February 1907. He transferred to Stoke later in the year, before finding himself at Tottenham Hotspur. Failing to make an impression in London, he returned to Port Vale in 1909, and scored a club record 43 goals in the 1909\u201310 season. This won him a move to Liverpool in August 1910, though after falling from the first team picture he moved on to Bristol City in January 1912. He again returned to Port Vale in May 1913, before he saw action in World War I in 1917. He retired from professional football in 1922, having featured in 209 competitive games for Port Vale.", "link_mentions": {}}}
