He was also an accomplished cycler and sprinter.\nAble to play at half-back or as a forward, he began his professional career with Burslem Port Vale in February 1907. He transferred to Stoke later in the year, before finding himself at Tottenham Hotspur. Failing to make an impression in London, he returned to Port Vale in 1909, and scored a club record 43 goals in the 1909\u201310 season. This won him a move to Liverpool in August 1910, though after falling from the first team picture he moved on to Bristol City in January 1912. He again returned to Port Vale in May 1913, before he saw action in World War I in 1917. He retired from professional football in 1922, having featured in 209 competitive games for Port Vale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1968\u201369 in English football", "response": ["* 5 October 1968 \u2013 Joe Brough, 81."]}, {"page": "Joe Schofield", "response": ["For the 1921\u201322 campaign he signed Jack Hampson from Aston Villa for \u00a31,000; Albert Pearson from Liverpool; half-back Ernest Collinge; centre-half from Nottingham Forest Robert Firth (a future Real Madrid manager); young Scottish midfielder Bob Connelly; and forward Billy Agnew from Falkirk.

Facing another financial crisis, coupled with numerous issues with their Cobridge Ground, Vale transferred to The Old Recreation Ground in 1912, moving from Burslem to Hanley. This allowed the club to regular host over 10,000 spectators. At the end of the 1913\u201314 season, Vale agreed to stand down for re-election to the Football League, so that their stronger rivals Stoke would have a stronger chance of gaining re-election. It was understood that this favour would one day be repaid. In the meantime, former Stoke veteran and former England international Tom Holford was appointed as player-manager. The club ceased activities in 1914\u201315, in order not to hinder the war effort. During the war Frank Cannon was killed and Alf Smith was seriously wounded.
