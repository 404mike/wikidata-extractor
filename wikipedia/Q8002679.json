On 2 October 2007 he made his first league start for 598 days in the 1\u20131 away draw with Bury. He kept his starting role for the next three league and cup games culminating in the 4\u20130 away defeat to MK Dons which saw Lincoln's manager John Schofield sacked and Ryan dropped from the team. He was offered a chance to impress the new manager Peter Jackson when handed a starting role in the game at Wycombe Wanderers on 17 November 2008 but disaster struck when he was sent-off after just 27 minutes for a foul tackle on Will Antwi. Despite this he did agree a six-month contract extension at the beginning of January 2008 but he would start no further games and, with his substitute appearances becoming even more sporadic, it was no surprise when, in March 2008, he agreed to cancel his contract with Lincoln and join up with Hucknall Town. Perhaps inevitably, he marked his Hucknall debut by scoring in the 2\u20131 defeat to Hinckley United on 22 March 2008 but after one further start he dropped down to the substitutes bench. He enjoyed a brief sojourn to Bourne Town, scoring in the 2\u20131 away victory over St Ives Town on 15 April 2008, before returning to Hucknall and his place on the bench. At the end of the season, Hucknall announced that Ryan would not be offered a new contract. Having first expressed an interest in signing Ryan a year previously, it was no surprise when Tommy Taylor signed Ryan for Boston United ahead of the 2008\u20132009 season. Ryan was offered fresh terms for the 2009\u201310 season, but rejected a new contract and left the club, joining Harrogate Town. In January 2010 he joined Belper Town on loan. Released by Harrogate at the end of the season, Ryan trialled with both Northwich Victoria and Chester before agreeing a deal to join the former club on 13 August 2010."]}, {"page": "Mario Marinic\u0103", "response": ["During 2002\u20132003, he became a development coach at the Crystal Palace FC Academy.
