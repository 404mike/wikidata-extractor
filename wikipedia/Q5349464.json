She played as a right-arm off break bowler, and played in five test matches for the England women's cricket team between 1963 and 1966. She played domestic cricket for Surrey. Vigor also played for the England bowls team, and took part in the 1991 World Indoor Bowls Championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England women's cricket team", "response": ["In 1963 England took what was to be their last series win over Australia for 42 years. In the first Test, England made 91 for three in the final innings, but in the second match at the North Marine Road Ground in Scarborough England were 97 behind with nine second-innings wickets in hand by the close of the second day. Wickets fell steadily throughout the third day, and England fell from 79 for four to 91 for nine; however, Eileen Vigor and June Bragger held on for the tenth wicket to draw the game. Three weeks later, the teams met for the third and final decider at The Oval, and captain Mary Duggan, in her last Test, scored her second Test century as England declared on 254 for eight. Australia replied with 205, then took two English wickets on the second day, and were set a target of 202. With Duggan and Anne Sanders doing the brunt of the bowling, England took the first nine wickets for 133, before Australia's No. 10 and 11 built a partnership. However, Edna Barker was brought on as the seventh bowler of the innings, and with her fourteenth ball she had Marjorie Marvell lbw to win the game for England."]}, {"page": "Surrey Women cricket team", "response": ["* Eileen Vigor (1963)"]}, {"page": "1991 World Indoor Bowls Championship", "response": ["|1 || align=\"left\"| Eileen Vigor  || 2 || 2"]}, {"page": "Vigor (name)", "response": ["* Eileen Vigor (born 1935), English retired cricketer and lawn bowler"]}, {"page": "Australian women's cricket team in England in 1963", "response": ["* Eileen Vigor"]}, {"page": "New Zealand women's cricket team in England in 1966", "response": ["* Eileen Vigor"]}]}}
