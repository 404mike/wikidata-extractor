Beckett is a writer with roots in the expressionist tradition of modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including Molloy (1951), En attendant Godot (1953), Happy Days (1961) and Rockaby (1981). The terms minimalist and post-modernist have also been applied to his later works.The Cambridge Companion to Irish Literature, ed. John Wilson Foster. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. The poets Charles Olson (1910\u20131970) and J. H. Prynne (b. 1936) have been described as late modernists.Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books."]}, {"page": "List of modernist women writers", "response": ["* Dorothy Richardson (1873\u20131957), British novelist"]}, {"page": "Aerated Bread Company", "response": ["===The Pilgrimage Vol. II \u2013 The Tunnel (Dorothy Richardson)==="]}]}}
