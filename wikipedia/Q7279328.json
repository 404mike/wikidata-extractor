", "Larry Flick from American magazine Billboard wrote, \"Virtually flawless disco/house number is poised to glide from atop U.K. dance charts onto stateside dancefloors within seconds. Track pumps a heavy beat, which is tied in flowing ribbons of strings and horns. Rachel McFarlane provides a bright flash of diva belting, proving her moxie by holding her own against a busy, effect-filled arrangement. Rhythm/crossover radio tastemakers are advised to open their minds and ears.\" Andy Beevers from Music Week deemed it a \"huge house track from Manchester\". He added, \"The Full On Vocal Mix, with its pounding pianos and hackneyed lyrics, is undeniably old-fashioned and is about as cheesy as a lorryload of Wotsits. But it comes with a guarantee to create absolute mayhem on all but the most elite of dancefloors.\" James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update said that the Loveland cover version of the Darlene Lewis song is \"much more exciting\".
