On 31 December he engaged a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, damaging it. At the time, he was flying the personal aircraft of Wing Commander Petrus Hugo. The following year, the squadron replaced its Spitfire Vbs, and began operating the Spitfire IX. By this time Peart had been commissioned and was now a pilot officer. On 23 April 1943, he damaged a Bf 109 and two days later destroyed another near Medjez-el-Bab. Soon afterwards, the squadron shifted to the island of Malta and began flying operations to Sicily and Italy as the Italian campaign commenced. At this time, some of the Spitfires used by the squadron had to be exchanged with the older model Spitfire Vcs of another squadron."]}]}}
