Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master.

Boehm was instrumental in Gilbert being awarded the commission for the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus while both Lant\u00e9ri and Drury worked in Boehm's studio for a time. Boehm's most famous pupil was the Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, daughter of Queen Victoria.
