His career included work with the Colonial Office, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and as the curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium in Singapore and the aquarium at Edinburgh Zoo. Amongst his written works is Cussons Book of Tropical Fishes, published as result of Manchester industrialist  Alexander Tom Cussons' interest in tropical fish.  Cussons had a keen interest in orchids. The hot-houses in which he grew them proved to be well-suited to tropical fish aquariums.\nAlec Frederick Fraser-Brunner is the designer of Singapore's iconic national symbol, the Merlion. The Merlion was originally designed for the Singapore Tourism Board as their logo in 1964. It went on to be sculpted by Mr Lim Nang Seng and completed in 1972. It now sits at Merlion Park in Marina Bay.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Merlion", "response": ["The symbol was designed by Alec Fraser-Brunner, a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium, for the logo of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in use from 26 March, 1964 to 1997 and has been its trademarked symbol since 20 July 1966. Although the STB changed their logo in 1997, the STB Act continues to protect the Merlion symbol. Approval must be received from STB before it can be used. The Merlion frequently appears on STB-approved souvenirs."]}, {"page": "Corydoras reticulatus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Protomyctophum", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Pangio semicincta", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Antennablennius adenensis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Antennablennius australis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Luciosudis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Lampichthys", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Triphoturus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Alec Frederick Fraser-Brunner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Apolemichthys xanthotis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Alec Fraser-Brunner"]}, {"page": "Spotbanded scat", "response": ["The spotbanded scat was first formally described in 1846 as Scatophagus multifasciatus by the  Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and arctic explorer Sir John Richardson with the type locality given as King George Sound in Western Australia, although this is several hundred kilometres from its known range and is probably an error on the type specimen's label and the type locality should be farther north, and the description was published in the Ichthyology of the voyage of H.M.S. Erebus & Terror. In 1936 the American ichthyologist George S. Myers reclassified Scatophagus multifasciatus in to a new monotypic genus Selenotoca. In 1938, the British ichthyologist Alec Fraser-Brunner described a second species for the genus Selenotoca papuensis from New Guinea but Catalog of Fishes states that this taxon is a synonym of S. multiasciatus, although FishBase lists it as a valid species."]}, {"page": "Diplecogaster bimaculata", "response": ["It was described as Cyclopterus bimaculatus in 1788 by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre and was designated as the type species of the genus Diplecogaster by Alec Fraser-Brunner in 1938. The specific name bimaculata refers to the two dark spots on either side of the adhesive sucker while the generic name is a compound of di meaning \"two\", pleco meaning \"fold\" and gaster meaning belly, a reference to the double-type sucker of this genus."]}, {"page": "Alec Fraser (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Alec Fraser-Brunner, British ichthyologist"]}]}}
