He has won two tournaments on the second tier Challenge Tour, the 2001 NCC Open and the 2005 Open Mahou de Madrid. Since graduating from the Challenge Tour at the end of 2005, he has managed to retain his European Tour card each season by finishing inside the top 120 on the Order of Merit, and through the end of 2009, had a best tournament finish on the tour of second place at the 2009 Austrian Golf Open. Despite that result he lost his card at the end of 2009, and spent 2010 playing on both the European and Challenge Tours. In October 2010 Barham had his right kidney removed after a cancerous tumour was diagnosed; he returned to competitive golf at the Kenya Open in April 2011.In recent seasons Barham has begun an initiative in which he donates \u00a31 for every birdie he makes to Demelza House, a children's hospice in Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tenterden", "response": ["* Benn Barham, professional British golfer."]}, {"page": "Russian Open", "response": ["| 2002 || CHA ||  Iain Pyman (2) || align=center|269 || align=center|\u221219 || 1 stroke ||  Benn Barham Guido van der Valk || align=center|30,000"]}, {"page": "Austrian Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2009 || EUR ||  Rafa Cabrera-Bello || align=center|264 || align=center|\u221220 || 1 stroke ||  Benn Barham"]}, {"page": "Iain Pyman", "response": ["| Benn Barham,  Guido van der Valk"]}, {"page": "Open Mahou de Madrid", "response": ["*2005 \u2013  Benn Barham"]}, {"page": "2007 Open Championship", "response": [":Europe: Fredrik Andersson Hed, Benn Barham, Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy, Peter Baker, Nick Dougherty, Mattias Eliasson, Ross Fisher, Alastair Forsyth, Mark Foster, David Frost, Peter Hanson, Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez, Jos\u00e9-Filipe Lima, Graeme McDowell, Francesco Molinari, Oliver Wilson"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Benn Barham||1976\u2013"]}, {"page": "2002 Open Championship", "response": [":Luffness New \u2013 Peter Baker, Benn Barham, Andrew Coltart, Paul Eales, John Kemp (a), Jarrod Moseley, Magnus Persson Atlevi"]}, {"page": "September 2009 in sports", "response": ["**** Cabrera-Bello ties a European Tour record with a final-round 60 and edges out Benn Barham  by one shot."]}, {"page": "Rafa Cabrera-Bello", "response": ["Cabrera-Bello's second season of European Tour golf proved far more successful. In his first eleven events, he missed only one cut, finishing in the top-10 on four occasions and the top-20 a further five times. After such a promising start to the season he suffered a slump in form, making only 2 of his next 10 cuts. However, he bounced back in dramatic style at the Austrian Golf Open in September. Lying nine shots off the lead after the first two rounds, he recorded a third-round 66 to move up the leaderboard, before firing a record-equalling 11-under-par final round of 60 to claim victory by one shot ahead of Benn Barham, who had led for the entire tournament.
