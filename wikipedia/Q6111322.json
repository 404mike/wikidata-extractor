Picked by W. G. Grace out of Bristol club cricket for the South v North match at Lord's in 1891, Board went straight into the Gloucestershire side afterwards and stayed there for 20 years. In 1895, he set the county record for dismissals in a season, with 75. As a batsman, he scored 214 in 210 minutes against Somerset in 1900, the highest by a Gloucestershire wicketkeeper, and in 1903 he shared in a sixth wicket partnership of 320 with Gilbert Jessop against Sussex at Hove, though his share was just 71, while Jessop scored 286. The stand remains the county record for the sixth wicket.\nBoard toured Australia in 1897-98 under A.E. Stoddart without playing in the Tests, and twice toured South Africa, where he played his only Tests. He went with Lord Hawke in 1898\u201399, and won his first two Test caps; he top-scored in his first Test innings, but then never exceeded the 29 he scored in that match. In 1905\u201306, he played in four Test matches in the tour led by Plum Warner.\nBoard was born in Clifton, Bristol. A gardener by trade before he took to professional cricket, he  became a well-known cricket coach at the end of his career. From 1910, he went each winter to New Zealand, where he coached and played for Hawke's Bay, returning each English summer for a few games for Gloucestershire. After the First World War, he became an umpire in English cricket and combined that with winters in South Africa coaching. It was on the return trip from South Africa to England in 1924 aboard the Kenilworth Castle that he had a heart attack and died. He was buried at sea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Lowry", "response": ["Lowry's father, Thomas Henry Lowry, a graduate of Cambridge University, inherited the Lowry property, Okawa, of 20,000 acres,Francis, p. 25. in the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island.

From 1891, Somerset resumed first-class cricket status, and Newton played in the first County Championship match involving the team, against Middlesex at Lord's. In these early days of Somerset's first-class cricket, the county did not lack capable amateur wicket-keepers, and Newton shared the position with the Rev. Archdale Wickham and then Henry Martyn, with the Test player Leslie Gay intervening for a season in 1894. For the seven seasons from 1897 to 1903, Newton played fairly regularly, and his batting improved in these seasons. In 1899, his batting average was more than 20 for the only time in his career, and he made an unbeaten 64 in a high-scoring match against Surrey at Taunton. In 1900, batting in the unaccustomedly high position of No 5 in the batting order, he made 77, equalling his highest career score, in the match against Gloucestershire at Bristol: this was a good match for wicket-keeper/batsmen, with Wickham, Newton's Somerset colleague, making his highest career score with 28 and Jack Board, the Gloucestershire wicket-keeper, trumping both of them with a score of 214 to give his side an innings victory."]}, {"page": "J.H.

He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1898 and graduated as a second lieutenant into the 4th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers in 1899. He was then transferred to the 3rd Battalion, then in South Africa, with Magniac seeing action during the Second Boer War. He was promoted to lieutenant during the course of the war in May 1900, before being promoted to captain in February 1904. He remained in South Africa following the end of the conflict and later played in a first-class cricket match for the South Africa Army cricket team against Pelham Warner's touring Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side at Pretoria in January 1906. He batted twice in the match, being run out for 1 run in the Army first innings, while in their second innings he was dismissed for 14 runs by Frederick Fane.
