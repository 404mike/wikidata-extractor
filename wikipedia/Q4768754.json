Since the United States military has no \"group captain\" rank, Crittendon was referred to as \"colonel,\" the equivalent American rank, to avoid confusion for the show's US audience. He appears several times throughout the series. His date of rank is earlier than Hogan's, so he outranks Hogan, which leads to disastrous results when he overrules Hogan's orders. His medals include the Distinguished Service Order, Order of the British Empire, Military Cross and Bar, and the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar. Crittendon initially believes that a POW's only duty is to escape, and to be involved in anything else, such as spying or sabotage, is strictly against regulations. When Crittendon is first transferred to Stalag 13, Hogan poses him a hypothetical question, asking what he would do if he were aware the POWs were engaged in spying and sabotage; Crittendon replies that he would report them to the German authorities. Crittendon constantly tries to develop and attempt escapes; however, they ultimately fail due to poor planning. In later appearances, Crittendon is aware of Hogan's operations and participates in schemes, though he is shown to be amateurish, much to Hogan's annoyance.  In the episode \"Lady Chitterly's Lover,\" Fox played both Crittendon and British traitor Sir Charles Chitterly (possibly a parody of William Joyce, commonly known as Lord Haw-Haw), who stops at Stalag 13 with his wife Lady Leslie Chitterly (Anne Rogers) while on their way to visit Adolf Hitler, whom they consider a friend.
