He had a successful amateur career, including wins in the English Amateur and the Lytham Trophy, before turning professional after representing Great Britain and Ireland in the 2005 Walker Cup.\nIn his first season as a professional on the second tier Challenge Tour in 2006, Lockerbie finished inside the top 15 in the rankings to graduate to the European Tour for 2007. He failed to win enough money in his rookie season on the European Tour to retain his playing status for the following year. In 2008 he claimed his first professional victory at the Kazakhstan Open, the Challenge Tour's richest regular season tournament. That win helped him to second place on the Challenge Tour Rankings and a return to the European Tour for 2009. In 2009 he finished 108th in the Race to Dubai to keep his card for the 2010 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saint-Omer Open", "response": ["| 2012 || CHA, EUR ||  Darren Fichardt || align=center|279 || align=center|\u22125 || 3 strokes ||  Gary Lockerbie"]}, {"page": "Darren Fichardt", "response": ["In 2012, Fichardt ended a nine-year title drought on the European Tour when he won the Saint-Omer Open by three strokes from Gary Lockerbie.
