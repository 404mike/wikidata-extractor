Davies was one of the first campaigners in the field of international privacy advocacy, founding the watchdog organisation Privacy International in 1990 and subsequently working in emerging areas of privacy such as electronic visual surveillance, identity systems, border security, encryption policy and biometrics.\nIn July 2008 Davies criticised the Stranton landmark Viacom vs. Google & YouTube ruling, stating the privacy of millions of YouTube users was threatened: 'The chickens have come home to roost for Google. Their arrogance and refusal to listen to friendly advice has resulted in the privacy of tens of millions being placed under threat. Governments and organisations are realising that companies like Google have a warehouse full of data. And while that data is stored it is under threat of being used and putting privacy in danger.'Davies was also listed as current Chief Executive Officer of UK consultancy group 80/20 Thinking Limited, which is defunct as of June 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Big Brother Awards", "response": ["The United States most recently hosted its Big Brother Awards \u2013 also known as the Orwell Awards or simply the Orwells \u2013 on 14 April 2005 in Seattle, Washington.

The first annual US Big Brother Awards were made at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference in Washington, D.C., on 7 April 1999, the 50th anniversary of the publication of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. The awards were made by Simon Davies, managing director of the London-based Privacy International to recognize \"the government and private sector organizations which have done the most to invade personal privacy in the United States.\" The awards were given in five categories: Greatest Corporate Invader, Lifetime Menace, Most Invasive Program, People's Choice, and Worst Public Official."]}, {"page": "EFF Pioneer Award", "response": ["* 1999: Jon Postel (posthumous award), Drazen Pantic, Simon Davies"]}, {"page": "Privacy International", "response": ["Members of the new body, including computer professionals, academics, lawyers, journalists, jurists, and activists, had a common interest in promoting an international understanding of the importance of privacy and data protection. Meetings of the group, which took the name Privacy International (PI), were held throughout that year in North America, Europe, Asia, and the South Pacific, and members agreed to work toward the establishment of new forms of privacy advocacy at the international level. The initiative was convened and personally funded by British privacy activist Simon Davies who served as director of the organization until June 2012.", "In March 2009, following the addition of 25 UK cities to Google's Street View service, Privacy International sent a formal complaint about the service to the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The complaint cited more than 200 reports from members of the public who were identifiable on images hosted by the service. Privacy International director Simon Davies said that the organization had filed the complaint due to the \"clear embarrassment and damage\" Street View had caused on many Britons. He said that Street View fell short of the assurances given to the ICO that had enabled its UK launch and asked for the system to be \"switched off\" while an investigation was completed.Strachan, L.

The LSE Director Sir Howard Davies strongly rebutted this charge. The government's intent was apparently to raise doubts about the accuracy of the report in several areas and in particular, the manner in which projected cost estimates had been calculated (based on figures developed by the independent IT analysis company, Kable), and what it called \"selective and misleading use of evidence regarding biometrics and a failure to include any natural scientists to inform the report despite the significant claims made about biometrics and the accuracy of biometric technologies\". Rather than address the issues raised by the report, several government politicians and their biometric experts instead chose to criticize the accuracy of the report, questioning whether the involvement of leading PI campaigners and well known opponents of identity cards meant that it could be considered unbiased. The episode is notable for the nature of its overtly political attack on an academic report from a leading UK university and its personalization of criticisms of Simon Davies. Even MPs who supported identity cards recognized that the government had entered new territory by undermining independent academic work on issues of legitimate contemporary interest.", "The government's claims of bias were strenuously denied by Simon Davies and resulted in heated debate between Government and Opposition parties both in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

YouTube, Inc.", "response": ["In July 2008, during the pre-trial discovery phase, Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site. The move led to concerns that the viewing habits of individual users could be identified through a combination of their IP addresses and usernames. The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which called the court ruling \"a setback to privacy rights,\" and privacy advocates such as Simon Davies, who stated that the privacy of millions of YouTube users was threatened. Judge Louis Stanton dismissed the privacy concerns as \"speculative\", and ordered YouTube to hand over documents totaling around 12 terabytes of data. Judge Stanton held that because YouTube is not a \"videotape service provider\" as defined in the Video Privacy Protection Act, its users' data was not protected under the act. However, Judge Stanton rejected Viacom's request that YouTube hand over the source code of its search engine, saying that it was a \"trade secret\".
