Sweeting had gained extensive knowledge on various topographies and landscapes, by travelling around the world to places such as Greece, Australia, Czechoslovakia, United States, Canada, South Africa, Belize, and most notably China. She published Karst Landforms (Macmillan 1972), and Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment (Springer 1995) after many years of work there starting in 1977. The latter is the first comprehensive Western account of China's karst, one of the first western published works on the karst found within China, even in a male dominated field.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Women in geology", "response": ["* 1995: Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment by Marjorie Sweeting was published; it was the first comprehensive Western account of China's karst.", "* Marjorie Sweeting - lecturer at Oxford University and wrote the first comprehensive Western account of China's karst"]}, {"page": "Marjorie", "response": ["*Marjorie Sweeting, British geomorphologist specialising in karst phenomena"]}, {"page": "Sweeting", "response": ["*Marjorie Sweeting (1920\u20131994), British geomorphologist"]}, {"page": "Index of women scientists articles", "response": ["*Marjorie Sweeting"]}, {"page": "List of female scientists in the 20th century", "response": ["* Marjorie Sweeting (1920\u20131994), British geomorphologist"]}, {"page": "Jean Grove", "response": ["Born Jean Mary Clark to Mary Johnson Clark, one of the first women chemists at Cambridge University, she grew up with a keen interest in science in a family that enjoyed mountaineering. Both her parents were scientists, and her younger sister Margaret Spufford became a notable historian of 16th- and 17th-century England. Jean Grove had tuberculosis as a child and for a year lived in a summer house in the garden. There she read widely, including books on exploration, geology and astronomy, and was taught by her mother. During the War the family moved to St  Asaph, North Wales. Jean Grove attended Howell's School, Denbigh, where Marjorie Sweeting, later a Professor in the Geography Department at Oxford, was teaching. Marjorie Sweeting was a major influence and Jean decided to read geography at her mother's former College, Newnham."]}, {"page": "Timeline of women in science", "response": ["* 1995: British geomorphologist Marjorie Sweeting published the first comprehensive Western account of China's karst, entitled Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment."]}]}}
