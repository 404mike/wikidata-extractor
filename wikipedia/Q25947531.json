Amongst those giving the demonstration was a very young Stirling Moss. The Half-Litre Car Club for 500\u00a0cc Formula 3 organised that first race on 16 April, with 7,000 spectators coming to witness these cars complete in 10 races. The first victory went to a man who was to become a legend in Formula 3, Don Parker. Before the year was out, five meetings had been held, with the events running to a similar programme. The June meeting was a Moss benefit for he won all five races he entered in the Works Cooper and a set a new lap record.

The main event of the day was the 33-lap 49.6-mile Formula Two race which was won by Tony Rolt driving Rob Walker's Connaught A Type.
