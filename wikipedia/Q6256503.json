He then managed to keep Norwich in the top flight, despite the financial constraints he was under, until resigning to manage Manchester City in October 1980, taking his assistants John Benson and John Sainty with him."]}, {"page": "Andy Kilner", "response": ["In 1988, he joined Altrincham in a player swap deal where he spent the remainder of the 1987\u201388 season. He returned to Sweden soon after, joining V\u00e4nersborgs IF before scoring 20 times in the 1990 season for Jonsereds IF despite suffering a broken leg for the second time in his career in 1989. When the Swedish league season ended, Kilner returned to England as part of his contract allowed him to play for other teams on a non-contract basis during the offseason due to only being paid half salary when the season ended. He was offered a trial with Stockport County by assistant manager John Sainty who had coached him as a youngster at Burnley. He played two matches for Stockport's reserve side, scoring once against Rochdale and twice against Crewe Alexandra. His performances saw him handed his first team debut on 1 January 1991 as a substitute in place of Paul Williams during a 1\u20131 draw with Gillingham. Three days later, he was named in the starting line-up for a league match against Wrexham and scored both goals in a 2\u20130 victory, signing a permanent contract with the club soon after. He quickly established himself in the first team and scored eleven league goals to help the club win promotion from the Fourth Division. However, manager Danny Bergara later made several tactical changes to the club's style of play that ultimately led to Kilner falling out of favour and, after brief loan spells with Rochdale and Bury, he left the club."]}, {"page": "Peter Bulmer", "response": ["Bulmer was the product of the youth setup with Chester City. He joined the club aged 15Player Memories, Chester City v. Brentford matchday programme; 27 December 1994; p.15 and made his first-team debut as a substitute against York City on 18 December 1982. He went on to make nine league starts during the season under John Sainty, wearing the number 11 shirt. The 1983\u201384 season produced one more start, but in 1984\u201385 he was a regular in the side. This season saw him divide playing at left back and on the left wing, scoring once in his 38 league appearances.
