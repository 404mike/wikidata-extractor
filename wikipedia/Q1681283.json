He was born in Edinburgh, and was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. He is remembered primarily for his books The Harmonious Circle, The Occult Underground (originally titled Flight from Reason), and The Occult Establishment.\nIn 1980 his important biography of G. I. Gurdjieff, titled The Harmonious Circle, was published. He spent 8 years researching the book, making contacts with the Gurdjieff community worldwide. The New York Review of Books described Webb's research and knowledge of the subject as \"extremely comprehensive\", and Mistlberger described the book as \"scholarly and occasionally gossipy\" with Webb being \"unquestionably a sincere researcher\" who became \"deeply involved in the matter of his subject\" while remaining \"fundamentally an outsider, an investigative journalist\". Tamdgidi wrote that, amongst all the biographers of Gurdjieff, \"only Webb claimed to have been independent and outside the circle of Gurdjieff's followers\", and in 2004, in Inventors of Gurdjieff, Paul Beekman Taylor described The Harmonious Circle as \"the first systematic biographical account by a writer who hadn't known Gurdjieff personally\" Webb established that Gurdjieff's writings revealed substantial evidence of familiarity with the languages and cultures of central Asia, but Webb regarded Gurdjieff more as a self-taught innovator than a member of an esoteric Asiatic group, and, although seeing some of its forms having derived from Asia, saw the content of his teachings deriving from western occult traditions.Webb's theories of Gurdjieff's identity as a Russian foreign agent in Central Asia, and theories on where he actually travelled before 1917, are considered controversial points in The Harmonious Circle.\nWebb's work challenges theories of secularism, theories of decline in organised religion and spirituality. Webb argued that the 19th and 20th centuries had also been marked by a revolt against the Enlightenment, and that the rise of irrationalism was much more marked than the rise of rationalism, especially before, during and after the First World War and the Second World War. Webb traced the influence of occult and mystical groups and writers on literature, philosophy and politics.\nWebb was generally ignored in his lifetime, but with the increasing rise of New Age spirituality in later years, his work now seems increasingly prescient. After increasing mental health difficulties, Webb committed suicide in 1980.\nNicholas Goodrick-Clarke has lauded him as a serious researcher of occultism: \"By focusing on functional significance of occultism in political irrationalism, Webb rescued the study of Nazi occultism for the history of ideas.\"His major works The Occult Underground and The Occult Establishment were translated into German and published in 2009 and 2008 respectively.\nTrinity College established the \"James Webb Prize for the History of Ideas\" in his memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Root race", "response": ["According to historian James Webb, the occult concept of succeeding prehistoric races, as later adopted by Blavatsky, was first introduced by the French author Antoine Fabre d'Olivet in his Histoire philosophique du genre humain (1824).James Webb, The Occult Underground, Open Court, La Salle 1974, p. 270 By contrast, historian Goffe Jensma claims that the concept of root races was first articulated in the Dutch esotericist book Oera Linda, which was translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876.Jensma, Goffe (November 2007), \"How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

Landau was discomposed by having unwanted cigarettes pressed upon him, and Gurdjieff did not intend to answer his questions. Even worse, the journalist appeared to be falling under some 'hypnotic influence' \u2026\"Webb (1987), p. 421, The Harmonious Circle: The Lives and Works of G. I. Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, and Their Followers  (Boston: Shambhala). According to Whitall Perry, \"Explaining that he himself is not at all telepathic, given to mediumship, or subject to hypnotism, Landau says \u2026 In a few seconds he felt his body from the waist down penetrated with a growing weakness enough to render him incapable of leaving his chair had he tried. Only by mustering all his concentration in talk with the young attendant did he finally manage to extricate himself \u2026 Upon departing he was presented by Gurdjieff with a copy of his Herald of Coming Good; it was bound in imitation su\u00e8de, but of a grain so abrasive it made the teeth grind at the very touch. Landau realized that this was all part of an effect deliberately calculated by the author\u2014whose book reads, moreover, as though conceived in clouds of Armagnac (the opening sentence alone, by Landau's count, contains not less than two hundred and eighty-four words).\"Perry (1975), \"Gurdjieff in the Light of Tradition Part III: The Phenomenon\u201d (Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 9, No. 2., Spring, p. 2).

Before meeting Gurdjieff, Landau recounts, \u201cOne of his pupils said to me one day: \u2018I imagine that Rasputin must have been like Gurdjieff: mysterious, domineering, attractive and frightening at the same time; full of overabundant vitality and of strange knowledge, inaccessible to other men.\u2019 His hypnotic powers were never disputed, yet all his external methods constituted but an insignificant part of his far wider knowledge.\u201dLandau (1935), p. 240, God is My Adventure: A Book on Modern Mystics, Masters and Teachers (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, Ltd.)."]}]}}
