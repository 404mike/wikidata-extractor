The later groups came from what became known as the \"Madchester\" scene that also centred on The Ha\u00e7ienda nightclub developed by the founder of Factory Records, Tony Wilson. Although from southern England, The Chemical Brothers subsequently formed in Manchester. Former Smiths frontman Morrissey, whose lyrics often refer to Manchester locations and culture, later found international success as a solo artist.

Therefore, he chose to study creative writing as he enjoyed writing poetry and short stories, but not reading. While at the University of Salford (studying creative writing), Fray started performing acoustic sets as a singer-songwriter around bars and at open-mic nights in Manchester. After getting positive reactions from the crowd, Fray decided to leave university and form a band. He recruited long-time friend and neighbour Michael Campbell, who had never played the drums before.

He told the NME: \"I used to go to Salford University and I would see from the bus in the morning Japanese and American tourists outside having their picture taken. We were joking about opening the doors at two in the afternoon so everyone at the gig can get their photo on the way in! It's a massive landmark and it's a pleasure and privilege to play it.\" The show was hosted by XFM Manchester Breakfast Show presenter Tim Cocker and broadcast on the same station.
