With Sleepy Hollow, Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company Hammer Films. Christopher Lee, one of Hammer's stars, was given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles (Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken, among others), and Christina Ricci was cast as Katrina van Tassel. A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's gothic score, the film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, Sleepy Hollow was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from actress Lisa Marie), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing Planet of the Apes which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was \"not a remake\" of the earlier film."]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["* July 31 - Richard Griffiths, English actor (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "Manchester Metropolitan University", "response": ["* Richard Griffiths \u2013 actor"]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["The series which centres on the character of Geraldine Granger, the new vicar of the village of Dibley,  almost immediately exploited the 1992 changes in the Church of England that permitted the ordination of women.
