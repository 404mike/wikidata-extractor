While in prison, and observing the use of a broom to sweep the floor, he decided that the prevalent method used to clean teeth at the time \u2013 crushed shell or soot \u2013  with a cloth was ineffective and could be improved. To that end, he saved a small animal bone left over from the meal he had eaten the previous night, into which he drilled small holes. He then obtained some bristles from one of his guards, which he tied in tufts that he then passed through the holes in the bone, and which he finally sealed with glue.\nAfter his release, he started a business to manufacture the toothbrushes he had built, and he soon became very rich. He died in 1808, and left the business to his eldest son, also called William, and it stayed in family ownership until 1996. Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK.By 1840 toothbrushes were being mass-produced in England, France, Germany, and Japan.", "link_mentions": {}}}
