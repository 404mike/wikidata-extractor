However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that \"these are strange times for everyone, and for us in the music industry there has been a lot of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time.\" After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to \"do other things\". A MySpace entry stated: \"It's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next\". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 \u2013 it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year \u2013 and play \"a gig or two\" as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock \u2013 The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had \"knocked us out of our stride\" and had led to him considering his future."]}, {"page": "Jonnie craig", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonnie Craig "]}, {"page": "Jonnie", "response": ["* Jonnie Craig (born 1988), English photographer"]}]}}
