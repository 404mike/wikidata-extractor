He is a midfielder.\nWolleaston started his career with Chelsea, but he only made two first-team appearances in five years, and instead had short loan spells with Bristol Rovers, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth and Northampton Town. Following his release from Chelsea, he moved to Bradford City, but was released after one season, in which the club suffered relegation and administration. He spent more than a season with Oxford United but left following a series of injuries and instead dropped into non-league with Cambridge United, for whom he played 92 league games in three seasons, until he moved to Rushden & Diamonds in 2008. He played another 57 games at Rushden, and went on to have a short spell with Farnborough before moving to Weymouth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lee McEvilly", "response": ["Accrington Stanley re-signed McEvilly on a one-year contract following his departure from Wrexham. On his return to Accrington he commented; \"I am back here because I feel I have unfinished business. I played well for a year here and I want to do the same again\". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2\u20130 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1\u20130 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot from the edge of the penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2\u20130 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007\u201308 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2\u20132 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2\u20130 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1\u20130 at Wembley Stadium."]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.
