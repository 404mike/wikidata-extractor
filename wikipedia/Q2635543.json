For a time he worked in the gardens at Welbeck Abbey. He entered Kew in 1879 and became second assistant.  \nHe was the first curator of the orchid herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded the magazine The Orchid Review, and published many papers on hybrids of different species of orchids.\nThe genus Allenrolfea of amaranths was named after him by Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze.\nRolfe was buried in Richmond Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Horticultural Society", "response": ["* Robert Allen Rolfe, the founder of the magazine The Orchid Review"]}, {"page": "Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach", "response": ["thumb|leftHis immense herbarium and library were bequeathed to the 'Naturhistorisches Museum' in Vienna, Austria (instead, as expected, to the Kew Gardens), on the condition that it would not be consulted during the first 25 years after his death. Reichenbach probably acted this way out of resentment of the appointment of Robert Allen Rolfe, a self-taught orchid expert, as the top taxonomist at Kew.  This resulted in a great number of double or multiple descriptions of orchid species, which had to be corrected afterwards."]}, {"page": "Leptotes (plant)", "response": ["Robert Allen Rolfe received from Brazil, also without information of locality, a plant similar to the Leptotes tenuis species described by Reichenbach over 20 years earlier. Rolfe described it as L. minuta and noted it had much thicker and shorter leaves.Rolfe, Robert Allen: Leptotes minuta in Gardeners' Chronicle  Vol.1889-2:  p. 323. London, 1889. This new species was included in C\u00e9lestin Alfred Cogniaux's revision of Brazilian orchid species, published 1903, but in doing so he was unaware of the variability within the Leptotes species. At the time Cogniaux published his book he had not had the opportunity to check the types of all the other species then described, therefore, he accepted most of them with this remark.Cogniaux, C\u00e9lestin Alfred: Leptotes in Flora Brasiliensis Vol.3 Part.6:  pp. 254-259. K.F.P. von Martius Ed., 1903. Published on Internet, in Latin. In retrospect, it is now more clear that the variation in leaves was due to both the isolation of various populations and because of the different growth conditions in each habitat, and today L. minuta is known as a variation of L. tenuis."]}, {"page": "List of authors of South African botanical taxa", "response": ["*Robert Allen Rolfe (1855\u20131921) S ........

In 1919, Friedrich Rudolf Schlechter transferred the species to Neottianthe (having slightly earlier placed it in Gymnadenia). A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of Neottianthe, Amitostigma and Ponerorchis were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Neottianthe and Amitostigma were subsumed into Ponerorchis, with this species becoming Ponerorchis camptoceras."]}, {"page": "Myrmecophila", "response": ["Species in this genus are either epiphytic or lithophytic in their growth habit. Their slightly scented flowers are produced on pole-like growths that extend upwards from 1 to 4 meters high and take up to 4 months to develop. Several of the Schomburgkia species were transferred into the genus Myrmecophila by Robert Allen Rolfe in 1917."]}, {"page": "Allenrolfea occidentalis", "response": ["The knobby green stems are fleshy and appear jointed at the internodes between segments.  Often the segments are so short they are nearly round. The leaves appear as flaky scales scattered across the surface of the stems.
