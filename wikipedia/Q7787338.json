In this role he designed Guildhall, Argyle Street, Laura Place, Great Pulteney Street and many others. In 1793, he was dismissed for financial irregularities, and as a result he was forced into bankruptcy and his reputation was ruined. Jane Root, biographer of Baldwin, writes; \"he had a history not merely of imprudence, but of deliberate dishonesty\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
