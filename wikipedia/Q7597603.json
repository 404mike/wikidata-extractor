A team largely made up of reserve and youth team players beat Sheffield Wednesday 3\u20130 in the first match after the disaster. The programme for that match showed simply a blank space where each United player's name should have been. With seven players dead (Duncan Edwards died just over 24 hours later), and with only Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes fit to play out of the surviving players, United were desperate to find replacements with experience, so Murphy signed Ernie Taylor from BlackpoolMorrin, p. 147. and Stan Crowther from Aston Villa.Morrin, p. 150. Three players, Derek Lewin, Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley, were transferred to United on short-term contracts by non-League club Bishop Auckland. Bradley was the only one of the three players to play for the first team, and the only one to sign a permanent contract. The remaining places in the team were filled by reserve players including Shay Brennan and Mark Pearson.Marking club's 125-year history The Advertiser, 12 March 2012.

Stan Crowther and Ernie Taylor would normally have been cup-tied and thus ineligible to play for Manchester United.

In that air crash, eight United players died and two others were so seriously injured that they never played again, while five others had still not fully recovered from their injuries when the match was played.
