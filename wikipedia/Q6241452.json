She remained an active Fabian, and after the Fabian Research Department became the Labour Research Department in 1917, served on the new body's executive committee.Vernon, pp. 59\u201360. Through these connections she became a member of the National Guilds League (NGL), an organisation that promoted industrial democracy, workers' control and producer associations in a national system of guilds.Perry, pp. 21\u201323. She maintained her connection with the WIL, whose 1919 conference adopted a non-pacifist stance that justified armed struggle as a means of defeating capitalism.Bartley, pp. 19\u201320. After visiting Ireland for the WIL in 1920 she became an outspoken critic of the British government's actions there, in particular its use of the \"Black and Tans\"  as a paramilitary force. She gave evidence about the conduct of British forces in Ireland at the Congressional Committee of Investigation in Washington in December of that year.Perry, pp. 157\u2013159. She called for an immediate truce and the release of republican prisoners.Vernon, p. 43.Leeson, pp. 88 and 179.", "Wilkinson never married, although she enjoyed numerous close friendships with men. Apart from her early engagement to Walton Newbold, she was close to John Jagger for many years,Vernon, pp. 124\u201325. and in the early 1930s enjoyed a brief romantic attachment with Frank Horrabin. Her long association with Morrison began in her early Fabian days; Morrison was very reticent about this friendship, choosing not to mention Wilkinson in his 1960 autobiography despite their close political association. Vernon says that the relationship almost certainly became \"more than platonic\", but as Wilkinson's private papers were destroyed after her death, and Morrison maintained silence over the matter, the full nature and extent of their friendship remains uncertain.Vernon, pp. 126\u201329. Labour MP Rachel Reeves has noted differing opinions among their respective biographers, but cites a recollection by wartime Minister P. J. Grigg as suggesting a friendship that was more than platonic.Rachel Reeves (2020) Women of Westminster  "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Jagger"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|John Jagger"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom by-election records", "response": ["*1942 Manchester Clayton by-election: John Jagger was killed in a motorcycle accident."]}, {"page": "Manchester Clayton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Jagger"]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|||John Jagger||1872||1942 (motorcycle accident)||Labour||Manchester Clayton (1935\u2013death)||"]}, {"page": "National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers", "response": [":1921: John Jagger"]}, {"page": "Harry Thorneycroft", "response": ["Thorneycroft unsuccessfully contested the borough of Blackpool at the 1935 general election, and was elected to Parliament seven years later at a Manchester Clayton by-election in October 1942 after the death of the Labour MP John Jagger.Craig, page 186 During the Second World War, the parties in the coalition government did not contest by-elections when vacancies occurred in seats held by their coalition partners, but in the Clayton by-election Thorneycroft was opposed by an independent candidate, Major Hammond Foot.
