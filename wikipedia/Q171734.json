He was born in Cairo, Egypt, the son of Colonel Leslie Brindley Bream Beuttler, Duke of Wellington's Regiment, O.B.E., and a descendant on his mother's side of the Scottish ornithologist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant, grandson of the 6th Earl of Seafield.He was a talented Formula Three driver from the late 1960s, who then graduated to Formula Two and then to Formula One in 1971.\nThe finance for the team came from a group of stockbroker friends from whom the team took its name \u2013 at first Clarke-Mordaunt-Guthrie Racing, and in 1973 it became Clarke-Mordaunt-Guthrie-Durlacher Racing. This approach of funding the team earned his car the nickname of the \"Stockbroker Special\".He raced on one occasion, at the 1971 Canadian Grand Prix, for the works March team. Beuttler's best result was a seventh place in the 1973 Spanish Grand Prix.\nWhile Beuttler did not achieve a points-scoring finish during his career in Formula One, he did achieve five top-ten finishes in the 28 races in which he competed, results that would have delivered points by today's championship regulations.\nWhen his backers suffered amid the 1973 oil crisis, Beuttler retired from racing the following year, at the age of 34, after competing in the 1000 km of Brands Hatch.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 13", "response": ["*1940 \u2013 Mike Beuttler, Egyptian-English racing driver (d. 1988)"]}, {"page": "December 29", "response": ["*1988 \u2013 Mike Beuttler, Egyptian race car driver (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "Cosworth DFV", "response": ["|rowspan=2 align=\"left\"|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1971 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1971 German Grand Prix", "response": ["The race returned to the N\u00fcrburgring after a year at the Hockenheimring after the safety was improved on the track.

Ronnie Peterson led away but a very quick start by Jackie Stewart brought him from fourth to second but passed Peterson to take the lead at Beckets. Carlos Reutemann was in third with Denny Hulme and Jody Scheckter behind him. As the exited Woodcote corner to complete the first lap, Stewart led Peterson and Reutemann but carnage was happening behind them. Scheckter tried to pass Hulme on the outside Scheckter's car went wide and spun right across the track and it hit the retaining wall of the pits and bounced back into the middle of the track. Hulme escaped undamaged, Francois Cevert, James Hunt, Peter Revson and Clay Regazzoni also went by. The big one then happened as Scheckter's car ricocheted back from the pit wall, Revson struck Scheckter's rear wing and then all hell broke loose as the rest of the field crashed into the wrecks or dodged about to miss the wreckage. Nine cars were involved in the resulting carnage, Andrea de Adamich had crashed headlong into the barriers on the outside of the track and he was trapped in the cockpit of his Brabham with a broken ankle. Apart from minor bruises and shakings no-one else was hurt but the Surtees cars of Mike Hailwood, Carlos Pace and Jochen Mass were smashed up. The Shadow's were also involved, Jackie Oliver's car was wrecked, George Follmer's car was ripped open. The Embassy Hill-entered Shadow of Graham Hill was struck in the rear and a wishbone broken, but Hill drove it round back to the pits under its own power. The BRM of Jean-Pierre Beltoise and the works March of Roger Williamson were wrecked, as was the McLaren of Scheckter. The race organisation acted instantly and the race was red flagged indicating without argument or discussion that the race was stopped and would be started again later. Meanwhile, those ahead of the accident were still racing, until they ended the lap, when they all came to a rapid stop at the scene of the crash. It took 30 minutes to release de Adamich from the wreckage of the Brabham plus an hour to clear away the wrecked cars and the debris. The cars that escaped were wheeled back to the starting grid and Hill's Shadow was repaired in the pits, and Niki Lauda's BRM that had been in the pits all the time had a new drive-shaft fitted. Hunt's March needed a new airbox as his original one was damaged in the wreck and borrowed Mike Beuttler's airbox from his car.", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1973 Dutch Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1973 German Grand Prix", "response": ["|Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1973 Austrian Grand Prix", "response": ["|Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1973 Italian Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1973 Canadian Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1973 United States Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1973 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|align=\"left\"|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1972 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|align=\"left\"|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "1971 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Mike Beuttler", "|  Mike Beuttler", "|align=\"left\"|  Mike Beuttler"]}, {"page": "March Engineering", "response": ["The 1972 Formula One season completely failed to capitalise on the promise March showed in 1970-71. Three distinct models of the car were used, beginning with the 721, which was a development of the 711.  Peterson and Niki Lauda then drove the disappointing experimental 721X factory cars (using an Alfa Romeo transverse gearbox and intended to have a low polar-moment, anticipating in some ways the much more successful Tyrrell 005/006 series). Frank Williams ran regular 711 and 721 customer cars for Henri Pescarolo and Carlos Pace. The 721X was deemed to be a disaster and abandoned, but the team saw a way out; customer Mike Beuttler and his backers ordered an F1 car, and the team produced the 721G in nine days (the G stood for Guinness Book Of Records as the car was built so quickly) by fitting a Cosworth DFV and larger fuel tanks to the 722 F2 chassis (not as desperate an experiment as it may have sounded -- John Cannon commissioned a Formula 5000 car which was built to a very similar scheme). The 721G was light and quick, and the works team soon built their own chassis. The 721G set the trend for future March F1 cars, which for the rest of the 1970s were essentially scaled-up F2 chassis.
