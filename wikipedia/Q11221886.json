He was born in Sussex in 1911 and played 322 first-class matches, largely for Sussex County Cricket Club, between 1931 and 1952.  A right arm fast medium bowler, he took 1019 wickets at 26.49 with a best of 9 for 53.  He was very much a tail end batsman, averaging 5.34 with a best of just 34.  He died in Zimbabwe in 1985.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sussex County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Jim Cornford || 1,019"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Playfair emphasised the contrast between strong batting and weak bowling at Sussex who recovered from bottom place in 1946 to finish a creditable equal ninth. Only Jim Cornford performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: John Langridge, George Cox and Harry Parks. James Langridge reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to appendicitis. Charles Oakes and new captain Hugh Bartlett were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary Billy Griffith had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour. Other players who appeared were Paul Carey, Donald Smith, Jim Wood, Jack Oakes, John Nye and two future Test players Alan Oakman and David Sheppard.Playfair, pp. 99\u2013100."]}, {"page": "Jake Seamer", "response": ["A personable man, Seamer was a popular captain of Somerset. He had some quirks to his personality, and Roebuck goes as far as describing him as an eccentric. During his childhood he would often cycle from his home in Shapwick to Taunton, a distance of over 15 miles, to watch Somerset play cricket. When he began playing for the county, prior to starting at Oxford University, a number of his childhood heroes were still in the side. In one match, Seamer had been dismissed, and passed one of these heroes, Jack White coming to the wicket. White asked what kind of bowler Jim Cornford was, as he had not seen him play before. Seamer, unsure, bluffed and stated that he bowled outswingers. Shortly afterwards, White returned to the dressing room, irate, and declared \"the fellow bowls bloody inswingers.\" Bespectacled, Seamer dressed smartly and was proud of his Somerset heritage, often putting on a broad accent when he was in London."]}, {"page": "James Cornford", "response": ["#REDIRECTJim Cornford"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Having been a mid-table team through most of the 1920s, Sussex showed a marked improvement in 1928 to finish a good sixth and then a strong fifth in 1929. They slipped a little in 1930 but then came good and were fourth, second, second and second from 1931 to 1934. They were very close to their first official title in both the latter two seasons when one more win might have swung the balance. Sussex fell away in 1935 and were in mid-table from then to 1939. Noted batsmen were Ted Bowley, Tom Cook, Duleepsinhji, and the two pairs of brothers James and John Langridge, Harry and Jim Parks Sr. Sussex had the future South African Test captain Alan Melville in their team during the mid-1930s. Sussex had one of the all-time great bowlers in Maurice Tate. Vallance Jupp played for them in the early 1920s and other good or useful bowlers were Bowley, Jim Cornford, George Cox Jr, James Langridge, Jim Parks and Albert Wensley. Sussex keeper George Street was killed in a road accident at the beginning of the 1924 season and Tich Cornford succeeded him."]}]}}
