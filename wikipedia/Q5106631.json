Their strained familial relationship was apparent from his very first scene, in which conflict arose over his reluctance to eat a meal with brown sauce. Roache called it \"good character-defining stuff\", which established the antagonism between Ken and his father, borne from Ken's snobbery and desire to abandon his roots.Roache 2010, p.53. The death of his mother further illuminated the father-son relationship. Roache recalls that, \"although their relationship could often be stormy, with Ken's views and attitude rubbing Frank up the wrong way on a number of issues, the fact was that they had been thrown together by her death and they had to get used to living with each other without the buffer that Ida had often provided.\"Roache 2010, pp.65\u201366. While Dyson left the series under her own volition, Pemberton later became one of several cast members fired under Aspinall's tenure as producer. By 1984, both of Ken's parents had left the Street.Roache 2010, pp.75\u201378. Ken was originally intended to have a sister named Enid. Warren decided against her inclusion, and instead created a younger brother, professional footballer David (Rothwell), to enable the show to represent teenage males.Egan 2010, pp.15\u201316. Rothwell feels that an \"underlying antagonism\" existed between Ken and David, which stemmed from the fact Ken had the advantage of a university education, while his brother did not.Egan 2010, p.25.", "Ken was bored with looking after the children, Peter and Susan, before Valerie's death. Afterwards, further problems occurred and Ken was no longer able to cope. The writers were initially uncertain whether to continue with Ken as a single father, or dispatch the children and pursue a less-encumbered lifestyle.Roache 2010, p.107 Roache said, \"Ken tried to bring up the kids on his own, but he wasn't doing so good. So he sent them up to Glasgow to live with his mother-in-law.\" Ken still remained in contact; Roache recalled Ken often saying: \"Right, I'm off to Scotland.'\" Roache has suggested that the subsequent problems in his children's adulthood were Ken's fault: \"I blame Ken for how they've all turned out. He shoved his kids up in Scotland, didn't really look after them. But you don't want a happy family in the Street. You want a wonderful dysfunctional one like the one I've got, they're great and Deirdre is wonderful.\" The animosity between Ken and his children has been explored throughout the programme's duration. Chris Gascoyne, who took on the role of Peter in the 2000s, has suggested that there is a lot of tension between Ken and Peter due to the dysfunctional nature of the Barlow family. Guilt over the twins' upbringing led Ken to dote on his youngest son, Daniel, as he was keen to avoid repeating his past mistakes. Their close relationship resulted in Roache challenging the series producers when a script required Ken to allow Daniel to be taken away by his mother. The actor felt that Ken would not accept this; he would fight. The scriptwriters apologised, but it was too late to re-write the plot.Roache 2010, pp.189\u2013190.", "In March 2017, Ken was at the centre of a \"whodunit\" storyline which saw an unknown assailant push him down the stairs of his house after striking him over the head with a blunt object.
