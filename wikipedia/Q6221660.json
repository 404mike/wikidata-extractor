In 1903 Marius F\u00e9rotin claimed the author is one Aetheria or Egeria, known from a letter written by the 7th century Galician monk Valerio of Bierzo. He dated her pilgrimage to about 381\u2013384, during the reign of Theodosius I. F\u00e9rotin believed she was from Gallaecia, but in 1909 Karl Meister disputed F\u00e9rotin's theory about the date of Egeria's pilgrimage and her identity. Meister argues that her language shows no evidence of Spanish dialect, but rather, suggests that she may have been from one of the well known religious houses of 6th century Gaul; according to this theory her pilgrimage took place in the first half of the reign of Justinian (r.\u00a0527\u2013565). John Bernard noted that certain details of Egeria's account that support the earlier dating \u2014 two churches mentioned in the Breviarium and Peregrinatio Theodosii (both circa 530)\u2014are absent from Egeria's otherwise detailed description of Jerusalem and thus confirm the 4th century dating. Most scholars favor the 4th century date."]}, {"page": "John Bernard", "response": ["John Bernard may refer to:", "*John Bernard (MP for New Shoreham), MP for New Shoreham 1337\u20131368", "*John Bernard (MP for Hythe), MP for Hythe, 1378\u20131386", "*John Bernard (MP for Wallingford), MP for Wallingford, 1388", "*John Bernard (Ipswich MP) (died 1421), MP for Ipswich, 1387\u20131411", "*John Bernard (MP for Northallerton) (1604\u20131674), English landowner", "*Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet (1630\u20131679), MP for Huntingdon, 1660", "*John Bernard (American politician) (1893\u20131983), U.S. congressman from Minnesota", "*John Bernard (author) (died 1554), religious writer", "*John Bernard, Count of Lippe (1613\u20131652)", "*John Bernard (bishop) (1860\u20131927), Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, Irish", "*John Bernard (actor) (1756\u20131828), English actor and biographer"]}]}}
