In 1803 he led the expedition to found the first, short-lived, British settlement in what was later to become the Colony of Victoria.

The next day sailors from Sirius, a party of marines and a number of male convicts were disembarked to fell timber and clear the ground for erection of tents. The remaining large company of male convicts was disembarked from the transports over the following days. Phillip himself structured the ordering of the camp. His own tent as Governor and those of his attendant staff and servants, were set on the east side of Tank Stream and the tents of the male convicts and marines on the west. During this time priority was given to building permanent storehouses for the settlements provisions. On 29 January the Governors portable house was placed, with the livestock being landed the next day. The female convicts disembarked on 6 February, the general camp for the women was to the north of the Governors house, and separated from the male convicts by the houses of chaplain Richard Johnson and the Judge Advocate, Marine Captain David Collins. On 7 February 1788, Phillip and his government was formally inaugurated.", "The main challenge for order and harmony in the settlement came, not from the convicts secured there on terms of good behaviour, but from the attitude of officers from New South Wales Marine Corps. As Commander in Chief, Phillip was in command of both the naval and marine forces, his naval officers readily obeyed his commands, but as he sought a measure of co-operation from the marine officers that ran against their tradition. Major Robert Ross and his officers (with the exception of a few such as David Collins, Watkin Tench and William Dawes) refused to do anything other than guard duty, claiming that they were neither gaolers, supervisors nor policemen."]}, {"page": "Boomerang", "response": ["David Collins listed \"Wo-mur-r\u0101ng\" as one of eight Aboriginal \"Names of clubs\" in 1798. but was probably referring to the woomera, which is actually a spear-thrower.

In the early years of the 20th century \"kookaburra\" was included as an alternative name in ornithological publications, but it was not until 1926 in the second edition of the Official Checklist of Birds of Australia that the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union officially adopted the name \"laughing kookaburra\".

Its southern borders were as far as Botany Bay and the Georges River. Westwards it extended to Parramatta. In terms of tribal boundaries, the Kuringgai lay to the north: on the Western edges were the Darug; and to the south, around Kundul were the Gwiyagal, a northern clan of the Tharawal.
