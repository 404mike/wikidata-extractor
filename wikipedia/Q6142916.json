Sedwards also has ongoing improvisation duo work with drummer Jem Doulton.\nSedwards is noted for his guitar skills, having been a runner-up at the 1998 National Guitarist of the Year competition at Wembley, UK with the judges finding his composition and performance of the piece 'Cough Cap Kitty Cat' the \"perfect blend of technical expertise and inventiveness.\" He also came in 2nd place in the first UK Riffathon in 2003, a nationwide guitar competition in aid of Action For Brazil\u2019s Children Trust and judged by Jimmy Page and Brian May, where he played the 1973 live version of Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song'.  On many of his projects, he plays bass guitar in addition to (or instead of) six-string guitar. He has also been noted for sometimes playing his guitar with a power drill.  John Peel infamously said that Sedwards is \"the first person who's not a footballer that I've been jealous of.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thurston Moore", "response": ["In September 2014, Moore released The Best Day, a solo album featuring Steve Shelley and My Bloody Valentine's Debbie Googe as rhythm section, and James Sedwards on guitar.", "In late 2020, Moore released a solo album entitled By the Fire which featured guitarist James Sedwards and bassist Debbie Googe as on the earlier The Best Days album."]}, {"page": "Debbie Googe", "response": ["On 4 August 2014, Googe joined Thurston Moore for his solo project The Best Day, and continued this collaboration with his subsequent album Rock n Roll Consciousness in 2017, alongside Steve Shelley, and the UK musician James Sedwards."]}, {"page": "Guapo (band)", "response": ["Guapo is a British experimental rock/art rock band formed in the mid-1990s by drummer/percussionist Dave Smith and guitarist/vocalist Matt Thompson, though the band gained a wider audience with the contribution of multi-instrumentalist Daniel O'Sullivan.
