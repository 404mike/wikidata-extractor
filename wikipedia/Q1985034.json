A prize of \u00a3500 (equal to \u00a3 today) was offered to the winner of the trials.

George had courted Elizabeth before he had met Fanny, but the relationship had been put to an end by Elizabeth's father; Elizabeth had sworn at the time that she would not marry anyone else.

In addition to this role, Boyd worked closely alongside the first President, Nicholas Wood, in his efforts towards creating a schooling system for Mining Engineers as well as projects such as \u2018On a \"wash\" or \"drift\" through a portion of the coal- field of Durham\u2019 which they presented to the members of the Mining Institute in December 1863.Wood, N. & Boyd, E.F., On a \"Wash\" or \"Drift\" Throughout a Portion of the Coal-Field of Durham Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers 13, 1863-1864, 69-85. His dedication and hard working ethic resulted in his election as the fourth President of the NEIMME in 1869 following that of George Elliot. During his time in office he worked excessively on the opening of the Nicholas Wood Memorial Hall, which was to become the home of the Mining Institute, and pursued the work of Nicholas Wood in the foundation of the College of Physical College.", "The foundation of the College of Physical Science in 1871, the fore-runner of Newcastle University, is considered to be one of Boyd\u2019s most significant achievements during his presidency. Schooling was a hot topic amongst the leading members since the founding of the NEIMME and the formation of a college was desired by Nicholas Wood himself.Boyd, E.F Inaugural Address Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers 21 1871-72, 223-238 It was believed by many that schooling was essential for men in this field as no other branch of engineering required such diversified training and practise as that of a Mining Engineer. With mines being sunk deeper, mining was growing increasingly more difficult and dangerous therefore the education and professionalization of this role was deemed to be more essential. Nicholas Wood drew up an outline for a possible course lasting three years, intending for it to be purely practical and industrial in character. It was hoped that the college would be independent, however due to costs this was not feasible, hence it was decided that the College of Mining and Engineering was to be located at Durham in connection with Durham University.thumb|University of Durham King's College Mining Bulletin The University would provide and pay two professors; one of mathematics and natural philosophy and the other of applied mechanics, on the grounds that their service would be useful to both institutions. The College itself was required to provide three more; professors of Chemistry, Geology and Mine Working and Surveying and plan-drawing and Practical Engineering. With such constraints, the Miners were required to raise money for both the building and the salaries of the remaining professors. This attempt was disappointing and ultimately led to the temporary abandonment of the project.", "After the death of Nicholas Wood, the subsequent two presidents, T.E. Forster and George Elliot, made little effort to revive the project and it was not until the appointment of Edward Fenwick Boyd that the project was resurrected. He championed the importance of education and argued that workmen needed to be well directed. It was believed that managers would provide encouragement and direction, bring about punctuality, self-reliance, obedience and education,. He brought in a new initiative and successfully developed a connection with the Dean of Durham University. Boyd had been involved in the early talks regarding the formation of a College but he believed these were unsuccessful and unproductive due to a number of reasons, the most significant being the disagreements regarding the location of the College and the problems surrounding funding.", "==Opening of the Nicholas Wood Memorial Hall==", "Alongside the opening of the College of Physical Science, Boyd\u2019s presidency was also recognised for his involvement in the opening of the Nicholas Wood Memorial Hall.
