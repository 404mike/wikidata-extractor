Although the Goblin score has been variously available since the film's release, it was not until 2004 that any of the highly sought-after 60-plus cues of library music used in the film were released on a compilation album from Trunk Records. In 2009, virtually all the cues used (actually 74 of a total 86 library music pieces) were researched, identified & catalogued by Robert McLaine, Darren Stuart, John Toman, Allen Lighthiser, Patrick J. Doody, Llyswen Vaughn & Chris Stavrakis, and published on the Dawn Of The Dead Ultimate Soundtrack website.  The album included 'Cause I'm a Man' written by Cliff Twemlow and Peter Taylor under the pen name Peter Reno and recorded by the Pretty Things, and Herbert Chappell's 1965 composition \"The Gonk\" which plays over the final credits. The track is used in many references to the film including Shaun of the Dead and a variation (performed in chicken clucks) is used as the end theme to Robot Chicken. The early part of the tune to \"The Gonk\" was used in \"The Ladies' Bras\", a track by Jonny Trunk and Wisbey which, at only 36 seconds long, became the shortest ever UK top 40 single when it made number 27 on 30 September 2007. Shaun of the Dead opens with the track \"Figment\" which also features on the compilation. The album's cover is taken from a Belgian promotional poster for the film."]}, {"page": "Peter Reno", "response": ["Peter Reno was a prolific musical composition partnership between Peter Taylor (composer) and his business associate, Cliff Twemlow. They were active throughout the sixties and seventies and had music included in popular TV shows including Queenie's Castle and Crown Court (TV series) and several films including Dawn Of The Dead.
