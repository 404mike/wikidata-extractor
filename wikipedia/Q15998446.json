Although most of his designs were for buildings in Liverpool and the northwest of England, he is best known for the Parliament Buildings in Belfast, Northern Ireland (commonly known as Stormont).  Thornely was knighted in 1932, and in the following year received the Bronze Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects for Ulster.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Parliament of Northern Ireland", "response": ["Initially the Parliament met in Belfast's City Hall but then moved to the Presbyterian Church's Assembly's College (later Union Theological College), where it remained during the period 1921\u20131932.

In 1932, Parliament moved to the new purpose-built Parliament Buildings, designed by Sir Arnold Thornely, at Stormont, on the eastern outskirts of the city. \"Stormont\" came to be a synecdoche referring both to the Parliament itself and to the Northern Ireland government."]}, {"page": "Patrick Abercrombie", "response": ["In 1897, he was articled to the architect Charles Heathcote, while studying at the Manchester School of Art.

After a year working in Chester with architect Philip Lockwood, in 1907 he was offered a post as junior lecturer and studio instructor at the University of Liverpool School of Architecture.

In 1922, a design by Sir Arnold Thornely of Liverpool was chosen and preparatory work on the chosen site, east of Belfast, began.

The two stages straddled the former Chorley Street.

The original occupants included Lloyds Bank, a post office, commercial and insurance companies, solicitors, and government offices. Alfred Holt and Company occupied most of the sixth, seventh and eighth floors. Also in the building were a public hall and a constitutional club.
