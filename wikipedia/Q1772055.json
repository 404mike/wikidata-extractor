He is the twin brother of Christopher Alden, also an opera director in the revisionist mold. The two brothers have covered much of the same repertoire in their long careers, but whereas Christopher's operatic settings place greater emphasis on his characters' emotional range, David's protagonists are more broadly caricatured and his productions far more politically charged. Another distinguishing feature between them is that David has been more active in Europe throughout his career, having enjoyed a particularly close creative partnership with Sir Peter Jonas for more than two decades, at both the English National Opera and the Bavarian State Opera.", "David studied at the University of Pennsylvania and like his brother, launched his directing career with Opera Omaha in the 1970s. In 1976, he visited Europe where he immersed himself in the cultural stream of contemporary opera directors the likes of Giorgio Strehler, Harry Kupfer, Hans Neuenfels and Ruth Berghaus. Theirs was a generation of direct heirs to the Expressionist movement and, in particular, to Bertolt Brecht.  For Alden, the exposure was a revelation that unlocked intense passions he had long wanted to express in musical theater. His first European production in the late \u201870s was a Rigoletto for Scottish Opera that, he says, was assailed by the critics because \"in England, it was still very early to speak directly to the audience with the style I was attempting and place passion and schizophrenia on the stage.\"General Director Peter Jonas talks to stage director David Alden (1994)", "In 1984, Peter Jonas \u2014 formerly artistic director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra \u2014 was named to succeed the Earl of Harewood as general director of English National Opera. Together with music director Mark Elder and stage director David Pountney, they became the ruling \"Power House\" triumvirate that re-invigorated the artistic direction of ENO with a series of modernist interpretations of classic operas as well as productions of newly commissioned operas. That year, David Alden staged a controversial ENO production of Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa that became emblematic of the new era. At the end of Act II when the hero Kochubey and his friend Iskra are dragged to the executioner's block, Alden shocked his audience with a gruesome chainsaw massacre that set the tone for the bloody mad scene in Act III and forever enshrined his production in the minds of London opera goers as \"the Chainsaw Mazeppa\" that \"became a sort of shorthand for the entire Jonas project \u2014 brutal, uncompromising, unmissable, the ultimate succ\u00e8s de scandale.\"", "In 1993, Peter Jonas became intendant of the Bavarian State Opera, and from then to his departure in 2006, he made David Alden productions a mainstay of his tenure.
