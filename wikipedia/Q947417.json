In the 1890s he travelled to Japan, spending over a year making a series of around 30 paintings that were exhibited in Glasgow on his return in 1895. The proceeds from the sale of these paintings allowed him to spend \u00a3650 on buying Broughton House in 1901. Hornel lived at Broughton House with his sister Elizabeth ('Tizzy'), for the rest of his life. He commissioned his friend, the Glasgow architect John Keppie, to add a studio to the house, and in 1910 Keppie designed the gallery. A successful artist, Hornel continued to travel in the Far East, and also collected rare books. After Hornel's death in 1933, his sister continued to live at Broughton House until her death in 1950, after which the property was managed by The Broughton House Trust before being transferred to the National Trust for Scotland.

In 1895, she exhibited work at the Stephen Goodden Art Rooms in Glasgow, and in 1896 at the Munich Secession Exhibition. That year she spent time in the artist's colony of Kirkcudbright, where she painted the portrait of leading Kirkcudbright artist Edward Atkinson Hornel. In 1899 she married Alexander Frew, a physician and artist, and they lived in the Hillhead area of Glasgow, where she set up a large studio at the back of the house. Both her parents died in 1903, and she was in the late stages of a pregnancy when she died in Glasgow on 4 June 1904, at the age of 34. Her husband remarried shortly before his own death by suicide in 1908, and his second wife sold the Hillhead house and all of MacNicol's paintings the same year.
