He describes the nature of bibliography as \"the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception\" (1999 12). This concept broadens the scope of bibliography to include \"non-book texts\" and an accounting for their material form and structure, as well as textual variations, technical and production processes that bring sociocultural context and effects into play. McKenzie's perspective contextualizes textual objects or artefacts with sociological and technical factors that have an effect on production, transmission and, ultimately, ideal copy (2002 14). Bibliography, generally, concerns the material conditions of books [as well as other texts] how they are designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted, collected.Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (2000)."]}, {"page": "Long s", "response": ["* The Caslon typeface of 1732 has the long s.Philip Gaskell, New Introduction to Bibliography, Clarendon, 1972, p. 210, Figs 74, 75."]}, {"page": "Mass media in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In 1477 William Caxton in Westminster printed The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres, considered \"the first dated book printed in England.\" The history of the book in the United Kingdom has been studied from a variety of cultural, economic, political, and social angles.

Bulmer, cut by the brother of Baskerville's foremen, was one design inspired by it, as is the Bell type cut by Richard Austin. Austin's biographer Alastair Johnston has described this period as a \"glorious but short-lived\" period of innovative type design in Britain \"of harmonious types that had the larger-on-the-body proportions of the Romain du Roi, with the modelling of Baskerville but more colour and fine serifs\". Philip Gaskell particularly highlights as a successful typeface of this period the Wilson foundry of Glasgow's 'startling' English-sized (14 pt) roman of 1760, following soon from Baskerville's first editions of 1757 and cut extremely large for its point size: \"Baskerville's influence is obvious, but Wilson has outdone the master in the width, weight and even the size of the face. I think myself that with its large x-height, generous width and clean execution, this elegant fount carries out Baskerville's ideas better than did Baskerville himself.\" This period saw an increasing influence of Didone printing from the Continent, in particular the types of the Didot family and the editions published by Bodoni. The style then disappeared from view altogether following a full trend towards Didone typefaces, often with a much darker style of impression; Updike suggests that this change mostly happened around 1815\u201320. The Scotch Roman genre which proved popular in Britain and America is something of an intermediate between Didone typefaces and Baskerville's influence. The succession of more extreme \"Didone\" typefaces quickly replacing Baskerville's style has led to Baskerville being called \"transitional\" on the road to the Didone style which dominated printing for a long period, although of course Baskerville would not have considered his design \"transitional\" but as a successful end in itself."]}, {"page": "Morvern", "response": ["The history of the parish of Morvern in the 19th century has been detailed in Philip Gaskell's Morvern Transformed."]}, {"page": "Rosa Lewis", "response": ["The 1976-77 BBC television series, The Duchess of Duke Street, starring Gemma Jones, was loosely based on her life.\"Read the Book, Darling,\" Charles McGrath.
