His 2008 film, The Market: A Tale of Trade (Turkish: Pazar: Bir Ticaret Masal\u0131) won awards at film festivals in Locarno, Ghent and Antalya, where it was the first film directed by a foreigner to win an award in the national competition.In 2021, Ben Hopkins wrote a novel called Cathedral. David Wiley in a review on the Rain Taxi, writes that Hopkins as a screenwriter and filmmaker, Hopkins also employs far more filmic allusions than literary ones, such as stone facedly referencing Monty Python at two very unfunny moments and making a few glancing nods toward The Princess Bride, another work of a great screenwriter/novelist. Nicknaming his jejune stonecutter \u201cRettich\u201d and placing great stress on the association with the word radish, Hopkins almost certainly invokes the celebrated Chartres scene in F for Fake, during which Welles mistily refers to the contemporary human as a \u201cpoor forked radish,\u201d an allusion to Thomas Carlyle\u2019s riff on Falstaff\u2019s description of Robert Shallow in Henry IV, Part 2. That\u2019s quite a thread of association from film to architecture to literature, and Hopkins dispenses with that thread on the novel\u2019s first page. Otherwise largely literature free in its associative language and aesthetic order, this brilliantly imagined, gorgeously designed, and deeply profound novel is nonetheless a magnificent work of literature itself.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sitges Film Festival", "response": ["|Ben Hopkins (Simon Magus)"]}, {"page": "Evening Standard British Film Awards", "response": ["*Most Promising Newcomer : Ben Hopkins \u2013 The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz"]}, {"page": "56th Berlin International Film Festival", "response": ["**Ben Hopkins for 37 Uses for a Dead Sheep"]}, {"page": "Ali Cook", "response": ["*2014 Lost In Karastan, Film and Music Entertainment, Ben Hopkins"]}, {"page": "2000 Toronto International Film Festival", "response": ["* The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz by Ben Hopkins"]}, {"page": "Simon Magus (film)", "response": ["Simon Magus is a 1999 British mystery film directed by Ben Hopkins and starring Stuart Townsend.
