D. Cohen, Folk Music: the Basics (CRC Press, 2006), p. 98. Sales of guitars grew rapidly, and other musicians were able to perform on improvised bass and percussion in venues such as church halls and cafes and in the flourishing coffee bars of Soho, London, like the 2i's Coffee Bar, the Cat's Whisker and nightspots like Coconut Grove and Churchill's, without having to aspire to musical perfection or virtuosity. A large number of British musicians began their careers playing skiffle in this period, and some became leading figures in their respective fields. These included leading Northern Irish musician Van Morrison and British blues pioneer Alexis Korner, as well as Ronnie Wood, Alex Harvey and Mick Jagger; folk musicians Martin Carthy, John Renbourn and Ashley Hutchings; rock musicians Roger Daltrey, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Robin Trower and David Gilmour; and popular Beat-music successes Graham Nash and Allan Clarke of the Hollies.C.

The family subsequently returned to Salford, where Nash grew up. In the early 1960s he co-founded the Hollies, one of the UK's most successful pop groups, with school friend Allan Clarke, and was credited as the group's leader on their first album. He was featured vocally on \"Just One Look\" (1964) and sang his first lead vocal on the original Hollies song \"To You My Love\" on the band's second album In The Hollies Style of the same year. He often sang featured bridge vocals on later Hollies recordings (\"So Lonely\", \"I've Been Wrong\", \"Pay You Back With Interest\") and provided lead vocals on several later singles, notably \"On a Carousel\"  and \"Carrie Anne\" (both 1967).", "In 1965, Nash, with Allan Clarke and guitarist Tony Hicks, formed Gralto Music Ltd, a publishing company which handled their own songs and later signed the young Reg Dwight (a.k.a.

He subsequently worked in a variety of musical ventures and appeared on television and radio. In 2000, he replaced Allan Clarke as lead singer of the Hollies and performed with them as lead singer until his death from cancer in 2004."]}, {"page": "The Hollies", "response": ["The Hollies are a British pop rock group formed in 1962. One of the leading British groups of the 1960s and into the mid 1970s, they are known for their distinctive three-part vocal harmony style. Allan Clarke and Graham Nash founded the band as a Merseybeat-type music group in Manchester, although some of the band members came from towns further north in East Lancashire. Graham Nash left the group in 1968 to form Crosby, Stills & Nash.", "The Hollies originated as a duo formed by Allan Clarke and Graham Nash, who were best friends from primary school and began performing together during the skiffle craze of the late 1950s.Dawn Eden, 30th Anniversary essay, March 1993, in 30th Anniversary Collection. Eventually Clarke and Nash became a vocal and guitar duo modelled on American duo the Everly Brothers under the names \"Ricky and Dane Young.\" Under this name, they teamed up with a local band, the Fourtones, consisting of Pete Bocking on guitar, John 'Butch' Mepham on bass, Keith Bates on drums, and Derek Quinn on guitar.  When Quinn quit to join Freddie and the Dreamers in 1962, Clarke and Nash also quit and joined another Manchester band, the Deltas, consisting of Vic Steele on lead guitar, Eric Haydock on bass guitar, and Don Rathbone on drums, which had just lost two members including Eric Stewart, who left to join a \"professional\" band, the Mindbenders. During these periods the group were managed and promoted by Michael Cohen, a music enthusiast and clothing retailer from Oldham.", "The Hollies' next single, \"I Can't Tell the Bottom from the Top\", again featured the young Elton John on piano and reached UK No. 7 in May 1970, charting in twelve countries.

Allan Clarke's hard-edged rocker \"Hey Willy\" made No. 22 in the UK in 1971 and charted in eight other countries.", "Like Graham Nash before him, frontman Allan Clarke by 1971 was growing frustrated, and he too began clashing with producer Ron Richards over material; after seeing Nash's success since departing, he was eager to leave the group and cut a solo album. After the 1971 album Distant Light, which concluded the band's EMI/Parlophone contract in the UK (and reached No. 21 on the American Billboard chart), Clarke departed from the Hollies in December, a move which surprised both the band's fans and the public in general.", "The Hollies signed with Polydor for the UK/Europe in 1972, although their US contract with Epic still had three more albums to run. Swedish singer Mikael Rickfors, formerly of the group Bamboo (who had supported the Hollies in Sweden in 1967), was quickly recruited by the rest of the band and sang lead on the group's first Polydor single \"The Baby\" (UK No. 26, March 1972). When Mikael first auditioned for them, he tried to sing in Allan Clarke's higher vocal range, and the results were terrible.Circus Magazine, May 1973. \u2013 \"Romany \u2013 The Hollies Hop Over Disaster\" by Janis Schacht. The rest of the group decided it might be better to record songs with him starting from scratch. Terry Sylvester and Tony Hicks blended with Rickfors' baritone voice instead of him trying to imitate Clarke's tenor voice. There were rumours that Rickfors couldn't speak a word of English and had to learn the words of \"The Baby\" phonetically. The rumour about him not knowing English was false, though he did struggle to understand English words that he had not put together.", "Allan Clarke retired in February 2000.
