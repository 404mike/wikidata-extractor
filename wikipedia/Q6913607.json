It took positions on the front line for the first time on March 3, 1945 along the south bank of the Senio River, and immediately began engaging in small-scale actions against German forces, facing the 42nd J\u00e4ger Division and the 362nd Infantry Division. The brigade carried out aggressive patrolling during which it engaged in numerous firefights in order to improve its positions, clear the south bank of German troops, and take prisoners, and carried out small-scale raids against German positions across the river to test the enemy's strength and map out enemy defensive positions. In one notable raid, it was supported by tanks of the North Irish Horse and South African Air Force fighter aircraft. The South African pilots, many of whom were Jewish, flew in a Star of David formation during their attack run as a tribute to the brigade. During the raid, the brigade's infantrymen ran ahead of the tanks and mopped up the German positions, returning with prisoners and greatly impressing the seasoned troops of the North Irish Horse.Morris Beckman, The Jewish Brigade, Chapter 6 The brigade first entered into major combat operations on March 19\u201320, 1945 at Alfonsine. In its first sustained action on March 19, the brigade killed 19 German soldiers and took 11 prisoner for the loss of 2 dead and 3 wounded in a series of clashes. The brigade then moved to the Senio River sector, where on March 27 it fought against elements of the German 4th Parachute Division commanded by Generalleutnant Heinrich Trettner. From April 1-9, the brigade again engaged the Germans in a series of small-scale clashes. It returned to offensive operations during the \"Three Rivers Battle\", crossing the Senio River on April 10 and capturing the two positions allocated to it, establishing a bridgehead and widening it the following day. It was assigned to clear out a German redoubt to the left of its position that another Allied unit had failed to capture. The brigade managed to complete the mission in a fierce battle, wiping out all enemy positions in fifteen minutes.Morris Beckman, The Jewish Brigade, Chapter 9Jewish Brigade Group It subsequently engaged in a series of small-scale clashes and captured Monte Ghebbio in a battle with German paratroopers. The brigade was then removed from the frontline for rest and refit before the liberation of Bologna (April 21, 1945). The brigade's engineering units also assisted in bridging the Po River to enable Allied forces to cross it. The Jewish Brigade spent 48 days on the frontline in Italy - March 3 to April 20, 1945.", "The Jewish Brigade fought well and its men were eager to make contact with the enemy by any means available to them. Their staff work, their commands and their assessments were good. If they get enough help they certainly deserve to be part of any field force whatsoever.Morris Beckman, The Jewish Brigade, p. 94", "There are indications that brigade members summarily executed surrendering German soldiers, particularly SS soldiers, in order to take revenge for the Holocaust. Although Brigadier Benjamin urged his troops not to kill surrendering Germans, emphasizing that intelligence gleaned from interrogation of prisoners would hasten the end of the war, he and his staff understood the desire for vengeance among the soldiers, and no Jewish Brigade soldier was ever punished for killing or otherwise mistreating surrendering enemy troops.Morris Beckman, The Jewish Brigade, p. 77", "The Jewish Brigade also joined groups of Holocaust survivors in forming assassination squads known as the Nakam for the purpose of tracking down and killing former SS and Wehrmacht officers who had participated in atrocities against European Jews. Information regarding the whereabouts of these fugitives was gathered either by torturing imprisoned Nazis or by way of military connections. The British uniforms, military documentation, equipment, and vehicles used by Jewish Brigade veterans greatly contributed to the success of the Nokmim. The number of Nazis the Nokmim killed is unknown, but may have been as high as 1,500.Morris Beckman, The Jewish Brigade, p. 213Ian Black and Benny Morris: Israel's Secret Wars: A History of Israel's Intelligence Services, p. 188", "In 1948, after the Israeli Declaration of Independence, many Jewish Brigade veterans served with distinction in the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Many veterans would serve as high-ranking officers in the Israeli military, 35 becoming generals.Morris Beckman, The Jewish Brigade, p. 140", "thumb|7th armored Brigade Among the brigade's soldiers, 78 were mentioned in dispatches, and 20 received military decorations (7 Military Medals, 7 Order of the British Empire medals, 4 Military Crosses, and 2 US awards).Morris Beckman, The Jewish Brigade, p. 161 Veterans of the Brigade were later entitled to the Volunteer Ribbon and the Fighters against Nazis Medal of the State of Israel. On 3 October 2018, after a unanimous support vote by the Italian Parliament, the war flag of the Jewish Brigade Group was awarded the Italian \"Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare\" for its contribution to the liberation of Italy during WW2. The medal was attached to the warflag of the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade, heirs of the Jewish Brigade Group, in a celebration at the Bet Hagdudim (Battalions Museum) in Avihayil."]}, {"page": "Hackney Downs School", "response": ["* Morris Beckman"]}, {"page": "Morris Beckman", "response": ["Morris Beckman is the name of:", "*Morris Beckman (architect), American architect", "*Morris Beckman (writer) (1921\u20132015), English writer"]}, {"page": "Morris (given name)", "response": ["*Morris Beckman (architect), American architect", "*Morris Beckman (writer) (1921\u20132015), English writer"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Morris Beckman, 94, writer and anti-fascist activist (43 Group)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2015", "response": ["*Morris Beckman, 94, English writer and anti-fascist activist (43 Group)."]}]}}
