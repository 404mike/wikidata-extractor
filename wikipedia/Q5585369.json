But it also exacerbated Hindu-Muslim differences. The festival organizers would urge Hindus to protect cows and boycott the Muharram celebrations organized by Shi'a Muslims, in which Hindus had formerly often participated. Thus, although the celebrations were meant to be a way to oppose colonial rule, they also contributed to religious tensions. Contemporary Marathi Hindu nationalist parties like the Shiv Sena took up his reverence for Shivaji. However, Indian Historian, Uma Chakravarti cites Professor Gordon Johnson and states \"It is significant that even at the time when Tilak was making political use of Shivaji the question of conceding Kshatriya status to him as Maratha was resisted by the conservative Brahmins including Tilak. While Shivaji was a Brave man, all his bravery, it was argued, did not give him the right to a status that very nearly approached that of a Brahmin. Further, the fact that Shivaji worshiped the Brahmanas in no way altered social relations, 'since it was as a Shudra he did it \u2013 as a Shudra the servant, if not the slave, of the Brahmin'\"."]}, {"page": "Wolfson College, Cambridge", "response": ["* 1993 to 2010: Gordon Johnsonhttp://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk/officers/"]}, {"page": "Reginald Dyer", "response": ["Historian Gordon Johnson commented that \"...Dyer's actions ran counter to Army regulations. These required that force should be constrained by what was reasonable to achieve an immediate objective; minimum, not maximum, force should be deployed. Moreover, proper warning had to be given. On 13 April 1919, as demonstrated by Collett, Dyer ignored this. While he may have believed the Raj was threatened, and may have thought the mob was out to attack him and his soldiers, this does not justify his cavalier abuse of procedure and his indifference to Indian suffering. In so behaving, he brought not only death to the innocent but also destroyed himself and undermined the empire in which he took so much pride.\""]}, {"page": "Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland", "response": ["* 2015-2018 Gordon Johnson ", "* 2009\u20132012 Gordon Johnson"]}, {"page": "Microcosmographia Academica", "response": ["Gordon Johnson included it in his 2008 book University Politics: F.

McKirdy also says the book is a well referenced addition to other books which cover this time in history. Chandar S. Sundaram writing for Itinerario has said that this was the \"definitive work\" on the massacre and that Collett had detailed the life of Dyer with exceptional skill. Nicholas Fearn writing for The Independent said the book was a \"thorough reconstruction\" of the massacre and that the book was \"heavily detailed treatment and serious to the point of dryness.\" He also said that because of the material Dyer could be compared to General Melchett from the comedy show Blackadder Goes Forth.
