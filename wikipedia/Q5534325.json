He returned to the position as leader of the British Mathematical Olympiad from 2013.Smith oversaw a quantitative increase in training: annual events in Bath (moving to The Queen's College, Oxford from 2009), at Oundle School, in Hungary, at Trinity College, Cambridge, and immediately prior to the IMO itself. He also thrice won the IMO Golden Microphone, awarded to the national team leader who makes the most speeches to the IMO Jury. In 2010 he was elected to the IMO Advisory Board for a four-year period. Smith was elected as the chair of the International Mathematical Olympiad for the term of 2014-2018 and was re-elected in 2018.Smith also prepared UK teams for the Romanian Masters in Mathematics tournament (which they won in 2008), and for participation as guests at the annual Balkan Mathematical Olympiad.\nAs well as group theory, he is also interested in Euclidean geometry. He often collaborates with Christopher Bradley and David Monk, and has published several papers on Forum Geometricorum, the online geometry journal.In June 2011 Smith was awarded an MBE for services to education following his contributions toward organising Royal Institution Maths Masterclasses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trinity School of John Whitgift", "response": ["*Geoff Smith MBE, mathematician"]}, {"page": "Geoff Smith", "response": ["Geoff Smith may refer to:", "*Geoff Smith (music composer) (born 1966), English composer, academic and vice chancellor of Regent's University London", "*Geoff Smith (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20132013), English footballer", "*Geoff Smith (politician) (born 1934), former Australian politician", "*Geoff Smith (Essex cricketer) (born 1935), former English cricketer", "*Geoff Smith (Kent cricketer) (1925\u20132016), English amateur cricketer", "*Geoff Smith (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1953), cricketer for Canterbury", "*Geoff Smith (cyclist) (1942\u20132018), Australian Olympic cyclist", "*Geoff Smith (decathlete) (born 1945), Australian decathlete", "*Geoff Smith (Australian footballer) (born 1948), Australian rules footballer", "*Geoff Smith (runner) (born 1953), British marathon runner", "*Geoff Smith (mathematician) (born 1953), former leader of the United Kingdom International Mathematical Olympiad team", "*Geoff Smith (businessman) (born 1955), Canadian businessman", "*Geoff Smith (British musician) (born 1961), English musician", "*Geoff Smith (ice hockey) (born 1969), former National Hockey League defenceman"]}, {"page": "Dan Segal", "response": ["His postgraduate students have included Marcus du Sautoy and Geoff Smith.
