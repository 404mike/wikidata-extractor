On 26 August, Wallace was accused of abandoning Pen Farthing, who ran an animal sanctuary in Kabul and was seeking permission for a private jet to be given clearance by the Ministry of Defence to get 71 people and more than 100 animals to the UK. The next day, he gave clearance for the $500,000 private plane to land at Kabul Airport. Wallace said Ministry of Defence staff had suffered abuse from some of Farthing's supporters."]}, {"page": "Nawzad, Afghanistan", "response": ["The animal rescue charity Nowzad Dogs, founded by Pen Farthing, is named after the town."]}, {"page": "CNN Heroes", "response": ["* Pen Farthing of the United Kingdom: 2014 CNN Hero of the year"]}, {"page": "Nowzad Dogs", "response": ["The Nowzad Dogs charity was created by Pen Farthing a former Royal Marines commando after rescuing a dog he called Nowzad whilst serving in the town of Nawzad in Afghanistan .", "The charity's founder Pen Farthing was nominated for the Lifetime Achievement award at the Daily Mirror and RSPCA Animal Hero Awards in 2013, for his work with the Nowzad charity.

Visas for 68 people, including the staff of the charity and their immediate family members, had originally been granted on 23 August, but Farthing chose not to leave immediately. Permission for the charity's animals (173 dogs and cats) to be airlifted was granted two days later, but they were blocked from entering the airport on 26 August, and then on 27 August, the Afghan staff of the charity were blocked from boarding the evacuation flight. Farthing left Afghanistan along with the animals, but not his staff, on 28 August. Some journalists criticized this prioritizing animals over people as racist, and damaging to Westerners\u2019 reputation among local people."]}]}}
