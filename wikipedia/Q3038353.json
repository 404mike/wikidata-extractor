The Catholicism of Shakespeare's Plays. Tokyo: Renaissance Institute, Sophia University (1997); reprinted Southampton: Saint Austin Press (1997). .Milward, Peter. Shakespeare the Papist. Ann Arbor, MI: Sapientia Press (2005). . Asquith believed that Shakespeare uses terms such as \"high\" when referring to Catholic characters and \"low\" when referring to Protestants (the terms refer to their altars) and \"light\" or \"fair\" to refer to Catholic and \"dark\" to refer to Protestant, a reference to certain clerical garbs. Asquith also detects in Shakespeare's work the use of a simple code used by the Jesuit underground in England which took the form of a mercantile terminology wherein priests were \"merchants\" and souls were \"jewels\", those pursuing them were \"creditors\", and the Tyburn gallows, where the members of the underground died, was called \"the place of much trading\".Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare (2005) by Clare Asquith. The Jesuit underground used this code so their correspondences looked like innocuous commercial letters, and Asquith believed that Shakespeare also used this code. Asquith's conclusions, however, have met with considerable criticism and evidence of a hidden code has been called \"dubious\". According to professor Jeffrey Knapp, the work of scholars like Peter Milward, who believe that \"the deepest inspiration in Shakespeare's plays is both religious and Christian\", has had \"little influence on recent Shakespeare scholarship\". John Finnis and Patrick Martin have argued more recently that Catholic martyr Anne Line is the eponymous phoenix of The Phoenix and the Turtle and her husband Roger is the eponymous turtle.Times Literary Supplement, 18 April 2003, pp. 12\u201314 They believe, with Asquith, that the poem's \"bird of loudest lay\" represents the composer William Byrd and that the crow is the Jesuit Henry Garnet.Asquith, Clare, Shakespeare Newsletter, 50, 2001.", "Although Shakespeare commonly adapted existing tales, typically myths or works in another language, Joseph Pearce claims that King John, King Lear and Hamlet were all works that had been done recently and in English with an anti-Catholic bias, and that Shakespeare's versions appear to be a refutation of the source plays.Pearce (2008: 181\u201382) Pearce believes otherwise he would not have \"reinvented the wheel\", revisiting recent English plays. Peter Milward is among those who hold the view that Shakespeare engaged in rebuttal of recent English \"anti-Papist\" works. Again, David Beauregard points out that, in the Italian source for Measure for Measure, the secular heroine is seduced and finally married, but Shakespeare revises his characterisation, so that her counterpart Isabella becomes a Poor Clare novice who maintains her virginity and does not marry.Beauregard, David (2008: 71\u201374) On the other hand, Jonathan Bate describes the process of Leir transformation into Lear as replacing the \"external trappings of Christianity\" with a pagan setting. He adds that the devils plaguing \"Poor Tom\" in Shakespeare's version have the same names as the evil spirits in a book by Samuel Harsnett, later Archbishop of York, that denounces the \"fake\" Catholic practice of exorcism.From Harsnett, Samuel (1603).

In a few places the playwright has translated the Book of Genesis using the original Hebrew.  In addition, there are many other church and religious references.  For example, in 1999 in his study of Julius Caesar, Professor Steve Sohmer argues that the playwright \"set out to interrogate the truth of the Gospels\".Steve Sohmer, Shakespeare's Mystery Play;The Opening of the Globe Theatre 1599, Manchester University Press (1999), pgs 188,197 Similarly in 1988 Linda Hoff posited that Hamlet is entirely a religious allegory.Linda Kay Hoff, Hamlet's Choice; Hamlet A Reformation Allegory, Lewiston; E.Mellon Press (1988).

Shakespeare and the Bible, Oxford University Press, p. 13 Marx further notes that \"it is possible that Shakespeare sometimes regarded his own role of playwright and performer as godlike, his own book as potent and capacious as 'The Book'.\"Marx, Steven (2000).
