In the second leg, watched by 60,000 spectators, Roma won by two goals to nil\u00a0\u2013 an own goal when an attempted clearance rebounded off Brian Farmer's shin, and a shot from distance by Paolo Pestrin very late in the game while Birmingham's players were all upfield attacking\u00a0\u2013 in the Stadio Olimpico to win their first and, , only trophy in European competition.", "In Copenhagen, melted snow and rain left standing water on the pitch, and the kickoff had been moved to late afternoon so that the match against KB could be televised. This meant the attendance was very low, and the floodlighting was inadequate. Having twice taken a two-goal lead, Birmingham conceded two late goals and the game ended 4\u20134. Young goalkeeper Colin Withers had let in six goals in his first appearance as replacement for Johnny Schofield, who had fractured his skull, but made several saves to keep Birmingham from losing this match. The Daily Mirror reporter suggested that if the other forwards had taken full advantage of new signing Jimmy Bloomfield's creativity, the score would have been rather different. The score in the home leg was indeed different. Goals from Robin Stubbs (2), Bloomfield, Mike Hellawell, and debutant Jimmy Harris gave Birmingham a 9\u20134 aggregate victory.", "The game was even for the first half-hour, then Manfredini scored a shot on the turn to give Roma the lead. They doubled their lead a quarter of an hour into the second half, \"thanks once more to the brilliant opportunism of Manfredini\", whom the Birmingham Mail described as \"a splendid centre-forward who acted as a one-man attack for most of the match\". Despite most of the attacking play coming from the home side, they found Cudicini in excellent form, and it was not until the last ten minutes of the match that Mike Hellawell's snap-shot surprised the goalkeeper to make it 2-1. With just two minutes left of normal time, Harris hit the bar, and in a goalmouth scramble, the ball was forced home by Bryan Orritt\u00a0\u2013 who had fallen out of favour and been on the transfer list for several months\u00a0\u2013 to give Birmingham a late equaliser.", "|OR||7|| Mike Hellawell", "The trophy was presented to Losi, the Roma captain, by Sir Stanley Rous, newly elected president of FIFA.

They were not surprised that Birmingham were bottom of the league, and rated only Trevor Smith and the 18-year-old Mike Hellawell as good players. Merrick agreed \"that Roma were the better footballing side and deserved to win. But they did not show any sportsmanship.\" Media both English and Italian singled out Lojacono as \"the outstanding performer\" who \"outgeneralled\" his opponents, but whose \"fiery temper\u00a0...continually spoiled a superb performance\"; who provoked his opponents, started fights and man-handled the referee but was instrumental in the move that forced Farmer's own goal and was involved in the late winner.", "|OR||7|| Mike Hellawell"]}, {"page": "Football League Third Division North versus South representative matches", "response": ["| Mike Hellawell"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-five players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were fifteen different goalscorers.
