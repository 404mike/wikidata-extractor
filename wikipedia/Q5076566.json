The Curator of the Hereford Club, Dr. H. G. Bull, convinced the members in 1867 to undertake the particular study of mushrooms. While the mycological efforts of the Club diminished somewhat after Dr. Bull's death, the Union of Yorkshire founded its  Mycological Committee in 1892. This Committee attracted the involvement of many eminent mycologists including George Edward Massee (1845\u20131917), James Needham (1849\u20131913), Charles Crossland (1844-1916), and Henry Thomas Soppitt (1843-1899). Mycologist Kathleen Sampson was a member for sixty years, as well as serving as president in 1938.", "The need for a national organisation and the need for a journal to publish their observations led Cooke, Rea, Massee, and other mycologists (including Charles Crossland and  James Needham) to found the Society in 1896. The Society's founding officers were Rea (Secretary), Crossland (Treasurer), and Massee (President). The choice of the latter as President was based on his international reputation (with more than 250 mycological publications) and role as the mycologist at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew (where he replaced Cooke as mycologist in 1893). In 1897, Rea assumed the additional role of Treasurer, also continuing as Secretary (until 1918), and was also Editor (until 1930). However, Massee and a number of Yorkshire mycologists soon left the BMS, preferring to remain with the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union."]}, {"page": "Crossl.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Crossland"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (C)", "response": ["* Crossl. \u2013 Charles Crossland (1844\u20131916)"]}, {"page": "Crossland, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Crossland"]}, {"page": "John Farrah", "response": ["John Farrah, F.L.S., F.R.Met.S (28 May 1849 \u2013 13 November 1907) was a British grocer, confectioner, biologist and meteorologist from Harrogate, North Riding of Yorkshire, England. In the late 19th century he developed the business strategy for Farrah's toffee shop which he inherited from his family in Harrogate. He was made a fellow of the Meteorological Society in 1894. He was president of the botanical section of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, working with Thomas Sheppard, George Edward Massee, William Eagle Clarke and Charles Crossland, and in 1903 discovered the mycological species Entoloma farrahi, which was named after him, although there has been some question as to its identity since then. He was a close friend of Harrogate historian William Grainge and for some years they were \"constant companions\", supporting each other in their work. The American mycologist George Francis Atkinson described him as a \"great Yorkshire character\". Farrah married three times, and had three children.", "In 1948, the 1904 description of Entoloma farrahi by George Edward Massee and Charles Crossland was re-examined, and was judged to be dubious, on account of not being an Entoloma due to the given smooth shape of the spores. The spore size (to 10.8\u00b5m in length), if assumed to be correct even if the shape is wrong, would only fit E. bloxamii. However, the fruit body which Farrah found in 1903 would closely resemble the endangered Entoloma species: big blue pinkgill, specifically E. atromadidum whose indigo colour (shading to black) is identical, if the 1904 drawing of the smooth spores were taken as an error.See British and Irish Basidio Checklist: \"Entoloma farrahii Massee & Crossl., Naturalist Hull: 1 (1904) Notes: Described from England (Yorkshire) but a nomen dubium.
