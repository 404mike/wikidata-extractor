He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art and edited BLAST, the literary magazine of the Vorticists.His novels include Tarr (1918) and The Human Age trilogy, composed of The Childermass (1928), Monstre Gai (1955) and Malign Fiesta (1955). A fourth volume, titled The Trial of Man, was unfinished at the time of his death.

In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character. Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence. Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration. Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence. Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly Fordism and scientific management. Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures\u2014such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Ernst J\u00fcnger, Gottfried Benn, Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis.\"Fascist Modernism\" by Jobst Welge.

His articles were eventually collected and published in The Battle of Tripoli. He then covered the First Balkan War of 1912\u201313, witnessing the surprise success of Bulgarian troops against the Ottoman Empire in the Siege of Adrianople. In this period he also made a number of visits to London, which he considered 'the Futurist city par excellence', and where a number of exhibitions, lectures and demonstrations of Futurist music were staged. However, although a number of artists, including Wyndham Lewis, were interested in the new movement, only one British convert was made, the young artist C.R.W. Nevinson. Nevertheless, Futurism was an important influence upon Lewis's Vorticist philosophy.Haycock, A Crisis of Brilliance (London: Old Street Publishing, 2009), 138\u201340, 142, 147, 187\u20138"]}, {"page": "Henri Bergson", "response": ["on the subject).

Joyce initially called it Work in Progress after Ford Madox Ford called it by that name when a portion of the work, the \"Mamalujo\" episode, was published in his magazine, The Transatlantic Review, in April 1924. Joyce did not publicly reveal the name of his work, Finnegans Wake, until  1939. In 1926, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas, who offered to serialize the book in their magazine transition.  When it first came out, some of Joyce's supporters- like Stanislaus , Pound, and Weaver- commented negatively on it, and it was criticized by writers like Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in, Wyndham Lewis, and Rebecca West.  In response, the Jolas, with the support of Joyce, organized the publication of a book of positive, previously written essays called Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress, which included writings by Samuel Beckett and William Carlos Williams, that was meant as a reply to these critics as well as to market Work in Progress to audiences. Finnegans Wake was completed in 1939, and was published by Faber and Faber with the assistance of T. S. Eliot."]}, {"page": "K\u00fcnstlerroman", "response": ["*1918 Wyndham Lewis's Tarr"]}, {"page": "Modernism", "response": ["Another strong influence at this time was Marxism. After the generally primitivistic/irrationalist aspect of pre-World War I Modernism (which for many modernists precluded any attachment to merely political solutions) and the neoclassicism of the 1920s (as represented most famously by T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky\u2014which rejected popular solutions to modern problems), the rise of fascism, the Great Depression, and the march to war helped to radicalise a generation. Bertolt Brecht, W. H. Auden, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Louis Aragon and the philosophers Antonio Gramsci and Walter Benjamin are perhaps the most famous exemplars of this Modernist form of Marxism. There were, however, also modernists explicitly of 'the right', including Salvador Dal\u00ed, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, the Dutch author Menno ter Braak and others.Pericles Lewis, \"Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics\" (review).

As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities. During this period, he published his first major work, The Mechanical Bride (1951), in which he examines the effect of advertising on society and culture. Throughout the 1950s, he and Edmund Carpenter also produced an important academic journal called Explorations. McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the Toronto School of communication theory, together with Harold Innis, Eric A. Havelock, and Northrop Frye. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer Sheila Watson on the subject of Wyndham Lewis. Hoping to keep him from moving to another institute, the University of Toronto created the Centre for Culture and Technology (CCT) in 1963."]}, {"page": "November 18", "response": ["*  1882   \u2013 Wyndham Lewis, English painter and critic (d. 1957)"]}, {"page": "T.

He subsequently taught at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. To earn extra money, he wrote book reviews and lectured at evening extension courses at University College London and Oxford. In 1917, he took a position at Lloyds Bank in London, working on foreign accounts. On a trip to Paris in August 1920 with the artist Wyndham Lewis, he met the writer James Joyce. Eliot said he found Joyce arrogant, and Joyce doubted Eliot's ability as a poet at the time, but the two writers soon became friends, with Eliot visiting Joyce whenever he was in Paris.Ellmann, Richard. James Joyce. pp. 492\u2013495. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis also maintained a close friendship, leading to Lewis's later making his well-known portrait painting of Eliot in 1938."]}, {"page": "Thomas Pynchon", "response": ["Pynchon's work also has similarities with writers in the modernist tradition who wrote long novels dealing with large metaphysical or political issues, such as Ulysses by James Joyce, A Passage to India by E. M. Forster, The Apes of God by Wyndham Lewis, The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil and the U.S.A. trilogy by John Dos Passos. Pynchon explicitly acknowledges his debt to Beat Generation writers, and expresses his admiration for Jack Kerouac's On the Road in particular. He also outlines the specific influence on his own early fiction of literary works by T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, Saul Bellow, Herbert Gold, Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, John Buchan and Graham Greene, and non-fiction works by Helen Waddell, Norbert Wiener and Isaac Asimov."]}, {"page": "Virginia Woolf", "response": ["Hermione Lee cites a number of extracts from Woolf's writings that many, including Lee, would consider offensive, and these criticisms can be traced back as far as those of Wyndham Lewis and Q.D. Leavis in the 1920s and 1930s. Other authors provide more nuanced contextual interpretations, and stress the complexity of her character and the apparent inherent contradictions in analysing her apparent flaws. She could certainly be off-hand, rude and even cruel in her dealings with other authors, translators and biographers, such as her treatment of Ruth Gruber. Some authors, particularly postcolonial feminists dismiss her (and modernist authors in general) as privileged, elitist, classist, racist, and antisemitic."]}, {"page": "Wassily Kandinsky", "response": ["These ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world.See Michael Paraskos, \"English Expressionism,\" MRes Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds 1997, p103f As early as 1912, On the Spiritual in Art was reviewed by Michael Sadleir in the London-based Art News.Michael Sadleir, Review of Uber da Geistige an der Kunst by Wassily Kandinsky, in \"The Art News,\" 9 March 1912, p.45. Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of On the Spiritual in Art in 1914. Extracts from the book were published that year in Percy Wyndham Lewis's periodical Blast, and Alfred Orage's weekly cultural newspaper The New Age. Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists' Exhibition (organised by Frank Rutter) at London's Royal Albert Hall. This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist Spencer Frederick Gore in The Art News.Spencer Frederick Gore, \"The Allied Artists' Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall (London)\", in \"The Art News,\" 4 August 1910, p.254."]}, {"page": "1957", "response": ["* March 7 \u2013 Wyndham Lewis, English painter (b. 1882)"]}]}}
