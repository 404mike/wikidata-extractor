Robert Burns paid tribute to her as \"a votary of the Muses\".Riddel was born Maria Woodley, daughter of a Governor of the Leeward Islands. In 1791, she married her first husband Walter Riddell. The couple settled in an estate in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. Her husband was brother to a patron of Robert Burns. Burns became a close friend of Maria, and wrote love songs for her. From 1794 to 1795, she and Burns quarrelled over his behavior towards her when drunk. \nFollowing the death of her first husband, Riddell married the Welsh landowner Phillips Lloyd Fletcher. She was buried in a family vault located in Chester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1808 in literature", "response": ["*Maria Riddell \u2013 West Indies-born poet, naturalist and travel writer (born 1772)"]}, {"page": "1772 in literature", "response": ["*unknown date \u2013 Maria Riddell, West Indies-born poet, naturalist and travel writer resident in Scotland (died 1808)"]}, {"page": "1792 in literature", "response": ["*Maria Riddell \u2013 Voyage to the Madeira and Leeward and Caribbean Isles, with Sketches of the Natural History of these Islands"]}, {"page": "Wanlockhead", "response": ["Robert Burns and an associate, Thomas Sloan, visited Wanlockhead in the winter of 1789\u201390.

They had to wait their turn and took shelter at Ramage's Inn, where Burns wrote a poem entitled Pegasus at Wanlockhead. Pegasus was the name of Burns' horse. Burns also visited Wanlockhead in January 1792 to explore the lead mines. He was accompanied by Maria Riddell, the sister of Robert Riddell of Friar's Carse. They breakfasted at Sanquhar and then took a poste-chaise to the mines. They went a considerable distance into the mines, braving the dark, wet and cramped conditions at first; however they had to turn back as Burns found the poor air very distressing. Burns did not record this visit, but Maria included the details in a letter."]}, {"page": "Ann Park", "response": ["One other tradition is that Anna actually died whilst giving birth to Elizabeth or soon after,Greenshields, p.25 and Maria Riddell did write that Jean Armour was a generous person for having taken in an illegitimate child \"... who had lost her mother.\"Greenshields. p.38 She certainly vanishes from history in the early 1790s.", "A letter of 1792 to Maria Riddell has led to speculation that she had been asked by Burns to carry out a task regarding Elizabeth, Ann's daughter.Mackay, Page 497"]}, {"page": "Brow, Dumfries and Galloway", "response": ["Whilst at Brow he wrote several letters, including one on 12 July to George Thomson requesting \u00a35 and one to James Burness in Montrose for \u00a310.

He also wrote on 10 July two, his first and his last letters ever written by him to his father-in-law, seeking help for his wife in the final stages of her pregnancy from her mother Mrs Mary Armour. A letter to his wife was unsurprisingly positive given Jean's Armours advanced state of pregnancy. To his brother Gilbert he wrote hinting at money troubles and despairing of his health.Mackay, Page 621 Burns also stated that he intended to continue taking the treatment for the whole summer whilst \"staying at a friend's house\", presumably an offer made by Maria Riddell.The Romantic Letters of Robert Burns Retrieved : 2014-01-12", "During this stay, on 5 July, Maria Riddell sent her carriage to collect him so that he could dine with her at Lochmaben.
