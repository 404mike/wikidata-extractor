Three consecutive draws in late March and early April allowed Torquay to close the gap to just one point, with Ipswich five points adrift. Over Easter 1957, Colchester lost three consecutive away games at Millwall, Walsall and Swindon Town, but won their final game of the season 2\u20130 against Watford to put them back at the top of the table, but both Ipswich and Torquay's final matches were 24 hours later. Both sides won their final games, with Colchester slipping to third position in the table and Ipswich were promoted as champions, level on points with Torquay but with a better goal average, while they finished one point ahead of Colchester. Colchester played the entire season unbeaten at Layer Road.", "|Chic Milligan||CB||||Ardrossan||||0||0|| Ardrossan Winton Rovers||18 August 1956||\u00a31,000", "|Chic Milligan", "|align=\"left\"|Chic Milligan", "|Chic Milligan"]}, {"page": "Charles Campbell Milligan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chic Milligan "]}, {"page": "Charles Milligan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chic Milligan "]}, {"page": "Milligan (surname)", "response": ["* Chic Milligan (Charles Campbell Milligan; born 1930), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
