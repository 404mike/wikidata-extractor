Having made only five appearances for York, Mooney was loaned to Conference Premier club Alfreton Town for the rest of the season. York entered their home match against Stevenage with the visitors on a five-match unbeaten run, and lost 2\u20130 with the away team scoring in each half. Striker Emile Sinclair was signed on a one-and-a-half-year contract after having his contract at Northampton cancelled, where he had fallen down the pecking order. Walsall's Mal Benning was signed on a one-month loan to provide competition for Ilesanmi at left-back. Sinclair scored in the 70th minute of his debut against Burton with a close range finish, before the away team equalised late in the match through Adam McGurk.

Coulson scored soon after the second half began when his deep cross dropped into the far corner of the goal, and Hyde finished the scoring in the 55th minute when diverting Fletcher's shot from inside the six-yard box. York went behind away to AFC Wimbledon when Deji Oshilaja scored a header in the 19th minute, before Hyde scored an equaliser after goalkeeper Joe McDonnell dropped Sinclair's cross in the 43rd minute. However, Jack Smith scored the winning goal for the home team with a volley in the 90th minute, meaning the match ended in a 2\u20131 win for AFC Wimbledon. Shaq Coulthirst, who scored Southend's winning goal against York in January, joined on loan from Tottenham Hotspur for the rest of the season, after Fletcher was ruled out for six weeks with a hamstring injury. York drew 0\u20130 at home to relegation rivals Carlisle, and the team's best chances came in the 74th minute when Coulson and Sinclair had shots cleared off the line. Having made nine appearances for York, Benning was recalled by Walsall due to an injury to Andy Taylor.
