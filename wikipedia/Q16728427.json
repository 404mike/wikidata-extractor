He took charge of his 800th competitive match in August 2011. On transfer deadline day, Pulis signed Cameron Jerome from Birmingham City as well as Tottenham Hotspur duo Peter Crouch and Wilson Palacios; Crouch, at a fee of \u00a310\u00a0million, broke the club's transfer record for the fourth successive season. In the group stages of the Europa League, Stoke were drawn against Be\u015fikta\u015f, Dynamo Kyiv and Maccabi Tel Aviv, and after a 1\u20131 draw against Kyiv in December, Stoke qualified for the knock-out stages. Pulis described the achievement as a \"milestone\" in the club's history. Stoke were handed a glamour tie against Spanish giants Valencia in the round of 32. He reached 400 matches as Stoke manager in January 2012. Stoke lost both legs against Valencia 1\u20130 and exited the Europa League. In the second leg in Valencia, Stoke took a largely reserve side and named just four substitutes which included academy captain Lucas Dawson. This attracted much criticism of Pulis by supporters but he defended his choice.
