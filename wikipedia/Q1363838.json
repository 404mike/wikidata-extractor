He wrote fiction, biography, and autobiography. During his stay in China, he studied Chinese language, traditional drama, and poetry, some of which he translated.\nHe was born near Florence, Italy, to a prominent Anglo-Italian family. At Eton College, he was a founding member of the Eton Arts Society before going up to Oxford to read Modern Greats at Christ Church. He co-founded the avant garde magazine The Oxford Broom and mixed with many intellectual and literary figures of the age, including Evelyn Waugh, who based the character of Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited partly on him. Between the wars, Acton lived in Paris, London, and Florence, proving most successful as an historian, his magnum opus being a 3-volume study of the Medicis and the Bourbons.\nAfter serving as an RAF liaison officer in the Mediterranean, he returned to Florence, restoring his childhood home, Villa La Pietra, to its earlier glory. Acton was knighted in 1974 and died in Florence, leaving La Pietra to New York University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Harold Acton (1904\u20131994, E/It)"]}, {"page": "Florence", "response": ["* Harold Acton, author and aesthete"]}, {"page": "July 5", "response": ["*1904 \u2013 Harold Acton, English scholar and author (d. 1994)"]}, {"page": "1904", "response": ["** Harold Acton, British writer, scholar, and aesthete (died 1994)"]}, {"page": "House of Medici", "response": ["Cosimo's elder son, Ferdinando, was not yet of legal maturity to succeed him, thus Maria Maddalena and his grandmother, Christina of Lorraine, acted as regents.

Acton and Howard rapidly became the centre of an avant-garde circle known as the Hypocrites' Club (Waugh was the secretary of the club), whose artistic, social and homosexual values Waugh adopted enthusiastically;Stannard, Vol. I pp. 83\u201385 he later wrote: \"It was the stamping ground of half my Oxford life\".Waugh, A Little Learning, pp. 179\u201381 He began drinking heavily, and embarked on the first of several homosexual relationships, the most lasting of which were with Hugh Lygon (the inspiration for the future  Lord Sebastian Flyte), Richard Pares and Alastair Graham.Stannard, Vol. I p. 90 He continued to write reviews and short stories for the university journals, and developed a reputation as a talented graphic artist, but formal study largely ceased. This neglect led to a bitter feud between Waugh and his history tutor, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, dean (and later principal) of Hertford College. When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways, Waugh responded in a manner which, he admitted later, was \"fatuously haughty\";Waugh, \"A Little Learning\", p. 175 from then on, relations between the two descended into mutual hatred.Stannard, Vol. I pp. 76\u201377 Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell's name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous, ignominious or odious minor characters.Sykes, p. 45", "Waugh maintained his reputation in 1942, with Put Out More Flags, which sold well despite wartime restrictions on paper and printing.Stannard, Vol. II pp. 72\u201373 Its public reception, however, did not compare with that accorded to Brideshead Revisited three years later, on both sides of the Atlantic. Brideshead's selection as the American Book of the Month swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain, which was affected by paper shortages.Stannard, Vol. II p. 148 Despite the public's enthusiasm, critical opinion was split. Brideshead's Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh's earlier novels with warm praise. Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by, among others, Conor Cruise O'Brien who, in the Irish literary magazine The Bell, wrote of Waugh's \"almost mystical veneration\" for the upper classes.Conor Cruise O'Brien in \"The Pieties of Evelyn Waugh\", reprinted in Stannard: Evelyn Waugh: The Critical Heritage, pp. 255\u201363. (O'Brien used the pen-name \"Donat Donnelly\").Patey, pp. 262\u201363 Fellow writer Rose Macaulay believed that Waugh's genius had been adversely affected by the intrusion of his right-wing partisan alter ego and that he had lost his detachment: \"In art so naturally ironic and detached as his, this is a serious loss\".Carpenter (ed.), p. 288 Conversely, the book was praised by Yorke, Graham Greene and, in glowing terms, by Harold Acton who was particularly impressed by its evocation of 1920s Oxford.Hastings, p. 492 In 1959, at the request of publishers Chapman and Hall and in some deference to his critics, Waugh revised the book and wrote in a preface: \"I have modified the grosser passages but not obliterated them because they are an essential part of the book\".From Waugh's preface to the  revised edition, published by Chapman and Hall, 1960."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Harold Acton (1904\u20131994), English writer, scholar and dilettante"]}, {"page": "Nancy Mitford", "response": ["Within a month of Erskine's departure, Mitford announced her engagement to Peter Rodd, the second son of Sir Rennell Rodd, a diplomat and politician who was ennobled that year as Baron Rennell.

The same year The Sunday Times asked her to contribute a regular column, which she did for four years. The busy period in her writing life continued in 1951 with her third postwar novel, The Blessing, another semi-autobiographical romance this time set in Paris, in which an aristocratic young Englishwoman is married to a libidinous French marquis. Harold Acton deems it her most accomplished novel, \"permeated with her joyous love of France\".Acton, p. 85 This time Waugh (to whom the book was dedicated) had no criticism; he found the book \"admirable, deliciously funny, consistent and complete, by far the best of your writings\".Amory (ed.), p. 346"]}, {"page": "Diana Mitford", "response": ["She wrote the foreword and introduction of Nancy Mitford: A Memoir by Harold Acton.

Jay Oliva", "response": ["Through Oliva's initiative, NYU was the founding member of the League of World Universities, established in 1991, whose membership now represents nearly fifty of the world's great urban universities. La Pietra, a cluster of five villas in Tuscany bequeathed to NYU by the late Sir Harold Acton, and the Lillian Vernon Center for International Affairs at Washington Square, serve as hubs for international activities that draw scholars and students from around the world. Oliva also created the \"NYU Speaking Freely\" program to provide students with opportunities for language learning outside the classroom.  In recognition of this work, he received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award in 2001 from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.  He served as President of New York University from 1991 until May 16, 2002. Under his leadership the school's fund-raising efforts soared, increasing from approximately $100 million annually in 1991 to more the $350 million in 2001. In 1995 Oliva oversaw the completion of what was at that time the first billion-dollar campaign undertaken by an American university. Launched in 1985 under Oliva\u2019s predecessor, John Brademas, the campaign was successfully completed five years ahead of schedule. He signed the first contract between a private university and a graduate assistant labor union, the Graduate Student Organizing Committee of Local 2110/United Auto Workers.

A gardening enthusiast, she devoted long hours to the flowers and shrubs of her residence. A regular guest of the British Consulate, she also frequented the intellectuals who, like Harold Acton, had settled in the region of Florence. From 1968 to 1973, Helen had a romantic relationship with the twice-widower King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, with whom she shared a love of art and plants.
