After featuring for the club eight times during the 2014\u201315 season, recently released Rotherham United defender Richard Brindley held talks with Colchester with a view to joining the club on a permanent basis. It was then announced on 15 May that club captain Magnus Okuonghae would not be offered a new deal to remain with the club when his deal expired. Okuonghae, who had spent six years with the U's, played 215 games for the club, but a ruptured achilles tendon early in the previous campaign brought a premature end to his season. Tony Humes described Okuonghae as \"an excellent servant to the club\". Also leaving the Colchester Community Stadium was Colchester United influential sports scientist Dave Carolan, who headed to Birmingham City to take up a role as the head of sports science for the Championship club. Meanwhile, winger Dion Sembie-Ferris, who made his first-team debut against Cardiff City in the FA Cup third round last season, committed his future to the club by signing a new three-year deal.", "Colchester continued their winless run in the league on 16 January. With the U's having not registered a win in League One in three months, they welcomed Sheffield United to the Community Stadium, and buoyed by their FA Cup victory over Charlton a week prior, Colchester looked to capitalise on this and push on with their faltering league season. The Blades opened the scoring on 20-minutes through Billy Sharp, who had scored in the reverse fixture earlier in the campaign. After the break, the U's equalised when Tom Eastman headed in Marvin Sordell's cross. A point looked to be on the cards for Colchester, but for Chris Basham, who scored a 91st-minute winner for the away side. On 18 January, the U's saw one arrival and one exit. Incoming was former West Ham loanee Elliot Lee, who joined for his second spell with the club until the end of the season. Leaving by mutual consent was Byron Lawrence, who after just one first-team appearance left the club by mutual consent. The following day, Fleetwood Town were the visitors in a 1\u20131 draw. Alex Gilbey scored the opening goal on 38 minutes, before Eggert J\u00f3nsson equalised on the hour mark. The scores remained, and Colchester moved up to 22nd in the League One table, five points from Fleetwood in 20th position and safety.", "| Byron Lawrence", "| Byron Lawrence"]}]}}
