His medium was predominately pastel chalk crayon on paper. Many of Lock's pastel portraits were executed on \"dark paper\" so that the subject's faces often came out relatively dark-skinned, an unusual technique. A few of his landscapes were lithographed, notably of Niagara Falls and of The Thousand Islands, while others were in pencil, ink and in watercolor. Citations of Lock and his artwork are found in Early Printers and Engravers in Canada by J. Russel Harper, and in The Collector's Dictionary of Canadian Artists at Auction by Anthony R. Westbridge and Diana L. Bodnar.F. W. Lock's works can be found in the British Museum, The National Gallery, and National Portrait Gallery, London, England; the McCord Museum, National Gallery of Canada, Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QC; the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Ontario; the Brockville Museum, Brockville, Ontario; the Brome County Historical Society Museum, Knowlton, Quebec, Canada; and the Harvard/Fogg Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick William Lock (artist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick William Lock"]}]}}
