Death had originally joined West Ham as an apprentice in 1967 but by 1969 found his opportunities for first team football blocked by Ferguson and Peter Grotier."]}, {"page": "Tommy Jenkins", "response": ["He made his debut for Southampton at home to Nottingham Forest on 13 December 1969, where he took the place of long-time club servant, John Sydenham, on the left-wing. At his best, Jenkins was a high-class winger with great speed, dazzling trickery and the ability to beat several defenders in one run, but would exasperate his fans by dribbling himself into trouble rather than release the ball to a teammate. He was never a prolific goal-scorer, but one memorable moment came on 31 August 1970 at Upton Park, where his run took him past four West Ham players before shooting past Hammers' goalkeeper Peter Grotier. He never realised his full potential at Southampton and was sold to Swindon Town in November 1972, having made a total of 96 appearances for Southampton, scoring six goals."]}]}}
