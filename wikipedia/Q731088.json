He is notable for having scored Liverpool's first ever goal, in a friendly against Rotherham Town on 1 September 1892, which Liverpool won 7\u20131.\nHe started his career with Third Lanark before he was signed by newly formed Liverpool in 1892. As well as scoring their first ever goal, McVean was also Liverpool's captain for their first ever competitive match, in the Lancashire League against Higher Walton on 3 September 1892. Walton did not arrive until forty-five minutes after the scheduled kick-off time, and Liverpool won 8\u20130.\nWhen Liverpool were admitted to the Football League a year later, it was McVean who scored their first ever goal in the League, in a 2\u20130 win away from home over Middlesbrough Ironopolis on 2 September 1893. He also scored twice in Liverpool's first ever victory over top flight opposition when Preston North End were beaten 3\u20132 in a classic FA cup upset in 1894.In all McVean made 89 league appearances for the Reds, forty-three of them in the top division where he scored eight goals in four seasons from 1893 until 1897 when he spent the end of his fourth, and final league season with Burnley where he made just four appearances.\nMcVean has the unusual distinction of having experienced promotion or relegation in each of his four seasons in England; Liverpool 1894 \u2013 promoted, 1895 \u2013 relegated, 1896 \u2013 promoted, Burnley, 1897 \u2013 relegated.\nHe left English league football for his native Scotland where he joined Dundee. He also had spells with Bedminster and Clydebank.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*First player to score for Liverpool: Malcolm McVean (against Rotherham Town, 1 September 1892)."]}, {"page": "John McKenna", "response": ["McKenna met the founder of Liverpool Football Club John Houlding, who invited him to Anfield to watch his Everton team play.

This involved a knockout match with the bottom team in the First Division, Newton Heath (later renamed Manchester United). Liverpool won, and took their place in the First Division. Their stay in the division lasted only a season, as they finished in bottom position, with seven wins from thirty matches.
