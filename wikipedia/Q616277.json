He then performed his National Service with the Royal Air Force before returning to Manchester United in 1948 to begin his administrative career overseeing the club's reserve team. He retained ambitions as a player and was a regular in the club's 'A' and 'B' junior sides, as well as making the odd reserve team appearance. He played in \"every position except outside left\", but preferred a defensive role as either a full-back or a centre-half; however, it was as a goalkeeper that he made his first-team debut, just three weeks before his 25th birthday. With first-team goalkeepers Jack Crompton, Ray Wood and Reg Allen all unavailable due to injury and illness, Olive was picked to play in goal away to Newcastle United on 11 April 1953, helping Manchester United to a 2\u20131 win. He made one more appearance in senior football, a 2\u20132 draw at home to West Bromwich Albion the following week, before returning to the 'A' team as a left-back."]}, {"page": "Reginald Allen", "response": ["* Reg Allen (1919\u20131976), English football (soccer) goalkeeper", "* Reg Allen (set decorator) (1917\u20131989)"]}, {"page": "1951\u201352 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Reg Allen"]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Reg Allen"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["A notable acquisition by the club during this season was 18-year-old goalkeeper Ray Wood, who was signed from Darlington as manager Matt Busby looked to find a younger goalkeeper to provide competition for Jack Crompton and Reg Allen for the 1950s."]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Reg Allen"]}]}}
