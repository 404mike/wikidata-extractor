He wrote extensively on the Hellenistic world, particularly on Alexander the Great's empire and its successor states.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Euthydemus I", "response": ["Euthydemus was a Greek from one of the Magnesias in Ionia, though it is uncertain from which one (Magnesia on the Maeander or Magnesia ad Sipylum) and he was the father of Demetrius I, according to Strabo and Polybius.Strabo, Geography 11.11.1Polybius 11.34 Siege of Bactra William Woodthorpe Tarn proposed that Euthydemus was the son of a Greek general called Antimachus or Apollodotus, born c. 295 BC, whom he considered to be the son of Sophytes, and that he married a sister of the Greco-Bactrian king Diodotus II. However, there is no explicit evidence for these links or even for the existence of the sister of Diodotos and Tarn's genealogical hypotheses are no longer generally accepted."]}, {"page": "Diodotus I", "response": ["The only attested relative of Diodotus I is his son and successor, Diodotus II. William Woodthorpe Tarn interpreted later Bactrian coinage as indicating that Diodotos had a daughter who married Euthydemus, was involved in the assassination of Diodotus and usurpation of the throne, and then became Queen regent until her son, Demetrius I ascended to the throne. There is no explicit evidence for this daughter's existence and the speculative nature of Tarn's genealogical reconstructions has been criticised in subsequent scholarship."]}, {"page": "1934 in literature", "response": ["*William Woodthorpe Tarn \u2013 The Treasure of the Isle of Mist"]}, {"page": "Hellenistic period", "response": ["However, William Woodthorpe Tarn, between World War\u00a0I and World War\u00a0II and the heyday of the League of Nations, focused on the issues of racial and cultural confrontation and the nature of colonial rule. Michael Rostovtzeff, who fled the Russian Revolution, concentrated predominantly on the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie in areas of Greek rule. Arnaldo Momigliano, an Italian Jew who wrote before and after the Second World War, studied the problem of mutual understanding between races in the conquered areas. Moses Hadas portrayed an optimistic picture of synthesis of culture from the perspective of the 1950s, while Frank William Walbank in the 1960s and 1970s had a materialistic approach to the Hellenistic period, focusing mainly on class relations. Recently, however, papyrologist C. Pr\u00e9aux has concentrated predominantly on the economic system, interactions between kings and cities, and provides a generally pessimistic view on the period. Peter Green, on the other hand, writes from the point of view of late-20th-century liberalism, his focus being on individualism, the breakdown of convention, experiments, and a postmodern disillusionment with all institutions and political processes."]}, {"page": "Euthydemia", "response": ["Euthymedia or Euthydemia () was the ancient city of Sagala belonging to the Bactrian Dynasty, now located in modern-day Sialkot, Pakistan. The British classical scholar William Woodthorpe Tarn, suggested that \"Euthydemia\" was never assigned as a new name for ancient Sagala, and that the name was actually Euthymedeia. The altered name was suggested to have been a 1738 alteration made by historian T Beyer. The city was mentioned by Ptolemy in his 1st century BCE work, Geography."]}, {"page": "Antimachus I", "response": ["William Woodthorpe Tarn and numismatist Robert Senior place Antimachus as a member of the Euthydemid dynasty and probably as a son of Euthydemus and brother of Demetrius. Other historians, like A.K. Narain, mark him as independent of Euthydemid authority, and probably a scion of some relation to the Diodotid dynasty. He was king of an area covering parts of Bactria and probably also Arachosia in southern Afghanistan (see \"Coins of Antimachus I,\" below). Antimachus I was either defeated during his resistance to the usurper Eucratides, or his main territory was absorbed by the latter upon his death."]}, {"page": "Category talk:English historians", "response": ["List of all pages in category English historians retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.
