He and his family sailed on the SS United States, arriving at Southampton from New York on 24 July 1956.UK and Ireland, Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878-1960 During his period at the NPL he successfully obtained additional staff and facilities for the Laboratory, to make up for the relative lack of investment since the war. He appointed John Pople to head up a new basics physics division, who was joined by David Whiffen, Keith McLauchlan, and Ray Freeman who together developed the use of nuclear magnetic resonance."]}, {"page": "Insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer", "response": ["Insensitive nuclei enhancement by polarization transfer (INEPT) is a signal enhancement method used in NMR spectroscopy. It involves the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from spins with large Boltzmann population differences to nuclear spins of interest with lower Boltzmann population differences.  INEPT uses J-coupling for the polarization transfer in contrast to Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), which arises from dipolar cross-relaxation. This method of signal enhancement was introduced by Ray Freeman in 1979. Due to its usefulness in signal enhancement, pulse sequences used in heteronuclear NMR experiments often contain blocks of INEPT or INEPT-like sequences.", "The sensitivity can be enhanced artificially by increasing the Boltzmann factors. One method may be through NOE; for example, for 13C signal, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved three-fold when the attached protons are saturated.  However, for NOE, a negative value of K, the ratio of gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclei, may result in a reduction in signal intensity. Since15N has a negative gyromagnetic ratio, the observed 15N signal can be near zero if the dipolar relaxation has to compete with other mechanisms. Alternative methods are therefore necessary for nuclei with a negative gyromagnetic ratio. One such method using the INEPT pulse sequence was proposed by Ray Freeman in 1979 and has become widely adopted."]}, {"page": "Ad Bax", "response": ["Bax was born in the Netherlands. He studied at Delft University of Technology where he got his engineer's degree (Ir. degree) in 1978, and Ph.D. degree in applied physics in 1981, after spending considerable time working with Ray Freeman at Oxford University. He worked as a postdoc with Gary Maciel at Colorado State University, before joining the NIH's Laboratory of Chemical Physics in 1983. In 1994 he became correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is currently the Chief of the Section on Biophysical NMR Spectroscopy at NIH. In 2002 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in the section on Biophysics and computational biology and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
