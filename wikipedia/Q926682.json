Gatti's article was criticized by many in the literary world as a violation of privacy, though Gatti contends that \"by announcing that she would lie on occasion, Ferrante has in a way relinquished her right to disappear behind her books and let them live and grow while their author remained unknown. Indeed, she and her publisher seemed to have fed public interest in her true identity.\" British novelist Matt Haig tweeted, \"Think the pursuit to discover the 'real' Elena Ferrante is a disgrace and also pointless. A writer's truest self is the books they write.\" The writer Jeanette Winterson, in a Guardian article, denounced Gatti's investigations as malicious and sexist, saying \"At the bottom of this so-called investigation into Ferrante's identity is an obsessional outrage at the success of a writer \u2013 female \u2013 who decided to write, publish and promote her books on her own terms.\" She went on to say that the desire to uncover Ferrante's identity constitutes an act of sexism in itself, and that \"Italy is still a Catholic country with strong patriarchial attitudes towards women.\" Others responding to Gatti's article suggested that knowledge of Ferrante's biography is indeed relevant."]}, {"page": "List of World Book Day books", "response": ["*Evie in the Jungle written by Matt Haig, illustrated by Emily Gravett (Canongate)"]}, {"page": "The Dead Fathers Club", "response": ["The Dead Fathers Club is a 2006 novel by Matt Haig.
