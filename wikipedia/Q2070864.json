Booth, who joined Hibernian aged 10, played for the youth team that won a league and cup double in 2009. After loan spells with Arbroath and Brechin City in 2010, he broke into the Hibernian first team in 2011. He was selected less frequently during 2012 and was loaned to Livingston for the 2012\u201313 season and then to Raith Rovers the following season. Booth moved to Partick Thistle in January 2015, initially on loan. After three years at Firhill he signed for Dundee United in May 2018, leaving the club in August 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "East Lothian", "response": ["*Callum Booth, professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Partick Thistle F.C.", "response": ["The 2015\u201316 Scottish Premiership season saw Thistle secure long-term contracts for many of their key players, including Kris Doolan, Callum Booth, Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u010cern\u00fd and Mustapha Dumbuya.", "In the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership, Thistle finished in 11th position, narrowly avoiding 12th place with Ross County being automatically relegated. Thistle subsequently went into the Scottish Premiership play-offs against Livingston, who had finished second in the Scottish Championship in their first season of returning to the league. On 17 May 2018, Thistle lost the first leg 2\u20131 away at Almondvale Stadium, with Kris Doolan getting Thistle's goal. Livingston then came to face Thistle at Firhill on 20 May 2018. Livingston won the away leg 0\u20131 after Keaghan Jacobs scored in the 46th minute. Thistle were relegated to the Scottish Championship after a stay in the top flight of five years. Subsequently, speculation surrounded whether or not Archibald would remain as Thistle's manager. On 24 May, Thistle announced on their website Archibald would remain as Partick Thistle's manager going into the Championship next season. As a result of Thistle's poor season, a number of players were not offered a new contract by the club including captain Abdul Osman, Callum Booth, Steven Lawless, Mustapha Dumbuya, Paul McGinn and Ryan Scully. Transfer listed players were Adam Barton, Niall Keown and Miles Storey. Australian midfielder Ryan Edwards triggered a relegation contract clause, allowing him to leave the club immediately. After a poor start to their 2018\u201319 Scottish Championship season, Archibald was sacked as manager on 6 October 2018 following a 2\u20130 loss to Ross County, leaving Thistle 8th in the Championship."]}, {"page": "1991 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Callum Booth, Professional Footballer"]}, {"page": "Knox Academy", "response": ["*Callum Booth, professional footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Premier League monthly award winners", "response": ["| Callum Booth (Hibernian)"]}, {"page": "Scottish Football League monthly awards", "response": ["|  Callum Booth"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Scottish Youth Cup", "response": ["|LB || || Callum Booth"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| Callum Booth"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Scottish Premier League", "response": ["| Callum Booth"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| Callum Booth"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Livingston F.C. season", "response": ["||| DF|| Callum Booth", "| Callum Booth"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Greenock Morton F.C. season", "response": ["|Iain Russell    Keaghan Jacobs   Craig Barr   Callum Booth "]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| Callum Booth"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Greenock Morton F.C. season", "response": ["|Callum Booth   Greig Spence  "]}]}}
