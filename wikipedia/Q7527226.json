A Conservative Member of Parliament from 1940, he became Minister of Health in 1943. During his time in power he was appointed Special Commissioner for those made homeless by the London Blitz and was involved with the production of the Beveridge Report.The details of the report proposed a comprehensive free healthcare system, this led to the white paper 'A National Health Service', published in 1944, suggesting the creation of such a service, which did not include the nationalisation of hospitals. Such a policy was later implemented by the Labour Party through the creation of the National Health Service which differed to the proposals suggested by Willink. At the time he claimed the nationalisation of voluntary hospitals \"will destroy so much in this country that we value\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
