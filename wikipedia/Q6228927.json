He took only two wickets, both on debut against Warwickshire in 1900, but both victims were notable players: future Warwickshire captain Tom Fishwick and Test cricketer Willie Quaife. His other match was against Surrey almost seven years later, but this was a game in which he did not bowl at all.\nHe was born in Peopleton, Worcestershire; he died in Walsall, then Staffordshire at the age of 75.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peopleton", "response": ["* John Days, Worcestershire cricketer in the 1900s, was born in Peopleton."]}, {"page": "Days, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Days"]}]}}
