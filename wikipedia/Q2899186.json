On this occasion there were no problems and the ground successfully hosted an international match on 7 March 1891. Although no official attendance figures were taken, the South Wales Daily News stated 'an immense concourse of people assembled on the park; in fact it was the largest that had ever been witnessed at a football match in the tin plate town'.Godwin (1984), pg 30. Two years later, Stradey Park was the final venue of the 1893 Home Nations Championship, hosting Wales against Ireland. Wales, under the captaincy of Welsh rugby legend Arthur Gould, beat the Irish team by a single try scored by Gould's brother, Bert Gould. The score not only gave Wales the win but also saw Wales lift the Triple Crown for the very first time in the country's history.

In a reversal of fortunes from the previous season, Wales managed to win all three matches, lifting the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. Biggs played an important role during the Triple Crown winning season, scoring two tries, one each in the games against England and Scotland.

It was a terrible campaign for the Welsh squad, losing all three games of the tournament, though McCutcheon did not make the away trip to Lansdowne Road to face Ireland. During the 1893 Championship McCutcheon was given his first full campaign, playing in all three games. In a complete turn around from the prior season, Wales won all their matches lifting the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. In the second game of the tournament, in a match away to Scotland, McCutcheon scored the only international points of his career with one of three tries from the Welsh three-quarters, the other two tries coming from Bert Gould and Norman Biggs.Smith (1980), pg 88. McCutcheon played just one more international game for Wales in the opener of the 1884 Home Nations Championship, at Birckenhead to England.
