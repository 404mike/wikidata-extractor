Abrams\u00b4s directed Star Wars IX: Rise of Skywalker was so controversial, that the film (and its tie-ins), kept generating negative or controversial headlines in regards to the film's plot-holes for almost 10 months after its release. While contrasting how most of the other Star Wars projects released during that time span were better received. Including Dave Filoni projects like The Mandalorian and the finale of The Clone Wars animated series. Though articles criticizing the attempts to fix the plot-holes existed even almost 2 year after.https://screenrant.com/star-wars-book-rise-skywalker-plot-holes-explained/https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/star-wars-finally-explains-the-worst-part-of-rise-of-skywalkerhttps://screenrant.com/star-wars-rise-skywalker-palpatine-clone-rey-father-live/ Specially controversial was a scene in which Rey hears some Jedi voices in her head before killing Darth Sidious. While attempting to defend the theatrical cut's \"conscious choice\" of not showing ghosts, and instead only showing the voices, the VFX-editor Roger Guyett said he perceived the idea of hearing them, made them \"almost more powerful than the idea of actually visually seeing them\". He also said, \"What I liked about that idea as it developed, was that you feel like you're with Rey and you're inside her head\" (very clearly noting that Rey hears the voices inside of her head). The controversy led to fan-edits adding the Force ghosts with footage from the previous films. The scene also got inadvertently compared to the beginning of the movie, which establishes Darth Sidious has the new Force ability of imitating voices in people's heads, by imitating Snoke and Darth Vader in Kylo Ren's head, this led to some viewers to interpret Palpatine was all of the voices, and that the evil character won the final battle of the film. Screenrant noted that Darth Sidious should have been able to stop shooting the deflected lighting that was killing him, since his former apprentice Count Dooku was able in Attack of the Clones, and that Darth Sidious should have been aware of the dangers of a lightsaber deflecting his Force lighting back at him, due to it being how Mace Windu deformed his face in Revenge of the Sith.https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a32627644/star-wars-sith-dagger-plot-hole-rise-of-skywalker/ In addition to the many perceived plot-holes on that scene, the movie is perceived to also have many others outside of it, among them is Darth Sidious return to life (which is never explained on-screen), Rey using Luke Skywalker's X-wing (which was clearly broken in the previous film), and also on the fact that Tie Fighters had no hyperdrives on the previous Original Trilogy films. Thus Kylo Ren could never had reached the fight with Darth Sidious on time, because Rey had taken away his ship.https://gizmodo.com/20-questions-we-have-after-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywa-1840559128  Two Forbes writers criticized the attempts at explaining away the plot-holes of the movie. According to IGN, the plot points and unanswered questions in The Rise of Skywalker were addressed by tie-in books and comics that would require fans a total of $150, that would be better spent on Baby Yoda merchandise. In addition to conspiracy theories about the film's production and perceived failures on Reddit, another plot related popular fan theory supported by website Esquire, spawned due to the film's plot-holes, and in regard to the same previously mentioned scene of the \"ghosts\". The fan theory claims that the villain Darth Sidious won at the end of the last film and possesses Rey's body by making her kill him (which he stated, as his evil plan in the film). Due to a plot-hole that leaves open ended that Darth Sidious was possibly imitating \"the voices of the Jedi that Rey hears in her head\", before defeating Darth Sidious. Since the scene inadvertently got compared to the beginning of the movie, which establishes Darth Sidious has the new Force ability of imitating voices in people's heads, when Darth Sidious imitates Snoke and Darth Vader in Kylo Ren's head. Esquire noted the fan theory, states that in his initial meeting with Kylo Ren, Darth Sidious reveals that he has the ability to imitate voices into people's heads, by imitating the voices of Darth Vader and Snoke. This creates a plot-hole were some people perceive all of the Jedi voices that Rey hears could be perceived as mere imitations by Darth Sidious done in Rey's head, by using the same ability Darth Sidious had revealed he had earlier in the film. Since those voices also help Rey to kill Darth Sidious, something that the former Emperor stated he wanted Rey to do in order to merge his soul into her body (while the film does not mention the possibility of the voices being imitations by Darth Sidious, noting in the film prevents the possibility). The film makes it impossible to determine if the voices were truly the past Jedi or imitations by Darth Sidious. Without mentioning the unconfirmed origin of the voices, some websites like Digital Spy argue that Darth Sidious death due to Rey deflecting Darth Sidious own Force lighting bolt back at him, could make the cause of death a suicide (thus preventing Darth Sidious from merging his soul to her body). However, Esquire argued that it could still count as Rey murdering him (which would mean Darth Sidious won and fulfilled his plan of merging his soul into Rey's body, and that even if it was not the original intention, it could be very easily rewritten such). Time called the plot point \"unclear\". Website Syfy.com reviewed the theory, stating that it seemed plausible except nothing Rey does later suggest that Rey got possessed by Darth Sidious, that Disney would not permit \"the devil to win\", and that the theory attempts to retcon the events of the film instead of predicting something that could happen later or move the narrative forward. However it called the fan-theory somewhat of a genuine attempt at \"narrative salvation\" by filling the narrative voids left by the Rise of Skywalker, which it described as \"half-baked and ridden with actual plot-holes\". What heavily supports the Darth Sidious imitations and victory interpretation, and makes the presence of some of those Force ghosts confusing, is that it contradicts previous films less, due to another plot-hole with the previous films. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith established that the ability to become a Force ghost required special training in life. Since Qui-jon only revealed the ability to return as a Force ghost along the required training, long after the death of various of those voices (like Mace Windu). As noted by website Screenrant, the return as a Force ghost of some of those voices clearly contradicts how Force ghosts worked in the previous films, and brings into question where were those voices during the events of the Original Trilogy (such plot-hole would not exist if the voices were imitations by Darth Sidious, which arguably would be more consistent to the previous films). Qui-jon is shown starting the training of Yoda to become a Force ghost, which required a complicated set of special trials, in the Season 6 finale of The Clone Wars animated series. According to website Gizmodo, the technique took years to learn, and no one knew the ability other than the Force priestesses that originally taught the technique to Qui-jon. The only characters to learn the technique from Qui-jon were Yoda, Obi-wan, and it is assumed Luke learned it from them. While Anakin was the only one who naturally achieved it without training. Many Reddit conspiracy theories centering on the production of the film led to false rumors about the existence of multiple director's cuts of the film, including one that supposedly included visual appearances of the (blue colored) ghosts of Obi-wan, Anakin Skywalker, and Yoda, instead of only their voices (the rumor, being completely unrelated to IX: Duel of the Fates). Although it was argued that most fans do not believe in the existence of the alternate cut by Abrams, it is believed they rather supported it as the means towards asking for a better cut of the negatively received film, as well as for a better end towards the franchise. Others, however, saw it as a parody of the movement in which fans lobbied for the Snyder Cut of the poorly received Justice League movie (the Snyder Cut proving to be true somewhat fueled credibility on to those fake Abrams alternate cut conspiracy theories). The petitions asking for a better version of the film started in January 2020, shortly after the film's release. Abrams' friend Greg Grunberg, who had cameos on the films, called the Abrams cut conspiracy fake. Website Vox was negative towards the theories, and called them fake. The Abrams cut conspiracy theories are considered to all be fake, but the unmade and unfilmed script Star Wars: Duel of the Fates by Trevorow has been confirmed as real. The parallel existence of both, led some people to confuse it as part of the conspiracy theories. According to the website The Ringer, the unjustified rumors of a better version of The Rise of Skywalker have persisted for 15 months after the film's release (this not being based on the IX: Duel of the Fates draft which was never filmed at all), mostly fueled by dissatisfaction with the Abrams film that got released, and noted the hashtag asking for another version of the film resurfaced due to the success of the Snyder Cut of Justice League being better than the theatrical cut directed by Joss Whedon whose changes to Zack Snyder's movie, have been very much compared to the ones that Abrams made to the never filmed Colin Trevorow's script of Star Wars IX titled Duel of the Fates, and also that a lot of unreleased footage from the film exists, even if there is no proof it could improve the film at all. A Forbes writer stated conspiracy theories originated due to \"the film being so bad\", and that to a degree the film seemed a typical case of studio interference, comparing it to the Snyder Cut and noting actor Dominic Monaghan, who appeared on the film backed the idea of a \"Special Edition\" of the film. Despite that a never released deleted scene where Kylo Ren called Palpatine a clone is also known to exist, Forbes noted the supposed Abrams cut rumors did not mention it, and stated the deleted scene would not be enough to fix the film. No deleted scenes have been released yet. Another never released deleted scene of Kylo Ren torturing Chewbacca is known to exist. Regardless of their lack of validity those conspiracy theories led fan editors to employ archive footage to visually incorporate the (blue colored) ghosts of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-wan, Luke, and Yoda, into a fan-made version of the scene, which was positively received for its technical execution. Website Inverse argued that the scene, especially on the part featuring Anakin interacting with Rey was better than the scene in the original film, and called for Lucasfilm to include it in a future Special Edition re-release of the film, regardless of the authenticity of the rumors that spawned it. Digital Spy said it was up to fans to choose which they liked more, in regards to seeing the ghosts or only hearing them. Website Techradar  compared the scene to The Phantom Edit fan-edit of the prequel trilogy, saying it was the sequel trilogy's equivalent to that fan-edit.  Abrams however affirmed his dedication not to retroactively release alternate versions of the films, saying, \"I feel like [when] you're done with a thing...that's what it is.\"  Cinema Blend argued it made a world difference and that it would had helped to better bridge the continuity between prequels and sequels. GamesRadar+ noted that it was the fans dissatisfaction with the film that led to such fan edits, of which it added there were multiple fan-edits beyond the most popular one, and that some even toyed with replacing the Jedi voices with Sith voices. Screenrant was positive towards the fan made scene, but noted it should had also included Ahsoka Tano, and that the author was a youtube account named \"Jon H\"."]}, {"page": "Saturn Award for Best Special Effects", "response": ["| Roger Guyett, Stefen Fangmeier, Neil Corbould", "| Robert Legato, Nick Davis, Roger Guyett, John Richardson", "| Roger Guyett, Tim Burke, Bill George, John Richardson", "| John Knoll, Roger Guyett, Rob Coleman, Brian Gernand", "| Roger Guyett, Russell Earl, Pat Tubach, Dan Sudick", "| Roger Guyett, Russell Earl, Paul Kavanagh, Burt Dalton", "| Roger Guyett, Patrick Tubach, Ben Grossmann, Burt Dalton", "| style=\"background:#ddddff\"|Roger Guyett, Patrick Tubach, Neal Scanlan, Chris Corbould", "| Roger Guyett, Grady Cofer, Matthew E.
