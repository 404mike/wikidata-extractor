The two summers in which Woods played for Brighton College were strong ones for the school, of the 23 matches they played, only 2 were lost. Alongside the Woods brothers were a number of other players who would go on to appear in county cricket; George Cotterill and George Wilson both played for Sussex, while Leslie Gay made one Test appearance for England in addition to representing Hampshire and Somerset. Woods topped the bowling averages in both his years at the school; in the first he claimed 59 wickets at an average just over eight, figures which he improved upon during his second year when he took 78 wickets at an average of 7.3. His college reports commented much more favourably on his sporting achievements than his academic ones, praising his batting, bowling and fielding alike.Jiggens (1997), pp19\u201320."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*George Cotterill, footballer, born in Brighton in 1868"]}, {"page": "1860s in association football", "response": ["* 4 April \u2013 George Cotterill (d. 1950), England international in four matches, scoring two goals (1891\u20131893)."]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 in English football", "response": ["For the Irish match, for which England selected a predominantly Midlands based team, another five players made their debut, of which Joseph Marsden of Darwen and Jem Bayliss of West Bromwich Albion (both defenders) were not selected again.
