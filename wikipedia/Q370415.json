An adept at every form of indoor and outdoor sport, he dribbled like an angel, and shot like a demon. Not nearly so deadly as his comrade, Whateley, he scored his share of goals. Whatever he did he did well, and was neatness personified. Could scarcely be played in wrong position, and was saturated through and through with the Aston Villa spirit. Scored the only goal in the famous cup tie against Queens Park in Glasgow, in 1884. Made a famous wing in company with Eli Davis. A keen judge of most games, a thorough sportsman, he has enriched sport in many directions.\nHe died in Birmingham on 6 January 1937, three days before what would have been his 76th birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malcolm Macdonald", "response": ["On 16 April 1975, in a European Championship qualifier also held at Wembley Macdonald scored all five goals in a 5\u20130 victory for England against Cyprus equalling the record for the most goals scored in a single game by an England player.
