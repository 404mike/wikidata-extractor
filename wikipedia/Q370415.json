Five of his goals were scored in a 13-0 victory over Ireland in Belfast on 18 February 1882, with his Villa team-mate Arthur Brown contributing four.After his football career ended he ran a silversmith's firm and was charged with making a new FA Cup after the original disappeared in mysterious circumstances in 1895.\nThe peoples favourite, and one of Archie Hunter's pet pupils. An adept at every form of indoor and outdoor sport, he dribbled like an angel, and shot like a demon. Not nearly so deadly as his comrade, Whateley, he scored his share of goals. Whatever he did he did well, and was neatness personified. Could scarcely be played in wrong position, and was saturated through and through with the Aston Villa spirit. Scored the only goal in the famous cup tie against Queens Park in Glasgow, in 1884. Made a famous wing in company with Eli Davis. A keen judge of most games, a thorough sportsman, he has enriched sport in many directions.\nHe died in Birmingham on 6 January 1937, three days before what would have been his 76th birthday.", "link_mentions": {}}}
