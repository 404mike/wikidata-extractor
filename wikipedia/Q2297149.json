He also played on albums by Dolly Parton, Iggy Pop, and Joan Armatrading.  He performed in a music video with Nancy Wilson of Heart. He has also performed much session work including The Bee Gees track \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\", along with fellow Juniors guitarist Alan Kendall. He was also the drummer for The Kids of Widney High and played on their second album, \"Let's Get Busy.\"\nHe lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, where he worked for a time as a photo technician and, since 2006, has performed music regularly with various musical combos including 30 Second Crash, Meat Raffle Road, and Sheely Dan, which also featured his wife, Kathy Glascock and the late Loren Walsted, former guitarist of the Underbeats. Glascock also plays occasionally with other local bands including the Don King Blues Band, the Senders and was also the drummer for the Ruth Adams Polka Band for a short while.\nHe is the brother of the late John Glascock (1951\u20131979), who was the bassist of The Gods and later Toe Fat, Carmen and, most notably, Jethro Tull.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Captain Beyond", "response": ["Following that album, Caldwell left the band to join Derringer and was replaced by Brian Glascock.Captain Beyond at deep-purple.net Also joining the band around that time were keyboardist Reese Wynans and conguero Guille Garcia. The record company's chosen producer, Giorgio Gomelsky, did not like Glascock's drumming and requested a new drummer. Glascock was released and Marty Rodriguez was brought in on drums on the recommendation of Garcia. This six-man lineup recorded the group's second album, Sufficiently Breathless, with producer and Capricorn Records co-founder Phil Walden. Tension during the recording led to Evans quitting, and the band splitting consequently. The original lineup reformed later in 1973 for gigs in the US and Canada that ran through at least mid-April 1974.

Hensley wrote most of the material, sang and played the Hammond B3 organ as the band already had Taylor on guitar. The Gods' line-up included, at one time or another, vocalist and guitar/bass player Greg Lake (later of King Crimson and Emerson, Lake & Palmer), bass player Paul Newton (later the first Uriah Heep bassist), drummer Lee Kerslake (later also of Heep), bassist John Glascock (later of Jethro Tull), and guitarist Joe Konas. In early 1968, they signed with Columbia Records and recorded two LPs and several singles. After that, Newton left the band to join Spice, an Essex-based band. Hensley also played on a one-album side project of The Gods initially planned to become their third album, but was recorded and eventually released in 1969/1970 under the moniker Head Machine's Orgasm. The album was produced by David Paramor (producer of \"The Gods\") and both Hensley and Kerslake featured, along with John Glascock on bass, Brian Glascock on drums, and David Paramor on vocals, all under pseudonyms. Hensley played mostly guitar again, as in the beginning of his career. Although Paramor was credited as composer, the songs bear many of Hensley's influences. The album was released before Hensley joined Toe Fat, and might almost be considered a prototype for the harder side of his future work in Uriah Heep."]}, {"page": "Kill City", "response": ["* Brian Glascock \u2013 drums, congas, African beaters, backing vocals, guiro"]}, {"page": "Paul Griggs", "response": ["Octopus, which included Griggs' brother Nigel, supported many well-known groups including Cream and Yes and they released one LP (Restless Night, Penny Farthing, April 1971) and several singles.

Several band members were used sparingly or not at all on the final recordings; in particular, studio drummer Craig Krampf replaced Brian Glascock on all tracks, Waddy Wachtel was featured on guitar in place of the departed McGovern, and the bass slot on several tracks was filled by one of two session players in place of Michael Goodroe.
