The takeover of the club by Ron Noades in the summer of 1998 (who installed himself as manager) brought an influx of money and younger players. Though he was still a regular, Bates was soon superseded as captain by new record-signing Hermann Hrei\u00f0arsson. He departed Griffin Park in March 1999, after making 526 appearances and scoring 24 goals in 13 years for Brentford.
