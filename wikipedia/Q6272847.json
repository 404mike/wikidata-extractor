After the run at the Queen's finished he turned to another part for which he became well known, John Worthing in The Importance of Being Earnest. Gielgud's biographer Jonathan Croall comments that the two roles illustrated two sides of the actor's personality: on the one hand the romantic and soulful Hamlet, and on the other the witty and superficial Worthing.Croall (2000), p. 131 The formidable Lady Bracknell was played by his aunt, Mabel Terry-Lewis. The Times observed, \"Mr Gielgud and Miss Terry-Lewis together are brilliant\u00a0... they have the supreme grace of always allowing Wilde to speak in his own voice.\"\"Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith\", The Times, 8 June 1930, p. 12"]}, {"page": "Sybil Thorndike", "response": ["Thorndike was born on 24 October 1882 in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, the eldest of the four children of Agnes Macdonald, daughter of ship engineer John Bowers, and Reverend Arthur John Webster Thorndike (1853\u20131917).

Having given the leading role to the young John Gielgud, but then finding that No\u00ebl Coward was available, Dean demoted Gielgud to understudy, despite the latter's unassailable contractual right to play the part. Dean's determination to have his own way made him, as The Times put it, \"something of a byword in the West End through his dictatorial methods at rehearsal\". Biographies of performers from Gielgud, Katherine Cornell and Vivien Leigh to Gracie Fields, Alan Napier and Barry Morse refer to Dean's bullying and cruelty and his unflattering nicknames: \"Bloody Basil\", \"The Basilisk\" and \"Bastard Basil\".Croall, p. 85; Collier, p. 101; Strachan, p. 30; Bret, p. 52; Napier, p. 135; and Morse, p. 77 Gielgud's biographer Jonathan Croall writes of Dean:"]}, {"page": "Harcourt Williams", "response": ["In 1929, when he was forty-nine, Lilian Baylis appointed Williams as the new director of her Old Vic theatre company.
