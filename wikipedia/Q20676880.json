The team included many players who were new to the sport, and some had never travelled on a plane before. The team officials were under no illusions about the difficulty of winning games, but saw the tournament as an opportunity to build their wheelchair basketball program, with an eye to qualifying for the 2024 Summer Paralympics in Paris. Similarly, the Australian U25 team, known as the Devils, was unashamedly a development team, with only one of its eleven players being a member of the senior team, the Gliders: Annabelle Lindsay, who had played in the 2018 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Hamburg in 2018. Most of the youthful side would be eligible to play in the next U25 championship, and three would be eligible to play in the next three. In contrast, Team Great Britain regarded itself as a serious contender, having won in Beijing in 2015, and the U24 European Wheelchair Basketball Championship in 2016 and 2018. The team included five members of the senior team:  Joy Haizelden,  Maddie Thompson, Kayla Bell, Siobhan Fitzpatrick and Charlotte Moore.", "In the crossover games, Germany bounced back from its defeat by Japan to defeat Thailand 52-14, and Turkey celebrated its first ever win, a 48-25 victory over South Africa. In the first semi-final, the USA beat Japan 78-24. In the second, the Devils came up against the undefeated Team GB. Both sides subjected the other to intense defensive pressure, with Team GB forcing the Devils into a series of eight second violations. Maddie Thompson was pulled off after she racked up three personal fouls, and the British defence struggled with height of Lindsay and Shadwell. A three-point buzzer beater from Joy Haizelden left Team GB just two points down at half time, but the Devils pushed their lead out to four points by three quarter time. Team GB's press forced multiple turnovers, but the Devils' pressure caused Team GB to miss many shots, and they ended with an average shooting accuracy of just 22 percent. In the end, Team GB's undefeated run ended, and the Devils were into the final with a 42-36 win."]}]}}
