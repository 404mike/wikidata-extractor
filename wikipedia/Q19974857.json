The election was a disappointment, with the National Party winning four fewer seats than its predecessors combined. In the state parliament the party held together for the time being, but there was much disruption amongst the extra-parliamentary forces, starting when the Queensland Farmers' Union withdrew from the National Political Council. Macartney also left the National Political Council and formed the more hardline Australian Democratic Union, which soon overcame its rival and the following the year the two merged as the National Democratic Council. A separate party, the Northern Country Party, also emerged as a regional division with the Nationalists.  Suffering ill health, Macartney stood down in 1920 to be succeeded by William Vowles. After six months, Vowles led the majority of National MLAs into a reformed Country Party. Walter Barnes, the deputy leader, became the new leader. The National Party, Country Party, Northern Country Party and National Labor Party all co-operated in the 1920 state election but were unable to dislodge Labor.
