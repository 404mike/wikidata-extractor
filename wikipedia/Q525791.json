The All-Sports show ended in 2007. Goldstein also presents Eurosports Home Nations Snooker tournaments. He previously presented Sky Sports coverage of Premier League Snooker, 9-Ball Pool (including the Mosconi Cup) and 10 pin bowling Weber Cup.\nAs well as presenting, Goldstein has tried his hand at acting too. He appeared as the main character in a series of adverts for TalkTalk shown before Big Brother 5 in 2004.\nGoldstein currently hosts The Sports Bar, a radio show which runs on talkSPORT from Monday to Thursday 10 pm to 1 am every week. The show initially broadcast on Sunday nights before being broadcast Monday to Thursday. Following George Galloway's departure from the station, it was increased to 4 nights per week.\nGoldstein is also a bad pool and snooker player having beaten Steve Davis as part of a feature on the All Sports Show, supposedly taking Davis' roll of honour (including his MBE, OBE, six World Championships and his Mosconi Cup win) with victory. When introducing the following week's All Sports Show, the caption on the screen read 'Andy Goldstein OBE MBE'. He uses the nickname of 'Galeforce' and in 2012 challenged badminton player Gail Emms to a showdown for the exclusive use of the nickname after claims by Emms that she was the first Galeforce.In 2006, Goldstein presented UKTV G2's coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.\nGoldstein took part in Andy Jacobs world record electric scooter land speed record as a pacemaker up to 78.4 mph then let Jacobs airflow to over 130 mph. At the time they were described as the Cool Runnings of the radio world as it was broadcast live.\nGoldstein erroneously reported that talkSPORT DJ and former Chelsea defender Jason Cundy had died after he failed to turn up to present his weekend show in October 2008. This led to some Chelsea fans laying flowers at Stamford Bridge and sending in condolences to the radio station. Goldstein later said he was only joking. On 3 August, Goldstein accused a Twitter account belonging to Rio Ferdinand as being fake. Shortly after, Rio Ferdinand rang the show to prove himself, hence forcing Goldstein to apologise. In August 2016, Goldstein mistakenly contacted a parody Twitter account of footballer Carlton Cole in an attempt to organise an interview with Cole himself. The account of Cole responded to his messages by quoting the lyrics to The Killers song Mr Brightside. He was also a childhood friend of Snooker player Ronnie O'Sullivan and the pair now work together as presenter and pundit on Eurosport's snooker tournaments. He also worked on Manchester United TV and is a Manchester United supporter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Andy Goldstein \u2013 UKTV G2 2006, Talksport 2008\u2013present", "* Andy Goldstein - Sky Sports 2020", "* Andy Goldstein \u2013 Sky Sports, Eurosport/Quest 2016\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Eddie Irvine", "response": ["In 2002, Irvine successfully sued TalkSport Radio for passing off his image in a print advertisement, as if he had personally endorsed the station.Irvine v Talksport.

When the crowd gave a mixed reaction to his comments, he turned to the spectators and attempted to rally them by calling \"Do you want to see us have an easy time out here?
