Having played in small pub bands since 1966 from the age of 14, McBrain paid his bills after graduating school with session work before he joined a variety of artists, such as Streetwalkers in 1975, Pat Travers, and the French political band, Trust. He joined Iron Maiden (replacing Clive Burr),  in time to debut on their fourth album Piece of Mind (1983), and has remained with them since, contributing to a total of fourteen studio releases, as well as being the third-longest serving member of the band.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 5", "response": ["*  1952   \u2013 Nicko McBrain, English drummer and songwriter"]}, {"page": "Iron Maiden", "response": ["The band played over 100 dates in North America supporting Scorpions, Judas Priest and Rainbow. Iron Maiden headlined some Canadian dates, New York, Chicago free show and the other soloed stops. They also performed at the biggest American festivals (Day on the Green, SuperFest, Pacific Jam, Rock Fest) which were held on big stadiums as Rich Stadium, Anaheim Stadium, Oakland Alameda Coliseum or Comiskey Park among many others. Iron Maiden were quickly promoted to the hard rock extra-league and avantgarde of heavy metal. The Number of the Beast is considered as the ground-breaking album for modern heavy metal and has been back on the album sales charts and the all time heavy metal albums polls constantly. The album's crowning track entitled \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is considered one of a few most important in the history of the genre, it has repeatedly held leading positions in various polls. After the first year of its release 2.5 million copies were sold. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; by 2010, the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide. The \"Golden Era\" in the band's history has begun Since a few decades The Number of the Beast is considered one of the albums of all time (Top 3, Top 5) in heavy music, and by December 2021 it had sold almost 20 million copies worldwide. In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain, who previously played for Trust. Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities, Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.", "Following their Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour in the summer of 2003, Iron Maiden released Dance of Death, their thirteenth studio album, which was met by worldwide critical and commercial success. The album reached No.\u00a02 in the UK Albums Chart and No.\u00a018 on the Billboard 200. Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band's regular producer, many critics felt that this release matched up to their earlier efforts, such as Killers, Piece of Mind and The Number of the Beast. As usual, historical, and literary references were present, with \"Monts\u00e9gur\" in particular being about the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244, and \"Paschendale\" relating to the significant battle which took place during the First World War. The album features successful singles \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Rainmaker\", epic title track and \"No More Lies\" (next ban's EP) acoustic ballad \"Journeyman\" and first ever song composed by Nicko McBrain entitled \"The New Frontier\". Musicians have recorded an album in London's Sarm West Studios which they used for the second time in 2006.", "Following confirmation from the group that 2010's The Final Frontier would not be their last album, Bruce Dickinson revealed plans for a sixteenth studio record in July 2013, with a potential release date in 2015. In February 2015, drummer Nicko McBrain revealed that a new album had been completed, although the release was put on hold as Dickinson was recovering from treatment for a cancerous tumour found on his tongue. On 15 May, after Dickinson was cleared for activities, manager Rod Smallwood confirmed that the album would be released in 2015, although the band would not tour until 2016 to allow Dickinson to continue recuperating. On 18 June 2015, the band's website announced its title, The Book of Souls, and confirmed a release date of 4 September 2015. It is the band's first original studio album not to be issued by EMI outside North America, following Parlophone's acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2013. It was a critical and commercial success, becoming the band's fifth UK No. 1 album and second No. 4 on Billboard 200 in the US. The new release reached number one positions in the album charts of 43 countries. Iron Maiden received many accolades and prestigious awards including The Rocks Awards, Silver Clef Award in recognition of outstanding contribution to UK music, Bandit Rock Awards, Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards, ECHO Award, Kerrang! Awards, Loudwire Awards, Burrn! Awards, Metal Hammer Germany Awards, Golden Gods Awards among many others. The Book of Souls went Gold and Platinum in twenty countries.", "As noticed music journalist Geoff Barton, the band's music constituted an important passage between the classic heavy rock school of the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, based on rhythm 'n blues, and contemporary heavy metal, characterised by sub-genre diversification and stylistic eclecticism. According to Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp the style and attitude of Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain has inspired generations of heavy-metal drummers that followed. As stated the former editor of the German magazine Rock Hard, G\u00f6tz K\u00fchnemund, Iron Maiden were (and still are) the inspiration for all the heavy metal bands we know today because they're an intrinsically heavy metal group. It is equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, hard rock \u2013 almost every genre. Iron Maiden took hard rock from the '70s, took it into the' 80s, and created a new genre that didn't exist before. This band introduced a DIY approach to all rock music. They even more than all the others popularised guitar harmonies in metal. Many metal bands in existence today have two guitarists, who use double guitar harmonies, and that's where they are inspired by Iron Maiden.", "Contrary to the accusations, the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, \"It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.\" Harris has also stated that \"The Number of the Beast\" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching Damien: Omen II, and also influenced by Robert Burns' \"Tam o' Shanter\". Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.", "Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith, has an operatic vocal style, inspired by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill, Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan, and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time. Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the Dance of Death album, Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, \"Steve loves playing with him.
