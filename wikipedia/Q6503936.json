The Greeks certainly laid the foundation for Western medical practice but much more of Western medicine can be traced to the Middle East, Germanic, and Celtic cultures. The Greek medical foundation comes from a collection of writings known today as the Hippocratic Corpus.Lawrence Conrad, Michael Neve, Vivian Nutton, Roy Porter, Andrew Wear.

Sophronius, who viewed the Saracen control of Palestine as \"unwitting representatives of God's inevitable chastisement of weak and wavering Christians\",Averil Cameron and Lawrence Conrad died soon after the fall of Jerusalem to the caliph Umar I in 637, but not before he had negotiated the recognition of civil and religious liberty for Christians in exchange for tribute - an agreement known as Umari Treaty. The caliph himself came to Jerusalem, and met with the patriarch at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Sophronius invited Umar to pray there, but Umar declined, fearing to endanger the Church's status as a Christian temple.Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades, vol. 1 The First Crusade (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 3-4."]}, {"page": "Historiography of early Islam", "response": ["In their study of the traditional Islamic accounts of the early conquest of different cities\u2014Damascus and Caesarea in Syria, Babilyn/al-Fusat and Alexandria in Egypt, Tustar in Khuzistan and Cordoba in Spain\u2014scholars Albrecht Noth and Lawrence Conrad find a suspicious pattern whereby the cities \"are all described as having fallen into the hands of the Muslims in precisely the same fashion\". There is a \"traitor who, ... points out a weak spot in the city's fortification to the Muslim besiegers; a celebration in the city which diverts the attention of the besieged; then a few assault troops who scale the walls, ... a shout of Allahu akbar! ... from the assault troops as a sign that they have entered the town; the opening of one of the gates from inside, and the onslaught of the entire army.\" They conclude these accounts can not be \"the reporting of history\" but are instead stereotyped story tales with little historical value. cited in  "]}, {"page": "Plague of Amwas", "response": ["The heavy toll on the indigenous Christian population and increased emigration from Syria as a result of the plague of Amwas may have been a contributing factor in the increased settlement of Syria by the Arabs and their penetration of local society during Umayyad rule (640s\u2013750). According to the historian Lawrence Conrad, the Arabs, relying on revenue from the poll tax collected from the non-Arabs in the conquered regions, may not have intended to settle Syria, but were forced to repopulate the deserted countryside in the aftermath of the plague. The policy of settling Arab tribesmen on the land proved exceptional; in other conquered areas, such as Iraq, early Arab settlement was mostly confined to newly built garrison cities."]}, {"page": "Modern usage of al-Q\u0101disiyyah", "response": ["* Noth, Albrecht (in collaboration with Lawrence Conrad).

The modern historian Lawrence Conrad has dismissed the 670s Arab occupation of Rhodes as a literary artifice by the early Islamic tradition. C. E. Bosworth has also dismissed the episode, in particular the implication that Junada continuously resided on the island during the supposed seven-year duration of the Arab presence as he is mentioned leading land and sea campaigns against Byzantine Anatolia throughout the 670s. The historian Marek Jankowiak has argued that \"there are no grounds to reject\" Junada's occupation of Rhodes."]}]}}
