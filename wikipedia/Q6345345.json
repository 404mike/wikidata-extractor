After replacing Chris Hackett in the 57th minute, he scored Northampton's second goal in a 2\u20130 victory. He bagged his second Northampton goal in his third match for the club, following up fellow Brentford loanee Luke Norris' opener in a 3\u20132 defeat to Rochdale on 22 October. On 5 November, Dallas' loan was extended until 1 January 2014. He scored the only goal of the game against Accrington Stanley on 30 November. An injury suffered to Brentford's on-loan Cardiff City winger Kadeem Harris meant that Dallas was recalled early from his loan on 23 December. He made 12 appearances for Northampton and scored three goals. Of his time at Northampton, Dallas said \"on a personal note my loan spell was OK. I was playing every week. It was a good experience but results did not go our way and it was hard, when you are at the bottom everything seems to go against you\". He also remarked that the training was less intense than he was used to at Brentford. Dallas signed a new two-year contract at Brentford on 13 November, which would have kept him at Griffin Park until the end of the 2015\u201316 season. Dallas found his minutes on the pitch limited during the early months of 2014, but he broke into the starting lineup in April, starting in six of the Bees' final seven games of the season. Dallas scored his first Brentford goal with what turned out to be a consolation in a 4\u20131 defeat to Colchester United on 26 April. He made it two in two games when he scored the opener in a 2\u20130 win over Stevenage on the final day.

Zoko doubled his tally 11 minutes later which was enough to secure victory for the Boro and leave the Bees 11th place in the table. After going a goal down against Colchester United a third straight league defeat seemed to be on the cards before three goals in eleven minutes turned the game. Marcello Trotta levelled the score in the 76th minute before George Saville netted his first league goal to put the Bees ahead. Kadeem Harris scored the third goal on his club debut following his loan from Cardiff City, and guaranteed the points and the win.", "The next game away to Bristol City saw Richard Lee return to the starting line up in goal for Brentford. City started strong and had the better of the first half, but the second half introduction of Sam Saunders for Kadeem Harris changed the game for the visitors as he became both scorer and provider. Saunders' 79th minute shot was deflected past the City keeper to put the Bees ahead and seven minutes later Clayton Donaldson was on hand to volley in a corner from the substitute. Marlon Harewood scored an injury-time consolation goal but was unable to prevent the extension of City's winless streak to 21 games.

Ben Nugent started in place of the suspended Harlee Dean and goals from Alan McCormack, Jake Reeves, Kadeem Harris, Marcello Trotta and Clayton Donaldson sealed a 5\u20130 win for the Bees. Crewe Alexandra were the next visitors to Griffin Park and they departed on the wrong end of another 5\u20130 scoreline. Crewe defended well until the deadlock was broken on the 43rd minute by Marcello Trotta with a long range header.
