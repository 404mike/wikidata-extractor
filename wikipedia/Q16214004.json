He began his career in non-league football at Hertford Town and moved to the Football League with Gillingham in 1994. Shortly after, he moved to Brentford, for whom he made eight appearances in an 18-month spell. After his release in 1996, Hooker returned to non-league football and retired in 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ijah Anderson", "response": ["Anderson joined Second Division club Brentford on a free transfer in July 1995 and signed a two-year contract. He began the 1995\u201396 season as manager David Webb's first choice left midfielder, before being dropped in favour of Jon Hooker in September 1995. Anderson continued as a substitute throughout much of the season, before gradually breaking into the team at left back and was such an able deputy that regular left back Martin Grainger was able to be sold in March 1996. He made 31 appearances and scored three goals during the 1995\u201396 season. Anderson signed a contract extension in September 1996 and missed just three matches of the 1996\u201397 season, making 56 appearances, but the campaign ended on a sour note with defeat in the 1997 Second Division play-off Final. Anderson was again a regular during the 1997\u201398 season, before a broken leg suffered in training in November 1997 ended his season."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Jon Hooker", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jon Hooker", "| Jon Hooker"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Jon Hooker", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jon Hooker", "|14 November 1994|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|MF|| Jon Hooker|| Gillingham||\u00a35,000||"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["During the course of the season, 31 players played for Gillingham in competitive matches.
