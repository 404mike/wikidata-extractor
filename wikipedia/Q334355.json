He held office under William Ewart Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1868 and 1873 and as Home Secretary between 1873 and 1874. Lowe is remembered for his work in education policy, his opposition to electoral reform and his contribution to modern UK company law. Gladstone appointed Lowe as Chancellor expecting him to hold down public spending. Public spending rose, and Gladstone pronounced Lowe \"wretchedly deficient\"; most historians agree. Lowe repeatedly underestimated the revenue, enabling him to resist demands for tax cuts and to reduce the national debt instead. He insisted that the tax system be fair to all classes. By his own main criterion of fairness \u2013 that the balance between direct and indirect taxation remain unchanged \u2013 he succeeded. However historians do not believe this balance is a good measure of class incidence and was by that time thoroughly archaic.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
