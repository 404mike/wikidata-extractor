He held office under William Ewart Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1868 and 1873 and as Home Secretary between 1873 and 1874. Lowe is remembered for his work in education policy, his opposition to electoral reform and his contribution to modern UK company law. Gladstone appointed Lowe as Chancellor expecting him to hold down public spending. Public spending rose, and Gladstone pronounced Lowe \"wretchedly deficient\"; most historians agree. Lowe repeatedly underestimated the revenue, enabling him to resist demands for tax cuts and to reduce the national debt instead. He insisted that the tax system be fair to all classes. By his own main criterion of fairness \u2013 that the balance between direct and indirect taxation remain unchanged \u2013 he succeeded. However historians do not believe this balance is a good measure of class incidence and was by that time thoroughly archaic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Disraeli", "response": ["Once the desired bill was prepared, Disraeli's handling of it was not adept. He neglected to notify either the Prince of Wales or the Opposition, and was met by irritation from the prince and a full-scale attack from the Liberals. An old enemy of Disraeli, former Liberal Chancellor Robert Lowe, alleged during the debate in the Commons that two previous Prime Ministers had refused to introduce such legislation for the Queen. Gladstone immediately stated that he was not one of them, and the Queen gave Disraeli leave to quote her saying she had never approached a Prime Minister with such a proposal. According to Blake, Disraeli \"in a brilliant oration of withering invective proceeded to destroy Lowe\", who apologised and never held office again.Blake (1967), pp. 563\u2013564 Disraeli said of Lowe that he was the only person in London with whom he would not shake hands and, \"he is in the mud and there I leave him.\"Blake (1967), p. 564"]}, {"page": "Corporation", "response": ["However, there was still no limited liability and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company.Re Sea Fire and Life Assurance Co., Greenwood's Case (1854) 3 De GM&G 459 The next, crucial development, then, was the Limited Liability Act 1855, passed at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Robert Lowe.

The Conservatives then formed a ministry, in which after long Parliamentary debate Disraeli passed the Second Reform Act of 1867; Gladstone's proposed bill had been totally outmanoeuvred; he stormed into the Chamber, but too late to see his arch-enemy pass the bill. Gladstone was furious; his animus commenced a long rivalry that would only end on Disraeli's death and Gladstone's encomium in the Commons in 1881.James Winter, \"The Cave of Adullam and parliamentary reform.\" English Historical Review 81.318 (1966): 38-55."]}, {"page": "Chancellor of the Exchequer", "response": ["A previous chancellor, Robert Lowe, described the office in the following terms in the House of Commons, on 11 April 1870: \"The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a man whose duties make him more or less of a taxing machine.
