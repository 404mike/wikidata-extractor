According to Trilling, Tyndall's \"speeches were pompous but studied\u00a0... [he] copied the hand gestures, the rising delivery that ended in a crescendo of angry epithets [from Hitler]\u00a0... But it was flat and tedious, like a provincial PE teacher trying to show his bored pupils how the rugby or football greats might have done it.\" After Tyndall's death, the BNP spokesman Phil Edwards said that \"he was a marvellous speaker. He could hold a room and mesmerise them, but he did not have the answer to the problems.\" Copsey stated that \"Tyndall may have been a rousing speaker, but his tactical intelligence and vision left much to be desired\". The East London BNP activist Eddy Butler noted that at a 1986 party rally in Dewsbury, Tyndall \"lost them completely. He knew how to talk to a small room of nationalists, but he didn't know how to talk to a thousand Yorkshire young geezers. He hadn't got a clue about normal people or normal politics. He'd go on about the Britain of Sir Francis Drake; you'd think 'what's he on about?'\"."]}, {"page": "John Bean (politician)", "response": ["Due to dissatisfaction with his leadership, Bean demanded that Griffin resign as National Chairman and focus more on the North West region.John Bean calls on Nick Griffin to Resign, from Eddy Butler's blog"]}, {"page": "Derek Beackon", "response": ["Under the directorship of local organizer Eddy Butler, the party had instigated a 'Rights for Whites' campaign in the area, bringing back a slogan that had been employed by Martin Webster and the NF during the 1970s. Focusing on the perceived negative impact of immigration on the area of employment and housing, the campaign operated as if it was simply a local pressure group before gradually introducing the BNP name into Rights for Whites literature.", "Before and during his run as a Tower Hamlets councillor, Beackon served as the BNP's chief steward, which included the job of ensuring order at BNP meetings. As chief steward he was given the job of leading the party's bodyguard group set up in 1992. Made up largely of casuals and white power skinheads, the group soon proved difficult for the middle-aged Beackon to control, and before long, real control lay with Charlie Sargent and his brother Steve. Following Beackon's election, the group became disillusioned with the electoral path and broke away from the BNP, adopting the name Combat 18. Eddy Butler and Tony Lecomber were among the BNP members targeted for attack, in what became a bitter split."]}, {"page": "Flag Group", "response": ["As a separate group, the Flag Group contested Bristol East in the 1987 general election.David Boothroyd, Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties, 2001, p. 190 By the 1989 Vauxhall by-election, they had resumed using the National Front name, even though their candidate Ted Budden faced opposition from Official National Front candidate Patrick Harrington. Other elections contested included the Epping Forest by-election of December 1988, the European Parliament election of 1989 in which the West Midlands seat was fought by Wingfield and the Mid-Staffordshire by-election of March 1990 in which the party finished behind even parody candidate Screaming Lord Sutch. This policy of contesting elections, invariably with very disappointing results, left the Flag Group with a significant funding shortage. By 1989 the Flag Group had around 1,500 members with most activity centred on the West Midlands.Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism, p. 46 Another activity centre had been Tower Hamlets although following the failure of the 'Nationalist Alliance' initiative this group, which included future BNP Campaign Director Eddy Butler, switched en bloc to the BNP.Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism, p. 38"]}]}}
