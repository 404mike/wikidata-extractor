Born in Nottingham, he was a left-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Derbyshire in 2004.\nDerbyshire were to offer him a two-year contract, after the selectors saw enough in the young bowler before signing professionally.\nHe only achieved one first-class innings in his career and was released in 2005. However, he played extensively for the Second XI side between his 2003 debut, and Derbyshire's consecutive eleventh-placed seasons of 2004 and 2005, picking up a career best of 97* against Lancashire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Chapman", "response": ["James Chapman may refer to:", "*James Chapman (explorer) (1831\u20131872), South African explorer, hunter, trader and photographer", "*James Chapman (author) (born 1955), American novelist", "*James Chapman (media historian) (born 1968), British media historian", "*James Chapman (bishop) (died 1879), Anglican Bishop of Colombo", "*James Chapman (Australian politician) (1855\u20131925), Tasmanian politician", "*James Chapman (cricketer) (born 1986), English cricketer", "*James Chapman (footballer) (1932\u20131993), Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy", "*James Chapman (musician), English musician, known professionally as Maps", "*James Chapman (rower) (born 1979), Australian rower"]}]}}
