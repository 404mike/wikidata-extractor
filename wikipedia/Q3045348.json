In 1938, a year after the Japanese invasion of northern China and occupation of central coastal areas, he sneaks into Nanjing, China, by pretending to be a Red Cross aid worker. Arriving in Nanjing, Hogg witnesses and photographs the poverty, ruins, and corpses on the streets.  He proceeds to write a daily journal about his findings when he is interrupted by the sounds from outside. Upon peering outside the window, Hogg witnesses Japanese soldiers round up Chinese refugees and proceed to massacre the group. He anxiously takes photos of this event by the window. Later at night, Hogg is captured by the Japanese while photographing them committing atrocities. He is about to be executed when Chen Hansheng (Chow Yun-fat), a Chinese communist resistance fighter, saves him. While hiding in the rubble with Hansheng, Hogg witnesses the execution of two of his colleagues by the Japanese. Overwhelmed by shock, he inadvertently reveals their presence. A firefight ensues, and Hogg is wounded. He wakes up to Lee Pearson (Radha Mitchell), checking on his wounds and discovers he has been brought to a rebel camp. With nowhere to go for now, Hansheng tells Hogg, on Lee's suggestion, to rest at an orphanage housing 56 young boys and only an aged grandmother to take care of them. However, on the night of his arrival, Hogg is called out by one of the boys to a strange location, and he is savagely attacked with sticks by the orphans.  Thankfully, Lee arrives just in time and threatens to abandon the boys, leaving them without medical supplies or food. Lee explains to Hogg that she runs the orphanage and drops by from time to time with supplies."]}, {"page": "Hogg (surname)", "response": ["* George Hogg (footballer) (born 1869), Scottish footballer with Heart of Midlothian", "* George Hogg (adventurer) (1914\u20131945), British adventurer in China"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (G)", "response": ["# George Hogg (adventurer)"]}, {"page": "George Hogg", "response": ["George Hogg may refer to:", "* George Hogg (adventurer) (1915\u20131945), English adventurer", "* George Hogg (footballer) (1869\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "* George Hogg (priest) (born 1910), Archdeacon of Cashel and Emly"]}, {"page": "List of historical films set in Asia", "response": ["| The Children of Huang Shi || 2008 || 1938 || about George Hogg leading 60 orphans across China in an effort to save them from conscription during the Second Sino-Japanese War"]}, {"page": "Jiang Guangtao", "response": ["*The Children of Huang Shi -  George Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers)"]}, {"page": "List of Wadham College, Oxford people", "response": ["* George Hogg, adventurer"]}, {"page": "List of films based on actual events (2000\u2013present)", "response": ["* The Children of Huang Shi (2008) \u2013 Australian/Chinese/German historical war drama film centering on the true story of George Hogg and the sixty orphans that he led across China in an effort to save them from conscription during the Second Sino-Japanese war"]}]}}
