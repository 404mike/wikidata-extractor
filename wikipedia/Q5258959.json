One of his closest friends was the cricketer Dennis Silk who later became Warden (headmaster) of Radley College. He also formed a close friendship with Vivien Hancock, then headmistress of Greenways School at Ashton Gifford, where his son George was a pupil. The relationship provoked Hester to make strong accusations against Hancock, who responded with the threat of legal action."]}, {"page": "1931 in literature", "response": ["*October 8 \u2013 Dennis Silk, American-born English writer on literature and cricket, and first-class cricketer (died 2019)"]}, {"page": "Silk (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Dennis Silk (born 1931), British schoolmaster and international cricketer"]}, {"page": "Neville Cardus", "response": ["In the conventional sense, Cardus was not a religious man; Dennis Silk, a one-time MCC president, suggests that Cardus's religion was \"friendship\".Daniels, p. xxii In Autobiography Cardus says he found his Kingdom of Heaven in the arts, \"the only religion that is real and, once found, omnipresent\"\u2014though his rationalism was shaken, he confesses, when he came to understand the late string quartets of Beethoven.

This was followed in 1954 by a tour to England on which Canada played eighteen games, four of which were given first-class status, including one against Pakistan who were also touring England at the same time. The MCC again visited Canada in 1959 under Dennis Silk, and played a 3-day game against a Canada XI in Toronto which they won by 10 wickets. They were undefeated throughout the tour, winning most of their matches by wide margins, but had a closely fought draw against the Toronto Cricket Club.Wisden 1960, pp. 870\u201371. This was the decade when the Imperial Cricket Conference had plans to grant Canada Test status, but Canada themselves postponed the idea as they felt that the Canadian national team was not of sufficient standard, and that competing against full-members' sides needed some time as they wanted to improve their cricket even domestically.
