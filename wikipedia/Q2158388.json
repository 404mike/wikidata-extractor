According to historian Robert Nisbet Bain, it was one of her \"chief glories that, so far as she was able, she put a stop to that mischievous contention of rival ambitions at Court, which had disgraced the reigns of Peter II, Anne and Ivan VI, and enabled foreign powers to freely interfere in the domestic affairs of Russia.\"", "Elizabeth enjoyed and excelled in architecture, overseeing and financing many construction projects during her reign. One of the many projects from the Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli was the reconstruction of Peterhof Palace, adding several wings\u00a0between 1745 and 1755. Her most famous creations were the Winter Palace, though she died before its completion, and the Smolny Convent. The Palace is said to contain 1,500 rooms, 1,786 doors and 1,945 windows, including bureaucratic offices and the Imperial Family's living quarters arranged in two enfilades, from the top of the Jordan Staircase. Regarding the latter building, Robert Nisbet Bain stated that \"No other Russian sovereign ever erected so many churches.\""]}, {"page": "Sigismund III Vasa", "response": ["Sigismund sought to join the Catholic side of the Thirty Years' War, but was denied by the Polish parliament.
