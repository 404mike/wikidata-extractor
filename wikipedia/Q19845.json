Their slogan \"girl power\" was most closely associated with Halliwell, and her Union Jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards also became an enduring symbol. Halliwell left the Spice Girls in 1998, citing exhaustion and creative differences, but rejoined when they reunited in 2007.In 1999, Halliwell released her debut solo album, Schizophonic, which produced the UK number-one singles \"Mi Chico Latino\", \"Lift Me Up\" and \"Bag It Up\"; the lead single, \"Look at Me\", reached number two. In 2001, she released her second album, Scream If You Wanna Go Faster; the lead single, \"It's Raining Men\", reached number one in the UK, the biggest hit of her career. \"Scream If You Wanna Go Faster\" and \"Calling\", were also top-ten singles.

Chisholm missed the second audition after coming down with tonsillitis. Despite missing the first round of auditions, Geri Halliwell persuaded the Herberts to let her attend the second. A week after the second audition, Adams, Brown, Halliwell and Stephenson were asked to attend a recall at Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, performing \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" on their own and as a group.
