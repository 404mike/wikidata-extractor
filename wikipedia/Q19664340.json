Michiko Kakutani called the novel a \"ferociously well-paced entertainment\", which \"succeeds magnificently\" and heavily attributed the success of the book to Tartt's well-developed writing skills. Sophie McKenzie, writing for The Independent, called it \"the book of a lifetime\", stating that it was \"perfectly paced\" and the characters are \"fascinating and powerfully drawn\". However, James Wood of the London Review of Books gave it a mediocre review, writing: \"The story compels, but it doesn't involve...It offers mysteries and polished revelations on every page, but its true secrets are too deep, too unintended to be menacing or profound.\" Critic Ted Gioia wrote:There is much to admire in Tartt's novel, but it is especially laudable for how persuasively she chronicles the steps from studying classics to committing murder. This is a difficult transition to relate in a believable manner, and all the more difficult given Tartt's decision to tell the story from the perspective of one of the most genial of the conspirators.  Her story could easily come across as implausible\u2014or even risible\u2014in its recreation of Dionysian rites on a Vermont college campus, and its attempt to convince us that a mild-mannered transfer student with a taste for ancient languages can evolve, through a series of almost random events, into a killer. Yet convince us she does, and the intimacy with which Tartt brings her readers into the psychological miasma of the unfolding plot is one of the most compelling features of The Secret History."]}, {"page": "Sydenham High School", "response": ["*Sophie McKenzie, author of books such as Blood Ties"]}, {"page": "Manchester Book Award", "response": ["*2009 Six Steps to a Girl by Sophie McKenzie", "*2008 Girl, Missing by Sophie McKenzie", "**Six Steps to a Girl by Sophie McKenzie", "**Girl, Missing by Sophie McKenzie", "**Six Steps To A Girl by Sophie McKenzie", "**Girl, Missing by Sophie McKenzie"]}, {"page": "Girl, Missing", "response": ["Girl, Missing is an English-language young adult thriller novel by Sophie McKenzie, published in 2006."]}, {"page": "Lancashire Book of the Year", "response": ["** First place: Sophie McKenzie, Blood Ties"]}, {"page": "Hampshire Book Awards", "response": ["**Medusa Project: The Set-Up by Sophie McKenzie"]}, {"page": "Bolton Children's Book Award", "response": ["|Sophie McKenzie", "**Girl, Missing by Sophie McKenzie"]}, {"page": "Red House Children's Book Award", "response": ["** Older Readers: Split Second by Sophie McKenzie (Simon and Schuster)", "** Older Readers: The Medusa Project: Hit Squad by Sophie McKenzie (Simon & Schuster)", "* Overall: Blood Ties by Sophie McKenzie (Simon & Schuster)", "** Older Readers: Blood Ties by Sophie McKenzie (Simon & Schuster)", "** Older Readers: Girl, Missing by Sophie McKenzie (Simon & Schuster)"]}, {"page": "List of books from the Richard & Judy Book Club", "response": ["* Sophie McKenzie \u2013 close My Eyes ", "** Sophie McKenzie \u2013 Girl, Missing"]}, {"page": "Blood Ties (McKenzie novel)", "response": ["Blood Ties is a 2008 thriller science fiction novel written by Sophie McKenzie."]}, {"page": "Concorde Book Award", "response": ["|Sophie McKenzie"]}, {"page": "List of World Book Day books", "response": ["* Flip book containing The Medusa Project: The Thief by Sophie McKenzie (Simon & Schuster Children's Books) and Walking the Walls by Chris Higgins (Hodder Children's Books)", "* Acting Friends by Sophie McKenzie (Simon and Schuster)", "* Boy, Missing written by Sophie McKenzie (Simon & Schuster)"]}, {"page": "List of Simon & Schuster authors", "response": ["* Sophie McKenzie, British author of Young Adult Novels"]}, {"page": "Marisa Calin", "response": ["As an audiobook narrator, Calin has earned an Audie Award nomination for full cast recording of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s Fairytales, and an Audie win for Sadie by Courtney Summers.
