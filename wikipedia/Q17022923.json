The UK Civil Aviation Authority funded an engineering\u2013medical joint research team, led by Nigel Rock of Hawtal Whiting Engineering Consultants and Prof. Angus Wallace of the Nottingham University Hospital and aided by Wing Commander David Anton of the Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine. Crash data was supplemented by medical information from the University of Nottingham and testing at the Institute of Aviation Medicine. The work used mathematical modelling derived from the automobile industry to analyse the human body under crash conditions.

An article by Angus Wallace in the British Medical Journal (BMJ vol 332 11 March 2006) suggested that treatments may be proportionally less successful in ISTCs due to the employment of inexperienced or less fully trained staff with less backup than the NHS facilities. This could result in the NHS having to fund difficult revision operations (insofar as they can be so revised) and would defeat the object of the exercise. However, a subsequent study conducted by the researchers from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Royal College of Surgeons of England confirmed the high quality of care, concluding that \"patients undergoing cataract surgery or hip replacements in ISTCs achieved a slightly greater improvement \u2026 than those treated in NHS facilities\" and \"Patients treated in ISTCs were less likely to report post-operative problems than those treated in NHS facilities\u2026\"(BMC Health Services Research 2008. 8:78).John Browne, Liz Jamieson, Jim Lewsey, Jan van der Meulen, Lynn Copley and Nick Black (2008), Case-mix & patients' reports of outcome in Independent Sector Treatment Centres: Comparison with NHS providers.

ISTC contracts typically exclude referrals of older, fatter and sicker patients, so comparisons with results in NHS hospitals who deal with these more difficult patients is difficult.
