He also recorded material for Phil Pratt and Sonia Pottinger the same year. He had almost immediate success with songs including \"The Train Is Coming\" (on which he was backed by the Wailers), the first, ska version, of later reggae song You're No Good with Soulettes (the group Bob Marley's future wife Rita Anderson was in) on B-side, and \"Lonely Teardrops\". The following year, Boothe and Alton Ellis had a successful UK tour with the Studio One session group, the Soul Vendors. Boothe was promoted as \"Mr. Rock Steady\" by Dodd during this period. The rocksteady classic \"Moving Away\" was released in 1967 or 1968 on the Coxsone label. \"Moving Away\" is a song still popular today, and covered or sampled by many artists, among them Dennis Brown, Jackie Mittoo (\"Macka Fat\"), Jack Radics I-Roy, U-Roy (\"African Message\"), Janet Key, Jaime Hinckson, Romain des Bois, Bruno Mars, Al Campbell (\"Dress Black\" Garnett Silk (\"It's Growing\"), Half Pint (\"Substitute Lover\"), Wayne Wonder (\"Time To Say Good Bye\"), Leroy Smart (\"Talk About Friends\"), Sanchez (\"Don't Worry\"), Admiral Tibet (\"Nuthin Nah Run\" among many others. Many of Boothe's songs have been reused in one way or another. On the B-side of the single \"Moving Away\" was the instrumental \"Streets of Gold\" by the Skatalites. Boothe continued to record for Dodd until 1970, when he switched to producer Leslie Kong's Beverley's Records and reggae, where his success continued with hits such as \"Freedom Street\" and \"Why Baby Why\".Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 34."]}, {"page": "The Vampire Lovers", "response": ["* Janet Key as Gretchin, the maid"]}, {"page": "Special Branch (TV series)", "response": ["Other actors appearing included: Paul Darrow (\"Short Change\"), Garfield Morgan and Rula Lenska (\"Something About a Soldier\"), Jacqueline Pearce (\"Catherine the Great\"), Cyd Hayman (\"Rendezvous\"), Susan Jameson as Detective Sergeant Mary Holmes (\"Date of Birth\", \"Intercept\", and \"Downwind of Angels\"), John Bindon (\"Intercept\"), Peter Bowles and Janet Key (\"Downwind of Angels\"), Nicolette McKenzie (\"Diversion\"), Denis Lill (\"Diversion\"), Kenneth Colley (\"Date of Birth\") and Stephanie Beacham (\"Threat\")."]}, {"page": "The Karnstein Trilogy", "response": ["| Janet Key"]}, {"page": "Dracula A.D. 1972", "response": ["* Janet Key as Anna Bryant"]}, {"page": "Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984 film)", "response": ["* Janet Key as the Instructress "]}, {"page": "And Now the Screaming Starts!", "response": ["* Janet Key as Bridget"]}, {"page": "Gawn Grainger", "response": ["His first marriage was to the actress Janet Key in 1970.
