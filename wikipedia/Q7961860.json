He also performed an act of \"Bloodless Surgery\", claiming he could use electricity, hypnosis and manipulation to cure \"all kinds of ailments and disabilities\". His performances were enormously popular in the early 20th century, and inspired both Harry Houdini and Charlie Chaplin.His touting of medical skill displeased the medical profession of the time, who labelled him a 'quack,' and took him to court over the use of the word 'doctor.' Yet Bodie was also a great showman and stage performer, and it was the combination of showmanship, as well as his apparent 'cures,' that provided the magnet for his huge success. Ricky Jay, American hypnotist, and author of the best-selling book, 'Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women,' accredits Bodie with the origination of many of today's comic interludes in stage hypnotism. In other words, the originator of much of the 'humorous hypnosis' we see on stage to this very day, while Professor Edwin A. Dawes states that 'as a ventriloquist (in his later stage review, 'Fun on an Ocean Liner') he was superb.'\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Houdini", "response": ["* Walford BodieA friend of Houdini, and fellow magician"]}, {"page": "Macduff, Aberdeenshire", "response": ["* Walford Bodie (1869\u20131939), magician and showman, Manor House Macduff 1905 to 1939"]}, {"page": "George Formby Sr", "response": ["In 1897 or 1898 Formby was signed to appear at the Lyceum Theatre, Blackburn, supporting the magician Walford Bodie; a 40-week tour followed, with Formby earning 30 shillings a week. In 1898, while performing at the Wigan Empire as part of the tour, Formby met Eliza Hoy, the daughter of the Empire's cashier. The couple married in August the following year at Wigan Registry Office, although this marriage was bigamous because of his union two years previously with Salter. In the months after their marriage, Eliza persuaded Formby to join the Roman Catholic Church, which helped her parents overcome their initial distrust of him. Formby and Eliza had thirteen children, of whom seven survived: four daughters and three sons. The cultural historian David Bret states that Formby was \"possessed of staggering consumptive virility\", as the comedian also had several children with other partners. Eliza became an important figure in Formby's professional life, making his costumes and standing in the wings during his performances to help him. Eliza also continued working as a seamstress and would sell chips during lunchtimes to supplement the family's income."]}, {"page": "1869 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 June \u2013 Walford Bodie, stage magician (died 1939)"]}, {"page": "Britannia Music Hall", "response": ["|Dr Walford Bodie"]}, {"page": "Dr Walford Bodie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Walford Bodie"]}, {"page": "1869 in Scotland", "response": ["* 11 June \u2013 Walford Bodie, stage magician (died 1939)"]}, {"page": "Stonehaven Town Hall", "response": ["The building was used as an events venue from an early stage: the showman, Walford Bodie, conducted his first public performance of hypnosis, ventriloquism and magic in the town hall, at the age of 15, in 1884.
