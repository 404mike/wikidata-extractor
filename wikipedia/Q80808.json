Smith recommended Davidson saying there was no one better. Smith and Davidson had worked together in a previous band.\nHe was one of three members of the group who wrote songs. He wrote their 1965 hit \"Catch Us If You Can\", and contributed five more tunes on the Having A Wild Weekend soundtrack album, although Lenny was the only member of the group not to have one single line of dialogue in the film. \nHe contributed \"Crying Over You\" and \"When\" to their 1965 Coast to Coast album, and sang lead on the 1967 hit \"Everybody Knows\" which reached number 2 on the British charts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 30", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Lenny Davidson, English guitarist and songwriter"]}, {"page": "List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees", "response": ["| 75px|Get Yourself a College Girl appearance, 1964 - From left: Mike Smith, Lenny Davidson, Denis Payton, Rick Huxley, and Dave Clark.", "| Dave Clark, Lenny Davidson, Rick Huxley, Denis Payton, and Mike Smith."]}, {"page": "The Dave Clark Five", "response": ["thumb|The Ed Sullivan Show in 1966.
