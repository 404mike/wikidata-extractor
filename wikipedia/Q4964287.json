He is well known as the bass in the King's Singers during the group's formative years from 1968 until 1982, and as such is to be heard on many of their 1970s LP recordings. He was also the voice of Papageno in the film Amadeus and the lowest frog in the Paul McCartney song We All Stand Together (The Frog's Chorus).\nHe is noted as a choral conductor, being former conductor (and now President) of the Leith Hill Musical Festival and former director of the Huddersfield Choral Society. He is Principal Conductor of The Really Big Chorus.\nOn radio, he has been a presenter of Friday Night is Music Night on BBC Radio 2 and until 2006 presented 3 for All and Brian Kay's Light Programme, a weekly programme about light music on BBC Radio 3. In 1996 he won the Sony Radio Award as Music Presenter of the Year.\nHe is a Patron of Bampton Classical Opera and President of The English Arts Chorale, the Harrogate Choral Society and of the Bristol Bach Choir\nBrian is the Vice President of the Royal School of Church Music", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC Radio 3", "response": ["Drummond's successor was Nicholas Kenyon, previously chief music critic of The Observer, who took over in February 1992 and was immediately faced with the looming launch date for commercial competitor Classic FM who were, and still remain, Radio 3's biggest rivals. Kenyon, similar to Singer a decade earlier, believed that Radio 3 had to make changes to its presentation before the new station began broadcasting rather than react later. As a result, three senior producers were sent to study classical music stations in the United States and the station hired advertising agents Saatchi & Saatchi to help improve public perception. Kenyon's tenure was to meet with much controversy: in attempts to update the station's presentation, popular announcers Malcolm Ruthven, Peter Barker and Tony Scotland were axed as well as drama being cut by a quarter, resulting in a letter of protest to The Times signed by Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and Fay Weldon among others; two new programmes for drive time, entitled On Air and In Tune, were launched and a new three-hour programme of popular classics on Sunday mornings fronted by Brian Kay was also launched.", "In 1998, Roger Wright took over as controller of the station. Soon after his appointment some changes were made to showcase a wider variety of music; a new, relaxed, late-night music programme Late Junction featured a wide variety of genres; programmes focusing on jazz and world music were given a higher profile as were programmes presented by Brian Kay, focusing on light music, and Andy Kershaw, whose show was previously dropped by Radio 1. In these changes, Wright believed that, in the case of the former, he was addressing \"this feeling people had that they didn't want to put Radio 3 on unless they were going to listen carefully\" and in the latter cases that he was \"not dumbing down but smarting up\" the programmes.", "By 2008, however, the station faced pressures to increase its audience by making programmes more accessible while loyal listeners began to complain about the tone of these new changes. Presentation was described as \"gruesome in tone and level\" and global music output was mocked as \"street-smart fusions\" and \"global pop\". At the same time RAJAR began to record lower listening figures and decisions on policy were being changed resulting in the children's programme Making Tracks, experimental music programme Mixing It, theatre and film programme Stage and Screen and Brian Kay's Light Programme all being dropped, a reduction in the number of concerts and format changes to several other programmes. In spite of the changes, figures still continued to fall."]}, {"page": "John Rutter", "response": ["* Birthday Madrigals for SATB, commissioned in 1995 by Brian Kay and the Cheltenham Bach Choir to celebrate the 75th birthday of George Shearing"]}, {"page": "BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition", "response": ["* Brian Kay (1983\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "Radio Academy Awards", "response": ["|Brian Kay"]}, {"page": "The King's Singers", "response": ["* Brian Kay (bass)", "Prior to the establishment of the original stable male-only group cited above, several of the parts were taken by other singers, including three females. The four founding members, who first sang together within a six-man group in 1965, were Alastair Hume, Alastair Thompson, Simon Carrington and Brian Kay. From 1965 until 1968, the first countertenor was Martin Lane and the first baritone was Richard Salter. It was this group of six singers who gave the first concert under the name of the King's Singers on 1 May 1968 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, with the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Simon Preston (organ) and Barry Tuckwell (horn). Later in 1968, Martin Lane developed a brain tumour and had to withdraw from the group; Felicity Palmer stood in during 1969 until Nigel Perrin graduated that summer. Then, in 1969, Richard Salter was awarded a Richard Tauber Scholarship and left for Vienna; Nigel Beavan filled the gap until Anthony Holt became available towards the end of the year. Other singers who served as short-term group members were Eleanor Capp, Caryl Newnham and, on one occasion, James Bowman, all of whom took the first countertenor (soprano) role in 1969 when Felicity Palmer was unavailable. For a brief time after he joined the King's Singers, Nigel Perrin also belonged to the Scholars; when double-booked, his King's Singers' duties were fulfilled by Richard Baker (note: not the familiar BBC broadcaster). Neil Jenkins sang tenor in the early pre-King's Singers group's first summer singing tour in 1965, and Peter Hall was another tenor used by the fledgling pre-King's Singers group.  ", "Many former members of the King's Singers have remained active in the world of choral music. Former tenor Bob Chilcott is now a composer, conductor of the BBC Singers and workshop leader. Former baritone Gabriel Crouch is now the director of choral ensembles at Princeton University and former countertenor Nigel Short founded a professional choir, Tenebrae, on leaving the group in 2001.
