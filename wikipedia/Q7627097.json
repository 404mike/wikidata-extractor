He was part of the first ever Manx team to participate in the British Empire and Commonwealth Games.Slack participated in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, taking part in the road cycling event.  He finished third in the event, arriving in a five-man group nearly three minutes behind the race winner, Ray Booty winning a Bronze Medal after a photo-finish. In 2011, this result was described as being \"against all expectations\" and was credited with increasing the popularity of cycling in the Isle of Man.Later in his life, Slack published two books about the island. He was also a noted Manx musician and Isle of Man folk songwriter. This including the popular folk song \u2018The Laxey Wheel\u2019 (1957). A number of different recordings of Stuart Slack's folk songs were banned by the local commercial radio station Manx Radio for being too  \"risqu\u00e9.\"Since his death in 1998 there is an annual cycle event in his memory.In 2002, the Isle of Man Post Office issued a set of postage stamps for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester including a 22 pence stamp depicting the photo-finish of Stuart Slack's third-place finish in the Men's Cycling Road race at the 1958 Empire Games.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laxey Wheel", "response": ["The wheel has two pieces of music dedicated to it: one penned by Stuart Slack, and the other by Helen Barley; both are entitled The Laxey Wheel."]}]}}
