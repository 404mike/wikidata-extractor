He was born at Calcutta, India and died at Cowie's Hill, Durban, South Africa.\nDraper was a left-arm medium pace bowler and a tail-end batsman. He opened the Somerset bowling in each of his three matches for the team, and took three wickets in an innings in both of his matches in the 1925 season; however, both Cambridge University and Essex scored more than 400 in the innings where Draper took wickets. His single game in 1929, against Northamptonshire, was not a success: he failed to take a wicket or score a run.Draper's record as a batsman was negligible: he scored 20 runs in four innings. It is not clear whether he batted right- or left-handed. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1988 says left-handed; his Cricketarchive profile says right.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Robert Draper (1925\u20131929) 3 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Robert Draper (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Draper is a writer.", "Robert Draper may also refer to:", "*Robert Draper (cricketer) (1903\u20131987), cricketer for Somerset", "*Robert Draper (MP) (died 1395/6), MP for Bath, England", "*Robert Draper (bishop), Anglican bishop in Ireland", "*Robert Draper, character in Pacific Blackout", "*Robert Draper, singer with The Accents"]}]}}
