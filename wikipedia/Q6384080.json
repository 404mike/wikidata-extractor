Charlton reached the FA Cup final in 2003 but lost 3\u20130 to Fulham. In the following season (2003\u201304) Charlton finished runners-up in the Premier League, just one point behind winners Arsenal, and again reached the F.A. Cup final which they lost to Arsenal. The season did bring success to the club, though, with a victory over Fulham in the final of the League Cup. In 2004\u201305, Charlton won both the Charity Shield (beating Arsenal) and the FA Cup (beating Everton) and once more finished runners up in the league to Arsenal. In 2005\u201306, Charlton regained the League Cup, beating Arsenal in the Final. However, in this season, and also the 2006\u201307 season, Charlton finished third in the league, meaning the club missed the opportunity to participate in the UEFA Cup. In May 2007, Charlton were again runners up in the FA Cup, losing to Arsenal in the final. During these successful years under manager Keith Boanas and assistant Matt Beard, the team included several current and former England internationals, notably club captain Casey Stoney, goalkeeper Pauline Cope, Joanne Broadhurst, Eniola Aluko and Katie Chapman. Aluko and Chapman went on to play professionally in the United States."]}, {"page": "Casey Stoney", "response": ["On 13 March 2010 Stoney announced on Twitter that she had signed for FA WSL rivals Lincoln Ladies to play alongside England stars such as Sue Smith and Jess Clarke.

Cope finished her club career playing for Charlton under the management of partner and future husband Keith Boanas, retiring in 2006.

The quarter final meeting with National Division Everton followed a similar pattern to the earlier win over Birmingham.  A Margunn Haugenes penalty gave Fulham a one-goal advantage at the interval, before a second half increase in tempo saw them depart Merseyside with a 4\u20130 win and their place in the semi finals. During the match with Charlton Athletic at Woking's Kingfield Stadium, Pettersen and Kristy Moore put Fulham two goals ahead in the first half, but Charlton reduced the deficit when Astrid Johannessen allowed Fara Williams' tame free kick through her legs. According to The Guardian report, \"there was always going to come the time to ask a familiar question: how many would Fulham score?\" Pettersen and Moore added another goal each to seal a 4\u20131 win.
