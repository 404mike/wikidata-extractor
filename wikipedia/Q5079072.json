He was the first captain of Surrey County Cricket Club following its formation in late 1845, leading them from 1846 until 1850. During his time as captain Surrey played ten matches against other counties recognised as first-class. Of these they won six, lost two, drew one and one match finished as a tie. In 1850, his last season as captain, they won all four of their first-class inter-county matches. They could thus be considered the \"Champion County\". Surrey also played the All England Eleven that season in a match recognised as first-class even though Surrey had 14 players; the match was drawn, Surrey thus finishing the season unbeaten in first-class fixtures.\nHe was a right-handed batsman of modest achievement. In 36 first-class matches he scored only 507 runs at an average of 9.38. He managed to reach fifty twice, with a highest score of 58. His record considering only his matches for Surrey is substantially better: 17 matches, averaging 12.83. This was at a period when an average in the high teens was very good (for comparison, Fuller Pilch averaged 18.61 and George Parr averaged 20.20). As a bowler he is known to have taken two wickets, but the runs conceded are not recorded.\nHe made his first-class and Surrey debut in 1846 and played for the county until 1853. He played for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) from 1847 until 1854. After 1854 he played in only two more first-class matches, both for the Gentlemen of the South in 1858.\nHe was also Surrey's first treasurer.His brother Henry James Hoare, his father George Matthew Hoare, and his son Charles Twysden Hoare, all played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Hoare", "response": ["Charles Hoare may refer to:", "*Charles Hoare (cricketer, born 1847) (1847\u20131908), English cricketer and banker", "*Charles Hoare (cricketer, born 1851) (1851\u20131935), English cricketer", "*Charles Hoare (cricketer, born 1819) (1819\u20131869), English cricketer", "*Charles Hoare of the Hoare baronets", "*Charles Hoare (priest) (1781\u20131865), evangelical Church of England clergyman, archdeacon of Surrey", "*Charles Hoare (banker) (1767\u20131851), senior partner of C.
