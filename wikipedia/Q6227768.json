He was succeeded by Gordon Thiessen.\nBorn in London, England, he went to Parmiter's School also he served with the Royal Air Force for two years before receiving a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from the University of Oxford in 1961.

Although since that time inflation-targeting has been adopted by \"most advanced-world central banks\", in 1991 it was innovative and Canada was an early adopter when the then-Finance Minister Michael Wilson approved the Bank of Canada's first inflation-targeting in the 1991 federal budget. The inflation target was set at 2 per cent. Inflation is measured by the total consumer price index (CPI). In 2011 the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada extended Canada's inflation-control target to December 31, 2016. The Bank of Canada uses three unconventional instruments to achieve the inflation target: \"a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate\", quantitative easing, and credit easing."]}, {"page": "Jean Chr\u00e9tien", "response": ["In October 1991, Chr\u00e9tien first gave his views about how best to end the recession which had begun in 1990. Chr\u00e9tien argued that the answer was a policy of slow devaluation where the dollar would be allowed to decline against other major world currencies, which would have the effect of both pricing out foreign imports and by giving Canadian firms a competitive advantage in world markets, boost exports.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 p. 46. However, Chr\u00e9tien concluded that his planned export offensive powered by a low dollar would come to nothing if other nations maintained tariffs to keep Canadian goods out of their markets. In order to make his plans to export Canada back into prosperity work, Chr\u00e9tien decided that the solution was globalization. Besides for globalization, Chr\u00e9tien also argued to combat the recession, the federal government needed to make the system of unemployment insurance less generous, and to end the policy of high interest rates maintained by the Bank of Canada Governor John Crow to achieve his target of zero percent inflation, which Chr\u00e9tien argued was needlessly crippling the economy."]}, {"page": "Gordon Thiessen", "response": ["Gordon George Thiessen,  (born August 14, 1938) was the sixth Governor of the Bank of Canada from 1994 to 2001, succeeding John Crow.
