From 1818, when he arranged the cession of the Isles de Los to the British, he started receiving an annual payment from them. Between 1820 and 1841, Dala Modu arranged peace talks on a number of occasions to settle local disputes the Colony Government felt were inhibiting trade. These included the rebellion on the north Rokel in 1835, and the Temne/Loko war in 1836. Though he did not get along well with some of the governors, succeeding ones were quick to realise his worth and do business with him. Governor Henry Dundas Campbell visited him in 1835 and was struck by his intelligence and affluent style of living."]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors of Sierra Leone", "response": ["*Henry Dundas Campbell (February 1835 \u2013 1837)"]}, {"page": "Henry Campbell", "response": ["*Henry Dundas Campbell (c. 1798\u20131872), British army officer and Governor of Sierra Leone"]}, {"page": "Samuel Davis (orientalist)", "response": ["*Anne, who married Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Dundas Campbell in 1827"]}, {"page": "Governor Campbell", "response": ["*Henry Dundas Campbell (1798\u20131872), Governor of Sierra Leone from 1835 to 1837"]}]}}
