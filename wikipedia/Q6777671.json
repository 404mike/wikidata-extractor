On the other hand, the aristocratic clans wanted to prevent the members of other clans from acquiring their estates through marriage with their kinswomen. Consequently, restrictions on a daughter's right to inherit her father's developed during the following centuries. Historian Martyn Rady argues that \"a peculiar reading\" of the Lex Falcidia in the Codex Theodosianus gave most probably rise to the formation of the new legal doctrine. Rady also proposes that churchmen must have played a preeminent role in its development, because they could recall \"fathers to their duties\" and specify their obligations towards their children, although the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts in cases involving real estates was limited."]}, {"page": "Empire of Charles V", "response": ["The organization of ambitious political marriages reflected Maximilian's practice to expand the House of Habsburg with dynastic links rather than conquest, as exemplified by his saying \"Let others wage war, you, happy Austria, marry\".

He saw mercury as the prima materia of alchemy. According to William Lilly, in his dedicatication to Banfi Hunyades in Anglicus, peace, or no peace (1645), the Latin phrase \"Est in Mercurio quicquid quaerunt sapientes\" was Banfi Hunyades' motto,  and the phrase is featured in all of his engraved portraits. An inscription on his portrait describes one such alchemical accomplishment of his, an experiment in which he destroyed gold and silver by way of mercury, reduced the resultant substance into mercury and precipitated the mercury into a red powder. He was clearly proud of the experiment, as it is inscribed on the frame of each of his engraved portraits \u2013 based on a Gowy portrait showing him holding the vessel he used to perform the experiment. This alchemical preoccupation has been criticized with the biographer Reverend James Granger describing him as \"far gone in his philosophical fanaticism\" and Martyn Rady suggests the red powder was probably only oxidized mercury.", "Johannes Banfi Hunyades never published anything during his lifetime, and his entire Nachlass consists of only a few inscriptions, letters and experimental notes surviving from his lifetime. The fact that, through the 20th-century, Anglophone and Hungarian scholars have been able to piece together the life of a relatively obscure Hungarian alchemist from contemporary comments, manuscript notes and municipal records has been described by Martyn Rady as \"a comment on the extent of the archival and literary sources which survive [...] after almost three and a half centuries\"."]}, {"page": "Rady", "response": ["*Martyn Rady (born 1955), British historian"]}]}}
