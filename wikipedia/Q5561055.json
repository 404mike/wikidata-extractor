He was most prolific as an author of stories for British boys' comics for DC Thomson publications.\nHe wrote under several pseudonyms so the extent of his writing may not be entirely clear, but is believed to include Wilson the Wonder Athlete, Alf Tupper and Matt Braddock.\nClive James wrote that he enjoyed the stories of Matt Braddock and Alf Tupper as a boy, without realising at the time that they were intended as fantasy figures for working-class readers.", "link_mentions": []}}
