Three firms: A.V. Roe, Handley-Page and Vickers-Armstrongs submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements.Burnet and Morgan  Aeroplane Monthly August 1980, p. 397. While Short Brothers submitted a design, by Geoffrey T. R. Hill, that was judged too ambitious, the Air Staff accepted another submission from the company for a separate requirement, B.14/46, as \"insurance\" in case the advanced B.35/46 effort ran into trouble. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as \"calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines\"Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 72. Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the S.A.4 Sperrin. Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its maiden flight in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only."]}, {"page": "Roderic Hill", "response": ["Roderic Maxwell Hill was born in Hampstead, London, on 1 March 1894, the eldest of the three children of Michaiah John Muller Hill, professor of mathematics at University College, London, and his wife, Minnie.

Roderic was educated at Bradfield College and,Hammerton, Sir John ABC of the RAF London 1941 p.52 in 1912, went to the fine arts department of University College, London, with the ambition of becoming an architect. From 1909 onwards both he and Geoffrey became fascinated by aviation; with money earned by Roderic from drawings published in The Sphere, they built, and successfully flew, a glider of their own design in 1913."]}, {"page": "Short Sturgeon", "response": ["One TT.2 (VR363), piloted by \"Jock\" Eassie, was briefly utilised as a glider tug in flight tests of the Short SB.1. This experimental \"tailless\" glider, designed by David Keith-Lucas and Professor Geoffrey T. R.

The first towed launch of the SB.1 piloted by Shorts' Chief Test Pilot, Tom Brooke-Smith, took off from RAF Aldergrove on 30 July 1951. The SB.1 was towed behind to a 10,000\u00a0ft altitude with the flight completed successfully.Gunston 1977, p. 512."]}, {"page": "Professor G.T.R. Hill", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey T. R.

The aeroisoclinic wing, developed by Geoffrey T. R. Hill in the 1950s and flown on the Short SB.4 Sherpa, was an attempt control the flexing in such a way as to maintain handling characteristics in all flight regimes. Similar aeroelastic tailoring was later applied to experimental forward-swept wings, where it is a necessity for any safe design."]}, {"page": "NRC tailless glider", "response": ["To research the control and stability of tailless aircraft.
