He thought Martin might be interested in the group, even though they had been turned down by Decca Records. Until that time, although there had been considerable success with comedy records, and a number 1 hit with the Temperance Seven, Martin had only minor success with pop music, such as \"Who Could Be Bluer\" by Jerry Lordan, and singles with Shane Fenton and Matt Monro. After the telephone call by Coleman, Martin arranged a meeting on 13 February 1962 with Brian Epstein. Martin listened to a tape recorded at Decca, and thought that Epstein's group was \"rather unpromising\", but liked the sound of Lennon's and McCartney's vocals."]}, {"page": "1960 in music", "response": ["* \"Apache\" \u2013 m.

Her follow-up single was issued in September, but Jerry Lordan's \"I Will Follow You\" failed to chart. The song that put an end to her one-hit wonder status was found on the album Barry Ryan 3. \"Who Put the Lights Out\", written by Paul Ryan for his twin brother, was offered to her by their stepfather Harold Davison, the business partner of her agent Dick Katz. Her version, cut with Barry Ryan's producer Bill Landis, proved a strong comeback vehicle reaching #5 in Ireland. In the UK it became a #14 hit on 13 March 1971. There then followed three years of unsuccessful singles broken only by the Irish chart showing of \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\", a #4 hit in December 1973.

Saxophonist Benjamin Bossi was added to the lineup as an \"accident\" when Iyall met him while he worked in the New York City Deli on Market Street in San Francisco. The group released their first single, \"White Sweater\", which consisted of the title track and a cover of Jerry Lordan's popular instrumental composition \"Apache\", in February 1981 on a recently founded local label called 415 Records. They worked on the recording of their debut album, It's a Condition, with producer David Kahne. Before recording began, Derrah left the band and was replaced by John \"Stench\" Hanes, who had previously played with Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Romeo Void's debut was critically acclaimed upon its release through 415 in July 1981, and introduced Romeo Void's \"unique blend of jazz, funk, rock and confrontational poetry\".

Subsequently, many of the Incredible Bongo Band's other releases were sampled by hip-hop producers, and the \"Apache\" break also remains a staple of many producers in drum and bass. The song received popular attention again in 2001 when it was featured in an ad for an Acura SUV. In 2008, music critic Will Hermes did an article on \"Apache\" and the Incredible Bongo Band for the New York Times and had an entire documentary devoted to it called \"Sample this\".
