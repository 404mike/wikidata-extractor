James had wanted to follow his father into the church. However, he had a stammer, which he thought held him back in his career. He worked as a bank clerk until he inherited sufficient wealth to marry well and to change career onto the stage, mostly in London. He took the stage name Nutcombe Gould and never stammered on stage.\nIn 1879 he set up 'The Barn Owls' an amateur dramatics group in Lustleigh, Devon.Notably, Gould originated the role of Lord Darlington in Lady Windermere's Fan by Oscar Wilde when it premiered in 1892.In 1895 Gould played Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare.In 1897 Gould played Hamlet in Hamlet by William Shakespeare, directed by Ben Greet.His name appears in the biography of Ellen Terry.", "link_mentions": {}}}
