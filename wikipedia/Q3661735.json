He played an important diplomatic role in sustaining relations between the notoriously difficult Montgomery and his peers and superiors.\nA 1918 graduate of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, de Guingand joined the West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own) in December 1919. He served in India and Ireland, and was seconded to the King's African Rifles  in Nyasaland from 1926 to 1931. Through the intervention of Montgomery, with whom he served in the 1920s and 1930s and formed a friendship, he secured a nomination to 1935\u201336 course at the Staff College, Camberley, in Camberley. He served as Military Assistant to the Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha, from 1939 to 1940, in which role he had exposure to the most senior officers in the army and developed skills in diplomacy.\nAfter Hore-Belisha resigned, de Guingand was posted to the new staff college at Haifa in Mandatory Palestine as an instructor. In December 1940, on the recommendation of the Staff College's Commandant Eric Dorman-Smith, he was posted to the Joint Planning Staff of Middle East Command in Cairo where he also took on the role of secretary to the Commanders-in-Chief Committee. In February 1942 Dorman-Smith, now Deputy Chief of the General Staff at Middle East Command, recommended him for the position of Director of Military Intelligence, Middle East. In this role he was successful, and after the First Battle of El Alamein was appointed the Eighth Army's Brigadier General Staff. When Montgomery assumed command of Eighth Army in August 1942 he became Montgomery's chief of staff. He was promoted acting major-general in May 1943. De Guingand proved indispensable to Montgomery, not only in battle, but also in relations with the Americans.  De Guingand seems to have been blessed with considerable diplomatic skills, which proved useful when serving with Montgomery. He formed a close relationship with Walter Bedell Smith, the chief of staff to Supreme Allied Commander, General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower, and was able to smooth over many difficulties arising from Montgomery's problematic relationships with many of his peers and superiors.\nDe Guingand was on sick leave on several occasions, and only Montgomery's intervention kept the doctors from relieving him. After the end of hostilities in Europe he spent time recuperating but was still not recovered when he was appointed as Director of Military Intelligence (DMI) in September 1945. Montgomery had become aware that he was to succeed Alan Brooke as Chief of the Imperial General Staff in June 1946 and told de Guingand he wanted him as his Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff. However, de Guingand failed to impress Brooke as DMI and as a result the job went to Frank Simpson. De Guingand retired from the army In February 1947 and emigrated to Southern Rhodesia to pursue a career in business, achieving considerable success.  He wrote four books about his experiences:  Operation Victory (1947), African Assignment (1953), Generals at War (1954),  and From Brass Hat to Bowler Hat (1979).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of the Bulge", "response": ["British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery differed from the U.S. command in how to respond to the German attack and his public statements to that effect caused tension in the American high command.

He told them this was to be top secret, that Alexander had been impressed by his visit to Helwan, and that he wanted Camouflage's advice. He introduced Charles Richardson, who worked for Dudley Clarke's secretive 'A' Force and was to implement the deception Montgomery needed. Richardson had not been trained in deception planning, given the accelerated training of staff officers in 1940, nor had he ever prepared a deception plan before. He was determined it should succeed, since, as he wrote, \"if it failed it would do far more damage than having no plan at all\". de Guingand outlined the basic plan: an attack in the north, along the line of the coast road, with a feint some 20 miles to the south. The tanks would take two days to move into battle position from their forming-up positions. Engineering work was already under way. He then astonished them by asking them to hide the hundreds of tanks and field guns, and the thousands of tons of mat\u00e9riel, that were to be used for the decisive attack at El Alamein. Barkas had been hoping for such an opportunity, and now he was being offered the chance to camouflage perhaps the largest desert battle ever attempted."]}, {"page": "German invasion of Greece", "response": ["General Archibald Wavell, the commander of British Army forces in the Middle East, when in Greece from 11 to 13 April had warned Wilson that he must expect no reinforcements and had authorised Major General Freddie de Guingand to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers. Nevertheless, the British could not at this stage adopt or even mention this course of action; the suggestion had to come from the Greek Government. The following day, Papagos made the first move when he suggested to Wilson that W Force be withdrawn. Wilson informed Middle East Headquarters and on 17 April, Rear admiral H. T. Baillie-Grohman was sent to Greece to prepare for the evacuation.  That day Wilson hastened to Athens where he attended a conference with the King, Papagos, d'Albiac and Rear admiral Turle. In the evening, after telling the King that he felt he had failed him in the task entrusted to him, Prime Minister Koryzis committed suicide.  On 21 April, the final decision to evacuate Empire forces to Crete and Egypt was taken and Wavell \u2013 in confirmation of verbal instructions \u2013 sent his written orders to Wilson."]}, {"page": "Douglas Wilmer", "response": ["* Patton (1970) as Major General Freddie de Guingand"]}, {"page": "Francis de Guingand", "response": ["#REDIRECT Freddie de Guingand"]}, {"page": "Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* 1945\u20131946 Freddie de Guingand"]}, {"page": "Francis Guingand", "response": ["#REDIRECT Freddie de Guingand"]}, {"page": "Brian Robertson, 1st Baron Robertson of Oakridge", "response": ["In August 1942, General Harold Alexander replaced Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief Middle East, and Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery became commander of the Eighth Army.

Lieutenant General Sir Wilfrid Lindsell, the Chief Administrative Officer at Middle East HQ had also been one of his instructors. Robertson was happy to go along with Montgomery's organisation of the staff under which the head of the General Staff branch, Major General Freddie de Guingand acted as a chief of staff, controlling both administration and operations. Robertson was still permitted direct access to Montgomery when he requested it, a privilege that he did not exercise often. For his part in the earlier campaigns, Robertson was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in September. \"What gave me confidence,\" he wrote to his wife, \"more than anything else was Monty's attitudes and methods.

Whiteley assumed his new post on 28 March 1942. His time in the post saw British fortunes fall to their lowest ebb, with the disastrous Battle of Gazala and the fall of Tobruk. Auchinleck assumed personal command of the Eighth Army on 25 June, and Whiteley was superseded by Dorman-Smith to some extent. However, Whiteley remained in the job until after the First Battle of El Alamein, when he was replaced by Brigadier Freddie de Guingand.

Richardson was a member of the Royal Engineers and had worked on deception operations in Dudley Clarke's secret 'A' Force. On 17 September 1941, Barkas and Ayrton were called to Eighth Army headquarters, out in the desert near Borg el Arab, between Alexandria and El Alamein. They listened in astonishment as Richardson explained the size of the deception that he was planning. He wanted Rommel to believe that Montgomery would attack in the south, not along the obvious coast road route; and that the attack would not be ready on the night of the full moon, 23 October. This was to be achieved despite the lack of cover in the desert, and the 700 tanks and 400 guns that were to be used in the attack.Forbes, 2009. p164.Stroud, 2012. pp190-192.Crowdy, 2008. pp177-179."]}]}}
