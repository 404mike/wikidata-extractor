February 1746 \u2013 3 May 1825), was a British diplomat and politician who pursued an 'unflagging, though wholly unsuccessful, quest for office' which led King George III of Great Britain to describe him as 'that busy man' and 'the grand intriguer'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ston Easton Park", "response": ["The identity of the architect is not known, and although the design is reminiscent of the work of William Kent modern research tends to suggest Thomas Paty. It is also not known exactly when the house was built. John Hippisley-Coxe died in 1769 and his sons Richard and Henry further embellished the house and grounds. Henry Hippisley-Coxe employed Humphry Repton to  landscape the park, including driveways and a viaduct similar to his plans for Endsleigh Cottage in Devon, although only part of this plan was actually created. Henry's widow Elizabeth Anne Horner, of Mells Manor, and her second husband Sir John Hippisley, 1st Baronet, further developed the grounds in about 1814. Elizabeth lived in the house until her death in 1843. The house was then left to Henry Hippisley of Lambourn, Henry's nephew, whose descendants lived there until the mid-20th century."]}, {"page": "John Cox Hippisley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir John Hippisley, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "John Coxe Hippisley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir John Hippisley, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "John Hippisley", "response": ["*Sir John Hippisley, 1st Baronet (c.1746\u20131825), English MP for Sudbury"]}, {"page": "Sir John Coxe Hippisley, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECTSir John Hippisley, 1st Baronet"]}]}}
