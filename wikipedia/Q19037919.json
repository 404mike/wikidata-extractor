Tilak, a lawyer by training, was also politically active in support of independence. He established and published two dailies\u2014Kesari in Marathi and Mahratta in English; both being published from Pune. In 1894, Professor R. P. Karkaria presented his paper on the Maratha king Shivaji to the Royal Asiatic Society in Bombay. This turned into an annual celebration commemorating the anniversary of Shivaji's coronation. Three years later, Tilak published reports of this celebration, as \"Shivaji's Utterances\"; this essay doubled as an attack on the colonial government. Justice Arthur Strachey, who presided over Tilak's case, widened the understanding of Section 124A. Under Strachey's definition, the attempt to excite \"feelings of enmity\" against government was also a form of sedition. Tilak was found guilty by the jury and sentenced to 18 months of rigorous imprisonment. Tilak again faced charges against sedition for two Kesari articles, titled \"The Country's Misfortune\" (12 May 1908) and \"These Remedies Are Not Lasting\" (9 June 1908). He was again found guilty under the newly drafted section 124A, and sentenced to six years of imprisonment in Burma."]}]}}
