Buildings came increasingly to be designed in an understated style that limited ornament and was based on traditional forms of local vernacular architecture, in Birmingham largely brick, roughcast and half-timbering. Design emphasised the simple and honest expression of the building's construction, highlighting structural elements such as the bonds of the brickwork, and often emphasising differences in the function of elements of the building through the deliberate creation of awkward juxtapositions and contrasts. Buildings often featured decorative elements such as furnishings, friezes or paintings by local artists and craftsmen \u2013 particularly by the Birmingham Group which formed around the Birmingham School of Art in the 1880s \u2013 considering these to be integral to the design of the building to form a \"total work of art\".  The Arts and Crafts philosophy was an approach to design rather than a defined style, however, and the work of Arts and Crafts architects within Birmingham ranged from the eclectic and spectacular Elizabethan revival work of Crouch and Butler to the Methodist purism of Joseph Lancaster Ball; and from the politically radical austerity of Arthur Stansfield Dixon; to the mystically-charged symbolism of the work of William Lethaby."]}, {"page": "Guild of St George", "response": ["Since 1871, some of the Guild's Companions have included: Lord Courtauld-Thomson, W.

Prior had an office in the same building. Through Prior, a former pupil of Richard Norman Shaw, Blomfield met others of Shaw's circle, including Mervyn Macartney, Ernest Newton and Gerald Horsley. Although he never worked in Shaw's office, Blomfield was, like them, henceforth a great admirer of Shaw. With this ground, Blomfield was involved in the founding of the Art Workers Guild and was at first made its Honorary Secretary, but he attended infrequently and when admonished about this, resigned in a huff. In retrospect, however, he paid tribute to these efforts as formative in setting a new direction for architecture: \"I think it is due to these young men of the 80s that the arts were rescued from the paralysing conventions of the Victorian era\". In 1890, with the idea of designing and making fine furniture, Blomfield, Ernest Gimson, Macartney and William Lethaby joined forces to establish Kenton & Co.

During the first school year, Whall taught his classes alone, but by 1897 he had hired Alfred Drury, an experienced glazer to teach the crafts of leading and glazing. Whall's method of teaching, which he called the \"Ruskin method\", taught students to combine close observations and detailed workmanship along with more traditional artistic skills.

Reprint of the 1934 ed. published by the Cambridge University Press, pp. 74, 98 Strzygowski wrote in the Origin of Christian Church Art (1920): \"It is a delight, in a church earlier than AD 1000, to see the builder, the court architect Trdat, carrying Armenian art so logically and so successfully past 'Romanesque' to 'Gothic'.\" Several scholars had proposed this view before Strzygowski. H. F. B. Lynch in his book on Armenia published in 1901 suggested that the cathedral has \"many of the characteristics of the Gothic style, of which it establishes the Oriental origin.\" William Lethaby found the cathedral \"strangely western.\" He wrote in Medieval Art (1912) that it is especially remarkable because its pointed arches, clustered piers, ribs and colonnades correspond to the Gothic of a hundred years later.

Tiles and narrow courses of brick were used in twisted neo-Tudor chimney stacks. Prior did not employ a general contractor in the building. Electrical services were executed under contract, but the main construction work was supervised  and labour and materials purchased by Prior's site clerk, Randall Wells (1877\u20131942) and Mr Blower, a local bricklayer.
