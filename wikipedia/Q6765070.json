In 1923 he organised Oxford Recitations, an annual contest whose purpose was \"to discover good speakers of verse and to encourage 'the beautiful speaking of poetry'.\" Given the numbers of contest applicants, the event's promotion of natural speech in poetical recitations, and the number of people learning how to listen to poetry, Oxford Recitations was generally deemed a success. Masefield was similarly a founding member, in 1924, of the Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse. He later came to question whether the Oxford events should continue as a contest, considering that they might better be run as a festival. However, in 1929, after he broke with the competitive element, Oxford Recitations came to an end. The Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse, on the other hand, continued to develop through the influence of associated figures such as Marion Angus and Hugh MacDiarmid and exists today as the Poetry Association of Scotland."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Marion Angus (1865\u20131946), Scottish poet in Scots"]}, {"page": "Arbroath", "response": ["*Marion Angus (1865\u20131946), poetThe Singing Lass.

As writers such as George Douglas Brown railed against the \"Kailyard school\" that had come to dominate Scottish letters, producing satiric, realist accounts of Scottish rural life in novels like The House with the Green Shutters (1901), Scots language poets such as Violet Jacob and Marion Angus undertook a quiet revival of regionally inflected poetry in the Lowland vernacular. The aforementioned Patrick Geddes would continue his foundational work in town and regional planning, developing the triad \"Place - Work - Folk\" as a matrix for new thinking about the relationships between people and their local environments. In the realm of visual arts, John Duncan would refine his Celtic myth inspired Symbolist painting to include an increasing emphasis on collage and the flatness of the image. In architecture and the decorative arts, the towering figures of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Four would give Scotland its very own \"school\" of modern design and help create the \"Glasgow style\". Scotland in the early 20th century was experiencing an efflorescence of creative activity, but there was not yet a sense of a particular shared movement or an overt national inflection to all of this artistic effort."]}, {"page": "Violet Jacob", "response": ["Violet Jacob was described by Hugh MacDiarmid as \"by far the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets\", a view he did not rescind over a fifty-year period.
