He later wrote that in the spring of 1919 he \"was disappointed when he [Lloyd George] gave way (in part) on the Russian question in order to buy French consent to concessions to Germany\".Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 30 In 1919, Carr was part of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference and was involved in the drafting of parts of the Treaty of Versailles relating to the League of Nations. During the conference, Carr was much offended at the Allied, especially French, treatment of the Germans, writing that the German delegation at the peace conference were \"cheated over the 'Fourteen Points', and subjected to every petty humiliation\". Beside working on the sections of the Versailles treaty relating to the League of Nations, Carr was also involved in working out the borders between Germany and Poland. Initially, Carr favoured Poland, urging in a memo in February 1919 that Britain recognise Poland at once, and that the German city of Danzig (modern Gda\u0144sk, Poland) be ceded to Poland.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 28 In March 1919, Carr fought against the idea of a Minorities Treaty for Poland, arguing that the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in Poland would be best guaranteed by not involving the international community in Polish internal affairs.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 27 By the spring of 1919, Carr's relations with the Polish delegation had declined to a state of mutual hostility.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 29 Carr's tendency to favour the claims of the Germans at the expense of the Poles led Adam Zamoyski to note that Carr \"held views of the most extraordinary racial arrogance on all of the nations of Eastern Europe\".Zamoyski, Adam The Polish Way, London: John Murray, 1989 p. 335 Carr's biographer, Jonathan Haslam, wrote that Carr grew up in a place where German culture was deeply appreciated, which in turn always coloured his views towards Germany throughout his life. As a result, Carr supported the territorial claims of the Reich against Poland. In a letter written in 1954 to his friend Isaac Deutscher, Carr described his attitude to Poland at the time: \"The picture of Poland that was universal in Eastern Europe right down to 1925 was of a strong and potentially predatory power.\"", "In May\u2013June 1951, Carr delivered a series of speeches on British radio entitled The New Society, that advocated a commitment to mass democracy, egalitarian democracy, and \"public control and planning\" of the economy.Davies, \"Edward Hallett Carr\", p. 490 Carr was a reclusive man whom few knew well, but his circle of close friends included Isaac Deutscher, A.
