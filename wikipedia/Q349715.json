Rather than maintain the title of \"king\" ( w\u00e1ng) borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers, he ruled as the First Emperor () of the Qin dynasty from 221 to 210 BCE. His self-invented title \"emperor\" ( ) would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia. Historically, he was often portrayed as a tyrannical ruler and strict Legalist, in part from the Han dynasty's scathing assessments of him. Since the mid 20th-century, scholars have begun to question this evaluation, inciting considerable discussion on the actual nature of his policies and reforms. Regardless, according to sinologist Michael Loewe \"few would contest the view that the achievements of his reign have exercised a paramount influence on the whole of China's subsequent history, marking the start of an epoch that closed in 1911\"."]}, {"page": "Legalism (Chinese philosophy)", "response": ["The Discourses on Salt and Irons Lord Grand Secretary uses Shang Yang in his argument against the dispersion of the people, stating that \"a Sage cannot order things as he wishes in an age of anarchy\".

By at least the Han Dynasty (202 BC\u00a0\u2013 220 AD), the Chinese used deep borehole drilling for mining and other projects. The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe states that borehole sites could reach as deep as 600\u00a0m (2000\u00a0ft).Loewe (1968), 194. K.S. Tom describes the drilling process: \"The Chinese method of deep drilling was accomplished by a team of men jumping on and off a beam to impact the drilling bit while the boring tool was rotated by buffalo and oxen.\"Tom (1989), 103. This was the same method used for extracting petroleum in California during the 1860s (i.e. \"Kicking Her Down\"). A Western Han Dynasty bronze foundry discovered in Xinglong, Hebei had nearby mining shafts which reached depths of 100\u00a0m (328\u00a0ft) with spacious mining areas; the shafts and rooms were complete with a timber frame, ladders and iron tools.Loewe (1968), 191.Wang (1982), 105. By the first century BC, Chinese craftsmen cast iron drill bits and drillers were able to drill boreholes up to 4800 feet (1500 m) deep. By the eleventh century AD, the Chinese were able to drill boreholes up to 3000 feet in depth. Drilling for boreholes was time-consuming and long. As the depth of the holes varied, the drilling of a single well could last nearly one full decade.Tom (1989), 103. It wasn't up until the 19th century that Europe and the West would catch up and rival ancient Chinese borehole drilling technology."]}, {"page": "Emperor Wu of Han", "response": ["Emperor Wu is considered one of the greatest emperors in Chinese history due to his strong leadership and effective governance, which made the Han dynasty one of the most powerful nations in the world. Michael Loewe called the reign of Emperor Wu the \"high point\" of \"Modernist\" (classically justified Legalist) policies, looking back to \"adapt ideas from the pre-Han period.\" His policies and most trusted advisers were Legalist, favouring adherents of Shang Yang. However, despite establishing an autocratic and centralised state, Emperor Wu adopted the principles of Confucianism as the state philosophy and code of ethics for his empire and started a school to teach future administrators the Confucian classics. These reforms had an enduring effect throughout the existence of imperial China and an enormous influence on neighbouring civilizations."]}]}}
