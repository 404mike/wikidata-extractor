No. 62 Squadron was one of the last two Bristol F.2 Fighter squadrons to serve at the Western Front, the other being No. 88 Squadron. The aircraft of both squadrons often escorted de Havilland planes on bombing missions.

The Squadron's victories came at a high price as 28 of its aviators were killed in action and three killed in accidents. In addition, 32 aviators became prisoners of war, 22 were wounded in action, and eleven sustained accidental injuries. This does not compare favorably with No. 88 Squadron, the last Bristol Fighter unit to reach the front. While that squadron was credited with 147 enemy aircraft destroyed, it only had two aviators killed, five wounded, and ten reported missing."]}, {"page": "List of World War I aces credited with 9 victories", "response": ["| Charles Arnison"]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Charles Arnison"]}, {"page": "Arnison", "response": ["*Charles Arnison (1893\u20131974), British WWI flying ace"]}, {"page": "Arnison, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Arnison"]}]}}
