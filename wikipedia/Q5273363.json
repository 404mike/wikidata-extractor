He joined the professional ranks at the club in 1963 and went on to play 39 League games in six years with The Baggies. He moved back to his home city of Bristol in 1969 to join Bristol Rovers, and made 150 League appearances before suffering a skull fracture in January 1973 in a match against Tranmere Rovers at Eastville Stadium.\nIt was eleven months before he was to play again, when he joined Torquay United on loan in December 1973 in a deal that was set up in a roadside meeting between Rovers and Torquay near Bridgwater. He played just two games for Torquay, and it was a further year before he finally made it back into the Bristol Rovers lineup. His only appearance for The Pirates after breaking his skull came against Bristol City in December 1974, and after conceding four goals in the second half his professional career came to an abrupt end. Although he was sent out on loan to Fulham later in the season he never played in the Football League again.\nIn the summer of 1975, Sheppard joined non-League side Weymouth, where he spent a year, followed by a further year back in Bristol with Portway Bristol. He moved to Paulton Rovers in 1977, and in January 1980 became the goalkeeping coach for his former club Bristol Rovers. He died in 1998 at the age of 53.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1998\u201399 in English football", "response": ["*18 October 1998: Dick Sheppard, 53, played 39 league games in goal for West Bromwich Albion during the 1960s before a six-year spell at Bristol Rovers which yielded 151 league appearances.

Bristol Rovers won the match 2\u20130, but the occasion was overshadowed by a serious injury to their goalkeeper Dick Sheppard who was carried off by ambulancemen following a collision with Tranmere's Eddie Loyden during the first half. After this the game became a bad tempered affair with the Rovers players aggrieved that Loyden hadn't been sent off, leading to numerous heavy tackles and confrontations between the two teams. It was later revealed that Sheppard had suffered a depressed fracture of the skull in the game, effectively ending his professional career.Jay & Byrne (1994), pp.235\u2013236", "In December 1973 Jarman was in the Newport side that faced Torquay United in a Division Four match at Plainmoor. In goal for the Devon side that day was Jarman's friend and former teammate Dick Sheppard, who was on loan from Bristol Rovers and attempting to make a comeback after being so seriously injured eleven months earlier in Jarman's 500th match. Late in the game Sheppard conceded a penalty, which Jarman stepped up to take and scored.Jay & Haddrell (2014), pp.153\u2013154 The goal was little more than a consolation for Newport however as they still lost 3\u20132.
