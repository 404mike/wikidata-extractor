Standing on top of the gasometer, Harold Perrin, secretary of the Royal Aero Club, waved a flag to indicate the start of Grahame-White's attempt.  By 5:35\u00a0am the aviator was over Watford, and at 6:15\u00a0am he flew over Leighton Buzzard.

Meanwhile, Perrin and two mechanics from Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne (who supplied the engine used on the Farman III) boarded one of two cars, and were headed for Rugby.
