Sharing the genius of his counterpart, he has devised uses for electrical force, categorized the sciences, and speculated as to whether light has a speed.", "According to Peter David, who is writing a Marvel 1602 miniseries about the Four, Gaiman describes Sir Richard as even more pedantic than the mainstream Mr. Fantastic. During a trip to Atlantis, Richard Reed had trouble accepting the idea that the Atlanteans had a connection to Poseidon or their brief encounter with the Watcher, until Susan helped him realise that just because such things could not be understood by their present standards did not mean that humanity could not come to understand them later."]}, {"page": "Mirfield", "response": ["*Richard Reed, co-founder of Innocent Drinks"]}, {"page": "Richard Reid (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Richard Reed (born 1973), British businessman"]}, {"page": "Batley Grammar School", "response": ["*Richard Reed, co-founder of innocent Drinks"]}, {"page": "Innocent Drinks", "response": ["Innocent Drinks was founded by three Cambridge University graduates: Richard Reed, Adam Balon and Jon Wright, then working in consulting and advertising.

People were asked to put their empty bottles in a \"yes\" or \"no\" bin depending on whether they thought the three should quit their jobs to make smoothies. At the end of the festival the \"yes\" bin was full, with only three cups in the \"no\" bin, so they went to their work the next day and resigned. After quitting their jobs, the three struggled to find investment, but eventually had a lucky break when Maurice Pinto, a wealthy American businessman, decided to invest \u00a3250,000.
