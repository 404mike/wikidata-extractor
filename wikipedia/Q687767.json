It was reinstated in the paperback and American editions, with an explanatory preface. Hitchens elaborated that the morality of homosexuality itself was tangential to his main argument. He wrote that British society's unwillingness to criticize sexual promiscuity among gay, bisexual, and straight men alike despite the ill after-effects stands in direct hypocritical contrast to government action against drug use. (In this chapter, Hitchens wrote \"Welsh secretary Ron Davies and agriculture minister Ron Brown were also revealed to be homosexual\"; the agricultural minister at the time was actually Nick Brown.
