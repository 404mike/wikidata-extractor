He was a good batsman and a useful bowler.\nWilliam Bedster was famously the Earl of Tankerville\u2019s butler.  He had 62 known first-class appearances from 1777 to 1794.  He played mainly for Surrey till 1787 but he was frequently used as a \"given man\" elsewhere. \nIt is true that he was at one time Tankerville\u2019s butler at Mount Felix, Walton-on-Thames.  He subsequently moved to Chelsea, where he was an innkeeper, and in his later career played mostly for Middlesex. \nIt is believed he died in 1805 but very little is known of his personal details.", "link_mentions": {}}}
