He was a good batsman and a useful bowler.\nWilliam Bedster was famously the Earl of Tankerville\u2019s butler.  He had 62 known first-class appearances from 1777 to 1794.  He played mainly for Surrey till 1787 but he was frequently used as a \"given man\" elsewhere. \nIt is true that he was at one time Tankerville\u2019s butler at Mount Felix, Walton-on-Thames.  He subsequently moved to Chelsea, where he was an innkeeper, and in his later career played mostly for Middlesex. \nIt is believed he died in 1805 but very little is known of his personal details.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "White Conduit Club", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" | In this game, White Conduit combined with Moulsey Hurst Club in order to take on Hornchurch.

He was the employer of Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens, who was a gardener at Tankerville's Walton-on-Thames estate; and William Bedster, who was his butler. It was the accuracy of \"Lumpy\" Stevens that led to the introduction of a middle stump. Prior to 1776 there were only two stumps and Lumpy's deliveries could go through the hole.

The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three \"given men\" (i.e., borrowed players), on each side the match is also called Duke of Dorset's XI versus Sir Horatio Mann's XI after the two team patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann. The \"East Kent\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire. The \"West Kent\" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players Noah Mann and Tom Sueter with the Chertsey and Surrey players William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens. Noted Kent players involved in the match include Joseph Miller, William Bullen, William Bowra, Robert Clifford and Thomas Pattenden.Haygarth, pp. 47\u201348.

The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex.
