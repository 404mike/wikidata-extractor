Chetan Chauhan, India's team manager said his players were \"agitated and upset by... the incompetent umpires here... [and hoped] that they will not officiate again in the series\". Ponting was questioned over the wrong decision, the racism row, and especially the wicket of Ganguly during which he held his finger up to indicate to Mark Benson that Ganguly has been caught. Ponting was aggressive towards the Indian journalists, lashing out at them for \"questioning my [Ponting's] integrity\". The Australian players faced much questioning as a result of the fallout of the incident. The Australian team maintained that they play hard but fair. In regards to the racism issue, Ponting denied he did anything wrong by singularly reporting Harbhajan Singh for being abusive. Ponting stated that he was obligated to refer any incidents of racism to officials as it is widely agreed that racism is unacceptable anywhere in the world. After criticism of the Australian team in multiple media continued, a shocked Ponting promised to ensure that his side's conduct is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. Peter Roebuck, a columnist in The Sydney Morning Herald, branded Ponting as \"arrogant\" and insisted that be stripped of the captaincy."]}, {"page": "Doosra", "response": ["The doosra of Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad, on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Mark Benson, and TV umpire Mahbubur Rahman after the second Test between India and Bangladesh at Chittagong in December 2004.
