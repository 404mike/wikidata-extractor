After following on, Minor Counties won the match by 42 runs, thanks largely to 154 by Aaron Lockett, a batsman from Staffordshire (and later a first-class umpire) and six wickets for Edward Hazelton of Buckinghamshire."]}, {"page": "Staffordshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Staffordshire has won the National Counties Championship 11 times, more than any other county. It won the title outright in 1906, 1908, 1911, 1920, 1921, 1927, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998 and 2014. The 1914 title was disputed as the war prevented several matches from being played, and is regarded by the NCCA as void. Staffordshire's years of great success before and after the First World War were in part due to the great bowler, Sydney Barnes, who played for the county from 1904 to 1914 and from 1924 to 1934 (when he was 61). He took 1,441 wickets at an average of 8.15 runs each. However, Barnes did not play for the county in 1920 or 1921, two of Staffordshire's title-winning seasons. The leading player then was Aaron Lockett. The most recent title in 2014 was won after a play-off final against the Western Division league leaders, Wiltshire, at the South Wilts Sports Club ground in Salisbury. Staffordshire has won the NCCA Knockout Trophy twice (1991 and 1993) since its inception in 1983."]}, {"page": "Lockett", "response": ["* Aaron Lockett, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1919\u201320 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Back in the Second Division, the club faced a battle to register their players in time for the nine-hour trip to South Shields, where they lost 2\u20130. Two defeats to eventual champions Tottenham Hotspur followed, before the club scored their first goal, and picked up their first win against South Shields on 10 November thanks to an Aaron Lockett strike. The club signed Bobby Blood from Leek United for \u00a350 in order to bolster their strike force, the player had one leg shorter than the other and was riddled with bullets from his valiant efforts in the First World War, and yet he would still prove the doctors wrong who said he would never play football again. The win against South Shields initiated a run of three wins in five games. However this was followed by a streak of seven games without victory. Vale had settled in the league by January, and went into the derby with Stoke in March having lost just one of their previous eight games. This included a 4\u20130 win over Rotherham County which saw Blood score all four, and a 4\u20131 win over Nottingham Forest in which Blood claimed a hat-trick. Stoke dispatched the Vale 3\u20130 in front of the biggest home crowd of the season, the first ever encounter between the two clubs in the Football League.
