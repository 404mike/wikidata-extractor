Dr. Ghillean Prance, director of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, designed the rainforest biome inside the Biosphere. Although he later changed his opinion, acknowledging the unique scope of this experiment and contributed to its success as a consultant, in a 1983 interview (8 years before the start of the experiment), Prance said, \"I was attracted to the Institute of Ecotechnics because funds for research were being cut and the institute seemed to have a lot of money which it was willing to spend freely. Along with others, I was ill-used. Their interest in science is not genuine. They seem to have some sort of secret agenda, they seem to be guided by some sort of religious or philosophical system.\" Prance went on in the 1991 newspaper interview to say \"they are visionaries\u00a0... And maybe to fulfill their vision they have become somewhat cultlike. But they are not a cult, per se\u00a0... I am interested in ecological restoration systems. And I think all sorts of scientific things can come of this experiment, far beyond the space goal\u00a0...

It is the largest waterlily in the world.  V. amazonica is native to the shallow waters of the Amazon River basin, such as oxbow lakes and bayous. In their native habitat, the flowers first begin to open as the sun starts to set and can take up to 48 hours to fully open. These flowers can grow up to 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) in diameter. Each plant will continue to produce flowers for a full growing season and they have co-evolved with a species of scarab beetle of the genus Cyclocephala, to improve its pollination, developing a commensal relationship with such species.  All the buds in a single patch will begin to open at the same time and as they do, they give off a fruity smell. At this point the flower petals are white and the beetles become attracted to both the colour and the smell of the flower. By nightfall the flower closes, the odor stops being emitted, and the beetle becomes trapped inside the carpellary appendages inside the flower. Here, the stamens are protected by the paracarpels and for the next day the flower continues to remain closed. The cavity in which the beetle is trapped is composed of a spongy, starchy tissue that provides nourishment for the beetle. During this time, anthocyanins start to be released by the plant, which in turn changes the petals from white to a reddish pink colour, a sign that the flower will have been pollinated. As the beetle munches away inside the flower, the stamens fall inward and the anthers, which have already fallen, drop pollen on the stamens. During the evening of the second day, the flowers will have opened enough to release the beetle and as it pushes its way through the stamens it becomes covered in pollen. These insects will then go on to find a newly opened water lily and cross-pollinate it with the pollen they are carrying from the previous flower. This process was described in detail by Sir Ghillean Prance and Jorge Arius.  The stem and underside of the leaves are coated with many small spines to defend itself from fish and other herbivores that dwell underwater, although they can also play an offensive role in crushing rival plants in the vicinity as the lily aggressively seeks and hogs sunlight, depriving other plants directly beneath its leaves of such vital resource and significantly darkening the waters below.  Younger giant water lilies are even known to swing their spiny stalks and buds around as they grow to forcibly make space for themselves."]}, {"page": "Brittonia (journal)", "response": ["Scientists who have published in the journal include Frank Almeda, Arne Anderberg, Fred Rogers Barrie, Dennis Eugene Breedlove, Brian Boom, Sherwin Carlquist, Armando Carlos Cervi, Alain Chautems, Thomas Bernard Croat, Arthur Cronquist, Thomas Franklin Daniel, Otto Degener, Laurence Dorr, Robert Louis Dressler, Lynn Gillespie, Peter Goldblatt, Jean-Jacques de Granville, Walter Stephen Judd, Ellsworth Paine Killip, Robert Merrill King, Gwilym Lewis, Bassett Maguire, Lucinda McDade, John McNeill, Elmer Drew Merrill, Scott Alan Mori, Jos\u00e9 Panero, Timothy Plowman, Ghillean Prance, Peter Raven, Harold E.
