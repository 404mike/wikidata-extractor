Much of the difference stemmed from Zukofsky's insistence on form over content, which conflicted with many of the other poets' concern with the real world.

Critical reception from Oliphant's contemporaries is divided as well. Among those who were not in favour of Oliphant was John Skelton, who took the view that Oliphant wrote too much and too fast. Writing a Blackwood's article called \"A Little Chat About Mrs. Oliphant\", he asked, \"Had Mrs. Oliphant concentrated her powers, what might she not have done? We might have had another Charlotte Bront\u00eb or another George Eliot.\" Not all of the contemporary reception was negative, though. M. R.

The first issue Louis Silverstein's H.D. Chronology featured articles by Mary Butts, Murray Constantine, H. D., Havelock Ellis, Kenneth Macpherson, Lotte Reiniger, and Gertrude Stein, besides contributions by Sergei M. Eisenstein, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Horace Gregory, Osbert Sitwell and Eric Walter White. White's essay was probably the first substantial critique of Bertolt Brecht published in English. It continued to publish major figures, including Henry Miller and Dylan Thomas and was the first British magazine to publish emerging young American poets such as Elizabeth Bishop and Muriel Rukeyser. Life and Letters To-day was not a typical modernist \"little magazine\". The initial circulation as a quarterly was nearly 3000 per issue, and the magazine was stocked by major retailers such as W.H. Smith and Menzies. When the title switched to monthly publication in autumn 1938, Smith's alone increased their order by 1000 copies an issue. In March 1939 Brendin purchased the failing London Mercury and Bookman titles and incorporated them to the journal.
