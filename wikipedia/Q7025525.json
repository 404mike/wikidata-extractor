This work resulted from following the fate of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) telomeres after introdroducing fission yeast chromosomes into mouse cell in collaboration with Peter Fantes. In 1989 he took a position as an independent visiting scientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) for 18 months before joining the MRC Human Genetics Unit as a junior group leader. While at CSHL he decided to switch his focus to investigating chromosomal elements in the genetically tractable fission yeast. At the MRC HGU, Edinburgh (1990 - 2002), and subsequently at the Wellome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh (2002\u2013present), he discovered that genes are silenced when placed within fission yeast centromeres and telomeres, and then utilised this gene silencing to gain fundamental insights into the processes of chromosome segregation, and heterochromatin and kinetochore CENP-A chromatin establishment and maintenance. He is particularly interested in the epigenetic mechanisms that allow the persistence of specialised chromatin domains through multiple cell divisions and meiosis. He has investigated how RNA interference (RNAi) mediates heterochromatin formation and shown that splicing factors contribute to heterochromatin integrity via siRNA generation and RNAi.  He has provided insight into how transcription and resulting non-coding RNA might influence the assembly of specialised CENP-A chromatin and demonstrated that some acts of lncRNA transcription are responsive to environmental stimuli and regulate neighbouring genes by transcriptional interference.  Recently using fission yeast his team discovered an epigenetic mechanism that allows fungi to develop resistance to antifungal drugs without alterations to their DNA. This finding is important for understanding how pathogenic fungi become resistant to the limited number of available antifungal agents in both clinical and agricultural arenas."]}]}}
