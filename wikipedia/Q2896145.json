His shop was located at 19 Brewer Street, Piccadilly. Leadbeater employed many naturalists around the world and supplied specimens to museums. By 1824, his business was known as \"Leadbetter & Son\" and, by 1838, it was called \"John Leadbetter\". Around 1858, the business had returned to the name \"Leadbetter & Son\".\nSeveral species are named in his honour, including the southern ground-hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), Major Mitchell's cockatoo (Lophochroa leadbeateri) and violet-fronted brilliant (Heliodoxa leadbeateri). He described Lady Amherst's pheasant, Chrysolophus amherstiae, in 1829.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Major Mitchell's cockatoo", "response": ["Irish naturalist Nicholas Aylward Vigors described the species in 1831 as Plyctolophus leadbeateri. The scientific name commemorates the London naturalist and taxidermist Benjamin Leadbeater, who had given Vigors what would become the type specimen. Edward Lear painted it in his 1832 work Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots. Citing Lear, William Swainson gave it the name Plyctolophus erythropterus."]}, {"page": "Baudin's black cockatoo", "response": ["Baudin's black cockatoo was depicted in 1832 by the English artist Edward Lear in his Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots from a specimen owned by the naturalist Benjamin Leadbeater. Lear used the common name \"Baudin's cockatoo\" and coined the binomial name Calyptorhynchus baudinii. The common name and specific epithet commemorate the French explorer Nicolas Baudin who led of an expedition to Australia in 1801-1804.

He produced 175 copies for sale to subscribers as a part-publication, which were later bound as a book. Lear started painting parrots in 1830 when he was 18 years old, and to get material for his book he studied live birds at the London Zoo and in private collections. The latter included those of Edward Smith Stanley, later 13th Earl of Derby, who had a large menagerie at Knowsley Hall, and Benjamin Leadbeater, a taxidermist and trader in specimens. Lear drew onto lithographic plates for printing by Charles Joseph Hullmandel, who was known for the quality of his reproductions of fine art.", "Lear's early sketchbooks include sketches and drawings of parrots, including a citron-crested cockatoo, a watercolour of two green parrots, and another of a blue macaw's head with two of its feathers, but for his project he needed access to live birds. In June\u00a01830 he was given permission by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) to sketch at London Zoo, and he also had access to the zoo's museum in nearby Bruton Street. As well as skins and stuffed birds, the museum also had aviaries with some live birds. Although other artists were not granted similar access, Lear was introduced to the ZSL by the well-connected Mrs Wentworth, who was interested in both art and natural history.Uglow (2017) p. 39.Uglow (2017) pp. 67\u201368. He also painted parrots owned by Stanley and Vigors, and saw several species, including Baudin's black cockatoo, in the collection of Benjamin Leadbeater, a taxidermist and trader in specimens.Taylor (2012) p. 137.
