He was never short of portrait commissions to work on and throughout the 1920s often earned \u00a335,000 per year and could easily charge 2,000 guineas for a picture. Throughout the 1920s he exhibited at the Royal Academy each year and maintained homes and studios in both London and Paris, where he lived with Aubicq. Orpen continued to drink heavily and although he was separated from his wife, they never divorced. Eventually, he and Aubicq separated and she later married William Grover-Williams, Orpen's former chauffeur. His 1921 Royal Academy submission was a portrait of the head chef at the Hotel Chatham in Paris. The Tate Gallery were keen to acquire the painting using funds from the Chantrey Bequest. After Orpen assured the Tate that the picture met the conditions required by the Bequest and that he had painted the picture entirely in Britain, the Tate announced the purchase. Several people then came forward to say that they had seen Orpen paint the picture in Paris. Orpen withdrew from the purchase and gave the Tate a portrait of Sir William Symington McCormick instead. Orpen subsequently submitted Le Chef de l'Hotel Chatham, Paris to the Royal Academy as his diploma painting."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["** Sir William Symington McCormick (1 March)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| William Symington McCormick||21/06/1928||30 April 1859 \u2013 23 March 1930 Statute "]}, {"page": "William McCormick", "response": ["* William Symington McCormick (1859\u20131930), Scottish-born scholar and educational administrator"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1928", "response": ["*Sir William Symington McCormick"]}, {"page": "1929 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Sir William Symington McCormick  Chairman of the University Grants Committee and of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research."]}, {"page": "Sir William McCormick", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Symington McCormick"]}]}}
