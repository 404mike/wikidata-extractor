He was born in Annesley, Nottinghamshire and died at Nottingham General Hospital, Nottingham.\nFrom a mining background, Barratt was a right-arm fast bowler who, according to Wisden, combined \"swerve with his pace\". He was also a right-handed lower-order batsman whose batting was always forthright, but became suddenly quite proficient from 1928 onwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Underarm bowling", "response": ["Bowlers have employed underarm bowling for a variety of reasons. When the Trinidadian cricketer Syed Mubarak Ali was no-balled 30 times for throwing in a match against Barbados in 1942, he resorted to simply rolling the ball along the ground to avoid more no-balls. In similar circumstances, South African bowler Geoff Griffin did the same in an exhibition match that followed the Test against England at Lord's in 1960, where he had already been no-balled. As rain threatened to end the match between Victoria and MCC in 1928\u201329, the MCC bowler Fred Barratt rolled the ball along the ground to allow Bill Woodfull to score a four to complete his hundred and Victoria to win.

The 63, which contained 11 fours, was his highest first-class score. He was less successful in later games and returned to the middle of the batting order.
