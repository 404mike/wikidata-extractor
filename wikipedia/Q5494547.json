He was born in Annesley, Nottinghamshire and died at Nottingham General Hospital, Nottingham.\nFrom a mining background, Barratt was a right-arm fast bowler who, according to Wisden, combined \"swerve with his pace\". He was also a right-handed lower-order batsman whose batting was always forthright, but became suddenly quite proficient from 1928 onwards.", "link_mentions": {}}}
