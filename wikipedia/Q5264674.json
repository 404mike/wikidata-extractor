He was the co-founder and original manager of the pioneering BBC Radiophonic Workshop.\nBorn in Birkenhead, and a drama studio manager for the BBC in the 1950s, Briscoe began to develop an interest in the use of electronic and electroacoustic techniques as a source of material for productions. Along with Daphne Oram, he worked on the BBC Radio production of Samuel Beckett\u2019s All That Fall (tx:13 January 1957), Giles Cooper's The Disagreeable Oyster (tx:15 August 1957), and Frederick Bradnum's Private Dreams and Public Nightmares (tx:7 October 1957). These works featured some of the earliest electronic effects used by the BBC and highlighted the need for a facility to provide such material.\nIn 1958, Briscoe and Oram founded the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with a remit to provide material for use in BBC radio and television programmes. Some of his first work with the workshop involved providing sounds for the science-fiction serial Quatermass and the Pit (1958\u201359).To coincide with the opening of BBC Television Centre in 1960, his electronic arrangement of Eric Coates' Television March replaced the orchestral arrangement for the introduction to the 2.00pm BBC News bulletin. This was not met with universal approval, being described as \"Orwellian\" by one correspondent to the Radio Times, but it brought their work to wider notice on BBC Television.Under his direction the Workshop grew from being a small back room department to being one of the most acclaimed electronic studios in the world. He remained with the Workshop until 1983, although he stepped back from organisation duties in 1977. In 1983, with Roy Curtis-Bramwell, he wrote a retrospective of the Workshop entitled The First 25 Years: The BBC Radiophonic Workshop.\nThe 1969 BBC album Narrow Boats - Voices, Sounds and Songs of the Canals (REB 56M) was arranged and produced by Desmond Briscoe, and edited by Dick Mills of the Radiophonic Workshop, using recordings from the BBC Sound Archive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC Radiophonic Workshop", "response": ["The Workshop was set up to satisfy the growing demand in the late 1950s for \"radiophonic\" sounds from a group of producers and studio managers at the BBC, including Desmond Briscoe, Daphne Oram, Donald McWhinnie, and Frederick Bradnum.John Tydeman, \"Frederick Bradnum, Master dramatist whose prolific output sustained radio's great era\" in The Guardian dated 22 February 2002An Electric Storm, Ned Netherwood, Obverse Books, Chapter 1 For some time there had been much interest in producing innovative music and sounds to go with the pioneering programming of the era, in particular the dramatic output of the BBC Third Programme. Often the sounds required for the atmosphere that programme makers wished to create were unavailable or non-existent through traditional sources and so some, such as the musically trained Oram, would look to new techniques to produce effects and music for their pieces. Much of this interest drew them to musique concr\u00e8te and tape manipulation techniques, since using these methods could allow them to create soundscapes suitable for the growing range of unconventional programming. When the BBC noticed the rising popularity of this method they established a Radiophonic Effects Committee, setting up the Workshop in rooms 13 & 14 of the BBC's Maida Vale studios with a budget of \u00a32,000. The Workshop contributed articlesRediscovering the era of the Radiophonic Workshop \u2013 BBC \u2013 Research and Development \"the workshop team did not publish its own journals, but had, through the years, contributed a number of articles to magazines such as Practical Electronics, Studio Sound and the Dr. Who Magazine\" to magazines of their findings, leading to some of their techniques being borrowed by sixties producers and engineers such as Eddie Kramer.", "In 1957, Daphne Oram set up the Radiophonic Workshop with Desmond Briscoe, who was appointed the Senior Studio Manager with Dick Mills employed as a technical assistant. Much of The Radiophonic Workshop's early work was in effects for radio, in particular experimental drama and \"radiophonic poems\". Their significant early output included creating effects for the popular science-fiction serial Quatermass and the Pit and memorable comedy sounds for The Goon Show. In 1959, Daphne Oram left the workshop to set up her own studio, the Oramics Studios for Electronic Composition, where she eventually developed her \"Oramics\" technique of electronic sound creation. That year Maddalena Fagandini joined the workshop from the BBC's Italian Service.", "In 1977, Workshop co-founder Desmond Briscoe retired from organisational duties with Brian Hodgson, returning after a five-year gap away from the Workshop, taking over.", "*Desmond Briscoe (1958\u20131983)", "*A Wall Walks Slowly (produced by Desmond Briscoe with music by Peter Howell) (1977)", "**Quatermass and the Pit (effects by Desmond Briscoe & (uncredited) Dick Mills) (1958)"]}, {"page": "Daphne Oram", "response": ["In the 1950s, she was promoted to become a music studio manager. Following a trip to the RTF studios in Paris, she began to campaign for the BBC to provide electronic music facilities for composing sounds and music, using electronic music and musique concr\u00e8te techniques, for use in its programming. In 1957 she was commissioned to compose music for the play Amphitryon 38.  She created this piece using a sine wave oscillator, a tape recorder and some self-designed filters, thereby producing the first wholly electronic score in BBC history. Along with fellow electronic musician and BBC colleague Desmond Briscoe, she began to receive commissions for many other works, including a significant production of Samuel Beckett's All That Fall (1957). As demand grew for these electronic sounds, the BBC gave Oram and Briscoe a budget to establish the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in early 1958, where she was the first Studio Manager. The workshop was focused on creating sound effects and theme music for all of the corporation's output, including the science fiction serial Quatermass and the Pit (1958\u201359) and \"Major Bloodnok's Stomach\" for the radio comedy series The Goon Show."]}, {"page": "Birkenhead", "response": ["There are several musicians linked to the area.

It demonstrates the move from the musique concr\u00e8te and tape-manipulation techniques used in the early days, to the synthesiser works of the 1970s. The first side of the album consisted of material from 1958 to 1971, covering their early work creating jingles, sound-effects and some incidental music. This side includes the first material by Workshop founder Desmond Briscoe to be commercially released, as well as sound effects from The Goon Show, Maddalena Fagandini's interval signal that later became \"Time Beat\", some of Delia Derbyshire's experimental work and the pilot episode version of the Doctor Who theme music.
