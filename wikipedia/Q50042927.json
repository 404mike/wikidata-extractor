The earliest known examples, which date back to the 10th century AD, have been linked to Indo-European root words for snow, rain, or washing, but a direct connection is purely speculative. According to the British toponymist and medieval scholar Victor Watts, \"The name is certainly pre-English, possibly pre-Celtic'.

In the 12th century the principal settlement in Bishopside was at Wilsill, rather than Pateley. Pateley was first recorded in 1175 (though the document survives in a later copy), as Patleiagate, with 14th century forms including Patheleybrig(ge). The final elements are clear, deriving from Old Norse gata ('street') and the northern dialect form brig ('bridge') respectively. There is more debate about the Pateley section of the name: the usual explanation is Old English p\u00e6\u00fe ('path') in the genitive plural form pa\u00f0a + l\u0113ah ('open ground, clearing in a forest'); pa\u00f0a l\u0113ah would mean \"woodland clearing of the paths\", referring to paths up Nidderdale and from Ripon to Craven, which intersected here. However, the Pateley name forms competed in the Middle Ages with forms like Padlewath (1227) and Patheslayewathe which could be from Middle English *padil ('a shallow place in water') + Old Norse vath ('ford') and it could be that they owe something to this name.Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v.

Although the Brittonic name is clearly derived from the word *cornu-, which means \"horn\", opinions diverge over whether or not this refers to the shape of the land. Considering that Cornwall is at the end of a long tapering peninsula, many scholars have adopted this derivation for the south-western Cornovii. For instance, Graham Webster in The Cornovii (1991), which is primarily about the Midlands tribe, states that the horn derivation could apply as long as the geography was apparent, as it might have been to Roman surveyors in the first century, and Victor Watts in the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-names (2010) interprets the name *Cornowii, a different spelling for latinised Cornovii, as \"the people of the horn\"."]}, {"page": "Shipley, West Sussex", "response": ["Shipley is first mentioned in a charter of 1073 as Scapeleia, and in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Sepelei.
