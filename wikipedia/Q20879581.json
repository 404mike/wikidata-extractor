Her artistic efforts drew praise while she was attending high school at Melbourne Girls Grammar (known as Merton Hall), though in most other respects Rix was not an outstanding student. Both took art lessons with a Mr Mather, before Hilda studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading Australian Impressionist, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Jessie Traill, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. Rix would subsequently be critical of McCubbin's approach to teaching, referring to his methods as \"vague persuasions\". Nevertheless, the author of the only comprehensive biography of Rix, John Pigot, considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways: he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting; he modelled the importance of nationalistic ideas and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting; and his work emphasised the painting's subject over technical considerations."]}, {"page": "Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors", "response": ["* Dora Wilson (1883\u20131946) Mary Alice Lee, 'Wilson, Dora Lynnell (1883\u20131946)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/wilson-dora-lynnell-9134/text16113, published in hardcopy 1990, accessed online 17 November 2014.", "File:Dora Wilson - St Francis' Church, Melbourne.jpg|St Francis' Church, Melbourne, Dora Wilson, State Library Victoria"]}, {"page": "Dora Lynnell Wilson", "response": ["#REDIRECTDora Wilson"]}, {"page": "Ruth Sutherland", "response": ["Sutherland was the niece of the painter Jane Sutherland and the sister of the composer Margaret Sutherland.
