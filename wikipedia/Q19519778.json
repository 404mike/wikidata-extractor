Financial problems during the off-season meant that the squad was hit by the triple-departure of forwards Harry Anstiss, George Pither and long-serving wing half Alf Amos to league rivals Millwall. The previous season's leading goalscorer Harry Morris was successfully retained and the money generated from the sales allowed the squad's wages to be paid through the off-season. 11 new players were transferred in, with a contingent from the North East, including full back George Kell, half backs Bill Inglis and John Haggan and forwards Gordon Johnstone, Reginald Parker, Harry Stott and John Thain. Trainer Michael Whitham was replaced by former Bees manager Dusty Rhodes.", "|John Haggan", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |John Haggan", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |John Haggan", "| John Haggan", "| John Haggan"]}, {"page": "Haggan, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Haggan"]}]}}
