Many players preferred the \"spot-barred\" style with limitations on the number of consecutive pots of the red that were allowed, but some preferred the \"all-in\" rules that did not include this restriction.

Peall was the leading \"all-in\" player in the era. Roberts maintained his spot-barred supremacy, and did not challenge either Peall or Billy Mitchell for the championship.

This was a round-robin handicap event featuring 8 professionals and ran from 7 to 12 October 1901. The event resulted in a tie between William Peall and Harry Stevenson, with 6 wins out of 7. There was a play-off on the Monday.
