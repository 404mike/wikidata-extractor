His best-known roles include a Winkie Guard in The Wizard of Oz (1939); the female monster in Frankenstein's Daughter (1958); and together with Mike Mazurki the henchman of George Raft's \"Spats Colombo\" in Some Like It Hot (1959).\nIn 1961, in a credited role, he appeared as a townsman in the TV Western series Bat Masterson (S3E18 \"The Prescott Campaign\").\nFor over fifteen years Wilson was a stand-in for Wallace Beery, and he is the grandfather of actress Shauna Bloom. Wilson died in 1978, aged 80.", "link_mentions": {}}}
