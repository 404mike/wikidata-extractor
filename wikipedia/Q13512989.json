His best-known roles include a Winkie Guard in The Wizard of Oz (1939); the female monster in Frankenstein's Daughter (1958); and together with Mike Mazurki the henchman of George Raft's \"Spats Colombo\" in Some Like It Hot (1959).\nIn 1961, in a credited role, he appeared as a townsman in the TV Western series Bat Masterson (S3E18 \"The Prescott Campaign\").\nFor over fifteen years Wilson was a stand-in for Wallace Beery, and he is the grandfather of actress Shauna Bloom. Wilson died in 1978, aged 80.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 22", "response": ["*  1897   \u2013 Harry Wilson, English-American actor and singer (d. 1987)"]}, {"page": "The Big House (1930 film)", "response": ["* Harry Wilson......Convict number #46375"]}, {"page": "Frankenstein's monster", "response": ["|| Harry Wilson || Frankenstein's Daughter"]}, {"page": "Them!", "response": ["* Other actors who appear in small parts include John Beradino, Willis Bouchey, Booth Colman, Richard Deacon, Lawrence Dobkin, Ann Doran, William Schallert, Douglas Spencer, Dub Taylor, Dorothy Green, Harry Wilson, Dick York, Jan Merlin, and Walter Coy."]}, {"page": "Frankenstein's Daughter", "response": ["While Oliver tries to reanimate \"her\", Boyd and Dillon arrive.

He writes that \"it's never clear if the monster is entirely a female \u2013 it certainly doesn't look like a woman \u2013 or has the body of a man and the head of a woman ... we never know if the monster is male, female, or a mixture \u2013 or why that would make any difference\". He blames much of this on the monster makeup, writing that \"when he learned at the last moment the monster was supposed to be a woman, [makeup artist Harry] Thomas hastily scrawled lipstick on its mouth and sent it on to movie immortality\". In an interview, Cuhna laid the blame for the makeup not on Harry Thomas, but on a short shooting schedule and low budget, telling crtitc Tom Weaver that \"it was a situation where we just got trapped, again, without any money. We had no preparation time, and Frankenstein's Daughter was designed on the set on the first day of shooting ... we just didn't have enough money to create a monster that would represent Sally Todd. Thomas told Weaver in a separate interview that he \"wanted to make Sally Todd up as the monster, but the producers didn't think she was big enough to fight and look menacing\"."]}, {"page": "The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.", "response": ["* Harry Wilson as Guard / doorman"]}, {"page": "Trial (film)", "response": ["* Harry Wilson - Courtroom Spectator (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Joe McDoakes", "response": ["|So You Want to Be a Cowboy || November 1950 || April 14, 1951 || Phyllis Coates, Ted Stanhope, Eddie Gribbon, Harry Wilson."]}, {"page": "Macbeth (1948 film)", "response": ["*Harry Wilson as Banquet Guest (uncredited) "]}, {"page": "The Hallelujah Trail", "response": ["|Harry Wilson||One of the miners"]}, {"page": "Baby Face (film)", "response": ["* Harry Wilson as laborer (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "One Million B.C.", "response": ["* Harry Wilson as Rock tribe member"]}, {"page": "Kiss the Blood Off My Hands", "response": ["*Harry Wilson as a man in the pub"]}, {"page": "Bloodlust!", "response": ["* Harry Wilson as a trophy (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Harry Wilson", "response": ["Harry Wilson may refer to:", "* Harry Wilson (American football coach), coach at Buchtel College, active 1896", "* Harry Wilson (halfback) (1902\u20131990), American football, basketball, and lacrosse player", "* Harry Wilson (hurdler) (1896\u20131979), New Zealand track and field athlete", "* Harry Wilson (Northamptonshire cricketer) (1897\u20131960)", "* Harry Wilson (Worcestershire cricketer) (1873\u20131906)", "* Harry Wilson (rugby league), English rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s and 1900s", "* Harry Wilson (rugby union) (born 1999), Australian rugby union player", "* Harry Wilson (Australian footballer) (1885\u20131972), Australian rules footballer with South Melbourne", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1896), Irish footballer", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1897), English footballer", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1953), English footballer", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1997), Welsh footballer", "* Harry Wilson (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle)", "* Harry Wilson (actor) (1897\u20131978), English-born American character actor", "* Harry Wilson (businessman) (born 1971), member of the auto industry task force, former financial executive", "* Harry Wilson (politician) (1869\u20131948), American politician in Louisiana"]}, {"page": "Damn Yankees (film)", "response": ["* Harry Wilson as Spectator (uncredited) "]}, {"page": "Hot Ice (1955 film)", "response": ["* Harry Wilson as Bum in bed"]}, {"page": "Stairway to Light", "response": ["* Harry Wilson as Keeper Hosing Down Mental Patient (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["* Harry Wilson (disambiguation), multiple people", "** Harry Wilson (American football coach), US American football coach", "** Harry Wilson (Louisiana politician) Harry D.
