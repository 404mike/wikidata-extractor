Distinguished in mathematics and Classics, in 1830 he was elected a Fellow of Trinity at his first sitting.  In 1832 he took his MA degree, and as a travelling Fellow undertook a journey in Italy, Greece, Asia Minor and Crete, of which he published his two-volume Travels in Crete.  His work is considered a classic of writing on the Ottoman Empire, with his detailed observations on local geography, customs, and social issues.\nIn 1837, he was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple. He lost his valuable library and antiquities in fire at Temple in 1838. He was appointed as a queen's counsel in 1851\nHe stood for Parliament in the 1852 general election for King's Lynn but was not elected.\nIn 1853 he married Marie, the only daughter of Baron Von Lauer of Berlin. They had three children.\nHe published two works on economics: On Pauperism (1854), and Observations on the government bill for abolishing the Removal of the Poor (1854).\nHe died in 1859 at 16, Manchester Square, London and was buried at the Kensal Green cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Polybius", "response": ["As a hostage in Rome, then as client to the Scipios, and after 146 BC, a collaborator with Roman rule, Polybius was probably in no position to freely express any negative opinions of Rome. Peter Green advises that Polybius was chronicling Roman history for a Greek audience, to justify what he believed to be the inevitability of Roman rule. Nonetheless, Green considers Polybius's Histories the best source for the era they cover. For Ronald Mellor, Polybius was a loyal partisan of Scipio, intent on vilifying his patron's opponents.The Historians of Ancient Rome, Ronald J. Mellor Adrian Goldsworthy, while using Polybius as a source for Scipio's generalship, notes Polybius' underlying and overt bias in Scipio's favour.  H. Ormerod considers that Polybius cannot be regarded as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' in relation to his betes noires; the Aetolians, the Carthaginians, and the Cretans.Piracy in the Ancient World, p141 H Ormerod  Other historians perceive considerable negative bias in Polybius' account of Crete;Mogens Herman Hansen 1995, Sources for the Ancient Greek City-State: Symposium, August 24\u201327, 1994, Kgl.

To the east, Cape Drapanon rises above the plain and extends out into the Sea of Crete. The area is very green and fertile, unusual for rocky Crete. The Kiliaris river, known in antiquity as 'Pyknos', runs through the region. Robert Pashley suggested that the name 'Apokoronas' came from the ancient city of Ippokoronas or Ippokoronion, also cited by Strabo. This city may have been located near modern Nipos, or on the site of the Venetian fortress, Castel Apicorono, on an outcrop between Kalyves and Almyrida. The major towns of Apokoronas are Vamos, Armenoi and Vryses, with police, municipal and utility offices as well as taverns and large churches; Kalyves, Almyrida and Georgioupoli are the largest beach resorts. Tourism and agriculture are the major local industries, with much construction and quarrying to satisfy the demands of many foreigners eager to buy or rent properties in what used to be beautiful and traditional villages.

The site was rediscovered in the 19th century by British explorers Robert Pashley and Captain T. A. B. Spratt.  Spratt, of the Royal Navy, noted in 1859 that the former harbor of the deserted site was now 100 yards from the sea, and that the ancient sea coast must have risen at least twenty four feet. Modern excavation has confirmed this judgment, and also has shown that the harbor rapidly silted up after the Roman attack.Pirazzoli, P.

Radiocarbon dating of fossil algae along the ancient sea level mark on the cliffs around Phalasarna estimates the sudden sea level change at some time more than sixteen centuries ago. A probable event was the great earthquake and tsunami of 21 July A.D. 365, which wreaked catastrophic damage on all the coasts of the eastern Mediterranean and was recorded by Ammianus MarcellinusAmmianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, 26.10.15- 19 and others.
