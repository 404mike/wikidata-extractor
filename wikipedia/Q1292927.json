After three years at Eton College, Edward Malet entered the foreign service at the age of 17. \nHe served as attach\u00e9 to his father in Frankfurt, then in Brussels.\nHe was trained in the diplomatic service by Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, and was a member of the Tory-sympathetic 'Lyons School' of British diplomacy.He served as Secretary of Legation at Peking (1871\u20131873), Athens (1873\u20131875), Rome (1875\u20131878), and Constantinople (1878\u20131879). Malet formed close ties with Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II (\"Abdul the Damned\")  during 1878, the year of the Treaties of San Stefano and Berlin.\nMalet was appointed Agent and Consul-General in Egypt on 10 October 1879. He served there until 1883, pressing for administrative and financial reforms. He was at first sympathetic to Ahmed Orabi's demand for constitutional government. However, historians John Galbraith and Afaf al-Sayyid-Marsot write that after British-French Joint Note was sent to the Egyptian government, Malet gradually began to support the plans of the Gladstone Cabinet to intervene in Egypt, writing on 13 February 1882, \"I am prejudiced against the Nationalists.\":\u200a476\u2013478\u200a He served a crucial role in the decision of Gladstone's Cabinet to invade Alexandria when he sent a telegram to the Cabinet that both exaggerated the instability of the Khedive's rule in Egypt and also advised the British government to conduct a naval demonstration off Alexandria.:\u200a477\u200a (see 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War). Galbraith and al-Sayyid-Marsot describe him as having been naive, in that he hoped the British would attempt to militarily intimidate Urabi, though he never expected an actual attack or occupation by British forces:\u200a478\u200a He later served as Minister to Belgium (1883\u20131884), and Ambassador to the German Empire (1884\u20131895).In 1892 he built an immense Beaux-Arts villa \"Le Chateau Malet\" at Cap D\u2019Ail, France.On 19 March 1885, Edward Malet married Lady Ermyntrude Sackville Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford and Lady Elizabeth Sackville-West.\nThe Malet Memorial Hall, a Tudor Revival-style building which had a church on its upper floor, was founded in his memory by his widow in 1912 in Bexhill-on-Sea.  It opened in October 1913.Malet Street, a street in the Bloomsbury district of Central London, has been named in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)", "response": ["Word of the bashi-bazouks' atrocities filtered to the outside world by way of the American-run Robert College located in Constantinople. The majority of the students were Bulgarian, and many received news of the events from their families back home. Soon the Western diplomatic community in Constantinople was abuzz with rumours, which eventually found their way into newspapers in the West. While in Constantinople in 1879, Protestant missionary George Warren Wood reported Turkish authorities in Amasia brutally persecuting Christian Armenian refugees from Soukoum Kaleh. He was able to coordinate with British diplomat Edward Malet to bring the matter to the attention of the Sublime Porte, and then to the British foreign secretary Robert Gascoyne-Cecil (the Marquess of Salisbury). In Britain, where Disraeli's government was committed to supporting the Ottomans in the ongoing Balkan crisis, the Liberal opposition newspaper Daily News hired American journalist Januarius A. MacGahan to report on the massacre stories firsthand."]}, {"page": "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt", "response": ["In the early 1880s, Britain was struggling with its Egyptian protectorate. Wilfrid Blunt was sent to notify Sir Edward Malet, the British agent, as to the Egyptian public opinion concerning the recent changes in government and development policies. In mid-December 1881, Blunt met with Ahmed 'Urabi, known as Arabi or \"El Wahid\" (the Only One) due to his popularity with the Egyptians. 'Urabi was impressed with Blunt's enthusiasm and appreciation of Egyptian culture. Their mutual respect created an environment in which 'Urabi could peacefully explain the reasoning behind his new nationalist movement, \"Egypt for the Egyptians\". Over the course of several days, Arabi explained the complicated background of the revolutionaries and their determination to rid themselves of the Ottoman oligarchy. Wilfrid Blunt was vital in the relay of this information to the British administration in Egypt, although this did not prevent tensions from flaring up into a conflict soon after."]}, {"page": "Malet Street", "response": ["The street is named after Sir Edward Malet who was married to Lady Ermyntrude Sackville Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford who owned much of the surrounding area."]}, {"page": "Auckland Colvin", "response": ["Colvin's opportunity came when in January 1878 he was transferred for employment in Egypt, serving first as head of the cadastral survey, and then from 24 May as British commissioner of the debt, in place of Major Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer). Again in June 1880 he succeeded Major Baring as English controller of Egyptian finance, with M. de Bligni\u00e8res as his French colleague. From time to time he acted as British Consul-general in Sir Edward Malet's absence, and he was acting for Malet when the mutiny of 9 September 1881 broke out. By his advice and persuasion the timorous Khedive Tewfik confronted Urabi, the rebel leader, in the square of the Abdin palace, and succeeded in postponing the insurrection.Colvin's official minute, 19 Sept.; Cromer, Modern Egypt, i. 206\u20138"]}, {"page": "Anglo-Egyptian War", "response": ["A.G. Hopkins rejected Robinson and Gallagher's argument, citing original documents to claim that there was no perceived danger to the Suez Canal from the \u2018Urabi movement, and that \u2018Urabi and his forces were not chaotic \"anarchists\", but rather maintained law and order. He alternatively argues that British Prime Minister William Gladstone's cabinet was motivated by protecting the interests of British bondholders with investments in Egypt as well as by pursuit of domestic political popularity. Hopkins cites the British investments in Egypt that grew massively leading into the 1880s, partially as a result of the Khedive's debt from construction of the Suez Canal, as well as the close links that existed between the British government and the economic sector. He writes that Britain's economic interests occurred simultaneously with a desire within one element of the ruling Liberal Party for a militant foreign policy in order to gain the domestic political popularity that enabled it to compete with the Conservative Party. Hopkins cites a letter from Edward Malet, the British consul general in Egypt at the time, to a member of the Gladstone Cabinet offering his congratulations on the invasion: \"You have fought the battle of all Christendom and history will acknowledge it. May I also venture to say that it has given the Liberal Party a new lease of popularity and power.\"", "John Galbraith and Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid-Marsot make a similar argument to Hopkins, though their argument focuses on how individuals within the British government bureaucracy used their positions to make the invasion appear as a more favourable option. First, they describe a plot by Edward Malet in which he portrayed the Egyptian government as unstable to his superiors in the cabinet. On Galbraith and al-Sayyid-Marsot's reading, Malet na\u00efvely expected he could convince the British to intimidate Egypt with a show of force without considering a full invasion or occupation as a possibility. They also dwell on Admiral Beauchamp Seymour, who hastened the start of the bombardment by exaggerating the danger posed to his ships by \u2018Urabi's forces in his telegrams back to the British government."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Egypt", "response": ["*1879\u20131883: Edward Malet"]}, {"page": "Frank Lascelles (diplomat)", "response": ["Lascelles served in junior positions at the British embassies in Madrid, Paris, Rome, Washington D.C., and Athens.
