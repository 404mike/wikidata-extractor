A team including Bruce Rioch, John Moore and Graham French won the Fourth Division championship in 1967\u201368 under the leadership of former player Allan Brown; two years later Malcolm Macdonald's goals helped them to another promotion, while comedian Eric Morecambe became a director of the club. Luton Town won promotion back to the First Division in 1973\u201374, but were relegated the following season by a solitary point. Former Luton player David Pleat was made manager in 1978, and by 1982\u201383 the team was back in the top flight. The team which Pleat assembled at Kenilworth Road was notable at the time for the number of black players it included; during an era when many English squads were almost entirely white, Luton often fielded a mostly black team. Talented players such as Ricky Hill, Brian Stein and Emeka Nwajiobi made key contributions to the club's success during this period, causing it to accrue \"a richer history of black stars than any in the country\", in the words of journalist Gavin Willacy."]}, {"page": "Graham Lafite", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graham French"]}, {"page": "1957 UCI Track Cycling World Championships", "response": ["| Paul Depaepe  || Walter Bucher  || Graham French"]}, {"page": "1956 UCI Track Cycling World Championships", "response": ["|Graham French || Guillermo Timoner|| Walter Bucher"]}]}}
