Gross lasted 9 months as Spurs finished in 14th place in 1998, and began the next season with just 3 points from their opening three games. Sugar next appointed George Graham, a former player and manager of bitter rivals Arsenal.

He was replaced by Peter Shreeves, who only months before had been in charge of Division One side Sheffield Wednesday, and quickly turned Barnet's form around. With only the Conference champions going up in this season the prospect of promotion was already long-gone by the time Shreeves was appointed, but the 5th-place finish that they ultimately managed would be good enough for the play-offs introduced for the following season. Unfortunately Barnet did not maintain their momentum into 2002\u201303, and Shreeves was sacked late in that season, with Barnet in very much the same mid-table position he had found them in. Martin Allen took over as manager and brought a turn-around in results, though it was again too late to mount a promotion challenge and they finished a distinctly underwhelming 11th. 2003\u201304 proved to be a much better campaign, and the club were challenging near the top of the table throughout the season, but Allen left to take over at fellow London club Brentford with only a couple of months of the campaign left.", "*2003  Peter Shreeves"]}, {"page": "Glenn Hoddle", "response": ["In June 1993, Hoddle became player-manager of Chelsea.
