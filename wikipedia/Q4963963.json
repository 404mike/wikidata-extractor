He underwent cataract surgery and obtained a magnifying machine, which allowed him to continue writing. In 2002, at the age of 88, Trevor-Roper submitted a sizable article on Thomas Sutton, the founder of Charterhouse School, to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography in part with notes he had written decades earlier, which editor Brian Harrison praised as \"the work of a master\". Trevor-Roper suffered several other minor ailments related to his advanced age, but according to his stepson, \"bore all his difficulties stoically and without complaint\". That year, he was diagnosed with cancer and died on 26 January 2003 in a hospice in Oxford, aged 89."]}, {"page": "Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood", "response": ["* Sir Brian Harrison \u2013 Professor of Modern History, Oxford University"]}, {"page": "Dictionary of National Biography", "response": ["Following Matthew's death in October 1999, he was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Professor Brian Harrison, in January 2000.  The new dictionary, now known as the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (or ODNB), was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes in print at a price of \u00a37500, and in an online edition for subscribers. Most UK holders of a current library card can access it online free of charge. In subsequent years, the print edition has been able to be obtained new for a much lower price.E.g., at least one U.K. bookseller in 2012 was asking \u00a31738.44 (US$2842.42) including free worldwide delivery. At publication, the 2004 edition had 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives, including entries on all subjects included in the old DNB. (The old DNB entries on these subjects may be accessed separately through a link to the \"DNB Archive\" \u2013 many of the longer entries are still highly regarded.) A small permanent staff remain in Oxford to update and extend the coverage of the online edition. Harrison was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Dr Lawrence Goldman, in October 2004. The first online update was published on 4 January 2005, including subjects who had died in 2001. A further update, including subjects from all periods, followed on 23 May 2005, and another on 6 October 2005. New subjects who died in 2002 were added to the online dictionary on 5 January 2006, with continuing releases in May and October in subsequent years following the precedent of 2005. The ODNB also includes some new biographies on people who died before the DNB was published and are not included in the original DNB, because they have become notable since the DNB was published through the work of more recent historians, for example William Eyre (fl. 1634\u20131675)."]}, {"page": "Christopher Simpson", "response": ["*H.
