The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic defines the term as \"fight, battle; jihad, holy war (against the infidels, as a religious duty)\". Nonetheless, it is usually used in the religious sense and its beginnings are traced back to the Qur'an and the words and actions of Muhammad.Rudolph Peters, Jih\u0101d (The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World); Oxfordislamicstudies. . Retrieved 17 February 2008.Jonathon P. Berkey, The Formation of Islam; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2003 The notion of Jihad has its origins in the Islamic principle that the whole humankind must embrace Islam. In the Qur'an and in later Muslim usage, jihad is commonly followed by the expression fi sabil illah, \"in the path of God.\"For a listing of all appearances in the Qur'an of jihad and related words, see Muhammad Fu'ad 'Abd al-Baqi, Al-Mu\u02bfjam al-Mufahras li-Alfaz al-Qur'an al-Karim (Cairo: Matabi' ash-Sha'b, 1278), pp. 182\u201383; and Hanna E. Kassis, A Concordance of the Qur'an (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983), pp. 587\u201388. Muhammad Abdel-Haleem states that it indicates \"the way of truth and justice, including all the teachings it gives on the justifications and the conditions for the conduct of war and peace.\" It is sometimes used without religious connotation, with a meaning similar to the English word \"crusade\" (as in \"a crusade against drugs\").", "Islamic scholar Rudolph Peters also wrote that with the stagnation of Islamic expansionism, the concept of jihad became internalized as a moral or spiritual struggle. Earlier classical works on fiqh emphasized jihad as war for God's religion, Peters found. Later Islamic scholars like Ibn al-Amir al-San'ani, Muhammad Abduh, Rashid Rida, Ubaidullah Sindhi, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Shibli Nomani, etc emphasized the defensive aspect of Jihad, distinguishing between defensive Jihad ( jihad al-daf) and offensive Jihad ( Jihad al-talab or Jihad of choice ). They refuted the notion of consensus on Jihad al-talab being a communal obligation( fard kifaya ). In support of this view, these scholars referred to the works of classical scholars such as Al-Jassas, Ibn Taymiyyah, etc. According to Ibn Taymiyya, the reason for Jihad against non-Muslims is not their disbelief, but the threat they pose to Muslims. Citing Ibn Taymiyya, scholars like Rashid Rida, Al San'ani, Qaradawi,etc argues that unbelievers need not be fought unless they pose a threat to Muslims. Thus, Jihad is obligatory only as a defensive warfare to respond to aggression or \"perfidy\" against the\u00a0Muslim community, and that the \"normal and desired state\" between Islamic and non-Islamic territories was one of \"peaceful coexistence.\" This was similar to the Western concept of a \"Just war\". Similarly the 18th-century Islamic scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab defined Jihad as a defensive military action to protect the Muslim community, and emphasized its defensive aspect in synchrony with later 20th century Islamic writers. Today, some Muslim authors only recognize wars fought for the purpose of territorial defense as well as wars fought for the defense of religious freedom as legitimate.Rudolph Peters, Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam (Markus Wiener Publishers, 2005), p. 125", "In modern times, Pakistani scholar and professor Fazlur Rahman Malik has used the term to describe the struggle to establish a \"just moral-social order\",Fazlur Rahman, Major Themes of the Quran, (Minneapolis: Bibliotheca Islamica, 1980), pp. 63\u201364. while President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia has used it to describe the struggle for economic development in that country.Rudolph Peters, Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam (Princeton, N.J.: Markus Weiner, 1996), pp. 116\u201317", "* Rudolph Peters: Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam", "* Rudolph Peters, Islam and Colonialism: The Doctrine of Jihad in Modern History, Religion and Society, The Hague: Mouton, 1979"]}, {"page": "Thiamine", "response": ["Thiamine was first named \"aneurin\" (for anti-neuritic vitamin). Sir Rudolph Peters, in Oxford, introduced thiamine-deprived pigeons as a model for understanding how thiamine deficiency can lead to the pathological-physiological symptoms of beriberi. Indeed, feeding the pigeons upon polished rice leads to an easily recognizable behavior of head retraction, a condition called opisthotonos. If not treated, the animals died after a few days. Administration of thiamine at the stage of opisthotonos led to a complete cure within 30 minutes. As no morphological modifications were observed in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peters introduced the concept of a biochemical lesion.", "File:Rudolph Albert Peters.jpg|Rudolph Peters"]}, {"page": "List of Old Wellingtonians", "response": ["*Sir Rudolph Peters FRS, biochemist"]}, {"page": "Hugh Macdonald Sinclair", "response": ["At the beginning of the war in 1939, Sinclair joined a Ministry of Supply team under Professor Rudolph Peters in the Department of Biochemistry, seeking countermeasures to poison gas, but the nutritional status of the population and how to assess it began to occupy Sinclair more and more.

Instead of the Department of Human Nutrition, which Sinclair had expected to be able to set up after the war, he was designated Director of the Laboratory of Human Nutrition, which was allocated a few Nissen huts at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, which had recently been released by the U.S. forces. The Laboratory inherited most of the equipment and some of the staff of the Survey, but not the accommodation. He was appointed as the first University Reader in Human Nutrition in 1951.
