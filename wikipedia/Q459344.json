The film employed an idea drawn from the British showbiz tradition in which extras used the word \"rhubarb\" to simulate low-level background dialogue, which had also been a running joke in The Goon Show.

At the end of her act, to great applause, she leapt in the air, finishing in the splits, landing as softly as a snowflake in July\".
