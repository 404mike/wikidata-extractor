Very little is known about his life, other than he lived in Watery Lane, Tipton, Staffordshire. During his short lifetime he published a collection of his compositions, Sacred Music (Tipton: for the Author, c. 1830), containing 20 hymn tunes.\nHe met an unfortunate death in a mining-related accident on the Himley Road, Dudley, on 14 April 1834. He was walking along the road near to a mine-pit, and an explosion taking place threw a large rock into the air which killed him instantly. The pit's owners, Messrs. Horton, were not penalised for the accident.A second collection of his music, The Celestial Chorister (London: Joseph Hart, c. 1835), was published posthumously, as the title page states, to raise money for his widow and 6 children. The collection is unusual in that 12 of the hymns take their titles from the 12 signs of the Zodiac.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tipton", "response": ["*Joseph Williams (composer) (c.1800\u20131834), English coal-miner and composer of sacred music, lived in Watery Lane, Tipton"]}, {"page": "West gallery music", "response": ["*Joseph Williams"]}, {"page": "Joseph Williams", "response": ["Joseph Williams may refer to:", "* Joseph Williams (composer) (1800\u20131834), English composer", "* Joseph Williams (music publisher), London music publisher", "* Joseph Williams (musician) (born 1960), rock singer with band Toto", "* Joseph Williams (athlete) (1897\u2013?), British Olympic athlete", "* Joseph Williams (Connecticut politician) (1779\u20131865)", "* Joseph Williams (Nevisian cricketer) (born 1989)", "* Joseph Williams (English cricketer) (1892\u20131916)", "* Joseph Williams (Barbadian cricketer) (born 1974)", "* Joseph Williams (footballer) (1857\u2013?), Welsh international footballer", "* Joseph Williams (justice) (1801\u20131870), Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court", "* Joseph Williams (bishop) (1857\u20131934), Bishop of St John's, South Africa", "* Joseph Williams (actor), English stage actor"]}]}}
