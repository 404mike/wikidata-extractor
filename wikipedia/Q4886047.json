He joined in 1988 when the band acquired another brass section playing trumpet (also including Bobby Bilsborough on saxophone and David Peel on trombone). When the band decided to drop the brass section in early 1990, Ben became the keyboard player. He was with them at the height of their success in autumn and early winter of 1990, when they achieved chart success with \"Groovy Train\" and \"All Together Now\".\nHe later went on to become keyboard player for the second incarnation of Happy Mondays in the late 1990s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Farm (British band)", "response": ["* Ben Leach\u00a0\u2013 keyboards (1988\u20131996, 2004\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Spartacus (The Farm album)", "response": ["*Ben Leach - synthesizers and electronic piano"]}, {"page": "List of keyboardists", "response": ["*Ben Leach (The Farm)"]}, {"page": "Leach (surname)", "response": ["* Ben Leach (born 1969), player in English pop group The Farm"]}]}}
