Christiansen writes that, from the days of Charlemagne, the free pagan people living around the Baltic Sea in northern Europe raided the countries that surrounded  them: Denmark, Prussia, Germany and Poland.  In the eleventh century, various German and Danish nobles responded militarily to put a stop to it and make peace.  They did achieve peace for a time, but it didn't last; there was insurrection, which created a desire for more military response in the twelfth century.", "Eric Christiansen writes that \"These crusades can only be properly understood in light of the Cistercian movement, the rise of papal monarchy, the mission of the friars, the coming of the Mongol hordes, the growth of the Muscovite and Lithuanian empires, and the aims of the Conciliar movement in the fifteenth century.\" The Conciliar movement arose out of the profound malaise within western Christendom over schism and corruption in the church. It asked: where did ultimate authority in the church reside? Did it reside in the Pope, the body of cardinals who elected him, the bishops, or did it reside in the Christian community at large?"]}, {"page": "Christiansen", "response": ["*Eric Christiansen (1937\u20132016), English historian"]}, {"page": "L\u00f8rdagsbarnetimen", "response": ["The lyric of the legendary theme song \"Now comes the children's hour (hush, hush, hush, be quiet as a mouse)\" was written by the artist, author and songwriter Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner in 1950.
