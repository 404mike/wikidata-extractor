She was the daughter of Bernhard and Emma Kahn (n\u00e9e Eberstadt) of Mannheim and the sister of, among others, composer Robert Kahn and Wall St. financier Otto Hermann Kahn./* Philosopher for socialism */ John Kobler, Otto the Magnificent (NY: Scribner & Sons), 1988, pp. 10\u201311. He related in a notebook titled Brevarium Mysticum finding revealed love in the sight of a soaring eagle, a soulful dedication on a sojourn in the Harz Mountains.  Walther was highly literate and intelligent, wrote several books with deep philosophical overtones.  In Zur Kritik der Zeit contemporary human conditioning was critically examined on a sociological basis found in a life of business.  This put together another critique into an intellectual context of 'mind over matter', social wisdom and corporate discipline as a framework in the socialistic sciences \u2013 Zur Mechanik des Geistes.  Rathenau moved ever closer to a rejection of religion, embracing the power of science.  He tried to bring people's attention to what changes would be required for a futuristic romantic movement in Von Kommenden Dingen to openly challenge the living of lives.  Mechanistics rejected the central feature of Malthusian thoughts on human progress motivated by population growth.  His focus was the importance of technology, rather than abstinence for standardisation, specialization and abstraction with positive approbation.  The corollary for Rathenau of information-gathering was an exponential explosive growth in data that would enrich globalization.  Rathenau delineated his arguments by dividing men into classifications:  Mutmenschen and Furchtmenschen outlined the problems of mass migration across Europe which had resonance with the past.  But he saw real significance for Zweckmenschen as utilitarian cunning to set the men of fear in motion.  The philosophy amounted to Social Darwinism but there was an unaccredited presumption of delphic adoration for the Greek Parnassus.Kessler, Rathenau, pp. 35\u20137; Letourneau, Rathenau, pp. 72\u201377; 103\u20138"]}, {"page": "Kahn", "response": ["* Otto Hermann Kahn (1867\u20131934), German-born American banker and patron of the arts"]}, {"page": "Otto Kahn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Otto Hermann Kahn"]}, {"page": "Roger Wolfe Kahn", "response": ["Roger Wolfe Kahn (originally spelled \"Wolff\") was born in Morristown, New Jersey, into a wealthy German Jewish banking family.

E. Cummings, Sherwood Anderson, Kenneth Burke, Waldo Frank, Harriet Monroe, Marianne Moore, and Gertrude Stein. He was also an acquaintance of H. P. Lovecraft, who eventually would voice concern over Crane's premature aging due to alcohol abuse. Most serious work on Crane begins with his letters, selections of which are available in many editions of his poetry; his letters to Munson, Tate, Winters, and his patron, Otto Hermann Kahn, are particularly insightful. His two most famous stylistic defenses emerged from correspondences: his \"General Aims and Theories\" (1925) was written to urge Eugene O'Neill's critical foreword to White Buildings, then passed around among friends, yet unpublished during Crane's life; and the famous \"Letter to Harriet Monroe\" (1926) was part of an exchange for the publication of \"At Melville's Tomb\" in Poetry."]}, {"page": "Deutsche Bank", "response": ["* Otto Hermann Kahn \u2013 philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Estate (land)", "response": ["*Oheka Castle, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; estate of Otto Hermann Kahn"]}, {"page": "Kirsten Flagstad", "response": ["Flagstad was first noticed by Otto Hermann Kahn, then chairman of the board of the Metropolitan Opera, on a trip to Scandinavia in 1929, and Met management made overtures soon after.
