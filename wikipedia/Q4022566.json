At the same time, this pluralistic approach to codification is representative of the dispersion of Romani communities, and the lack of a central governmental authority. 'Linguistic pluralism' of this kind has been embraced as a policy by the European Roma and Traveller Forum (the elected Romani representation at the Council of Europe) in a statement on its website. It has also received the support of various leading linguists investigating Romani, such as the late Milena H\u00fcbschmannov\u00e1, Dieter W. Halwachs, and Yaron Matras. The RomLex online Romani dictionary acknowledges pluralism by incorporating dialect variants, albeit in a consistent and unified spelling system."]}, {"page": "Romani Studies (journal)", "response": ["*Yaron Matras (1999\u20132017)"]}]}}
