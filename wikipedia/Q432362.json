A two-time Laurence Olivier Award winner and a four-time nominee, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1982 and toured in many roles, as well as appearing on film and television. In 2001, he starred in his cousin Ronald Harwood's play Mahler's Conversion, and said that the story of a composer sacrificing his faith for his career echoed his own identity struggles.\nDuring his 2017 \"Commonwealth Tour\", Prince Charles referred to Sher as his favourite actor. Sher and his partner and collaborator Gregory Doran became one of the first same-sex couples to enter into a civil partnership in the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of South Africans", "response": ["*Antony Sher, actor, author and painter (1949\u20132021)"]}, {"page": "Ian McKellen", "response": ["In 1992, he acted in Pam Gems' revival of Chekov's Uncle Vanya at the Royal National Theatre alongside Antony Sher, and Janet McTeer. From 1993 to 1997 McKellen toured in a one man show entitled, A Knights Out, about coming out as a gay man. Laurie Winer from The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Even if he is preaching to the converted, McKellen makes us aware of the vast and powerful intolerance outside the comfortable walls of the theater. Endowed with a rare technique, he is a natural storyteller, an admirable human being and a hands-on activist.\" From 1997 to 1998, he starred as Dr. Tomas Stockmann in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People.

Olivier's portrayal (directed by Glen Byam Shaw, with Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth) was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Kenneth Tynan expressed the view that it succeeded because Olivier built the role to a climax at the end of the play, whereas most actors spend all they have in the first two acts.", "The RSC again achieved critical success in Gregory Doran's 1999 production at The Swan, with Antony Sher and Harriet Walter in the central roles, once again demonstrating the suitability of the play for smaller venues. Doran's witches spoke their lines to a theatre in absolute darkness, and the opening visual image was the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo in the berets and fatigues of modern warfare, carried on the shoulders of triumphant troops. In contrast to Nunn, Doran presented a world in which king Duncan and his soldiers were ultimately benign and honest, heightening the deviance of Macbeth (who seems genuinely surprised by the witches' prophecies) and Lady Macbeth in plotting to kill the king. The play said little about politics, instead powerfully presenting its central characters' psychological collapse."]}, {"page": "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui", "response": ["The role of Ui has been played by such other notable actors as Peter Falk, Griff Rhys Jones, Leonard Rossiter, Antony Sher, Nicol Williamson, Henry Goodman Hugo Weaving, and Jean Vilar, as well as Australian actor John Bell.

Thorndike was joined by, among others, Harcourt Williams, Joyce Redman and Margaret Leighton. It was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays: Peer Gynt, Arms and the Man, Richard III and Uncle Vanya. Olivier's roles were the Button Moulder, Sergius, Richard and Astrov; Richardson played Peer, Bluntschli, Richmond and Vanya. The first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences; Uncle Vanya had a mixed reception, although The Times thought Olivier's Astrov \"a most distinguished portrait\" and Richardson's Vanya \"the perfect compound of absurdity and pathos\". In Richard III, according to Billington, Olivier's triumph was absolute: \"so much so that it became his most frequently imitated performance and one whose supremacy went unchallenged until Antony Sher played the role forty years later\". In 1945 the company toured Germany, where they were seen by many thousands of Allied servicemen; they also appeared at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise theatre in Paris, the first foreign company to be given that honour. The critic Harold Hobson wrote that Richardson and Olivier quickly \"made the Old Vic the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world.\""]}, {"page": "Titus Andronicus", "response": ["In 1995, Gregory Doran directed a production at the Royal National Theatre, which also played at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa, starring Antony Sher as Titus, Dorothy Ann Gould as Tamora, Sello Maake as Aaron and Jennifer Woodbine as Lavinia. Although Doran explicitly denied any political overtones, the play was set in a modern African context and made explicit parallels to South African politics. In his production notes, which Doran co-wrote with Sher, he stated, \"Surely, to be relevant, theatre must have an umbilical connection to the lives of the people watching it.\" One particularly controversial decision was to have the play spoken in indigenous accents rather than Received Pronunciation, which allegedly resulted in many white South Africans refusing to see the play. Writing in Plays International in August 1995, Robert Lloyd Parry argued \"the questions raised by Titus went far beyond the play itself [to] many of the tensions that exist in the new South Africa; the gulf of mistrust that still exists between blacks and whites ... Titus Andronicus has proved itself to be political theatre in the truest sense.\"All information on Doran\u2019s production taken from Hughes (2006: 49)"]}, {"page": "Rings of Power", "response": ["Four Rings of Power appeared in Jackson's The Hobbit film series.

But as Sheridan Morley perceptively remarked in 2000, when reviewing Nicholas Wright's Cressida: \"Gambon's eccentricity on stage now begins to rival that of his great mentor Richardson\". Also like Richardson, interviews are rarely given and raise more questions than they answer. Gambon is a very private person, a \"non-starry star\" as Ayckbourn has called him. Off-stage he prefers to stay out of the limelight.
