In 2004, Richardson said the party was not anti-Semitic. She grew up in Stoke Newington the youngest of three sisters; her father came from Romania while her mother was born in London's East End, of Lithuanian descent.In the 2004 local elections, she won a seat on Epping Forest District Council, representing the Loughton Fairmead ward with a narrow majority of 13. Her husband, Thomas Richardson, also a BNP candidate, won the nearby ward of Loughton Broadway.In the 2008 local elections, she was elected in the Loughton Broadway ward, covering part of the Debden council estate, with a majority of 123 over Labour. Her old Fairmead seat was lost heavily to the Loughton Residents Association.From 2009, she was the leader of the BNP group on the local council, but in 2012 local elections lost her seats in both the District and Town Councils.\nUnder her leadership, the BNP campaigned against Muslim prayer meetings in Loughton, claiming in a leaflet approved by her (the Epping Forest Patriot) that the community hall used would be turned into a mosque. Following allegations of abduction and a firebomb attack on his home, the prayer meeting's organiser accused the BNP. He was subsequently questioned by police on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Richardson said the BNP was not behind the alleged attacks and told The Guardian, \"Firebombing is not a British method. A brick through the window is a British method.\"She was the BNP candidate for Epping Forest in the 2010 general election.\nIn the 2019 local elections she stood in Waltham Abbey Honey Lane ward for the For Britain Movement coming second to the Conservative Sam Kane.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Patricia Richardson", "response": ["Richardson served many years on the Board of Directors and is the National Spokesperson for \"Cure PSP\", a patient advocacy and research organization for progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy and related \"Prime Of Life\" diseases.

Despite this, the BNP had a Jewish councillor, Patricia Richardson, and spokesman Phil Edwards has stated that the party also has Jewish members. The BNP has stated that it does not deny the Holocaust, and that \"Dredging up quotes from 10, 15, 20 years ago is really pathetic and, in a sense, rather fascist.\" In an interview with the BNP deputy leader Simon Darby, Griffin said that the English Defence League was a \"Zionist false flag operation\", and added that the organisation is \"a neo-con operation\"."]}]}}
