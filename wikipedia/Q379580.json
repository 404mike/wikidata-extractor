His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley and Sequoia National Park, and his example has served as an inspiration for the preservation of many other wilderness areas. The Sierra Club, which he co-founded, is a prominent American conservation organization. In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests. As part of the campaign to make Yosemite a national park, Muir published two landmark articles on wilderness preservation in The Century Magazine, \"The Treasures of the Yosemite\" and \"Features of the Proposed Yosemite National Park\"; this helped support the push for U.S. Congress to pass a bill in 1890 establishing Yosemite National Park. The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings has inspired readers, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large nature areas.John Muir has been considered \"an inspiration to both Scots and Americans\". Muir's biographer, Steven J. Holmes, believes that Muir has become \"one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity\", both political and recreational. As a result, his writings are commonly discussed in books and journals, and he has often been quoted by nature photographers such as Ansel Adams. \"Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world\", writes Holmes.Muir was noted for being an ecological thinker, political spokesman, and religious prophet, whose writings became a personal guide into nature for many people, making his name \"almost ubiquitous\" in the modern environmental consciousness. According to author William Anderson, Muir exemplified \"the archetype of our oneness with the earth\", while biographer Donald Worster says he believed his mission was \"saving the American soul from total surrender to materialism\".:\u200a403\u200a On April 21, 2013, the first John Muir Day was celebrated in Scotland, which marked the 175th anniversary of his birth, paying homage to the conservationist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 22", "response": ["*John Muir (Episcopal Church)"]}, {"page": "April 21", "response": ["*1838 \u2013 John Muir, Scottish-American environmentalist and author (d. 1914)"]}, {"page": "Ant", "response": ["In his First Summer in the Sierra, John Muir notes that the Digger Indians of California ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black carpenter ants.

Also important was forester and ecologist Aldo Leopold, one of the founders of the Wilderness Society in 1935, who wrote a classic of nature observation and ethical philosophy, A Sand County Almanac, (1949).J.

The anthropocentric view has been seen as the conservationist approach to the environment with nature viewed, at least in part, as a resource to be used by man. In contrast to the conservationist approach the ecocentric view, associated with John Muir, Henry David Thoreau and William Wordsworth referred to as the preservationist movement.  This approach sees nature in a more spiritual way. Many environmental historians consider the split between John Muir and Gifford Pinchot.

Scotland however, lacks any such areas, as thousands of years of human activity have altered the landscape.

He published his experiences in the book Walden, which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in Yosemite Valley and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form Yosemite National Park and went on to set up the Sierra Club in 1892.
