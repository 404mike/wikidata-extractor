Of the five only Collins, Griffith and Barton were members of the cabinet. These envoys eventually signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December. Between the Truce and the signing of the Treaty the Second D\u00e1il only sat on 10 days, and did not discuss in detail the options available to it. The debate on the Treaty started on 14 December, and continued for thirteen days of debate until 7 January 1922. On that date, the D\u00e1il approved the treaty by 64 in favour to 57 against. The Treaty Debates were the first publicly reported debate on what Sinn F\u00e9in felt that it had achieved and could achieve. In the vote, the deputies who represented more than one constituency were each only permitted to vote once, but this would not have changed the outcome. As the leader of the anti-Treaty minority de Valera resigned as President, and on 9 January his opponent Arthur Griffith was elected as president on a vote of 60\u201358. The anti-Treaty deputies continued to attend the D\u00e1il, with de Valera becoming the first Leader of the Opposition in the D\u00e1il."]}, {"page": "Se\u00e1n T.

Wilson was already withdrawing from the Self-Determination League, making his critics label O'Kelly as 'pompous.' Despite the US Senate resolution in June, the President would not break his commitment to the Big Four for unanimity.Townshend, p.68. He also served as the Irish Republic's envoy, demanding recognition of the Republic and its admittance to the post-World War I peace treaty negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference. While this request to Clemenceau was sincere, it naively ignored the fact that France and Britain had been allied for the previous four years. O'Kelly was followed to Paris as envoy by the eminently better-qualified George Gavan Duffy, who was from a titled family of barristers and diplomats.Townshend, p.69. In 1920, O'Kelly relocated to Italy, where he met with Pope Benedict XV, briefing the pontiff on the political situation in Ireland. At the same time, O'Kelly met with the future dictator of Italy, Benito Mussolini, who helped the Irishman and other Sinn F\u00e9in emissaries to source weapons for use by the IRA.Mark Phelan, 'Prophet of the Oppressed Nations': Gabriele D'Annunzio and the Irish Republic, 1919\u201321, History Ireland, 21:5 (Sep./Oct. 2013) http://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/gabriele-dannunzio-irish-republic-1919-21/ "]}, {"page": "Arthur Griffith", "response": ["thumb|Arthur Griffith and three of the four other members of the Irish delegation (George Gavan Duffy, Erskine Childers and Robert Barton) for the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations in 1921"]}, {"page": "Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il", "response": ["|George Gavan Duffy"]}, {"page": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)", "response": ["|George Gavan Duffy"]}, {"page": "Council of State (Ireland)", "response": ["|Absentees were George Gavan Duffy, Douglas Hyde, Timothy Sullivan, W.

Like the Nicholson Act of 1860 which it modified, the Duffy Act provided, in specified areas, for new and extended pastoral leases. It was an effort to break the land-holding monopoly of the so-called \"squatter\" class. However, the bill had been amended into ineffectiveness by the Legislative Council so that it was easy for the squatters to employ dummies and extend their control. Duffy's attempts to correct the legislation were defeated. Historian Don Garden commented that \"Unfortunately Duffy's dreams were on a higher plane than his practical skills as a legislator and the morals of those opposed to him.\"George Gavan Duffy papers , historyireland.com; accessed 6 March 2016.", "*George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) was an Irish politician and a signatory to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.

When the Plantation of Ulster started in 1609 a body called The Honourable The Irish Society had been set up by Royal Charter in 1613 to administer the affairs of the Plantation. The Society was then given the rights to the fishing on the river and on the River Bann, all except the parts of the rivers owned by the Bishop of Derry. In 1944 an action for trespass was taken by the Society against a fisherman from Porthall who they deemed to be fishing illegally. The case was heard by Mr Justice George Gavan Duffy in the high court in Dublin during 1947/48. The case was dismissed against the man. The Society then appealed the decision and also appealed to both Northern and Southern Governments at losing the case. Both Governments agreed to buy the fishing rights for the sum of \u00a3110,280 on condition that they drop the appeal. This led to the establishment of a commission to oversee the fishing on the river and on Lough Foyle. The body set up was called the Foyle Fisheries Commission and was established by a Bill passed simultaneously by the Governments of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Irelandhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1952/5  on 25 March 1952.
