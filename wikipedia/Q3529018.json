He played cricket for his local club at Scarcliffe and later at Shirebrook where Derbyshire bowler Billy Bestwick was playing. In 1913 he obtained a job as a groom at Wiseton Hall in North Nottinghamshire, the home of Sir Joseph Laycock, where he looked after the cricket ground and played for Laycock's team. When World War I broke out he joined the artillery battery Laycock commanded, the 1/1st Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery, and was sent to Egypt. After the war Archibald White was playing at Wiseton and was so impressed with Elliott that he sought to recruit him for Yorkshire. However the rule of birthplace prevented this, so he went instead to his native Derbyshire.Elliott played his first first-class match for Derbyshire against Essex in June 1920. He quickly took over as wicketkeeper from George Beet. He continued playing for Derbyshire every year until 1939, and was a member of the team when the club won the County Championship in 1936. He played in four Tests for England which were against South Africa in 1927/8, against the West Indies in 1928 and twice against India in 1933/4. After the war he played a season for Derbyshire in 1947, sometimes together with his nephew Charlie Elliott. In his 532 first-class games, Elliott claimed 1206 victims - 903 caught, 303 stumped.Elliott later became an umpire and officiated in seven Tests between 1950 and 1953. His nephew Charlie Elliott was also umpire from 1957 to 1974.\nElliott ran a sports outfitters at Derby where he died at the age of 85.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Harry Elliott||||7||1950||1953"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Harry Elliott \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Harry Smith (cricketer, born 1891)", "response": ["He played just one Test match, the first match ever against the West Indies at Lord's in 1928.

In his absence, Corrall resumed as regular wicketkeeper for Leicestershire. Still in the RAF in the first two-thirds of the 1947 season, Dawkes played three first-class matches for the Combined Services cricket team before his discharge in August, when he joined Derbyshire for the county's final four County Championship matches of the season. Until Dawkes' arrival, Derbyshire had lacked a full-time wicketkeeper all season: the job was being done, mostly, by the former England batsman Denis Smith, and Wisden noted that \"handicapped by injury and the cares of wicket-keeping, Denis Smith revealed only glimpses of his true form\". For some matches when Smith was injured, Derbyshire had recalled prewar wicketkeeper Harry Elliott, believed at the time to be 51, but in reality 55 years of age. Unsurprisingly, at the end of the season, Dawkes was offered a contract and accepted.", "Dawkes therefore became Derbyshire's regular wicketkeeper from the start of the 1948 season and missed very few matches for the county over the next 13 seasons. In all, he played 392 first-class matches for Derbyshire, which puts him 10th on the all-time list of appearances. He is also third on the list of Derbyshire wicketkeepers, behind his successor, Bob Taylor and Harry Elliott, for catches, stumpings and overall dismissals."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Derbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "George Beet senior", "response": ["Beet was born in Somercotes, Derbyshire. Beet's first-class cricketing career began during the 1910 season, when he came in as wicket-keeper against Kent. At the time Derbyshire depended primarily on Joe Humphries behind the stumps. Beet appeared again two years later in the 1912 season, keeping wicket in a three games and losing his own wicket only once. In the 1913 and 1914 season he earned a regular place in the Derbyshire team as a batsman until the First World War interrupted his career. On his return in the 1919 season he was Derbyshire's regular wicket-keeper and also scored five half-centuries, including his career high score of 92 not out. He played occasionally during the first half of the 1920 season, but was displaced behind the stumps by Harry Elliott. He also played one game for MCC in 1920. From then on he appeared in just two further matches for the Derbyshire first team in the 1922 and 1925 season, the last being at the age of 39.

Harry Elliott, Jim Hutchinson and Harry Storer junior all made their debuts in 1920 and, over the next five years, the team welcomed Leslie Townsend, Stan Worthington and Garnet Lee. Denis Smith, who has one of the longest first-class careers on record, first appeared in 1927. Albert Alderman began in 1928 and then the team really took shape as Derbyshire discovered Tommy Mitchell, Alf Pope, Bill Copson, Charlie Elliott and George Pope. From 1928 to 1933, the team was always in mid-table.", "The team finally realised its potential and finished third behind Lancashire in 1934 and second behind Yorkshire in 1935.

Wicket-keeper Harry Elliott, very effective in combination with Mitchell, accounted for 62 batsmen. Four batsmen scored over 1,000 championship runs: Townsend, Worthington, Smith and Alderman. Derbyshire finished third in 1937, when Dusty Rhodes made his debut, and a creditable fifth in 1938 but then dropped back to mid-table in 1939. The promising pace bowler Cliff Gladwin made his debut in 1939 and played four times that season.

In 1928, Wally Hammond played in 35 matches and took 79 catches, all as a fielder. In the same season, Les Ames (122) and George Duckworth (107) both achieved the rare milestone of 100 dismissals in a season. Ames did even better in 1929, completing 128 dismissals, and in 1932 he completed 104. Ted Brooks achieved 75 dismissals six times. He was followed by Ames, Duckworth and Fred Price (five each); Harry Elliott and Arthur Wood (four each); Tich Cornford and Ben Lilley (three each); George Street (twice) and seven others at one apiece."]}]}}
