In December 1998, he joined St Mirren but would make just one substitute league appearance before joining Stranraer three months later. His stay at Stair Park lasted two-and-a-half years, where he managed 14 goals from 61 league appearances; his stay included a short loan spell with Queens Park. In 2001, he headed to Partick Thistle, where he spent two seasons, before a similar time with Greenock Morton. A year back at Stranraer followed, before a short-lived spell at Montrose. Walker signed for Ayr United in August 2006 before joining East Fife at the start of the 2007\u201308 season. After playing just once in the 2008\u201309 season, Walker moved to Junior level with Irvine Meadow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queen's Park F.C.", "response": ["The club's constitution was changed prior to the appointment of the next manager, which meant that Queen's could sign former professionals provided they were not paid by the club. Former Dundee manager John McCormack was unveiled in July 1998 as the new head coach. Like Eddie Hunter, McCormack succeeded in winning the league after just two seasons. The new boss used the new legislation to great effect and even persuaded the club to allow the loaning of professionals. The ex-pros and the committed amateurs combined to give Queen's a superb start to the league season and it was November before defeat was felt. A 4\u20130 loss to challengers Forfar Athletic towards the end of the season was quickly forgotten as Queen's won their last five matches, clinching the Championship at Cowdenbeath on the final day of 1999\u20132000. The addition of ex-pros such as Neil Inglis, Paul Martin, Graham Connell and Johnny Whelan helped. The late loan signing of Paul Walker from Stranraer also proved to be very shrewd as he scored two winning goals in the final run-in. After nearly 20 years of service to the club, Ross Caven won a Championship medal and there was also success for the hard-working Danny Ferry who had been with Queen's through the lean spells of the 90s."]}, {"page": "Paul Walker (disambiguation)", "response": ["Paul Walker (1973\u22122013) was an American actor.
