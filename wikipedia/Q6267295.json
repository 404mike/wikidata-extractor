The only new signings he could afford to make were free signings John Allen from Leicester City and Trevor Brissett from Stoke City. Vale exited the FA Cup at the Third Round following a humiliating 3\u20130 defeat to non-league side Enfield. They initially struggled away from home, but built their league campaign on results at Vale Park.

He sold goalkeeper Trevor Dance to non-league Stafford Rangers for \u00a310,000, as Harrison was in good form.

The Vale consistently lost away from home, but turned Vale Park into a fortress with four successive wins in Burslem. Despite this, attendances remained barely above 2,000.

Four victories in five games then put Vale into seventh place, and Colin Tartt was signed from Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Sheffield United in front of the television cameras was the first of a run of four defeats in five games, and sent an injury-hit Vale down into mid-table.

Vale then went on a fifteen match unbeaten run in the league, and between 20 January and 6 March the team went on a club-record six consecutive home draws. Stoke City offered \u00a3100,000 plus incentives for Mark Chamberlain, but Chairman Don Ratcliffe called the offer 'an insult' and rejected it out of hand. Instead Tony Sealy arrived on loan, this time from Queens Park Rangers. On 6 February Mark Chamberlain scored a memorable goal at Field Mill when he stood off the pitch to avoid being caught offside, then returned to tackle a startled Rod Arnold and tap the ball into an empty net. Mansfield Town manager Stuart Boam was so enraged that the goal stood that he raced onto the pitch to verbally abuse the linesman. In March, Johnny Miller had to retire with a knee injury. On 20 March, Mark Harrison conceded 'a crazy goal' from Hull City left-back Dennis Booth at Boothferry Park, whose fifty yard free kick hit the back of the net after several bounces. Injuries hit the Vale squad and the promotion campaign faded away.
