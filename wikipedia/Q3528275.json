He then went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, and earned his blue as a freshman, captaining the University in 1927.He played his county cricket for Leicestershire, captaining the county for four seasons. He toured with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to South Africa in 1927\u201328 and New Zealand in 1929\u201330.  He made 55 in his last Test, at Auckland, opening the innings with Ted Bowley.  He scored 12,598 first-class runs with 14 centuries, the highest being a knock of 146 against Gloucestershire.  His swansong was a chanceless 91 against the Australians in 1934.\nAs a member of the Coldstream Guards during World War II, his duties included guarding Rudolf Hess in Sussex. In his later years he was a creative director of the Outward Bound movement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Eddie Dawson"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Eddie Dawson \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Matt Henderson (cricketer)", "response": ["Henderson's only Test appearance was the first Test ever played by New Zealand, against the England team led by Harold Gilligan at Christchurch in January 1930, when he was 34. He dismissed Eddie Dawson with his first deliveryWicket with first ball in Test cricket and later took the wicket of K. S. Duleepsinhji, the top scorer. But New Zealand lost in two days and he was replaced for the Second Test by his Wellington team-mate, the all-rounder Eddie McLeod."]}, {"page": "Alfred Goulder", "response": ["Born in Attercliffe, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, Goulder was a left arm orthodox spinner and left-handed tail end batsman, who made his debut against an 'All England XI' at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, at the end of July 1929.  He did not bat as Alan Barber (100) and Edgar Oldroyd (143) put on 203 for the second wicket, to help Yorkshire post 320 for 4.  He bowled 11 overs and took the wickets of Eddie Dawson and Alan Shipman for 21, before rain forced the abandonment of the final day's play.  His second, and final game, was the County Championship clash against Derbyshire again at Bramall Lane, in August.  Batting at number eleven, he fell leg before wicket to Tommy Mitchell for three runs, and his only success with the ball came when he dismissed Stan Worthington, caught by Frank Dennis, for six.  He finished with a first-class career bowling average of 30.00."]}, {"page": "Edward Dawson", "response": ["* Eddie Dawson (1904\u20131979), cricketer", "* Eddie Dawson (footballer) (1913\u20131970), English football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "South American cricket team in England in 1932", "response": ["The match against MCC at Lord's was a two-day game.

On the tour of England in 1932, his batting was not very successful in the six first-class matches, and his highest score was only 34. His bowling was better and he took 19 wickets in first-class games, with a best of five for 48 as he and his brother, Dennet Ayling, bowled the South American team to victory over Sir Julien Cahn's side at Nottingham.

His own performances did not equal those of 1922, but nor did they fall much short: he made at least 500 runs in each season and his season average only once dipped below 15 runs per innings. His only century for Leicestershire was an innings of 104 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1923. In that match and in others until the emergence of Eddie Dawson, Berry and Shipman as regular opening batsmen, Fowke opened the innings, but later he dropped down the batting order to No 6 or No 7, and sometimes even lower. He missed a few matches in 1926 through a leg strain, but otherwise maintained fitness through to the end of the 1927 season, when he played in 29 first-class matches, more than in any other season, and then retired."]}, {"page": "John de Lisle (cricketer)", "response": ["None of the rest of de Lisle's cricketing career lived up to the promise of this first appearance. In 1924, he reappeared for Leicestershire in two games but scored only seven runs in three innings. From 1925, he moved back to England and became a stockbroker with a firm working on the Birmingham Stock Exchange. In 1930, Leicestershire, short of a captain because of the unavailability of Eddie Dawson, appointed de Lisle as captain for the season. The move was not a success: although Leicestershire began the season well, performances fell away badly and de Lisle himself managed only 363 runs in 30 matches at an average of just 8.85, and with a top score of only 28. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack commented that de Lisle \"possessed no special ability as a run-getter and, having only recently returned from India, lacked intimate knowledge of first-class cricket\". Dawson returned as captain in 1931 and de Lisle did not play again."]}, {"page": "Charles Packe (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1932, Leicestershire struggled to find an amateur to captain the team; the 1931 captain, Eddie Dawson was not available and played only once, and the captain from 1921, Aubrey Sharp, was approached but also was able to play only once. Although no formal appointment was made, Packe, home from the army for the first two-thirds of the season, played in 15 matches as captain, one of six amateurs to captain the team at some stage during the season. Even then, Packe's commitment to Leicestershire was not total: the team's most abject defeat of the season came in the match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge when the side was dismissed twice in 160 minutes of batting time by Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, bowling unchanged. Packe missed the debacle because he was playing for the Army cricket team against a touring South American side. Packe's own record as a batsman was modest, with 451 runs in county matches at an average of 18.79, and three scores of more than 50. He left regular cricket before the end of the 1932 season, but reappeared in five games for Leicestershire in 1934."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Eddie Dawson (1927/28\u20131934) : E.
