He began his career in the Football League at Crystal Palace, before transferring to Brentford in 1999. Upon his release from Brentford, Graham embarked on a nomadic career in non-League football. He represented Northern Ireland U21 at international level. He was known by the nickname \"Ginge\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nevin Saroya", "response": ["Saroya started his career at Brentford as a youth player and after completing his apprenticeship, he signed a professional contract for the club. He made his debut for Brentford in their 1\u20131 draw in the Football League Second Division with Oxford United on 22 April 2000, replacing Gareth Graham as a substitute in the 46th minute. After Brentford manager-owner Ron Noades released Saroya in 2001, he admitted he became \"disillusioned\" with football and stopped playing, despite interest from Conference clubs. Saroya was unemployed for six-months, until he was asked by Wally Downes to help the actors in Mean Machine with their fitness and skills; saying \"I had always got on well with him [Downes], so he asked me if I would come down here to Yeading and help the actors get fit and show them a few ball skills\". Saroya also appeared in the film, and says the other actors and Vinnie Jones \"pushed him\" to get back into football before an old school friend invited him to train at Yeading."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Gareth Graham", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gareth Graham", "| Gareth Graham", "| Gareth Graham"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Gareth Graham", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Gareth Graham", "| Gareth Graham"]}]}}
