He was the son of Sir Charles Abraham Elton, 6th Baronet.He was appointed High Sheriff of Somerset for 1857.Elected as Member of Parliament for Bath at the 1857 general election, he lost his seat in the House of Commons at the 1859 general election because of his opposition to Lord Palmerston's policy on China.Having inherited from his father both the title and the family's manor house, Clevedon Court in Somerset, he spent the rest of his life improving the town of Clevedon, setting up a lending library and allotments, and building and funding the local cottage hospital (which is still in existence). The west wing of the house was largely destroyed by a fire in 1882 and rebuilt. The house is now owned by the National Trust. He also built Hallum Hall on Dial Hill which was an orphanage. It was later renamed St Edith's children's home and remained in use as a children's home until 1974.  The gothic Victorian building is listed and remains largely intact on the outside, but is now converted to luxury flats.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1818", "response": ["* April 19 \u2013 Sir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet, English writer, Liberal Party politician (d. 1883)"]}, {"page": "1883", "response": ["* October 14 \u2013 Sir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet, English writer and Liberal Party politician (b. 1818)"]}, {"page": "Clevedon", "response": ["In 1863, Sir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet of Clevedon Court was largely responsible for the creation of the Clevedon Waterworks Company, which had built the first water works and sewage treatment works in Clevedon by 1867. Features included reservoirs to the north of Dial Hill and Old Street pumping station. As the population increased, the water works proved inadequate and a new pumping station was created on Tickenham Road in 1901, some  to the north-east. The new site could be seen from Clevedon Court, and the 8th Baronet, Sir Edmund Elton, took exception to the designs of the engineer James Mansergh. The Waterworks Company employed the architect Henry Dare Bryan to improve the appearance of the buildings, which included the pumping station, a coal shed and store, a lodge for the foreman, and the boundary wall and gates. The original pumping station was reused as a fire station. The new pumping station contained a vertical triple-expansion engine manufactured by the Scottish company Glenfield and Kennedy. This was upgraded to a Marshal horizontal compound engine in 1916, in turn replaced in 1938, when a steam turbine was fitted. The boiler house, engine house and chimney are grade II listed, as largely unaltered buildings in Domestic Revival style, with the interior retaining its glazed tiling and elaborate roof trusses, although the machinery has been replaced by modern equipment, and the site is still operational. Clevedon Waterworks Company were one of the first of the smaller waterworks in the region to amalgamate with Bristol Water, which occurred on 1 January 1953.", "*Sir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet (1818\u20131884), politician and local benefactor"]}, {"page": "Clevedon Court", "response": ["Sir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet, inherited the house and title in 1853 and, like his father, was a writer.
