His early training and enterprising temper produced in adult life an ambition to propagate Christianity and suppress the slave trade in Africa. He attached himself to the British Anti-Slavery Society, and under its auspices he went out to Malta, where he took part in the editing of a newspaper and also engaged in the study of the Arabic language and of geography, with a view to systematic exploration.Richardson made an expedition in 1845 from Tunis and Tripoli in Libya to Ghadames and Ghat in the middle of the Sahara.  Here he collected information about the Tuareg and arrived after nine months back again in Tripoli.  After he had published Travels into the great desert of Sahara (2 Books. London 1849), he succeeded to convince the British government to equip an expedition into Sudan and to Lake Chad. In March 1850 Richardson went for the second time to Ghat accompanied by Heinrich Barth and Adolf Overweg.  His party were the first Europeans to cross the stony elevated plain of the Hammada.  James Richardson died of unknown illness on this journey on 4 March 1851 in Ngurutua, a six-day journey away from Kukawa near Lake Chad.  His travel notes and diaries were published by Bayle Saint John as Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa (1853) and Travels in Morocco (1859).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 4", "response": ["*1851 \u2013 James Richardson, English explorer (b. 1809)"]}, {"page": "Niger", "response": ["In the 19th century Europeans began to take a greater interest in Africa; several European explorers travelled in the area of modern Niger, such as Mungo Park (in 1805\u201306), the Oudney-Denham-Clapperton expedition (1822\u201325), Heinrich Barth (1850\u201355; with James Richardson and Adolf Overweg), Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs (1865\u201367), Gustav Nachtigal (1869\u201374) and Parfait-Louis Monteil (1890\u201392)."]}, {"page": "Boston, Lincolnshire", "response": ["* James Richardson (1809\u20131851) explored Africa,Works by James Richardson, Project Gutenberg retrieved 19 January 2018 published his travel notes and diaries "]}, {"page": "Tuareg people", "response": ["In the mid-19th century descriptions of the Tuareg and their way of life were made by the English traveller James Richardson in his journeys across the Libyan Sahara in 1845\u20131846.TRAVELS IN THE GREAT DESERT OF SAHARA, IN THE YEARS OF 1845 AND 1846 CONTAINING A NARRATIVE OF PERSONAL ADVENTURES, DURING A TOUR OF NINE MONTHS THROUGH THE DESERT, AMONGST THE TOUARICKS AND OTHER TRIBES OF SAHARAN PEOPLE; INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF THE OASES AND CITIES OF GHAT, GHADAMES, AND MOURZUK BY JAMES RICHARDSON Project Gutenberg Release Date: July 17, 2007 [EBook #22094] Last Updated: April 7, 2018"]}, {"page": "James Richardson", "response": ["James Richardson may refer to:", "*James Richardson (Liberal politician) (1846\u20131921), Liberal Member of Parliament for Armagh", "*James Richardson (political consultant) (born 1984), Republican political strategist", "*James Richardson (darts player) (born 1974), English darts player", "*James Richardson (footballer) (1885\u20131951), Scottish footballer for Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday, and Ayr United", "*James Richardson Spensley (1867\u20131915), English doctor, footballer and manager, considered to be the father of football in Italy", "*James Richardson (cricketer) (1903\u20131995), English cricketer", "*James Richardson (Cisco), Canadian businessman with Cisco Systems", "*James Richardson (explorer) (1809\u20131851), British explorer of the Sahara", "*James Richardson (poet) (born 1950), American poet", "*James Richardson, owner of Spadina Hotel, Toronto", "*James Richardson (presenter) (born 1966), British television presenter associated with Italian football", "*James Richardson (1819\u20131892), Canadian businessman", "*James Richardson Corporation, Australian corporation involved with furniture, hospitality, real estate, and the duty-free retail businesses"]}, {"page": "Heinrich Barth", "response": ["Christian Bunsen, the Prussian ambassador to Westminster, encouraged the appointment of scholars, including Barth and Adolf Overweg, a Prussian astronomer, to the expedition of James Richardson, an explorer of the Sahara.

I must now consider myself recovered from indisposition. At first, people talked so much about Mourzuk fever that I thought I must have it as a matter of course\u00a0... Three-fourths of the Europeans who come here invariably have the fever. I speak of the Turks.

At Kufra, the Egyptian traveller Ahmed Hassanein Bey found out in 1916 that he could buy a girl slave for five pounds sterling while in 1923 he found that the price had risen to 30 to 40 pounds sterling. Another traveler, the Danish convert to Islam Knud Holmboe, crossed the Italian Libyan desert in 1930, and was told that slavery is still practiced in Kufra and that he could buy a slave girl for 30 pounds sterling at the Thursday slave market. According to James Richardson's testimony, when he visited Ghadames, most slaves were from Bornu. According to Ra\u00ebd Bader, based on estimates of the Trans-Saharan trade, between 1700 and 1880 Tunisia received 100,000 black slaves, compared to only 65,000 entering Algeria, 400,000 in Libya, 515,000 in Morocco and 800,000 in Egypt.
