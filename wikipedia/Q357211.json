Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California\" was said to be written about Robert Plant and Jimmy Page's infatuation with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says \"Joni\" after the line \"To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings\". Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The Sonic Youth song \"Hey Joni\" is named for Mitchell. Alanis Morissette also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs, \"Your House\". British folk singer Frank Turner mentions Mitchell in his song \"Sunshine State\". The Prince song \"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" contains the lyric \u2013 \" 'Oh, my favorite song' she said \u2013 and it was Joni singing 'Help me I think I'm falling' \". \"Lavender\" by Marillion was partly influenced by \"going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell\", according to vocalist and lyricist Fish, and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song \"Montreal\" from Sounds That Can't Be Made. John Mayer makes reference to Mitchell and her Blue album in his song \"Queen of California\", from his 2012 album Born and Raised.

Stills and Crosby had been friends since the early 1960s; Nash had first met Crosby in the mid-1960s when The Byrds toured the UK, and he renewed the friendship when The Hollies toured the US in mid-1968. By this time creative tensions within The Hollies were coming to a head, and Nash had already decided to leave the group. Fate intervened during the Hollies US tour, when Nash reunited with Crosby and met Stephen Stills (ex-Buffalo Springfield) at a party at the Los Angeles home of Cass Elliott in July 1968. After Crosby and Stills sang Stills' new composition \"You Don't Have To Cry\" that evening, Nash asked them to repeat it, and chimed in with an impromptu third harmony part. The trio's unique vocal chemistry was instantly apparent, so when Nash quit the Hollies in August 1968 and relocated to Los Angeles, the three immediately formed a trio, Crosby, Stills & Nash.

The signing was complicated by the fact that Nash was still under contract to Epic Records (The Hollies' US distributor), but Ertegun used his diplomatic prowess to overcome this by arranging a 'swap' \u2013 he released former Buffalo Springfield member Richie Furay from his Atlantic contract, allowing Furay's new group Poco to sign to Epic, and in exchange Columbia Records (the parent company of Epic) allowed Nash to sign to Atlantic. In the event, Ertegun and Atlantic were the clear winners. Poco achieved moderate success for Epic, but Crosby, Stills & Nash's self-titled debut album (released in May 1969) became a huge and enduring hit, reaching #6 on the Billboard album chart, spawning two US Top 40 singles, becoming a multi-platinum seller and eventually earning a place in the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."]}, {"page": "Bobby Seale", "response": ["*The 1971 the song \"Chicago\"  written by Graham Nash refers to Seale being bound and gagged during the trial.

The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, Time Fades Away (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's Official Release Series). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. Time Fades Away, for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. Time was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of Harvest. These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time."]}, {"page": "Tonio K", "response": ["In the early 1970s, Krikorian recorded two albums with Buddy Holly's original band, The Crickets.
