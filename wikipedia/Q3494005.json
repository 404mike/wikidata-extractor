In medical genetics, he worked with Sir Cyril Clarke on Rh disease.\nHe was born on 27 July 1921 in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England and attended Marlborough College from 1935 to 1939.\n\n1940 to 1945 - Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (prisoner-of-war from 1942 to 1945).

They also worked on Rh disease.\nIn 1961 Sheppard started a colony of scarlet tiger moths by the Wirral Way, West Kirby, Merseyside, which were rediscovered in 1988 by Cyril Clarke, who continued to observe them in his retirement to study changes in the moth population.\nSheppard married Patricia Beatrice Lee in 1948.
