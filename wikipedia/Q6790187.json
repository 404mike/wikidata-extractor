Despite the success of his Swan Lake, in which he altered the traditional story to be about a human male falling in love with a male swan, Bourne acknowledged the challenge of a gay Romeo and Juliet. \"It's more to do with dancing than with sexuality,\" he said \"A male dancer, whether gay or straight, fits into a relationship with a female partner very happily. It's something you're taught, and it fits, it feels right, the lifting and all that stuff. Getting away from that, making a convincing love duet, a romantic, sexual duet, for two men that is comfortable to do and comfortable to watch\u2013I don't know if you can.

I was meant to re-record my voice over his sounds, but he sent back what he heard on the harmonium \u2013 the chords, the keys, the silences, the breaths in and out \u2013 and it was just like, wow.
