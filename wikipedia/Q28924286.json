He was born in Ratnagiri in British India in 1851, the son of George and Letitia Coles. He grew up in India until he was sent to King's College School in London. He went on to study at the Royal Indian Civil Engineering College at Cooper's Hill near Egham in Surrey.Coles made his debut for Kent in 1873 against Sussex at Lord's in the only match which took place in the \"County Championship Cup\", an experimental competition organised by MCC. On a pitch that Wisden reported as \"dangerously bad\", Coles took six wickets in the Sussex first innings and four in the second as he \"repeatedly struck the batsmen\" and \"battered the batsmen into submission\". He made one further appearance for Kent against Surrey later in the same season and played in one non-first-class match for the Gentlemen of Kent against I Zingari during the same year's Canterbury Cricket Week. He lived in Tunbridge Wells and played some cricket for Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club and Bluemantle's.Coles returned to India soon after his summer of cricket and worked in the Indian Public Works Department throughout his life. He married in West Bengal in 1893 and had one son. Coles died at Naini Tal in the country in 1903 aged 52.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Indian Engineering College", "response": ["*George Coles (Kent cricketer), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Coles (surname)", "response": ["* Fenton George Coles (b. 1937), Welsh rugby player", "* George Coles (cricketer, born 1798) (1798\u20131865), English amateur cricketer", "* George Coles (politician) (1810\u20131875), Canadian politician; first Premier of Prince Edward Island", "* George Coles (architect) (1884\u20131963), English architect"]}, {"page": "George Coles (Cambridge University cricketer)", "response": ["George Coles (christened 19 October 1798 \u2013 22 January 1865) was an English amateur cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1819 to 1820 for Cambridge University Cricket Club.", "Educated at Eton and Peterhouse, Cambridge, George Coles later became ordained as a Church of England clergyman.
