Restoration projects in this period included the Scuola Levantina in the Venetian Ghetto, the church of the Gesuiti in Cannaregio, and the cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta on the island of Torcello (the latter in partnership with Venice in Peril and the IFM). Tintoretto's massive Paradise, the largest Old Master painting on canvas in the world, was a significant restoration too, the first of many conservation treatments to benefit this artist. During this period SVI also began to fund local restorers and researchers as well as to support a conservation laboratory run by the Superintendency of Fine Arts."]}]}}
