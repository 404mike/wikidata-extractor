He was chief engineer on the first three solo albums by Pete Townshend, including Empty Glass and White City: A Novel.\nHe contributed to documentaries about The Clash such as Westway To The World. Price started his engineering career in the mid-1960s when he was an engineer at Decca Studios in West Hampstead, recording artists such as Tom Jones.\nOne of the final recordings he helped engineer at Decca before departing to AIR Studios in November 1969 was the multi-million-selling \"Reflections of My Life\" by The Marmalade.\nPrice helped build AIR Studios in Oxford Street, where he spent many years. During that time he engineered some of the major albums of the 1970s and 1980s, including the Sex Pistols' Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, and mixed Nilsson's \"Without You\".\nHe was the chief engineer/manager at Wessex Studios, the London studio where the Clash and the Sex Pistols recorded much of their work.\nMore recently he worked again with Mick Jones in his band Carbon/Silicon, and mixed the Veils' albums Nux Vomica and Time Stays, We Go.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London Calling", "response": ["* Bill Price\u00a0\u2013 engineer", "*\"London Calling\" By The Clash Mix Magazine, 2000 \u2013 Very detailed article with recording setup details from the album's engineer, Bill Price."]}, {"page": "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols", "response": ["The band's internal relationships were always volatile, and the lineup saw changes during the recording of the album.  Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only performed bass on \"Anarchy in the U.K.\".  Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs the band wrote after he joined.  While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead.  Drummer Paul Cook and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track.  The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers.", "Close to completing a deal with A&M Records, in March 1977 the Sex Pistols entered Wessex Sound Studios to record with producer Chris Thomas and engineer Bill Price. New bassist Sid Vicious played on the tracks \"Bodies\" and \"God Save the Queen\", but his performing skills were not considered fit to record the full album, so the band asked manager Malcolm McLaren to convince previous bassist Glen Matlock to perform the instrument for the sessions. Matlock agreed on the condition that he was paid beforehand. When payment was not received, he declined to attend. As a result, Thomas asked guitarist Steve Jones to play bass so work could begin on the basic tracks. Jones' playing was so satisfactory that Thomas had him play the bass tracks for all the remaining songs recorded during the sessions.", "*Bill Price \u2013 engineering, co-production", "Category:Albums produced by Bill Price (record producer)"]}, {"page": "William Price", "response": ["William Price, Will Price, Bill Price, or Billy Price may refer to:", "* William S.
