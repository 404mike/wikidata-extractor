Shonfield's argument that planning allows public authority to control and direct private enterprise without taking ownership of it as the socialists proposed have made him one of the better-known advocates of a mixed economy.\nShonfield also worked as a journalist. He was the foreign editor of The Financial Times from 1950 until 1958, then worked as The Observer's economic editor.\nHe was close to the Labour Party and served first as Director of Studies (1961\u201368) and then as Director (1972\u201377) of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, usually known as Chatham House. He was a member of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations (the Donovan Commission) which reported in 1968. He headed the Social Science Research Council (now ESRC) between 1969 and 1971. In 1972, he lectured on the consequences of Britain's entry in the European Community in the BBC's Reith Lectures.  During the final three years of his life he was Professor of Economics at the European University Institute in Florence. In 1970 he was elected a fellow of Imperial College London. He was knighted in the 1978 New Year Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Wilson", "response": ["The government's decision over its first three years to defend sterling's parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth. The National Plan produced by the DEA in 1965 targeted an annual growth rate of 3.8%, however, under the restrained circumstances the actual average rate of growth between 1964 and 1970 was a far more modest 2.2%. The DEA itself was wound up in 1969. The government's other main initiative Mintech did have some success at switching research and development spending from military to civilian purposes, and of achieving increases in industrial productivity, although persuading industry to adopt new technology proved more difficult than had been hoped.

Wilson built on foundations that had been laid by his Conservative predecessors, in the shape, for example, of the National Economic Development Council (known as \"Neddy\") and its regional counterparts (the \"little Neddies\"). Government intervention in industry was greatly enhanced, with the National Economic Development Office greatly strengthened and the number of \"little Neddies\" was increased, from eight in 1964 to twenty-one in 1970. The government's policy of selective economic intervention was later characterised by the establishment of a new super-ministry of technology, a connexion not always publicly grasped, under Tony Benn.The Labour Government 1964\u201370 by Brian Lapping."]}, {"page": "Mixed economy", "response": ["The American system initially proposed by the first United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and supported by later US leaders such as Henry Clay, John C Calhoun, and Daniel Webster exhibited the traits of a mixed economy combining protectionism, laissez-faire, and infrastructure spending. By 1914 and the start of World War I Germany had developed a mixed economy with government co-ownership of infrastructure and industry along with a comprehensive social welfare system. After the 1929 stock crash and subsequent Great Depression threw much of the global economy into a severe economic decline, British economists such as John Maynard Keynes began to advocate for economic theories which argued for more government intervention in the economy. Harold Macmillan, a conservative politician in the British Tory Party also began to advocate for a mixed economy in his books Reconstruction (1933) and The Middle Way (1938). Supporters of the mixed economy, included R. H. Tawney, Anthony Crosland and Andrew Shonfield who were mostly associated with the Labour Party. During the post-war period and coinciding Golden Age of Capitalism, there was general worldwide rejection of laissez-faire economics as capitalist countries embraced mixed-economies founded on economic planning, intervention, and welfare."]}, {"page": "Reith Lectures", "response": ["* 1972 Andrew Shonfield, Europe: Journey to an Unknown Destination"]}, {"page": "Encounter (magazine)", "response": ["The economic sclerosis of the 1970s, afflicting all the world's advanced democracies with a corrosive blend of decade-long inflation, sector-wide industrial strikes, overburdened welfare states expanded under pressure of an affluence-driven \"revolution of rising expectations\", the overturning of the supremacy of Keynesian economics under a simultaneous inflation and recession long thought inconceivable, and the resulting unraveling of the postwar, bipartisan social-democratic consensus \u2013 such was the stuff of a good portion of the debate on domestic affairs within Encounter throughout the 1970s.
