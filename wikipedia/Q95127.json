McCoy stated that he saw Radagast as \"very otherworldly with, as Tolkien depicts him, an empathy and kinship with nature, a Middle-earth version of St Francis of Assisi\". McCoy added that while Radagast was rather absent-minded, he comes out as \"a bumbling hero\". As for his house, McCoy said that the idea was that the tree decided to grow right through it, and Radagast agreed that he and the tree could live together. In the film, Radagast is the first wizard to visit Dol Guldur after he realizes that an evil power has infected the wood in which he lives. He discovers that a Necromancer (who turns out to be Sauron) has taken residence in the ruined fortress. In Dol Guldur he encounters the spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar, as well as the shadow of the Necromancer himself, and escapes with the Morgul blade taken from the Witch-king. Radagast's means of transportation is a sled pulled by enormous rabbits, a concept entirely original to the movie. Radagast meets Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the Dwarves en route to Erebor, and tells them of his discovery in Dol Guldur. When Thorin's Company are attacked by Orcs riding Wargs, Radagast mounts his sled and provides a distraction. Later, Saruman makes contemptuous remarks about Radagast during a meeting with Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel. The writer Brian Sibley comments that the fact that Tolkien said little about Radagast gave Jackson's screenwriters freedom to make of the character what they liked. The Economist wrote that Radagast the Brown had been created from Tolkien's \"sparse and bare\" hints as to his character."]}, {"page": "Goldberry", "response": ["The chapters involving the Old Forest and its characters were omitted from Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell's 1981 radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.

Moments of Symphony No. 5 and The Firebird he thought lacked the \"abstract grace\" from Toccata and Fugue from the original, and Pines of Rome was \"even less successful\" due to the computer imagery which affected its quality. He claims Rhapsody in Blue is \"guilty of some dubious racial and sexual caricaturing\", but hailed the film's IMAX presentation as \"a breathtaking spectacle\". He summarized the film as \"slightly more successful\" than the original Fantasia, more child-friendly and a \"mixed bag of delights\". Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote a positive review of the film, citing Pines of Rome as \"a superb, uplifting flight of the spirit\" and Piano Concerto No. 2 \"a gorgeous blend of traditional and computer animation\". He drew a comparison to The Firebird with the 1997 Japanese animated film Princess Mononoke. Brian Sibley wrote a mostly negative review in Sight & Sound, a monthly magazine published by the British Film Institute, in June 2000. He pointed out that though the film includes moments of comedy and pastoral, \"the themes running through the old 'Fantasia' \u2013 the struggle between light and dark, the war between chaos and order, the ultimate triumph of goodness \u2013 find only a pale equivalent in this new version\". He compared the film's orchestra set to scenes from A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and thought the CGI in Symphony No. 5 lacked the technical qualities of Toy Story. Sibley argued the film lacked an even quality, highlighting Pines of Rome with its \"breathtaking\" opening before \"its magic has been overtaken by chronic boredom\" when the baby whale reunites with his parents. Pomp and Circumstance, he thought, contained \"shamefully sloppy animation\" but is saved by Donald's comical gags, but pointed out Rhapsody in Blue, with its \"strong lines and vivid, flat colours that are fashionably retro\", and the \"classic Disneyesque\u00a0... exquisite beauty and raw natural violence\" in Firebird Suite, as the film's most successful segments as they \"ironically, hark back to older times\"."]}, {"page": "The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)", "response": ["The script by Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell attempts to be as faithful as possible to the original novel, but there are some errors and alterations.
