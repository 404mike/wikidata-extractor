After Wesley's death, his teachings on Christian perfection remained important to the Methodist church, but, according to historian David Bebbington, \"the tradition fell into decay.\" As later generations of Methodists sought greater respectability in the eyes of other Christian denominations, some turned to \"a watered-down version\" of the doctrine outlined by William Arthur (who served as Secretary of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society) in his popular work The Tongue of Fire, published in 1856. While Arthur encouraged readers to pray for a greater experience of the Holy Spirit, he de-emphasized the instantaneous aspect of Christian perfection. According to Bebbington, this eliminated the distinctiveness of Wesleyan entire sanctification, and by the 1860s, the idea that Christian perfection was a decisive second blessing or stage in Christian sanctification had fallen out of favor among some Methodists, though not all Methodists, as academic institutions affiliated with mainline Methodism such as Asbury Theological Seminary, Methodist camp meetings, and other Holiness Methodist associations within the Church continued to be a beacon for the holiness movement."]}, {"page": "Wrington", "response": ["*Samuel Budgett (1794\u20131851), wholesale grocer, Wesleyan Methodist, philanthropist and subject of a popular biography, was born in Wrington.William Arthur: The Successful Merchant (London, 1852)."]}, {"page": "William Arthur", "response": ["William Arthur may refer to:", "* William Arthur (botanist) (fl. 1715), Scottish botanist", "* William Arthur (minister) (1819\u20131901), Wesleyan Methodist minister and author", "* William Arthur (mathematician) (1894\u20131979), British mathematician", "* William Arthur (Royal Navy) (1830\u20131886), British naval officer"]}, {"page": "Samuel Budgett", "response": ["Shortly after his death a biography \u2013 The Successful Merchant, by William Arthur \u2013 was published which went into over forty editions in the UK alone and made him well known.
