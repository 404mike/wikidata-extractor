He also won an All Star Award for his performances in the 2004 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.\nFrom Ballinderry, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, Muldoon announced his retirement from playing club football for Ballinderry Shamrocks on 13 November 2017. He was instrumental in helping Ballinderry win the 2002 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, and he has also won six Derry Championships and an Ulster Senior Club Football Championship with the club.\nMuldoon was a versatile player who could play anywhere in the forward line or in midfield. Described by Joe Brolly as \"the greatest ever natural talent to have played with Derry\", his repertoire of skills include his catching ability, scoring prowess, confidence on the ball, positional awareness and in particular his great passing capabilities.\nDespite often playing in the half forward line or midfield, Muldoon has consistently been a high scorer for Derry. He finished the 2001 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship with 2\u201310 (16) and the 2004 Championship with 3\u201324 (33). He finished the 2006 campaign with 1-07 (10) from two matches. His tally of 12 Championship goals is one of the highest ever in Ulster football history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Muldoon", "response": ["* Enda Muldoon, Gaelic footballer"]}, {"page": "Ulster GAA", "response": ["| Enda Muldoon"]}, {"page": "List of All Stars Awards winners (football)", "response": ["| FF || 20px|border Enda Muldoon || Derry || 1"]}, {"page": "Ulster Senior Football Championship", "response": ["| Enda Muldoon"]}, {"page": "2004 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship", "response": ["| Enda Muldoon"]}, {"page": "Ballinderry", "response": ["*Enda Muldoon - All Star Former Derry GAA footballer."]}, {"page": "Paddy Bradley", "response": ["In 2004, Bradley (2-38) and Enda Muldoon (3-24) contributed nearly 70% of Derry's total of 7-92 (113 points) in that year's Championship.
