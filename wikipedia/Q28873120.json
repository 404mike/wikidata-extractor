In the Preface of Vol. 1 he lists 19 people to whom he is indebted. These include: Rev Pollexfen and Dr McBain for Orkney algae. The others are: Rev Hore, Dr Cocks, Mr Rohloff, Mr Boswarva, Miss White, Miss Magdalene Turner, Miss Warren, Miss (Anne) Ball, Miss (Isabella) Gifford(4), Miss Cutler (1), Mrs Gatty, Mrs Gulson (?\u20131871)(5), Mrs Hayden, Rev Dr Landsborough, Dr Dickie (2), Mr Ralfs and Mr Cresswell.
