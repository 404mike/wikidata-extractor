The broad petals also have a dark medial stripe and dark spots towards the base and the flower bends slightly downwards. The lip is pale yellow and channeled at the base. It was introduced into Europe and many hybrids were developed by horticulturists. Harry Veitch produced a hybrid with Cypripedium niveum.
