Owen Wingrave was based, like The Turn of the Screw, on a ghost story by Henry James. By the 1960s Britten found composition much slower than in his prolific youth; he told the 28-year-old composer Nicholas Maw, \"Get as much done now as you can, because it gets much, much more difficult as you grow older.\" He did not complete the score of the new opera until August 1970. Owen Wingrave was first broadcast in Britain in May 1971, when it was also televised in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and Yugoslavia.Evans, Peter. \"Britten's Television Opera\", The Musical Times, Volume 112, No. 1539, May 1971, pp. 425\u2013428 ", "Nicholas Maw said of Britten's vocal music: \"His feeling for poetry (not only English) and the inflexions of language make him, I think, the greatest musical realizer of English\". One of the best-known works in which Britten set poetry was the War Requiem (1962). It intersperses the Latin requiem mass, sung by soprano and chorus, with settings of works by the First World War poet Wilfred Owen, sung by tenor and baritone. At the end the two elements are combined, as the last line of Owen's \"Strange meeting\" mingles with the In paradisum of the mass. Matthews describes the conclusion of the work as \"a great wave of benediction [which] recalls the end of the Sinfonia da Requiem, and its similar ebbing away into the sea that symbolises both reconciliation and death.\" The same year, he composed A Hymn of St Columba for choir and organ, setting a poem by the 6th-century saint. Other works for voices and orchestra include the Missa Brevis and the Cantata academica (both 1959) on religious themes, Children's Crusade to a text by Bertolt Brecht about a group of children in wartime Poland, to be performed by children (1969), and the late cantata Phaedra (1975), a story of fated love and death modelled on Handel's Italian cantatas."]}, {"page": "Lullaby", "response": ["Chopin's \"Berceuse\" is a composition for solo piano.
