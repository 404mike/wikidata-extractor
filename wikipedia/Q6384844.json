Mark Weatherly took over as team captain, replacing Keith Oakes, who was only named as a substitute for the opening game of the season and left the club soon afterwards to join Fulham. Before the season began, a series of disputes took place involving the club's board of directors.  In late June, chairman Charles Cox announced that he had dismissed three directors from their posts; the following day, the ousted trio gave an interview to the press and claimed that under his chairmanship the club's debt had reached \u00a3700,000 and that it faced the threat of a potential liquidation order from the Inland Revenue. Four days later, following a showdown meeting between the two parties, Cox resigned as chairman and the three deposed directors returned to the board with one of them, Roy Wood, becoming the new chairman. The directors then issued a statement to Gillingham supporters stating that the club's finances were under control and that money would be available to manager Peacock to sign new players in anticipation of another challenge for promotion. In July, the club's financial director announced that a settlement had been reached with the Inland Revenue."]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1980s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Keith Oakes"]}]}}
