After principal photography was complete, Colbert told Negulesco \"You know I'm not given to exaggeration so I hope you believe me when I say that working with you has been the most stimulating and happiest experience of my entire career.\" She had broken her back while shooting for one of the violent scenes. However, during the final editing process, this particular scene was removed.  Another scene, showing Colbert's character conversing with a Japanese prison guard was also excised.  This was the first American film in which Hayakawa spoke his native Japanese language. While filming for the concentration camp scenes, Colbert did not apply any makeup. For the scenes which involved her crossing a barbed wire, she wore leather panties for her protection.  She also had to do dieting along with rest of the cast for being thinner. ", "\"Miss Colbert's performance is a beautifully modulated display of moods and passions and explosions under most inhuman and unnatural stress and strain. And Mr. Hayakawa's calculation of the Japanese colonel is a rare accomplishment. But Patric Knowles is also excellent as the British husband of Mrs. Keith from whom she is early separated, and Florence Desmond is superb as a cheerful inmate in the prison camp. Indeed, a little fellow named Mark Keuning contributes immeasurably, too, as the 4-year-old son of the author to whom she desperately clings through her ordeal.  Played against realistic settings, which vividly convey the meanness of the jungle prisons, and directed by Jean Negulesco for physical and emotional credibility, Three Came Home is a comprehensive film.
