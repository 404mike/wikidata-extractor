Peter Warlock was also asked to accept the Honorary Life Presidency of the Blackpool Magic Club after the death of the initial holder of that position, Edward Victor, which he did. He was followed in that distinction by Ken Dodd O.B.E.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Warlock", "response": ["Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 189417 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle.", "An event of considerable significance in Heseltine's musical life, late in 1916, was his introduction to the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren. This friendship considerably influenced Heseltine, who for the rest of his life continued to promote the older composer's music.Smith 1994, pp. 98\u201399 In November 1916 Heseltine used the pseudonym \"Peter Warlock\" for the first time, in an article on Sir Eugene Aynsley Goossens' chamber music for The Music Student.Smith 1994, pp. 103\u201304Parrott, p. 44", "When Heseltine returned to London at the end of August 1918 he sent seven of his new songs to Rogers for publication. Because of the recent contretemps over Van Dieren, Heseltine submitted these pieces as \"Peter Warlock\". They were published under this pseudonym, which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output, reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings. At around this time the composer Charles Wilfred Orr recalled Heseltine as \"a tall fair youth of about my own age\", trying without success to convince a sceptical Delius of the merits of Van Dieren's piano works. Orr was particularly struck by Heseltine's whistling abilities which he describes as  \"flute-like in quality and purity\".Palmer, pp. 174\u201375", "They [the differing elements] are fused together in a curiously personal way: the separate ingredients can be analysed and defined, but not the ultimate product, which is not Dowland plus Van Dieren or Elizabethan plus modern, but simply something wholly individual and unanalysable\u2014Peter Warlock. No one else could have written it.Gray 1934, p. 245", "After Heseltine's death, assessments of his musical stature were generous. Newman considered some of Heseltine's choral compositions \"among the finest music written for massed voices by a modern Englishman.\" Constant Lambert hailed him as \"one of the greatest song-writers that music has ever known\",Smith 1994, p. 289 a view echoed by Copley.Copley 1979, p. 265 In a tribute published in The Musical Times, Van Dieren referred to Heseltine's music as  \"a national treasure\" that would long survive all that was currently being said or written about it. In subsequent years his standing as a composer diminished; Brian Collins records how public perceptions of Warlock were distorted by the scandalous reports of his private life, so that his musical importance in the inter-war years became obscured. However, when the Peter Warlock Society was created in 1963, interest in his music began to increase. Collins acknowledges that the Warlock output includes much that can be dismissed as mere programme-fillers and encore items, but these do not detract from numerous works of the highest quality, \"frequently thrilling and passionate and, occasionally, innovative to the point of being revolutionary\".", "* (with Jack Lindsay) Loving Mad Tom: Bedlamite verses of the 16th and 17th centuries (1927).
