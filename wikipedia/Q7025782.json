M. Barrie's Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.  He was only a year old when Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up hit the stage in 1904, and as such was not a primary inspiration for the characters of Peter and the Lost Boys.  However he was eight years old when the novel adaptation Peter and Wendy was published, and in later editions of the play, the character Michael Darling's middle name was changed to \"Nicholas.\" He was the first cousin of the English writer Daphne du Maurier.", "link_mentions": {}}}
