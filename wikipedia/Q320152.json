His godmothers were Violet Trefusis, Olive Custance and Rosamund Grosvenor.The boys grew up at Sissinghurst Castle, in the rural depths of Kent, surrounded by the renowned gardens that are now run by the National Trust.  Nicolson was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, studying modern history. In 1939, he was appointed Deputy Surveyor of the King's Pictures under Kenneth Clark, but soon after, war was declared and he joined the Intelligence Corps, rising to the rank of captain. In 1945 he resumed his Royal post as Deputy Surveyor, then under Anthony Blunt.\nHe was married on 8 August 1955 to Luisa Felicita Vertova, the elder daughter of Professor Giacomo Vertova of Florence, and they had a daughter, Vanessa Pepita Giovanna (b. 1956), before divorcing in 1962.\nAfter being appointed a MVO, Nicolson resigned from the Royal Household in 1947 and went on to edit The Burlington Magazine. Nicolson spent much of his life collecting photographs of early seventeenth-century works in the Caravaggio manner which he wrote about in The Burlington Magazine and which eventually filled three large volumes.\nNicolson died in 1978 and was buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in Sissinghurst, Kent, adjacent to his father.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pompeo Batoni", "response": ["Pompeo Batoni was among the most celebrated Italian painters in his day, and his patrons and collectors included royals and aristocrats from all over Europe.

The Burlington Magazine, however, added to this late Victorian tradition of market-based criticism new elements of historical research inspired by the leading academic German periodicals and thus created a formula that has remained almost intact to date: a combination of archival and formalist object-based art historical research juxtaposed to articles on collectors\u2019 items and private collections, enlivened with notes on current art news, exhibitions and sales.A.
