Faye explores how issues of social class, employment and housing insecurity, police violence and prisons, and sex work affect transgender people. She aims to make a left-wing argument for how transgender liberation would improve society more widely. Faye, a professional journalist, wrote the book largely in the first English COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. She drew from Revolting Prostitutes and Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race in her writing, while reviews frequently contrasted it with Helen Joyce's Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality, which was published in the same year. It became a bestseller in The Sunday Times.", "Shon Faye is an English journalist who started her career as a lawyer. Her first public reporting as a transgender person was video journalism for Novara Media in 2016 and 2017. She later became editor-at-large for the magazine Dazed. The Transgender Issue was Faye's first book; it was released on 2 September 2021 by Allen Lane.", "Several reviews contrasted the book with Helen Joyce's Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality and Kathleen Stock's Material Girls, both published the same year. Sophie McBain of the New Statesman gave a comparative review of The Transgender Issue and Trans, concluding that \"if you find yourself nodding in agreement with Helen Joyce, I can only recommend that the next writer you read is Shon Faye\". McBain praised The Transgender Issue as \"a bracing and vital corrective to mainstream writing on trans rights\", but criticised \"self-defeating\" political positions such as opposition of increased police diversity. She believed that an exploration of how to prevent male violence would have improved the book."]}, {"page": "The Hidden Case of Ewan Forbes", "response": ["As a part of the Australian Book Review December 2021 issue, Yves Rees positively described the book's courtroom scenes as \"a tour de force of empathetic history\" and considered Playdon to be the \"ideal person\" to be writing on this history. Rees ultimately says that the book promises to \"do powerful work in service of trans liberation\" alongside other publications of 2021 such as Shon Faye's The Transgender Issue and Finn Mackay's Female Masculinities and the Gender Wars. Hugo Vickers as a reviewer for The Oldie complimented the ambitious nature of the book as a general trans history coverage of the past century interspersed with Forbes's life story, noting that he as a \"general reader\" would have gotten lost in the former without the latter to keep as a steady throughline of the book's historical plot. Giving the book a 4 out of 5 rating in The Daily Telegraph, Tanya Gold commented on just how \"typically British\" it is that the topic of the trans experience in Britain would end up being about the complicated and \"ever-fascinating prism\" of the class system of the country. Covering the book for The Law Society Gazette, Luke Williams pointed out that while the work may have a \"limited relevance to day-to-day practice\" for lawyers, the information regarding cases like Corbett v Corbett and their impact on the legal profession in the UK since is \"invaluable\" and those cases serve as a \"timely reminder of what can happen\" on a quote from the Forbes case judge discussed in the book that \"there are some interests that it is more important to protect than the rights of individuals\"."]}]}}
