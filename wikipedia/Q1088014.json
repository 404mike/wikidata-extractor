He abdicated in favour of his son Meurig (Maurice) and retired to live a hermitical life, but was recalled to lead his son's army against an intruding Saxon force. He won the battle, but was mortally wounded.\nThe context of the battle is one of Britons versus invading Saxons, without explicit religious overtones. Since Tewdrig held to a religious lifestyle and was killed while defending a Christian kingdom against pagans, by the standards of that day Tewdrig is considered to be a martyr and a saint. The Latin form of his name is given as 'Theodoric' and his feast day is 1 April. \nTewdrig's name appears in a genealogy of Jesus College MS 20, in the line of one of his descendants, but the only substantive information about the person comes from the twelfth century Book of Llandaff.\nThe Book of Llandaff places Tewdrig's story in the territory of the historical Kingdom of Gwent (the southeastern part of modern Monmouthshire), though it states that he was a king of Glywysing. The ancient histories of the kingdoms of Gwent and Glywysing are intertwined, and he may have ruled both kingdoms.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Theodoric", "response": ["*Saint Tewdrig (alternatively Tewdric or Theodoric) (c. 580 \u2013 c. 630), Welsh king of Gwent and Glywysing, who was martyred fighting the Saxons"]}, {"page": "St Tewdric's Church", "response": ["St Tewdric's Church is a Church in Wales parish church in Mathern, Monmouthshire, Wales.

As such, he was a prince in both the kingdoms of Glywysing and Gwent as his cousin Athrwys was king of Gwent. He became King of Glywysing in 785 succeeding his father Rhys ap Ithael. He married the daughter of Braustud ferch Glowd of the Kingdom of Buellt, with whom he had two sons Rhys ap Arthfael and Meureg ap Arthfael. Despite this success, historians noted that the Kingdom of Glywysing at the time was subdivided between Arthfael's cousins, nephews and uncles. Each one of them were de facto monarchs over smaller parts of the Kingdom. While Arthfael was recognised as the senior king within the realm, it is unlikely that he had any direct control or authority over his competing ruling family members within the kingdom of Glywysing."]}]}}
