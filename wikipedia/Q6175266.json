However, following the departure of Joe Royle and the arrival of Kevin Keegan, Dunfield found first-team opportunities hard to come by.

With only a minute of normal time left, and two goals behind in the game, many City fans considered that the game had been lost and began to make their way to the exits.   However, after Darren Carr had tackled Goater to deny him a goal-scoring opportunity, Horlock scored from the rebound for City to halve the deficit in the 90th minute.  In the fifth minute of injury time, Wiekens punted the ball forward, Horlock and Goater helped it on to Dickov who scored an equalising goal.  The regulation 90 minutes ended moments later, and with the scores level the game went into extra time.  Dickov saw his header gathered by Bartram and although Hodge's cross was blocked by Jeff Whitley's hand, no penalty was awarded.
