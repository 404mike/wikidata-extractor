He played a bit part in their first league title triumph in the following season. The departure of Andrew Hannah to Renton that summer gave McLean his chance to establish himself as the regular first choice right back at the club, although the club were unable to repeat the form of the previous year, finishing fifth. A summer of off the field turmoil followed in which directors, staff and players alike were forced to choose sides in a rent dispute over Anfield Road, which saw the club literally split in two.", "Everton moved out, along with the vast majority of their players, staff and officials, but McLean was one of only two first-teamers who chose to stay and help form the new club, Liverpool. His decision may have been a reaction to the news that Andrew Hannah was on his way back to Merseyside, which could have signalled McLean's drop back into the reserves but as fate would have it Hannah also chose the new club over his former employers with the result that Hannah and McLean became Liverpool's first ever back line partnership. At Liverpool he helped to form part of the famous \"Team of the Macs\", playing left-back in the first side to ever represent the Anfield club in a Lancashire League fixture, an 8\u20130 victory over Higher Walton on 3 September 1892, they went on to win the title and were duly elected to the Football League Second Division in 1893."]}, {"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Andrew Hannah||||FB||1889\u20131891||44||0||Club captain 1889\u20131891"]}]}}
