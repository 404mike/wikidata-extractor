It features a line-up of Trevor Horn, Anne Dudley, Paul Morley and Lol Creme, along with other appearances from John Hurt, soprano Sally Bradshaw, Rakim, and Donna Lewis. As it had been 10 years since their last album, this album carries a completely different sound to that which had defined their four previous albums. The group blended the music of French impressionist composer Claude Debussy with drum and bass, opera, hip hop, jazz, and narration, to create a concept album which they described as \"the soundtrack to a film that wasn't made about the life of Claude Debussy.\"", "* Sally Bradshaw \u2013 Vocals (tracks: 1 to 5, 8 to 13)"]}, {"page": "Fuck the Millennium", "response": ["The live performance was directed by Ken Campbell \u2013 who Drummond had first met in 1976 when he was recruited as the set designer for Campbell's stage production of The Illuminatus! Trilogy \u2013 and introduced by the music industry figure and pundit Tony Wilson. Drummond's creative associates Mark Manning and Gimpo appeared on stage as, respectively, \"an axe-wielding \"salvationist\" in a vicar's collar and gold lame suit, and a shop steward character in a white coat with a megaphone\". Drummond and Cauty were then unveiled as pyjama-clad, wheelchair-bound pensioners with grey hair and, strapped to their foreheads, prominent horns that had been used regularly in the KLF's promotional videos. The duo wheeled around the stage in their wheelchairs, and at one point Drummond was seen plucking feathers from a dead swan. They were supported by Acid Brass playing \"What Time Is Love?\"; a male choir's rendition of \"K Cera Cera\", joined by opera singer Sally Bradshaw; the Viking Society in costume as lifeboatmen; and the politically topical Liverpool Dockers chanting \"Fuck the Millennium\". A press release issued by Mute/Blast First (Acid Brass' and 2K's record label) suggested that \"Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of Dettol, caused havoc in their motorised wheelchairs. These old reprobates, bearing a grandfatherly resemblance to messrs Cauty and Drummond, claimed to have just been asked along.\" Following the performance, every audience member received a \"Fuck the Millennium\" T-shirt, poster, and bumper sticker in a carrier bag."]}, {"page": "Tenement Symphony (Marc Almond album)", "response": ["*Sally Bradshaw \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "1998 MTV Europe Music Awards", "response": ["*Faithless (featuring Sally Bradshaw) \u2014 \"God is a DJ\""]}, {"page": "Bradshaw (surname)", "response": ["*Sally Bradshaw, English singer"]}]}}
