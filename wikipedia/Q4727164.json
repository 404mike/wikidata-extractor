Privately educated, she worked for the BBC as a script editor. She wrote the script for the television series Mistress of Hardwick (about Bess of Hardwick), which won her a Writers' Guild Award for the best educational television series, and several television plays, including Sweet England's Pride, and The Case of Eliza Armstrong.She later recalled: \"A secretary writing scripts was a little like a performing monkey at the BBC - there was a sort of 'Fancy, what a clever little girl' attitude.\"In 1970 she decided to leave the BBC to go freelance. Her first book, The Young Elizabeth(1972), was followed by Danger to Elizabeth (1973), Marriage With My Kingdom (1977), about Elizabeth's courtships, and Elizabeth Regina (1980), which presented the Queen at the height of her powers. Collectively these books became known as Alison Plowden's \"Elizabethan Quartet\". While working on this series she also published Tudor Women (1979).  After the quartet she wrote Elizabethan England: Life in an Age of Adventure (1982). In addition she wrote many drama and other scripts for BBC radio between 1963 and 1988.\nLater she turned her attention to the 19th century with The Young Victoria (1983) and Caroline and Charlotte (1989), then the Civil War period with The Stuart Princesses (1996), about the six princesses of the House of Stuart who lived through the violent upheavals of the 17th century.  This was followed by Women All on Fire (1998), about the activities of women on both sides of the Civil War. One of these women was Queen Henrietta Maria, of whom she published a biography in 2001.  She continued with In a Free Republic: Life in Cromwell's England (2006) and the last of her 25 books, The Winter Queen (about Elizabeth Stuart, wife of Frederick V, Elector Palatine who accepted the crown of Bohemia), published posthumously in 2008.\nPlowden was devoted to animal welfare, and shared her home with two cats.

In August 1797, Caroline left Carlton House, establishing herself in a rented home near Blackheath and leaving her daughter behind\u2014English law at the time considered the father's rights to minor children paramount. However, the Prince took no action to further restrict Caroline's access to her daughter.  In December 1798, the Prince invited his estranged wife to spend the winter at Carlton House, which she refused to do. It was the last serious effort at reconciliation, and its failure meant there was little likelihood that George would have a legitimate son who would come between Charlotte and the British throne.  Caroline visited her daughter at Carlton House, and sometimes Charlotte was driven out to Blackheath to visit her mother, but was never allowed to stay in her mother's house.  During the summers, the Prince leased Shrewsbury Lodge at Blackheath for his daughter, which made visiting easier, and according to Alison Plowden, who wrote of George's relationship with his wife and daughter, Caroline probably saw as much of her daughter as she wanted to."]}, {"page": "Lady Jane Seymour", "response": ["Lady Jane Seymour (c.1541 \u2013 19 March 1561)Alison Plowden, Lady Jane Grey (History Press, 2004), p 173 was an influential writer during the sixteenth century in England, along with her sisters, Lady Margaret Seymour and Anne Seymour, Countess of Warwick.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Seymour, Lady Jane (1541\u20131561), writer, by Jane Stevenson  Their brothers were Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford and Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley.  They were the children of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, who from 1547 was the Lord Protector of England after the death of King Henry VIII and during the minority of Jane's first cousin, King Edward VI. She was baptised 22 February 1541, her godmothers were Lady Mary (the King's daughter, at the time declared illegitimate but later to become queen) and Katherine Howard, the fifth wife of Henry VIII, and queen at the time. Some sources say that Thomas Cromwell was her godfather, but this cannot be correct as he had been executed the year before.  Jane was thus the niece of Henry VIII's third wife, Queen Jane, whom she was probably named after. She was the sole witness to the secret marriage of her brother Edward to Lady Katherine Grey (a potential heir to Queen Elizabeth I) in 1560. She died a year later, aged 20, probably of tuberculosis."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Poston", "response": ["* Sweet England's Pride (Alison Plowden): Radio 4, 14 November 1971"]}, {"page": "2007 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Alison Plowden, historian (born 1931)"]}, {"page": "1931 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 18 December \u2013 Alison Plowden, historian (born in India; died 2007)"]}, {"page": "Plowden", "response": ["* Alison Plowden (1931\u20132007), English historian and biographer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2007", "response": ["*Alison Plowden, 75, British historian."]}, {"page": "Alison Margaret Chichele Plowden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alison Plowden"]}, {"page": "Henrietta Maria", "response": ["At first, there was uncertainty about the new Queen's name, and one historian has said of this \"\u2026 Henriette or Henrietta seeming altogether too fanciful for English taste\".
