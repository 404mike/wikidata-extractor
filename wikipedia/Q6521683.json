When United signed Len Birks in October 1924 it looked like Milton's tenure was drawing to a close but he regained his place in the side and played in the Blades' winning 1925 FA Cup Final team. The following season was more difficult however, and a mixture of a long-standing ankle injury, his lack of pace and the introduction of the new offside rule meant that he only played twelve more times and was finally released in May 1927."]}]}}
