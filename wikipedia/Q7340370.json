At the peak of his career he raced six seasons in the MotoGP, then named 500cc Grand Prix Championship. He also competed for five years in the World Superbike Championship and became British Superbike Champion in 1990. McElnea went on to run the very successful Rob Mac Racing team in the British Superbike Championship for over a decade until 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isle of Man TT", "response": ["| Ray Amm, Adrian Archibald, Graeme Crosby, Harold Daniell, Max Deubel, Ralf Engelhardt, Ryan Farquhar, Patrick Farrance, Carl Fogarty, Alex George, Tom Herron, Darren Hope, Emil H\u00f6rner, Alan Jackson, Tony Jefferies, Geoff Johnson, Klaus Klaffenb\u00f6ck, Rob McElnea, Bob McIntyre, Phil Mellor, Dave Morris, Clive Pollington, Walter Schneider, Ian Simpson, Rolf Steinhausen, Hans Strauss, Luigi Taveri, Don Williams, Barry Woodland Dean Harrison"]}, {"page": "Scunthorpe", "response": ["* Rob McElnea, 500cc grand prix rider, team manager of the Virgin Mobile Yamaha team"]}, {"page": "Suzuki", "response": ["* During the 1970s and 1980s, Heron International sponsored the Suzuki factory racing team in Grand Prix motorcycle racing, with riders including Barry Sheene, Randy Mamola, Mick Grant and Rob McElnea.

On short circuits, his first championship success came when he won the 250cc British Championship in 1990. Superbike victory followed with the British Superbike Championship in 1995. Some attributed his success to James Whitham leaving the series mid-season to deal with cancer [Whitham was behind in the championship prior to his illness]. Although he did not take a BSB victory in 1996 or 1997, Hislop was hired by Rob McElnea's dominant Cadbury's Boost Yamaha team for 1998 [to the surprise of commentators and journalists, most notably BBC pundit Barry Nutley]. The nature of the fight for the championship between Hislop & team mate Mackenzie was illustrated by a near-collision on the last lap at Snetterton which cost the team a 1\u20132 finish. Hislop generally matched his countryman before an injurious crash took him out of title contention."]}, {"page": "Andrew Pitt", "response": ["Pitt again changed direction following the demise of Reitwagen, joining Rob McElnea's team midway through the 2010 British Superbike Championship season as a replacement for Neil Hodgson, but he was injured in a crash at Brands Hatch and missed the rest of the season."]}, {"page": "Neil Hodgson", "response": ["At the start of the 2010 season Hodgson returned to the British Superbike Championship with the Motorpoint Yamaha team managed by Rob McElnea.
