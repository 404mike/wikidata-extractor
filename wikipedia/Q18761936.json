Furthermore, he was the technical advisor to the London Royal Opera House from 1898 until his death in 1919.

It was an important project for him: it was the first to be designed using unobstructed sightlines to the stage and was notable for its holding capacity, and prompt construction, something for which he latterly became known in architectural circles. The Grand was revolutionary in its design; it was used as an educational showpiece to amateur architects and it was often visited and commented on by architectural critics and journalists.Walker, p. 6. In one of the three volumes, entitled Modern Opera Houses and Theatres, which were published between 1896 and 1898, the author Edwin Sachs made reference to the Grand's \"good sighting and acoustics of the auditorium, economy of space and cost, and rapidity of execution\".Walker, pp. 6\u20137. Matcham's improvement of sightlines were a result of his use of cantilevered steel. This new design allowed for the balconies to protrude into the auditorium without the use of the supporting pillars which increased seating capacity and gave the audience better views of the stage. It was a design that Matcham patented and incorporated into all his future theatrical designs.Walker, p. 10."]}, {"page": "Concrete and Constructional Engineering", "response": ["The magazine was founded in 1906 by architect and founder of the Concrete Institute (later The Institution of Structural Engineers), Edwin Sachs.Our history.
