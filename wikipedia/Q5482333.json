In his next game against Oxford University he hit what proved to be his highest score, 20 not out (the second top score in the innings) as Worcestershire were dismissed for 121 (they went on to lose by three wickets). Poor displays against Gloucestershire and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) followed, and that was that as far as his first-class career was concerned.\nRomney died in Malvern, Worcestershire, at the age of 89.", "link_mentions": {}}}
