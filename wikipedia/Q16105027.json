The laundering - the far more serious charge - alleged was that he and two others had administered a trust fund in excess of $100 million, which was acquired by others and independently of Baines as a result of a share push scam or a pump and dump fraud known as the AremisSoft fraud. The prosecution alleged that once the funds came to be managed by or through him, he knew of the provenance of the fund and administered it with that knowledge (the level of knowledge required for criminal liability is suspicion, though that suspicion has to be proven beyond reasonable doubt). He did not benefit directly from the fund itself but did receive payment by the fund for his administration of it. One of the two individuals, Roys Poyiadjis,  responsible for the original scam was subsequently sentenced to a non-custodial term. The other remains at large.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from the Isle of Man", "response": ["*Trevor Baines (born 1939), businessman, jailed in 2009, for money laundering."]}, {"page": "Isle of Man Prison", "response": ["* Trevor Baines"]}]}}
