He is currently the assistant manager at EFL Championship club Peterborough United.\nBorn in Truro, Cornwall, Etherington began his footballing career at Peterborough United and was a stand-out performer for the Posh, which attracted the attention of Premier League clubs. He joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2000, along with Simon Davies. He struggled at Tottenham and left for West Ham United in 2003. At the East London club, Etherington showed his true form and became a vital player for the Hammers. However, he had personal problems related to an addiction to gambling and in 2009 was sold by manager Gianfranco Zola to fellow Premier League side Stoke City.\nAt Stoke, Etherington became a vital member of the side under manager Tony Pulis, winning the player of the year award for the 2009\u201310 season and also played in the 2011 FA Cup Final. Etherington remained a regular under Pulis in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 before he was released by Mark Hughes at the end of the 2013\u201314 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Truro", "response": ["140px|thumb|Matthew Etherington, 2015", "*Matthew Etherington (born 1981), former professional footballer with 426 club caps, he played for West Ham and Stoke City."]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["Former Crystal Palace player and manager of Reading Alan Pardew was lined up to be the next bench boss.
