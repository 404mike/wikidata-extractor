The control exercised over the implementation of the labourers' acts by conservative elements in rural society had had a ruinous affect. This finally brought the labourers' bodies together to gain political muscle. It became the raison d'\u00eatre for calling a labour convention at Limerick Junction, County Tipperary on 15 August 1894,Lane, P\u00e1draig G.: p.91Lane, Fintan: pp.189-192 at which the Irish Land and Labour Association was created and officially launched, its founders D.

Sheehan, D.D.: p.67  ", "The Irish Parliamentary Party, after had it alienated O'Brien from the party in 1903, tried by every means to curtail his activities after he became associated with Sheehan's ILLA, regarding their conciliatory approach in the land question as a dangerous deviation from party policy. In the manner in which the Party took control of O'Brien's UIL through the involvement of Joseph Devlin, Redmond and Dillon were determined to undermine O'Brien and \"squelch that body by getting a few reliable Munster MPs to start a new Land and Labour group and claim it as the legitimate continuation of the original association\".O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.170 In 1905, Dillon's loyal \"Redmonite\" ally and ILLA secretary J. J. O'Shee was tasked with forming a break-away 'party-subservient' organisation in answer to Sheehan's domination of the original one. Sheehan had however created that domination on order to realize the great democratic principle of the government of the people by the people and for the people in the teeth of party autocracy.Lane, P\u00e1draig G.: pp.94\u201395 A larger section, mainly in counties Cork, Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary, followed Sheehan who renamed it the 'Land and Labour Association' (LLA). Its members sat on most Rural and District County Councils.
