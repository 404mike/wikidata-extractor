Five of the 15 highest grossing films at the US box office in 2009 and seven of the 15 highest grossing films in 2008 were scored by Zimmer or someone who used to work for him. Such is their utter dominance of the \"blockbuster sound\" that producers and directors wanting a piece of the box office pie return time after time to the studio, not for new or innovative music, but for another variation on the last hit movie's score, one which won't upset the film's target demographic, and creativity be damned.\" Remote Control Productions and Zimmer have been accused of having a monopoly in film music, where filmmakers hire members of Remote Control to create music that sounds similar to Zimmer's style instead of hiring independent composers for their own styles."]}, {"page": "FIFA Anthem", "response": ["In 2018, FIFA commissioned Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe to compose a new theme to be used at 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.
