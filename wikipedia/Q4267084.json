According to British lichenologist Annie Lorrain Smith, reindeer carcasses were stuffed with lichen and powdered glass, and suggests that the sharp edges of the glass would make the animals' internal organs more susceptible to the effects of the lichen poison. However, it is known that the lichen itself is also effective\u2014powdered lichen added to fat and inserted into reindeer carcasses will also be fatal to wolves that consume it.
