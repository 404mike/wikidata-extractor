Another variation was the Camelback locomotive, with the cab situated halfway along the boiler. In England, Oliver Bulleid developed the SR Leader class locomotive during the nationalisation process in the late 1940s. The locomotive was heavily tested but several design faults (such as coal firing and sleeve valves) meant that this locomotive and the other part-built locomotives were scrapped.

There were two Chief Mechanical Engineers; Richard Maunsell between 1923 and 1937 and Oliver Bulleid from 1937 to 1948, both of whom designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace much of that which was inherited in 1923.

It was not until the arrival of Oliver Bulleid as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway, in 1937, that the problem was finally addressed when he teamed up with Alfred Raworth, the Chief Electrical Engineer, to solve the issue. To overcome the problem of gaps in the third rail three experimental locomotives were built (which later became the British Rail Class 70) which were fitted with large flywheels that maintained momentum long enough to avoid stalling in gaps. The second problem for freight train operation by electric locomotives was the serious hazard that would result if the 750 V DC third rail was laid in goods yards, as this would not only be a danger to personnel on the ground but also present some complex issues loading and unloading many types of freight wagons. The initial solution was to install simple tramway-type overhead wires to carry the 750 V supply in certain yards and add a pantograph on the locomotive roofs."]}, {"page": "Henry Ivatt", "response": ["He had six children, the first of whom, Campbell, died as a child in 1898.

The soft exhaust of the Lema\u00eetre multiple-jet blastpipe precipitated an adjustment to the smoke deflectors on three converted locomotives, with the tops angled to the vertical in an attempt to improve air-flow along the boiler cladding. This failed to achieve the desired effect, and the final two modified locomotives retained the Maunsell-style deflectors.", "Maunsell's replacement Oliver Bulleid believed that there was little need to improve draughting on this series.

The \"stovepipes\" were reduced to two,  producing a fierce exhaust blast that dislodged soot inside tunnels and under bridges. The experiment was discontinued in February 1941 and the locomotive re-fitted with a Maunsell King Arthur chimney. The last experiment was with spark-arresting equipment in response to lineside fires caused by poor quality coal.Bradley (1987), p. 124 Nos.\u00a0784 Sir Nerovens and 788 Sir Urre of the Mount were fitted with new wide-diameter chimneys in late 1947.
