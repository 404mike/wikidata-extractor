Loefah started off collaborating with the Digital Mystikz on the DMZ nights run in Brixton and was part of Mary Anne Hobbs' Dubstep Warz radio show that contributed to breaking the genre to the mainstream. He was known for having a dark and minimal style that used powerful basslines and menacing vocal samples in order to create a sense of dread.In around 2007 Loefah began to fall out of love with the genre. In 2009 he founded the record label Swamp 81 which originally released dubstep records by the likes of Kryptic Minds and Skream. However following the release of Addison Groove's \"Footcrab\" the label began to focus on an increasingly wider spectrum of Bass music. His label holds a regular show on Rinse FM.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Exit (festival)", "response": ["|Deadmau5, Underworld, Groove Armada, Kreator, Bad Religion, Carl Craig, Fedde Le Grand, Digitalism, House of Pain, Marco Carola, DJ Sneak, Paul Kalkbrenner, Magnetic Man, Parkway Drive, Anti-Nowhere League, Partibrejkers, Beirut, Go Back to the Zoo, Discharge, Steve Aoki, Tiga, Rebel Rave, James Zabiela, SARS, Hadouken!, Laibach, Joris Voorn, Arkona, Better Lost Than Stupid, De Staat, Darkwood Dub, Gramophonedzie, Nosaj Thing, Atheist Rap, Maya Jane Coles, DJ Muggs, The Hacker, Digital Soundboy, Danny Byrd & MC Dynamite, Photek, Joachim Garraud, Spy ft.

The tempo is nearly always in the range of 132\u2013142 beats per minute, with a clap or snare usually inserted every third beat in a bar. In its early stages, dubstep was often more percussive, with more influences from two\u2011step drum patterns. Many producers were also experimenting with tribal drum samples, such as Loefah's early release \"Truly Dread\" and Mala's \"Anti-War Dub\".", "Forward>> also ran a radio show on east London pirate station Rinse FM, hosted by Kode9. The original Forward>> line ups included Hatcha, Youngsta, Kode\u00a09, Zed Bias, Oris Jay, Slaughter Mob, Jay Da Flex, DJ Slimzee, and others, plus regular guests. The line up of residents has changed over the years to include Youngsta, Hatcha, Geeneus, and Plastician, with Crazy D as MC/host. Producers including D1, Skream and Benga make regular appearances.Another crucial element in the early development of dubstep was the Big Apple Records record shop in Croydon. Key artists such as Hatcha and later Skream worked in the shop (which initially sold early UK Hardcore / Rave, Techno and House and later, garage and drum and bass, but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area), while Digital Mystikz were frequent visitors.  El-B, Zed Bias, Horsepower Productions, Plastician, N\u00a0Type, Walsh and a young Loefah regularly visited the shop as well. The shop and its record label have since closed.", "All throughout 2003, DJ Hatcha pioneered a new direction for dubstep on Rinse FM and through his sets at Forward>>.

It was there that Skream, Benga, N\u00a0Type, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.", "In 2004, Richard James' label, Rephlex, released two compilations that included dubstep tracks \u2013 the (perhaps misnamed) Grime and Grime\u00a02. The first featured Plasticman, Mark One and Slaughter Mob, with Kode\u00a09, Loefah, and Digital Mystikz appearing on the second. These compilations helped to raise awareness of dubstep at a time when the grime sound was drawing more attention, and Digital Mystikz and Loefah's presence on the second release contributed to the success of their DMZ club night. Soon afterwards, the Independent on Sunday commented on \"a whole new sound\", at a time when both genres were becoming popular, stating that \"grime\" and \"dubstep\" were two names for the same style, which was also known as \"sublow\", \"8-bar\", and \"eskibeat\".", "Beginning in mid-2014, dubstep began to decline drastically in mainstream popularity, particularly in the United States, where many formerly successful dubstep artists became popular. Artists such as Skrillex, for instance, moved on to producing tracks for trap and pop artists, while artists such as Mount Kimbie and James Blake shifted their sounds from post-dubstep into more experimental or soulful electronic influenced music. Early influencers and pioneers of dubstep such as Skream and Loefah moved away from the genre, moving on to other genres instead. Loefah stopped playing and producing dubstep and moved on to UK bass, founding his record label Swamp81 in the process. Skream shifted away from dubstep, choosing to instead produce and play house and techno music in his DJ sets and releasing various techno songs on Alan Fitzpatrick's record label We Are The Brave.", "* BBC Collective dubstep documentary filmed at DMZ 1st Birthday, 2005.
