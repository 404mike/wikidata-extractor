Thomas took over the running of her husband Robert's coal mine after his death in 1833. Unusual as it was at the time that a woman ran the business, more unusually she was also illiterate. Business documents held in the Glamorgan Archives show she signed only with an X. Much of Thomas' subsequent success as a businesswoman was embellished by Merthyr historian Charles Wilkins, who wrote one of the few articles on her life. It is now believed that George Insole, a Cardiff agent, was one of the chief architects of her success, though this does not diminish Thomas's position as one of the few women coal owners in industrial Britain. It is recorded that Lucy once attended the Coal Exchange in Cardiff only to be told she could not enter. She sent a male clerk in her employ into the Coal Exchange with a letter informing the establishment that \"My coal is equal to any mans, failure to grant entry will lead to my business lining another's pockets.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Nixon (mining engineer)", "response": ["During his first visit to Wales, Nixon had been impressed by the natural advantages of Welsh coal for use in furnaces. On his return from France he found that it was beginning to be used by the Thames steamers. He perceived that there was a great opening for it on the Loire, where coal was already imported by sea. At the time, however, he was unable to obtain a supply with which to commence a trade. Lucy Thomas of the Graig colliery at Merthyr, who supplied the Thames steamers, was disinclined to extend her operations, and Nixon was compelled to return to the north of England. However, business again taking him to South Wales, he chartered a small vessel, took a cargo of hundreds of tons of coal to Nantes, and distributed it gratuitously among the sugar refineries, which had been using Newcastle coal."]}, {"page": "William Lewis, 1st Baron Merthyr", "response": ["In 1855 Lewis was appointed as an assistant to W. S. Clark, the chief mining engineer of John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute (1847\u20131890). He spent ten years in that post before succeeding Clark in 1864. Lewis was given the occupancy of Mardy House as part of his job, which became his long-term residence in Aberdare. The same year he married Anne Rees, daughter of William Rees, and granddaughter of Lucy Thomas, the legendary \"mother of the Welsh steam-coal trade\". Lewis and Anne had two sons and six daughters."]}, {"page": "1847 in Wales", "response": ["*27 September - Lucy Thomas, colliery owner ('The Mother of the Welsh Steam Coal Trade')"]}, {"page": "Llansamlet", "response": ["*Lucy Thomas, 19th century businesswoman"]}, {"page": "1781 in Wales", "response": ["*11 March (baptised) - Lucy Thomas, colliery owner ('The Mother of the Welsh Steam Coal Trade') (d. 1847)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Lucy Thomas (1781\u20131847), businesswoman"]}, {"page": "Charles Wilkins (writer)", "response": ["Wilkins was a prolific pioneer in his field and later research has demonstrated some errors and imbalances in his writings. For example, Wilkins was the chief architect of Lucy Thomas' fame as \"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\". His 1888 account gives the impression of Thomas as an enterprising woman who actively went after new markets, whereas evidence now suggests that this work was mainly conducted by her agents, particularly George Insole. Later authors have also commented on the \"notorious unreliability\" of some of his work. Nevertheless, Wilkins' labours have \"smooth[ed] the paths of all future writers on these subjects\" and his works have continued to be referenced in later academic studies."]}, {"page": "George Insole", "response": ["A younger son of an English tenant farmer in Worcestershire, Insole made judicious use of significant financial assistance from his wider family to move to Cardiff, Wales, in 1828, to enter into partnership there as a brick, timber and coal merchant (1829\u20131830), and to become an independent coal producer and shipper in 1832. He pioneered the introduction and early success of South Wales steam coal in the London and international markets and his coal contracts underpinned Lucy Thomas's reputation as \"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\".", "The Insole & Biddle partnership was bankrupted in early 1831. Insole was able to recover his financial position within a few months, and was also left a substantial inheritance that year. From his offices in Cardiff at the mouth of the Glamorganshire Canal, he continued as agent for Waun Wyllt coal, and contracts were written to supply London-based coal merchants. These contracts helped establish the reputation of Welsh coal in the London markets, and were the basis on which Lucy Thomas (widow of Robert) became known as \"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\". Although Thomas has been credited with these ventures, much of the success was due to Insole. Retrieved 4 January 2020."]}]}}
