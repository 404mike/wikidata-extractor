Dufferin's support was short-lived and in some of his letters he went so far as to call Hume an \"idiot\", \"arch-impostor\", and \"mischievous busy-body.\" Dufferin's successor Lansdowne refused to have any dialogue with Hume. Other supporters in England included James Caird (who had also clashed with Lytton over the management of famine in India) and John Bright.Wedderburn (1913):54. Hume also founded an Indian Telegraph Union to fund the transfer of news of Indian matters to newspapers in England and Scotland without interference from British Indian officials who controlled  telegrams sent by Reuters.Wedderburn (1913):55. It has been suggested that the idea of the congress was originally conceived in a private meeting of seventeen men after a Theosophical Convention held at Madras in December 1884 but no evidence exists. Hume took the initiative, and it was in March 1885, when a notice was first issued to convene the first Indian National Union to meet at Poona the following December."]}, {"page": "James Caird", "response": ["James Caird may refer to:", "* Sir James Caird (politician) (1816\u20131892), Scottish writer and politician", "* Sir James Caird, 1st Baronet, of Belmont Castle (1837\u20131916), Scottish jute baron and philanthropist who sponsored Ernest Shackleton's Endurance Expedition", "* Sir James Caird, 1st Baronet, of Glenfarquhar (1864\u20131954), Scottish shipowner, founder of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich", "* James Caird (boat), a whaleboat named after the jute baron, used by Sir Ernest Shackleton"]}, {"page": "Stirling Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|  James Caird"]}, {"page": "Mona Caird", "response": ["In December 1877, she married James Alexander Henryson-Caird, son of Sir James Caird.

The 1881 census showed a decline of 92,250 agricultural labourers since 1871, with an increase of 53,496 urban labourers. Many of these had previously been farm workers who migrated to the cities to find employment.Ensor, p. 117. Between 1871 and 1901 the population of England and Wales increased by 43% but the proportion of male agricultural labourers decreased by over one-third.Ensor, pp. 285-286. According to Sir James Caird in his evidence to the Royal Commission on the Depression in Trade and Industry in 1886, the annual income of landlords, tenants and labourers had fallen by \u00a342,800,000 since 1876.Ernle, p. 381.
