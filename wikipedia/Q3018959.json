John began his rugby career as a schoolboy playing for his local team Cefneithin RFC before switching to first-class west Wales team Llanelli RFC in 1964. It was while at Llanelli that John was first selected for the Wales national team, a shock selection as a replacement for David Watkins to face a touring Australian team.", "John gained more attention the following season. A win over Swansea, where he scored two dropped goals, was described by the Llanelli Star as being down to the \"genius of one player, Barry John\".Hughes (1986) p. 197 He almost missed the second away encounter of the season with Swansea when he was 'held to ransom' by his fellow students at Trinity College. He was only released when Llanelli's club chairman, Elvet Jones, promised to make a donation to the college \"Rag\". Llanelli won all four fixtures against Swansea that season, John scoring in all of them. As well as his two dropped goals in the first away fixture, he scored another in the second away game and a try in both the home matches at Stradey Park. In the 1965/66 season John was chosen to play in trial matches for the Wales national team. Although he was not picked, he was chosen as reserve to regular fly-half David Watkins.Thomas (1979) p. 162", "During the 1966/67 season John was again chosen to trial for Wales. One of the trials forced him to miss the second Swansea encounter of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; his place in the Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett.Hughes (1986) p. 199 Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John.Thomas (1979) p. 182 In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking David Watkins place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team.Thomas (1979) p. 154 This was seen as a surprise move by the Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11\u20134, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the 'Wallabies', due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes.Sports historian Wayne Thomas in his 1979 book A Century of Welsh Rugby Players (p. 162) places criticism for this loss on the midfield players. Stating \"John himself escaped the worst criticism even though guilty of poor positioning to take Allan Lewis's long pass\". Conversely, John's play during this game is praised by other sources. David Watkins in his 1979 autobiography \"The David Watkins Story\" (p. 101) wrote: \"He [John] played very well and I knew he would retain his place against Scotland,\". John himself, in his 1974 autobiography (p. 69-70), wrote that he \"...hadn't played a blinder... but I hadn't made a lot of mistakes\", and follows this up with an extract from Cliff Morgan's after-match report which stated: \"Barry John had a grand first international and looked as if he could beat the defence at any time.\" Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11\u20130 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, and then added to his tally with a dropped goal."]}, {"page": "1977 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["|colspan=\"4\"| David Watkins"]}, {"page": "Wales national rugby union team", "response": ["* 2000 \u2013 David Watkins"]}, {"page": "David Watkins", "response": ["David Watkins may refer to:", "*David Watkins (Australian politician) (1865\u20131935), Member of the Australian House of Representatives 1901\u20131935", "*David Watkins (rugby) (born 1942), Welsh dual-code rugby international, career 1967\u20131983", "*David Watkins (British politician) (1925\u20132013), British Labour Politician, MP for Consett until 1983", "*David Watkins (designer) (graduated 1963), British designer", "*David Watkins (cricketer) (born 1928), former English cricketer", "*David Watkins (Kentucky politician) (born 1943)", "*David Watkins, a figure in the White House travel office controversy under U.S. President Bill Clinton"]}, {"page": "Great Britain national rugby league team", "response": ["There was a reappearance for the Great Britain team at the 1977 World Cup in Australasia under coach David Watkins.
