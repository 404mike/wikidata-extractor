A striker, he played his club football for Manchester United, Swansea Town and Newport County and was part of the Wales squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Quebec", "response": ["*Colin Webster, industrialist, philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["In 1955, the club was rocked by the sudden death of manager McCandless, days after the players had returned to pre-season training. The Swansea board decided against appointing a permanent replacement, instead establishing a three-man selection committee consisting of Ron Burgess, Allchurch and Joe Sykes, with Burgess being given the title of \"team manager\". Under the guidance of the trio, the Swans were able to mount a serious promotion challenge, going unbeaten in eleven games between September and December 1955. However, following a serious injury to defender Tom Kiley, the committee fell out with the Swansea board over their refusal to provide funds to secure a replacement for Kiley, Burgess having transfers for Bob McKinlay and Jim Dugdale rejected by the board. The loss of Kiley and the conflict with the board saw Swansea lose 7 of their last 8 matches of the season, eventually finishing in 10th position. His growing frustration at the club's refusal to invest in the squad and a strained relationship with new manager Trevor Morris led Allchurch to announce his decision to leave the club, stating in his own newspaper column \"I am ready to admit that I had high hopes that my own club would get promotion a couple of years ago [...] then I would have been happy to end my career in the town [...] But that dream does not look like coming true\". Morris later used the money from Allchurch's transfer to sign Colin Webster and Reg Davies."]}, {"page": "Busby Babes", "response": ["Other notable \"Busby Babes\" include full-back Bill Foulkes, wingers Kenny Morgans and Albert Scanlon, forward Dennis Viollet, wing-half Wilf McGuinness (who later became manager of Manchester United) and forwards John Doherty, Colin Webster and Eddie Lewis.

Kenny Morgans had moved to Swansea City in 1961, having rarely played for United after the end of the 1957\u201358 season. Albert Scanlon was sold to Newcastle United in November 1960. Ray Wood had been sold to Huddersfield Town within a year of the Munich crash, having been unable to win back his place in the team from Harry Gregg, leaving Old Trafford around the same time as Colin Webster, who was sold to Swansea Town. Wilf McGuinness suffered a broken leg in a reserve match during the 1959\u201360 season and never returned to the first team, although he stayed with the club as a member of the coaching staff and spent 18 months as United's manager after the retirement of Sir Matt Busby in May 1969. Injury also ended the career of John Doherty, who played his last game for Leicester City less than a year after United sold him to the East Midlands club."]}, {"page": "2001 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 1 March \u2013 Colin Webster, footballer (born 1932)"]}, {"page": "1958 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|OL ||11|| Colin Webster"]}, {"page": "1958 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 4", "response": ["| FW ||align=\"left\"| Colin Webster || July 17, 1932 || 1 || 0 || 90 || 0 || 0 ||bgcolor=red| 90 || - || - || - || - || - ||align=\"left\"|  Manchester United"]}, {"page": "Noel McFarlane", "response": ["Despite being a mainstay in the youth team, McFarlane was unable to displace Johnny Berry in the senior side and did not make his first-team debut until February 1954, playing on the right wing in a 2\u20130 home win over Tottenham Hotspur.
