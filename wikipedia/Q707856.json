This was a political marriage, arranged in order to reconcile Octavian to Claudia's stepfather, Marcus Antonius, as the two men and their followers contended with several other factions for the control of the Roman state.Roman women of the aristocracy were usually married at the age of 15 or 16, but particularly high-ranking and so desirable brides might become engaged as early as 12; see Ronald Syme, \"Marriage Ages for Roman Senators,\" Historia 26 (1987) 318\u2013332. However, in 41 BC, Claudia's mother, Fulvia, joined her brother-in-law, the consul Lucius Antonius, in raising eight legions against Octavian, in what became known as the Perusine War. The resulting enmity between the triumvirs gave Octavian an excuse to divorce Claudia in 40 BC.Suetonius, \"Divus Augustus\", 62: \"As a youth he had had a daughter of Publius Servilius Isauricus for his betrothed, but reconciling with Antonius after their initial discord, when the troops of both men were insisting that they should additionally be joined by some form of close relationship, he took as his wife Antonius' step-daughter Claudia, Fulvia's child by Publius Clodius, although she was barely yet of marrying age; and after his clash arose with Fulvia the mother-in-law, he divorced her still intact and virgin.\" She was still living in 36 BC, but her subsequent fate is unknown."]}, {"page": "Publius Quinctilius Varus", "response": ["Although he was a patrician by birth, his family, the Quinctilii Vari, had long been impoverished and was unimportant; Ronald Syme notes, \"The sole and last consul of that family\", Sextus Quinctilius, \"had been two years antecedent to the Decemvirs\" (i.e. 453 BC).Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 313 His father, Sextus Quinctilius Varus, was a senator who had served as a quaestor in 49 BC. This Sextus aligned with the Senatorial Party in the civil war against Julius Caesar.Caesar Commentarii de Bello Civili 1.23, 2.28.1 Although Sextus survived the defeat, it is unknown whether he was involved in the assassination of Gaius Julius Caesar. Sextus committed suicide after the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC.Velleius Paterculus, 2.71.2. The mother of Varus is unknown; Syme notes that \"no relatives on either side of the family can be discovered or surmised.\"", "Varus married Vipsania, daughter of Agrippa, at an unknown date before 13 BC.Abdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg, p.65; Severy, Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Roman Empire, pp. 64-5 follow Sir Ronald Syme that Varus married three times and his first wife is unknown. Likewise, the mother of Vipsania is also uncertain. Some think her Claudia Marcella Major, e.g. Severy, Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Roman Empire, p.p.64-5. Others think Agrippa's first wife, Caecilia Attica, Reinhold, Marcus Agrippa (1933); Gaius Stern, Women, Children, and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae (Berk. diss. 2006). If the former (pace Syme, Severy, Abdale), she was both daughter of Agrippa and a great-niece to Augustus. Varus became a personal friend to Marcus Agrippa and Tiberius. The historian Josephus says (in a section of his Antiquities whose manuscript tradition Walther John believed to be corrupt)John, Walther. \"Zu den Familienh\u00e4ltnissen des P. Quinctilius Varus\", Hermes 86.2 (1958), pp. 251\u2013255. that the son of Varus, also named \"Publius Quinctilius Varus\", served under him during his command in Syria.Joseph. AJ 17.288.  If true, that son would have to be a son by a prior marriage and not the son by his last wife, Claudia Pulchra.See a full account of the debate in  It is possible that this son might have instead been an older son, Sextus Nonius Quinctilianus, who might have ended up adopted by his sister's husband after Varus and Vipsania died. That would explain why a son of Lucius Nonius Asprenas was named Quinctilianus, which implied adoption.Levick, p. 36", "In 8\u20137 BC, Varus governed the province of Africa.Ronald Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (1986), 320. Later he went to govern Syria from 7/6 BC until 4 BC with four legions under his command, where he was known for his harsh rule and high taxes. The Jewish historian Josephus mentions the swift action of Varus against a messianic revolt in Judaea after the death of the Roman client king, Herod the Great, in 4 BC. After occupying Jerusalem, he crucified 2000 Jewish rebels and may have thus been one of the prime objects of popular anti-Roman sentiment in Judaea (Josephus, who made every effort to reconcile the Jewish people to Roman rule, felt it necessary to point out how lenient this judicial massacre had been). Indeed, at precisely this moment the Jews, nearly en masse, began a full-scale boycott of Roman pottery (Red Slip Ware).66 A.D. \u2013 The Last Revolt (DVD). History Channel. Thus, the archaeological record seems to verify mass popular protest against Rome because of Varus' cruelty."]}, {"page": "Furia gens", "response": ["The Furii Camilli were descended from the dictator Marcus Furius Camillus, one of the most famous heroes of the early Republic, credited both with the final defeat of Veii, and with driving the Gauls from Rome following the Gallic sack of Rome in 390 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

A camillus was a youth entrusted with certain religious obligations, a role likely to be filled by the younger son of a prominent magistrate.Chase, p. 112.  The family then vanishes during the last three centuries of the Republic, but reappears under the early Empire.  According to Ronald Syme, their fortune was restored by Augustus, who tried to revive several impoverished patrician families.Syme, Roman Papers, vol.
