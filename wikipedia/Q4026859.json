The church of St Felicitas and St Piala's Church, Phillack near Hayle is dedicated to Saint Felec (as he appears in a 10th-century Vatican codex). Later generations mistook him for the female Saint Felicity (alias Felicitas) of Rome.Saint Felix was said to have had the miraculous gift of being able to communicate with lions, cats, and other feline creatures. There is also a Mount St Phillack in Victoria, Australia not far from Mount St Gwinear.\nFelec could be equated with Felix, a supposed early king of either Cornwall or Lyonesse according to the Prose Tristan (c. 1235) and later Italian Arthurian romances, but this reference is very late. The character is probably mythical, having been confused with the 7th-century saint Felix of Burgundy. Like Lyonesse, Dunwich, the centre of his diocese, was inundated by the flood that led to the destruction of Lyonesse.\nPiala is said to have been the sister of Saint Gwinear.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Meliodas", "response": ["Meliodas,is a figure in Arthurian legend in the 13th-century Prose Tristan and subsequent accounts.

In the 17th century, Phillack was believed to refer to the Irish Saint Felicitas who is said to have founded Phillack church in the 6th century.
