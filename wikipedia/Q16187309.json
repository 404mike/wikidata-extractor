The last issue of December 2008 featured five of his papers.Chaos, Solitons & Fractals 38(5), pp. 1229\u20131534 (December 2008) The controversy was covered extensively in blogs. The publisher announced in January 2009 that El Naschie had retired as editor-in-chief.  the co-Editors-in-Chief of the journal were Maurice Courbage and Paolo Grigolini. In June 2011, El Naschie sued the journal Nature for libel, claiming that his reputation had been damaged by their November 2008 article about his retirement, which included statements that Nature had been unable to verify his claimed affiliations with certain international institutions. The suit came to trial in November 2011 and was dismissed in July 2012, with the judge ruling that the article was \"substantially true\", contained \"honest comment\", and was \"the product of responsible journalism\". The judgement noted that El Naschie, who represented himself in court, had failed to provide any documentary evidence that his papers had been peer-reviewed.\"Nature libel verdict 'a victory for free speech'\",The Guardian 6 July 2012 Judge Victoria Sharp also found \"reasonable and serious grounds\" for suspecting that El Naschie used a range of false names to defend his editorial practice in communications with Nature, and described this behavior as \"curious\" and \"bizarre\"."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["* Hon.
