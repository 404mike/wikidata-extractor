The eldest of the Mitford sisters, she was regarded as one of the \"bright young things\" on the London social scene in the inter-war period. She wrote several novels about upper-class life in England and France, and is considered a sharp and often provocative wit. She also has a reputation as a writer of popular historical biographies.\nMitford enjoyed a privileged childhood as the eldest daughter of the Hon. David Freeman-Mitford, later 2nd Baron Redesdale. Educated privately, she had no training as a writer before publishing her first novel in 1931. This early effort and the three that followed it created little stir. Her two semi-autobiographical post-war novels, The Pursuit of Love (1945) and Love in a Cold Climate (1949), established her reputation.\nMitford's marriage to Peter Rodd (1933) proved unsatisfactory to both, and they divorced in 1957 after a lengthy separation. During the Second World War she formed a liaison with a Free French officer, Gaston Palewski, who was the love of her life. After the war Mitford settled in France and lived there until her death, maintaining contact with her many English friends through letters and regular visits.\nDuring the 1950s Mitford developed the concept of \"U\" (upper) and \"non-U\" language, whereby social origins and standing were identified by words used in everyday speech. She had intended this as a joke, but many took it seriously, and Mitford was considered an authority on manners and breeding.\nHer later years were bittersweet, the success of her biographical studies of Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire and King Louis XIV contrasting with the ultimate failure of her relationship with Palewski. From the late 1960s her health deteriorated, and she endured several years of painful illness before her death in 1973.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 30", "response": ["*1973 \u2013 Nancy Mitford, English journalist and author (b. 1904)"]}, {"page": "November 28", "response": ["*  1904   \u2013 Nancy Mitford, English journalist and author (d. 1973)"]}, {"page": "1973", "response": ["** Nancy Mitford, English novelist (b. 1904)"]}, {"page": "Evelyn Waugh", "response": ["Among Waugh's growing circle of friends were Diana Guinness and Bryan Guinness (dedicatees of Vile Bodies), Lady Diana Cooper and her husband Duff Cooper,Hastings, p. 263 Nancy Mitford who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner's,Hastings, p. 191 and the Lygon sisters. Waugh had known Hugh Patrick Lygon at Oxford; now he was introduced to the girls and their country house, Madresfield Court, which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering.Byrne, p. 155 In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer Aubrey Herbert. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in Portofino, where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.Hastings pp. 284\u201387", "By 1953, Waugh's popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the Zeitgeist, and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available. His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, Officers and Gentlemen, had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.Patey, p. 324 Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.Amory (ed.), p. 415 Peter Fleming in The Spectator likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".", "Restored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished Officers and Gentlemen. In June 1955 the Daily Express journalist and reviewer Nancy Spain, accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for The Spectator,\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in The Spectator, 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370 but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.Amory (ed.), p. 636 Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of Combe Florey.Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386 In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the Express and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.Stannard, pp. 382\u201383", "Waugh had welcomed the accession in 1958 of Pope John XXIIIAmory (ed.), pp. 514\u201315 and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963.\"An Appreciation of Pope John\" first published in the Saturday Evening Post, 27 July 1963, reprinted in Gallagher (ed.), pp. 614\u201318 However, he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, Pope Paul VI, until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by the replacement of the universal Latin Mass with the vernacular.Hastings, pp. 616\u201320. In a Spectator article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as \"sharp-edged reasonableness\".\"More of the same, Please\", first published in The Spectator 23 November 1962, reprinted in Gallagher (ed.), pp. 602\u201309.

Graham Greene, in a letter to The Times shortly after Waugh's death, acknowledged him as \"the greatest novelist of my generation\",Stannard, Vol. II p. 492 while Time magazine's obituarist called him \"the grand old mandarin of modern British prose\" and asserted that his novels \"will continue to survive as long as there are readers who can savor what critic V. S. Pritchett calls 'the beauty of his malice'\u00a0\". Nancy Mitford said of him in a television interview, \"What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything.
