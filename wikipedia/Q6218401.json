Nevertheless, this was a large increase from the 1984 result of 3.9%. In 1988, Cochran was selected as the Nationals' candidate for the state seat of Monaro, previously a marginal Labor seat. Cochran defeated sitting member John Akister and also warded off an attempt by the Liberal Party to win the seat. In parliament he acted as liaison between the parliamentary party and the Young Nationals. He was known for opposing the creation of new national parks and backing the four-wheel drive lobby to access existing ones. He was re-elected in 1991 and 1995, the latter coming even as the Coalition lost government. During his final term, he was Monaro's first opposition member in 65 years. He resigned from parliament on 26 October 1998, shortly before the 1999 election."]}, {"page": "John Edward Akister", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Akister"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1988 New South Wales state election", "response": ["|Monaro || Labor || John Akister || |Peter Cochran* (Nat)Chris Handbury (Lib) || ||"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1984 New South Wales state election", "response": ["|Monaro || Labor || |John Akister || Ronald Formann (Nat)John Munro (Lib) || ||"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1981 New South Wales state election", "response": ["|Monaro || Labor || |John Akister || David Barton (Lib)Susan Mitchell (NCP) || Christopher Kleiss (Ind)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1978 New South Wales state election", "response": ["|Monaro || Labor || |John Akister || John Ballesty (Lib)Thomas Barry (CP) || Graham Edwards (Ind)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1976 New South Wales state election", "response": ["|Monaro || Liberal || |John Akister || Thomas Barry (CP)Valerie Marland (Lib) ||"]}, {"page": "Minister for Transport (New South Wales)", "response": ["| John Akister"]}, {"page": "Electoral results for the district of Monaro", "response": ["| John Akister"]}, {"page": "Akister", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Akister"]}, {"page": "Wran ministry (1984\u20131986)", "response": ["| John Akister"]}, {"page": "Wran ministry (1986)", "response": ["| John Akister"]}, {"page": "Unsworth ministry", "response": ["| John Akister"]}, {"page": "Akister, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Akister"]}]}}
