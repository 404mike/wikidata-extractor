In his youth he walked the decks of the Titanic before she sailed. He tried to enlist in the British armed forces shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. His request was refused on account of his youth. However, in September 1916, he joined the Royal Engineers Signal Division and was sent to France in January 1918. After the First World War, Halestrap was employed by Marconi and worked with Cyril Evans, who had been the Californian's wireless operator on the night of the Titanic disaster. At this time he was living in Black Notley in Essex with his wife Gladys Gwendoline.\nIn the Second World War, he was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals and, in 1942, was seconded to the Special Operations Executive. He lost his only son during the war. Flying Officer (Navigator) John Philip Halestrap died on 4 March 1945, aged twenty, while serving with the 68 Sqdn. Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was buried at Ipswich Crematorium in Suffolk. After the war, Arthur worked at first as a member of the Allied Control Commission in Germany, then as a member of the Diplomatic Wireless Service. He retired in 1970.\nIn 1963, Halestrap was appointed as a Member of The Order of the British Empire. He was awarded the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1988.\nHe continued to appear on television documentaries into his extremely old age. In 2003, aged 105, he was the only British veteran of the First World War to attend the Armistice Day Ceremony in Ypres, where he rose from his wheelchair and, in a clear and strong voice, recited Laurence Binyon's poem \"For the Fallen\". Along with Harry Patch and a few others, he was featured in the 2003 television series World War 1 in Colour as well as The Last Tommy on BBC 1 in 2005.\nArthur Halestrap died in Kings Sutton, Northamptonshire, where he had moved to in the 1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2004 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Arthur Halestrap, one of the last surviving British soldiers of World War I (born 1898)"]}, {"page": "King's Sutton", "response": ["*Arthur Halestrap, one of the last surviving British soldiers of the First World War, lived and died in the village."]}, {"page": "Black Notley", "response": ["*Arthur Halestrap - one of the last surviving soldiers of World War I."]}, {"page": "World War 1 in Colour", "response": ["*Arthur Halestrap (1898\u20132004)"]}, {"page": "List of L\u00e9gion d'honneur recipients by name (H)", "response": ["| Arthur Halestrap"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2004", "response": ["*Arthur Halestrap, 105, British World War I soldier and centenarian."]}, {"page": "Halestrap", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Halestrap"]}, {"page": "The Last Tommy (TV series)", "response": ["When filming began in 2003, only 27 British veterans of the First World War were known to be still alive, 12 of whom were featured in the series, along with German veteran Charles Kuentz. Those interviewed were: Harry Patch, Claude Choules, Bill Stone, Alfred Anderson, Sandy Young, Alfred Finnigan, Arthur Halestrap, Jim Lovell, Arthur Barraclough, Charles Watson, Percy Wilson and Jonas Hart. Fred Lloyd and John Ross  were also interviewed by Quickfire Media about their wartime experiences, but were not featured in any of the series' episodes.", "In addition to interviews with the veterans, the series also contained footage of Arthur Halestrap's 2003 visit to the Western Front, and Harry Patch's visit the following year, along with his meeting with Charles Kuentz. The reenactments of various veterans' stories, were filmed in East Anglia and Suffolk. Each episode is an hour long, with the first two focusing primarily on the wartime memories of the veterans, whilst the third one covers their post-war life, including their memories of the Second World War."]}]}}
