She collaborated with Ivan Roitt and Peter Campbell to further understand the autoimmune basis of Hashimoto's disease (citations).  Doniach continued her studies at Middlesex Hospital with various collaborators, including Roitt, Sheila Sherlock, Keith Taylor, and Gianfranco Bottazzo, and uncovered an autoimmune basis for numerous diseases, including pernicious anemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, and type I diabetes  This led to the concept of organ-specific auto-immunity."]}, {"page": "Abdel Halim Hafez", "response": ["Doctors who treated him during his illness journey are Dr. Mustafa Kenawy, Dr. Yassin Abdel Ghaffar, Dr. Zaki Sweidan, Dr. Hisham Issa, Dr. Shaker Sorour, and from England Dr. Tanner, Dr. Sheila Sherlock, Dr. Doger Williams, Dr. Ronald Macbeth, and from France Dr. Sarazan."]}, {"page": "Meena Kumari", "response": ["In 1968, Kumari was diagnosed with cirrhosis of liver.
