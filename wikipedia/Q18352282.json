She was partnered variously by Donald MacLeary, Keith Rosson, Desmond Kelly and Rudolf Nureyev. She also made her mark in many ballets of Ashton and Balanchine (famously an adherent of tall ballerinas). She had the benefit of personal coaching from Balanchine himself and from Bronislava Nijinska for the role of the Hostess in one of her best-known ballets, Les Biches. A totally new dimension was added to Bergsma's repertory and reputation in 1970, when the American choreographer Glen Tetley chose her and Desmond Kelly to create the leading roles in his new ballet Field Figures. Two years later Rudolf Nureyev and Bergsma danced together in filmed excerpts of this ballet.

It was his first major work, his first for the Sadler's Wells company, and his first (of an eventual seven) set to a Stravinsky score. With its bright, carnavalesque d\u00e9cor by Nicholas Georgiadis, then still a student at the Slade School, it had its premiere on 18 January 1955 at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. John Lanchbery conducted the orchestra. The cast included Maryon Lane and Donald Britton in the principal roles, supported by David Poole, Sara Neil, Gilbert Vernon, Annette Page, Donald MacLeary, and Bryan Lawrence. Macmillan's choreography for the suite of dances is sharp and spiky, with pointed fingers, angled ports de bras, and sudden changes of direction. \"There is a bustling general dance full of entrances and exits for the company, a pas de trois, a rumbustious solo for a male dancer, an adagio for the ballerina and five cavaliers, and a pas de deux. . . . [It is] fast, fleet, and contemporary, with hints of jive, revue, cinema, and the circus.\"\"Danses concertantes,\" at the Kenneth MacMillan website, http://www.kennethmacmillan.com/ballets/all-works/1953-1960.  Retrieved 14 December 2015. It was an immediate success. Clement Crisp wrote of the first night's performance, \"I still recall how the eye was teased by the sparks of energy and wild originality given off by the movement, how the Georgiadis designs flowed and flashed, how bright-footed the young cast seemed.\"Clement Crisp and Mary Clarke, The Ballet-Goer's Guide (New York: Knopf, 1982). Ninette de Valois, artistic director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, was also favorably impressed, as she quickly took MacMillan's ballet into the repertory of the main company at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.Edward Thorpe, Kenneth MacMillan: The Man and His Ballets (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1985)."]}, {"page": "Song of the Earth (ballet)", "response": ["The ballet was an instant success, widely admired by German audiences and critics alike.
