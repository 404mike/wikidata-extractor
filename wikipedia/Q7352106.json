He is remembered by more recent audiences for his performances as the Archdeacon in the popular BBC sitcom, All Gas and Gaiters.\nShort in stature and of unheroic appearance, Hare made his stage career in character roles. From his early days as an actor he was cast as older men. One of his favourite parts, which he played in the provinces before achieving West End success, was \"Grumpy\", a retired lawyer, in which he toured before the First World War.\nAfter war service in the army, Hare got his big break. He was cast in a long-running farce with Ralph Lynn and Tom Walls. His meek and put-upon character was repeated in various incarnations in the eleven Aldwych farces presented by Walls between 1923 and 1933. He also appeared in film versions of most of the farces. After the Aldwych series came to an end, Hare continued to be cast in similar roles in new plays by Ben Travers and many others.\nOccasionally Hare took a break from farce, appearing in revue with Benny Hill and in a musical with Frankie Howerd. His final major role was on television in the late 1960s, as the Archdeacon of St Ogg's in the BBC comedy series All Gas and Gaiters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Robertson Hare"]}, {"page": "All Gas and Gaiters", "response": ["*Robertson Hare \u2013 Ven Henry Blunt, the archdeacon", "It proved to be the first of a series of comedies starring Derek Nimmo in similar bumbling clerical roles\u2014(Oh, Brother!, Oh, Father! and Hell's Bells)\u2014but is regarded as the best, partly because of a strong supporting cast (particularly the experienced farceur Robertson Hare as the archdeacon) and partly because it included some elements of gentle satire.Sangster and Condon TV Heaven.", "In April 2016 the radio drama based on the story behind the making of the series, All Mouth and Trousers by Mark Burgess, was aired by BBC Radio 4.
