Andrew Mason see Challis's most enduring work as more distinctive than the work of those poets. In  Building, certain poems (\"The Iceman\", \"The Shadowless Man\", \"The Thermostatic Man\", \"The Asbestos-Suited Man in Hell\" and its sequel \"The Inflammable Man\") explore psychological states and the development of personal identity. Others in that first collection  (\"The Black One\", \"The Sirens\" and \"The Oracle\") are an often ironic reworking of myths or archetypes into contemporary situations. The poems are all \"linguistically inventive\" but \"carefully crafted\". Challis's poetry published in the twentieth century is characterised by an \"apparent distance\", almost a \"clinical detachment\", which \"subverts the immediate or expected emotional response\". \"Beneath that, however, there is a deeper identification with psychological conditions that are unique to the individual yet common to humankind\"."]}, {"page": "2012 in poetry", "response": ["* Peter Bland"]}, {"page": "Prime Minister's Awards for Literary Achievement", "response": ["*Poetry: Peter Bland"]}, {"page": "2015 in poetry", "response": ["*Peter Bland"]}, {"page": "Storylines Children's Literature Foundation of New Zealand Notable Books List", "response": ["|Peter Bland", "|Peter Bland"]}, {"page": "Nikki Slade Robinson", "response": ["* Starkey the Gentle Pirate by Peter Bland (Steele Roberts, 2010)"]}, {"page": "Bill Sheat", "response": ["In 1963, Sheat was appointed to the drama panel of the newly formed Queen Elizabeth ll Arts Council, later he became the Chair and remained until 1972.
