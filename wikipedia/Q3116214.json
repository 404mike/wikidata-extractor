The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from The Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position. The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for Premier League with FA the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league."]}, {"page": "May 20", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Greg Dyke, English journalist and academic"]}, {"page": "The Football Association", "response": ["Also in December 2016, five former FA executives - David Bernstein, David Davies, Greg Dyke, Alex Horne and David Triesman - called on Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee to propose legislation to reform the FA, saying it was outdated, held back by \"elderly white men\", and unable to counter the power of the Premier League or \"to reform and modernise in a fast-changing world\".", "|Greg Dyke"]}, {"page": "Yeading", "response": ["* Greg Dyke, former Director-General of the BBC, attended Yeading Primary School"]}, {"page": "Hayes, Hillingdon", "response": ["* Greg Dyke (1947-), former BBC director general and former chairman of the FA, grew up in Hayes."]}, {"page": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts", "response": ["# Greg Dyke (television) (2016\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "University of York", "response": ["* Greg Dyke (2004\u20132015)", "The university is also represented by alumni educated in the liberal arts such as English literature, social sciences, economics, philosophy, medieval history, and music.

The controversy arose after Today broadcast a report by its correspondent Andrew Gilligan. The report alleged that a dossier the British Government had produced to convince the British public of the need to invade Iraq had been \"sexed up\" (deliberately exaggerated), and that the government had known this prior to publishing it. In his live 2-way (interview with presenter John Humphrys), just after 6.07 a.m., Gilligan asserted that the dossier and the Government \"probably knew\" that one of the main claims in the dossier \"was wrong\". Gilligan's anonymous source for the claim was Dr David Kelly, a key adviser on biological weapons who had worked in Iraq \u2013 though it was never established whether Dr Kelly had actually used the words Gilligan attributed to him. In the furore that followed Gilligan's report, David Kelly's name became public and he was forced to appear before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. Shortly afterward he was found dead having presumably committed suicide. In the ensuing public inquiry (the Hutton Inquiry), which reported in January 2004, the BBC was heavily criticised. This led to the resignation of the BBC's chairman, Gavyn Davies, the Director-General, Greg Dyke, and Andrew Gilligan."]}, {"page": "John Reith, 1st Baron Reith", "response": ["Reith's autocratic approach became the stuff of BBC legend.
