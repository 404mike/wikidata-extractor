He graduated as a Bachelor of Music from the University of Cambridge in 1616. He was organist of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1628 until 1644 and Master of the Children at the college from 1637.\nIn the 1630s, like John Hilton, he composed mythological and biblical dialogues, such as Dives and Abraham, Saul and the Witch of Endor, and Orpheus and Pluto.\nHis most well-known work is probably \"How are the mighty fallen\", an anthem for soprano, alto, tenor and bass. It is regularly performed throughout cathedrals and churches, normally in England. The work is in the \"Tudor Anthems\" book, print by music publisher Novello & Co. and edited by Lionel Pike.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Herrick (poet)", "response": ["The first composers to set Herrick to music were near-contemporaries: at least 40 settings of 31 poems appear in manuscript and printed songbooks of 1624\u20131683, by Henry and William Lawes, John Wilson, Robert Ramsey and others.
