The songs in Build a Problem were written by dodie over the course of two years. Of the writing process she said, \"I think I was going through a crisis, actually. I was very unsure of who I was and I was trying to figure it out in music. So I think it\u2019s quite unstable of an album\u2014but it\u2019s definitely honest.\"", "\"Guiltless\" was released as the lead single from Build a Problem on 24 May 2019. Dodie described the song as \"a difficult topic that I could never talk about publicly, so I wrote about it instead. There are those complex relationships in life where there's so much love, but so much anger, disbelief, guilt, expectation and resentment. This is a song exploring that; from a safe, vague-ish distance, I hope.\"", "Upon its release, Build a Problem received a Metacritic rating of 80 out of 100 based on seven reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". David Smyth, writing for the Evening Standard, praised dodie for having a sound that is \"still intimate, her voice small and soft, and so understated that one title is simply a full stop\" while also working in intricate production. Malvika Padin of Gigwise praised the album for \"spanning joy, sadness, anger with stops at every turn of dodie\u2019s life\" and gave credit to Dodie's songwriting for its \"ability to balance precious moments of joy with therapeutic musicality\". Dorks Phoebe De Angelis characterised the album's intimacy as \"like a series of diary entries\". Caleb Campbell of The Line of Best Fit heralded the album, saying that \"Build A Problem indeed finds dodie at her most open and fully realised\" that is appealing to both old and new fans. In a more mixed review for Pitchfork, Ashley Bardhan said that \"Clark often finds herself swallowed by misery and bitter self-effacement in the lyrics\" and \"prioritizing lush vocal harmonies\". Despite their mixed rating for the album, Tara Joshi of The Guardian nevertheless recognised that the album has an \"ambition here beyond mere John Lewis ad-style twee acoustic pop\" and named \"Special Girl\" as a standout track.", "Category:Dodie (singer) albums"]}, {"page": "List of UK top-ten albums in 2021", "response": ["| align=\"left\"|Dodie"]}, {"page": "Dodie Clark", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dodie (singer)"]}, {"page": "Lizzy McAlpine", "response": ["Her musical style has been described as \"folk-focused,\" \"folk-pop,\" and a blend of \"jazz, pop, and R&B.\" Her collaborators include Jacob Collier, Dodie, Tom Rosenthal, Ben Kessler, and Thomas Headon."]}, {"page": "Laufey (singer)", "response": ["Laufey performed in the London Jazz Festival in November 2021.
