During his tenure the post changed from suffragan bishop to area bishop with the institution of area bishops in 1992.After service in the RAF 1945\u20131948, Davies was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge (becoming a Cambridge Master of Arts), and at Lincoln Theological College. He was made a deacon and ordained a priest, and began his career as curate in Halton, Leeds. Following that he served for many years in Southern Africa: his posts including that of Missionary Director for Empangeni and Chaplain at the University of Witwatersrand. While he was chaplain at the University, Davies played a major role in drafting the document A Message to the People of South Africa, a pamphlet published by the South African Council of Churches that challenged the Christians in South Africa to examine the policy of Apartheid. In 1970, action by the South African government terminated his ministry in that country.\nReturning to Britain in 1970 to an administrative post at the Church of England Board of Education, he then served as Vicar and University Chaplain at Keele; he was subsequently appointed Principal of Ascension College, Selly Oak, and finally (before his appointment to the episcopate) Diocesan Missioner of St Asaph. He was consecrated a bishop on 5 February 1987, by Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster Abbey. In 2012, while in his retirement he and his wife Shirley led the parish of St Dogfan, Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant in mid-Wales (where he had previously served as Vicar), while they were without a parish priest.On 11 February 2017, fourteen retired bishops signed an open letter to the then-serving bishops of the Church of England. In an unprecedented move, they expressed their opposition to the House of Bishops' report to General Synod on sexuality, which recommended no change to the Church's canons or practises around sexuality. By 13 February, a serving bishop (Alan Wilson, Bishop of Buckingham) and nine further retired bishops \u2014 including Davies \u2014 had added their signatures; on 15 February, the report was rejected by synod.Davies\u2019 books include: \n\nBeginning now - a Christian exploration of the first three chapters of Genesis - Fortress Press (Philadelphia) (1971)\nGood news in Galatians - Paul's letter to the Galatians in Today's English version - Collins Fontana Books (Glasgow) (1975)\nCreed and Conflict - Lutterworth Pr \u2013 ISBN 978-0-7188-2414-3 (1979)\nThe Faith Abroad - Blackwell (Oxford) (1983)\nThe Crisis of the Cross - the Challenge at the heart of the Christian Story - Canterbury Press (Norwich)  (1997)\nBe Born in us today - The Message of the Incarnation - Canterbury Press (Norwich) (1999)\nGod at Work - Creation Then and Now - Canterbury Press (Norwich) (2000)\nOnly Say the Word - Interactive studies on healing and salvation - Canterbury Press (Norwich) (2002)\nA Song for every morning - Dedication and Defiance with St Patrick's Breastplate - Canterbury Press (Norwich) (2008)Three Mountains to Freedom - Practice Interpretation of Paul's Letter to the Galatians (Deo Publishing Blandford Forum) ( 2015)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Davies", "response": ["John Davies may refer to:", "*John Davies (poet, born 1569) (1569\u20131626), poet, statesman, attorney-general in Ireland", "*John Davies (minister) (1804\u20131884), Welsh Congregational Minister", "*John Davies (Welsh politician) (died 1918), Welsh Liberal-Labour politician and trade unionist", "*John Davies, 1st Baron Darwen (1885\u20131950), British cotton manufacturer and Labour politician", "*John Davies (British businessman) (1916\u20131979), British businessman (director-general of the CBI) and Conservative MP and cabinet minister", "*John Davies (Archdeacon of Wrexham) (1908\u20131991), from 1969 to 1978", "*John Davies (swimmer) (1929\u20132020), United States district judge and Olympic gold medalist for Australia.", "*John Davies (New South Wales politician) (1839\u20131896), Australian politician, NSW MLA (1874\u201387), MLC (1888\u201396)", "*John Davies, New Zealand Paralympic lawn bowler", "*John Davies (cricketer, born 1926) (1926\u20132005), Welsh cricketer", "*John Davies (cricketer, born 1932), former English cricketer", "*John Davies (footballer, born 1856) (died 1929), Wrexham A.F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*John Davies (goalkeeper) (fl. 1889\u20131893), with Burslem Port Vale F.C. and Newton Heath F.C.", "*John Davies (footballer, born 1881) (1881\u2013?), English footballer with Liverpool and Blackpool", "*John Davies (winger) (fl. 1953\u20131961), footballer with Portsmouth, Scunthorpe United and Walsall", "*John Davies (footballer, born 1959), Welsh footballer with Cardiff City and Hull City", "*John Davies (footballer, born 1966), Scottish footballer with Clydebank, St. Johnstone, Airdrieonians, Ayr United and Motherwell", "*John Davies (Australian footballer) (born 1943), Australian rules footballer for Geelong", "*John Davies (ice hockey) (1928\u20132009), Canadian ice hockey player with the Edmonton Mercurys", "*John Davies (rugby, born 1941) (1941\u20131969), rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1960s for Wales (RU), Neath, and Leeds (RL)", "*John Davies (rugby union, born 1971), rugby union footballer of the 1990s and 2000s for Wales, Llanelli, and (Llanelli) Scarlets", "*John Davies (rugby league) (born 1991), current rugby league footballer for Castleford Tigers", "*John Davies (middle-distance runner) (1938\u20132003), New Zealand middle-distance runner ", "*John Davies (steeplechase runner), Welsh steeplechase runner", "*John Davies (swimmer) (1929\u20132020), Olympic gold medalist for Australia and later United States district judge", "*John Davies (bishop of St Asaph) (born 1943), Bishop of St Asaph, 1999\u20132008", "*John Davies (bishop of Shrewsbury) (born 1927), former Anglican Bishop of Shrewsbury", "*John Davies (Archbishop of Wales) (born 1953), Archbishop of Wales (since 2017);
