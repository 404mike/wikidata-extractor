According to later biographer Sonia Purnell \u2013 who was Johnson's Brussels deputy \u2013 he helped make Euroscepticism \"an attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the Right\", whereas it had been associated previously with the British Left. Johnson's articles established him as the favourite journalist of the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, but Johnson annoyed her successor, the Europhile John Major, who spent a great deal of time attempting to refute what Johnson said. Johnson's articles exacerbated tensions between the Conservative Party's Eurosceptic and Europhile factions. As a result, he earned the mistrust of many party members. His writings were also a key influence on the emergence of the EU-opposing UK Independence Party (UKIP) in the early 1990s. Conrad Black, then proprietor of The Daily Telegraph, said Johnson \"was such an effective correspondent for us in Brussels that he greatly influenced British opinion on this country's relations with Europe\".", "Johnson's biographer and friend Andrew Gimson said that while \"in economic and social matters, [Johnson] is a genuine liberal\", he retains a \"Tory element\" to his personality through his \"love of existing institutions, and a recognition of the inevitability of hierarchy\". His liberal stance on matters such as social policy, immigration and free trade were also commented on in 2019. In 2019, Al Jazeera editor James Brownswell said that although Johnson had \"leaned to the right\" since the Brexit campaign, he remained \"slightly more socially liberal\" than much of his party. In 2019, former Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party Michael Heseltine said Johnson \"has no right to call himself a one-nation Conservative\" and wrote: \"I fear that any traces of liberal conservatism that still exist within the prime minister have long since been captured by the rightwing, foreigner-bashing, inward-looking view of the world that has come to characterise his fellow Brexiters.\"", "Purnell described him as \"a manic self-promoter\" who has filled his life with \"fun and jokes\". Described by Crines as \"a joker\", Johnson has said that \"humour is a utensil that you can use to sugar the pill and to get important points across\". Purnell wrote colleagues regularly expressed the view that Johnson used people to advance his own interests, and author Andrew Gimson wrote that Johnson was \"one of the great flatterers of our times\". Purnell commented he deflected serious questions using \"a little humour and a good deal of bravado\". According to Gimson, Johnson was \"a humane man\" who \"could also be staggeringly inconsiderate of others\" when pursuing his own interests. Gimson added Johnson has \"an excessive desire to be liked\".", "Johnson holds ancient Greek statesman and orator Pericles as a personal hero. According to Johnson's biographer, Andrew Gimson, regarding ancient Greek and Roman polytheism: \"it is clear that [Johnson] is inspired by the Romans, and even more by the Greeks, and repelled by the early Christians\". Johnson views secular humanism positively and sees it as owing more to the classical world than to Christian thinking. However, in 2021, Johnson was asked if he held pre-Christian beliefs, which he denied, saying, \"Christianity is a superb ethical system and I would count myself as a kind of very, very bad Christian[.] No disrespect to any other religions, but Christianity makes a lot of sense to me.\""]}, {"page": "When Boris Met Dave", "response": ["*Andrew Gimson (Johnson biographer)"]}, {"page": "Gimson", "response": ["*Andrew Gimson (born 1958), British political journalist and writer"]}, {"page": "Sally Gimson", "response": ["Sally Gimson (n\u00e9e Malcolm-Smith)Boris: The Adventures of Boris Johnson, Andrew Gimson, Simon & Schuster, 2006  is a British Labour Party politician, ex-councillor in the Highgate ward of Camden Council.
