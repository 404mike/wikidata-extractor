He is best known for writing and illustrating the Swallows and Amazons series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. The books remain popular and Swallows and Amazons is the basis for a tourist industry around Windermere and Coniston Water, the two lakes Ransome adapted as his fictional North Country lake.\nHe also wrote about the literary life of London, and about Russia before, during, and after the revolutions of 1917. His connection with the leaders of the Revolution led to him providing information to the Secret Intelligence Service, while he was also suspected of being a Soviet spy by MI5.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kangchenjunga", "response": ["* In the Swallows and Amazons series of books by Arthur Ransome, a high mountain (unnamed in the books) is given the name \"Kanchenjunga\" by the children when they climb it in 1931."]}, {"page": "Oscar Wilde", "response": ["The anonymous narrator is at first sceptical, then believing, finally flirtatious with the reader: he concludes that \"there is really a great deal to be said of the Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare's sonnets.\" By the end fact and fiction have melded together. Arthur Ransome wrote that Wilde \"read something of himself into Shakespeare's sonnets\" and became fascinated with the \"Willie Hughes theory\" despite the lack of biographical evidence for the historical William Hughes' existence. Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question, Wilde tossed the theory amongst the three characters of the story, allowing it to unfold as background to the plot. The story thus is an early masterpiece of Wilde's combining many elements that interested him: conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth. Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch.", "Wilde's friends had advised him against the prosecution at a Saturday Review meeting at the Caf\u00e9 Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that \"they are going to prove sodomy against you\" and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying \"it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends\". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome a day or so before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome pp 151\u2013152 (1976, Jonathan Cape, London) The Life of Arthur Ransome by Hugh Brogan p85 (1984, Jonathan Cape, London) ", "Oscar Wilde, a critical study by Arthur Ransome was published in 1912.

Wilde told Robert Ross that the play's theme was \"That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously, and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality.\" The theme is hinted at in the play's ironic title, and \"earnestness\" is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue, Algernon says in Act II, \"one has to be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in life\", but goes on to reproach Jack for 'being serious about everything'\".Pabl\u00e9 (2005:302) Blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of Dorian Gray and Sir Robert Chiltern (in An Ideal Husband), but in Earnest the protagonists' duplicity (Algernon's \"bunburying\" and Worthing's double life as Jack and Ernest) is undertaken for more innocent purposes \u2013 largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations. While much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues, Earnest is superficially about nothing at all. It \"refuses to play the game\" of other dramatists of the period, for instance Bernard Shaw, who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals."]}, {"page": "Wrecking (shipwreck)", "response": ["Coot Club, the fifth of Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of books, features wreckers on the Norfolk Broads."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire", "response": ["The novelist tradition in Yorkshire continued into the 20th and 21st centuries, with authors such as J.

Similarly, the film version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang uses a story within a story format to tell a purely fantastic fairy tale within a relatively more realistic frame-story. The film version of The Wizard of Oz does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream. Lewis Carroll's celebrated Alice books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known Sylvie and Bruno subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the \"real\" world.  In each episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, the main story was realistic fiction, with live action human characters, while an inner story took place in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, in which most characters were puppets, except Lady Aberlin and occasionally Mr. McFeely, played by Betty Aberlin and David Newell in both realms."]}, {"page": "The Broads", "response": ["* The children's novels Coot Club and The Big Six, both by Arthur Ransome, are set on the Broads"]}, {"page": "Wroxham", "response": ["The 20th-century children's author, Arthur Ransome, visited Wroxham in the 1930s.
