From this informal group of like-minded intellectuals, Williams developed a style of writing and literal ethic opposed to eisteddfodic tradition. Amongst his heroes were writers Aldous Huxley, W H Auden and George Orwell. Although Williams' poetry was not in keeping with the tradition of the National Eisteddfod, he was still embraced by it.

However, a more realistic picture of Gwynedd farming communities between the Wars was presented by John Ellis Williams (1924-2008) in both English and Welsh. His reminiscences appeared in community newspapers, the Countryman magazine, and subsequently in paperback format in English under the titles of Clouds of Time and other Stories (1989) and Rare Welsh Bits (2000). A free spirit in the Welsh publishing circle, Williams was neither an academic nor a politician, but had embraced Existentialism in post-Second World War France and had an active friendship and correspondence with Simone de Beauvoir. The 1940s also saw the creation of a notable writing group in the Rhondda, called the \"Cadwgan Circle\". Writing almost entirely in the Welsh language, the movement, formed by J. Gwyn Griffiths and his wife K\u00e4the Bosse-Griffiths, included the Welsh writers Pennar Davies, Rhydwen Williams, James Kitchener Davies and Gareth Alban Davies."]}, {"page": "2009 in Wales", "response": ["**Gareth Alban Davies, academic, 82"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2009", "response": ["*Gareth Alban Davies, 82, British academic and poet."]}]}}
