It is likely that \"Arise, ye subterranean winds\" in the music (attributed to Purcell) for The Tempest was written for him. After Purcell's death he continued to work with composers Daniel Purcell and Jeremiah Clarke, and took a leading part in Clarke's Ode upon the death of Mr Purcell at Drury Lane.Baldwin and Wilson, June 1970, p. 523.
