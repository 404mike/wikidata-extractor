He made his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1959 scoring 576 runs at an average of 26.18 including a maiden century against the Free Foresters, sharing an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 256 with Abbas Ali Baig which remains a first-class record for the fifth wicket for Oxford. He won a Blue and subsequently played in two more Varsity matches as a middle-order batsman, in the second of which he stood in as wicket-keeper.\nFry played a handful of matches for Hampshire in the 1960 season in one of which he was twice bowled (for 14 and 1) in a match (versus Sussex) by one of his successors as President of the MCC Robin Marlar. He did not appear for the County in their championship-winning season in 1961.\nFry appeared once for Northamptonshire in 1962 and a couple of times for the Free Foresters against his old University later in the 1960s. Fry has had a long association with the Marylebone Cricket Club whose President he became in 2003-04. He was widely praised for choosing Tom Graveney as his successor \u2013 the first time an ex-professional cricketer had held this office. Fry has held many other positions within the MCC, including chairman of the club itself and, most recently, chairman of the MCC Foundation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "C. B.

Beatrice was ten years Fry's senior, and known for her 'fiery, strong-willed, aggressive' personality; she was reckoned to be 'a cruel and domineering woman', and Fry 'lived in fear of her for the duration of their marriage', as 'she made him thoroughly miserable and he tried to stay away from her as much as possible'. His unhappy marriage impacted Fry's mental health; his daughter-in-law observed: 'I should think anyone would have a breakdown married to her\". At Beatrice's death, they had been married for 48 years; Fry 'adjusted to her death with great equanimity and even her children showed all the freedom of the newly liberated'. In 1984, their son Stephen said: 'My mother ruined my father's life'.
