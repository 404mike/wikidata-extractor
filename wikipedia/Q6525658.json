The Eurasian brown bear has been used to personify Russia since the early 19th century. In 1911, the British satirical magazine Punch published a cartoon about the Anglo-Russian Entente by Leonard Raven-Hill in which the British lion watches as the Russian bear sits on the tail of the Persian cat. The Russian Bear has been a common national personification for Russia from the 16th century onward.  Smokey Bear has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message \"Only you can prevent forest fires\". In the United Kingdom, the bear and staff feature on the heraldic arms of the county of Warwickshire. Bears appear in the canting arms of two cities, Bern and Berlin."]}]}}
