After his death, Stuart Hall was described as \"one of the most influential intellectuals of the last sixty years\".", "In 1951 Hall won a Rhodes Scholarship to Merton College at the University of Oxford, where he studied English and obtained a Master of Arts degree, becoming part of the Windrush generation, the first large-scale emigration of West Indians, as that community was then known. He originally intended to do graduate work on the medieval poem Piers Plowman, reading it through the lens of contemporary literary criticism, but was dissuaded by his language professor, J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien, who told him \"in a pained tone that this was not the point of the exercise.\" He began a PhD on Henry James at Oxford but, galvanised particularly by the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary (which saw many thousands of members leave the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and look for alternatives to previous orthodoxies) and the Suez Crisis, abandoned this in 1957 or 1958 to focus on his political work. In 1957, he joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and it was on a CND march that he met his future wife. From 1958 to 1960, Hall worked as a teacher in a London secondary modern school and in adult education, and in 1964 married Catherine Hall, concluding around this time that he was unlikely to return permanently to the Caribbean.", "*In May 2016, Housmans bookshop sold Hall's private library. 3,000 books were donated to Housmans by Hall's widow Catherine Hall."]}, {"page": "Catherine hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Catherine Hall"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Catherine Hall, Professor of Modern British Social and Cultural History"]}, {"page": "George Fife Angas", "response": ["According to Humphrey McQueen and Catherine Hall, the Angas family business supply chain used slaves.

In a chapter in The Whole Woman entitled \"Pantomime Dames\", she wrote: \"Governments that consist of very few women have hurried to recognise as women, men who believe that they are women and have had themselves castrated to prove it, because they see women not as another sex but as a non-sex.\" Her position first attracted controversy in 1997, when she unsuccessfully opposed the offer of a Newnham College fellowship to physicist Rachael Padman, a trans woman, arguing that, because Padman had been \"born male\", she should not be admitted to a women-only college. She reiterated her views several times over the following years, including in 2015 when students at Cardiff University tried unsuccessfully to \"no platform\" her to stop her from speaking on \"Women & Power: The Lessons of the 20th Century\". Greer responded by reaffirming, during an interview with Kirsty Wark for BBC Newsnight, that she did not regard transgender women as women; she argued that the nomination of Caitlyn Jenner for Glamour Woman of the Year had been misogynist. Over 130 academics and others signed a letter to The Observer in 2015 objecting to the use of no-platform policies against Greer and feminists with similar views; signatories included Beatrix Campbell, Mary Beard, Deborah Cameron, Catherine Hall, Liz Kelly, Ruth Lister, and the Southall Black Sisters."]}, {"page": "Historiography of the British Empire", "response": ["In particular they have shown the ways in which British imperialism rested upon ideas about cultural difference and in turn how British colonialism reshaped understandings of race and gender in both the colonies and at home in Britain.

Porter argued in 2004 that most Britons were largely indifferent to empire. Imperialism was handled by elites. In the highly heterogeneous British society, \"imperialism did not have to have impact greatly on British society and culture.\" John M. MacKenzie countered that there is a great deal of scattered evidence to show an important impact.
