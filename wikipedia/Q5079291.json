The son of a doctor, he was educated at Cheltenham College and won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, where he would later forge a career as an academic.  Inglis spent a two-year period with the engineering firm run by John Wolfe-Barry before he returned to King's College as a lecturer.  Working with Professors James Alfred Ewing and Bertram Hopkinson, he made several important studies into the effects of vibration on structures and defects on the strength of plate steel.\nInglis served in the Royal Engineers during the First World War and invented the Inglis Bridge, a reusable steel bridging system \u2013 the precursor to the more famous Bailey bridge of the Second World War. In 1916 he was placed in charge of bridge design and supply at the War Office and, with Giffard Le Quesne Martel, pioneered the use of temporary bridges with tanks.  Inglis retired from military service in 1919 and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.  He returned to Cambridge University after the war as a professor and head of the Engineering Department.  Under his leadership, the department became the largest in the university and one of the best regarded engineering schools in the world.  Inglis retired from the department in 1943.\nInglis was associated with the Institution of Naval Architects, Institution of Civil Engineers, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Institution of Structural Engineers, Institution of Waterworks Engineers and British Waterworks Association; he sat on several of their councils and was elected the Institution of Civil Engineers' president for the 1941\u201342 session. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society.  Inglis sat on the board of inquiry investigating the loss of the airship R101 and was chair of a Ministry of War Transport railway modernisation committee in 1946.  Knighted in 1945, he spent his later years developing his theories on the education of engineers and wrote a textbook on applied mechanics.  He has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time and has a building named in his honour at Cambridge University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Military engineering vehicle", "response": ["A Heavy RE tank was developed shortly after World War I by Major Giffard LeQuesne Martel RE.  This vehicle was a modified Mark V tank. Two support functions for these Engineer Tanks were developed: bridging and mine clearance. The bridging component involved an assault bridge, designed by Major Charles Inglis RE, called the Canal Lock Bridge, which had sufficient length to span a canal lock. Major Martel mated the bridge with the tank and used hydraulic power generated by the tank's engine to maneuver the bridge into place. For mine clearance the tanks were equipped with 2 ton rollers."]}, {"page": "King's College, Cambridge", "response": ["In the sciences and social sciences, King's alumni include the British sociologist Anthony Giddens, the physicist Patrick Blackett, the chemist Frederick Sanger, The psychologist Edgar Anstey, the palaeontologist Richard Fortey, the economist John Craven, the political theorist John Dunn, the engineer Charles Inglis, and the mathematician and eugenicist Karl Pearson.

It was chaired by Sir Charles Inglis. The committee concluded that the cost and time required to carry out the recommendations of the London plan meant that the proposals would not be achievable in a short period of time and could not be carried out until adequate alternative capacity could be provided. Of the four central proposals the one supported by the committee was the North-South Tunnel. The 1946 report recommended a dozen new routes totalling over 100 miles, estimated to cost \u00a3230m and take at least 30 years to build. Among them were 'route 8', from East Croydon to Finsbury Park, in tunnel from Norbury via Streatham, Brixton and the Victoria line route, except Victoria-Hyde Park Corner-Bond St-Euston.Railway Magazine July 1946 p. 248"]}, {"page": "Telford Medal", "response": ["| Charles Inglis"]}, {"page": "James Charles Inglis", "response": ["Sir James Charles Inglis (9 September 1851 \u2013 19 December 1911) was a British civil engineer."]}]}}
