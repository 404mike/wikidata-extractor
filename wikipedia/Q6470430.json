Charles kneels down in front of the tabernacle of the Brideshead chapel and says a prayer, \"an ancient, newly learned form of words\" \u2013 implying recent instruction in the catechism. Waugh speaks of his belief in grace in a letter to Lady Mary Lygon:I believe that everyone in his (or her) life has the moment when he is open to Divine Grace. It's there, of course, for the asking all the time, but human lives are so planned that usually there's a particular time \u2013 sometimes, like Hubert, on his deathbed \u2013 when all resistance is down and grace can come flooding in.Amory, Mark (ed), The Letters of Evelyn Waugh. Ticknor & Fields, 1980. p. 520.", "*Paula Byrne's biography of Evelyn Waugh, titled Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead, was published by HarperPress in the UK in August 2009 and HarperCollins New York in the US in April 2010. An excerpt was published in the Sunday Times 9 August 2009 under the headline \"Sex Scandal Behind 'Brideshead Revisited'\". The book concerns the 7th Earl of Beauchamp, who was the father of Waugh's friend Hugh Lygon. It states that the exiled Lord Marchmain is a version of Lord Beauchamp and Lady Marchmain of Lady Beauchamp, that the dissolute Lord Sebastian Flyte was modelled after Hugh Lygon and Lady Julia Flyte after Lady Mary Lygon. The book, which Byrne describes in the preface as a \"partial life\", identifies other real-life bases for events and characters in Waugh's novel, though Byrne argues carefully against simple one-to-one correspondences, suggesting instead that Waugh combined people, places and events into composite inventions, subtle transmutations of life into fiction. An illustrated extract appeared in the April 2010 issue of Vanity Fair in advance of American publication."]}, {"page": "Alexandra of Yugoslavia", "response": ["After a brief stay of Peter II in Cairo, Egypt, the couple finally married on 20 March 1944.
