Francis de Wolff was selected to play Vasor, while Donald Pickering played Eyesen. Gorrie cast Henley Thomas as Tarron; the two were old friends who had previously worked together. Robin Phillips, who was also friends with Gorrie, was cast as Altos; Gorrie felt that Phillips' handsome looks fit the role of Altos accurately. Similarly, he wanted the character of Sabetha to resemble a princess, and selected former drama student Katharine Schofield. Gorrie was impressed by the sinister voice of Heron Carvic, casting him as the Voice of Morpho, and the role of Kala was given to Fiona Walker, who had written to Gorrie for a role. For the role of the Voord, among other villains, three young actors, who were friends of Gorrie, were cast: Martin Cort, Peter Stenson, and Gordon Webster."]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Sandra GleesonMark EdwardsJennifer YoungKerry FrancisPeter ArnePeter CollierDonald PickeringEileen Way"]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Ronald Lacey,Donald Pickering,Anton Diffring,Patricia Denys,Annette Carrell,Peter VaughanKenneth J.
