He was born in Lockwood, Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and died in Huddersfield.\nLeadbeater was a right-handed lower order batsman, and a leg-break and googly bowler, who had a couple of good seasons for Yorkshire in 1950 and 1951, but failed to keep his place in the side. He reappeared for Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1957 and 1958, as a possible replacement for Eric Hollies, who retired after the 1957 season; but he failed to take enough wickets and his contract was not renewed.\nLeadbeater's leg-spin was always inclined to be expensive: in his two good seasons for Yorkshire, his wickets cost an average of around 25 runs apiece. His selection to replace Derbyshire's injured Bert Rhodes on the 1951-52 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of India, Pakistan and Ceylon was unexpected, and though he played in two Test matches, he was not a success. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted \"Leadbeater was more of an accurate roller, than a traditional leg spinner and his bowling posed few terrors for the Indian batsmen\". Wisden Cricketer's Almanack reported that he modified his action to avoid being too expensive on the tour: however, he was never the same bowler again, and the rest of his first-class career produced fewer than 100 wickets.\nDropping out of the Yorkshire side, he joined Warwickshire for 1957 and played fairly regularly in 1958 after Hollies retired. Though he took just 49 wickets (and only 25 of them in Championship matches), he scored his only first-class century in what proved to be his last season: going in as a nightwatchman, he made 116 and shared in a second-wicket stand of 209 with Fred Gardner in the match against Glamorgan at Coventry.\nLeadbeater is a rarity as an England Test cricketer, in that he was never awarded a county cap.After leaving first-class cricket, Leadbeater played regularly for Almondbury Cricket Club in the Huddersfield Cricket League, taking over 1,000 wickets before he retired at the age of 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 15", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 Eddie Leadbeater, English cricketer (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship, twenty points adrift of the joint winners Lancashire and Surrey.Webber, pp. 83\u201384. For the most part, Yorkshire selected from fifteen players in 1950 although a few others made occasional appearances. Yardley captained the team in which Hutton and Lowson were the established openers although, with Hutton's Test calls, there were more opportunities for Halliday and Geoffrey Keighley. Lester, Watson, Wilson and Billy Sutcliffe were the other batsmen and Brennan was the wicket-keeper. The main bowlers were Wardle, Coxon and Eddie Leadbeater. Brian Close was doing his national service and could only make a single appearance, Ellis Robinson had departed and Ron Aspinall's career had been wrecked by his injury. So Trueman and Whitehead, who made 13 appearances, contested the fourth bowling place but one of the bit players was Bob Appleyard, who would make a major impact in 1951."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Eddie Leadbeater"]}, {"page": "Bradford Premier League", "response": ["* Eddie Leadbeater (England)"]}, {"page": "Leadbeater", "response": ["* Eddie Leadbeater (1927\u20132011), former English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Huddersfield Cricket League", "response": ["* Eddie Leadbeater (1927\u20132011) \u2013 Yorkshire Warwickshire and England"]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Eddie Leadbeater, cricketer (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2011", "response": ["*Eddie Leadbeater, 83, English cricketer, after short illness."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in India, Pakistan and Ceylon in 1951\u201352", "response": ["* Eddie Leadbeater"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Eddie Leadbeater (1957\u20131958) : E.
