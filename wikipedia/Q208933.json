He helped them achieve top-flight status for the 2006\u201307 season, after which he joined Everton for a \u00a34 million fee. He later captained the club from 2013\u20132019, and totalled 385 games.

Initially organised by the Official Supporters Club the award was voted for by their members although it was presented as an official club award.  In recent years the award has been presented at a gala 'End of Season' award ceremony and dinner, usually held at the end of April, and voting has been widened to include a broader section of the club's fanbase.  The first winner of the award was long serving goalkeeper Alan Hodgkinson. The player with the most award wins is striker Alan Woodward on four occasions between 1970 and 1978.  The longest gap between wins by a player is seven years; Keith Edwards had two spells with the club and won the award during both, in 1977 and 1984. Harry Maguire and Phil Jagielka have won the award on three consecutive occasions. The award was shared between two players for the first time in 2017, with Billy Sharp and John Fleck receiving the award.", "Sheffield United's Academy is responsible for youth development at the club. It has produced such players as Manchester City defender Kyle Walker and defender Phil Jagielka, both England internationals, and also Swansea City defender Kyle Naughton, Burnley full back Matthew Lowton, Manchester United defender and club captain Harry Maguire and current club captain Billy Sharp. The Academy building and training facilities in the Sheffield suburb of Shirecliffe were opened in 2002 by then Minister for Sport Richard Caborn.

The stadium was one of several venues used as temporary home grounds for the England team while the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium took place. It hosted its first England game in 1999, when they played Belgium in a friendly match, which England won 2\u20131. It played host to its first competitive England match on 2 April 2003, when they played Turkey in a Euro 2004 qualifying match, which England won 2\u20130. The Stadium of Light also held an England under 20 match against Italy on 27 November 2002, Italy beat England 5\u20133. On 10 June 2003 it hosted an England's under-21s 2004 U21 European Championship qualifier match against Slovakia's under-21s.

In his sixth full season in charge, Moyes secured fifth place in the league and reached the semi-final of the Football League Cup as well as the last 16 of the UEFA Cup, eventually being beaten on penalties by Fiorentina. Moyes also signed four more players who went on to become very important players for Everton: Yakubu was signed for another record fee of \u00a311.25\u00a0million, Steven Pienaar for \u00a32.05\u00a0million after an initial loan, Phil Jagielka was brought in for \u00a34\u00a0million, and Leighton Baines was signed for a fee that could rise to \u00a36\u00a0million. All of this gave Everton and its fans cause for optimism as a string of strong performances broke the pattern inconsistency which saw league finishes of 15th, 7th, 17th, 4th and 11th under Moyes. His reputation as a disciplinarian could be seen to manifest in Everton's yellow card count. They received just 27 yellow cards all season \u2013 the lowest in the league and six fewer than their nearest rival Liverpool."]}, {"page": "John Heitinga", "response": ["The 2012\u201313 season proved to be less successful for Heitinga as manager David Moyes opted to play Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin for much of Everton's season. Heitinga had to wait until an injury to Jagielka gave him a sustained run in the team but poor performances which included him being culpable for all three goals in a 3\u20133 draw with Aston Villa led to him being criticised by fans. However, in April Moyes praised Heitinga's mental strength for battling back after his earlier form in the season would have \"broken\" most players. Despite this, Heitinga revealed that he had rejected Everton's offer of a new contract at the end of the year. In January 2014 Everton and West Ham United agreed terms for the transfer of Heitinga. He turned down the move however saying, \"You have to be convinced that you are taking the right step and I was not\". He scored his last goal for the team in his last outing, Everton's 4\u20130 FA Cup win against Stevenage before eventually joining Fulham on a free transfer on transfer deadline day."]}, {"page": "Thomas Gravesen", "response": ["Gravesen re-signed for Everton on a season-long loan from Celtic on 29 August 2007. On his first game back for Everton, as a second-half substitute in the 2\u20131 win at Bolton Wanderers, he took the corner that Joleon Lescott headed the winner from. In his first European appearance of the season, in Everton's 3\u20131 victory over Larissa at Goodison Park in the UEFA Cup group stage, Gravesen set up Everton's third goal, scored by Victor Anichebe. However, Gravesen failed to make as big an impact as many Everton fans had hoped. A rare highlight was scoring a penalty in the shootout following the UEFA Cup match against Fiorentina, although Everton would go on to lose the shootout when Phil Jagielka missed the crucial spot-kick. After the last game of the 2007\u201308 season, manager David Moyes confirmed that Gravesen's contract would not be renewed and he would be returning to Celtic."]}, {"page": "Battle of Bramall Lane", "response": ["|CM ||17 || Phil Jagielka"]}, {"page": "Utility player", "response": ["A few outfield players have also made competent substitute goalkeepers, for example Phil Jagielka, Jan Koller (originally trained as a goalkeeper before converting into a striker) and Cosmin Mo\u021bi. But in the case of goalkeepers playing as outfield players, it is extremely rare; David James for Manchester City in 2005 match against Middlesbrough for one instance. Some may be free kick and penalty specialists (Rog\u00e9rio Ceni, Jos\u00e9 Luis Chilavert and Jorge Campos), but they do not hold a role in the outfield. John O'Shea, a former Manchester United player, is a famous example for playing in all positions in his United career."]}, {"page": "Umbro", "response": ["Other releases by Umbro include the Stealth boot, released in 2010 and worn by players such as Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Phil Jagielka. The same year, the company released the GT, worn by then-Fulham striker Darren Bent. The company announced it as its lightest ever boot. This was succeeded by the GT II model.

Distin's centre back partnership with Phil Jagielka remained Everton's first choice through the 2013\u201314 season, despite the emergence of John Stones, with the club finishing fifth with their record Premier League points tally of 72. He signed a new one-year contract to keep him at the club until the summer of 2015."]}, {"page": "Gary Naysmith", "response": ["At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, he signed a new three-year contract with the Blues. On 5 May 2007, Naysmith scored the third goal in a 3\u20130 victory over Portsmouth The win practically guaranteed that Everton would be playing in Europe during the 2007\u201308 season. Naysmith made over 130 Premier League appearances for the Toffees before leaving the club to join Championship side Sheffield United for \u00a31 million in July 2007 as part of an exchange deal with Phil Jagielka.", "As part of the deal that took Phil Jagielka to Goodison Park, Naysmith was given permission to speak to Sheffield United to discuss a possible move.

His second season at Everton saw an increase in Baines's playing time. Due to an injury to Yobo, Lescott moved to the centre of defence and Baines played at left back. He was voted Player of the Month at Everton two months in a row in the 2008\u201309 season. Baines scored his first ever Everton goal against Portsmouth on 21 March, at Fratton Park, after 57 matches (in all competitions) without scoring. On 30 August 2009, he scored a last minute penalty in a 2\u20131 win over his former team Wigan.
