He and Colin Moulding each acted as a songwriter and frontman for XTC, with Partridge writing and singing about two-thirds of the group's material.  While the band were a formative punk group, Partridge's music drew heavily from 1960s songwriters, and his style gradually shifted to more traditional pop, often with pastoral themes. The band's only UK top 10 hit, \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982), was written by Partridge.\nPartridge is sometimes regarded as the \"godfather\" of Britpop. Since the 1980s, he has worked, written with, or produced for many other recording artists\u2014efforts which include collaborative albums with Peter Blegvad, Harold Budd and Robyn Hitchcock.

Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following there and in Japan. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.", "Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding grew up on Penhill council estate in Swindon. Partridge jokingly characterised the community as being populated almost entirely by people with physical, mental or emotional defects. In the 1960s, he was a fan of contemporary pop groups like the Beatles, but was intimidated by the process of learning guitar. When the Monkees grew popular, he became interested in joining a music group. He recalled watching local guitarist Dave Gregory performing Jimi Hendrix-style songs at churches and youth clubs: \"Sort of acid-skiffle. I thought, 'Ah, one day I'll play guitar!' But I didn't think I would be in the same band as this kid on the stage.\" Partridge eventually obtained a guitar and taught himself how to play it with no formal training. At the age of 15, he wrote his first song, titled \"Please Help Me\", and attracted the nickname \"Rocky\" for his early guitar mastery of the Beatles' \"Rocky Raccoon\" (1968). By the early 1970s, his music tastes had transitioned \"from the Monkees to having a big binge on this Euro-avant-garde stuff. I got really in deep.\" One of his first bands was called \"Stiff Beach\", formed in August 1970. In early 1972, Partridge's constantly evolving group settled into \"Star Park\", a four-piece that featured himself with guitarist Dave Cartner, drummer Paul Wilson, and a bassist nicknamed \"Nervous Steve\".", "XTC's principal songwriters were guitarist Andy Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding. Partridge, who wrote the majority of XTC's songs, was the group's frontman and de facto leader. He drove the band's image, designed many of their record sleeves, and handled most of their interviews. His involvement with XTC's record sleeves stemmed from his disappointment with the sleeve for the \"Statue of Liberty\" single, which depicted a poorly cropped photo of the statue and the XTC logo in red. He was less successful in his attempts to involve himself in the band's music videos, as he said, the woman in charge of Virgin's video department rebuked all his ideas, some of which other groups later adopted in award-winning videos.", "Discussing the band's relative obscurity and lack of financial success, Schabe said that \"it's difficult to justify claims of greatness without trying to understand exactly why they never managed to rise above the status of cult band. Respect and recognition are the real validation of such claims\". Andy Partridge characterized the band as \"quietly influential\" and thought that the decision to quit touring \"definitely affected our popularity later on\". Schabe disagreed that the lack of touring had an effect and wrote that \"XTC suffered more from the hands of industry forces than they did from failure to find an audience.\" Partridge also estimated that XTC's fan demographic had a male/female ratio of about 60\u201340, which was \"reassuring\" to him, as he thought the band only appealed to \"computer nerds\".

Frusciante wanted an album of two different types of songs: songs that were more \"English-sounding\" and melodic, and songs that were more influenced by punk rock. Frusciante's punk inspiration came from listening to music by The Damned and Discharge, among others.RHCP, Mullen 2010. p. 210 Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material.
