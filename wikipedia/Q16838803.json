She was born at St James's Palace as the daughter of a diplomat and a maid of honour to Caroline of Ansbach. In 1754, she married John Spencer, one of the wealthiest men of the era. A love match, the marriage resulted in the births of three surviving children, who included Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. The Spencers became earl and countess in 1765, a reward granted by the Duke of Newcastle for John's political loyalty to the Whig party.\nLady Spencer was a noted philanthropist, and was in communication with a large network of charitable organisations. Her correspondence with a friend represents the largest private collection of letters in the British Library. Lord and Lady Spencer were generous patrons, and frequently hosted plays and concerts at their London estate, Spencer House, which they built in 1764.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Duchess (film)", "response": ["* Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana Spencer, Countess Spencer, Georgiana's mother"]}, {"page": "Countess Spencer", "response": ["* Georgiana Spencer, Countess Spencer (1737\u20131814), wife of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer"]}, {"page": "William Stephen Poyntz", "response": ["Poyntz was the son of William Poyntz of Midgham (d.1809) by his wife Isabella (d.1805), daughter and co-heir of Kellond Courtenay of Painsford in Devon.
