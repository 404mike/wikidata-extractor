Parry played for Derby Boys and signed for the Rams in July 1948, a time when Raich Carter and Billy Steel were at the club. A one-club man, Parry remained at The Baseball Ground for 20 years and set a club record 482 League appearances up to the 1965/66 season (517 in total) until Kevin Hector overtook it. Parry is also the Rams ninth highest goalscorer in all competitions with 110 goals, and fifth highest League goalscorer (105 goals).An inside forward, Parry made his debut aged 17, and scored, in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Aston Villa in April 1949. He played sporadically until the last four games of the 1950/51 season and was leading scorer in 1951/52 with 11 goals in 28 League games. Parry's best scoring season was 24 goals in 34 League games in 1955/56 but was injured by Ray de Gruchy's challenge playing Grimsby Town at The Baseball Ground in March 1956. The back injury sustained in the game meant Parry was sidelined for the rest of the season and without his goals, Grimsby went on to win the Third Division North and take the only promotion place. The injury limited Parry's contribution the following season and he made 18 appearances, scoring seven goals, as Derby won the title. In the Second Division Parry became club captain and converted to wing-half but eventually lost his place in the 1965/66 season before moving on to Boston United.\nParry was a popular member of the dressing room. One well-known tale is when trainer Ralph Hann was treating him in a match for suspected concussion. Hann asked Parry where he was. \"I'm at Wembley\" said Parry. \"We're beating Brazil 2-0 - and I've scored both.\"His four brothers were also footballers: Cyril played for Notts County, Ray for Bolton Wanderers and England, and Reg and Glynn, who both played in non-league.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Parry", "response": ["*Jack Parry (1924\u20132010), Welsh footballer", "*Jack Parry (English footballer) (born 1931), English footballer with Derby County"]}, {"page": "List of Derby County F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Johnny Morris Jack Parry", "| Jack Parry", "| Jack Parry"]}, {"page": "Jack Parry", "response": ["*Jack Parry at Pride of Anglia"]}, {"page": "List of Derby County F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["!Jack Parry", "!Jack Parry"]}, {"page": "List of English association football families", "response": ["* Jack Parry, Ray Parry (brother), Cyril Parry (brother)"]}]}}
