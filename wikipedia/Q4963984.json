He subsequently worked for various stations in Perth and Western Australia, in both presenting and producing roles.\nHe moved to the UK and joined Capital Radio at its inception in 1973, first as a producer of talk programmes, and then presenting Capital Open Line, before making his name as presenter of the morning interview and phone-in show on LBC Radio from 1976 to 1990. Here he adopted an often aggressive style with callers \u2013 making it clear he did not suffer fools gladly. Though this sometimes caused irritation it was a valuable asset to the station. (He was once satirised in Private Eye as \u2018Brian Bastard').\nSince 1990 Hayes has appeared on various stations, including presenting the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show throughout 1992, which was subtitled Good Morning UK throughout his tenure. He left the show at the end of the year due to unpopularity, and he was replaced by the show's former host Terry Wogan in January 1993.\nHayes presented the weekly phone-in Hayes over Britain on BBC Radio 2 in the 1990s, winning a Gold Sony Radio Award for 'Best Phone-In', a programme on Euthanasia, as well as sitting in for Jimmy Young and his successor Jeremy Vine until 2006. He worked on BBC Radio 5 Live until 2006, and BBC Radio 4, on various programmes including Not Today, Thank You. During the mid-2000s, he presented Friday nights on BBC Radio 5 Live and on Sunday nights he returned to LBC.\nHe is mentioned on the song Hello by The Beloved.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 17", "response": ["*1937 \u2013 Brian Hayes, Australian-English radio host"]}, {"page": "Harry Shearer", "response": ["In 2006 Shearer appeared with Brian Hayes in four episodes of the BBC Radio 4 sitcom Not Today, Thank You, playing Nostrils, a man so ugly he cannot stand to be in his own presence.

Much of the entertainment came from letters and emails sent in by listeners, many of whom adopted punning pseudonyms.
