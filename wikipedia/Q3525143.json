In 1891 he was appointed as Conservator of Forests, a position he retained till his retirement in June 1908. He was a keen botanist and an all-round forest officer. During his period, he brought the Department to a high state of efficiency.\nIn 1908, he authored the first book on the trees of the region The Forest Trees of Travancore. In 1901 he was admitted a Fellow of the Linnean Society. He also wrote about bird life to Allan Octavian Hume and contributed many articles on forestry to the Indian Forester. He worked in close association with other naturalists of his time including R. H. Beddome and Harold S. Ferguson.\nToday there exists in Arienkavu on the northern side of Shendurney valley a place called Bourdillon's Plot which was the location of the first plot where teak was planted using stumps in 1891. This technique was developed to grow teak sustainably for the needs of the navy. This attempt to grow teak for the needs of the Royal Navy was started by Mr. H. V. Conolly, the then Collector of Malabar.\nThe tree species Aglaia bourdillonii, bird subspecies great eared-nightjar Eurostopodus macrotis bourdilloni and the blackbird Turdus merula bourdilloni are named after him.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Indian natural history", "response": ["Some of the other prominent names associated with botany and forests of India include William Carey (1761\u20131834), Sir Henry Collett (1836\u20131901), Ethelbert Blatter (1877\u20141934), T.

Jerdon obtained a specimen of the rufous-bellied species from the Nilgiris and called it Phaenicura major (\"Large Red-start\") in 1844 but Edward Blyth suggested that the species should be placed in the genus Callene that he had separated from the already extant Brachypteryx, a genus in which he also placed the blue-fronted robin (now Cinclidium frontale then Callene frontalis). Jerdon then suggested the new name of Callene rufiventris, a name not used due to the priority given to the names first proposed. Eugene Oates in the first edition of The Fauna of British India moved the species back into the genus Brachypteryx stating that they were congeneric with Brachypteryx cruralis while also noting that the young birds were speckled as in true-thrushes like Callene (as represented by the blue-fronted robin). Oates also used the name \"Rufous-bellied Short-wing\". This genus placement was carried on in the second edition of The Fauna of British India (1924) by E. C.

Claud Buchanan Ticehurst in 1939 reaffirmed the genus placement.

In 2010, DNA sequence studies suggested an ancient divergence in these two populations and confirmed their elevation to full species. Another 2010 molecular phylogenetics study suggested that the genus Brachypteryx (the taxa sampled however, did not include the peninsular Indian forms) which was earlier thought to belong to the thrush family Turdidae belonged to the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The type species of Brachypteryx, B. montana, shows strong sexual dimorphism. The genus position was however not settled until 2017 and it was found based on a larger sampling that the species from southern India formed a group that is sister to the flycatchers in the genera Eumyias, Cyanoptila, Niltava, Cyornis and Anthipes. This led to the erection of the new genus Sholicola."]}, {"page": "T F Bourdillon", "response": ["#REDIRECT T. F. Bourdillon "]}, {"page": "T.F. Bourdillon", "response": ["#REDIRECT T. F.
