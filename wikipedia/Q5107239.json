He later managed in non-league football.\nLightfoot spent much of his career with Chester City, where he came through the youth ranks to make his debut as a 17-year-old on 19 September 1987 in a 1\u20130 win over Grimsby Town. He scored his first goal in his next appearance against Walsall in November 1987 and ended the season with 17 first team appearances to his name. Lightfoot joined fellow youngsters such as Brian Croft, Robbie Painter and Colin Woodthorpe in emerging from the Chester youth set-up to become first-team regulars during this period.\nIn future seasons Lightfoot was a regular in the Chester side, making more than 30 league appearances in each season until 1993\u201394. By this point Lightfoot had been converted by Graham Barrow from a central defender to an attacking midfielder, reflected in his 14 goals as Chester won promotion from Division Three.\nIn the summer of 1995 Lightfoot followed Barrow to Wigan Athletic for a tribunal fee of \u00a387,500. However, by March 1996 he was on the move again when he joined Crewe Alexandra. In May 1997 Lightfoot appeared as a substitute as Crewe beat Brentford in the Division Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium, giving Lightfoot his first chance to play in the second tier in English football.\nLightfoot's final taste of league football came during a loan spell with Oldham Athletic in the early weeks of the 2000\u201301 season. At the end of the campaign he left Crewe and joined Conference side Morecambe, where he played for one season. In 2002, he joined Runcorn, who he became manager of in October 2003 \n.\nHe was sacked 12 months later \n.After spells with Marine and Leek Town, Lightfoot ended his playing days with two appearances for NEWI Cefn Druids.Chris is now a taxi driver in Warrington", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry McNally", "response": ["During his early years at the club, McNally had given Football League debuts to several players who went on to have long professional careers.
