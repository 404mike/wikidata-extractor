After spending time out on loan at Chesterfield in 2017\u201318, he broke into the first team at Oakwell, helping them gain promotion to the Championship in 2018\u201319. In September 2020 he joined Stoke City for an undisclosed fee. \nBorn and raised in England, Brown was selected by the Scotland national football team in November 2021, being eligible through his mother who is from Glasgow.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael O'Neill (footballer)", "response": ["Due to the ongoing pandemic the 2020\u201321 season began later in September with matches continuing to played behind closed doors. O'Neill brought in a number of free transfers including James Chester, Morgan Fox, Steven Fletcher and Mikel John Obi with Jacob Brown the only arrival to have been bought. Stoke began the season well with Tyrese Campbell in decent form, winning eight of their first 16 matches and were just outside the play-off places at the beginning of December. However a number of injuries to key players most notably to Tyrese Campbell saw goals dry up and the team went nine games without a win at the turn of the year. Stoke were unable to put a sustained run of results together in March and April and ended the season in mid-table."]}, {"page": "Adam Chicksen", "response": ["At the start of the 2018\u201319 season, Chicksen started the season when he became first team regular for the side, playing in the midfield position before returning to the left\u2013back position. During a 2\u20130 loss against Barnsley on 11 August 2018, he suffered a head wound, but was quickly fit. However, Chicksen suffered a leg injury that kept him out for two months. It wasn't until on 3 November 2018 when Chicksen made his return to the starting line-up against Portsmouth, but was sent\u2013off in the 83rd minute for a second bookable offence, in a 1\u20130 loss. Since returning from a one match suspension, he received regular playing time for the next two months. During this run, Chicksen helped the club keep two clean sheets in a row on two separate occasions; which the first one came between 15 December 2018 and 22 December 2018 and the second one came on between 29 December 2018 and 1 January 2019. In a follow\u2013up match against Barnsley, he was sent\u2013off in the 89th minute for a foul on Jacob Brown, in a 3\u20130 loss and served a two match suspension as a result. After serving a two match suspension, Chicksen continued to fight for his first team place in the left\u2013back position, alongside Calum Woods and Connor Wood. However, he lost his first team place later in the season, due to being dropped from the squad and his own injury concerns; Bradford City was relegated to League Two. At the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Chicksen went on to make thirty\u2013three appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Alex Mowatt", "response": ["Mowatt returned to Barnsley ahead of the 2018\u201319 season after their relegation to League One. He formed a key partnership in midfield with teammate Cameron McGeehan. The pair played together in 39 of Barnsley's 46 league matches, Mowatt appearing in all of them. Mowatt scored his first goal of the season in a 1\u20131 draw against Plymouth Argyle on 2 October 2018. On 27 October 2018, Mowatt scored the only goal of the game in a 1\u20130 home victory over Bristol Rovers through a left-footed shot from outside the area. On 12 January 2019, Mowatt put in a man of the match performance in a 3\u20130 victory against Bradford City, assisting the first two goals for Jacob Brown and Kieffer Moore and scoring the third himself. Mowatt scored two goals over Easter weekend, the first in a 2\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town at Oakwell on 19 April 2019, the second in a 3\u20130 over Plymouth Argyle at Home Park on 22 April 2019."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["|35||Jacob Brown||ST||||Halifax||||2||0||Academy||1 July 2016||Trainee||2018", "| 31 January 2018 || CF ||  || Jacob Brown || Chesterfield || 30 June 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 January 2018 || CF ||  || Jacob Brown || Barnsley || 30 June 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["|33||Jacob Brown||ST||||Halifax||||40||8||Academy||1 July 2016||Trainee||2021", "|33||||CF||Jacob Brown              ||8||0||0||0||8", "|33||||CF||Jacob Brown              ||5||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0||1"]}]}}
