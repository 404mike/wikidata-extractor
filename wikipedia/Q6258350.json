As a result of his actions, trial by court martial and subsequent death whilst under imprisonment, Smith became known as the \"Demerara Martyr\". His case, and news of the enormous size of the uprising and the brutal loss of African life, caused a great awakening in England, strengthening the abolitionist cause which eventually succeeded in British territories worldwide in 1838.", "link_mentions": {}}}
