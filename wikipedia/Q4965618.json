A former joint investigations editor of The Sunday Times, he left the title at the time of the Wapping dispute. For a period during 1987, he was editor of the short-lived News on Sunday tabloid. The newspaper published extracts from Spycatcher by Peter Wright in August 1987 while Whitaker was editor. The title was eventually fined \u00a350,000 in May 1989 for contempt of court in breaking an injunction upheld by the Law Lords shortly before publication.Whitaker worked for the British newspaper The Guardian from 1987 and was its Middle East editor from 2000 to 2007.

There is no monolithic answer. As a translation service it is of great value. As a research tool the evaluation is more complex as it demands good background information in order to contextualize the information obtained, due to the organization's lack of transparency and attempt to pose as something different than what they are. The problem is that many of the journalists, politicians and lay persons who use MEMRI cannot and will not do this. And this is where the main objection to MEMRI comes into play. It presents itself as an independent research institute, but it acts as a tool geared toward shaping opinion by \"producing an orient\"\u2014in the true sense of Edward Said's usage\u2014and through this it has an increasing influence in shaping perceptions of the Middle East. MEMRI has understood that politics today is waged in the media and it fulfills its role as a public relations, lobbying and policy-making instrument with the highest professional standard.\" aims to portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light through the production and dissemination of incomplete or inaccurate translations and by selectively translating views of extremists while deemphasizing or ignoring mainstream opinions.", "Brian Whitaker, then the Middle East editor for The Guardian, wrote in a public email debate with Carmon in 2003, that his problem with MEMRI was that it \"poses as a research institute when it's basically a propaganda operation\". Earlier, Whitaker had charged that MEMRI's role was to \"further the political agenda of Israel.\" and that MEMRI's website does not mention Carmon's employment for Israeli intelligence, or Meyrav Wurmser's political stance, which he described as an \"extreme brand of Zionism\". Carmon responded to this by stating that his employment history is not a secret and was not political, as he served under opposing administrations of the Israeli government and that perhaps the issue was that he was Israeli: \"If your complaint is that I am Israeli, then please say so.\" Carmon also questioned Whitaker's own biases, wondering if Whitaker's is biased in favor of Arabs \u2013 as his website on the Middle East is named \"Al-Bab\" (\"The Gateway\" in Arabic) \u2013 stating: \"I wonder how you would judge an editor whose website was called \"Ha-Sha-ar\" (\"The Gateway\" in Hebrew)?"]}, {"page": "Azar Nafisi", "response": ["In a 2003 article for The Guardian, Brian Whitaker criticized Nafisi for working for the public relations firm Benador Associates which he argued promoted the neo-conservative ideas of  \"creative destruction\" and \"total war\"."]}, {"page": "Media Lens", "response": ["In June 2017, the German newspaper Die Welt published an article by Seymour Hersh in which he said the attack by the Syrian government at Khan Shaykhun in April 2017 did not involve sarin and that US intelligence knew this. Hersh wrote that his sources said the attack struck a building which housed \"fertilisers, disinfectants and other goods\". Media Lens tweeted that their search of a newspaper database showed no mention of Hersh\u2019s report. In June 2017, journalist Brian Whitaker criticised Media Lens for being unconcerned that Hersh had not provided the sources for his story. Whitaker wrote that Media Lens had previously criticised The Guardian for quoting \"unnamed American officials\" in a story about Iraq."]}, {"page": "Media coverage of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict", "response": ["Several studies have concluded that \"terminology bias\" has been a recurrent feature of coverage of the conflict,Frank Luntz, 'The Israel Project\u2019s 2009 GLOBAL LANGUAGE DICTIONARY,'  The Israel Project 2009Loubna Qutami and Omar Zahzah, 'The War of Words: Language as an Instrument of Palestinian National Struggle,' Arab Studies Quarterly, Vol. 42, No. 1-2 (Winter/Spring 2020), pp. 66-90. and scholars and commentators like Yasir Suleiman and Peter Beinart argue that language manipulation plays an important role in endeavours to win over the international public, with some concluding that Israel has proven more adept in this battle. So too Greg Myre wrote of the rise of a \"verbal arms race\" where \"(m)uch of the Mideast conflict is about winning international support\", one which escalated with the onset of the Al-Aqsa Intifada. Brian Whitaker, reviewing 1,659 articles covering events in the Guardian and Evening Standard for this period (2000\u20132001), observed the same effects, adding that omission of important adjectives was notable: 66% failed to mention that the incidents took place in an occupied territory. Hebron was described as a divided city, though 99% of its inhabitants are Palestinian, whereas Israel describes Jerusalem as \"undivided\" though a third of its inhabitants are Palestinian. Likewise, Jews live in \"communities\", Palestinians in \"areas\".  In his view Israel had won the verbal war. East Jerusalem is not \"occupied\" or a cultural and spiritual centre for Muslims and Arabs for 14 centuries, but \"the eternal, indivisible capital of Israel\" and \"reunited\". In reporting the capture of Gilad Shalit on Israeli soil and his removal to the Gaza Strip, and Israel's response of detaining 60 Hamas members, half Palestinian West Bank parliamentarians, the former was said to have been kidnapped while the latter, seized from their beds in night raids and removed to Israeli prisons, were arrested.

Acknowledgment of these differences is frequently suppressed usually in the cause of \"national unity\" and sometimes to obscure the fact that minority elite is controlling the country. Brian Whitaker argues that this leads to the formation of political parties on ethnic, religious or regional divisions, rather than over policy differences. Voting therefore becomes an assertion of one's identity rather than a real choice.", "The problem with oil and the wealth it generates is that the states' rulers have the wealth to remain in power, as they can pay off or repress most potential opponents. Brian Whitaker argues that as there is no need for taxation there is less pressure for representation. Furthermore, Western governments require a stable source of oil and are therefore more prone to maintain the status quo, rather than push for reforms which may lead to periods of instability. This can be linked into political economy explanations for the occurrence of authoritarian regimes and lack of democracy in the Middle East, particularly the prevalence of rentier states in the Middle East.Beblawi, H., 1990, The Rentier State in the Arab World, in Luciani, G., The Arab State, London, Routledge A consequence of the lack of taxation that Whitaker talks of in such rentier economies is an inactive civil society. As civil society is seen to be an integral part of democracy it raises doubts over the feasibility of democracy developing in the Middle East in such situations."]}, {"page": "History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt", "response": ["Over the next ten years the Brotherhood made repeated calls for a more democratic political system.
