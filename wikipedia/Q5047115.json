The sport of cricket in this period had already acquired most of its modern features such as eleven-a-side, the three-stump wicket and the lbw law, although pitch preparation was rudimentary and play was largely dictated by the weather. The main difference was in bowling which was still mostly underarm, the key development of the period being the movement towards roundarm bowling which began in the late eighteenth century and was gathering pace by 1825.\nThe principal club throughout the period was Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in 1787. MCC organised the early Gentlemen v Players matches and most of the games played by occasional XIs such as those led by Colonel Lennox, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, George Osbaldeston and others. Inter-county cricket was rare during the Napoleonic Wars and there were no formally constituted county clubs at the time, but the main centres at county level were Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. Towards the end of the period, Cambridge University became prominent, especially through its series of matches against the Cambridge Town Club. In the north of England, cricket was developing through town clubs which became the focal points of the game in their respective counties, especially Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1787 and 1825 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carter (name)", "response": ["Carter is a family name, and also may be a given name. Carter is of Irish, Scottish and English origin and is an occupational name given to one who transports goods by cart or wagon ultimately of Irish and Celtic derivation and an Irish reduced form of the name McCarter or the Scottish-Gaelic Mac Artair with Mc meaning son of and its appearance and pronunciation as Carter being the Anglicized form of the Irish Mac Art\u00fair. The name is related to the Gaelic word cairt meaning cart, and ultimately from the Latin carettarius. Additionally, in Gaelic, the word \"cairtear\", which means tourist or sojourner, is also related. It is the 44th most common surname in the United States, 56th most common in England, 428th most common in Ireland, where it is found with greatest frequency in County Laois as the 70th most common surname, and 274th in Scotland.", "People of European heritage bearing this surname may trace their ancestors back to Ireland, England or Scotland. Within the past 150 years, the Carter surname has been adopted widely by African Americans taken from slavemasters by former slaves upon the Emancipation and 13th Amendment or through the common mixing found between Irish immigrants and free African Americans. This name is common among African Americans capable of tracing their roots back to the southern United States or Caribbean from the early 20th century onward, with some 35% of name holders of Carter in the United States being of African-American descent and it being the 22nd most common surname for Black Americans.", "*Aaron Carter (born 1987), American musician", "*Ad Carter (1895\u20131957), American comic strip cartoonist", "*Adam Carter (footballer) (born 1994), Australian rules footballer from Western Australia", "*Adrian Carter (born 1959), British architect", "*Aimee Carter (born 1986), American writer", "*Al Carter, (born 1952), American journalist", "*Alan Carter (disambiguation)", "*Albert Carter (disambiguation)", "*Alex Carter (disambiguation)", "*Ali Carter (born 1979), English professional snooker player", "*Allen 'Big Al' Carter (1947\u20132008), American artist", "*Ally Carter (born 1974), American author", "*Amanda Carter (born 1964), Australian Paralympic basketball player", "*Amon G.
