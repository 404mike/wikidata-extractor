Winton herself recalled that she had problems with BBC editorial staff rather than the public.

In 2000, shortly before the series' BBC revival, Brian Viner remarked in Radio Times that Thunderbirds was on the point of \"captivating yet another generation of viewers\". Stuart Hood, writing for The Spectator in 1965, praised Thunderbirds as a \"modern fairy tale\"; adding that it \"can sometimes be frightening\", he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents.

Trade newspaper Kinematograph Weekly devoted its TV column to the show on 24 October; journalist Tony Gruner described the show as \"a somewhat mysterious type of programme consisting in part of fantasy and realism\". A trailer for the show was broadcast on the BBC on 16 November. The first serial was given a half-page preview in Radio Times on 21 November, outlining the show's main characters and upcoming settings. On the same day, the main cast and production team attended the show's launch at Room 222 of the BBC's Broadcasting House. Hartnell hosted a radio trailer for the show on the BBC Light Programme. The BBC Home Service programme Today hosted a one-minute piece about the show's \"space music\" on 22 November, and a second trailer for the show was screened on BBC in the evening.", "Doctor Whos first season received generally positive responses. For An Unearthly Child, Variety felt that the script \"suffered from a glibness of characterisations which didn't carry the burden of belief\", but praised the \"effective camerawork\", noting that the show \"will impress if it decides to establish a firm base in realism\". Mary Crozier of The Guardian was unimpressed by the first serial, stating that it \"has fallen off badly soon after getting underway\". Conversely, Marjorie Norris of Television Today commented that if the show \"keeps up the high standard of the first two episodes it will capture a much wider audience\". The following serial, The Daleks, was widely praised, described by the Daily Mirrors Richard Sear as \"splendid children's stuff\". The serial's villains, the Daleks, became a cultural phenomenon, and have been closely associated with the show since. The Edge of Destruction was criticised at a BBC Programme Review Board Meeting in February 1964 by controller of television programmes Stuart Hood, who felt that the serial's sequences in which Susan uses scissors as a weapon \"digressed from the code of violence in programmes\"; Lambert apologised for the scenes."]}, {"page": "2011 in Scottish television", "response": ["*31 January \u2013 Stuart Hood, 94, writer and television producer"]}, {"page": "1915 in Scotland", "response": ["* 17 December \u2013 Stuart Hood novelist, translator, television producer and Controller of BBC Television (died 2011)"]}, {"page": "Stuart C.

A couple of weeks earlier he gave orders that all the Ciano papers should be destroyed. However, Hilde Beetz had somehow got hold of two volumes of Ciano diaries that had been left by Edda while a patient at the \"La Ramiola\" clinic at Parma shortly before her husband was executed. These covered the important pre-war period from 1937 till 1939. It is not clear whether Beetz had the originals or merely micro-fiched copies of them. In the summer of 1944, by now back in Weimar living with her mother in the house where she had grown up, she was instructed to produce translations of them all. These, it turns out, are the papers (or possibly only some of the papers) identified in the US intelligence report produced by Lt. Col. Andrew H. Berding in June 1945. Beetz had sorted them and hid them in her parents' garden during the early months of 1945. They were buried in a tin under a bed of roses which has led to them being identified in some sources, subsequently, as the \"Rose Garden\" papers. The diaries covered in some detail notes of conversations and correspondence that Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano had conducted with Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and the seemingly ever-lasting German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. English and French political leaders also featured. In 1948 an English-language version was published in London in a volume, which also included diary extracts from the early 1940s, entitled \"Ciano\u2019s Diplomatic Papers\",Ray Moseley: Zwischen Hitler und Mussolini.
