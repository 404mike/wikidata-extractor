He discovered the St Kilda wren and a new species in North Africa.  He collaborated with Henry Seebohm on his great work on British Birds, in the second volume of which he summarized and modified A. R. Wallace's theory of the relation between nests and coloration of birds. Elliott Coues wrote in the preface to the American edition of Dixon's book \"Rural bird life\" pointing out the originality of the observations made from the field and Julian Huxley noted Dixon for recognizing the value of prismatic binoculars for bird study. In his later years, he wrote in the newspapers on agricultural fairs and horse shows.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elliott Coues", "response": ["* Rural Bird Life of England, with Charles Dixon (1895)"]}, {"page": "Charles Dixon", "response": ["Charles Dixon may refer to:", "*Charles Dixon (artist) (1872\u20131934), British maritime artist", "*Charles Dixon (ornithologist) (1858\u20131926), English ornithologist", "*Charles Dixon (judge) (died 1817), British judge and politician ", "*Charles Dixon (bodybuilder), American professional bodybuilder"]}, {"page": "Long-tailed thrush", "response": ["The scientific name, Zoothera dixoni, is named after ornithologist Charles Dixon."]}, {"page": "Alfred Thomas Elwes", "response": ["* The birds of our rambles : A companion for the country (1891) by Charles Dixon.", "* The Game Birds And Wild Fowl Of The British Islands: Being A Handbook For The Naturalist And Sportsman (1893) by Charles Dixon.", "* Birds' nests; an introduction to the science of caliology (1902) by Charles Dixon."]}, {"page": "1892 in birding and ornithology", "response": ["*Charles Dixon (1892).
