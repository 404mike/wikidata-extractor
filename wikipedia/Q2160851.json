Manuel and Westfall both suggested that there might have been a sentimental or sexual element to the attachment between both men, and that Newton's nervous breakdown in 1693 might have been connected with a rupture in that relationship.  A similar interpretation appears in Michael White's popular biography Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer (1997).  On the other hand, historian Scott Mandelbrote writes:", "Fatio's connection with Newton has been treated in several works of historical fiction.  He appears as a supporting character in Michael White's novel Equinox (2006), in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle (2003\u201304), and in Gregory Keyes's novel series The Age of Unreason (1998\u20132001)."]}, {"page": "Michael White", "response": ["* Michael White (psychotherapist) (1948\u20132008), inventor of narrative therapy", "* L.

The Tolkien scholar Janet Brennan Croft, reviewing the book for World Literature Today, wrote that Garth had ably portrayed Tolkien's early life with his close friends, using their own papers and their British Army company records. She found the first part of the book \"somewhat leisurely\", but the account of Tolkien's training and battlefield experience was \"gripping\". Luke Shelton, editor of Mallorn, the journal of the Tolkien Society, called Tolkien and the Great War an excellent book on how the First World War might have shaped Tolkien's thought. Will Sherwood, writing in the Journal of Tolkien Research, calls the book, along with Croft's 2004 War and the Works of J.R.R. Tolkien, \"essential, landmark publications on the topic [that] have sparked further [re]searches into Tolkien's wartime experiences.\" Chad Engbers, in The Lion and the Unicorn, writes that Garth, \"like most excellent literary biographers\", combines internal and external histories throughout, and comments that it is \"strange\" that nobody had thought of writing a biography of Tolkien's war years before, all the earlier biographies such as Humphrey Carpenter's, Joseph Pearce's, or Michael White's focusing on the \"older Tolkien, a kindly, wrinkled Oxford don in a tweed coat\". The scholar of English literature Robert Tally, discussing whether Tolkien demonized the enemy, notes that in the book Garth suggests that Tolkien may have linked his early ideas of goblins and trolls to Germans, but that Garth makes clear that Tolkien later expressed clear anti-racist views."]}]}}
