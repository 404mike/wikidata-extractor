In 1981 Owen Beattie, an anthropologist from the University of Alberta, examined remains from sites associated with the expedition. This led to further investigations and the examination of tissue and bone from the frozen bodies of three seamen, John Torrington, William Braine and John Hartnell, exhumed from the permafrost of Beechey Island. Laboratory tests revealed high concentrations of lead in all three (the expedition carried 8,000 tins of food sealed with a lead-based solder). Another researcher has suggested botulism caused deaths among crew members.

Through the exhumation in 1984 and 1986 of the frozen bodies of Petty Officer John Torrington, Able-bodied Seaman John Hartnell and Royal Marine William Braine, on Beechey Island, Beattie was able to trace the source of the lead to the expedition's tinned food supply.Owen Beverly BeattieWhy our explanation of the 1845 polar tragedy should be put on ice"]}, {"page": "Braine, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Braine"]}, {"page": "Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition", "response": ["Part Two of the book focuses on the exhumation of the three graves on Beechey Island and the autopsies performed on the exhumed bodies of the crewmen to further determine the cause of death. Each grave included a headstone which provided important details such as name, age and year of death and the graves were of Petty Officer John Torrington, Able-bodied Seaman John Hartnell and Royal Marine William Braine. Beattie had obtained exhumation and reburial permits from the government of the Northwest Territories, notification of permission from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and clearance from the Chief Medical Officer. In the book, Beattie and Geiger provide extensive details on the investigation and autopsy work along with photographs of the bodies and the gravesite for later restoration. After careful exhumation, the bodies were shown to be remarkably well preserved, due to the surrounding permafrost, allowing for testing on preserved tissue. The autopsies determined that tuberculosis, scurvy and lead poisoning were large factors in the deaths of these men. Near the gravesite, Beattie had discovered a pile of tin cans, which was the storage for food on the Franklin expedition. Through forensic testing, the lead soldering found on the cans matched the lead found in the bodies, determining that lead from the cans had contaminated the food supply and caused the deaths of many in the Franklin expedition. There is a portion of the book in which Beattie and Geiger use the evidence to theoretically reconstruct the final hours of the three Franklin crewmen in a way they believe may have happened as well as theoretical descriptions of how the burial processes transpired on Beechey Island in 1846."]}, {"page": "Robert Anstruther Goodsir", "response": ["Goodsir's second voyage to the Arctic took place in 1850.

This expedition had been backed by the Admiralty after pressure from Lady Franklin, who had helped finance it. On this expedition  Goodsir explored the east  and north coasts of Cornwallis Island.   During this journey he made the discovery on Beechey Island of the graves of three members of the Franklin Expedition, John Torrington, William Braine and John Hartnell.

The ships were trapped in ice northwest of King William Island in 1846. In April 1848, the ships were still beset by the ice, in the northern Victoria Strait and twenty-one men including John Franklin had died. On 22 April 1848, Francis Crozier and one-hundred-four more surviving officers and men deserted the ships, moved equipment including small boats across twenty-eight kilometres of sea ice and encamped on the northwest corner of King William Island, only a few kilometres south of Victory Point. Four days later, they set off to find the Back River and help from a Hudson Bay Company post on the Canadian mainland. ", "The skull belonging to Gregory was found at NgLj-3 with one of his molars being given the designation NgLj-3:34 and subjected to genetic and isotopic analysis. The archaeological DNA of twenty-nine expedition personnel has been analyzed as of 2021, with twenty-three coming from sites in Erebus Bay. Seventeen self-identified descendants of expedition personnel have submitted DNA samples for comparison. The first sixteen found no matches, but the seventeenth matched with John Gregory. Jonathan Gregory (b. 1982) from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, John Gregory's great-great-great-grandson was confirmed a DNA match to NgLj-3:34 in 2021 by a team of researchers from University of Waterloo, Lakehead University, and Trent University. Gregory was the first expedition member to be identified using DNA analysis. Gregory is the sixth expedition member to have his remains identified by any means, after John Torrington, John Hartnell, William Braine, John Irving, and Harry Goodsir. As of 2021, no other remains have been matched with DNA samples. The identification of Gregory has been described as one of the most important developments in Franklin expedition research in 2021."]}]}}
