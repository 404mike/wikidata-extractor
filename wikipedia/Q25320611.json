He was born at New Eltham in south-east London and died at Chobham in Surrey.\nSheffield was a professional right-arm in-swing fast-medium bowler and a useful right-handed lower-order batsman who had a briefly successful cricket career before he was forced to retire through back injury. He played for Surrey's second eleven in the Minor Counties competition from 1928 and made his first-class debut in 1930. He played regularly for Surrey in 1931 until injury ended his season early and topped the county's bowling averages with 64 wickets at 19.64 runs per wicket; the wickets included a return of seven for 123 against Somerset in his first match of the season which were the best innings figures of his career. He also showed occasional batting ability, including an unbeaten innings of 64 in the game against Essex.Injury meant that Sheffield's cricket career did not develop from this promising beginning: he played a few games in 1932 but was not re-engaged by Surrey at the end of the season, and in five matches for Kent in 1933 he took only 10 wickets, and did not return for the 1934 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Cresswell", "response": ["A board of Naval and Marine flag and general officers submitted Cresswell's name to Secretary of the Navy Edward Sheffield (Dean Stockwell) for the position, but allegations of impropriety prompted the Secretary of Defense to call for a full hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Committee members grilled Cresswell on a variety of topics including torture, presidential power, and the legality of the war in Iraq. Though his confirmation was doubtful, Cresswell ultimately won confirmation and appointment to the grade of Major General. Cresswell's major argument during his hearing in front of the senate was that \"the Law is blind. She is also an Independent. And she doesn't care if you get re-elected next year,\" and that the JAG position \"shouldn't be political.\""]}, {"page": "Box Case", "response": ["Case's 1927 record set the pattern for the next seven seasons. He missed a few matches in 1928, and his aggregate of runs fell to 685, but the average improved to 24.46; in 1929, he made 1000 runs in a season for the first time with 1035 runs, though the average fell back slightly to 21.56 and the highest score was only 77. There was a third century in 1930 \u2013 108 against Middlesex at Taunton \u2013 and he missed the 1000 runs in the season by only 15. In 1931, there were 1034 runs, and in the first three matches of the season, Case increased his highest first-class score twice. First, in the match against Hampshire at Taunton, he hit 131 with 12 fours. Then, against Surrey at The Oval, he came in at No 6 after four Somerset wickets had fallen for 35 runs, all of them to Edward Sheffield, and made 155 in 210 minutes."]}, {"page": "Sheffield (surname)", "response": ["* Edward Sheffield (1908\u20131971), English cricketer"]}]}}
