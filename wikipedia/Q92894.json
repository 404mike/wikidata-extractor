Since 2013, he has divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto. In 2017, he co-founded and became the Chief Scientific Advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto.With David Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams, Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks, although they were not the first to propose the approach. Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. They are sometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of AI\" and \"Godfathers of Deep Learning\", and have continued to give public talks together.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Artificial intelligence", "response": ["Interest in neural networks and \"connectionism\" was revived by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s."]}, {"page": "Bell Labs", "response": ["* 2018: Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio shared the Turing Award with Geoffrey Hinton for their work in Deep Learning.", "| ||style=\"background:#98FB98;\" | Yann LeCun || Recognized as a founding father of convolutional neural networks and for work on optical character recognition and computer vision.
