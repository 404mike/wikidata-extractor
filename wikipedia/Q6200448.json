It was here Casey began writing comedy for the BBC's Light Entertainment Department, submitting scripts to BBC Radio's North Region under the pen name Cass James (which was, at that time, his usual stage name). These were such a success that he would spend the next 26 years commuting between Crosby on Merseyside and BBC Broadcasting House in Manchester.", "A career in the law was not to be, though, and when he came out of the Army at the end of the war he tried to sort out his father's disastrous financial affairs.

So when his father moved into radio, James Casey ended up writing everything, including editions showcasing other comedians: for the radio series Northern Variety Parade, he wrote scripts not only for his father but also for popular comedians such as Norman Evans, for whom Casey wrote Over the Garden Wall style sketches.
