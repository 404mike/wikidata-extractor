He previously served as MP for Basildon from 1983 to 1997. He was a member of the Conservative Party.\nBorn and raised in Essex, Amess studied economics and government at Bournemouth University and then had short careers as a primary school teacher, underwriter and recruitment consultant.  He was elected as a Conservative councillor for Redbridge in 1982 and MP for Basildon in 1983. His position was seen as a bellwether seat, exemplifying the enthusiasm of the \"Essex man\" for the government of Margaret Thatcher. He held the seat in the election of 1992, but when boundary changes made it untenable, he became MP for Southend West in 1997 and served the constituency until his death.\nIn government, his highest position was as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Portillo for twelve years. He was more prominent as a backbencher, serving on many select committees and sponsoring several pieces of legislation, including the Protection Against Cruel Tethering Act (1988) and Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act (2000). The causes for which he campaigned included animal welfare, awarding city status to Southend-on-Sea, the honouring of Raoul Wallenberg and support for those suffering from endometriosis.\nA Roman Catholic who opposed abortion and same-sex marriage, his socially-conservative political views included support for the reintroduction of capital punishment. On the issue of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union (EU), he was in favour of leaving on grounds of parliamentary sovereignty and removing supremacy of EU law. He married in 1983, and had five children, including actress Katie Amess.\nOn 15 October 2021, Amess was stabbed multiple times while holding a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea. He died at the scene. A 25-year-old British citizen, Ali Harbi Ali, who is understood to have extremist Islamist beliefs, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and later detained under the Terrorism Act. On 21 October, he was charged with murder and preparing terrorist acts.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Morris (satirist)", "response": ["In 1997, the black humour which had featured in On the Hour and The Day Today became more prominent in Brass Eye, another spoof current affairs television documentary, shown on Channel 4. All three series satirised and exaggerated issues expected of news shows. The second episode of Brass Eye, for example, satirised drugs and the political rhetoric surrounding them. To help convey the satire, Morris invented a fictional drug by the name of \"cake\". In the episode, British celebrities and politicians describe the supposed symptoms in detail; David Amess mentioned the fictional drug at Parliament. In 2001, Morris' satirized the moral panic regarding pedophilia in the most controversial episode of Brass Eye, \"Paedogeddon\". Channel 4 apologised for the episode after receiving criticism from tabloids and around 3,000 complaints from viewers, which, at the time, was the most for an episode of British television.
