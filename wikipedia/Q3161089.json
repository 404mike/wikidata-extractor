When that ruling family moved from Milnrow to another of their homes following the Wars of the Roses, the local population was left without a place of worship and a chapel was constructed by the River Beal in 1496 to serve this community. This structure existed until the 1790s, when a \"poorly designed\" chapel was erected and consecrated; however, due to structural weaknesses, that church was demolished in 1814. Following an interim period when a \"plain building\" was used for worship, the present church building was built and consecrated by James Fraser, the Bishop of Manchester, on 21 August 1869.
