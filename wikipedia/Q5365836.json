For his father, the politician, see Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett (politician).\nEllis Ashmead-Bartlett  (11 February 1881 \u2013 4 May 1931) was an English war correspondent during the First World War.  Through his reporting of the Battle of Gallipoli, Ashmead-Bartlett was instrumental in the birth of the Anzac legend which still dominates military history in Australia and New Zealand.  Through his outspoken criticism of the conduct of the campaign, he was instrumental in bringing about the dismissal of the British commander-in-chief, Sir Ian Hamilton \u2013 an event that led to the evacuation of British forces from the Gallipoli peninsula.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gallipoli campaign", "response": ["After the failure of the August Offensive, the Gallipoli campaign drifted.

Discussing the situation with other journalists, he was befriended by the Daily Telegraph correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, who was deeply concerned that censorship was being used to suppress criticism of the Dardanelles campaign, which, as Murdoch had seen for himself, had serious problems. Murdoch agreed to carry a letter from Ashmead-Bartlett to the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith in London, written on 8 September, presenting his uncensored report of the situation. Hamilton quickly learned about the existence of this letter (another British reporter, Henry Nevinson, has been blamed for this but his biography points to an official Royal Navy war photographer).\"War, journalism and the shaping of the twentieth century: the life and times of Henry W. Nevinson\", par Angela V. John, page  Reaching France on his route to London, Murdoch was arrested by Military Police in Marseille and the letter was confiscated.

Churchill had anticipated losses and considered them a necessary tactical price. In June 1915, he discussed the campaign with the war correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, who had returned to London to deliver uncensored reports. Ashmead-Bartlett was incensed at the loss of ships and lives but Churchill responded that the ships were expendable.

A further general election was held in October 1924.

Although Gardner actually increased both his vote share and the number of votes he received, Ashmead-Bartlett emerged victorious with a majority of just under 2,000 votes. In 1926, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, the MP for Hammersmith North, resigned. In the resulting by-election, held against the background of the General Strike, Gardner regained the seat with the substantial majority of 3,611 votes over the Conservative's Samuel Gluckstein.
