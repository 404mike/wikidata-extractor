Giffard, who helped to collect the specimens. Because this Pritchardia from higher elevations differed from Pritchardia beccariana in its smaller habit and size of leaves, flower, fruit stalks and fruits, Rock urged Beccari to name and describe it as a new species. However, Beccari felt that the differences were probably due to the higher elevation where they grew. Thus, Beccari concluded that the differences were insufficient to erect a new species, although he did establish the variety giffardiana to honor Giffard and recognize its smaller stature."]}, {"page": "Lili\u02bbuokalani's Privy Council of State", "response": ["| scope=\"row\"|Walter M.
