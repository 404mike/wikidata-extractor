Irwin did not get on the pitch, but Liverpool won the game, and Irwin collected a winners medal.\nHe was not involved in the first-team squad at all in the 1978\u201379 season, but he made his debut early the following season, against West Bromwich Albion, and went on to make 14 appearances throughout the season.\n1980\u201381 saw a revamp of Liverpool's squad, with many young players given their chance, of which Irwin was one. Although not an automatic first-team selection, he made 30 appearances and was a regular squad member as Liverpool won the League Cup and European Cup.\nHowever, the summer of 1981 saw Liverpool sign Mark Lawrenson, which made Irwin surplus to requirements. As had several players released by Liverpool, Irwin moved on to Swansea, managed by John Toshack, for \u00a3340,000. This was the club's record transfer paid (although much of it was still owing when the club went bankrupt in 1984), until 2008 when they paid \u00a3400,000 for Ashley Williams. He was made captain, but suffered a knee injury in 1983 which forced him to retire.\nFollowing retirement, he served as a coach at Bolton Wanderers, under former teammate Phil Neal, from 1985 to 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["*Colin Irwin (footballer): Footballer, Liverpool F.C.."]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.
