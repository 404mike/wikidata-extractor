Spencer Tracy and Bergman briefly dated during the filming of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. She later had an affair with Gary Cooper while shooting For Whom The Bell Tolls. Cooper said, \"No one loved me more than Ingrid Bergman, but the day after filming concluded, I couldn't even get her on the phone.\" Jeanine Basinger, when reviewing 'Victor Fleming: An American Movie Master' by Michael Sragow writes, \"Fleming fell deeply in love with the irresistible Swede and never really got over it\". While directing his final film Joan of Arc, he was completely enthralled with Bergman. She had a brief affair with musician Larry Adler when she was travelling across Europe entertaining the troops in 1945. In Anthony Quinn's autobiography, he mentions his sexual relationship with Bergman, among his many other affairs. Howard Hughes was also quite taken by Bergman. They met through Cary Grant and Irene Selznick. He phoned one day to inform her that he had just bought RKO as a present for her.", "Bergman went to Alaska during World War II to entertain US Army troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to Europe for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. She arrived in Paris on 6 June 1945 with Jack Benny, Larry Adler and Martha Tilton where they stayed at The Ritz Hotel. Bergman's performance was rather limited; she couldn't sing, she couldn't play an instrument, she didn't have the humour of Jack Benny. In Kassel, she ran offstage in tears. When they went to see a concentration camp, she stayed behind. After the onset of World War II, Bergman felt guilt for her initial dismissal of the Nazi state in Germany. According to her biographer Charlotte Chandler, she had at first considered the Nazis only a \"temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.\" Bergman felt that \"the good people there would not permit it\". Chandler adds that she \"felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the Nazi extermination camps\"."]}, {"page": "McCarthyism", "response": ["* Larry Adler, musician"]}, {"page": "Top Hat", "response": ["For \"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\", probably Astaire's most celebratedHyam (2007), p.104: \"It epitomises the elegance and sophistication that are synonymous with his name.\" tap solo, the idea for the title song came from Astaire who described to Berlin a routine he had created for the 1930 Ziegfeld Broadway flop Smiles called \"Say, Young Man of Manhattan,\" in which he gunned down a chorus of men \u2013 which included a young Bob Hope and Larry Adler \u2013 with his cane.Astaire recounts how he got the idea at 4.00 a.m. and woke his sister Adele as he cavorted around his bedroom with an umbrella. After explaining to his awakened sister that he had just had an idea for the Manhattan number, she replied: \"Well, hang on to it, baby \u2014 you're going to need it in this turkey.\" cf. Astaire, p.184 Berlin duly produced the song from his trunk and the concept of the film was then built around it. In this number Astaire had to compromise on his one-take philosophy, as Sandrich acknowledged: \"We went to huge lengths to make the 'Top Hat' number look like one take, but actually it's several.\" Astaire's remarkable ability to change the tempo within a single dance phrase is extensively featured throughout this routine and taken to extremes \u2013 as when he explodes into activity from a pose of complete quiet and vice versa. This routine also marks Astaire's first use of a cane as a prop in one of his filmed dances.Mueller (1986), p.16: \"Trudy Wellman, a secretary who worked on Top Hat recalls: 'He gets very annoyed with himself, just himself....He would take that cane and he would break it across his knee, just like that, and, of course, we were all shocked because we knew we only had 13 canes....It was a good thing we had that 13th cane because that was the take we printed.'\" The number opens with a chorus strutting and lunging in front of a backdrop of a Parisian street scene. They make way for Astaire who strides confidently to the front of the stage and delivers the song, which features the famous line: \"I'm stepping out, my dear, to breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class,\" trading the occasional tap barrage with the chorus as he sings. The dance begins with Astaire and chorus moving in step. Astaire soon lashes out with a swirling tap step and the chorus responds timidly before leaving the stage in a sequence of overlapping, direction-shifting, hitch steps and walks. In the first part of the solo which follows, Astaire embarks on a circular tap movement, embellished with cane taps into which he mixes a series of unpredictable pauses. As the camera retreats the lights dim and, in the misterioso passage which follows, Astaire mimes a series of stances, ranging from overt friendliness, wariness, surprise to watchful readiness and jaunty confidence. Jimmy Cagney attended the shooting of this scene and advised Astaire, who claims to have ad-libbed much of this section.Astaire, p.210: \"Jimmy watched and whispered to me after about the third take, 'Don't shoot it again, kid \u2014 you got it on the second take. You'll never top that one.' I insisted on one more, but Jimmy was right. Next morning when I saw the rushes, that second take was the one.\" The chorus then returns in a threatening posture, and Astaire proceeds to dispatch them all, using an inventive series of actions miming the cane's use as a gun, a submachine gun, a rifle and, finally, a bow and arrow.This sequence was parodied in a scene in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein."]}, {"page": "The Spectator", "response": ["*Larry Adler, the world-famous mouth organist, wrote several articles for The Spectator in the 1970s during Harold Creighton's editorship."]}, {"page": "George Martin", "response": ["* \"The Man I Love\", Kate Bush & Larry Adler (18 July 1994, #27)", "* Larry Adler - The Glory of Gershwin (1994)"]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Original Score", "response": ["| Larry AdlerBlacklisted composer Larry Adler's name was removed from American prints of the British-made Genevieve.

He acknowledged Hector Berlioz as an influence, alongside Gustav Mahler, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and jazz. Several commentators have drawn a comparison with Jean Sibelius. Arnold's most significant works are generally considered to be his nine symphonies. He also wrote a number of concertos, including one for guitar for Julian Bream, one for cello for Julian Lloyd Webber, two for clarinet for Frederick Thurston and Benny Goodman, one for harmonica for Larry Adler and one \u2013 enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 Proms \u2013 for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick. His sets of dances \u2013 comprising two sets of English Dances (Opp. 27 and 33), along with one set each of Scottish Dances (Op. 59), Cornish Dances (Op. 91), Irish Dances (Op. 126), and Welsh Dances (Op. 138) \u2014 are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later wind and brass band arrangements. The English Dances also form the basis for Kenneth MacMillan's short ballet Solitaire, and one of them has been used as the theme music for the British television programme What the Papers Say (the Cornish Dances has provided the theme music for the television programmes of the cook Rick Stein). Arnold also wrote some highly successful concert overtures,Cooke, Mervyn (2005). Malcolm Arnold: Concert Overtures  (PDF). Chandos Records. Retrieved 2011-07-03. including Beckus the Dandipratt (an important stepping stone in his early career), the strikingly scored Tam o' Shanter (based on the famous Robert Burns poem), the rollicking A Grand Grand Overture (written for a Hoffnung Festival and featuring three vacuum cleaners and a floor polisher, all in turn polished off by a firing squad in a mock 1812 manner), and the dramatic Peterloo Overture (commissioned by the Trades Union Congress to commemorate the historic massacre of protesting workers in Manchester). Another popular short work is his Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for brass band. In 1954, Beckus the Dandipratt was given a radio studio performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski, who was thanked by the composer for his \"wonderful performance.\""]}, {"page": "Malcolm Sargent", "response": ["After his death Sargent was commemorated in a variety of ways.
