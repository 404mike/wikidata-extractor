He appears on their studio albums Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Starless and Bible Black, and a single track on Red. Cross also appears on numerous other live recordings from 1973 & 1974 that have been released by Robert Fripp's Discipline Global Mobile label in the decades since, including  USA (1975) and  The Night Watch (1997).\nAfter his time with King Crimson, Cross traveled extensively, eventually returning to music through work in the theatre. In 1987 he formed an ensemble called Low Flying Aircraft with Keith Tippett on piano. In 1988, he was invited by keyboardist Geoff Serle to join Radius, with whom he has recorded five studio albums.\nSince the late 1980's, he has toured and recorded with his own eponymous band (see below). Over a 30 year period, the group has included saxophonist Pete McPhail, guitarists Paul Clark and Peter Claridge, bassists Simon Murrell, John Dillon (who also sang lead vocals) and Mick Paul, drummers Dan Maurer, Lloyd, Craig Blundell, Steve Roberts and Pat Garvey, keyboardists Sheila Maloney and Alex Hall, and lead singers Arch Stanton and Jinian Wilde. Former (and current) King Crimson musicians John Wetton, Robert Fripp and Pat Mastelotto, as well as former Crimson lyricists Peter Sinfield and Richard Palmer-James have all contributed to David\u2019s albums.\nProminent session work includes recordings with Clearlight,  Jade Warrior and Tony Levin\u2019s  Stick Men (with whom Cross toured).\nRecently, Cross has released a series of duo recordings with Robert Fripp, Andrew Keeling, Andrew Booker (of No-Man),  David Jackson (formerly of Van der Graaf Generator) and Peter Banks (formerly of  Yes), the latter two including a full band.\nCross has composed music for theatre and worked as an actor as well. He runs his own record label, Noisy Records.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 23", "response": ["*  1949   \u2013 David Cross, English violinist "]}, {"page": "King Crimson", "response": ["The third major line-up of King Crimson was radically different from the previous two. Fripp's four new recruits were free-improvising percussionist Jamie Muir, drummer Bill Bruford (who left Yes at a commercial peak in their career in favour of the \"darker\" Crimson), bassist and vocalist John Wetton, and violinist, keyboardist and flautist David Cross, whom Fripp had met when he was invited to a rehearsal of Waves, a band Cross was working in. Most of the musical compositions were collaborations between Fripp and Wetton, who each composed segments independently and fitted together those which they found compatible. Event occurs at 4:34-13:48. With Sinfield gone, the band recruited Wetton's friend Richard Palmer-James (from the original Supertramp) as their new lyricist. Unlike Sinfield, Palmer-James played no part in artistic decisions, visual ideas, or sonic directions; his sole contributions to the group were his lyrics, sent via mail from his home in Germany. Following a period of rehearsals, King Crimson resumed touring on 13 October 1972 at the Zoom Club in Frankfurt, with the band's penchant for improvisation (and Muir's startling stage presence) gaining them renewed press attention.", "*David Cross \u2013 violin, viola, keyboards "]}, {"page": "Robert Fripp", "response": ["In 1971, Fripp ousted Sinfield and took over de facto leadership of King Crimson (although he has always formally rejected the label, preferring to describe his role as \"quality control\" or \"a kind of glue\"). From this point onwards, Fripp would be the only constant member of the band, which in turn would be defined primarily by his compositional and conceptual ideas (which drew on avant-garde jazz and improvisation mixed with a variety of hard rock and European influences, in particular the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k). With avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir, violinist David Cross, singing bass player John Wetton and former Yes drummer Bill Bruford now in the ranks, King Crimson produced three more albums of innovative and increasingly experimental rock, shedding members as they progressed: beginning with Larks' Tongues in Aspic, progressing with Starless and Bible Black and culminating in the benchmark avant-power trio album Red. Fripp formally disbanded the group in 1974, in what eventually turned out to be merely the first in a regular series of long hiatuses and further transformations.", "* 2015 : Starless Starlight : David Cross & Robert Fripp"]}, {"page": "Yes (band)", "response": ["* 2020: Crossover by David Cross & Peter Banks, with Banks, Kaye, Downes, Sherwood, O Wakeman"]}, {"page": "Pat Mastelotto", "response": ["|Stick Men feat.

They were aware of Pinder's contributions to the Moody Blues and did not want to sound similar, but concluded there was no other way of generating the orchestral sound. The instrument was originally played by Ian McDonald, and subsequently by Robert Fripp on McDonald's departure. Later member David Cross recalled he did not particularly want to play the Mellotron, but felt that it was simply what he needed to do as a member of the band. Tony Banks bought a Mellotron from Fripp in 1971, which he claimed was previously used by King Crimson, to use with Genesis. He decided to approach the instrument in a different way to a typical orchestra, using block chords, and later stated that he used it in the same manner as a synth pad on later albums. His unaccompanied introduction to \"Watcher of the Skies\" on the album Foxtrot (1972), played on a Mk II with combined strings and brass, became significant enough that Streetly Electronics provided a \"Watcher Mix\" sound with the M4000. Banks claims to still have a Mellotron in storage, but does not feel inclined to use it as he generally prefers to use up-to-date technology. Barclay James Harvest's Woolly Wolstenholme bought an M300 primarily to use for string sounds, and continued to play the instrument live into the 2000s as part of a reformed band."]}, {"page": "Gong (band)", "response": ["In August, Pierre Moerlen was persuaded to return, replacing the unhappy and alcoholic Davison, and the band now also added Mireille Bauer on percussion, Jorge Pinchevsky on violin and Patrice Lemoine on synthesizer and, for the first time in Gong, keyboards. They toured the UK in November 1975, as documented on the 2005 release Live in Sherwood Forest '75, and worked on material for their next album, Shamal. Hillage, however, was increasingly uncomfortable without Allen, and with now being seen as the band's de facto leader. With a solo career beckoning, he and Giraudy decided to leave before Shamal was completed, participating in it only as guests. Howlett took over as lead male vocalist and Sandy Colley, Lemoine's partner and the band's cook, became his female counterpart. The album was released in February 1976 and they toured in support until a crisis was precipitated in May when Pinchevsky was refused entry to the U.K. for carrying marijuana. Ex-King Crimson violinist David Cross was tried out as a possible replacement, but before any progress could be made with this new line-up, the band split into two camps: Howlett wanted to keep vocals, but Moerlen and Bauer wanted the music to be entirely instrumental, with Malherbe undecided. Virgin Records executive Simon Draper chose Moerlen's way and Howlett left, quickly followed by Lemoine and Colley."]}, {"page": "Wishbone Ash", "response": ["In 2001, Mark Birch was replaced by Finnish guitarist Ben Granfelt.

Ben Granfelt left the band in 2004 to continue working on his solo career. Granfelt's mentor, Muddy Manninen joined the band. In late 2006, the band released a new studio album entitled Clan Destiny. In 2007, longtime drummer Ray Weston left the band, stating that he was tired of constant touring and wanted to concentrate on different things.

Fripp reached an agreement with EG management that they would tell Cross, \"on proviso that [Cross] was told that I objected to not telling him personally.\" Despite reaching this agreement, Cross would not be told by EG until the day before the recording of Red began.

At the time, the piece consisted only of the vocal section of the song, and Wetton claims that it got a \"cold reception\" from both Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford. Later, an introductory theme was written by Robert Fripp and performed on violin by David Cross, and two additional sections were added after the vocal, one being contributed by Bruford.

The lyrics went through several iterations, with one early verse later included by Wetton in \"Caesar's Palace Blues,\" a song he would perform with U.K. Since the title \"Starless and Bible Black\" was already used for an improvisation on the group's previous album, the song's title was shortened to \"Starless\".
