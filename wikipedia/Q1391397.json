His studies are conducted in the Galton Laboratory. He is also a television presenter and a prize-winning author on the subject of biology, especially evolution. He is a popular contemporary writer on evolution. In 1996 his work won him the Michael Faraday Prize \"for his numerous, wide ranging contributions to the public understanding of science in areas such as human evolution and variation, race, sex, inherited disease and genetic manipulation through his many broadcasts on radio and television, his lectures, popular science books, and his once-regular science column in The Daily Telegraph and contributions to other newspaper media\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Human evolution", "response": ["* Human Evolution, BBC Radio 4 discussion with Steve Jones, Fred Spoor & Margaret Clegg (In Our Time, February 16, 2006)"]}, {"page": "The Third Culture", "response": ["* geneticist Steve Jones"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Steve Jones (born 1977), presenter", "*Steve Jones (born 1944), biologist, geneticist, author and television presenter", "*Steve Jones (born 1955), Commonwealth Games silver medallist and former marathon world record holder"]}, {"page": "Biological determinism", "response": ["Sociobiology emerged with E. O. Wilson\u2019s 1975 book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The existence of a putative altruism gene has been debated; the evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton proposed \"genes underlying altruism\" in 1964, while the biologist Graham J. Thompson and colleagues identified the genes OXTR, CD38, COMT, DRD4, DRD5, IGF2, GABRB2 as candidates \u201caffecting altruism\u201d. The geneticist Steve Jones argues that altruistic behaviour like \"loving our neighbour\" is built into the human genome, with the proviso that neighbour means member of \"our tribe\", someone who shares many genes with the altruist, and that the behaviour can thus be explained by kin selection. Evolutionary biologists such as Jones have argued that genes that did not lead to selfish behaviour would die out compared to genes that did, because the selfish genes would favour themselves. However, the mathematician George Constable and colleagues have argued that altruism can be an evolutionarily stable strategy, making organisms better able to survive random catastrophes."]}, {"page": "Jean-Baptiste Lamarck", "response": ["* Lamarck and Natural Selection, BBC Radio 4 discussion with Sandy Knapp, Steve Jones and Simon Conway Morris (In Our Time, 26 December 2003)"]}, {"page": "Steve Jones", "response": ["*Steve Jones (musician) (born 1955), English rock and roll guitarist and singer, member of the Sex Pistols", "*Steve Jones, musician (The Unforgiven) and television producer", "*Steve Jones (American football) (born 1951), American football player", "*Steve Jones (runner) (born 1955), Welsh athlete", "*Steve Jones (baseball) (born 1941), American baseball pitcher", "*Steve Jones (cricketer) (born 1949), Australian cricketer", "*Steve Jones (cyclist) (born 1957), British cyclist", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born 1955), English footballer", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born 1957), English footballer", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born 1960), English footballer", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born 1962), Welsh footballer", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born 1964), Welsh footballer", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born March 1970), English footballer", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born December 1970), English footballer", "*Steve Jones (footballer, born 1976), Northern Irish international footballer", "*Steve Jones (golfer) (born 1958), American golfer", "*Steve Jones (rugby league), rugby league footballer who played in the 2000s", "*Steve Jones (rugby union, born 1951) (1951\u20132007), Welsh rugby union player", "*Steve Jones (rugby union, born 1977), Welsh rugby union player", "*Steve Jones (rugby union, born 1983), English rugby union player", "*Steve Jones, alias used in Wales in the 1980s of professional wrestler William Regal", "*Steve Jones (biologist) (born 1944), Welsh geneticist ", "*Steve Jones (aviator) (born 1960), British pilot", "*Steve Jones (Welsh presenter) (born 1977), Welsh television presenter", "*Steve Jones (English presenter) (born 1945), English musician, disk jockey, television presenter, and voice-over artist"]}, {"page": "HarperCollins", "response": ["* The Language of the Genes, Steve Jones (1993)"]}, {"page": "National Secular Society", "response": ["*Professor Steve Jones"]}, {"page": "Keswick, Cumbria", "response": ["Annual events in the town's calendar include the Keswick Film Festival (February\u2013March).
