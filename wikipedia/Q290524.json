Physician and author Eric Cassell, widely cited on the subject of attending to the suffering person as a primary goal of medicine, has defined suffering as \"the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of the person\".Eric J Cassell, The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine, 2004.  Cassell writes: \"The obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back to antiquity. Despite this fact, little attention is explicitly given to the problem of suffering in medical education, research or practice.\" Mirroring the traditional body and mind dichotomy that underlies its teaching and practice, medicine strongly distinguishes pain from suffering, and most attention goes to the treatment of pain. Nevertheless, physical pain itself still lacks adequate attention from the medical community, according to numerous reports.See for instance the National Pain Care Policy Act of 2007  Besides, some medical fields like palliative care, pain management (or pain medicine), oncology, or psychiatry, do somewhat address suffering 'as such'. In palliative care, for instance, pioneer Cicely Saunders created the concept of 'total pain' ('total suffering' say now the textbooks),See Existential pain\u00a0\u2013 an entity, a provocation, or a challenge? in Journal of Pain Symptom and Management, Volume 27, Issue 3, pp. 241\u2013250 (March 2004) which encompasses the whole set of physical and mental distress, discomfort, symptoms, problems, or needs that a patient may experience hurtfully."]}, {"page": "Palliative care", "response": ["The field of palliative care grew out of the hospice movement, which is commonly associated with Dame Cicely Saunders, who founded St. Christopher's Hospice for the terminally ill in 1967, and Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross who published her seminal work \"On Death and Dying\" in 1969. In 1974, Balfour Mount, a urologist familiar with Saunders and K\u00fcbler-Ross's work, coined the term \"palliative care\" and created the first palliative care ward at the Royal-Victoria Hospital in Montreal. At almost the same time, Dr. Paul Henteleff became the director of a new \"terminal care\" unit at St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg. In 1987, Declan Walsh established a palliative medicine service at the Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center in Ohio which later expanded to become the training site of the first palliative care clinical and research fellowship as well as the first acute pain and palliative care inpatient unit in the United States. The program evolved into The Harry R. Horvitz Center for Palliative Medicine which was designated as an international demonstration project by the World Health Organization and accredited by the European Society for Medical Oncology as an Integrated Center of Oncology and Palliative Care.", "In the 1960s, hospice pioneer Cicely Saunders first introduced the term \"total pain\" to describe the heterogenous nature of pain.  This is the idea that a patient's experience of total pain has distinctive roots in the physical, psychological, social and spiritual realm but that they are all still closely linked to one another. Identifying the cause of pain can help guide care for some patients, and impact their quality of life overall."]}, {"page": "Templeton Prize", "response": ["| Cicely Saunders"]}, {"page": "List of members of the Order of Merit", "response": ["| 156. ||  || || Dame Cicely Saunders || 30 November 1989 || 22 June 1918 \u2013 14 July 2005 || Nurse, Social Worker"]}, {"page": "James Naughtie", "response": ["Throughout June, July and August 2012, and in early September 2012, he presented The New Elizabethans on Radio Four, a programme about notable people under the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.
