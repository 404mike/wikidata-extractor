Several factors have been reasoned for the collapse, including heavy rainfall the previous night and the large crowd stamping and swaying as the match progressed. One theory in a report following the event centred around Scottish player Bobby Templeton. Regarded as an exciting attacking player, Templeton was making his debut for the Scottish national team and had gained possession of the ball moments prior to the collapse. The investigation stated that the crowd's desperation to see Templeton dribble with the ball caused them to surge forward, which may have contributed to the collapse. It was also noted that the bottom ten rows of the stand had been left vacant as people had filled the racing track surrounding the pitch. This blocked the view from these rows and resulted in the spectators on the lower rows to continually press upwards to avoid being pushed into the empty rows below them and lose their vantage points."]}, {"page": "1880 in Scotland", "response": ["* 29 March \u2013 Bobby Templeton, footballer (died 1919)"]}, {"page": "Bobby Templeton (footballer born 1880)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bobby Templeton (footballer, born 1880)"]}, {"page": "1900\u201301 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*  Bobby Templeton, 20 appearances"]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*  Bobby Templeton, 26 appearances"]}, {"page": "1902\u201303 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*  Bobby Templeton, 11 appearances"]}]}}
