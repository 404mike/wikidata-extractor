He was loaned out to Hereford United, before signing with Southend United in 2003. In 2005, he moved to Port Vale via Bristol Rovers and Walsall. After two seasons with Vale he joined Macclesfield Town. There he was loaned out to Telford United, before he finished his career with Oxford United in 2008. He served as an Elite Commando in the Royal Marines. He accepted a call-up from the Saint Lucia national team in September 2012, and returned to club football with Redditch United in December 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Levi Reid", "response": ["Joining Stafford Rangers, his strike in the Conference North play-off final penalty shootout booked Rangers a place in the Conference National for the 2006\u201307 season. Rangers struggled to adapt to their new division in 2006\u201307, though Reid was a regular in the latter half of the season. Reid made his return to the English Football League in 2007\u201308, joining Macclesfield Town on trial, who were managed by his former teammate Ian Brightwell. He impressed at the season's start and was offered a four-month deal. Enjoying regular football for the League Two club, he signed an end-of-season deal in December. In August 2008 he joined Oxford United on trial, alongside former Macclesfield teammate Michael Husbands. Reid was given a six-month contract with Oxford, but left late in September 2008 to help care for his sick baby back in Stafford."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season started with fourteen points from seven games to launch the club's promotion bid. After three defeats the Vale then entered a long period of inconsistent form. In September, Darrell Clarke joined on loan from Hartlepool United, though he would play just the one game for the club. Gary Mulligan also arrived on loan from Sheffield United, and would find greater success in Burslem. The next month Foyle added to the squad by signing Michael Husbands from Walsall. In November, Sam Togwell joined on loan from Scunthorpe United, in an initial six week deal that was extended until the end of the season. Another long-term loan deal was struck with Leyton Orient for big defender Clayton Fortune, who would later turn down a permanent transfer to Vale Park after failing to agree on personal terms. Foyle also made possibly the best signing of his spell in charge at Vale, bringing striker Leon Constantine in from Torquay United for a \u00a320,000 fee. However Foyle lost two big players, when key defender Sam Collins and promising striker Billy Paynter were sold to Hull City for \u00a365,000 and \u00a3150,000 respectively, the pair leaving on loan deals until the January transfer window (when they would leave permanently). Four straight defeats followed this, emphasising the effect the sales had on the club's promotion bid. In January, Bell moved on to Cheltenham Town, and Hector Sam joined Walsall. In came Jason Talbot on loan from Mansfield Town, who joined the club permanently at the end of the season. Foyle also signed defender Mark McGregor from Blackpool, and midfielder Sean Doherty from ADO Den Haag. A sequence of two points in five games killed off the Vale's promotion hopes by April.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||30||align=\"left\"| Michael Husbands", "|4||FW|| Saint Lucia||30||Michael Husbands||4||1||0||0||5", "| October 2005 || FW ||  || Michael Husbands || Walsall || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the season a number of players were released: Nathan Lowndes (Chester City); George Abbey (Crewe Alexandra); Rhys Weston (Walsall); Michael Husbands (Macclesfield Town); Christian Smith (Clyde); Ross Gardner (Ilkeston Town); Malvin Kamara (Huddersfield Town); Michael Walsh and Mark Soboljew.
