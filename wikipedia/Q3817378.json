Israel proclaimed its independence on 14 May 1948, after the end of the British Mandate, and immediately applied for membership in the United Nations. In a vote by the UN Security Council on Israel\u2019s membership on 17 December 1948, the United Kingdom abstained in the vote. A vote on a renewed application took place on 4 March 1949, in UNSC Resolution 69, in which the UK again abstained, avoiding a veto that a negative vote would have meant, and on 11 May 1949 the UK also abstained in the UN General Assembly for UNGA Resolution 273. However, the UK recognised Israel de facto on 13 May 1949,Abraham Mayer Heller, Israel's odyssey: a survey of Israel's renaissance, achievements, and problems, Farrar, Straus and Cudahy, 1959, p.83 and de jure on 28 April 1950. Sir Alexander Knox Helm was the first British Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires in Israel, whose rank was later raised to Minister, serving from 1949 to 1951. He was succeeded in 1951 by Francis Evans, whose rank was raised to Ambassador in 1952.
