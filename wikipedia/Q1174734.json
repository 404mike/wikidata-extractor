Arsenal's conserved performance was attributed to their upcoming European Cup match, something Graham categorically denied: \"I'm not even thinking about next Wednesday.\" Arsenal drew away to Oldham Athletic and then Sheffield Wednesday, extending a winless run of five games in all competitions. The team beat Tottenham on 1 December 1991 to go fourth in the league table, 10 points behind the leaders.
