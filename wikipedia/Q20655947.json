He made his first appearance for the club's youth team on 27 May 1995, coming on as a substitute for Terry Cooke in a 10\u20130 friendly win over FC Meilen, in which he played alongside future Manchester United first team players David Beckham and Phil Neville. The following season, he made seven appearances for the club's Junior B team, and on 4 April 1996, he scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 away win over Everton B. On 8 July 1996, he signed his first trainee contract with Manchester United, and became a regular in the B side for the 1996\u201397 season. He made a total of 21 appearances during the season, culminating with being named on the bench for the 1997 Lancashire Youth Cup final against Blackburn Rovers.After a lengthy conversion process over the previous two seasons, Ryan was considered a defender by the start of the 1997\u201398 season. He divided his time between the Junior A and B teams that season, as well as making his first appearance for the reserve team. Despite now playing in defence, he scored the most goals of his career in 1997\u201398, hitting the net twice for the Junior B side in the league and once in the Lancashire Youth Cup semi-final defeat to Tranmere Rovers. At the end of the season, he was rewarded with a professional contract. The 1998\u201399 season saw the Junior A and B teams replaced by a single Under-19 age group side, for whom Ryan scored twice in 11 appearances; he also played twice for the reserve team. However, with no first-team prospects on the horizon, he was granted a free transfer to Wrexham on 24 March 1999.He made seven appearances for Wrexham in August and September 1999, but he failed to hold onto a place in the team and he was released at the end of the 1999\u20132000 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Ryan", "response": ["Michael or Mike Ryan may refer to:", "* Mike Ryan (musician) (born 1988), country music artist from Texas", "* Mike Ryan (footballer, born 1930) (1930\u20132006), English footballer for Lincoln City and York City", "* Mike Ryan (soccer coach) (1935\u20132012), Irish-American soccer coach", "* Mike Ryan (footballer, born 1979), English footballer for Wrexham", "* Mike Ryan (third baseman) (1868\u20131935), American baseball player", "* Mike Ryan (catcher) (1941\u20132020), American baseball player", "* Mike Ryan (athlete) (born 1941), former New Zealand marathon and long-distance runner"]}, {"page": "Mike Ryan (footballer born 1979)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Ryan (footballer, born 1979)"]}, {"page": "Michael Stuart Ryan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Ryan (footballer, born 1979)"]}]}}
