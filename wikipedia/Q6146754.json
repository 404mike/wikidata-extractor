In 2009, a \"12th man fund\" was set up by a group of supporters in order to provide additional transfer funds to the club. As a result, the number 12 shirt was retired at the start of the 2009\u201310 season (though it was reintroduced in 2018\u201319).

Westley's first game as manager of Rushden was a 1\u20130 victory away at Cambridge United on 26 December 2006. Westley signed several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley, younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non-League Paper. The newly assembled team won five consecutive games in the league, including victories away at the top two teams in the league at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn in the form of the club, Westley was sacked after a 2\u20132 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two-and-a-half months, and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. Westley managed Rushden for thirteen games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three.

A 2\u20130 win over Ebbsfleet United maintained Oxford's lead at the top of the Conference.

A crowd of over 10,000 saw United win 2\u20130, despite a missed Constable penalty in the third minute. Youngster Sam Deering was loaned out to Conference South team Newport County for one month to regain full fitness after breaking his leg last year.

On 16 September, it was announced that the 68 clubs playing in the Conference would each receive a share of \u00a31,000,000 from the Premier League. A 4\u20130 win against Eastbourne Borough sent United eight points clear at the top of the table, before they fell to their first defeat of the season, away at Mansfield Town.
