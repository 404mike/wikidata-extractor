He was predominantly used as an inside-right, but could also play at inside-left if required. In a career spanning 17 years, he played for a number of Football League teams, in addition to spells in the Southern Football League with Gillingham and Norwich City.

Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top scorer in 1921\u201322 with 16 league goals, remained along with Clement Rigg, Sid Hoad and Bob Lilley. Scottish defenders John Steel and James Price also continued to play for Nelson. Among those who left the club were Harold Andrews, who joined Bury,Dykes, p. 17 and Irish international inside forward Billy Halligan, who retired from professional football. Goalkeepers Harry Heyes and Robert Bruce both moved on in the close season, so Stockport County custodian Joseph Birds was signed as a replacement in June 1922.Dykes, p. 20 In an attempt to improve the attacking prowess at the club, Wilson signed experienced inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme on a free transfer from Darlington in May 1922,Dykes, p. 73 and Scottish forward Mike McCulloch arrived from Heart of Midlothian for a transfer fee of \u00a3150.Dykes, p. 51 Wilson also added to the defensive ranks with the signings of his former Oldham Athletic team-mate Ernie Braidwood, and of Jimmy Broadhead on a free transfer from Scunthorpe & Lindsey United.Dykes, p. 22", "| Arthur Wolstenholme", "October began with a 1\u20133 defeat away at Ashington, although new signing Arthur Wolstenholme scored his first goal of the campaign, and Nelson's first ever league goal against the Northumberland club. A 2\u20130 win in the return match with goals from Eddleston and McCulloch took Nelson to the top of the league for the first time in the season the following week, overtaking Wigan Borough at the summit. The month ended with a pair of wins over Tranmere Rovers; the first a 2\u20130 win on 21 October, and the second a 1\u20130 success a week later thanks to John Black's first goal in a Nelson jersey. The team failed to score for only the second time in the season in the 0\u20131 away defeat to Barrow on 4 November. Despite conceding at Seedhill for the first time in the campaign, Nelson atoned for the loss seven days later with a 2\u20131 victory as a result of strikes from Eddleston and Wolstenholme. Nelson did not play another league match for two weeks, when they faced Rochdale at home. A first Nelson goal for defender Ernie Braidwood could not prevent the side succumbing to a 1\u20132 reverse, not helped by first-team regulars Wilson and Wolstenholme missing the match due to injury, forcing inexperienced inside-right William Bennett to make his league debut.Dykes, p. 19", "David Wilson used a total of 19 players during the 1922\u201323 season and there were nine different goalscorers.  The team played in a 2\u20133\u20135 formation (the standard formation at the time) throughout the campaign, with two fullbacks, three halfbacks, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre forward. Both Ernie Braidwood and Bob Hutchinson played in every league and cup game, while Nelson's record appearance holder Clement Rigg missed just one match, the defeat to Ashington on 7 October.

On Christmas Day, half-back Ambrose Harris made his first appearance for Nelson as the side beat Chesterfield 1\u20130 thanks to Bill Ellerington's first goal for the club.

For their first match, played on 29 November 1924, the team was drawn to play Winsford United of the Cheshire County League at Seedhill. Nelson won the first ever meeting between the two clubs 4\u20131 with goals from Braidwood, Eddleston, O'Beirne and Wolstenholme, to progress to the Sixth Qualifying Round for the first time in three years. In the next round Nelson were again given a home tie, against Second Division outfit Coventry City, who would be relegated to the Third Division North at the end of the 1924\u201325 campaign. Nelson made only one change from the side that had defeated Winsford, with Eddie Cameron replacing Arthur Wolstenholme. In front of a crowd of 7,000 spectators, one of the highest attendances at Seedhill of the season, Coventry won 1\u20130 to progress to the first round proper of the competition.Dykes (2009), p. 78", "|align=\"left\"|Arthur Wolstenholme"]}, {"page": "Michael Dowling (footballer)", "response": ["After one season in the North-Eastern League, Dowling returned to the Football League with Lincoln City.

Tommy Moran scored twice and created two other goals, one for Ron Harbertson, as Darlington eliminated Chelsea, League champions only three seasons earlier, in the fourth round of the 1957\u201358 FA Cup to progress to the last 16 of the competition for only the second time in their history. Gary Coatsworth scored the goal that confirmed Darlington as winners of the 1989\u201390 Football Conference title.

Healey was no longer a first choice in the forward line, but appeared not infrequently, particularly when the ground was heavy. He made his first appearance on 24 December and played in nine of the next twelve fixtures. Replacing the injured Arthur Wolstenholme for the FA Cup match against Manchester City, he opened the scoring with a header, but City won 3\u20131. He kept his place for the next match, and even after Wolstenholme's return to fitness continued in the team, with a winning goal against Rochdale, four of Darlington's six to beat Hartlepools United in the Durham Senior Cup, and profiting from a defensive error to score the only goal of the league visit to Tranmere Rovers. Healey was retained for the 1922\u201323 season, and he scored against Accrington Stanley in September, but he played mainly in the reserves. In a match against Hartlepools' reserves in November, he was the butt of the crowd's mockery because he had, as the Northern Daily Mail put it, \"now lost some of his former vigour\". He finished his Football League career with 5 goals from 21 matches."]}, {"page": "Aaron Travis (footballer)", "response": ["In 1920\u201321, Darlington again reached the first round proper of the FA Cup, and again took their Football League opponents to a replay. Travis came into the team at inside right against Blackpool and scored, but Darlington went out 2\u20131. In the league, they went one better than the previous season, won their second North-Eastern League title, and were elected to the newly formed Northern Section of the Third Division. Travis was not a regular in the Football League side. He played eleven matches and scored six goals, five of which came over the Christmas and New Year period: both goals of a 2\u20130 win at Lincoln City, one of five against Walsall, and two of five against Ashington. Press rumours suggesting that Travis and Arthur Wolstenholme had been offered in exchange for a Hartlepools United player were partly denied: the Darlington club secretary insisted that Wolstenholme was unavailable \"to Hartlepools or any other club\". Travis played occasionally at the end of the season, and had to take over in goal at Southport Central in April when Andy Greig broke his arm. He returned home at the end of the season, and played local football for Hurst Albion and Ashton PSI."]}]}}
