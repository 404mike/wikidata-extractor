She did not attend her son's coronation in 1911 since it was not customary for a crowned queen to attend the coronation of another king or queen, but otherwise continued the public side of her life, devoting time to her charitable causes. One such cause was Alexandra Rose Day, where artificial roses made by people with disabilities were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers.Duff, pp. 251\u2013257, 260.The Alexandra Rose Day fund still exists; its patron is Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy, Alexandra's great-granddaughter. During the First World War, the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain's highest order of knighthood, the Order of the Garter, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, came under criticism, as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain. Alexandra joined calls to \"have down those hateful German banners\".Alexandra to King George V, quoted in Battiscombe, p. 285. Driven by public opinion, but against his own wishes, the king had the banners removed; but to Alexandra's dismay, he had taken down not only \"those vile Prussian banners\" but also those of her Hessian relations who were, in her opinion, \"simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor's orders\". On 17 September 1916, she was at Sandringham during a Zeppelin air raid,Battiscombe, pp. 291\u2013292. but far worse was to befall other members of her family.
