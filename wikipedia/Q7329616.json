After the publication of his book Wodehouse at Work in 1961 he became regarded as the leading authority on the works of P. G. Wodehouse. He published or contributed to nine more books on the subject. He adapted eight Wodehouse novels and several other of the author's works for broadcast on BBC radio between 1979 and 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "P. G. Wodehouse", "response": ["At the age of twelve in 1894, to his great joy, Wodehouse was able to follow his brother Armine to Dulwich College.McCrum, p. 24 He was entirely at home there; Donaldson comments that Dulwich gave him, for the first time, \"some continuity and a stable and ordered life\". He loved the camaraderie, distinguished himself at cricket, rugby and boxing, and was a good, if not consistently diligent, student.Jasen, p. 17 The headmaster at the time was A. H. Gilkes, a respected classicist, who was a strong influence on Wodehouse. In a study of Wodehouse's works, Richard Usborne argues that \"only a writer who was himself a scholar and had had his face ground into Latin and Greek (especially Thucydides) as a boy\" could sustain the complex sequences of subordinate clauses sometimes found in Wodehouse's comic prose.Usborne, p. 26"]}, {"page": "Jeeves", "response": ["The development of Jeeves and Bertie was influenced by Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, according to Richard Usborne; Sherlock Holmes and Jeeves are \"the great brains\" while Dr. Watson and Bertie are \"the awed companion-narrators, bungling things if they try to solve the problems themselves\".Usborne (2003), Plum Sauce: A P G Wodehouse Companion, pp. 58\u201359. Jeeves and Bertie have been described as comic versions of Holmes and Watson. Wodehouse directly compares Jeeves and Bertie to Holmes and Watson in some of the Jeeves stories, such as in Aunts Aren't Gentlemen.Thompson (1992), pp. 112\u2013114.", "Jeeves has an encyclopedic knowledge of literature and academic subjects. He frequently quotes from Shakespeare and the romantic poets. Well informed about members of the British aristocracy thanks to the club book of the Junior Ganymede Club, he also seems to have a considerable number of useful connections among various servants. Jeeves uses his knowledge and connections to solve problems inconspicuously.Cawthorne (2013), p. 173. Richard Usborne, a leading scholar of the life and works of Wodehouse, describes Jeeves as a \"godlike prime mover\" and \"master brain who is found to have engineered the apparent coincidence or coincidences\".Wodehouse at Work to the End, Richard Usborne 1976. To form his plans, Jeeves often studies \"the psychology of the individual\" or the personality of one or more people involved in the situation.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 98. Jeeves says that studying \"the psychology of the individual\" is essential to solving problems, and that this means studying \"the natures and dispositions of the principals in the matter\". His mental prowess is attributed to eating fish, according to Bertie Wooster, who credits the phosphorus content in the fish with boosting Jeeves's brain power. Jeeves does not try to argue this claim, though at least once he says he does not eat a lot of fish.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 137."]}, {"page": "Aunt Agatha", "response": ["The character of Aunt Agatha was inspired by Wodehouse's aunt Mary Bathurst Deane, his mother's older sister. In a 1955 a letter to his biographer Richard Usborne, Wodehouse wrote \"Aunt Agatha is definitely my Aunt Mary, who was the scourge of my childhood.\" According to Richard Usborne, \"His Aunt Mary (Deane) harried and harassed him a good deal, and blossomed later into Bertie's Aunt Agatha. Aunt Mary honestly considered that her harrying and harassing of the young Pelham was for his good; and she may have been right.\"Richard Usborne,  Wodehouse at work to the end (1976), p. 43"]}, {"page": "Bertie Wooster", "response": ["Bertie Wooster has many relatives who appear or are mentioned in the stories. Three other possible relatives (Cuthbert and Julia Mannering-Phipps and their son Gussie) appear or are mentioned in \"Extricating Young Gussie\", though in this story Bertie's surname appears to be Mannering-Phipps. It is not shown in later stories if the three relatives are renamed Wooster. In his book Who's Who in Wodehouse, Daniel Garrison suggests that the protagonist of \"Extricating Young Gussie\", Bertie Mannering-Phipps, is a prototype of the later Bertie Wooster.Garrison (1991), p. 111. Richard Usborne writes that Bertie Wooster does appear in \"Extricating Young Gussie\" though his last name is Mannering-Phipps in the story.Usborne (2003), p. 73. In the book Wodehouse in Woostershire, it is suggested that Bertie's grandmother was married twice, first to a Mannering-Phipps and then to a Wooster with the title Lord Yaxley.Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 161\u2013163, 275\u2013276. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the Mannering-Phipps family, they are listed with asterisks below."]}, {"page": "Dornford Yates", "response": ["In 1948 Richard Usborne wrote an article entitled Ladies and Gentlemen v. Cads and Rotters about the works of Dornford Yates in Volume 3, Number 11 of The Windmill, a literary magazine. Yates was not pleased by the article, but nevertheless Usborne went on to write Clubland Heroes (1953; reprinted 1974 and 1983) in which he examined the work of Yates and two contemporary thriller writers, John Buchan and Sapper.", "In 1983 Sharpe wrote an introduction to a reprint of Yates' first Chandos thriller Blind Corner, one of a series issued by J.M.Dent & Sons under the title Classic Thrillers. Further Yates' books in the series were Perishable Goods, with an introduction by Richard Usborne; Blood Royal, with an introduction by A.J.Smithers; Fire Below; She Fell Among Thieves, with an introduction by Ion Trewin; Gale Warning; Cost Price; Red in the Morning; An Eye For a Tooth; and The Best of Berry, with an introduction by Jack Adrian."]}, {"page": "Blandings Castle", "response": ["* In 1977, Richard Usborne included in his appendix to the unfinished Sunset at Blandings a report by Michael Cobb. Based on train journeys and travel times described in the stories, Cobb argues that Buildwas or Much Wenlock fit the description of Market Blandings best, which places Blandings Castle in their immediate surroundings. Parenthetically, he also asks \"Could anyone have considered that Blandings Castle was really Apley Park?\" Apley Park (or Hall) is less than  from Buildwas.", "Wodehouse worked on Sunset at Blandings until his death, writing even in his hospital bed. It was unfinished and untitled when he died, and was subsequently edited (by Richard Usborne) and released in its incomplete form with extensive notes on the content."]}, {"page": "Oldest Member (character)", "response": ["It is assumed in multiple Wodehouse reference works that there is only one character referred to as the Oldest Member.See Who's Who in Wodehouse (1991) by Daniel H. Garrison (page 134), Plum Sauce: A P. G. Wodehouse Companion (2003) by Richard Usborne (page 118), and The P.G. Wodehouse Miscellany (2015) by N. T. P. Murphy (page 61). However, because of the discrepancies between the stories, J. H. C. Morris suggested in his book Thank You, Wodehouse that there are at least three characters with that title: one who attended Oxford, another who went to Cambridge (and one of these resides at Marvis Bay while the other does not), and an American one. Morris also considered the possibility that the Oldest Member is Mr. Mulliner, but dismissed this idea for multiple reasons: Mr Mulliner is rarely directly involved in his stories while the Oldest Member is more frequently part of his own stories, Mr Mulliner appears to rely on cues more than the Oldest Member does, and Mulliner's stories are more incredible than those of the Oldest Member."]}, {"page": "Right Ho, Jeeves", "response": ["The book is dedicated to Raymond Needham KC, \"with affection and admiration\". Needham had represented Wodehouse in a tax dispute case and won the case. According to Wodehouse scholar Richard Usborne, Needham had to talk Wodehouse out of using the original, more provocative dedication: \"To Raymond Needham KC, who put the tax-gatherers to flight when they had their feet on my neck and their hands in my wallet\" or words to that effect. Wodehouse actually befriended the tax inspector involved in the case.", "* Richard Usborne, in his book Plum Sauce: A P. G. Wodehouse Companion (2003), states that \"the prize-giving is a riot, probably the best-sustained and most anthologised two chapters of Wodehouse\"."]}, {"page": "Bulldog Drummond", "response": ["The first four books deal with Drummond against Carl Peterson, who becomes Drummond's arch-enemy. Peterson is also a master of disguise and uses several aliases. Peterson is killed in the fourth book, The Final Count, although Fairlie brings him back for his final novel, The Return of the Black Gang. Drummond forms a grudging respect for Peterson, and offers an honourable duel to the death at the end of The Third Round, instead of the usual summary justice that normally befalls members of Peterson's gang. The writer Richard Usborne sees the mass-murdering terrorist Peterson as \"quite a sympathetic character. Almost, in fact, a hero\", and wrote that \"authors\u00a0... fall in love with their big villains\u00a0... Sapper came to love Carl Peterson dearly, and so did Drummond\"."]}, {"page": "H. C. McNeile", "response": ["McNeile's early works, the war stories published before 1919, are either \"plot-driven adventure narrative[s]\", such as the short stories \"The Song of the Bayonet\" and \"Private Meyrick, Company Idiot\", or \"atmospheric vignette[s]\", such as \"The Land of Topsy Turvy\" and \"The Human Touch\". McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work. The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having \"little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clich\u00e9d and often repetitive\"; Richard Usborne agreed, adding that the female characters were \"cardboard\" and that McNeile was \"wonderfully forgetful\" about characters dead in one book and alive in the next. In  the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies  the central character  as \"a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama\". The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique, credible or well-rounded, his books \"make no claim to literary excellence\", and are instead, \"good, solid thrillers\". Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told. Meyer classifies the non-war stories as middlebrow, with \"sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England\". His early novels, particularly Bull-Dog Drummond and The Black Gang, were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories. The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile's lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile \"mastered the tricks of his trade\".", "From the 1950s on, McNeile's work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War, and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were \"carrying the F\u00fchrer-principle\". DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel\u2014The Black Gang (1922)\u2014is when the fascist element was introduced. Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War, while the academic Ion Trewin considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as \"simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen\"."]}, {"page": "Ethel M. Dell", "response": ["P. G. Wodehouse refers to her in several of his stories. Some have opined that Wodehouse's character, Rosie M. Banks, is based on Dell; however, Wodehouse himself told his biographer Richard Usborne that Rosie is based on Ruby M. Ayres."]}, {"page": "Sebastian Beach", "response": ["He is somewhat more emotional than Wodehouse's other famous domestic servant, Jeeves, although, when in the company of his masters, Beach generally limits himself to a slightly raised eyebrow, even when strongly moved. According to Richard Usborne, Beach is a hypochondriac in Something Fresh and complains about corns, an ingrowing toenail, swollen joints, nervous headaches, and the lining of his stomach. However, this is not the case in the later books."]}, {"page": "Galahad Threepwood", "response": ["In the two Blandings novels after Summer Lightning in which he does not play a part, his shoes are ably filled by his fellow-Pelican Uncle Fred (Lord Ickenham). In fact, it has been said that Ickenham lays down the pattern that Galahad follows. Uncle Fred's first appearance in a Blandings novel is Uncle Fred in the Springtime (1939), in which he arrives at the castle under an assumed name, bringing several other impostors with him. In the next Blandings novel, Full Moon (1947), critic Richard Usborne points out that \"in patches Gally, [the novel's] real hero, acts and talks more like Lord Ickenham than himself. 'Spreading sweetness and light' is Lord Ickenham's specific role, but here, Wodehouse, seeming to forget, applies these words to Gally.\" Critic J. H. C. Morris agrees, \"Gally becomes more and more like Lord Ickenham as the Blandings Saga progresses. In the later stories there is no one like him for telling the tale.\""]}, {"page": "Plum Pie", "response": ["\"Life with Freddie\" is the longest story in Plum Pie. It may be considered long enough to be a novella, though it is categorised as a short story. In the first UK edition of Plum Pie, \"Life with Freddie\" is 67 pages long, while the next longest story, \"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\", is 45 pages long. According to Wodehouse scholar Richard Usborne, the length and course of \"Life with Freddie\" suggest that it may have been planned to be made into a full novel."]}, {"page": "Rosie M. Banks", "response": ["The character was inspired by the prolific early twentieth-century romance novelist Ruby M. Ayres. Wodehouse intentionally chose the name \"Rosie M. Banks\" to be similar to hers, stating in a 1955 letter to his biographer Richard Usborne that he \"wanted a name that would give a Ruby M. Ayres suggestion\". Another possible influence is the female novelist Ethel M. Dell (dell/banks = features of countryside scenery), who also has a middle initial of \u2019M\u2019, a reputation for writing novels of the Rosie M. Banks sort, and is mentioned by name in several Wodehouse stories."]}, {"page": "William Tell Told Again", "response": ["Regarding the book in the context of Wodehouse's works, Evelyn Waugh wrote in 1961, \"Collectors prize as bibliographical rarities such early works as William Tell Told Again and Swoop, but it is impossible to discern in them any promise of what was to come.\" However, Barry Phelps, in his book P. G. Wodehouse: Man and Myth (1992), held a different view of both William Tell Told Again and The Swoop!: \"Both books are early Wodehouse, writing rapidly for cash rather than art, giving them an exuberant, uninhibited freshness. He clearly enjoyed writing them and they are a marker for what is to come.\" In his 2003 book Plum Sauce: A P. G. Wodehouse Companion, Richard Usborne described William Tell Told Again: \"A short, cheerful narrative by Wodehouse, excellent colour pictures by Philip Dadd and excellent verse captions to the pictures, by John W. Houghton \u2013\u00a0very much the sort of expert verse Wodehouse himself was already writing, in Punch and elsewhere.\""]}, {"page": "The Man with Two Left Feet", "response": ["It is a miscellaneous collection and includes several stories that are more serious than Wodehouse's more well-known comic fiction.
