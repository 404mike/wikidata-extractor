Serving from 1836 to 1855, based at Port Adelaide, Lipson also superintended many of the initial maritime surveys of that new colony.\nHe was born in Dartmouth, England. In 1793, at the age of 9 or 10, joined the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer on Windsor Castle under Captain Sir Thomas Byard. In 1797, he served under Byard on Bedford, at the Battle of Camperdown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Port Lincoln", "response": ["After assessing a number of other potential locations, Light was ordered by England to consider Port Lincoln as a possible site for the capital.  While Thomas Lipson had arrived in Port Lincoln earlier and approved of its 'beautiful harbour' and 'fertile land', Light was unconvinced from the beginning as he faced fierce westerly gales, ill-placed islands and rocky reefs on arrival."]}, {"page": "Charles Kingston", "response": ["Kingston's mother died in 1851 at the age of 27, after which he and his siblings were probably raised by servants as their father was heavily involved in business and political activities.

At an early age he was sent to the Adelaide Educational Institution run by John Lorenzo Young, where he regularly won awards and had a talent for mathematics. His schoolmate Joseph Verco later recalled him as \"distinctly rough in manner and rather disposed to bully those younger and smaller than himself [...] very disposed to mischief, practical and horse-play\".

It  had such poor conditions that for many years it was also known as \"Port Misery\", later becoming known as the Old Port. In 1837 a harbour was declared when harbourmaster Captain Thomas Lipson took up residence on the shore of the then named port creek with the first migrants landing in the same year, onto the river bank lined with mangroves, until a canal was cut through them to a higher location in the sand dunes.

After an illness which affected his lungs, he was advised to move to a warmer climate. While in Portsmouth he met Captain Thomas Lipson, who was fitting out the \"Buffalo\" for its pioneering voyage to South Australia. This new colony captured his imagination. He read Robert Torrens's book The Colonization of South Australia and met with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and some members of the South Australian Company and was so convinced of the colony's future that he sold up his considerable business interests and purchased three 134-acre sections with their three accompanying town acres.
