Serving from 1836 to 1855, based at Port Adelaide, Lipson also superintended many of the initial maritime surveys of that new colony.\nHe was born in Dartmouth, England. In 1793, at the age of 9 or 10, joined the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer on Windsor Castle under Captain Sir Thomas Byard. In 1797, he served under Byard on Bedford, at the Battle of Camperdown.", "link_mentions": {}}}
