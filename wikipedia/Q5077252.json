He put his faith into practice by establishing it as a place where boys with a boarding need could be educated and prepared for life. In the early days the school was a virtually self-sufficient community. It had a farm, a wide range of workshops, a school building, a chapel, a sanatorium and various boarding houses. Young ensured that every Kingham boy learned their \u2018letters\u2019, gained a trade and could understand the Christian faith. On leaving they could progress to accommodation and opportunities in London or emigrate to a farm Young owned in Canada and make their life in the New World. The Kingham Hill Trust, established by Young, administers the school and its sister foundation, Oak Hill Theological College in London."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: Y", "response": ["|Charles Young"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Young"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Charles Young; MP for Christchurch (1885\u20131892)"]}, {"page": "Charles Young", "response": ["Charles Young may refer to:", "*Charles Young (American football) (c. 1867\u20131908), American college football coach at the University of Missouri", "*Charles Young (Australian footballer) (1905\u20131980), Australian footballer", "*Charles Young (cricketer) (1852\u20131913), English cricketer", "*Charles Young (governor) (1812\u2013?), colonial administrator for Prince Edward Island", "*Charles Young (musician) (1686\u20131758), English organist and composer", "*Charles Young (officer of arms) (1795\u20131869), English heraldic officer", "*Charles Young (United States Army) (1864\u20131922), African American colonel", "*Charles Young, 7th Baronet (1839\u20131887), English barrister", "*Charles Young Jr. (born 1962), member of the Mississippi House of Representatives", "*Charles Young (Conservative politician) (1850\u20131928), English educationalist and Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "Charles Edward Baring Young", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Young (Conservative politician)"]}]}}
