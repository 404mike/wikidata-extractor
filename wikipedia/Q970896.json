Since the start of the 2013\u201314 season, Vlaar continued to be in the first team, forming a centre\u2013back partnership with either Clark, Nathan Baker and Jores Okore. He then contributed to helping the club keep three clean sheets out of the four league matches throughout November. Manager Lambert praised Vlaar's performance and believed that he's should be included in the FIFA World Cup squad. In a match against Southampton on 4 December 2013, Vlaar suffered a calf injury and was substituted at half time, as the club won 3\u20132. After missing five matches, he returned to the starting line\u2013up against Sunderland on 1 January 2014, only to be suffer an injury and was substituted in the 70th minute. After missing only match, Vlaar returned to the starting line\u2013up against Arsenal on 13 January 2014, as Aston Villa lost 2\u20131.

After being on the sidelines for ten days with the injury, Vlaar returned to the starting line\u2013up against Cardiff CIty on 11 February 2014 and helped the club keep a clean sheet, in a 0\u20130 draw. After the match, manager Lambert said: \"I think there might be a chance. I\u2019ll have to see how he feels. You cannot risk it. He's got to feel himself if he can play and if he's comfortable and thinks he can play then you have to look at it. Ron being out is a bitter blow.\" Following this, he regained his first team place, playing in the centre\u2013back position for the rest of the 2013\u201314 season and helped Aston Villa avoid relegation once again by finishing fifteenth place. At the end of the 2013\u201314 season, Vlaar went on to make thirty\u2013four appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "1991 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 23 April \u2013 Nathan Baker, Professional Footballer"]}, {"page": "Tommy Elphick", "response": ["Ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, Elphick was appointed as the club's new captain.

Elphick made his Aston Villa debut (as well as captain), in the opening game of the season, in a 1\u20130 loss against Sheffield Wednesday. He then scored an own goal, in a 1\u20131 draw against Newcastle United on 24 September 2016. He quickly established himself in the first team for the first two months until he suffered an injury in mid-October. After returning from injury, Elphick continued to regain his place in the first team until he was dropped from the first team by new Manager Steve Bruce in mid-December. Because of this, he was among several players up for sale in the winter transfer window, in order to reduce the wage bills. Although the move never happened, he remained on the substitute bench for the rest of the season, as Bruce preferred the central-defensive partnership of Nathan Baker and James Chester, who also took his place as the captain as well, and mostly came on as a late substitute.
