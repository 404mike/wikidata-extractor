In 1999, he was the first UK performer ever voted \"Best Male Artist\" by the readers of Britain's Blues & Soul magazine. His debut album, Medicine 4 My Pain, as well as the singles \"Do I Qualify\" and \"Sexy Cinderella\", had an instant appeal to soul fans in the UK and elsewhere, but it was not until his work got remixed that he got his major breakthrough. In October 2003, Hall was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma; he died on 14 February 2006, at the age of 31, from complications resulting from the stem cell transplant he received in January 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 14", "response": ["*2006 \u2013 Lynden David Hall, English singer-songwriter and producer (b. 1974)"]}, {"page": "List of soul musicians", "response": ["*Lynden David Hall"]}, {"page": "Artful Dodger (duo)", "response": ["* Lynden David Hall - \"Forgive Me\""]}, {"page": "Courtney Pine", "response": ["* \"Lady Day (& John Coltrane)\" (2000) \u2013 Courtney Pine featuring Lynden David Hall"]}, {"page": "MOBO Awards", "response": ["* Best Newcomer: Lynden David Hall"]}, {"page": "Rahzel", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|Lynden David Hall"]}, {"page": "Trevor Nelson", "response": ["He went on to work in A&R for record labels Cooltempo and EMI, promoting artistes such as D'Angelo, Mica Paris and Lynden David Hall; while also promoting events, including \"The Lick\".", "As a pioneer in the urban music scene, Nelson started his broadcasting career as \"Madhatter\" in 1985 on London's Kiss FM, originally a pirate radio station, and after it gained a licence in 1990.
