A renowned knight who fought on the French side during the early years of the Hundred Years\u2019 War, Charny wrote a semi-autobiographical poem The Book of Geoffroi de Charny and a set of questions on chivalric matters for the short-lived Company of the Star, France\u2019s counterpart to England\u2019s Order of the Garter.  Although a prose treatise called the Book of Chivalry has also long been accredited to himRichard W. Kaeuper & Elspeth Kennedy, The Book of Chivalry of Geoffroi de Charny: Text, Context, and Translation. Middle Ages Series. (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania U.P, 1996). recent findings indicate this to have been more likely by his son of the same name, Geoffroi II de Charny, who died in 1398.Ian Wilson, The Book of Geoffroi de Charny, with the Livre Charny edited and translated by Nigel Bryant, (Woodbridge, The Boydell Press, 2021). Charny is also widely associated with the first known showings of the Shroud of Turin, though there are now doubts that he was responsible for these.   He took part in a successful crusading expedition to Smyrna in 1344 and shortly after his return from this King Philip VI appointed him a royal councillor and bearer of the Oriflamme, the sacred battle-standard of France.  This r\u00f4le, one in which he continued under King Jean II, made its holder an automatic target for enemy forces on a battlefield, and it was thus that he met his heroic end during the closing moments of the battle of Poitiers on September 19, 1356. Geoffroi de Charny was one of Europe's most admired knights during his lifetime, with a widespread reputation for his skill at arms and his honour. The Tournai-based abbot-chronicler Gilles le Muisit wrote of him: \u2018a vigorous soldier, expert in weaponry and much renowned both overseas and here. He has taken part in many wars and in many mortal conflicts, in all of them conducting himself with probity and with nobility\u2019.Gilles le Muisit Chronique et annales de Gilles le Muisit, abb\u00e9 de Saint-Martin de Tournai (1272-1352), ed.
