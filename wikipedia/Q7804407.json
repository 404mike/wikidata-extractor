Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, Hal Douglas, Mark Elliott, John Leader, Corey Burton, George DelHoyo, Peter Cullen, Morgan Freeman, Ashton Smith, Jim Cummings, John Garry, Tom Kane, Nick Schatzki, Ben Patrick Johnson, Tony Rodgers, Alistair Lewis, Beau Weaver, and Brian Cummings. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s included Dick Wesson (for Disney), Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM), Tim Turner (for Pinewood Studios / Rank Organisation), and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clich\u00e9s such as \"Colossal!\", \"Stupendous!\", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clich\u00e9s for satirical effect.

Because Beatty's Canadian accent in The Invisible Man pilot was considered too harsh, \"Secret Experiment\" featured the softer accent of fellow Canadian actor Lee Patterson.
