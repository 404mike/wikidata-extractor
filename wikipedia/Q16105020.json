The protests, which led to a reversal of the ban, saw no official UVF involvement although Wright, despite not being a member of the Orange Order, was personally involved and led a sizeable force of his men to Drumcree. Wright and the Mid-Ulster Brigade attracted considerable attention from the global media as they made a formidable show of strength and staunchly defended the Orangemen's right to march their traditional route. The brigade manned the barricades, and brought homemade weapons to the church; among these was a mechanical digger and a petrol tanker.McKay, Susan. (2000). Northern Protestants: an unsettled people. Retrieved 29 September 2011 There was intelligence that Wright and his unit had planned to attack the British Army and police who were blocking the Orangemen's passage.
