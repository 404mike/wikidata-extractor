Michael Quinn has suggested that early church leaders had a more tolerant view of homosexuality given that during the 19th century, the Church (like American society as a whole) was relatively tolerant of same-sex intimate relationships. However, at the time, many such relationships had no sexual component, and among those that did, the evidence is usually circumstantial. Quinn also states that several active and prominent members of the church in Utah were not disciplined after publicizing that they were living in romantic relationships with their same-sex domestic partners, although there is no clear evidence these relationships involved sex. These included Evan Stephens, who had been director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir until 1916 and is the author of numerous standard church hymns, who remained single but had intimate relationships and shared the same bed with a series of male domestic partners and traveling companions. Some of these relationships were described under a pseudonym in The Children's Friend. Also notable were Louise B. Felt and May Anderson, the church's first two general presidents of the Primary, who lived together in the same bedroom for decades and were referred to by Primary leaders as the \"David and Jonathan\" of Primary. Quinn's interpretations of previous leaders' views and the nature of the relationships of Evan Stephens, and Felt and Anderson have been challenged as a distortion of history. Kimball Young has cited the early church's practice of sealing men to each other as evidence of latent homosexuality."]}, {"page": "Anthony C.
