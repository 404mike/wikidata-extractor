He ran the world's fastest mile in 1906, and competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.Born in Stockton on Tees, Butterfield came in second in his semifinal heat in the 800 metres with a time of 1:58.9.  His finish, while behind \u00d6d\u00f6n Bodor's, was ahead of defending champion James Lightbody's. Butterfield did not advance to the final.He also competed in the 1500 metres, placing third in his initial semifinal heat and not advancing to the final. Butterfield's time was 4:11.8; Mel Sheppard had set a new Olympic record at 4:05.0 in winning the heat and eliminating Butterfield and the other five runners.\nButterfield was killed in action during the First World War, serving as a private with the Royal Garrison Artillery. He was buried in the Birr Cross Roads Cemetery.His obituary in the Northern Despatch recorded that he had once raced against a greyhound. The dog came second.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mel Sheppard", "response": ["The 1908 Olympics were the first true championships for the 1500 metres, as the previous Olympics were not well attended by the top milers of the day. However, the heats for the final were capricious in their format: only the winner of each of the eight heats would qualify for the final, and there was no seeding to ensure that top runners were separated in their heats. Accordingly, top runners like 1904 and 1906 Olympic champion James Lightbody, John Halstead, second-fastest in history in the event and three-time AAA champion George Butterfield all failed to advance."]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres", "response": ["This was the fourth appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. The only runner from 1904 to return was the champion, Jim Lightbody. Unlike the previous two Games, the field included some top runners in 1908. Harold A.
