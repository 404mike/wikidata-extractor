The first version was formed when Guy LeBlanc, Donald Prince and Mark Sp\u00e9nard, who had played together in the band Delerium, recruited Dan Lacasse.  It is said that during one night in early 1982, while the band was on an excursion in the Gatineau National Park, the name took on its final form and the seed was planted.", "In 2004 production seemed pretty much on schedule; however, Don Prince contacted LeBlanc and quit the band due to other musical commitments, and is replaced by Luc Poulin for about 2 days.  Since the original agreement for this project was that each band member create his own parts for the song (to be different this time), and that the deadline for submission to the label was getting very close, Guy LeBlanc borrowed a bass guitar, taught himself to play it, wrote the bass part and recorded it in 2 weeks time (thereby making the deadline).

Also in the works, is another possible DVD, with the documentary focus on behind the scenes at FMPM 2007 and at Exodus recording sessions.  They plan on eventually making a follow-up Exodus: Now, taking the exodus concept to the present day.
