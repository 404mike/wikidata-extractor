The English National Football Archive state that Tom Allin died in 1945. The BMD database for England & Wales records an Tom Allin passing away in 1945 in Devon but he was aged 79, too young for a man born in April 1862. Assuming that the footballer Allin was born in Boston, Lincolnshire in 1862 then there is no record of his death in England & Wales according to BMD database.", "link_mentions": {}}}
