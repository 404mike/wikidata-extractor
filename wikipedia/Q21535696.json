He and his family arrived in New South Wales in 1807, his father being an officer of the New South Wales Corps. Married Francis Ann, (c.1833) daughter of Lieutenant Samuel North, pastoralist and Police Magistrate for Windsor. Bell Sr was commissioned as a Justice of the Peace in 1842 and was an appointed member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1832 to 1837.

He also explored the Hunter River and saved the explorers Howe and Singleton from starvation. As a reward, he was given a grant of  at Patrick's Plains, naming his estate 'Corinda'. He specialized in breeding horses for coaching and hackney horses. He was granted  on the Hunter River near Belford in 1839. He had other estates in the Hunter Valley and moved from Corinda to Milgarra at Bunnan near Scone in 1849. In 1859 he bought Pickering at Denman, an  freehold estate on the Hunter River. He lived there until his death on 9 August 1883.", "Archibald Bell, Jr. who also gave his name to Mount Bell, Bell Range, the town of Bell and Bell's Line of Road. The reason for this enthusiastic desire to enshrine Bell's name in just about everything is because, in 1823, Archibald Bell, Jr, when he was only nineteen, crossed the mountains along what was to become Bell's Line of Road. This was not a solitary achievement. Sensibly he used the knowledge of the local Aborigines (Darug people) who had been crossing the mountains for tens of thousands of years. Although the mountains had been crossed at Katoomba a decade earlier, there was still no satisfactory route through the mountains from Richmond at this time. Bell reached Mount Tomah on his first attempt but could not find a way across the mountains. On his second attempt he followed the ridge across to the present site of Bell and from there made his way down into Hartley Vale where he joined up with Cox's road.", "In his diary Archibald Bell recalls that, upon his return to Sydney, he reported the richness of the soil in the Bilpin area (which inevitably led to the arrival of settlers eager to grow fruit trees in the area) and the rainforest and huge tree ferns around Mount Tomah."]}, {"page": "Archibald Bell", "response": ["Archibald Bell may refer to:", "* Archibald Bell (writer) (1776\u20131854), Scottish writer", "* Archibald Bell Sr. (1773\u20131837), Australian politician", "* Archibald Bell Jr. (1804\u20131883), Australian politician and writer", "* Archibald Bell (cricketer) (1868\u20131948), Guyanese cricketer"]}, {"page": "Archibald Bell, Sr.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archibald Bell Sr."]}, {"page": "Thomas Arndell", "response": ["The Rum Rebellion started in 1808, which resulted in Bligh being overthrown.
