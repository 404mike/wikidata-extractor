He is head of the Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems group and co-director of the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics (CCNR). Husbands is also one of the founders of the field of evolutionary robotics.His research interests are in long-term investigations of artificial evolution of nervous systems for robots, with emphasis on:\n\nvisually guided robots acting in the real world\ntheoretical and practical development of advanced evolutionary algorithms for hard engineering and design optimisation problems\ndevelopment of biologically inspired artificial neural networks incorporating diffusible modulators\ncomputational neuroscience\ncomputer manipulation of sound and image\nhistory and philosophy of AI\nmachine learning.Husbands has edited several books, including coediting The Mechanical Mind in History (MIT Press; 2008; ISBN 978-0-262-25638-4) as well as author of numerous scientific articles. With neuroscientist Michael O'Shea he introduced the idea of GasNets \u2013  artificial neural networks that use diffusing virtual gases as modulators. These are inspired by nitric oxide (NO) volume signalling in real brains. The Sussex team has also done pioneering work on detailed computational modelling of nitric oxide diffusion in the nervous system.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evolutionary robotics", "response": ["In the early 1990s, two separate European groups demonstrated different approaches to the evolution of robot control systems.
