This interest led  to his winning, at age 16, a Queen's Scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) after which he worked for several years in repertory theatre around England until he became, in his mid-twenties, one Granada Television's directors during Coronation Street's earliest years.  Over the succeeding decades he accumulated a very large body of work as a director, producer-director or executive producer, much at Yorkshire Television, in such programmes as 1962's Before My Time, 1965's The Man in Room 17, the 1969 and 1970 programmes, Great Performances, Ryan International and Dr. Finlay's Casebook, 1971's Kate, 1972's The Onedin Line, 1973's Warship, 1974's Fall of Eagles and Good Girl, 1975's The Main Chance, 1976's Hadleigh, Forget Me Not and Dickens of London, 1977's Raffles and Beryl's Lot, 1979's Flambards and The Sandbaggers, 1981's The Good Companions and Get Lost!, 1982's Airline and ITV Playhouse, 1984's Sorrell and Son and Killer, 1985's The Beiderbecke Affair, 1986's Love and Marriage, 1989's A Bit of a Do, 1995's Oliver's Travels, 2001's Victoria & Albert, 2006's The Shell Seekers and many others.Several of the TV series and other productions which David Cunliffe directed or produced were also broadcast in the United States.  The Onedin Line achieved considerable popularity when it was broadcast by stations of the non-commercial PBS network.  Two years after its original showing, Fall of Eagles was transmitted on cable/satellite station TBS and, in 1990, was shown on another cable/satellite station, Bravo which, at the time, was operating as a high-quality, non-commercial outlet devoted to the arts.  One of the productions on which he worked, The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank, a 1988 Telecom Entertainment/Yorkshire Television film, shown by CBS, won a Primetime Emmy Award for its writer, William Hanley, as well as a number of nominations for other achievements, including acting, directing and producing, with David Cunliffe receiving a nomination as co-executive producer...one of the nine executives who were nominated for overseeing the production.     \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ruffian on the Stair", "response": ["In 1973, ITV Sunday Night Theatre broadcast a production of the play directed by David Cunliffe, starring Judy Cornwell as Joyce, Michael Bryant as Mike, and Billy Hamon as Wilson."]}, {"page": "The Lotus Eaters (TV series)", "response": ["| colspan=2                  | David Cunliffe", "| colspan=2                  | David Cunliffe ", "| colspan=2                  | David Cunliffe "]}, {"page": "Wilde Alliance", "response": ["*Executive Producer - David Cunliffe"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["*David Cunliffe (Acting Diploma 1953)"]}, {"page": "The Potting Shed", "response": ["A 1981 television production of the play was written by Pat Sandys and produced by Yorkshire Television for the London Weekend Television series Celebrity Playhouse.

In 1978, Plater was commissioned by David Cunliffe, an executive producer at Yorkshire Television (YTV), to adapt the J. B. Priestley novel The Good Companions for television. Following this, Cunliffe commissioned Alan Plater to write four episodes of what Plater called a \"non-violent thriller\".Pixley, Viewing Notes, p.4. Using characters inspired by Nick and Nora Charles, the detectives in the film The Thin Man (1934) and its sequels, Plater sought to juxtapose the conventions of the hardboiled thriller, as expounded by the likes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, with the mundanity of life in Yorkshire.Pixley, Viewing Notes, p.5. Originally to be called \"Lost And Found\", the scripts were written in late 1979 and early 1980 and the result was Get Lost!, a four-part serial starring Alun Armstrong and Bridget Turner that was broadcast in June and July 1981.", "Shortly after the completion of The Beiderbecke Affair, David Cunliffe asked Plater to write a new serial with the same characters. At this point Plater decided to create a jazz-themed trilogy; The Beiderbecke Affair would be followed by The Gillespie Tapes and The Yardbird Suite, referencing Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker respectively. However, YTV felt that they wanted to stick with the Beiderbecke \"brand\" and so the first sequel was renamed The Beiderbecke Tapes. Plater intended The Beiderbecke Tapes to be another six-part serial set in Yorkshire, the Netherlands and Athens. As well as Trevor and Jill, returning characters would include Big Al, Little Norm, Hobson (now an officer in British Intelligence), Mr Carter and the Headmaster. When financial problems at YTV delayed production, Plater reworked his scripts as a novel, also titled The Beiderbecke Tapes. YTV later decided that they would film the novel as a two-part serial, each episode of ninety minutes duration. To fit the shorter length, Big Al, Little Norm and Hobson were dropped from the script. Financial constraints meant that the action originally intended for Athens had to be relocated to Edinburgh, an event which became an in-joke when it was worked into the script as a planned trip to Greece being changed at the last minute for the trip to Scotland.", "One major change to the production team was that David Cunliffe had by this stage moved on from YTV. He was replaced by Keith Richardson, best known as the producer of the thriller serial Harry's Game (1982). The Beiderbecke Connection was broadcast in four parts in November and December 1988 and averaged 8.8 million viewers over its run."]}, {"page": "Barbara Angell", "response": ["Following the Australian tour with Madge Ryan for J.C.
