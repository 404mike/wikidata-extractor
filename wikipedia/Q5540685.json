He made 49 appearances in all senior competitions, including 17 in Small Heath's last season in the Football Alliance and 31 in their first two seasons in the Football League. In 1894, Hollis's amateur status was reinstated and he joined Bournbrook F.C., retiring from the game in 1897.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Hollis", "response": ["George Hollis VC (October 1833 \u2013 16 May 1879) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.", "In 1994 a man watching racehorses being trained on the Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland, glimpsed a small piece of metal being thrown up with mud by a horse galloping by; this turned out to be a Victoria Cross (minus its bar). It was presumed to have been one of the four awarded to the 8th Hussars, as they were based at the Curragh between 1869 and 1875. Until 1881 soldiers were required to wear all their medals while on duty and it was believed that a member of the Hussars could have lost the medal while training on horseback on the Curragh. It was thought likely that the medal belonged to either George Hollis or John Pearson as the other two medals were accounted for; however Pearson's VC subsequently turned up in auction at 2004, along with his other medals.Niall Fallon, 'A rare medal is unearthed on Curragh' in The Irish Times, 21 May 1994, p. 22http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/nostalgia/victoria-cross-daredevil-who-helped-crush-indian-mutiny-1-4053316"]}, {"page": "Charles Partridge (footballer)", "response": ["Partridge was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire.

Six goals came in each half, three from Mobley, three by Walton, whose third was the culmination of a \"brilliant run\", and two each from the other three forwards, Hallam, Wheldon and Hands. The goalscoring continued on Christmas Eve with a 6\u20130 victory at Northwich Victoria, and a 3\u20131 home win against Crewe Alexandra which meant Small Heath would begin the new year at the top of the table.

The half-backs were again the backbone of the team, and Wheldon, who produced \"a brilliant exposition of dodging and shooting\", scored the winning goal five minutes from time in what the Standard's reporter described as a \"rattling good game\". Fred Speller was reported to have \"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken last year\" in a Boxing Day friendly with top amateur club Marlow, the club from which he signed for Small Heath. Their last League match of 1893, a comfortable 6\u20130 victory against Lincoln City, took them into the new year in second place in the division, three points ahead of Notts County but two points behind Liverpool, who had played two fewer matches. Pumfrey strengthened the defence, George Hollis was as usual secure in goal, and the forwards, with the returning Mobley and the introduction of reserve-team player Walter Jackson, \"showed better combination and greater dash than they have recently done\".", "Midland League club Loughborough hosted Small Heath in the first round of the Birmingham Senior Cup. In heavy rain, the scores were level until ten minutes from time, when goalkeeper George Hollis was barged into the goal before he could get to a shot from distance. The ball followed him over the line, and despite the obstruction on the goalkeeper, the referee awarded Loughborough a goal. Small Heath threw men forward in search of an equaliser, which left them ill-protected in defence, and they conceded twice more. In the FA Cup, Small Heath were drawn at home to Bolton Wanderers, who were so keen to have the match played on their own ground that they offered Small Heath the total gate receipts up to \u00a3150 and a half share of receipts above that figure, with a minimum guarantee of \u00a360, to agree to a change of venue. The offer was declined. Bolton were predicted to lose, but they did not. With the wind behind them, Small Heath took a two-goal half-time lead, but in the second half, Hollis, who had \"not given a worse display in goal all season\", made numerous mistakes, gifted the visitors two goals, and the final score was 4\u20133 to the First Division side."]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["All the regular first-choice players signed on again for the new campaign, apart from goalkeeper George Hollis.

After the interval, Hallam scored after Wilkes' shot was parried, then Wilkes himself made the final score 3\u20131.The Alliance. Small Heath v. Burton. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 7 September 1891. Despite playing into the sun, Birmingham St George's took a first-half lead, increased early in the second half. Small Heath's shooting was poor throughout, but Walter Brown eventually scored with a header from Tommy Hands' cross, and on the stroke of time, Hands himself secured a \"lucky draw\".Notes on Sport and The Alliance.
