He played once for the England national team and was bought and sold for millions of pounds in the domestic transfer market. However, his career was dogged with injuries, limiting his appearances.\nStarting his career with Port Vale in 1998, within two years he earned an \u00a3855,000 move to Tottenham Hotspur. He spent eight years at the Premier League club, making 142 appearances in all competitions. In 2008. he spent time on loan at both Everton and Hull City, before signing permanently with the latter that summer for \u00a32.5 million. He spent the 2010\u201311 season on loan at Crystal Palace, before joining the club permanently the next season.

This was followed in mid-week by the equalising goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Steaua Bucharest in the UEFA Cup First round.

Woodgate was called up for the Euro 2004 qualifiers against Slovakia and Macedonia in October 2002; he started and played the whole 90 minutes in both games. Injuries blighted Woodgate over the next couple of years, but he did manage to win his fifth cap in a friendly against Sweden on 31 March 2004. He started in the 1\u20130 defeat at Ullevi in Gothenburg, and was replaced by Anthony Gardner at half-time.

As the season progressed he released Marcus Bent, and sold Carl Griffiths back to Leyton Orient for \u00a3100,000. He further sold highly rated young centre-back Anthony Gardner to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a31 million, and sold Tony Butler to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a3140,000.

Two weeks later, on 1 October, on the club's 125th anniversary, Kaboul scored the equaliser late in stoppage time against Aston Villa to pull Tottenham level at 4\u20134 and complete a remarkable comeback from 4\u20131 down. Since joining Tottenham, he rotated in the centre-back position with other defenders. However, Kaboul produced numerous errors that saw him out of the team on three separate occasions after the appointment of Juande Ramos. Kaboul came on as a 102nd-minute substitute for Robbie Keane as Tottenham beat Chelsea 2\u20131 in the 2008 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium on 24 February 2008. However, his return was short-lived as he suffered a knee injury and never played for the club for the rest of the season.
