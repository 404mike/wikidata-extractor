A centre-half, he started his career at his hometown club Swansea Town and made his professional debut in 1956.\nHe joined Middlesbrough in 1962 for a club record fee of \u00a325,000 and later played for Swindon Town. During his career, he also represented Wales at under-23 level and gained 12 caps at senior level.\nAfter retiring from football, he built a property portfolio that included several hotels and businesses in the Swansea area before, rejoining the football club as a member of the board. In 2001, he led a consortium in a takeover that is credited with saving the club from financial ruin. His lifelong association with the city of Swansea has seen him often referred to as \"Mr. Swansea\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swansea", "response": ["* Mel Nurse: 28 April 2016."]}, {"page": "Cwmbwrla", "response": ["Wales international footballers John and Mel Charles; Ivor and Len Allchurch; Mel Nurse; Jackie Roberts; and Ernie Jones were all born and raised in the area."]}, {"page": "Frank Burrows", "response": ["Frank Burrows began his football career at Scottish club Raith Rovers.

The decision, along with the perceived favouritism from UK governments believed to have been shown to the city since has been credited as the starting point of the deterioration of relations between the two sides. In 1956, the South Wales derby was played in the final of the Welsh Cup in front of a crowd of 37,500 at Ninian Park. The attendance remains the highest ever recorded in the Welsh Cup. Cardiff went on to win the match 3\u20132 despite being reduced to ten men within the opening 30 minutes when forward Gerry Hitchens suffered a broken leg. The following year, Cardiff recorded its first victory over Swansea at Vetch Field, winning 1\u20130 following a goal from Colin Hudson. The next meeting between the sides, in March 1959, resulted in Swansea achieving the same feat by winning at their rivals home ground for the first time in league competition. Mel Nurse scored the only goal of the game from a penalty, the first league goal Swansea had scored at Ninian Park."]}]}}
