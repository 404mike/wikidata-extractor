There have been four episodes, plus one video featuring outtakes. Empson wrote the entire series, which was produced by Matt Taylor. Kim's sister Denise features in two of the episodes, and Lorna Sinclair plays a B&B guest in the third episode. The official synopsis says: \"A camera crew is given access to all areas of 'Kim's Palace'. The team focus on her adventures (and mishaps) as she strives to raise her small business from the ashes of disaster, catapulting her into the realm of the Alan Sugars and Richard Bransons of this world. With Kim at the helm, surely nothing can go wrong. Can it?! Watch this space...\" Empson revealed in an interview with Digital Spy that she came up with the idea for the spin-off when she was on set thinking that the B&B should be used more, and more people should be seen staying there, but as most regular characters have their own homes, Empson though of a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at the B&B. Bryan Kirkwood was EastEnders executive producer at the time, and Empson had heard the B&B would be burnt down, but she was reassured that it would be refurbished. Lorraine Newman took over from Kirkwood and agreed to Empson's idea. Empson worked with the EastEnders web team to create the series, and they wanted it to be shorter than she did, so her scripts were edited but all her jokes were kept. Empson said of the series: \"It's still EastEnders, but at the same time it's going to be its own show. It's a standalone thing and Kim is showing how to run a successful business. She thinks that she's a bit like Hilary Devey, but she would give Hilary Devey a run for her money!
