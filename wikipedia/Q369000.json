Cramer's special guest on the tenth edition was E. Neville Isdell, CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. Incidentally, Cramer's interview with Isdell was filmed on location at that company's headquarters in Atlanta. This is the first Mad Money to be filmed outdoors and was filmed in the center atrium of the Management Building in the new Tech Square section of the campus. Georgia Tech was the final stop for the 2007 leg of the \"Back to School\" college tour."]}, {"page": "Neville Isdell", "response": ["#REDIRECT E.
