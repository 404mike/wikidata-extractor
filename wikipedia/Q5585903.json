Before the ruling was made, clubs throughout Europe were limited to the number of foreign players they could employ, and could only play a maximum of three in European competition.

The ruling ensured a team could now choose to play a team of 11 foreign players if it wanted,  as was the case when Chelsea became the first team to do so in December 1999. By 2007, the percentage of foreign players in England and Germany had reached 57%, compared with 39% in Spain and France and 30% in Italy.

On 29 February, LuaLua scored an 89th-minute equaliser against Newcastle in a 1\u20131 draw, later apologizing to Newcastle supporters. The law was again changed to block players from playing against their parent club, a move which Graham Taylor was critical of. Long-time Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has been critical of the rule on numerous occasions. In 2012, he asked for the rules to be changed so that only players aged 21 and under can be loaned; in 2013, he said the rule lacks \"integrity\"; and in 2014, said the system was \"not defendable\" and protects the clubs who loan players out.
