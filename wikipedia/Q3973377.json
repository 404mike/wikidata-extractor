We knew, even then, that Blitz and all it entailed and encouraged was going to be an important chapter in the story of London youth and their street-found fashions; and so, in a basement studio on Islington's Holloway Road, the Angel boys were busily trying to create a band who'd embody this latest twist in the tale. The band worked on what their guitarist/songwriter Gary Kemp referred to as \"white European disco music\" and presented it to their manager, Steve Dagger,: we were there developing a sound for our new identity\u2026 We finished playing the four or five songs we had and faced Dagger. who explained that they needed to get ready for their debut quickly because of the growing competition to be the breakout artist amongst their peers.: his words were frantic with concern. \"We have to get it out there quickly.

That was the kind of lyric, very early 80s lyric about a kind of heroic place that we all wanted to put ourselves.\" In his autobiography I Know This Much: From Soho to Spandau, he described the song as \"garage-band stuff \u2013 short, to the point, and very English.
