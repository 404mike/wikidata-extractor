The rear suspension was based on the cantilever system patented by Phil Vincent while at Cambridge. Comprising a rear frame member (RFM) of two upright triangular arms pivotting at the bottom of the frame and attached to two spring boxes and damper at the top, this system had been used on all Vincents from the first Vincent Special prototype built in 1927. Front suspension was the same friction-damped Brampton girder fork used on the Vincent singles. The larger engine intruded into the space previously occupied by the oil tank, so the Series A Rapide received a petrol tank with two fillers \u2013 one for petrol and one for oil as the tank was made to serve double duty.

A year before the factory closed in 1955, Vincent produced the enclosed range of Black Knight and Black Prince. Known as the 'Series D', the Black Knight was an upgraded Vincent Rapide which was fully enclosed to keep the rain and dirt from the rider. As well as allowing Vincent to reduce production costs, the enclosure actually improved performance by directing more air to the rear cylinder. Phil Vincent described it as a 'two-wheeled Bentley' and the enclosed Vincents got a lot of attention at the 1955 Earls Court show. Problems with production of the glass fibre mouldings meant that many riders removed them, which eventually led to financial difficulties and the factory closed on 16 December 1955.", "Falling sales of the Series C Vincent motorcycles during 1952 and 1953 was partly attributed to dated styling, so Phil Vincent sought to update the range and development began what were to become the Series D machines.  The main change was innovative full enclosure and weather protection, with glass fibre panels that included leg shields and a handlebar fairing.  This was not about streamlining for speed, as the Vincent was already powerful enough for riders of the day \u2013 it was instead about the idea that the rider could travel to work in a suit rather than full motorcycle kit. Care was taken to ensure that the engines were still easily accessible for general maintenance and the rear enclosure was hinged providing access to the rear wheel and drive chain."]}, {"page": "Vincent Meteor", "response": ["Vincent-HRD began in 1928 when Phil Vincent acquired the name, as well as all the jigs, tools and patterns of the HRD Company.

Vincent is quoted as saying at the time \"...we never wanted to see another Jap engine as long as we lived and decided we should design and manufacture our own.\" Designed by Australian engineer Phil Irving, the new engine was developed over three months and the prototype Series 'A' Meteor was refined and developed into a production model, the Series 'B' Meteor, which was produced at the same time as the Series 'C' Comet, with the main differences being the new Girdraulic front fork fitted to the Comet while the Meteor had traditional Brampton girder forks and a slightly smaller carburettor.
