He invented a process that enabled white soap to be made and a means of using china clay to create better quality paper. He owned several china clay pits in Cornwall, and a mine at Tredegar in South Wales, and was briefly a Liberal Member of Parliament. His wife was Agnes Pochin who was a leading suffragist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Agnes Pochin", "response": ["In 1870 Pochin and her husband moved south in order that her husband could travel more easily to the House of Commons. The Pochins still paid for a survey of Salford women and as a result over a thousand women were added to the voting register. Moreover, the Pochins paid for legal defence when the legality of this approach was challenged. In 1872 Agnes became a member of the executive Central Committee for Women's Suffrage. Her husband addressed the committee and he expressed the opinion that the committees meeting would mark a turning point in history. In 1873 her call for the women's suffrage was republished at last with non-de-plume but with the name of \"Mrs Henry Davis Pochin\". Over the next few years the central and Manchester committees received large sums from the Pochins. Pochin moved on to the Women's Emancipation Union in 1892 and over the next decade she made donations to local and national committees."]}]}}
