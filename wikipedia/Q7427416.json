Smith had been unable to resolve growing enmity between the Evangelicals and the Anglo-Catholics throughout this time.

Lampard inherited a strong congregation from Irvine.", "St Michael's has had a strong association with the Church of England's national leadership. Bishops William Broughton, Frederic Barker, and Archbishops Saumarez Smith, John Wright and Howard Mowll all demonstrated a special and personal focus in the leadership and strategy for St Michael's, resulting in a church with strong ties to the Evangelical tradition within the Anglican Church. The perceptible upgrading of St Michael's importance in the post war period has created associations with some of the leading figures within the denomination.

Rev. William Saumarez Smith, on 13 June 1891, alongside St. Andrew's church, which by that time had been in service for a decade or more. A large crowd was present for the ceremony, which was reported in the local press, and all the old families were well represented. The Cumberland Argus gave a full description of the building. It was being built by G. H. Stoker, who was both architect and contractor. In 1860 a parsonage was built between Seven Hills and Prospect, and paid for by public subscription. There were a couple of Catholic names among the subscribers. This parsonage was still standing in the 1920s. By 1890 however, St. Andrew's parishioners were determined to have a new parsonage of their own. Hence the visit of the Primate. The two-storey building would have nine rooms, bathroom, lavatory, study, kitchen, etc. The front was to be of attractive design, with cast iron columns to the full elevation. The bay window also was carried through to the roof and the balcony was to be  long. After laying the foundation stone there was a laying of donations on the stone. The trowel used was at least until recent years (1978) preserved in a glass case in the church."]}, {"page": "Percy W.

Assisted by a promise of \u00a31,000 from a wealthy parishioner, a foundation stone was laid by Archbishop Saumarez Smith on 27 September 1902 and the grand new edifice was built to the design of brother-in-law T.

Others who paid tribute included the Dean of Sydney, William Cowper, who said the parishioners would miss Garnsey\u2019s \u201ckindly words, his warm grasp of the hand, his kindly help and practical Christianity\u201d. The Rev George North Ash, of St. Augustine's Church, Neutral Bay, said that Garnsey \u201cwas a loyal and fearless exponent of those distinctive truths of the Catholic faith which it ever has been the glory of their Church to maintain and to assert. He never condescended to endeavour, for the sake of a false peace or an ephemeral popularity, to minimise, or to \"explain away,\" those doctrines which are too often forgotten, or apologised for, by timid or colourless nominal Church adherents, in deference to the spirit of compromise and the demands of the age in which we live.\u201d"]}]}}
