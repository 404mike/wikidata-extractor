Robinson's team scored 147 and 362 for eight declared, a match total of 509. In reply, the AIF scored 227 and were 274 for nine when time ran out, a match total of 501 leaving them nine runs and Robinson's team one wicket short of victory. The Australian team included the future New South Wales and Australian Test wicketkeeper Hammy Love in this match. It was his first-class debut but his sole appearance for the AIF.
