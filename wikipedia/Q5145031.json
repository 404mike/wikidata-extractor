Defeat to local rivals Crewe Alexandra marked the club's fifth consecutive loss, and after the game Adams accepted that his position would be under threat if results did not turn around quickly. Following six straight defeats Adams resigned as manager on 18 September after lengthy discussions with the chairman. The club would decline and suffer relegation after his departure, leading Adams to say in 2018 that: \"I\u2019m sad to see the Vale where they are.

Bristol Rovers needed a draw with Mansfield to avoid relegation to the Conference on the final day of the season, but after losing to a solitary strike by Colin Daniel, which, coupled with wins for Wycombe Wanderers and Northampton Town, ended the home side's 94-year-long tenure in the Football League, several Rovers fans flooded onto the pitch at the final whistle, chanting \"Sack the board\" and throwing abuse at the players and the away fans.

He scored his fourth goal of the season when he headed in Colin Daniel's cross to add to Mansfield's lead in a 5\u20130 win over Dartford at Field Mill. Two weeks later, on 16 February, he scored once again, poking in from close range to restore Mansfield's lead in a victory over Cambridge United. Jones' sixth of the season came when he headed in James Jennings' centre to give the club an important 2\u20131 away win against Woking on 6 March 2013. He scored the only goal of the game on the hour mark in Mansfield's 1\u20130 away win at Tamworth on 30 March, subsequently earning Mansfield a club record eleventh consecutive victory, as the run propelled them to the top of the Conference National table. He added one final goal to his tally in what was a goalscoring season for the defender, his eighth of the campaign coming in a 3\u20131 home win against Macclesfield Town, a win that moved Mansfield two points clear at the top with just three games remaining. Mansfield secured the title courtesy of a 1\u20130 win against Wrexham on the last day of the season, with Jones scoring eight times in 32 matches during the season."]}, {"page": "Damien McCrory", "response": ["He started the 2017\u201318 season with five appearances to his name, but with Stephen Warnock returning from injury Clough decided to allow McCrory to leave the club on loan.

Set to compete with Brandon Haunstrup for the left-back position at Fratton Park, he stated his aim was to find regular football Kenny Jackett's \"Pompey\". However he twisted his knee after three games and was forced to undergo surgery, and was unable to feature again for the remainder of his loan spell. He was offered a new contract by Burton at the end of the 2017\u201318 season, following their relegation out of the Championship.

The Third Round ties were played on the weekend beginning 7 January 2012. The draw made on 4 December 2011 gave Bolton an away tie at either Chelmsford City or Macclesfield Town who had drawn their second round tie. Macclesfield won the replay on 14 December. This marked the teams' second meeting of the season after their League Cup tie in August. Ivan Klasni\u0107 scored an early goal in the tie, his eighth of the season, before Macclesfield scored twice through Colin Daniel and Arnaud Mendy either side of half time. David Wheater, with his first goal for Bolton, equalised late in the second half, taking the game to a replay at the Reebok Stadium ten days later, which Bolton won 2\u20130. A goal within the first five minutes from Kevin Davies, his first since November, and Martin Petrov set up a home tie against Swansea City in the Fourth Round. The game took place on 29 January with Bolton winning 2\u20131. Darren Pratley's first goal for the club in first half injury time, against the team he left in the summer, equalised Luke Moore's opener for Swansea. Chris Eagles scored the winner early in the second half to send Bolton into the fifth round. The draw was held the following day and gave Bolton an away tie at either Millwall or Southampton who would be replaying their tie on 7 February. Milwall won the replay 3\u20132 and played Bolton on 18 February. Goals from Ryo Miyaichi, making his first start for the club, and David N'Gog took Bolton into the quarter finals for the second successive season where they were away to Tottenham Hotspur, who won their replayed tie against Stevenage. Bolton took the lead early in the first half through a Gareth Bale own goal but Kyle Walker equalised shortly afterwards. However, the game was abandoned after forty one minutes when Fabrice Muamba collapsed and was taken to hospital. After Muamba, who has suffered a cardiac arrest, showed signs of improvement in hospital, the game was rearranged for 27 March. This game, however, would prove to be Bolton's last in the competition that season. Although they went in goalless at half-time, Bolton had not had a single shot in that time. They eventually held out until the seventy fourth minute before Ryan Nelsen scored his first goal from Tottenham. This was quickly followed by another Spurs goal as Gareth Bale scored. Kevin Davies gave Bolton some hope with a late goal but this was quickly extinguished when Louis Saha scored in injury time."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|= ||MF || ||11 ||Colin Daniel || 2 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 3", "|11 || ||MF ||Colin Daniel || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Colin Daniel"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Colin Daniel"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Manager Micky Adams ended months of speculation surrounded his future when he signed a 12-month rolling contract the following in June 2014. His first signing of the season was versatile left-sided player Colin Daniel. Kaid Mohamed left the club on loan, after he agreed to spend the season playing for Northampton Town. Adams admitted he was finding it difficult to sign new players to take the club forward after losing out on numerous transfer targets to rival clubs. Chairman Norman Smurthwaite was criticised by fans for showing a lack of ambition, but Smurthwaite defended his record by pointing to falling season ticket sales and the high amount of time and money he had invested in the club without financial reward. The second signing of the season was 24-year-old full-back Ryan McGivern, who negotiated a release from relegated Scottish Premier League club Hibernian in order to sign a two-year contract with the Vale. The third arrival was winger Mark Marshall, who had spent the latter half of the previous campaign with Coventry City after serving a two-year ban for taking performance-enhancing drugs. His next signing was winger Byron Moore, who turned down a contract offer at nearby Crewe Alexandra to join the Vale. This capture raised the tensions between Vale and Crewe, particularly after Adams and Crewe boss Steve Davis had a spat over the departure of his son Joe Davis; his father claiming Vale's contract offer to Joe was \"derisory\". Adams looked at a number of players on trial over the summer, including: Michael O\u2019Connor, Steve Jennings, Javan Vidal, and Sylvestre Guyonet. Adams completed his squad on 18 July with a triple signing, taking on a trio of experienced midfielders: Michael Brown, Steve Jennings, and Michael O'Connor. He took the squad on a pre-season tour of Cornwall, including a stay at HMS Raleigh. Adams added to the squad by taking in versatile right-back Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Veseli on a long-term loan from Ipswich Town. Carl Dickinson was appointed as club captain in August 2014, taking the armband from the departed Doug Loft.", "Vale began 2015 with a home tie against Gillingham, and a victory took them to within a point of the play-offs thanks to a stoppage time winner from Colin Daniel. Shortly after Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Veseli's loan signing from Ipswich was made into a permanent deal. Going forward Page managed to adequately cover for the continuing absence of Pope by playing Ben Williamson as a lone striker supported by Louis Dodds in a central attacking midfield role. The next week's opponents, Chesterfield, were one place above Vale, but a 3\u20130 Chesterfield win put Vale four points and four places outside the play-offs; both chairman and manager described the performance as \"embarrassing\". This proved to be a temporary setback however, as Vale went on to beat Peterborough 2\u20131. A win over \"A500 derby\" rivals Crewe would then take Vale into the play-offs, but a 1\u20130 win completed a double over Vale for the \"Railwaymen\"; Neal saved a penalty he himself gave away but could not keep out Nicky Ajose's 39th-minute strike. Next opponents Barnsley tried to buy Tom Pope before Vale's visit to Oakwell. Pope played against Barnsley but it was goalkeeper Neal who opened the scoring after fumbling into his own net just before half-time; Barnsley went on to win the game 2\u20131. Pope stayed put throughout the remainder of the transfer window, instead it was N'Guessan who departed, whilst Tommy O'Sullivan and Greg Luer arrived on loan.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||14||align=\"left\"| Colin Daniel", "|6||MF||||14||Colin Daniel||4||0||0||0||4", "|14||||MF||Colin Daniel||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0", "|2 June 2014||MF||||Colin Daniel||Mansfield Town||Free||"]}]}}
