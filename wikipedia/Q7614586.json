He scored six times, against Greenock Morton, Partick Thistle, Dundee, Dunfermline Athletic (twice) and Berwick Rangers. This was his highest goal tally in a season. In mid-December 2009, Lawson signed a new two-year deal with the club. During the season, Lawson was in the squad throughout Ross County's campaign in the Scottish Cup with the club reaching the final after beating Celtic in the semi-final. A year later, Lawson said he felt he wasn't really involved in that match having only on as a substitute in the last minute.

Defenders Dave Winfield and Charles Dunne also left Wycombe for clubs in higher divisions (though Dunne was loaned back to Wycombe for the season as part of the transfer). He signed right-back Nick Arnold and midfielder Billy Knott on loan. In the January transfer window he sold 18-year-old centre-back Kortney Hause to Wolverhampton Wanderers, and signed 19-year-old former Arsenal winger Anthony Jeffrey on a free transfer. Wycombe ended an eight match run without a win with a 1\u20130 victory over league leaders Chesterfield on 22 February, earning Ainsworth a mention as the Football League manager of the week. On the final day of the season Wycombe needed to win at Torquay United and hope results went their way elsewhere in order to stay up; they won their match 3\u20130 and finished outside of the relegation zone on goal difference."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Scottish First Division", "response": ["| Steven Craig"]}, {"page": "Craig (surname)", "response": ["*Steven Craig (born 1981), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Scottish First Division", "response": ["| Steven Craig"]}, {"page": "Scott Morrison (footballer)", "response": ["He made his debut for the club, in a 2\u20130 loss against Livingston and he scored his first goal, the next game, in a 2\u20132 draw.
