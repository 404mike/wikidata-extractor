Despite this, Mirehouse made his first-class debut for the University a couple of weeks later, playing against the Gentlemen of England; a collection of the best amateur players in the country. Mirehouse was used as the second-change bowler for Cambridge, and took one wicket, that of Sandford Schultz. He featured again the following week, against a Marylebone Cricket Club and Ground side rated as relatively weak by Cricket. On a pitch ruined by rain, he bowled 24 overs without taking a wicket during a heavy defeat for Cambridge. He did not play again for Cambridge that year, but did go on to make his first appearances in county cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club.
