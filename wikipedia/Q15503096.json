In 1261, King Henry III gave permission for the Tolhouse to be used as a jail (gaol). The prison was in the basement of the building, and its main occupants of the jail were smugglers and pirates. In the 1400s, some inmates at the Tolhouse jail waited 10 years for a trial. In 1645, witch-hunter Matthew Hopkins used the Tolhouse jail during his witch trials, in which several local women were hanged. In the 18th century, the Tolhouse used hard labour, on a treadmill or picking oakum nearby. In the early 19th century, British prison visitor Sarah Martin criticised the living conditions in the jail, as the cells were too warm and the jail was unsanitary. She also objected to the fact that the inmates had no access to a church or chaplain. Until 1823, prisoners had to pay jail fees. In 1864, HM Inspectorate of Prisons criticised living conditions in the jail, as five people were sharing one room. They recommended that female prisoners be sent to Wymondham Bridewell, to allow for more space and better living conditions for the remaining prisoners. The underground cells stopped being used in 1836, and, later in the 19th century, the building's dungeons were used as storerooms."]}, {"page": "John Edmund Cox", "response": ["*A Brief Sketch of the Life of the Late Miss Sarah Martin of Great Yarmouth (Yarmouth, 1844) anonymous editor of the memoir of Sarah Martin"]}]}}
