Drummond became the most popular version of H'Angus with his outrageous antics.

A steward took offence at H'Angus standing up and leading the Hartlepool fans in song.

Hodcroft accepted the proposal but wanted the club to stay out of politics so forced Drummond to make the agenda his own and separate from the club. Drummond ran for mayor under his own name, campaigning for \"free bananas\" for all schoolchildren. He campaigned both at matches, much to the bemusement of opposition fans, and also locally and away from the football pitch. On 2 May 2002, days after Pools' play-off semi-final defeat at Cheltenham and an extension to the season that allowed the campaigning monkey to carry on his drive for votes, Drummond was elected the first directly elected mayor of Hartlepool. Drummond immediately decided to concentrate on politics and ceased being H'Angus; he was quoted as saying, \"I am Stuart Drummond, I am the Mayor of Hartlepool, not the monkey.\" Drummond was re-elected in 2005, more than doubling his vote (up to over 16,000) and increasing his majority to over 10,000.

Dozens of fans applied for the auditions and they were cut down to six. The final six auditionees then had to wear the famous costume and perform for a half during Hartlepool's pre-season friendlies. Student Ceri Anderson was deemed the \"most monkey-like\" and won the job as H'Angus. She had applied for the job after being encouraged by her 7-year-old son, Ralf.
