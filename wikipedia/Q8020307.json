Written in 1860, its author, William Whiting, was inspired by the dangers of the sea described in Psalm 107. It was popularised by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy in the late 19th century, and variations of it were soon adopted by many branches of the armed services in the United Kingdom and the United States. Services who have adapted the hymn include the Royal Marines, Royal Air Force, the British Army, the United States Coast Guard and the United States Marine Corps, as well as the navies of many Commonwealth realms. Accordingly, it is known by many names, variously referred to as the Hymn of Her Majesty's Armed Forces, the Royal Navy Hymn, the United States Navy Hymn (or just The Navy Hymn), and sometimes by the last line of its first verse, \"For Those in Peril on the Sea\". The hymn has a long tradition in civilian maritime contexts as well, being regularly invoked by ship's chaplains and sung during services on ocean crossings.", "The original hymn was written in 1860 by William Whiting, an Anglican churchman from Winchester, United Kingdom. Whiting grew up near the ocean on the coasts of England and at the age of thirty-five had felt his life spared by God when a violent storm nearly claimed the ship he was travelling on, instilling a belief in God's command over the rage and calm of the sea. As headmaster of the Winchester College Choristers' School some years later, he was approached by a student about to travel to the United States, who confided in Whiting an overwhelming fear of the ocean voyage. Whiting shared his experiences of the ocean and wrote the hymn to \"anchor his faith\". In writing it, Whiting is generally thought to have been inspired by Psalm 107, which describes the power and fury of the seas in great detail:"]}, {"page": "William Whiting", "response": ["William Whiting may refer to:", "*William Whiting (poet) (1825\u20131878), English writer and hymnist", "*William Whiting (Massachusetts politician) (1813\u20131873), member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts", "*William Whiting II (1841\u20131911), member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts", "* William Whiting (1660\u20131724), Colonel of a provincial regiment from Connecticut during the Siege of Port Royal (1710)."]}, {"page": "StarCraft", "response": ["The original material for the Wings of Liberty soundtrack spans approximately four hours.
