He worked for the British Foreign Office as a diplomat, becoming known as a humanitarian activist, and later as a poet and Easter Rising leader. Described as the \"father of twentieth-century human rights investigations\", he was honoured in 1905 for the Casement Report on the Congo and knighted in 1911 for his important investigations of human rights abuses in the rubber industry in Peru.In Africa as a young man, Casement first worked for commercial interests before joining the British Colonial Service. In 1891 he was appointed as a British consul, a profession he followed for more than 20 years. Influenced by the Boer War and his investigation into colonial atrocities against indigenous peoples, Casement grew to mistrust imperialism. After retiring from consular service in 1913, he became more involved with Irish republicanism and other separatist movements. \nDuring World War I, he made efforts to gain German military aid for the 1916 Easter Rising that sought to gain Irish independence. He was arrested, convicted and executed for high treason. He was stripped of his knighthood and other honours. Before the trial, the British government circulated excerpts said to be from his private journals, known as the Black Diaries, which detailed homosexual activities. Given prevailing views and existing laws on homosexuality, this material undermined support for clemency for Casement. Debates have continued about these diaries: a handwriting comparison study in 2002 concluded that Casement had written the diaries, but this was still contested by some.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 3", "response": ["*1916 \u2013 Roger Casement, Irish poet and activist (b. 1864)"]}, {"page": "Human cannibalism", "response": ["Roger Casement, writing to a consular colleague in Lisbon on August 3, 1903, from Lake Mantumba in the Congo Free State, said:"]}, {"page": "History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo", "response": ["The Congo Free State was a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II of Belgium through the Association Internationale africaine, a non-governmental organization.

Increasing rapidly to a strength of nearly 200,000 by mid-1914, it split in September of that year over John Redmond's commitment to the British War effort, with the smaller group retaining the name of \"Irish Volunteers\".", "*Members: Piaras B\u00e9asla\u00ed (Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB)), Sir Roger Casement (GL), \u00c9amonn Ceannt (IRB, GL, SF), John Fitzgibbon (GL, SF), Liam Gogan, Bulmer Hobson (IRB, Fianna \u00c9ireann (F\u00c9)), Michael J.

The \"Curragh incident\" (also referred to as the \"Curragh Mutiny\") of March 1914, indicated that the government could not rely on its army to ensure a smooth transition to Home Rule.Fergusson, Sir James The Curragh Incident, London, 1964. Then in April 1914 the Ulster Volunteers successfully imported 24,000 rifles in the Larne Gun Running event. The Irish Volunteers realised that it too would have to follow suit if they were to be taken as a serious force. Indeed, many contemporary observers commented on the irony of \"loyal\" Ulstermen arming themselves and threatening to defy the British government by force. Patrick Pearse famously replied that \"the Orangeman with a gun is not as laughable as the nationalist without one.\" Thus O'Rahilly, Sir Roger Casement and Bulmer Hobson worked together to co-ordinate a daylight gun-running expedition to Howth, just north of Dublin."]}]}}
