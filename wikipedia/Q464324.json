Shaw and her manager Eve Taylor were permitted to select one of the finalists, submitting \"Had a Dream Last Night\", written by her regular songwriter and producer Chris Andrews, who had previously had a song in the 1965 UK final, \"One Day\", performed by Kathy Kirby. Shaw had recorded a version of that track herself. Viewers voted on postcards via mail to decide the winner and the chosen song was \"Puppet on a String\". After placing second five times, the UK finally won Eurovision 10 years after the nation's first entry performed by Patricia Bredin in 1957."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1965", "response": ["The BBC internally selected the singer for the second time. They chose a solo female singer, Kathy Kirby, whose looks were compared to Marilyn Monroe and who had just scored four consecutive top 20 hit singles. The song was then selected by viewers of The Kathy Kirby Show on BBC1, casting votes on postcards via post, with the winner \"I Belong\", receiving 110,495 votes. Kirby released all six songs from the UK final on an Extended Play maxi single BBC TV's A Song for Europe, which reached number 9 in the UK EP top 20 chart. She subsequently re-recorded the winner and the runner up with different arrangements and released these tracks on a single, which peaked at number 36 in the UK singles chart. Chris Andrews had written one of the six finalists, One Day which was recorded by Sandie Shaw with whom he regularly collaborated. Shaw would be the artist selected to represent the UK in the 1967 contest, when again Andrews submitted a song."]}]}}
