Three years later he was called into the Somerset side for five matches when regular wicketkeeper Wally Luckes was ill. He took eight catches, and Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1931 said that he \"rendered useful service in that capacity\". He stood up to the wicket to all bowlers, even the fastest. The county offered him a professional contract but he decided to stay with the railway.Clark is chiefly remembered as a batsman. In nine innings in the five games, he failed to score a single run. In the match against Northamptonshire at Kettering, he was not out in both innings and failed to score, but otherwise he was out for 0, bowled five times and caught twice. Nine innings is believed to be the record for a first-class cricketer who failed to score a single run. John Howarth of Nottinghamshire played in 13 matches without scoring, but batted only seven times.\nIn Clark's obituary in Wisden 1996 edition, it is reported that the Essex and England bowler Peter Smith, bowling Essex to an overwhelming victory at Colchester, attempted to give him a run. He bowled so gently to Clark that the ball bounced twice before reaching the batsman. Clark was still bowled by it. In club cricket, Clark reckoned his highest score was three.\nClark remained with the railway until he retired to Weston-super-Mare in 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["Many cricketers with short first-class careers fail to ever score a run, and finish with a batting average of 0.00.

A career of 13 first-class matches without a run is the world record. However, Howarth only batted seven innings in these matches (out of a theoretical maximum of 26, had he batted in two innings per game). In those he was dismissed four times for a duck, and finished not out without scoring on three other occasions, giving him a career best score of 0*. According to Lynch, the record for most innings in a career without scoring a run appears to belong to Seymour Clark, who played for Somerset County Cricket Club as a wicket-keeper in the 1930 season.

But after two seasons, he suffered nearly four years of ill-health, and was able to play in only a few matches in 1929 and 1930, and none at all in 1931. The high regard that Somerset had for Luckes was reflected by the fact that he was maintained on the staff during this long absence: for one of the perennially more cash-strapped counties, with one of the smaller playing staffs, this was a rare degree of commitment. Somerset used a variety of amateur and professional wicketkeepers in Luckes' absence, including Seymour Clark, the ultimate non-batsman, and Frank Lee, the opening batsman who later became a Test umpire.
