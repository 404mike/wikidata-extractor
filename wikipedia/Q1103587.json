Two days after the Bolton match, Derby manager Nigel Clough praised O'Connor by saying; \"With only two [league] games played this season, we've seen the value of James already. He can play anywhere across the back four and he just slots in with no fuss whatsoever. He's a good, competent Championship player and there aren't too many about like him who can come in and do a job in so many positions; he's a very good and important player to have in the camp.\" He scored his first goal for the \"Rams\" in a 2\u20130 home win over Barnsley on 6 November.

The win was followed by a 1\u20130 defeat away to League Two side Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup First Round, the club's second successive defeat by a lower league side in the competition's opening stage, and saw injuries to Russell Anderson and Chris Porter weaken the Rams squad further. They were later joined by Ryan Connolly, who was ruled out for six months with a cruciate knee ligament injury incurred during an Under-18's friendly. Luke Varney, who was linked with another loan spell away from the club, made a shock return to the first team line-up after a year when Rob Hulse was ruled out for the home game against Cardiff City, leaving Varney as the only available striker on the books. Although Varney laid on Derby's goal for Tomasz Cwyka, the club fell to a second consecutive defeat as Cardiff ran out 2\u20131 winners. Despite being the sole forward fully fit and available, Varney was left out of the trip to Coventry City, to prevent a risk of injury ahead of a proposed loan move to an unidentified club. Left-back Dean Moxey was employed as a lone striker and scored his first for the club as it fell to another 2\u20131 defeat. After the match, it was revealed that Varney had joined Premier League club Blackpool on a season long deal, with a view to a \u00a3500k permanent move.

The promise of the imminent return of the defensive trio was dampened by the news first-choice goalkeeper Stephen Bywater has been ruled out for four weeks with a wrist injury sustained in training. The club moved to bring in a loan keeper, as they had the previous campaign while Bywater was suspended, and were linked with former number one Lee Grant and former target, Blackburn Rovers stopper Frank Fielding. Fielding eventually joined ahead of the Preston North End game on an emergency four-week deal. Saul Deeney was then ruled out of contention due to being placed on compassionate leave due to a serious family illness, leading to a recall for Ross Atkins from his loan spell at Tamworth, with James Severn instead sent to the club as a compensatory replacement. Fielding kept a clean sheet on his debut, a 3\u20130 victory over Preston North End and then helped The Rams to a second consecutive win as they beat Doncaster Rovers 3\u20132 at Keepmoat Stadium to reach 7th in the table, the club's highest league position since the opening day of the 2009\u201310 season. The run ended with a 2\u20130 reverse at Millwall, though a 4\u20131 home win over Watford saw The Rams end the month with 10 points from a possible 15.

A 2\u20130 defeat at Leicester City was followed by a 3\u20132 win over Scunthorpe United, despite being reduced to 10-man after Gareth Roberts became the first Derby player of the season to be sent off.

Clough made five changes to the side humiliated at Nottingham Forest just three days before. Dean Leacock, heavily criticised as \"offering nothing\" the previous game, was dropped to the bench, and Stephen Pearson, Conor Doyle and a returning Robbie Savage introduced into the midfield. Two enforced changes came with Gareth Roberts replacing the suspended Dean Moxey and Chris Porter making his first start of the league campaign as a replacement for Luke Moore, who returned to W.B.A. on the completion of his three-month loan. In the event, the changes earned Derby a first win in 6 as a Porter double sealed a 2\u20131 win at the division's bottom club.

The return of just seven points from the last nine fixtures was beginning to affect attendances, with just 24,239 attending the Millwall draw, the lowest attendance for a league match at Pride Park Stadium for almost four years, when just 23,122 attended an evening kick-off victory against Burnley on Tuesday 30 January. It was the third time in the 2010\u201311 campaign that attendances had dipped below 25,000 for a league fixture, something which had previously nor occurred since the said fixture against Burnley. The numbers, plus the nature of the support, led captain Robbie Savage to criticise the club's support, saying \"What you want them to do when we are not playing well is get behind us. It's as if they're waiting for a mistake to get on our backs.\" However, the club's slight revival was undermined by a giant killing at the hands of non-league Crawley in the FA Cup third round, described by reporters as one of the \"biggest FA Cup shocks of all time\" and others as the most \"humiliating result in Derby County's history\". The result saw Clough's job at the club reportedly come under threat as he issued an apology to the club's supporters, many of whom responded with demands for his dismissal Derby's Chief Executive Tom Glick answered fan's concerns by reiterating the club's support for Clough, saying \"Nigel is absolutely our guy. We have been clear about that continuously\" and promising investment in the playing staff in the current transfer window.

Contract-rebel Kris Commons joined Celtic for a fee of around \u00a3300k, turning down a \u00a3500k overture from Celtic's Old Firm rivals who failed to match his wage demands. Left back Dean Moxey was the subject of a \u00a3400,000 bid from Crystal Palace, which was accepted by Derby. Clough stated the bid's acceptance was football, rather than financially related, explaining \"He (Moxey) has not really progressed this season as much as we hoped. We just thought it was a good offer. We have got another good left back in Gareth Roberts and we can always get cover in on loan if we need it.\" Other departures saw Medi Abalimba, whose contract at Derby was terminated but the club held onto his registration, join Oldham Athletic on a free and the young trio of Graham Kelly, Mitchell Hanson and Kallum Keane had their contracts canceled five months early by mutual consent.
