Dunfermline dominated most of the match and started well with Andy Kirk scoring early with a neat finish. After half-time Inverness scored from a deflected Greg Tansey shot, then Dunfermline pulled ahead with another goal from Kirk. The visitors rallied as Dunfemline sat back further and further allowing Inverness to score twice more from Jonny Hayes, after a spilled save by Gallacher, and a Tansey header. Deep into stoppage time Martin Hardie curled a 30-yard free kick into the top corner to equalise. Final score: 3\u20133 .</", "In Dunfermline's first away trip of the SPL season they came out the victors. An early goal for the hosts was ruled out for a handball, and a resulting yellow card for the defender. From a clever corner routine Jason Thomson curled the ball through to Kirk, who fired in from short range. At this point Kirk was now the leading goalscorer in the SPL. Martin Hardie then went close to scoring against his former club with a header from a corner. With half an hour to go in the game John Potter tripped Francisco Sandaza and was sent off,(though this was later rescinded to a yellow</) with a penalty awarded to the hosts. The resulting penalty was taken by Liam Craig and was saved by Paul Gallacher, his second penalty save in three games. Despite the extra man advantage St Johnstone rarely looked like scoring and the few chances they did have was dealt with by the keeper comfortably. Final Score: 1\u20130</", "The visitors started strongly, on a day with hollowing gales swirling through the stadium, with some early chances. Rory Fallon just failed to make contact with a low cross and Josh Magennis somehow failed to score in a goalmouth scramble. He then vented his anger by shoving the home keeper in the chest and full in the face. However, the referee inexplicably decided that the violent conduct from him merited only a yellow card. The home fans were even more infuriated when Paul Willis tried to take a quick free-kick, and apparently was deemed to have committed an equal offence as Magennis, so was yellow carded for his effort. Andy Kirk should have hit the target with a turning snap-shot, and David Graham was also guilty of missing the target with a close range diving header after an excellent move by Dufermline. Aberdeen were looking dangerous from set-pieces and deservedly took the lead right on half-time with a header by Andrew Considine from a Fraser Fyvie corner. Paddy Boyle was then lucky to escape with a yellow after his two-footed challenge on Fyvie. Dunfermline then equalised from a Graham corner, Andrew Barrowman's header was blocked on the line, but he was first on hand to put away the rebound. Then, from Willis's superb diagonal ball, Graham cut inside from the left and rifled inside the near post of David Gonzalez to take the lead. Aberdeen nearly stuck back straight away with Youl Mawene keeping the ball away from Paul Gallacher and cutting it back, only for Magennis to miss the target with no keeper in the goal. Boyle did well to turn past the defenders and force in shot which was parried to Liam Buchanan, whose first touch coming on as a sub was to make it 3\u20131. Immediately from the restart Gallacher saved one-on-one with Magennis, showing Aberdeen could score again. From a quick Martin Hardie free-kick, Buchanan cut the ball back and Barrowman looked odds on the score, only for Gonzalez to somehow tip his point blank range onto the post. Straight away Aberdeen won a corner and from it Alex Keddie headed in an own goal. From then on it was all Aberdeen, and the visitors final scored a fourth. From a long throw-in Magennis managed to turn a smash home the equaliser. Final score 3\u20133.</", "| Martin Hardie", "|Martin Hardie"]}]}}
