He authored many books on cricket, including biographies, co-written with the subjects, of David Lloyd, David Gower and Tony Greig. In the field of racing, he wrote a 2002 biography of the jockey Richard Johnson.\nIn 2001, Lee won the SJA Sports Writer of the Year and the Racing Journalist of the Year awards. He was named the Racing Journalist of the Year again in 2003. He headed London Times' cricket coverage from 1988 to 1999 between the stints of two of the biggest names in cricket journalism in the second half of 20th century : John Woodcock was Times' Cricket Correspondent from 1954 to 1988, and Christopher Martin-Jenkins from 1999 to 2008.\nLee underwent heart surgery on 6 November 2015 and was expected to make a full recovery. He attended Ascot on 18 December where he was reportedly in \"sparkling form\". Lee died unexpectedly the following day, aged 61.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ted Dexter", "response": ["* Alan Lee, Lord Ted: The Dexter Enigma, Gollancz/Witherby, 1995"]}, {"page": "Alan Lee", "response": ["Alan Lee may refer to:", "*Alan Lee (bandleader) (born 1936), Australian jazz band leader, vibraphonist, guitarist and percussionist", "*Alan Lee (illustrator) (born 1947), English book illustrator and movie conceptual designer", "*Alan Lee (footballer) (born 1978), Irish footballer", "*Alan Lee (cricket writer) (1954\u20132015), British cricket writer"]}, {"page": "Laureate Academy", "response": ["* Alan Lee (cricket writer), racing correspondent from 1999 to 2015 for The Times"]}, {"page": "Mark Ray", "response": ["* The Ashes: England in Australia 1990-91 (with Alan Lee) 1991"]}, {"page": "Sarah Potter", "response": ["She is the daughter of the dramatist Dennis Potter.\"Fast bowler with a difference\", The Times, April 24, 1982.

Jan Brittin and Wendy Watson opened the batting for England; Watson was dropped in the first over, but only added five runs before being bowled by Sarah McLauchlan. That wicket brought Hodges to the crease: Brittin and Hodges were the leading run-scorers during the tournament, and Alan Lee of The Times described their partnership as \"accomplished and assured\" as they patiently put on 85 runs together. During her innings, Brittin became the first player to score 1,000 runs in Women's World Cup matches. Brittin was dismissed 15 minutes before lunch, caught at mid-wicket by Karen Gunn off the bowling of McLauchlan for 48 runs, leaving England 96 for two. After the wicket, Hodges and Plimmer scored 18 runs in just under 10 overs before both were dismissed in quick succession: Hodges was stumped by Illingworth off the bowling of Catherine Campbell for 45, while Plimmer was run out for 11. Their wickets brought Jo Chamberlain and Barbara Daniels in to bat. The pair played more positively, working the ball into gaps in the field and taking quick singles. Chamberlain was dropped when she had scored seven runs: in all, New Zealand dropped four catches during the final, in stark contrast to the excellent fielding that had earned them plaudits during the group stage. Chamberlain scored 38 runs from 33 deliveries before missing the ball while aiming a big shot at the Tavern Stand, and being bowled by Julie Harris. She was given a standing ovation by the MCC members as she walked off the pitch. Daniels and Karen Smithies added another 20 runs in the final few overs to take England to 195 for five: they scored 81 of their 195 runs from the last 12 overs."]}]}}
