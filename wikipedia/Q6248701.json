It was also confirmed that Carla would get a stand-alone episode, which has been compared to MacLeod's production at Emmerdale, in which he created an episode focused around Ashley Thomas' (John Middleton) dementia. Commenting on this, MacLeod has added, \"We're doing something a little bit stylised, like the Ashley story I did at Emmerdale, but it won't be quite as extreme as that. It's a stand-alone episode that will be both mental health-focused and Carla focused. It will also be the reveal to the audience of who is behind the factory roof collapsing. I'd hesitate to put a diagnosis on what it is affecting Carla, but the factory collapse has lots of unexpected offshoots into areas that give our amazing cast a chance to show off their acting chops.\""]}, {"page": "Inside Soap Awards", "response": ["| Simon Gregson (Steve McDonald in Coronation Street)Danny Dyer (Mick Carter in EastEnders)John Middleton (Ashley Thomas in Emmerdale)", "| John Middleton (Ashley Thomas in Emmerdale)", "| Colson Smith and Lucy Fallon (Craig Tinker and Bethany Platt in Coronation Street)John Middleton and Charlotte Bellamy (Ashley and Laurel Thomas in Emmerdale)Ryan Hawley and Danny Miller (Robert Sugden and Aaron Dingle in Emmerdale)"]}, {"page": "Eden Valley (film)", "response": ["*John Middleton as Townie Husband"]}, {"page": "Soapstar Superchef", "response": ["|Richard Grieve, John Middleton"]}, {"page": "Douglas Potts", "response": ["Douglas \"Doug\" Potts is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, played by Duncan Preston.
