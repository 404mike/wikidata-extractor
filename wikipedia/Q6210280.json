He was later elected to Belfast City Council in 1981 and in 1982 to the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nHendron was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Belfast West between April 1992 and May 1997 in the UK Parliament in London. He had taken the seat from Sinn F\u00e9in President Gerry Adams at his third attempt with a majority of 1%. He became the only nationalist MP to defeat Adams. The seat had previously been held for the SDLP by Gerry Fitt (later Lord Fitt) until 1983. Hendron attracted unprecedented cross-community support from Nationalists and Unionists in the constituency. This was the only example where an SDLP candidate received a high number of Unionist votes in Belfast West that un-seated a Sinn F\u00e9in candidate. Adams regained the seat at the next election in May 1997.\nIn 1996, Hendron was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum and in 1998 to the newly reconvened Northern Ireland Assembly. However, he lost his seat in the 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election to a member of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party.\nHe was appointed a member of the Northern Ireland Parades Commission in 2005. He retired from this role in December 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gerry Adams", "response": ["Sinn F\u00e9in continued its policy of refusing to sit in the Westminster Parliament after Adams won the Belfast West constituency.

In 1987 Adams narrowly held his seat, but lost it in the 1992 general election amidst a strong tactical voting campaign in favour of Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party by unionists in the Shankill Road area of the constituency. After the election a constituent, Maura McCrory, lodged an election petition challenging the result. The election court reported Hendron personally guilty of the illegal practice of failing to deliver a declaration verifying the return of his election expenses, and guilty through his election agent of failing to deliver a verified return of election expenses within 35 days, exceeding the maximum spending by \u00a3782.02, and failing to pay all the expenses within 28 days. Hendron's agent was also reported personally guilty of distributing election material without the name and address of the printer and publisher. The Judges granted both Hendron and his agent relief from their findings, on the grounds that the law had been broken through inadvertence; they therefore certified that Hendron had been duly elected.\"McCrory v Hendron\" [1993] NI QBD 177.", "The Member of Parliament since a 2011 by-election is Paul Maskey of Sinn F\u00e9in, who succeeded Gerry Adams, the party president.

Her campaigning led to the start of the aforementioned inquiry, announced in 1989 by the home secretary Douglas Hurd, into the Guildford bomb cases, which led to Gerry's release.
