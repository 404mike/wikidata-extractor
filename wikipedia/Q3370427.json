Teague made his test debut on 2 February 1985 aged 24, in the then five nations, as a substitute for Jon Hall in a 9\u20139 draw against  at Twickenham. He was then selected for England's final game of the tournament against Wales but the match was called off due to icy conditions and John Hall won his place back for the re-arranged fixture. Teague made his full test d\u00e9but on the summer tour of New Zealand the same year, playing in both test matches. He was not selected to represent England at any level for a further three years before playing for England B against Russia in 1988, eventually re-gaining his place in the full England team in a 12\u201312 draw with  in the 1989 five nations. In order to bulk up and regain his place in the England team he trained every day with body builders in the local gym, as well as doing 'Mad Dog' training with Gloucester. That involved hill running, often at three-quarter pace, carrying logs and rocks. It was intense and he had to find the time for daily training between his work as a builder. He went on to play in 3 matches during the 1990 five nations and was a key member of England's Grand Slam team of 1991, scoring the only try in England's 25\u20136 win against Wales in Cardiff on 19 January, England's first win in Cardiff for 28 years, as well as scoring against Ireland in England's victory in Dublin. In the same year he helped England reach the World Cup final, playing in five of England's six matches including the final, a narrow 12\u20136 defeat to Australia at Twickenham. The world cup final was his last appearance for a year; he sat out the 1992 Five Nations suffering from injury and exhaustion. However, he would reappear in England colours, playing against South Africa on their return to Twickenham after the sporting embargo had been lifted.  His final England cap was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in the 5 nations in 1993.  second row Paul Ackford christened Teague 'Iron Mike' at the time when Mike Tyson was world heavyweight champion.

Sean Fitzpatrick, (former All Black hooker and most capped All Black of all time), Shaun Edwards (coach London Wasps/Wales), Warren Gatland (former All Black and coach Wales), Jason Leonard (most capped prop in history), Martin Johnson (2003 World Cup Winning captain and ex-England Coach), Brian Moore, Paul Ackford and Josh Kronfeld (All Black), amongst others have and continue to raise concerns that the Stellenbosch Laws will be to the detriment of the game. The reduction of breaks in the game, faster paced play and the tendency to mix backs and forwards requires the players to be fitter and more athletic. This may produce the desired effect for television viewers watching the elite players, but the requirements may make rugby virtually unplayable for participants at the amateur level, undermining a fundamental claim of Rugby Union, that it is a game for \"all shapes and all sizes\". The law allowing collapsing of a maul has become a major worry at community level because of the dangers it may cause inexperienced players."]}, {"page": "List of University of Kent people", "response": ["*Paul Ackford - former England Rugby and British and Irish Lions rugby player, The Sunday Telegraph sports journalist"]}]}}
