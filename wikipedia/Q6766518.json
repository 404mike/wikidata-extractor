(An index of \"Our Bold\" from issues 1\u201334 appeared in issue 35, Autumn 2011). The magazine prided itself on high editorial standards and on close and accurate reading where others appear to have read superficially. Unashamedly nostalgic for the informed critical discourse of magazines such as the Paris Review, it was strongly associated with New College, Oxford, where its editorial offices were. The journal's trademark feather, or quill, which adorned its cover was created by the British artist Mark Alexander."]}, {"page": "Mark Alexander (politician)", "response": ["Mark Alexander (February 7, 1792 \u2013 October 7, 1883) was a nineteenth-century slave owner, lawyer and political figure from Virginia."]}, {"page": "Mark Alexander", "response": ["Mark Alexander may refer to:", "*Mark Alexander (politician) (1792\u20131883), American lawyer", "*Mark Alexander (cricketer) (born 1962), English cricketer", "*Mark Alexander (keyboardist) (born 1963), pianist currently with the Neverland Express", "*Mark Alexander (painter) (born 1966), British artist"]}, {"page": "Humphrey Ocean", "response": ["For the BBC, on Radio 4 he featured in Will Gompertz Gets Creative (2015), presented The Essay on Radio 3 on Impington Village College (2016) and Only Artists with Mark Alexander on Radio 4 (2018).

V. Young musicologists and musicians have the chance to promote their academic or artistic studies. They stay in the Villa Wasmuth, get direct access to the sources and facilities of the Beethoven-Haus and are supported by the staff and even the honorary members of the Beethoven-Haus Society. Among the mentees were chamber music ensembles as the Elias String Quartet (2013) and the Trio Rafaele (2015), soloists as the pianists Sunwook Kim (2013), Rafael Lipstein and Olga Pashchenko (2014), Karim Said (2015) and the cellist Jonas Palm (2015) so far. Furthermore, the Swiss musicologist Dominique Ehrenbaum could intensify his studies about fugues in Beethoven's late work (2013). In January 2014 the British artist Mark Alexander (painter) was commissioned by the Beethoven-Haus Society to paint a Beethoven portrait. Until spring 2015 the Villa Wasmuth was his studio, where he created a work cycle of five paintings after the famous Beethoven portrait by Joseph Karl Stieler.
