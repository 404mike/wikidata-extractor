Kerry, the youngest son of Dennis Harrington of Castletownbere, Co. Cork, and younger brother of the much better known Timothy Harrington, also an Irish Nationalist M.P.  His mother was Ellen O\u2019Sullivan.   He was a barrister, though not a member of the Irish bar.   He was editor and proprietor of the Kerry Sentinel, and in this role came into conflict with the authorities. In 1883 he was found guilty of posting unlawful notices, and in 1887 was sentenced to one month's imprisonment for publishing the proceedings of the Tralee branch of the National League, which had been 'proclaimed' (banned). In 1888 he was charged with publishing reports of meetings of the National League and inciting people to take part in the Plan of Campaign, and was sentenced to six months with hard labour.He was first elected at the 1885 general election as an Irish Parliamentary Party candidate, when he won nearly 90% of the votes to defeat his only opponent, the Conservative Lt. Col. William Rowan. Harrington was returned unopposed in 1886, and when the Irish Party split in 1891, he sided with the minority Parnellite faction. At the 1892 general election, he was defeated by the Anti-Parnellite Sir Thomas Esmonde. Esmonde was the outgoing MP for South County Dublin, and had stood in 1892 in both constituencies; he lost his Dublin seat to a Unionist, but won in Kerry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1902 in Ireland", "response": ["* 29 May \u2013 Edward Harrington, Member of Parliament (MP) for West Kerry 1885\u20131892 (born c.1852)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Harrington"]}, {"page": "West Kerry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=2| Edward Harrington"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Harrington"]}, {"page": "Edward Harrington", "response": ["Edward Harrington may refer to:", "*Edward Harrington (politician) (c. 1852\u20131902), Irish politician, Member of Parliament (MP) for West Kerry 1885\u20131892", "*Edward Harrington (poet) (1895\u20131966), Australian poet and short story writer", "*Edward Harrington (born 1935), American blues musician better known as Eddy Clearwater", "*Edward Harrington Jennings (1937\u20132019), president of University of Wyoming and The Ohio State University"]}]}}
