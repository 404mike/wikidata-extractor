Mike also discovers that Susan is cheating on her fianc\u00e9 with an older, married man (Karl Michael Vogler) who was Mike's physical education teacher and works at the baths as a swimming instructor for teenage girls, touching them inappropriately. Mike begins following Susan on her dates with Chris and the instructor and trying to disrupt them. Although Susan often gets angry at Mike for this, she provides just enough encouragement to cause him to continue the behavior. Mike's infatuation with Susan continues despite his friends mocking him, his mother being treated rudely by Susan, his bicycle being destroyed by Susan, and his activities drawing the ire of Susan's boyfriends, local police, and Mike's boss at work. Obsessed with Susan, Mike refuses other outlets for sex, such as his former girlfriend and a prostitute who offers him a discount. While following Susan on a date, Mike sees and steals a life-sized advertising photo cut-out of a naked girl who resembles Susan. He confronts Susan with it on the London Underground, flying into a violent tantrum in front of other passengers when Susan teasingly refuses to tell him whether she posed for the nude photo. Mike then takes the cut-out to the deserted baths after hours and swims naked with it, embracing it.", "* Chris Sandford as Chris, the fianc\u00e9"]}, {"page": "English Freakbeat, Volume 5", "response": ["# Chris Sandford: \"I Wish They Wouldn't Always Say I Sound Like The Guy From The USA Blues\"", "# Chris Sandford: \"I Wish They Wouldn't Always Say I Sound Like The Guy From The USA Blues\""]}, {"page": "A French Mistress", "response": ["* Chris Sandford as Poole"]}, {"page": "Before Winter Comes", "response": ["* Chris Sandford as Johnny"]}, {"page": "List of Coronation Street characters (1963)", "response": ["Walter Potts was Dennis Tanner's big discovery in his short-lived career as a talent agent.
