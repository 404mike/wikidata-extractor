Following this the Vale were exceptional at home but poor away, as their unbeaten run at home reached fifteen games. Their home form was exemplified by 6\u20134 and 7\u20130 wins over Aldershot and Watford respectively, in which Ronnie Allen scored a hat-trick in both games, and Morris Jones score a hat-trick past Aldershot. The defence seeming too weak for a promotion push, Harry Hubbick was signed from Bolton Wanderers in October. The Sentinel's \"Placer\" complained of the weakened passing of the post-war generation, in both the Vale side and in footballers in general. In November Morris Jones was sold to Swindon Town for \u00a32,500, having handed in a transfer request. Gordon Hodgson searched for new attacking talents, leaving his players to relax with games of table tennis, darts, and reading material. On Christmas day a 5\u20130 win was recorded over Brighton & Hove Albion, with defender Tommy Cheadle put into the centre-forward role. This marked the start of an eight match unbeaten run which took the \"Valiants\" into fourth place by the end of January.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Harry Hubbick", "| October 1947 || DF ||  || Harry Hubbick || Bolton Wanderers || \u00a31,000 || "]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Over the Christmas period talk was dominated by 'The Wembley of the North', which had been projected as an 80,000 capacity stadium, now it was planned as a 40,000 capacity ground with room for future expansion. Finding just fifty members for the '100 club', the financing was helped by a \u00a38,000 grant from The Football Association. In January the club initiated a fire-sale of players: Bill Pointon went to Queens Park Rangers for a then-club record five-figure fee, whilst Harry Hubbick was sold to Rochdale for around \u00a31,000. Meanwhile, the club transfer listed Palk, Aveyard, and Eric Eastwood (who all lived outside North Staffordshire); whilst Hulligan returned from injury. A two-month run without a win followed, in which Hodgson again experimented with the first eleven. This run finally ended with a 1\u20130 win over Notts County on 9 April. Nine days later at Ashton Gate, keeper Harry Prince was given a chance in place of regular George Heppell, who embarrassed himself by attempting to punch a forty-yard punt from Stone, only to miss the ball entirely and thereby concede the equalizer.
