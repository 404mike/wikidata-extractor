They did so believing that the name V. angustifolia was illegitimate, because it was a later homonym. The name \"Viola angustifolia\" had been published before Philippi described this species, in 1824 by the Swiss historian and botanist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz, writing in the famous Prodromus of Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, as a nomina nuda, a synonym of a taxon (Pigea banksiana) that is now known as Hybanthus enneaspermus. The name had been proposed on a specimen sheet collected in India, but had never been validly published. As such, the name is what is known as a pro synonymo, a name which cannot be considered as validly published because it is merely a synonymy citation. Watson and Flores were thus wrong to rename the species and V. wikipedia is thus a superfluous and illegitimate name."]}, {"page": "Erythranthe naiandina", "response": ["This species was first described by John Michael Watson and Christian von Bohlen in a paper published in 2000."]}, {"page": "J.M.Watson", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Michael Watson"]}]}}
