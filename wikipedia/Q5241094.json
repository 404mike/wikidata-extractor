He founded the huge Methodist celebration, Easter People in 1988, and was its executive Director for almost 20 years. He and some close friends had used their life-savings to fund the deposit on Camber Sands holiday camp where the first event was held. With 900 attending, it was a success, and the savings were repaid. Tens of thousands of people took part in the following years, with speakers and performers who included Dr Donald English, Adrian Plass, Simeon Wood, Rev Howard Mellor, Dr Elaine Storkey, Revd Dr David Wilkinson, Paul Field, Springs Dance Company and the Methodist Youth Brass Band.
