By 1973 the concept had run its course and Hiller formed a definite four-member line-up consisting of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens. This version of the group went on to score many hits around the world in the mid to late 1970s including \"Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby\", \"Angelo\", \"Oh Boy (The Mood I'm In)\" and \"Figaro\".
