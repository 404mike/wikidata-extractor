Three, Tom Deacon and John and David Samuel, were from Swansea RFC; with Nicholl taking the remaining position. Played at Stradey Park, the game was only decided by a goal conversion from Billy Bancroft, giving Wales the victory and Ireland the wooden spoon. From that match, Nicholl became a regular fixture in the Welsh pack. Of his 15 caps for Wales he only missed one international match over a 16-game run, taking in five Home Nations Championships. Most notably, Nicholls was part of the 1893 team which saw Wales not only win the Championship, but lift the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. The next year's tournament saw Nicholl play the first two matches against England and Scotland, but then miss the final game away to Ireland, his place taken by Neath's Fred Hutchinson. Nicholl played in all three matches of the 1895 Championship, but 1896 saw a shift in the selection tactics employed by the Welsh Rugby Union. After a humiliating defeat by England in the opening game of the 1896 Championship the selectors decided to discard many of the forward players who had served Wales over the past four seasons, including Triple Crown winners like Wallace Watts and Arthur Boucher, favouring a new type of player emerging from the South Wales coalfields. Dubbed the 'Rhondda forward', these players were selected from tough manual workers who could not only scrummage and jump, but could take and respond to a more physical game. Although a product of the university system, Nicholl was well known for his hard style of play, and survived until the end of the season but was replaced by Llwynypia's Dick Hellings in 1897."]}, {"page": "David Samuel (rugby union)", "response": ["Samuel began his rugby, like many players from Swansea, at Morriston RFC.Player profile Ospreys website By 1891 Samuel was playing for first class club Swansea, and on 7 March was selected to represent Wales against Ireland as part of the 1891 Home Nations Championship. The game saw an influx of Swansea players into the squad, with first caps for Tom Deacon, David James, Samuel's brother JohnGriffiths (1987), 4:5. as well as Samuel himself. After losses in the first two games of the tournament against Scotland and England, Wales achieved a narrow win over Ireland to avoid ending bottom of the table. Samuel was at the centre of the match scoring a vital try, which was converted by Billy Bancroft.

In 1891, as part of the Home Nations Championship, Samuel, along with his brother DavidGriffiths (1987), 4:5. was selected to represent Wales against Ireland. The team on that day was mainly made up by players from Swansea and Llanelli; Swansea provided Tom Deacon, Billy Bancroft, the two Samuel brothers and another set of brothers David and Evan James. Both Ireland and Wales had lost the previous two games of the Championship, so the encounter would decide the team to finish bottom of the table. Played at home at Llanelli's Stradey Park, Wales won the game 6\u20134, with David Samuel scoring the only Welsh try of the game. Despite the win. Samuel was not reselected for Wales again though his brother received one final cap during the Triple Crown winning 1893 Home Nations Championship."]}, {"page": "Thomas Deacon (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Tom Deacon (1868\u20131921), Wales international rugby player", "*Tom Deacon (comedian) (born 1986), English comedian and broadcaster"]}]}}
