The soundtrack was Jones' first appearance on a Who record, performing on newly written material not on the original album. The film was a critical and box office success in the UK and appealed to the growing mod revival movement. The Jam were influenced by the Who, and critics noticed a similarity between Townshend and the group's leader, Paul Weller."]}, {"page": "Quadrophenia", "response": ["Quadrophenia was revived for a film version in 1979, directed by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate visual interpretation of Townshend's vision of Jimmy and his surroundings, and included Phil Daniels as Jimmy and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the Tommy film, the music was largely relegated to the background, and was not performed by the cast as in a rock opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones' first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s."]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Moby Dick || USA Pictures / American Zoetrope / Nine Network Australia || Franc Roddam (director/screenplay); Anton Diether (screenplay); Patrick Stewart, Henry Thomas, Gregory Peck, Ted Levine, Bruce Spence, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Dominic Purcell, Norman D.
