It is not because he gave a cosmogony that John Burnet calls him the \"first man of science,\" but because he gave a naturalistic explanation of the cosmos and supported it with reasons.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 3\u20134, 18. According to tradition, Thales was able to predict an eclipse and taught the Egyptians how to measure the height of the pyramids.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 18\u201320; Herodotus, Histories, I.74.", "Thales inspired the Milesian school of philosophy and was followed by Anaximander, who argued that the substratum or arche could not be water or any of the classical elements but was instead something \"unlimited\" or \"indefinite\" (in Greek, the apeiron). He began from the observation that the world seems to consist of opposites (e.g., hot and cold), yet a thing can become its opposite (e.g., a hot thing cold). Therefore, they cannot truly be opposites but rather must both be manifestations of some underlying unity that is neither. This underlying unity (substratum, arche) could not be any of the classical elements, since they were one extreme or another. For example, water is wet, the opposite of dry, while fire is dry, the opposite of wet.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 22\u201324. This initial state is ageless and  imperishable, and everything returns to it according to necessity. Anaximenes in turn held that the arche was air, although John Burnet argues that by this, he meant that it was a transparent mist, the aether.Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 21. Despite their varied answers, the Milesian school was searching for a natural substance that would remain unchanged despite appearing in different forms, and thus represents one of the first scientific attempts to answer the question that would lead to the development of modern atomic theory; \"the Milesians,\" says Burnet, \"asked for the \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 of all things.\"Burnet, Greek Philosophy, 27.", "Sophism arose from the juxtaposition of physis (nature) and nomos (law).

According to tradition, Sophroniscus was by trade a stonemason or sculptor.p. 58, W. K. C. Guthrie, Socrates, Cambridge University Press, 1971.  Plato scholars Thomas Brickhouse and Nicholas D. Smith question the authenticity of that tradition, mainly on the grounds that the earliest extant sources of the story are comparatively late and that it is unmentioned by more reliable sources such as Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes, or Aristotle.p. 17, The Philosophy of Socrates, Westview Press, 2000.  According to John Burnet, the earliest extant mention of Socrates as a statuary or stonemason is in Timon of Philius,Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v., \"Socrates\", 1919. as quoted by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius 2.19.  Burnet claims that Timon \"is a very unsafe authority for anything\", and that the attribution \"appears to have arisen from an almost certainly false interpretation of [Socrates'] references to Daedalus as the ancestor of his family\" (in Plato's Euthyphro 11c, 15b). Burnet points out that Daedalus had nothing to do with stone-cutting or marble sculpture; his media were instead metal and wood.  Burnet furthermore argues that Xenophon and Plato would at some point have explicitly mentioned Socrates' background in stone-craftsmanship, if it were real, since both writers so often make Socrates mention craftsmen.p. 50, Plato's Euthyphro, Apology of Socrates, and Crito, Oxford University Press, 1924. Burnet cites Plato's Apology 22c9ff. and Xenophon's Memorabilia 3.10.6 as passages where the writers could not have avoided mentioning Socrates' own experience with craftsmanship if he really had any.  Another early source of the claim that Socrates was a stone-worker is Duris of Samos, who described Socrates as a slave.Cited in Diogenes La\u00ebrtius 2.19.  According to Eduard Zeller, Duris seems to have confused Socrates with Phaedo of Elis.Zeller, Socrates and the Socratic Schools, trans. O.J. Reichel (London 1877), 2nd edition, p. 60 n. 1.", "According to Plato (in the dialogue Laches), Sophroniscus was a close friend of Lysimachus, son of the illustrious Aristides the Just, which (presumably) allowed Socrates to become familiar with members of the circle of Pericles. (Since Plato has Lysimachus refer to Sophroniscus in the past tense, and since the dialogue's dramatic date is not long after the battle of Delium, we may safely infer that Sophroniscus was dead by 424.)p. 235, Debra Nails, The People of Plato, Hackett, 2002. The fact that one of Socrates' sons \u2014 but not his eldest son Lamprocles \u2014 was named after Sophroniscus suggests that Sophroniscus was the less illustrious of the two grandfathers (John Burnet 1911, Plato: Phaedo, p. 12); the father of Socrates' wife, Xanthippe, was named Lamprocles and had a more impressive pedigree than Sophroniscus. All this suggests that Socrates' inherited social status was in fact much higher than is traditionally recognized."]}, {"page": "Phaenarete", "response": ["Very little is known of the life of Phaenarete.

This statement of Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, is contradicted by Clement of Alexandria,Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, i. but the two may be reconciled by supposing that Archelaus was the first Athenian who did so. According to Simplicius,Simplicius, in Phys. Aristot. fol. 6, b. who probably got his information from Theophrastus, Archelaus was a native of Athens, even though Diogenes La\u00ebrtius says it is unclear if he was born in Athens or Miletus. He was the son of Apollodorus, or as some say, of Mydon, Midon,Suda, Archelaos or Myson; was a pupil of Anaxagoras; and is said to have taught at Lampsacus before he established himself at Athens. He is commonly reported to have taught Socrates and Euripides. If he was the instructor of Socrates, he is never mentioned by Xenophon, Plato, or Aristotle, and this story may have been an attempt to connect Socrates with the Ionian School. However, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius does report, on the authority of Ion of Chios, a contemporary of Socrates, that Socrates went with Archelaus on a trip to Samos.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ii. 23  Also, some scholars have seen in Socrates' \"autobiographical\" sketch in Plato's PhaedoPlato, Phaedo, 96b a reference to Archelaus' theory about the generation and nourishment of the first animals.John Burnet 1911, Plato: Phaedo, p. 100.

Apology 33e, Phaedo 59b. We know that after Socrates' death, Aeschines went on to write philosophical dialogues, just as Plato did, in which Socrates was main speaker. Though Aeschines' dialogues have survived only as fragments and quotations by later writers, he was renowned in antiquity for his accurate portrayal of Socratic conversations. According to John Burnet, Aeschines' style of presenting Socratic dialogue was closer to Plato's than Xenophon's.Platonism (1928), chap. II. (Some modern scholars believe that Xenophon's writings are inspired almost entirely by Plato's and/or by the influence of other Socratics such as Antisthenes and Hermogenes.e.g., Charles Kahn, Plato and the Socratic Dialogue, pp. 76-79 & 393-401 On the other hand, there is no good reason to think that Aeschines' writings were not based almost entirely on his own personal recollections of Socrates.)", "The 2nd century AD sophist Publius Aelius Aristides quotes from the Alicibiades at length, preserving for us the largest surviving chunk of Aeschines' written work. Just before World War I, Arthur Hunt recovered from Oxyrhynchus a papyrus (#1608) containing a long, fragmentary passage from this dialogue that had been lost since ancient times.John Burnet, Platonism (1928), chap. II. In the dialogue, Socrates converses with a young, ambitious Alcibiades about Themistocles and argues that Alcibiades is unprepared for a career in politics since he has failed to \"care for himself\" in such a way as to avoid thinking that he knows more than what he actually knows on matters of the most importance. Socrates seems to argue for the view that success is directly proportional to knowledge (though knowledge may not be sufficient for complete success), as opposed to being dependent merely on fortune or divine dispensation, independent of knowledge. Socrates' arguments cause the usually cocky Alcibiades to weep in shame and despair\u2014a result also attested to by Plato in the Symposium. Socrates claims that it is only through loving Alcibiades that he can improve him (by cultivating in him a desire to pursue knowledge?), since Socrates has no knowledge of his own to teach."]}, {"page": "Eric A. Havelock", "response": ["At the same time that he was becoming increasingly vocal and visible in politics, Havelock's scholarly work was moving toward the concerns that would occupy him for the bulk of his career. The first questions he raised about the relationship between literacy and orality in Greece concerned the nature of the historical Socrates, which was a long-debated issue. Havelock's position, drawn from analyses of Xenophon and Aristophanes as well as Plato himself, was that Plato's presentation of his teacher was largely a fiction, and intended to be a transparent one, whose purpose was to represent indirectly Plato's own ideas.Havelock, Eric Alfred, \"The Evidence for the Teaching of Socrates\" (Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 65. [1934], 282\u201395), 283. He argued vociferously against the idea associated with John Burnet, which still had currency at the time, that the basic model for the theory of forms originated with Socrates. Havelock's argument drew on evidence for a historical change in Greek philosophy; Plato, he argued, was fundamentally writing about the ideas of his present, not of the past.\"Teaching of Socrates\" 287. Most earlier work in the field had assumed that, since Plato uses Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in the Athens of his youth, when Socrates was his teacher. Havelock's contention that Socrates and Plato belonged to different philosophical eras was the first instance of one that would become central to his work: that a basic shift in the kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals, and the methods of discussing them, happened at some point between the end of the fifth century BC and the middle of the fourth."]}, {"page": "John Farmer (1835\u20131901)", "response": ["His daughter Mary was married to the Scottish classicist John Burnet."]}, {"page": "Pseudo-Plutarch", "response": ["*The Doctrines of the Philosophers (; Latin: Placita Philosophorum)The writer of this work depended on the (lost) work of the Peripatetic philosopher Aetius (see John Burnet (3rd edition, 1920), Early Greek Philosophy: Section B: Note on the Sources )."]}, {"page": "John Burnet", "response": ["John Burnet may refer to:", "* John Burnet (MP) (by 1527\u201357/59), MP for Arundel", "* John Burnet (painter) (1781\u20131868), Scottish engraver and painter", "* John Burnet (abolitionist) (1789\u20131862), pastor in Camberwell", "* John Burnet (architect) (1814\u20131901), Scottish architect", "* John Burnet (classicist) (1863\u20131928), Scottish classicist who wrote Early Greek Philosophy", "*John Burnett (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Edward J.
