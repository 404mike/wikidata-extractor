Dot's Story of Grime, a documentary for BBC Three following her attempt to get the biggest names in grime to clash in a cypher called Grimeageddon, royal rumble style. First she attended the 2016 Red Bull Culture Clash, a sound clash competition featuring the biggest names in hip hop, dancehall, grime, and garage, to give a mainstream example of what she wants, but with less glitz and glam. She then goes back to grime clashing roots by meeting Lord of the Mics co-founders Ratty and Jammer at Jammer's childhood family home. She attended the 2016 Bestival festival. She interviewed Logan Sama, DJ Target, NoLay, Sian Anderson, Wiley, AJ Tracey, Jammz, Ghetts, President T, Sir Spyro, Chantelle Fiddy and GRM Daily founder Posty, to get their advice and opinions on what she's trying to do, plus get some of them involved. She goes to meet rapper Devilman in Birmingham, but he doesn't turn up. She interviews Bradfordians including videographer James Guy, producer Rubix Cube, rappers Blazer Boccle, Wrapz, and Mic Man Sparxxx, along with Huddersfield rapper Jahrel Mission, in Rubix's Thornton, Bradford based music studio. The Bradfordians give their views on rappers up North, clashing and grime in general. The Grimeageddon cypher involved the Wolverhampton rapper Raider, Kilburn rapper Big Zuu, along with cousins Shizz McNaughty and Discarda from Bow battling it out. Logan Sama deejayed for the cypher, while the West Yorkshire boys James, Rubix, Blazer, Wrapz, Mic Man, Jahrel, and D-Lo from Bradford watched on, before finally getting a go on the mic at the end."]}, {"page": "Aruba Red", "response": ["After taking a hiatus from making music professionally, losing her father and becoming a mother, on 31 August 2018, Aruba Red made her comeback releasing an EP entitled \"Holy Waters\" independently via Ditto Music.
