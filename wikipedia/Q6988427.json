Other pieces were acquired from the National Trust's extensive collections, and notable antiques that had a long-standing association with the property were also bought for display in the house. Many historians have criticised Fowler's design choices at Clandon House. Merlin Waterson admits \"he was not given clear enough guidance on what was historically appropriate\". However, Neil Cossons, a historian and museum director, has noted \"[Fowler] was ever anxious to avoid the \"dead hand of the restorer\". In these interiors nothing jarred and they were completely in keeping with the romantc taste of the period\". In 1978, a parterre designed by John Fowler and Paul Miles was laid out on the south front, replacing early 20th-century flower beds."]}, {"page": "Jewellery Quarter", "response": ["In 2000, Sir Neil Cossons announced that the Newman Brothers Coffin Furniture Factory would be given Grade II* listed status.
