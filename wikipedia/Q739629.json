He was nicknamed \"Peerless Pennington\".\nBorn in West Bromwich, Pennington was a left-back for West Bromwich Albion for 19 years, from March 1903 to May 1922. Although his career was interrupted by World War I, Pennington made 455 league appearances for the club, captaining them to the league title in 1919\u20131920. He had also been a part of the team promoted from the Second Division in 1911 and had received an FA Cup runners-up medal in 1912.\nDuring World War I, with regular league play suspended, Pennington was employed in Coventry to work in a munitions factory. While in the city he made a number of guest appearances for Coventry City in the 1918\u201319 Football League Midland Section, a temporary wartime division operating while the main league was suspended.On the international front, Pennington earned 25 caps for England between 18 March 1907 and 10 April 1920, captaining the side in his last two matches. At the time of his final cap he was, at 36 years and 231 days, England's oldest capped outfield player. This record has since been exceeded by Stanley Matthews, Leslie Compton and Stuart Pearce.\nAfter retiring, he worked as a scout for West Bromwich Albion from 1950 to 1960 and was made a life member of the club in 1969, a year before he died in Kidderminster. Pennington was named as one of West Bromwich Albion's 16 greatest players in a poll organised as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004.Until the shop was bought by the Co-operative in 1934, Pennington also owned a fishing tackle shop at 33 Smethwick High Street, where his family had lived since 1911.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Bromwich Albion F.C.", "response": ["Albion's most capped international player, taking into account only those caps won whilst at the club, is Chris Brunt.

They finished thirteenth in 1912\u201313 and financial pressure led to the cutting of the professional staff form 24 to 18. The following season they finished bottom of the league and were relegated to division two of the Southern League. The quality of teams was much lower and Coventry had some big victories in the 1914\u201315 season but the finances of the club were once more in grave danger. The club tried unsuccessfully to join the Football League's second division and came close to extinction in the summer of 1915. They were saved in part by the decision to abandon the upcoming FA Cup and Southern League seasons because of World War I. Although no football was played for the next few years City still had liabilities and in 1917 had to be rescued by David Cooke, who paid off the debts and began replenishing the club's staff. Seeking to make the step up to the Football League after the war, the club played regular friendly matches against local clubs such as Aston Villa during 1918 and then negotiated a place for itself in the 1918\u201319 Football League Midland Section, a temporary wartime division operating while the main league was suspended. The rules allowed guest players and City made use of two internationals based in Coventry during the war \u2013 England's Jesse Pennington and Scotland's George Chaplin. The division was somewhat amateurish due to the absence of many players but Coventry acquitted themselves well, winning games against top-flight Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday, and Huddersfield Town. In early 1919 they made a speculative application for league status and were successful, topping the ballot and gaining entry to the second division when full-time football restarted in 1919\u201320."]}, {"page": "List of West Bromwich Albion F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Most capped player for England: Jesse Pennington, 25 caps as an Albion playerMatthews (2007) pp. 404\u2013408."]}, {"page": "Pennington (surname)", "response": ["* Jesse Pennington (1883\u20131970), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1913\u201314 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["In November 1913, Birmingham captain Womack was offered an inducement of \u00a355 to fix the result of the match against Grimsby Town.
