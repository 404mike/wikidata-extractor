Most of his life he worked for the family company, Gonz\u00e1lez Byass, where he increased its exports to a worldwide level. His family estate was located in the wetland region called Do\u00f1ana in southern Spain and was threatened by drainage efforts in the early 1950s. Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon with the help of researchers and international support managed to preserve the site, while at the same time donating some of his family land to the conservation effort. Afterward, Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon became one of the founders of the Spanish Ornithological Society in 1954. His conservation efforts for Do\u00f1ana culminated in the creation of the Do\u00f1ana National Park in 1969. The area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.", "link_mentions": {}}}
