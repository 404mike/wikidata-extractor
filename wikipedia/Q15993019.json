Most of his life he worked for the family company, Gonz\u00e1lez Byass, where he increased its exports to a worldwide level. His family estate was located in the wetland region called Do\u00f1ana in southern Spain and was threatened by drainage efforts in the early 1950s. Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon with the help of researchers and international support managed to preserve the site, while at the same time donating some of his family land to the conservation effort. Afterward, Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon became one of the founders of the Spanish Ornithological Society in 1954. His conservation efforts for Do\u00f1ana culminated in the creation of the Do\u00f1ana National Park in 1969. The area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Do\u00f1ana National Park", "response": ["The Spanish businessman Mauricio Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon y D\u00edez, Marquis of Bonanza, whose family owned a large estate in Do\u00f1ana, became interested in its ecosystems and their birdlife, and invited ornithologists from all over Europe to visit. In 1952, the Spanish ornithologists Jos\u00e9 Antonio Valverde and Francisco Bernis visited the property, with Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon serving as their guide. Valverde and the Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon family saw that the wetlands, with their richly diverse wildlife, were threatened by the Spanish government's proposals to drain them for farming and the planting of eucalyptus trees. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning the plans. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel. By November 1953 Bernis had finished a report on the status of the Do\u00f1ana which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought and obtained international support for their goals. The efforts of Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted."]}, {"page": "List of ornithologists", "response": ["*Mauricio Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon y D\u00edez \u2013 Spain"]}, {"page": "Gonz\u00e1lez (surname)", "response": ["* Mauricio Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon y D\u00edez (1923\u20132013), Spanish sherry maker and conservationist"]}, {"page": "Gonz\u00e1lez Byass", "response": ["In 1963 they constructed the great T\u00edo Pepe bodega, holding 28,000 butts and built on 3 floors.
