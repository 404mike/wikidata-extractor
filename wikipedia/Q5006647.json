It was a 3ft 6in gauge plateway, reliant on horse traction. It ran to Watton, where there was a wharf on the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal. Although this considerably improved communications to and from Hay, the advance of railway technology eventually left the Hay Railway behind, and in 1859 the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway (HH&BR) was authorised. It agreed a purchase of the Hay Railway in order to convert it to an edge railway with locomotive traction. The proposal was ratified by the Hay Railway Act of 6 August 1860. The HH&BR opened its line to Hay in 1864. The HH&BR was later taken over by the Midland Railway.C R Clinker, Railways to Brecon - 2, in the Railway Magazine, June 1960Gwyn Briwnant Jones and Denis Dunstone, The Origins of the LMS in South Wales, Gomer Press, Ceredigion, 1999, Charles Loch Mowat, The Golden Valley Railway, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1964"]}, {"page": "Interwar Britain", "response": ["British policy was confused and contradictory, as the cabinet could not decide on war or peace, sending in enough force to commit atrocities that angered Catholics in Ireland and America, and Liberals in Britain, but not enough to suppress the rebels outside the cities.

He sent in 40,000 soldiers as well as newly formed para-military units\u2014the \"Black and Tans\" and the Auxiliaries\u2014to reinforce the professional police (the Royal Irish Constabulary). British firepower prevailed in the cities forcing the Irish Republican Army (IRA) (the paramilitary force of Sinn F\u00e9in) into hiding. However the IRA controlled much of the countryside and set up an alternative local government.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the Wars (1955) pp. 58\u201372.

The dairy industry was producing too much, and profits were too low. So the government used the Milk Marketing Board to give a guaranteed price to dairy farmers \u2013 a policy ridiculed by The Economist as the \"economics of Bedlam.\"Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918\u20131940 (1955) p. 439. Food prices were low, but the advantage went overwhelmingly to the middle and upper classes, with the poorest third of the population suffering from sustained poor nutrition. Starvation was not a factor, but widespread hunger was. The deleterious effects on poor children were obvious to teachers. In 1934, the government began a program of charging school children a halfpenny a day for a third of a pint of milk. This dramatically improved their nutrition, and the new demand kept up the wholesale price of milk paid to farmers. About half the nation's school children participated by 1936. Milk was distributed for free in the Second World War, and participation rose to 90 percent. Indeed, the rationing system of the wartime years sharply improved the nutrition of poorest third, together with their capacity for manual labour.Branson and Heinemann, Britain in the 1930s (1971) pp. 202\u201320.", "By summer 1931 the world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of \u00a32\u00bd million a day.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918\u20131940 (1955) pp. 379-385.David Williams, \"London and the 1931 financial crisis.\" Economic History Review 15.3 (1963): 513\u2013528. Credits of \u00a325 million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of \u00a315 million in fiduciary notes slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but the King insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition \"National government.\" The Conservative and Liberal parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister of a largely Conservative coalition.C. L.
