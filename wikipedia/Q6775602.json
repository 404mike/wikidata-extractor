Halstead secured some publicity in 2005 when, at the age of 18, he announced that he would launch his own aviation business. Halstead's 2005 business was called AlphaOne Airways.  It had a number of false starts. Halstead announced services from Oxford in March 2005 and later the same year from Southampton Airport. AlphaOne Airways never flew a single flight from either airport.  In December 2005 and January 2006, a limited flight programme took place between Isle of Man and Edinburgh.  The business folded after having carried only 46 passengers."]}, {"page": "Alpha One Airways", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martin Halstead#Alpha One Airways"]}, {"page": "Halstead (name)", "response": ["* Martin Halstead (born 1986), English company director and pilot"]}, {"page": "Halstead, Martin", "response": ["#redirectMartin Halstead"]}]}}
