He has been Tony nominated for his play 'Fortune's Fool' along with his adaptations of 'Wolf Hall' and 'Bring Up the Bodies'.\nPoulton began his career in 1995 with Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and Ivan Turgenev's Fortune's Fool, which were staged at the Chichester Festival Theatre, the former with Derek Jacobi, the latter with Alan Bates. Bates reprised his role for a 2002 Broadway production that earned Poulton a Tony Award nomination for Best Play.Poulton's subsequent works include Chekov's Three Sisters, The Cherry Orchard,  and The Seagull, Euripides' Ion, Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Ghosts, August Strindberg's The Father and Dance of Death.\nHis adaptation of Friedrich von Schiller's Don Carlos was performed at the Chichester and in the West End with Derek Jacobi. Charlotte Loveridge has written, \"Mike Poulton's new translation has superb lucidity and pace. Purging Schiller of any hint of verbosity or bombast, the text is full of deft shifts of register from the boldly poetic to the colloquial. As Posa asks the king, \"You wish to plant a garden that will flower forever./Why do you water it with blood?\" Unafraid to employ vocabulary with contemporary significance, the translation nevertheless does not dogmatically confine the meaning of the play to an exclusively modern interpretation.\"Mary Stuart was performed at Clwyd Theatr Cymru and Wallenstein at  Chichester. Other adaptations include Chaucer's Canterbury Tales for the Royal Shakespeare Company which was presented at the Gielgud Theatre from July to September 2006,  and two plays based on Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur.\nPoulton's adaptations have been presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, the Mercury Theatre, Colchester, the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, on Broadway, in the West End, and even in York Minster.\nPoulton translated Fredrick von Schiller's Kabale und Liebe for a new production called Luise Miller, at the Donmar Warehouse in London, from 8 June to 30 July 2011, starring Felicity Jones.Poulton premiered a new adaptation of Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken at London's The Print Room in 2011. Re-titled Judgement Day, the production was directed by James Dacre and starred Michael Pennington and Penny Downie.\nHis adaptation of Turgenev's Fortune's Fool was revived in the West End at The Old Vic in December 2013. The production was directed by Lucy Bailey and starred Iain Glen (later replaced by Patrick Cremin and Will Houston) and Richard McCabe.His adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities premieres at the Royal & Derngate in Northampton in February 2014. It features original music by Rachel Portman and is directed by James Dacre in his first in-house production since becoming those theatres' artistic director in July 2013.\nPoulton's adaptations of Hilary Mantel's historical novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies for the Royal Shakespeare Company premi\u00e8red at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in January 2014, at the Aldwych Theatre in London in May 2014 and at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre in March 2015.

With Ray Stevenson in the role of Christ and Rory Mulvihill (Jesus in 1996) as Satan, the production was the most expensive and wide-reaching project in the history of the plays' modern revival. The first half began in heaven with the story of the fall of Lucifer, followed by the creation of the world, the fall of Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark (with impressive and memorable representations of the animals and the flood) and the story of Abraham and Isaac. From the New Testament there came the annunciation and nativity of Jesus, the massacre of the innocents, Christ's childhood, baptism, temptation and ministry, and his entrance into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. The second half concentrated on the capture and trial of Christ, and his crucifixion, resurrection and ascension. The production ended, as is traditional, with the Last Judgement.York Millennium Mystery Plays: Programme", "In 2016 the plays were performed in York Minster from 26 May, the feast of Corpus Christi, until 30 June. The director, Phillip Breen, had previously directed for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production featured a large step set by designers Max Jones and Ruth Hall, that was dissected by a thin gauze that reached to the vaulted ceiling, which was utilised as a projection screen by projection designer Douglas O'Connell.  Writer Mike Poulton and composer Richard Shephard repeated their millennium production roles. The cast had about 150 amateur actors and the sole professional, Philip McGinley, played Jesus except for the last four performances, when,  owing to his sudden illness, the role was taken by his understudy Toby Gordon who had, up to then, played Satan. This caused a cascade of understudying which was superbly handled by a committed cast.
