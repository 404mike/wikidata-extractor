Manchester United purchased Spence from Scotswood in March 1919. His first game for the club came on 30 August 1919 against Derby County, at the start of the first Football League season after the First World War.\nHe scored 168 goals and made 510 appearances for Manchester United; at the time of his departure in 1933, both were club records. He was eventually overtaken by Jack Rowley as the club's top goalscorer in 1952, while his appearances record stood until November 1964, when he was surpassed by Bill Foulkes\nOne of United's few true stars between the wars, Spence's wing play made \"Give it to Joe\" the most commonly heard terrace chant during his 14 years at Old Trafford. His first season brought 14 goals in 32 First Division games, and in his best season at the club, 1927-28 season, he scored 24 goals; 22 in the league and two in the FA Cup. However, United were relegated to the Second Division twice during his 14 years there.", "link_mentions": {}}}
