An early header from Wrexham's prolific striker Dixie McNeil went wide of Pat Jennings' post and 25 minutes in, Macdonald tapped home after Stapleton's header was parried by Wrexham goalkeeper Eddie Niedzwiecki.  Wrexham increased their tempo and were denied by the referee as he disallowed a Bobby Shinton goal for offside.  The Welsh side equalised midway through the second half, with a McNeil header, his eleventh goal of his FA Cup campaign.  Arsenal quickly retook the lead through a Sunderland header, and extended it to 3\u20131 in the 73rd minute after a Liam Brady slice was delicately finished by Willie Young.  Graham Whittle pulled one back for Wrexham with ten minutes to go but the match ended 3\u20132 and Arsenal were through.  The semi-final, played at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge as a neutral venue, was against lower-league Orient who had already knocked out First Division teams Norwich City, Chelsea and Middlesbrough.  Arsenal took the lead in the fifteenth minute through a deflected Macdonald strike, and doubled their advantage three minutes later as Macdonald scored again, this time courtesy of a deflection by Orient defender Glenn Roeder.  Graham Rix extended the North London club's lead midway through the second half to see Arsenal into the final as 3\u20130 victors."]}]}}
