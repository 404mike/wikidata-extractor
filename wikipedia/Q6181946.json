More specifically he has published books on Blake, Dickens and the nineteenth-century and cities within literature. Publication of his book Opera and the Culture of Fascism (1996) was met by a number of distressed voices from the operatic world.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Happy Together (1997 film)", "response": ["Wong Kar-wai explained that: \"In fact, I don't like people to see this film as a gay film. It's more like a story about human relationships and somehow the two characters involved are both men. Normally I hate movies with labels like 'gay film,\u2019 'art film' or 'commercial film.' There is only good film and bad film.\"On the other hand, some scholars argue that one of the reasons that Po-Wing and Fai ended up in Buenos Aires is because they are gay and are thus exiled queer men. Jeremy Tambling, an author and critic, noted that the universalization of the gay relationship is not a positive aspect of the film because it erases the specificity of their experiences and the film's theme of marginalization. Furthermore, the film broadly portrays neo-Confucian values of hard work, frugality, and normativity, highlighting its lack of queerness and emphasis of heteronormativity. Fai is rewarded for following these values, as he works constantly, cooks, cares for others, wants to reconcile with his father, and saves his money, while Po-Wing lives in excess through his numerous sexual encounters, spending, lack of traditional work, and flamboyance. At the end of the film, Fai is able to reach his destination, Hong Kong/Taiwan and the Iguazu Falls, while Po-Wing is stuck in Buenos Aires. Chang also represents these values, as he works hard at the restaurant, saves enough money for his trip to the 'end of the world,' and has a loving family to return to in Taipei. The characters who conform to this normativity are rewarded while others are punished, thus emphasizing a \"straight\" narrative."]}, {"page": "Judith Weir", "response": ["*HEAVEN ABLAZE in His Breast (5 October 1989, Basildon), based on E.T.A.
