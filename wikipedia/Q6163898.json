This church has a remarkable collection of glass by Arts and Crafts artists including three stained glass windows by Whall. These include \"The Good Shepherd\" of 1902 and the \"Resurrection\".  \"The Good Shepherd\" is the East window and depicts Christ as the Good Shepherd, with quotations from Psalm 23 in the surrounding scenes.  The window was commissioned by Mr.Leonard Davies in memory of his brother Herbert Davies and the black-faced sheep in the scenes were drawn by Whall's sister-in-law, Alice Chaplin, who was sculptress to Queen Victoria.  It is recorded that the sheep depicted are exact portraits of sheep in the pedigree flock owned by Mr.Davies. The Whall window on the South side of the church is that depicting the \"Resurrection\".  Note the symbolic \"fish nimbus\" which surrounds the figure of Christ.  Whall also designed the window at the back of the choir, this in memory of the late Dr.Image, the uncle of Selwyn Image, a fellow stained glass artist and friend of Whall. Also in St Ethelbert is the window titled \"Come unto Me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" this done by Jasper Brett, a pupil of Christopher Whall. The church also has two stained glass windows which contain no figures but are studies of Herringswell in Spring and Autumn. They are by the artist James ClarkJames Clark (1858-1943) is perhaps best known for his First World War painting of 1918 entitled \"Duty\" or \"A Great Sacrifice\".His window \"The Rich Man's Feast\" of 1898 is held at the Stained Glass Museum in Ely  The church also has a window by Paul Woodroffe another pupil of Whall."]}, {"page": "List of Ireland national rugby union team records", "response": ["| 10. || Jasper Brett || 18 years 218 days || 8 August 1895 || 14 March 1914 || "]}]}}
