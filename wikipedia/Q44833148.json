Other recent work includes the Anglo-Austrian \u201cStonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project\", The Curious Travellers Project, the Adriatic islands Project, and the pit alignment at Warren Fields  He was Co-PI on the EPSRC GG-TOP Gravity Gradient Project.

Optically stimulated luminescence tests revealed that soil within the pits had not been exposed to daylight since 2400BC. Examination of the pits demonstrated they were in use from the late neolithic until the middle bronze age.

From October 2007, he was employed as a lecturer in Archaeological Geophysics at the University of Bradford, and is currently Head of the School of Archaeological and Forensic Sciences. As part of the School, Gaffney was active in founding, with Andrew Wilson, Bradford Visualisation in 2013. Bradford Visualisation (BradViz), is a research group dedicated to establishing digital methods and visualisation as an integral part of archaeological research at Bradford. The group has grown significantly since 2013 and is now managed by Gaffney, Wilson, and Vincent Gaffney.  Key research projects associated with Bradford Visualisation and Gaffney include \"Fragmented Heritage\", \"Digitised Diseases\", \"From Cemetery to Clinic\" and \"Augmenting Jordanian Heritage.\""]}, {"page": "Vincent Gaffney", "response": ["Vincent Gaffney  (born 25 February 1958) is a British archaeologist and the Anniversary Chair in Landscape Archaeology at the University of Bradford.", "* Vincent Gaffney's Academia page with extensive bibliographic information "]}]}}
