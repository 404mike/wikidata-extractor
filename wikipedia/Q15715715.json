Although a public disagreement on secondary matters might be serious enough, it has often only led to religious discrimination. A public renunciation of the core elements of a religious doctrine under the same circumstances would, on the other hand, have put one in far greater danger. While dissenters from the official Church only faced fines and imprisonment in Protestant England, six people were executed for heresy or blasphemy during the reign of Elizabeth I, and two more were executed in 1612 under James I.John Coffey (2000), p. 26", "By contrast to the notion of civil tolerance, in early modern Europe the subjects were required to attend the state church; This attitude can be described as territoriality or religious uniformity, and its underlying assumption is brought to a point by a statement of the Anglican theologian Richard Hooker: \"There is not any man of the Church of England but the same man is also a member of the [English] commonwealth; nor any man a member of the commonwealth, which is not also of the Church of England.\"The Works of Richard Hooker, II, p. 485; quoted after: John Coffey (2000), p. 33", "The most ambitious chronicle of that time is W.K.Jordan's magnum opus The Development of Religious Toleration in England, 1558\u20131660 (four volumes, published 1932\u20131940). Jordan wrote as the threat of fascism rose in Europe, and this work is seen as a defense of the fragile values of humanism and tolerance.Coffey 2000, 2 More recent introductions to this period are Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England, 1558\u20131689 (2000) by John Coffey and Charitable hatred.

To understand why religious persecution has occurred, historians like Coffey \"pay close attention to what the persecutors said they were doing.\"", "No religion is free from internal dissent, although the degree of dissent that is tolerated within a particular religious organization can strongly vary. This degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church is described as ecclesiastical tolerance,John Coffey (2000), p. 12 and is one form of religious toleration. However, when people nowadays speak of religious tolerance, they most often mean civil tolerance, which refers to the degree of religious diversity that is tolerated within the state.", "In the Christian debate on persecution and toleration, the notion of civil tolerance allowed Christian theologians to reconcile Jesus' commandment to love one's enemies with other parts of the New Testament that are rather strict regarding dissent within the church. Before that, theologians like Joseph Hall had reasoned from the ecclesiastical intolerance of the early Christian church in the New Testament to the civil intolerance of the Christian state.John Coffey (2000), p. 33", "Although his book was written before the September 11 attacks, John Coffey explicitly compares the English fear of the Popish Plot to Islamophobia in the contemporary Western world.\"Like the extremist Islamic clerics who today provide inspiration for terrorist campaigns, the [Catholic] priests could not be treated like men who only sought the spiritual nourishment of the flock.\" Coffey 2000: 38&39.

During this time, Calvinist clergy held the best bishoprics and deaneries. Historians John Coffey and Paul C. H. Lim write that the Elizabethan Church \"was widely regarded as a Reformed church, but it was anomalous in retaining certain features of late medieval Catholicism\", such as cathedrals, church choirs, a formal liturgy contained in the Prayer Book, traditional clerical vestments and episcopal polity."]}, {"page": "History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance", "response": ["By the time of the English Revolution, Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. While accepting their zeal in desiring a \"godly society\", some contemporary historians doubt whether the English Puritans during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work emphasizes the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, Catholicism, non-Christian religions, and even atheism.COFFEY, J.
