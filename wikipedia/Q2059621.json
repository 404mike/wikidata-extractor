For example, a scientist can look at a molecular model of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the Journal of Multimedia. One well known example of this being applied would be in the movie Interstellar where Executive Director Kip Thorne helped create one of the most realistic depictions of a blackhole in film. The visual effects team under Paul Franklin took Kip Thorne's mathematical data and applied it into their own visual effects engine called \"Double Negative Gravitational Renderer (DNGR)\" a.k.a \"Gargantua\", to create a \"real\" blackhole, used in the final cut. Later on the visual effects team went onto publish a blackhole study"]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Visual Effects", "response": ["|Nick Davis, Chris Corbould, Tim Webber and Paul Franklin", "| Paul Franklin, Chris Corbould, Andrew Lockley, and Peter Bebb", "| Paul Franklin, Andrew Lockley, Ian Hunter, and Scott R.

According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception. However, for Interstellar they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens. Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 \u00d7 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production.
