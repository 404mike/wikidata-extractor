He averaged 23.77 with the bat throughout the series, making just one half-century. Bairstow was dropped from England's Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, with England selector Ed Smith saying 'He does drop out of the Test squad for these two Tests in New Zealand, which are not part of the World Test Championship, and I predict he'll come back stronger for having had a bit of time away from the Test set-up', leaving open the possibility of a return, amidst calls for Bairstow to work on his technique in red ball cricket. Bairstow returned to the team as a cover for the unwell Ollie Pope, making 9 and 25 before again being dropped from the side on Pope's return. Bairstow was already in South Africa at a training camp working on his red ball technique. He was then dropped from the squad for England's tour of Sri Lanka in favour of Keaton Jennings, which was criticised by some in the media as too 'short-term' an approach."]}, {"page": "Shardul Thakur", "response": ["Thakur was included in the India squad for the 2021 England tour.

Thakur finished the series with 117 runs at 39 with the bat, while claiming seven wickets at 22 with the ball.
