But according to James Tait, contemporary English sources that describe the conspiracy make no mention of Edward, and his role in it is open to question."]}, {"page": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham", "response": ["Humphrey Stafford married Lady Anne Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland and Lady Joan Beaufort (Westmorland's second wife), at some point before 18 October 1424. Anne Neville was a literary patron in her own right, also receiving a dedication in a copy of Scrope's translated Othea. On her death in 1480, she left many books in her will. Scholars generally agree that Buckingham and Anne had twelve children, consisting of seven sons and five daughters. Sources conflict over the precise details of the Staffords' progeny. The antiquarian I. W. Dunham, writing in 1907, listed them as Humphrey, Henry, John, Anne (married Aubrey de Vere), Joana (married Viscount Beaumont before 1461), Elizabeth, Margaret (born about 1435, married Robert Dinham), and Katherine (married John Talbot, the future 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, before 1467).  James Tait lists the daughters as Anne, Joanna, Elizabeth, Margaret and Catherine and suggests that Elizabeth and Margaret never married. Rawcliffe gives the following as dates of birth and death for three of the daughters: Anne, 1446\u20131472; Joan, 1442\u20131484; and Katherine, 1437\u20131476. Edward and the twins, George and William, died young. The seventh son has gone unremarked in the sources.The marriages Buckingham arranged for his children were structured around strengthening his ties to the Lancastrian royal family. Of particular importance were the marriages of two of his sons, Humphrey and Henry. They married into the Beaufort family, which was descended from the illegitimate children of John of Gaunt and thus of royal blood. There was also, about 1450, discussion regarding a proposal for one of Buckingham's daughters to marry the Dauphin of France (subsequently Louis XI). Had it proceeded, it would have again linked the French Crown with the Lancastrian regime."]}, {"page": "Wilmslow", "response": ["* James Tait (1863 \u2013 1944 in Wilmslow) an English medieval historian, noted for his retiring, scholarly life in Wilmslow."]}, {"page": "Thomas Tout", "response": ["In 1890, Tout left Lampeter and became professor of history at Owens College, Manchester, (a constituent college of the Victoria University) where he stayed until 1925 (this changed to the University of Manchester in 1903). In 1894 he failed to gain the chair at Glasgow. Tout was, with James Tait, one of the two leading figures of the 'Manchester History School', and is best known for his 6-volume Chapters in the Administrative History of Medieval England, whose influence still remains and was for 40 years magisterial in the shaping of late medieval English History scholarship. Concentrating, through close study of the Crown's administrative records, on how changes of government-method reflected changes in the nature of power and politics, the work stood the test of 19th-century constitutional history and mid-20th-century socio-political emphasis with very few fundamental criticisms of Tout's methods and conclusions. Other works included The Political History of England, 1216\u20131377 (1905) and The Place of the Reign of Edward II in English History (1914), comprising the Ford Lectures at Oxford University in 1913. Tout published a heavily revised second edition in 1926. Tout was also prolific in writing short, sharp articles about the significance of particular documents he had found, most of which still stand up impressively. He was president of the Royal Historical Society from 1925 to 1929. He was a member of the Chetham Society, and served as a member of Council from 1907 to 1929.", "Tout is, moreover, also thought to be responsible for the appointment of the first female academic at Manchester University. Alice Margaret Cooke joined his department as a lecturer in 1893.Alice Margaret Cooke, Manchester University, Retrieved 5 January 2016 A sign of both Tout's interest in encouraging women to pursue academic careers and his commitment to primary research is displayed as early as 1902.  In that year, with his colleague James Tait, he edited a volume of \"Manchester Essays\" displaying the scholarly work being done at the new university.  As editors, the two men collected papers from young scholars as well as from some senior Manchester figures.  They included work by several women and--in keeping with a long-term interest of Tout--they published papers on teaching history in the secondary schools. Tout's interest in how history was taught at pre-university levels is also borne out by his many years on the governing board of the Historical Association, with its dedication to bridging the gap between academic research and the teaching of history.", "He married Mary Johnstone and lived at 14 Mauldeth Road, on the Fallowfield/Withington border, and later moved to 1 Oak Drive, Fallowfield.

He moved with his family to London, and was educated at Highgate School from 1902 to 1906. The family then moved to Manchester, where he attended Manchester University from 1907, and where his lecturers included Maurice Powicke, Thomas Frederick Tout and James Tait. Galbraith would later write the biographical articles on Tout and Tait for the Dictionary of National Biography. Another historian who influenced him was H. W. C. Davis. Galbraith was awarded a first class in modern history by the University in 1910, and won a Brackenbury scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford, he won the Stanhope prize in 1911 with an essay on the chronicles of St Albans, achieved a third class in literae humaniores in 1913, and a first class in modern history in 1914."]}, {"page": "Publication of Domesday Book", "response": ["J.

William Robert Whatton disputed this, believing the origin and descent of the Gresle family to be separate to that of the Derbyshire baronets, noting the distinct armorial bearings, and noting that there is no record of the Gresleys holding land in Lancashire.
