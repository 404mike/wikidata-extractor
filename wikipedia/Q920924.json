The portraits were produced as watercolours and turned into chromolithographs for publication in the magazine. These were then usually reproduced on better paper and sold as prints.  Such was his influence in the genre that all Vanity Fair caricatures are sometimes referred to as \"Spy cartoons\" regardless of who the artist actually was.\nEarly portraits, almost always full-length (judges at the bench being the main exception), had a stronger element of caricature and usually distorted the proportions of the body, with a very large head and upper body supported on much smaller lower parts.  Later, as he became socially accepted in the society in which he moved to gain access to his subjects, and not wishing to cause offence, his style developed into what he called \"characteristic portraits\", being less of a caricature and more of an actual portrait of the subject, using realistic body proportions.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edwin Austin Abbey", "response": ["File:Edwin Austin Abbey Vanity Fair 29 December 1898.jpg|Edwin Austin Abbey (1898), by Leslie Ward, Vanity Fair, 29 December 1898."]}, {"page": "William Crookes", "response": ["File:Sir William Crookes 1902.jpg|Sir William Crookes by Sir Leslie Ward, 1902"]}, {"page": "1922", "response": ["* May 15 \u2013 Leslie Ward, English portrait artist, caricaturist (b. 1851)"]}, {"page": "List of pseudonyms", "response": ["|Leslie Ward"]}, {"page": "William Gillette", "response": ["In 1907 Gillette was caricatured in Vanity Fair by Sir Leslie Ward (who signed his work \"Spy\") (see above),\"Sherlock Holmes\", Vanity Fair, February 27, 1907, Front Cover and later became the subject of such famous American caricaturists as Pamela Colman Smith,Smith, Pamela Colman, William Gillette As Sherlock Holmes (R.
