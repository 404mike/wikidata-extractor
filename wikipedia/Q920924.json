The portraits were produced as watercolours and turned into chromolithographs for publication in the magazine. These were then usually reproduced on better paper and sold as prints.  Such was his influence in the genre that all Vanity Fair caricatures are sometimes referred to as \"Spy cartoons\" regardless of who the artist actually was.\nEarly portraits, almost always full-length (judges at the bench being the main exception), had a stronger element of caricature and usually distorted the proportions of the body, with a very large head and upper body supported on much smaller lower parts.  Later, as he became socially accepted in the society in which he moved to gain access to his subjects, and not wishing to cause offence, his style developed into what he called \"characteristic portraits\", being less of a caricature and more of an actual portrait of the subject, using realistic body proportions.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
