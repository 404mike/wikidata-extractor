In The Game, each individual assumes the role of a member in a \"happy\" family, completely subsuming his or her individual personality to the point that each individual is known only by the identity he or she is playing: Mumsy (the mother, Ursula Howells), Nanny (the nanny, Pat Heywood), Sonny (the son, played by Howard Trevor), and Girly (the daughter, Vanessa Howard). The Game is built around a set of strictly enforced yet ill-defined rules, the principal one of which is \"Rule No. 1: Play the Game.\"", "Owing to the film's origins as a stage production, Francis largely filled out the cast with experienced stage performers who had made the transition to film, such as Ursula Howells, Pat Heywood, and Michael Bryant. The zookeeper whom Sonny and Girly harass in the film's opening sequence was played by Michael Ripper, a regular in Hammer Horror films whom Francis knew from his time working for the studio. Howard Trevor, who played Sonny, had only a single prior screen credit, on an episode of the anthology series ITV Playhouse; Girly would prove to be his only film role. Vanessa Howard, who had also gotten her start on ITV, was a relative newcomer who had starred in four films prior to Girly; she performed so well that it was decided in post production that she would become the centerpiece of the film's marketing campaign, with the intention of turning the film into a star vehicle for her.", "In an attempt to recoup losses, the film was rebranded for release in the United States, where exploitation films were enjoying moderate success. Retitled simply Girly, the film's advertising campaign was retooled to be built exclusively around Vanessa Howard, removing all of her costars from the film's posters. The film performed surprisingly well, even achieving a positive writeup in Variety.", "The film's failure at the British box office led to Vanessa Howard's decision to retire from acting in 1972; at the time of her decision, she was unaware of the film's success in America, and remained uninformed for some time.Cinema X Magazine, Vol. 4, No. 11 Despite the film's financial failure, Francis maintained for the rest of his life that it had been his best work, and his personal favourite of all the films he made.", "The film disappeared from cinemas in America and England for several years. The film was subsequently released to VHS in North America (again under the title of Girly); copies proved difficult to obtain in the United Kingdom, as the organizers of a Freddie Francis film festival in 2004 were unable to turn up a print or VHS copy of the film to screen. Around 2006, bootleg copies of the film began to surface on the internet. Shortly thereafter, Salvation Films announced that they had obtained the rights to release Girly on DVD. The release entered development hell, with Salvation promising the film's upcoming release on its website for the next three years. In the interim, Freddie Francis died, eliminating hopes of a potential director's commentary. Salvation ultimately sold their rights to Scorpion Releasing, who recorded an interview with writer Brian Comport and obtained an old radio interview with Francis regarding the film to be included as special features. Vanessa Howard, having learned of the film's cult status, agreed to record a commentary for the DVD; however, Howard was terminally ill at the time, and ultimately proved too weak to participate. The DVD was released on 30 March 2010, with remastered audio and video.
