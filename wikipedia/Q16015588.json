Only Jim Cornford performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: John Langridge, George Cox and Harry Parks. James Langridge reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to appendicitis. Charles Oakes and new captain Hugh Bartlett were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary Billy Griffith had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour. Other players who appeared were Paul Carey, Donald Smith, Jim Wood, Jack Oakes, John Nye and two future Test players Alan Oakman and David Sheppard.Playfair, pp. 99\u2013100."]}, {"page": "John Nye", "response": ["John Nye may refer to:", "*John Nye (scientist) (1923\u20132019), English physicist and glaciologist", "*John Nye (cricketer) (1914\u20132002), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Nye (surname)", "response": ["* John Nye (scientist) (1923-2019), English physicist and glaciologist", "* John Nye (cricketer) (1914\u20132002), English cricketer"]}]}}
