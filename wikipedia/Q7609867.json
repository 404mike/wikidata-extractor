Dillon 1991  p. xcii  Plotinus relied heavily on the concept of logos, but no explicit references to Christian thought can be found in his works, although there are significant traces of them in his doctrine. Plotinus specifically avoided using the term logos to refer to the second person of his trinity.Neoplatonism in Relation to Christianityby Charles Elsee 2009  pp. 89\u201390  However, Plotinus influenced Gaius Marius Victorinus, who then influenced Augustine of Hippo.The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology edited by Alan Richardson, John Bowden 1983  p. 448  Centuries later, Carl Jung acknowledged the influence of Plotinus in his writings.Jung and aesthetic experience by Donald H.
