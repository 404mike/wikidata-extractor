Watt had no knowledge of the service, and claimed the idea was originally instigated by Wright. Wright prepared a rough shooting outline and script by travelling on the railway and used conversations picked up by a stenographer to write the dialogue, all of which was used in the film. Watt then used the rough version to write a full script as the outline had lacked enough detail, \"but there was a shape\". He contacted the LMS and was amazed to find the railway had its own film director who offered assistance. Watt described the research process as \"reasonably straightforward\", which included multiple trips along the railway, and soon completed a full treatment. Wright later said that Watt changed his dialogue towards \"a more human and down-to-earth\" style which he praised him for doing. Early into development, however, Wright had to dedicate more time to other projects and left Watt in charge as director, yet both are credited as the film's two writers, directors, and producers. Initially, Grierson sent his team to observe the postal train staff at work with the aim of producing an information film on the train's operations, but little of the information reported back was used.
