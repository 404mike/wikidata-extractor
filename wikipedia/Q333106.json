Belloc was also an orator, poet, sailor, satirist, writer of letters, soldier, and political activist. His Catholic faith had a strong impact on his works. \nBelloc became a naturalised British subject in 1902 while retaining his French citizenship.He served as President of the Oxford Union and later MP for Salford South from 1906 to 1910. Belloc was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds.\nBelloc's writings encompassed religious poetry and comic verse for children. His widely sold Cautionary Tales for Children included \"Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion\" and \"Matilda, who told lies and was burned to death\". He wrote historical biographies and numerous travel works, including The Path to Rome (1902). He also collaborated with G. K.

In 1931, British historian Sir John Squire collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period for his anthology If It Had Happened Otherwise. In that work, scholars from major universities, as well as important non-academic authors, turned their attention to such questions as \"If the Moors in Spain Had Won\" and \"If Louis XVI Had Had an Atom of Firmness\". The essays range from serious scholarly efforts to Hendrik Willem van Loon's fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th-century New Amsterdam, a Dutch city-state on the island of Manhattan.
