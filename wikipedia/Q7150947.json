The first commission and recording, John Tavener's Eternity's Sunrise, met with enthusiastic critical acclaim and led to a second new Tavener work and recording, Total Eclipse. David Bedford's Like a Strand of Scarlet followed in 2001 and, in 2003, the AAM premiered John Woolrich's Arcangelo, written to mark the 350th anniversary of the birth of Arcangelo Corelli. The next commission in 2006 celebrated the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth with a work from the Scottish-American composer Thea Musgrave, Journey into Light, which was written as a companion piece to Mozart's Exsultate, jubilate. Recently, this trend has been revived with commissioning the harpsichordist, conductor, and scholar Mahan Esfahani to write a new orchestration of Bach's The Art of Fugue, which was premiered at the BBC Proms in July 2012.", "Both Tavener recordings are on Harmonia Mundi (France), for whom the AAM has made a large number of CDs: Mozart's Za\u00efde and Christmas music by Sch\u00fctz and his contemporaries (conducted by Paul Goodwin); violin concertos by J.S. Bach and Vivaldi; and concerti grossi by Handel and Geminiani (directed by Andrew Manze); and Bach's harpsichord concertos (played by Richard Egarr). Choral recordings include works by Bach, Handel, Purcell and Vivaldi, with King's College Choir under Stephen Cleobury, and several recordings with Edward Higginbottom and New College Choir, including Pergolesi's Marian Vespers and Handel's coronation anthems, a collection of music from 17th and 18th-century English coronations. With Richard Egarr, the orchestra has released Handel's instrumental music Opp. 1\u20137, as well as Bach's four orchestral suites and his St John Passion. In 2013, the Academy launched an in-house label for its future recordings.", "In 1996, the AAM appointed Paul Goodwin as associate conductor and Andrew Manze as associate director under Hogwood.  In 2003, Manze resigned as associate director, to be replaced in 2005 by Richard Egarr.  On 1 September 2006, Egarr succeeded Hogwood as music director of the AAM and Hogwood received the title of emeritus director."]}, {"page": "The English Concert", "response": ["*Paul Goodwin"]}, {"page": "Athalia (Handel)", "response": ["|2010|| Geraldine McGreevy,Nuria Rial,Lawrence Zazzo, Aaron M\u00e4chler,Charles Daniels,David Wilson-Johnson||Paul GoodwinKammerorchester Basel and Vocalconsort Berlin||CD:Deutsche HMCat:88697723172"]}, {"page": "Lynne Dawson", "response": ["* Za\u00efde, Mozart (with Academy of Ancient Music/Paul Goodwin), Harmonia Mundi (1998)"]}, {"page": "Lotario", "response": ["||Paul GoodwinKammerorchester Basel"]}, {"page": "Chen Jiafeng", "response": ["Jiafeng Chen\u2019s career as a soloist has taken him to all six continents.
