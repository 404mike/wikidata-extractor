One of the trials forced him to miss the second Swansea encounter of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; his place in the Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett.Hughes (1986) p. 199 Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John.Thomas (1979) p. 182 In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking David Watkins place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team.Thomas (1979) p. 154 This was seen as a surprise move by the Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11\u20134, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the 'Wallabies', due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes.Sports historian Wayne Thomas in his 1979 book A Century of Welsh Rugby Players (p. 162) places criticism for this loss on the midfield players. Stating \"John himself escaped the worst criticism even though guilty of poor positioning to take Allan Lewis's long pass\". Conversely, John's play during this game is praised by other sources. David Watkins in his 1979 autobiography \"The David Watkins Story\" (p. 101) wrote: \"He [John] played very well and I knew he would retain his place against Scotland,\". John himself, in his 1974 autobiography (p. 69-70), wrote that he \"...hadn't played a blinder... but I hadn't made a lot of mistakes\", and follows this up with an extract from Cliff Morgan's after-match report which stated: \"Barry John had a grand first international and looked as if he could beat the defence at any time.\" Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11\u20130 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, and then added to his tally with a dropped goal.", "With the end of the 1968/69 season, the Welsh Rugby Union sent a team to tour New Zealand and Australia. At half-back, Wales sent John, Edwards, Phil Bennett and Chico Hopkins, but in all three Tests, two against the New Zealand \"All Blacks\" and one against Australia, Welsh coach Clive Rowlands kept faith with John and Edwards. The Welsh team were completely overwhelmed by the All Blacks, losing both Tests, 0\u201319 and 12\u201333.Griffiths (1987) p. 4:38 A change of tactics by Rowlands, by switching Gerald Davies to the right wing, gave Wales a victory over Australia, and a six try victory over Fiji (in which John was replaced by Bennett) on their return to Britain, helped the team gain a warm reception on their return.Smith (1980) p. 399", "The 1971 Five Nations Championship was a new dawn for Welsh rugby. The new National Stadium was completed, and the team now into their Second Golden era were both experienced and talented.Griffiths (1987) p. 4:39 John and Edwards played in all four games, starting with an easy win over England. Wales won 22\u20136, with John scoring six points from two dropped goals. The second game of the Championship, played against Scotland, was a close encounter, won by Wales 19\u201318 thanks to a late Gerald Davies try converted by John Taylor.Godwin (1984) p. 353 Barry John scored eight of Wales' points, with a try, penalty goal and a conversion; missing only his trademark drop goal to complete a full house of scores. John surpassed his Scotland tally in the next match, a home game against Ireland, scoring 11\u00a0points with a dropped goal, conversion and two penalty goals. Seen as one of Wales' more accomplished victories, the 23\u20130 win gave the team a Triple Crown title, and set up a Grand Slam encounter with France.Godwin (1984) p. 355 Despite the low score, the 9\u20135 win over France at Stade Colombes on 27 March was a match of the highest quality.Godwin (1984) p. 356 Edwards and John scored all the points in the encounter, Edwards with a try, John a try and a penalty goal. This was Wales' first Grand Slam since 1952 and the 1971 squad is seen as the greatest ever to be fielded by Wales.Godwin (1984) p. 352", "A win in the third Test was vital to keep the Lions hope of a series win alive. John scored ten points of the 13\u20133 win, the other three coming from Wales' team-mate Gerald Davies. The final Test ended in a 14\u201314 draw, giving the series to the tourists. John scored eight of the Lions points, having scored in every match, Test and regional, he had played in.", "Gerald Davies, who played with John for Wales and the British Lions, in his 1971 autobiography when contrasting Gareth Edwards' and John's different temperaments described Edwards as \"fiery and impulsive\", but John was \"...fairer, aloof and apart.

The ball moved through the backs to Gerald Davies who managed to squeeze in to score a try at the right hand corner. With great presence of mind, the Scottish defence kept up the chase to prevent Davies from touching down near the posts. With the score at 18-17 and ball to be placed on the right hand side, the conversion looked almost impossible, particularly as Barry John, the usual Welsh kicker, was right footed and had been concussed earlier in the match. Instead of Barry, Taylor took the conversion attempt and kicked the ball perfectly between the posts. The final score was 19-18, giving Wales the victory.
