When he returned, signing for Chesterfield in May 1935, he was reported to have scored 40 goals since Christmas for Eden Colliery Welfare in the North-Eastern League. He spent the season as backup to Maurice Dando, contributing 4 goals\u00a0\u2013 a hat-trick in a 5\u20130 defeat of Wrexham and the only goal of the home fixture against Lincoln City\u00a0\u2013 from 14 league matches as Chesterfield won the Third Division Northern Section title. For the reserves, he scored at least 26 goals in Midland League competition. For the new season at the higher level, Chesterfield brought in Walter Ponting to play at centre-forward, and Harvey spent the whole season in the reserves, for whom he scored at least 34 goals. Although he was available for transfer, no league club were prepared to meet the fee, so he again dropped out of the Football League, joining Midland League club Boston United for 1937\u201338."]}, {"page": "Bert Swindells", "response": ["In 1937, in a swap deal also involving team-mate Ernie Wright and Chesterfield's Maurice Dando and Jacob Taylor, he joined but never played for Chesterfield. He later moved on to play for Barrow, Chelmsford, Bradford City, Mossley and Macclesfield Town, where he was joint top-scorer in the 1946\u201347 season. During World War II, Swindells also played for Stockport County."]}]}}
