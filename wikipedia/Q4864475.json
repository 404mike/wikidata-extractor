He was educated at Eton and Harvard Business School. On his grandfather's death, he succeeded as the 12th Baron Farnham (and 15th of his family Baronetcy). He was a high ranking freemason and held office in the United Grand Lodge of England as Senior Grand Warden 1977\u201378, Assistant Grand Master 1982\u201389, Deputy Grand Master 1989\u201391, and Pro Grand Master 1991\u20132001.Lord Farnham was due to retire on or about his 70th birthday; a few months beforehand, he died, and was succeeded in the barony by his brother, Simon Kenlis Maxwell, who lived in England.\nHis wife, Diana, was a Lady of the Bedchamber (1987\u20132021) to Queen Elizabeth II. Lady Farnham rode alongside the Queen on the way to the Diamond Jubilee service on 5 June 2012 in the absence (through illness) of the Duke of Edinburgh.What is now the Farnham Estate Hotel was the on-site replacement to the family seat and its main structure was commissioned around 1780 by the 1st Earl of Farnham and designed by James Wyatt. Its conversion was enabled when Lady Farnham sold it to a local entrepreneur.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peerage law", "response": ["However, the matter did not end there. In 1991, a solicitor named Andrew Turek published an article in the Cambridge Law Journal, in which he suggested that, if Lord Reid was indeed accurate in suggesting that Irish peers had no further right to elect peers because the political entity being represented (Ireland) no longer existed, then the right of representative peers ought to have ended in 1922, when the Irish Free State was formed. He suggested that there was no basis for calling representative peers who had already been elected to Parliament. Then, Turek pointed out the principle of the creation of a peerage by writ. He argued that if an individual was not entitled to attend the House of Lords, but nonetheless received a writ of summons (as the remaining Irish representative peers did following the formation of the Irish Free State), then such individuals were automatically granted a new peerage. In 1995, Barry Maxwell, 12th Baron Farnham applied for a writ of summons because his grandfather, the 11th Baron and a representative peer, had been summoned by writ when there was no basis for doing so, and that therefore a new barony was created for him. The Lords, however, held that there was, in the first place, no error in issuing writs to the Irish representative peers after the formation of the Irish Free State. The Privileges Committee agreed with the Attorney-General that the Irish peers had been elected for life, and that the formation of the Irish Free State only implicitly repealed the right of the Irish peers to hold further elections."]}, {"page": "United Grand Lodge of England", "response": ["*Barry Maxwell, 12th Baron Farnham (1991 to 2001)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2001", "response": ["*Barry Maxwell, 12th Baron Farnham, 69, British aristocrat."]}, {"page": "Diana Maxwell, Baroness Farnham", "response": ["Born Diana Marion Gunnis on 24 May 1931, she was the elder daughter of Nigel Eric Murray Gunnis, of Branden, Sissinghurst, Kent.
