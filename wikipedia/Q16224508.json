He was a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and is a co-founder of the Amy Winehouse Foundation. In recognition of his intersex activism, The Independent on Sunday called him an LGBT \"national treasure\" and ranked him second in its 2015 \"Rainbow List\" of the most influential LGBT people in the UK.

Hermaphroditus, a young man, is chased by the nymph Salmacis. She begs the Gods to bind her and Hermaphroditus together, and the Gods literally fulfill her wish. Hermaphroditus' name is a compound of his parent's names\u2014Hermes and Aphrodite. He instantaneously turns into someone of both sexes. Devastated because he is no longer fully male, he \"curses\" the location where he first met Salmacis. Graham stated that the use of \"hermaphrodite\" carries negative connotations: Based on this origin story, the hermaphrodite's lot is miserable, associated with disempowerment, the theft of identity and an unhappy dual existence. In addition, the term \"hermaphrodite\" may be deemed problematic because it alludes to an impossible state of being: no-one can be equally male and female and the preferred term \"intersex\" indicates a blended rather than divided state. While the modern term might indicate the possibility of redefining sexual ambivalence, Cal is associated in the novel with the mythic term and all it connotes. His connection to this tragic figure is confirmed by his performance as \"Hermaphroditus\" in a sex show at the age of fourteen, just as he is beginning his female to male transition.", "Seven Graham agrees with Hillman and Holmes, writing that Cal is paralleled with the tragic Greek mythological characters Hermaphroditus, Tiresias, and the Minotaur. They opined that other \"deviant\" characters in the novel such as Lefty and Desdemona are spared the \"tragic or monstrous\" allusions even though there are numerous examples of incest in Greek mythology. They listed the marriage of Oedipus and his mother Jocasta, as well as the son Adonis produced by the incest between Theias and his daughter Smyrna as examples. Therefore, Graham stated that comparing Cal, an intersex person, to people who were \"mythological monsters\" is \"complicit with [the] exploitation\" of intersex people."]}, {"page": "Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome", "response": ["* Seven Graham"]}, {"page": "List of intersex people", "response": ["*Seven Graham (1969), activist, comedian, filmmaker and playwright, and drug addiction counsellor."]}, {"page": "Intersex rights in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Accounts of intersex people include Hereford Mappa Mundi, a medieval map of the known world (c.1300), includes a hermaphrodite, outside the borders of the world known to its makers.
