He was elected as an Ulster Unionist Party representative on Limavady Borough Council in 1997, but soon resigned in opposition to the Good Friday Agreement.\nDouglas was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998 as an independent Unionist representing East Londonderry.  With two other anti-agreement Unionists, he formed the United Unionist Coalition.  He retained his seat on the council in 2001, but lost his Assembly seat, along with all the other Coalition MLAs, in 2003.  In 2005, he was able to top the poll in his seat in Limavady.\nDouglas subsequently joined Traditional Unionist Voice, and contested  East Londonderry seat for the party at the 2011 Assembly election, in which he came 10th out of the 12 candidates and was not elected to a seat. In reference to his decision to run, Douglas said: \"Though public service has been part of my life and upbringing, returning to Stormont has not been a burning ambition. But while I\u2019ve watched the past 4 years of failure and deadlock, with virtually nothing done for East Londonderry, I\u2019ve concluded it requires us all, myself included, to try and make things better.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Limavady", "response": ["* Boyd Douglas (born 13 July 1950) - Councillor on Limavady Borough Council and later Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council from 1997 - 2014.
