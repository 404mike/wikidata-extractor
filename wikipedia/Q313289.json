As such, the game emphasized role-playing over combat for, according to Steffan O'Sullivan, \"You're playing a rabbit, after all \u2013 how much combat do you want to do?\" David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, commented that Bunnies & Burrows \"pushed setting even farther\" than other early RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons and En Garde!, as the \"player characters were intelligent rabbits and had to compete for food, avoid predators, and deal with internal warren politics\".

Another disappointing chart performance led to Hansson's withdrawal from the popular music scene, and though he worked on a number of projects with friends, little was heard from him until 1985 when he released, in Sweden only, the album Mitt I Livet (In the Middle of Life) on Silence Records (SRS 4700).

Kelly also incorporated the moment he almost ran over a homeless person while driving, arguments with his school teachers over the curriculum, and his personal experiences with sleepwalking into the narrative. Kelly had Frank as a rabbit from the beginning, but he was unsure whether the character originated from a dream or his longtime interest in the animal novel Watership Down by Richard Adams. The novel was to be taught in Karen's English class after the school had censored Graham Greene from her curriculum, but it was a subplot that was abandoned in the theatrical version, but included in the director's cut."]}, {"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Richard Adams (1920\u20132016) \u2013 Watership Down"]}, {"page": "List of fantasy authors", "response": ["* Richard Adams, (1920\u20132016) author of Watership Down"]}, {"page": "Watership Down", "response": ["Watership Down is an adventure novel by English author Richard Adams, published by Rex Collings Ltd of London in 1972.
