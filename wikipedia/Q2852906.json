Baker's first film had been The October Man (1947) and he was best known for The One That Got Away (1957) and A Night to Remember (1958).Hearn & Barnes, p. 129. Following the failure of Two Left Feet (1963), he moved into television, directing episodes of The Human Jungle (1963\u201364), The Saint (1962\u201369) and The Avengers. Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as A Night to Remember gave him the technical expertise to handle the film's significant special effects requirements. Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as A Night to Remember and The One That Got Away enabled him to give Quatermass and the Pit the air of realism it needed to be convincing to audiences. He was impressed by Nigel Kneale's screenplay, feeling the script was \"taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive. It needed no work at all. All one had to do was cast it and shoot it.\"Baker, p. 124. He was also impressed with Hammer Films' lean set-up: having been used to working for major studios with thousands of full-time employees, he was surprised to find that Hammer's core operation consisted of just five people and enjoyed how this made the decision making process fast and simple. Quatermass and the Pit was the first film the director was credited as \"Roy Ward Baker\", having previously been credited as \"Roy Baker\". The change was made to avoid confusion with another Roy Baker who was a sound editor. Baker later regretted making the change as many people assumed he was a new director."]}, {"page": "Jacqueline Pearce", "response": ["After graduating from RADA in 1963, Pearce made her television debut in the series A Question of Happiness, in which she played a waitress in the episode \"Watch Me I'm a Bird\", alongside her RADA contemporaries Drewe Henley, Ian McShane and John Hurt.

She later appeared in minor roles in Danger Man and in Sky West and Crooked, where McShane played a character who was her boyfriend.

These were filmed one after another on the same location and both released in 1966."]}, {"page": "The Gorgon", "response": ["The Gorgon was based on a story submitted to Hammer by their Canadian fan, J. Llewellyn Divine. Director John Gilling and producer Anthony Nelson Keys expanded on Divine's outline, developing it into a screenplay. For the role of the monster, former ballerina Prudence Hyman was recruited because the monster was supposed to float gracefully like a wraith."]}, {"page": "Roy Ashton", "response": ["Although he had a long and varied career in British films, Ashton is chiefly remembered for his work on the Hammer's horror films.Sachs & Wall After assisting Leakey on The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Ashton found himself in charge of make-up for The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959) when Leakey, having had his retainer cut by the company's associate producer, Anthony Nelson Keys, left the company in disgust.Sachs & Wall, p. 40 Ashton's main effort on that film, to transform a Great Dane into the title character, was barely a success, the result only appearing briefly in the final cut. His next film, The Man Who Could Cheat Death (1959), involved transforming Anton Diffring into \"a living corpse\": \"To produce all the ravages of time and debauchery, I felt that the final effect should be a cocktail of fatal diseases spreading rapidly across his body. Glandular fever, smallpox, cholera, typhus and typhoid, represented some of the ailments that Bonner had come into contact with (through his unseen travels) as a crusading physician.\"Ashton, p. 49 The result was widely admired: over a decade later the American make-up artist, Dick Smith, consulted Ashton about the effect to create make-up to age Dustin Hoffman as a 103-year-old man in Little Big Man, and was to repeat the effect in several subsequent films.Sachs & Wall, p. 50"]}, {"page": "The Devil-Ship Pirates", "response": ["Filming began in 19 August 1963 at Bray Studios in London.
