Prim and prudish, she previously worked at the upmarket Caf\u00e9 Bonbon. She frequently snaps at people for using bad language and frowns on the sexual shenanigans of Twinkle, whom she is convinced did not have to work for her catering qualification. Overtly right-wing, she believes everything she reads in the Daily Mail without question, often quoting the articles she has read, and is prone to making remarks of dubious political correctness. She is fixated on her weight and dieting, although she is tempted to snack on Mars bars in stressful situations and it is revealed in several episodes that she was formerly obese. She has been married for thirty years to her husband Bob (Jack Smethurst), and hopes to move to the nearby upmarket village of Mobberley after her retirement."]}, {"page": "Eric Sykes", "response": ["Sykes toured Australia with the play Run for Your Wife (1987\u201388) with a cast that included Jack Smethurst, David McCallum, and Katy Manning.

A contemporary reviewer in the Daily Mirror, Mary Malone, believed \"the only characters who leave the screen with their dignity intact are the blacks. Now that's what I call prejudice.\"", "* Eddie Booth (Jack Smethurst) is a white socialist. His world is turned upside down when Bill and Barbie Reynolds, who are black, move in next door. Eddie is even more annoyed when Bill gets a job at the same factory as him, and refers to him as a \"nig-nog\", \"Sambo\", \"choc-ice\" and \"King Kong\" among other things. He also has a tendency to call Chinese, Pakistanis or Indians names like \"Fu Manchu\", \"Gunga Din\" and \"Ali Baba\". He repeatedly insinuates that all blacks (and Bill in particular) are cannibals, and claims that \"white always takes precedence over black\". He is temporarily promoted to foreman in the episode \"Clarky Leaves\", but ends up being demoted after Bill complains he is running the factory like a forced labour camp; afterward, Bill gets the foreman's job. Eddie is a supporter of Manchester United.
