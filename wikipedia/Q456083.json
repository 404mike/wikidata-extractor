He was the uncle of Sir James Clark Ross, who explored the Arctic with him, and later led expeditions to Antarctica.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northwest Passage", "response": ["In the first half of the 19th century, some parts of the Northwest Passage (north of the Bering Strait) were explored separately by many expeditions, including those by John Ross, Elisha Kent Kane, William Edward Parry, and James Clark Ross; overland expeditions were also led by John Franklin, George Back, Peter Warren Dease, Thomas Simpson, and John Rae. In 1826 Frederick William Beechey explored the north coast of Alaska, discovering Point Barrow."]}, {"page": "Robert Bylot", "response": ["When the bay was \"rediscovered\" by Sir John Ross in 1818, the records of the Bylot\u2013Baffin voyage proved extremely accurate. In England, almost total credit for the discovery was given to Baffin, and Bylot was virtually ignored. Historian Farley Mowat speculated two possible reasons for this: Bylot's lack of education and lower position relative to Baffin in English society, and his involvement in the mutiny during Hudson's expedition."]}, {"page": "Back River (Nunavut)", "response": ["Its first exploration by Europeans was led by George Back in 1834, as part of an expedition initially mounted to seek the 1829 expedition of Captain John Ross. Back learned of the river from local guides, and throughout his memoir of the expedition he referred to the river as the \"Thlew-ee-cho-dezeth\", which he translated as \"Great Fish River\". Later 19th-century explorers habitually referred to the river as \"Back's Great Fish River\", but gradually this was shortened to \"Back River\" over time."]}, {"page": "List of explorers", "response": ["| Sir John Ross", "| John Ross"]}, {"page": "John Ericsson", "response": ["but was met with resistance from London's established 'Fire Laddies' and municipal authorities. An engine Braithwaite and Ericsson constructed for Sir John Ross's 1829 Arctic expedition failed and was dumped on the shores of Prince Regent Inlet. At this stage of Ericsson's career the most successful and enduring of his inventions was the surface condenser, which allowed a steamer to recover fresh water for its boilers while at sea. His 'deep sea lead,' a pressure-activated fathometer was another minor, but enduring success. "]}, {"page": "William Baffin", "response": ["Baffin Bay and Baffin Island were named in William Baffin's honour, and he is responsible for the names of several of their features. His journals were the only account of several of his voyages. Excerpts were printed by Samuel Purchas in 1625, but Baffin's charts and hydrographic observations were omitted owing to the expense involved. All but one were subsequently lost, and in time Baffin's discoveries came to be doubted. He was, however, a hero to the explorer John Ross, who led an expedition in 1818 that confirmed Baffin's account in almost all particulars."]}, {"page": "John Rae (explorer)", "response": ["In 1830, John Ross had also been told that the Gulf of Boothia was a bay.Hayes, map 129. He sailed partway up the east coast of the Gulf, but has soon turned back because he needed to make preparations for winter. He became one of the first Europeans to winter in the high Arctic without the aid of a depot ship. By December he had learned how to build igloos, which he later found warmer than European tents.", "Rae's second journey began on 5 April 1847. He crossed to Committee Bay, travelled up its west coast for four days and then headed west across the base of the Simpson Peninsula to Pelly Bay. He went north and from a hill thought he could see Lord Mayor Bay, on the west side of the Gulf of Boothia, where John Ross had been trapped in ice from 1829 to 1833. He circled much of the coast of the Simpson Peninsula and returned to Repulse Bay. His third journey began on 13 May 1847. He crossed from Repulse Bay to Committee Bay and went up the east coast hoping to reach the Fury and Hecla Strait, which William Edward Parry's men had seen in 1822. The weather was bad and they began to run short of food. On 28 May, Rae turned back at a place he called Cape Crozier which he thought was about  south of the strait."]}, {"page": "Edward Sabine", "response": ["Sabine was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1818, and it was thanks to the society's recommendations that he was invited to take part that year in Captain John Ross's first Arctic expedition. As the expedition's appointed astronomer, Sabine was told to assist Ross \"in making such observations as may tend to the improvement of geography and navigation, and the advancement of science in general\"."]}, {"page": "Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet", "response": ["In his position at the Admiralty, Barrow was a great promoter of Arctic voyages of discovery, including those of John Ross, William Edward Parry, James Clark Ross and John Franklin. The Barrow Strait in the Canadian Arctic as well as Point Barrow and the city of Barrow in Alaska are named after him. He is reputed to have been the initial proposer of Saint Helena as the new place of exile for Napoleon Bonaparte following the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Barrow was a fellow of the Royal Society and received the degree of LL.D from the University of Edinburgh in 1821. A baronetcy was conferred on him by Sir Robert Peel in 1835. He was also a member of the Raleigh Club, a forerunner of the Royal Geographical Society.", "*Barrow's Boys \u2013 Fergus Fleming (1998) \"For 30 years beginning 1816, the British Admiralty's John Barrow and his elite team charted large areas of the Arctic, discovered the North Magnetic Pole, were the first to see volcanoes in the Antarctic, crossed the Sahara to find Timbuktu and the mouth of the Niger \u2013 John Ross, John Franklin, William Edward Parry and others.\"Bibliopolis "]}]}}
