Another FA Cup tie was Vale hold eventual winners Arsenal to a goalless draw at Highbury and 1\u20131 at Vale Park (Wayne Corden equalising a Dennis Bergkamp goal) before the Gunners eventually prevailed 4\u20133 on penalties, despite Lee Dixon missing their opening kick. Vale found themselves in deep relegation trouble going into the final match at Huddersfield after three straight defeats. Goals from Martin Foyle, Jan Jansson (two) and Lee Mills saw Vale claim a 4\u20130 win and an escape at the expense of Manchester City and Stoke City. 1998\u201399 saw Port Vale fare little better, with an early League Cup defeat to Chester City setting the tone.

Midway through the second half, Junior Mendes doubled the lead from close range after the Northampton goalkeeper Lee Harper failed to keep hold of Tom Curtis' shot.  In the final minute of the match, Northampton were reduced to ten men when Ashley Westwood was sent off for a foul on Colin Larkin, and the match ended 2\u20130.  The second leg took place four days later at Field Mill in Mansfield.  Ten minutes before half-time, Mansfield went ahead after Marc Richards scored with a volley from a Paul Trollope pass.  Chris Hargreaves then scored with a header from a Martin Smith free kick to make it 2\u20130 at half time, levelling the tie on aggregate.  Thirty seconds into the second half, Smith made it 3\u20130 after Trollope capitalised on a misplaced pass from Wayne Corden.  Northampton levelled the tie on aggregate when Curtis scored from a rebound.  Regular time finished with the aggregate score 3\u20133 and the game went into extra time, but with no change to the scoreline, a penalty shootout was required to decide the tie.
