Valve indefinitely banned seven players who were involved in the scandal from attending any Majors. Tyler \"Skadoodle\" Latham was the only iBUYPOWER player not to be banned, as he did not receive any payment after the game. Valve would later make the bans permanent, causing some controversy in the Counter-Strike community.
