He was educated at Hawkshead Grammar School (where Wordsworth was a contemporary), (e-published PhD thesis) and then in the lower school of the grammar school in Preston.  He then became a weaver, but at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed for seven years to a printer in Preston. In the fifth year of his apprenticeship, he terminated it and moved to Leeds, where he finished his apprenticeship with the printer of the Leeds Mercury, one of two Leeds weekly newspapers. In later years, both Baines and his political opponents would have it that he arrived in Leeds with little more than the clothes on his back, but on completion of his apprenticeship he set up his own printworks with the aid of a loan of \u00a3100 from his father. He became a member of the Leeds Reasoning Society (a discussion group which eschewed religious or political issues) and of the local subscription library. He became attracted to non-conformism, and after attending the chapels of both Unitarians and Congregationalists settled for the latter (although he did not formally become a member until 1840).

Palmerston believed that this was incitement to the working class to begin agitating for reform and told Gladstone: \"What every Man and Woman too have a Right to, is to be well governed and under just Laws, and they who propose a change ought to shew that the present organization does not accomplish those objects\".Guedalla, p. 282."]}, {"page": "Robert Lowe", "response": ["Lord Palmerston had been a towering opponent to widening democratic participation and his death in October 1865 opened the way to the Russell\u2013Gladstone reform ministry, which introduced the Reform Bill of 1866.

Moreover, he had been heavily shocked by his experiences of the comparatively developed union movement in his time in Australia in a less rigid class system. He had already made known his objections to the advance of \"democracy\", notably in his speech in 1865 on Sir Edward Baines's Borough Franchise Bill. He was not invited to join the new ministry.
