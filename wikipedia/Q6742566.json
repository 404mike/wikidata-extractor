During the 1983\u201384 season Carlisle emerged as promotion contenders but failure to win their final 10 games saw them finish 7th. He joined Darlington in 1985 before moving on to Stockport County, but returned to Carlisle in 1986 where he played another two years. Although his scoring form continued in his second spell, the team suffered relegation to the Fourth Division and he left the club in 1988. He then played for Morecambe.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["* 1977  Malcolm Poskett"]}, {"page": "Carlisle United F.C.", "response": ["Another relegation followed in 76/77 before returning to the Second Division in 1982 under Bob Stokoe.

Early in his career he broke his ribs and backbone, but learned the tricks of the trade, such as interlinking arms with opposition players to prevent them from jumping. Billy Horner compared him with Malcolm Poskett, and stated the only quality missing in Houchen's game was aggression. Horner and his coaching team of George Smith and Willie Maddren taught Houchen how to protect himself from the highly physical centre-halves that dominated the division, and the youngster learned how to hold the ball up and bring other players into the attack."]}, {"page": "History of Carlisle United F.C.", "response": ["Another relegation followed in 1977 before returning to the Second Division in 1982 under Bob Stokoe.
