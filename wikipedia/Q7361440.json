He began his football career with Walsall Wood before joining Small Heath of the Football League First Division in 1904. He made his debut for the club, by then renamed Birmingham, on 16 December 1905, scoring in a 5\u20130 win at home to Nottingham Forest, and played fairly regularly for the rest of that season, but lost his place to Charlie Tickle when the latter recovered from injury. Towards the end of the 1906\u201307 season he moved on to Burton United, but never played for the league team, and left for Aston Villa when Burton failed to gain re-election to the Football League. Harper played only twice for Villa before being sold together with Jimmy Cantrell to Notts County in March 1908. After making only ten league appearances in two seasons he dropped into non-league football with Mansfield Invicta. Harper died in Birmingham in August 1949 at the age of 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lichfield", "response": ["* Roly Harper (1881\u20131949), professional footballer, born in Lichfield"]}, {"page": "Harper (name)", "response": ["*Roly Harper (1881\u20131949), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Rowland Harper", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roly Harper"]}, {"page": "1907\u201308 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["New additions to the squad included Charlie Wallace, Bert Turner, Roly Harper, Joseph Wilcox, George Reeves, Tommy Lyons, Walter Kimberley and Peter Kyle.avfchistory.co.uk 1907\u201308 season"]}]}}
