He continued to believe that his approach to the problem of tariff reform was the correct one, and wrote to John Strachey on 16 November saying that \"it was a case of a choice of two evils, and all that one could do was to take the lesser of the two, and that I am sure we have done\". Speaking to Edward Carson, F.E. Smith, Austen Chamberlain and Lord Balcarres in December after two weeks of receiving negative letters from party members about the change, Law outlined that he would not be averse to a return to the previous policy considering the negative feelings from the party, but felt that this would require the resignation of both himself and Lansdowne."]}, {"page": "Cecil Spring Rice", "response": ["He was educated at Eton and at Balliol College, Oxford, at both of which he was a contemporary and close friend of George Nathaniel Curzon, and at the latter of which he studied under the direction of Benjamin Jowett.

However, Spring Rice contributed, alongside John William Mackail, to the composition of a famous sardonic doggerel about Curzon that was published in The Balliol Masque, and, when British Ambassador to the United States, he was suspected by Curzon of trying to prevent Curzon's engagement to the American Mary Leiter, whom Curzon nevertheless married. However, Spring Rice assumed for a certainty, like many of Curzon's other friends, that Curzon would inevitably become Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: he wrote to Curzon in 1891, 'When you are Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs I hope you will restore the vanished glory of England, lead the European concert, decide the fate of nations, and give me three months' leave instead of two'."]}, {"page": "Clough Williams-Ellis", "response": ["*With John Strachey, Architecture (1920, reprinted 2009), 125 pages"]}, {"page": "Mermaid Series", "response": ["Notes by John Strachey, two volumes"]}, {"page": "John Strachey (politician)", "response": ["By 1938 Strachey was persuaded by Keynesianism and the New Deal of American president Franklin D.
