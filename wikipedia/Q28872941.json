He was educated at Wimbledon Common. Five of his six siblings were also born in India and it is possible that his father was a member of the Indian Civil Service.Little is known of Smyth's life, although it is believed that he was a member of Surrey County Cricket Club. It is not known how he came to play for Kent in the only cricket match in which he has been identified - a match against Sussex at Hove in which he scored a single run and did not bowl.It is unclear how Smyth made his living - possibly as a solicitor, although by 1891 he was considered to be independently wealthy. He appears to have married but there is no record of whether he had any children. Smyth died at Clapham in 1906 aged 68.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Smyth, Benjamin", "response": ["#redirectBenjamin Smyth"]}]}}
