He was born at Timworth, Suffolk and died at Gorleston, Norfolk. He changed his name from \"Harrison\" to \"Ward\" in August 1868.Ward was educated privately at Bury St Edmunds and at Jesus College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a left-arm bowler: sources disagree about whether he was a fast bowler or a medium-paced one, but agree that he bowled in the round-arm style. He played in three matches for Cambridge University in 1868 as \"E. E. Harrison\" without making much impact, and was then not picked for any first-team games at all in 1869. He returned to the university team in 1870 and took seven wickets in his first game, against the MCC. That led to his selection for the 1870 University Match against Oxford University, a game that has been widely known as \"Cobden's Match\" through the feat of the Cambridge bowler Frank Cobden, who took the last three Oxford wickets in three balls \u2013 a hat-trick \u2013 to win the game for Cambridge by just two runs. Ward was just as influential in the Cambridge victory, his six wickets for 29 in the Oxford second innings, in 32 four-ball overs, being the best bowling performance of his first-class cricket career. He returned to the Cambridge side in 1871, but was less effective, and the University Match of that year, in which he failed to take any wickets, was his last first-class match. He later played minor cricket for Suffolk County Cricket Club.Ward graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1872 and in the same year he was ordained as a Church of England deacon, becoming a priest two years later. He had a highly itinerant clerical career, serving parishes in Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Northumberland, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, retiring in 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Ward", "response": ["Edward Ward may refer to:", "*Sir Edward Ward, 1st Baronet, of Bexley (c. 1618\u20131684), Sheriff of Norfolk, dubbed knight by Cromwell (1657), baronetcy granted by Charles II (1660)", "*Edward Ward (judge) (1638\u20131714), English lawyer and judge", "*Edward Ward, 7th Baron Dudley (1631\u20131701)", "*Edward Ward, 8th Baron Dudley (1683\u20131704)", "*Edward Ward, 9th Baron Dudley (1704\u20131731), English peer", "*Edward Ward (politician) (1753\u20131812), Irish MP for Bangor and Down", "*Edward Ward, 4th Viscount Bangor (1827\u20131881), Irish representative peer", "*Edward Ward (cricketer) (1847\u20131940), English clergyman and cricketer", "*Sir Edward Ward, 1st Baronet, of Wilbraham Place (1853\u20131928), British army officer, notable reformer of army administration", "*Edward Ward (footballer) (1895\u20131971), association football inside forward active in the 1920s", "*Edward Ward (umpire) (1896\u20131966), West Indian cricket umpire", "*Edward Ward (composer) (1900\u20131971), American film score composer, nominated for seven Oscars between 1939-44", "*Edward Ward, 7th Viscount Bangor (1905\u20131993), Anglo-Irish war correspondent and author", "*Edward Ward (rugby league) (fl. 1940s\u20131950s), rugby league footballer for Great Britain, and Bradford Northern"]}, {"page": "Timworth", "response": ["*Edward Ward, clergyman and cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Edward Ward (1871) : E.
