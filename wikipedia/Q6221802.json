Like Isaac Oliver and Rowland Lockey, Bettes the Younger is believed to have studied under Nicholas Hilliard. He lived in London on Grub Street in St Giles Cripplegate. In later years he moved to the parish of St Gregory-by-St Pauls.\nA miniature portrait of Francis Walsingham, who was buried at St Gregory's Church in 1590, in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch is attributed to Bettes. John Bettes and his studio are thought to have made a number of portraits of Elizabeth I.\nHis wife may have been Magdalen Browne of St Gregory's parish. They married on 1 December 1571. A son, Thomas Bettes, died in August 1593, and a daughter Judith was born in July 1599. Bettes' first wife died, and he married Ellianor Harman on 8 September 1614. John Bettes died in January 1616 and bequeathed his son (also John) a picture of John Bettes the Elder, two easels, and a porphyry slab and muller for grinding pigments.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "English art", "response": ["Nicholas Hilliard (c. 1547\u20137 January 1619) - \"the first native-born genius of English painting\" - began a strong English tradition in the portrait miniature.

Other notable English artists across the period include: Nathaniel Bacon (1585\u20131627); John Bettes the Elder (active c. 1531\u20131570) and John Bettes the Younger (died 1616); George Gower (c.1540\u20131596), William Larkin (early 1580s\u20131619), and Robert Peake the Elder (c. 1551\u20131619). The artists of the Tudor court and their successors until the early 18th century included a number of influential imported talents: Hans Holbein the Younger, Anthony van Dyck, Peter Paul Rubens, Orazio Gentileschi and his daughter Artemisia, Sir Peter Lely (a naturalised English subject from 1662), and Sir Godfrey Kneller (a naturalised English subject by the time of his 1691 knighthood).", "File:Elizabeth I attrib john bettes c1585 90.jpg|John Bettes the Younger's portrait of Elizabeth I; c. 1585."]}, {"page": "Portraiture of Elizabeth I", "response": ["Image:Elizabeth I attrib john bettes c1585 90.jpg|One of five known portraits attributed to John Bettes the Younger or his studio, "]}, {"page": "John Bettes the Elder", "response": ["John Bettes the Elder (active c.\u00a01531\u20131570) was an English artist whose few known paintings date from between about 1543 and 1550.
