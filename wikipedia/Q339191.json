Sources are extremely confused on the dating of these invasions, the participants, and their targets. Modern historians are not even able to discern with certainty whether there were two or more of these invasions or a single prolonged one. It seems that, at first, a major naval expedition was led by the Heruli starting from north of the Black Sea and leading to the ravaging of many cities of Greece (among them, Athens and Sparta). Then another, even more numerous army of invaders started a second naval invasion of the empire. The Romans defeated the barbarians on sea first. Gallienus' army then won a battle in Thrace, and the emperor pursued the invaders. According to some historians, he was the leader of the army who won the great Battle of Naissus, while the majority believes that the victory must be attributed to his successor, Claudius II.J.

Palmyra would formally secede after Odaenathus' death and the ascension of his widow Zenobia. It was not until the reign of Aurelian several years later that the breakaway provinces were truly brought back into the Roman fold.

The size of the legions is unclear. A.H.M. Jones suggested that they could have as many as 3,000 troops, because they are often listed with 10 cohorts, and because they are sometimes divided among many bases. Warren Treadgold suggests that the legions probably had about 1,000 troops and the other units probably had about 500 troops each.Treadgold 1995, pp. 44-49. The different titles of numeri, milites, and cohorts, or vexillationes, equites, cunei, and alae, probably did not correspond with different structures or roles,Treadgold 1995, pp. 87-98. although according to Pat Southern and Karen Dixon, the legiones, auxilia, and cunei of the border armies were part of the limitanei, but higher-status than the older cohortes and alae in the same armies.

According to Luttwak, by the time of Constantine I, the cunei of cavalry, and auxilia of infantry, both usually around 500 men strong, were local provincial units under sector commanders.

A. Judge provides a detailed study demonstrating that a fully organized church system existed before Constantine, leading to the conclusion that \"the argument Christianity owed its triumph to its adoption by Constantine cannot be sustained\". Pat Southern writes that, generally speaking, the empire's inhabitants were not directly affected by Constantine's religious change. Yet indirectly there was an impact. His main approach to religion was to use enticement by making the adoption of Christianity beneficial. Having begun its growth 300 years before Constantine amidst opposition, the \"Imperial patronage, legal rights to hold property, and financial assistance\", granted to the church by Constantine and those emperors after him who followed his example, were important contributions to the church's success over the next hundred years."]}, {"page": "Lucius Flavius Aper", "response": ["Aper is considered likely to have been the unnamed prefect who is said in the Vita Cari to have urged Carus to make war on Persia, hoping that Carus and Numerian would perish and he himself obtain the Purple.Vita Cari, 8.2; Howe, Op. Cit. It is thus insinuated, but not directly asserted that he was responsible for the death of both men during and after that campaign. The usual caveats are suggested regarding information based on the Augustan History. The truth is unknowable. Historian Pat Southern, points to Aper's scheming as the most likely reason for Carus's unexpected death while campaigning against the Sasanian Empire. ", "A charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without contradiction and the legions with repeated acclamations acknowledged the justice and authority of the Emperor Diocletian.Gibbon: History of the Decline and fall of the Roman Empire, CXIIHistorian Pat Southern described Diocletian's story about Aper's scheming as ridiculous. She argued that although unlikely, it is possible that Aper could have lost his nerve because he feared retribution from suspicious soldiers if Carus had actually died of natural causes, and he claimed that the late emperor's son had also died in the same manner shortly afterwards.

The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used many smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy."]}, {"page": "Triarii", "response": ["According to author Pat Southern, triarii may have evolved from the old first class of the army under the Etruscan kings.

The Imperial historian Tacitus says that the army venerated the standards as if they were gods, and inscriptions record dedications (vota) made on their behalf.CIL 7.1030 is an example of such a dedication from Roman Britain: Drummond and Nelson, The Western Frontiers of Imperial Rome, p. 214; G.R. Watson, The Roman Soldier (Cornell University Press, 1969, 1985), p. 130. The day on which a legion marked the anniversary of its formation was the natalis aquilae, \"the Eagle's birthday,\" in reference to the Roman eagle of the standard.Hooey, \"Rosaliae signorum,\" p. 19; Pat Southern, The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 161; Brian Campbell, The Roman Army, 31 BC\u2013AD 337: A Sourcebook (Routledge, 1994), n.p.

Decorated units displayed gold and silver wreaths on their standards that represented the bestowal of living wreaths, and the Eagles and other signa were garlanded and anointed for lustrations, ceremonies for beginning a campaign, victories, crisis rituals, and Imperial holidays.Pliny, Natural History 13.3.23; Suetonius, Claudius 13; Hooey, \"Rosaliae signorum,\" pp. 17\u201319; Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, pp. 106 (note 16) and 133. Among these occasions was the wedding of the emperor Honorius in 398 AD, described in an epithalamium by Claudian: the military standards are said to grow red with flowers, and the standard-bearers and soldiers ritually shower the imperial bridegroom with flowers purpureoque ... nimbo, in a purple halo.Hooey, \"Rosaliae signorum,\" pp. 18 and 32, citing Claudian 10.187\u2013188 and 295\u2013297. In recounting a mutiny against Claudius in 42 AD, Suetonius avers that divine agency prevented the Eagles from being adorned or pulled from the earth to break camp by the legionaries who had violated their oath (sacramentum); reminded of their religious obligation, they were turned toward repentance (in paenitentiam religione conversis).Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, p. 106, citing Suetonius, Claudius 13. Christian apologists saw the veneration of the signa as central to the religious life of the Roman military, and Minucius Felix tried to demonstrate that because of the cruciform shape, the soldiers had been worshipping the Christian cross without being aware of it.Hooey, \"Rosaliae signorum,\" p. 16, especially note 3, citing Tertullian Apologeticum 16 and Ad nationes 1.12, and Minucius Felix 29.6\u20137; p. 206", "The Tubilustrium was itself a purification ritual. Attested on calendars for both March 23 and May 23, it was perhaps originally monthly.

The March 23 Tubilustrium coincided in the city of Rome with a procession of Mars' armed priests the Salii, who clanged their sacred shields. In the later Empire, it had become assimilated into the \"holy week\" of Attis, occurring on the day when the tree rested at the Temple of the Magna Mater. As a pivotal point in the cycle of death/chaos and (re)birth/order, the day brought together noise rituals of wind and percussion instruments from different traditions, the clamor of the Corybantes or Kouretes who attended Cybele and Attis, and Roman ceremonies of apotropaic trumpet blasts or the beating of shields by the Salian priests,Salzman, On Roman Time,, pp. 166\u2013167.
