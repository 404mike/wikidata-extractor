Notts County dominated the early stages of the match with Bartlett having two shots saved within the first 15 minutes.  They took the lead in the 31st minute: a cross from Bartlett found Johnson whose low strike beat Nixon in the Tranmere goal.  No changes were made by either side to their personnel at half-time.  Bartlett then beat Nixon to the ball and attempted to lob it into the net but Steve Vickers  cleared it.  Steve Cherry, the Notts County goalkeeper, was forced to tip Jim Steel's header over the bar.  In the 63rd minute, a free kick played in by Phil Robinson reached Craig Short at the far post who headed it in to make the score 2\u20130.  With 13 minutes of the game remaining, Johnson ran through the Tranmere defence and was fouled by Steve Mungall and a free kick was awarded. Vickers was shown a yellow card for dissent, claiming it should have been a penalty. Johnson's set piece beat the wall but Nixon pushed the ball onto the goalpost.  David Fairclough was then brought on to replace Mungall and his first significant contribution was to head the ball wide of the goal from  following a McNab cross.  Late in the match, Shaun Garnett was booked for a foul on Lund before the final whistle brought the game to a close with Notts County 2\u20130 winners and gaining promotion to the Second Division.", "|3 ||Shaun Garnett "]}, {"page": "1991 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|6 ||Shaun Garnett"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Shaun Garnett"]}]}}
