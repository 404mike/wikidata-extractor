Unlike earlier artists who worked outside Europe and were employed on voyages of exploration or worked abroad for wealthy, often aristocratic patrons, Earle was able to operate quite independently - able to combine his lust for travel with an ability to earn a living through art. The body of work he produced during his travels comprises a significant documentary record of the effects of European contact and colonisation during the early nineteenth century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Henry Smyth", "response": ["He was the only son of Joseph Smyth (died 1788) and Georgiana Caroline Pitt Pilkington (died 1838), the daughter of John Carteret Pilkington and the granddaughter of Laetitia Pilkington and her husband Matthew Pilkington.

It took time for a distinctly New Zealand literature to develop. The first printing press arrived in New Zealand in 1834, and the first book printed was a M\u0101ori translation of a catechism in 1830 by William Yate, Ko Te Katikihama III. Early New Zealand books were generally narratives of visits and travel to New Zealand, such as A Narrative of a Nine Months' Residence in New Zealand in 1827 (1832) by Augustus Earle or Station Life in New Zealand (1870) by Mary Anne Barker, or scientific works such as The New Zealanders Illustrated, a rare book by natural history artist George French Angas (1847) and A History of the Birds of New Zealand (1872) by ornithologist Walter Buller. Early expressions of New Zealand identity in literature included, notably, Old New Zealand by \"a Pakeha Maori\" (Frederick Edward Maning) and Erewhon by Samuel Butler, which drew on the author's experiences of living in Canterbury for five years."]}, {"page": "Australian art", "response": ["As well as inspiration in natural history, there were some ethnographic portraiture of Aboriginal Australians, particularly in the 1830s.

The officer on watch reported a boat ahead, and Captain FitzRoy ordered \"hands up, shorten sail\". Using a speaking trumpet he questioned Neptune, who would visit them the next morning. About 9 am the next day, the novices or \"griffins\" were assembled in the darkness and heat of the lower deck, then one at a time were blindfolded and led up on deck by \"four of Neptunes constables\", as \"buckets of water were thundered all around\". The first \"griffin\" was Charles Darwin, who noted in his diary how he \"was then placed on a plank, which could be easily tilted up into a large bath of water. \u2014 They then lathered my face & mouth with pitch and paint, & scraped some of it off with a piece of roughened iron hoop. \u2014a signal being given I was tilted head over heels into the water, where two men received me & ducked me. \u2014at last, glad enough, I escaped. \u2014 most of the others were treated much worse, dirty mixtures being put in their mouths & rubbed on their faces. \u2014 The whole ship was a shower bath: & water was flying about in every direction: of course not one person, even the Captain, got clear of being wet through.\" The ship's artist, Augustus Earle, made a sketch of the scene."]}, {"page": "John Clements Wickham", "response": ["Wickham transferred to the Beagle in 1831 as First Lieutenant, under Captain Robert Fitzroy and first officer Philip Parker King (1791\u20131856), to complete the survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, as part of a circumnavigation of the globe.

The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to Tierra del Fuego on Beagle together with the missionary Richard Matthews.", "While he continued to get acquainted with FitzRoy, going shopping together, Darwin rushed around to arrange his supplies and equipment, getting advice from experts on specimen preservation such as William Yarrell at the Zoological Society of London, Robert Brown at the British Museum, Captain Phillip Parker King who led the first expedition, and invertebrate anatomist Robert Edmond Grant who had tutored Darwin at Edinburgh. Yarrell gave invaluable advice and bargained with shopkeepers, so Darwin paid \u00a350 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent \u00a3400 on firearms., On Sunday, 11 September, FitzRoy and Darwin took the steam packet for Portsmouth. Darwin was not seasick and had a pleasant \"sail of three days\".

On Friday, Darwin rushed back to London, \"250 miles in 24 hours\", and on via Cambridge to arrive in Shrewsbury on 22 September for a last quick visit to family and friends, leaving for London on 2 October. Delays to Beagle gave Darwin an extra week to consult experts and complete packing his baggage.

They sailed south, putting in at Port Desire on 23 December, and the following day Darwin shot a guanaco which provided them with a Christmas meal. Early in the new year, Martens shot a rhea which they enjoyed eating before Darwin realised that this was the elusive smaller rhea and preserved the remains. On 9 January\u00a01834,  further south, they reached Port St Julian and exploring the local geology in cliffs near the harbour Darwin found fossils of pieces of spine and a hind leg of \"some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon\". On 26 January, they entered the Straits of Magellan, and at St. Gregory's Bay, they met half-civilised Patagonian \"giants\" over  tall, described by Darwin as \"excellent practical naturalists\". One told him that the smaller rheas were the only species this far south, while the larger rheas kept to the north, the species meeting around the Rio Negro.", "On 19 December, they reached New Zealand, where Darwin thought the tattooed M\u0101ori to be savages with the character of a much lower order than the Tahitians. He also noted that they and their homes were \"filthily dirty and offensive\". Darwin saw missionaries bringing improvement in character, as well as new farming practices with an exemplary \"English farm\" employing natives. Richard Matthews was left here with his elder brother Joseph Matthews who was a missionary at Kaitaia. Darwin and FitzRoy were agreed that missionaries had been unfairly misrepresented in tracts, particularly one written by the artist Augustus Earle which he had left on the ship. Darwin also noted many English residents of the most worthless character, including runaway convicts from New South Wales.
