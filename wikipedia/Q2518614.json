The son of a Wesleyan Methodist minister, he qualified as a solicitor, and successfully specialised in industrial insurance. He became a member of the London County Council and then a Member of Parliament.\nWood served as junior minister to Neville Chamberlain at the Ministry of Health, establishing a close personal and political alliance. His first cabinet post was Postmaster General, in which he transformed the British Post Office from a bureaucracy to a business. As Secretary of State for Air in the months before the Second World War he oversaw a huge increase in the production of warplanes to bring Britain up to parity with Germany. When Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, Wood was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which post he adopted policies propounded by John Maynard Keynes, changing the role of HM Treasury from custodian of government income and expenditure to steering the entire British economy.\nOne of Wood's last innovations was the creation of Pay As You Earn, under which income tax is deducted from employees' current pay, rather than being collected retrospectively. This system remains in force in Britain. Wood died suddenly on the day on which the new system was to be announced to Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stanley Baldwin", "response": ["* Sir Kingsley Wood \u2013 Minister of Health"]}, {"page": "Chancellor of the Exchequer", "response": ["| Sir Kingsley Wood"]}, {"page": "Hayes, Hillingdon", "response": ["* 1938 view of Sir Kingsley Wood visiting Fairey Aviation, Hayes"]}, {"page": "Postmaster General of the United Kingdom", "response": ["| rowspan=2|Sir Kingsley WoodMP for Woolwich West Sat in Cabinet from 20 December 1933"]}, {"page": "Phoney War", "response": ["When Leopold Amery suggested to Kingsley Wood that the Black Forest be bombed with incendiaries to burn its ammunition dumps, Wood\u2014the Secretary of State for Air\u2014amazed the member of parliament by responding that the forest was \"private property\" and could not be bombed; neither could weapons factories, as the Germans might do the same.
