The team were positioned in 4th place needing 3rd to secure a play off place. A huge game away to Newry City followed with three points for the men in red securing a pre play off spot against Newry. The game saw a large and loud travelling support come down in what was effectively a cup final game that ultimately ended 0\u20130 with a red card for Jamie Douglas and the visitors ultimately coming up short.
