Entertainment Weekly called the character's relationship with her parents \"esteem-sucking\".

Chelsea Mize of Bustle observed that Monica and Ross' \"wacky quirks become all the more understandable after ... seeing them with their parents.\" Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010 author Vincent Terrance believes that Monica's competitive nature originates from having grown up constantly competing with Ross. Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive described Monica and Ross' relationship as \"A blend of love and sibling jealousy with an urge to irritate each other to the deepest core of existence\", with Ross often making fun of his sister's weight and Monica teasing him about his several failed marriages in return. In terms of ethnicity, Crane confirmed that both Monica and Ross are half-Jewish, with their father being Jewish and their mother being of non-Jewish European ancestry. However, Television's Changing Image of American Jews categorized Monica as a \"masked\" Jew, explaining that \"the smart, funny, and insecure Ross seems more Jewish\" than Monica, who the author dismissed as \"china-doll like\" in appearance and demeanor.

Ross gets divorced and is newly single in first episode because his wife, Carol (Jane Sibbett), has realized she's a lesbian. Later in the series, he dates Rachel, but they split up when he sleeps with another woman the night they decide their relationship is \"on a break\". After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross marries Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), the niece of Rachel's boss. However, because Ross says \"I take thee Rachel\" instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn't last long. In season 5, Ross and Rachel drunkenly marry in Las Vegas, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well; however, they confess that if they ever got married properly it would be the one that lasted. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced three times.

Teela's costume in the film is quite different from its animated depictions. It is more of a gray colored jump suit.
