Paul Willis's run down the right side ended in a cross to the back post where Austin McCann volleyed in from close range. It was his first goal in over 100 appearances for Dunfermline. Hibs fought back, but were unable to make a clear-cut chance. Kirk and Dowie then both went close in quick succession though Dunfermline never looked like adding to their tally. Hibs piled on the pressure with good saves by Gallacher from Leigh Griffiths's efforts. However, the visitors held on for the third 1\u20130 away victory of the season. Final score 1\u20130</", "From the very start the home side dominated with several chances in the first half. Jim Goodwin's low shot from 30 yards was parried away by Paul Gallacher, then a few minutes later a driven shot came back off Paul Burns in the penalty box which brought appeals for a penalty, but were waved away by the ref. Shortly after, a free-kick was trapped under Burns as he tried to clear and another shout for a penalty came, but once again were ignored. Gallacher was forced into more saves, but the pressure told as Nigel Hasselbaink burst through the defence as Gallacher narrowed the angle, he squared across the goal mouth to Kenny McLean, who tapped in from a yard out. Stephen Thompson then had too efforts magnificently saved by Gallacher as St Mirren pushed for a second. Dunfermline then had their first proper chance with a superb Paul Willis cross met by Ryan Thomson who headed just wide. Austin McCann took too much time on the ball and was punished when he lost possession to Stephen Thompson and his pass to Hasselbaink was smashed into the net. After half time to game calmed down, with less chances for either side. Joe Cardle came off the bench and made an immediate impact. His cross evaded everyone and came back off the post only to strike Saints keeper Craig Samson and roll into the net. Cardle then nearly equalised with a drive which was well saved by Samson. However, the home side comfortably held onto their position till the end of the game. Final Score 1\u20132</", "An already hard task away at one of the Old Firm was made harder in just over 5 minutes, when Paul Willis played a backwards pass straight to Gary Hooper who took two touches into the box and fired home across the box into the bottom left hand corner. Alex Keddie then gave the ball away on the half-way line and Jamie Forrest, Hooper and Kris Commons combined to switch the ball across to the left hand side to Anthony Stokes. He drove low at goal and Paul Gallacher's parry reached Hooper who flicked it backwards to Forrest, who smashed in into the roof of the net. A long range drive from Biram Kayal was then saved by Gallacher's stretched leg. Dunfermline then had a penalty appeal turned away after Daniel Majstorovi\u0107 climbed over the back off Ryan Thomson. Celtic continued to look for a second and Gallacher and Keddie combined to keep out Commons after a low cross from the left by Stokes. Stokes then somehow missed from two yards out, mistiming his back post volley. In the second half Paul Burns felled Forrest in the box, to give away a penalty. Ki then sent Gallacher the wrong way, but hit the outside of the post, from the spot. Stokes then missed a one-on-one chance, hitting the post again. Joe Cardle went close for the Pars, cutting inside from the left forcing Fraser Forster into a good low save. He then made another as Liam Buchanan was sent through, but the keep was out fast to block the attempted chip. David Graham then laid off Andrew Barrowman in the right hand corner of the box, and his low drive across goal found the net. Final score 1\u20132</", "The visitors started strongly, on a day with hollowing gales swirling through the stadium, with some early chances. Rory Fallon just failed to make contact with a low cross and Josh Magennis somehow failed to score in a goalmouth scramble. He then vented his anger by shoving the home keeper in the chest and full in the face. However, the referee inexplicably decided that the violent conduct from him merited only a yellow card. The home fans were even more infuriated when Paul Willis tried to take a quick free-kick, and apparently was deemed to have committed an equal offence as Magennis, so was yellow carded for his effort. Andy Kirk should have hit the target with a turning snap-shot, and David Graham was also guilty of missing the target with a close range diving header after an excellent move by Dufermline. Aberdeen were looking dangerous from set-pieces and deservedly took the lead right on half-time with a header by Andrew Considine from a Fraser Fyvie corner. Paddy Boyle was then lucky to escape with a yellow after his two-footed challenge on Fyvie. Dunfermline then equalised from a Graham corner, Andrew Barrowman's header was blocked on the line, but he was first on hand to put away the rebound. Then, from Willis's superb diagonal ball, Graham cut inside from the left and rifled inside the near post of David Gonzalez to take the lead. Aberdeen nearly stuck back straight away with Youl Mawene keeping the ball away from Paul Gallacher and cutting it back, only for Magennis to miss the target with no keeper in the goal. Boyle did well to turn past the defenders and force in shot which was parried to Liam Buchanan, whose first touch coming on as a sub was to make it 3\u20131. Immediately from the restart Gallacher saved one-on-one with Magennis, showing Aberdeen could score again. From a quick Martin Hardie free-kick, Buchanan cut the ball back and Barrowman looked odds on the score, only for Gonzalez to somehow tip his point blank range onto the post. Straight away Aberdeen won a corner and from it Alex Keddie headed in an own goal. From then on it was all Aberdeen, and the visitors final scored a fourth. From a long throw-in Magennis managed to turn a smash home the equaliser. Final score 3\u20133.</", "| Paul Willis", "|Paul Willis"]}, {"page": "Kingston FC", "response": ["Muldoon added international experience to the roster for the 2014 season.
