Serving as an ordinary soldier for three years before being sent for officer training in 1926, slow peacetime career progression saw Ward achieving the rank of captain only in 1937. However, the Second World War, which began just two years later, allowed him to demonstrate his high ability as both a staff officer and a commander of troops in the field. Receiving command of the 4th Infantry Division at the unusually young age of 39 years and 3 months, he led the division in Italy and Greece from 1944 to 1945. After the war ended in 1945, Ward went on to hold several staff and field appointments at the highest levels, including Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine, retiring as a full general in 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "15th Army Group", "response": ["**** 22px British 4th Infantry Division - (Major-General Alfred Dudley Ward)"]}, {"page": "4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["The division arrived on the Italian Front in late February 1944, relieving the British 46th Infantry Division, initially coming under command of Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery's British X Corps, then serving under the U.S. Fifth Army.
