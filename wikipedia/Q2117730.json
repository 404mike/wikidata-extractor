He turned professional in 1995. He married his childhood sweetheart Victoria in 2004.\nDrysdale currently competes on the European Tour, having graduated through qualifying school for the fourth time at the end of 2008. He had previously qualified for the elite tour in 2001, 2006 and 2007 through q-school, in addition to graduating directly from the Challenge Tour in 2004, when he finished 12th on the end of season rankings, largely thanks to a sudden death playoff victory over Mattias Eliasson at the Bouygues Telecom Grand Final.\nPrior to 2009, Drysdale's best finish on the European Tour had been as runner-up at the 2006 Russian Open. In March 2009, he equalled that when he finished second in the Open de Andalucia. That result in Spain followed a third place in the Joburg Open earlier in the season, allowed Drysdale to  qualify for the season ending Dubai World Championship. He finished the season inside the top 50 on the Race to Dubai, to comfortably retain his card for the 2010 season.\nIn October 2009, he briefly became the highest ranked Scottish golfer in the Official World Golf Ranking.\nIn the 2012 season on the European Tour, Drysdale's best finishes were a 3rd place in the Joburg Open, 7th at the Irish Open, and 10th at the BMW PGA Championship. He was well inside the top 60 of the European Tour Race to Dubai finishing 48th.\nThe 2013 season saw Drysdale finish 6th at the Avantha Masters, and 10th at the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles. His final position on the Race to Dubai of 80th was more than good enough to retain his playing rights for the 2014 season.\nIn 2014, a back injury at the start of the season caused Drysdale to pull out of the Nelson Mandela Championship. He finished 8th at The Championship at Laguna National in May, his first top-10 of the season. At the ISPS Handa Perth International in October, he had to finish in the top 7 to retain his European Tour card for 2015. On the last putt on the 18th green, Drysdale holed a 30-foot putt to finish 4th place and secure his card for the following season finishing 102 on the 2014 Race to Dubai.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Qatar Masters", "response": ["| 2020 || EUR ||  Jorge Campillo || align=center|271 || align=center |\u221213 || Playoff ||   David Drysdale || Education City"]}, {"page": "Scottish PGA Championship", "response": ["| 2005 || Paul Lawrie (2) ||  || Gleneagles (PGA Centenary) || 275 || 4 strokes ||  David Drysdale || align=center|8,700 || "]}, {"page": "Russian Open", "response": ["| 2006 || EUR ||  Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares || align=center|266 || align=center|\u221222 || 4 strokes ||  David Drysdale || align=center|130,642 "]}, {"page": "Alfred Dunhill Championship", "response": ["|style=\"background:lightblue\"|19th || 2018 || AFR, EUR ||  David Lipsky || align=\"center\" |274 || align=center|\u221214 || 2 strokes ||  David Drysdale || Leopard Creek"]}, {"page": "S\u00f8ren Kjeldsen", "response": ["Kjeldsen won his third European Tour event and second consecutive event on Spanish soil with a three stroke victory over David Drysdale at the 2009 Open de Andalucia in Marbella, Andalusia, Spain.
