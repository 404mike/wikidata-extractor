He reasoned that \"when you race against time, you don't have to sprint. Others can't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.\" Archie Macpherson stated that \"with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.\" Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running. Peter Lovesey wrote in The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners that Nurmi \"accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.\" Cordner Nelson, founder of Track & Field News, credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: \"His imprint on the track world was greater than any man\u2019s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.\""]}, {"page": "Islington", "response": ["* The Royal Agricultural Hall on Liverpool Road features as the location for a Victorian walking match in Peter Lovesey\u2019s novel  Wobble to Death, (1970) and its BBC Radio's Saturday Night Theatre adaptation."]}, {"page": "Historical mystery", "response": ["In 1970 Peter Lovesey began a series of novels featuring Sergeant Cribb, a Victorian-era police detective, and Elizabeth Peters's Amelia Peabody series (1975\u20132010) followed the adventures of the titular  Victorian lady/archaeologist as she solved mysteries surrounding her excavations in early 20th century Egypt. But historical mystery stories remained an oddity until the late 1970s, with the success of Ellis Peters and her Cadfael Chronicles (1977\u20131994), featuring Benedictine monk Brother Cadfael and set in 12th century Shrewsbury. Umberto Eco's one-off The Name of the Rose (1980) also helped popularize the concept, and starting in 1979, author Anne Perry wrote two series of Victorian era mysteries featuring Thomas Pitt (1979\u20132013) and William Monk (1990\u20132013). However it was not until about 1990 that the genre's popularity expanded significantly with works such as Lindsey Davis's Falco novels (1989\u20132010), set in the Roman Empire of Vespasian; John Maddox Roberts's SPQR series (1990\u20132010) and Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa novels (1991\u20132010), both set in the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC; and Paul Doherty's various series, including the Hugh Corbett medieval mysteries (1986\u20132010), the Sorrowful Mysteries of Brother Athelstan (1991\u20132012), and the Canterbury Tales of Mystery and Murder (1994\u20132012). For Mike Ashley'sThe Mammoth Book of Historical Detectives (1995), F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre wrote \"Death in the Dawntime\", a locked room mystery (or rather, sealed cave mystery) set in Australia around 35,000 BC, which Ashley suggests is the furthest in the past a historical mystery has been set to date. Diana Gabaldon began the Lord John series in 1998, casting a recurring secondary character from her Outlander series, Lord John Grey, as a nobleman-military officer-amateur detective in 18th century England.Lord John first appears in Gabaldon's Dragonfly in Amber (1992), but the 1998 novella Lord John and the Hellfire Club is the character's first appearance as a detective.
