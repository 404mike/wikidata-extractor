Born in Droylsden in Lancashire, Lord spent his early years living in a community of textile mill-workers. His main carpet factory was at Donaghadee in the north of County Down in Ulster. This factory was largely designed by Billy McAlister, a Belfast architect, and his team.\nLord was married three times. In 1936 he married Bessie Greenwood, and they had one son and two daughters before divorcing in 1959. In 1960, he married the author and journalist Shirley Florence Hussey (n\u00e9e Stringer, later married to journalist Abe Rosenthal) with whom he had one son. They divorced in 1973. In 1974 Lord married Aileen Parnell, widow of the impresario Val Parnell.\nIn the 1960s Lord sold some expensive rugs to film and television producer William Dozier, and was paid by a cameo appearance in the TV series Batman.The Cyril Lord group of companies collapsed at the end of 1968 shortly after Lord's resignation as chairman on the grounds of ill-health.The TV advertising jingle \"This is luxury you can afford from Cyril Lord\" was very well known in the 1960s. It was parodied in the song \"I'm Bored\" by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band as \"This is boredom you can afford from Cyril Bored\" (following a series of other word alterations, such as \"drawing bored\", \"bored-ello\", and \"mortar bored\") on their debut album Gorilla (1967).\nDuring his time living and working in Northern Ireland, Lord lived on Warren Road on the outskirts of Donaghadee, by the Irish Sea. In May 1984, following a long illness, he died at his home in Barbados.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Fisher (politician)", "response": ["Before leaving university, Fisher had numerous low-paying jobs, including: working in a Cyril Lord carpet factory in Northern Ireland, as a waiter, as a kitchen porter, as a caddie on a golf course, insulating roofs, on a travelling fairground and as a folk singer and guitarist."]}, {"page": "Droylsden", "response": ["Cyril Lord (1911-1984), 'the Carpet King', was born and raised in Droylsden.

Early in his career he was vulnerable to being out-muscled by opposition players (leading his teammates to nickname him 'Cyril' after Cyril Lord the carpet salesman, as Ron Greenwood told him \"you're always on the floor\"). He lacked pace, leading to another nickname, Boog, after a slow baseball player called Boog Powell the team had witnessed during a tour of the USA. He was rarely booked or sent off during his West Ham career and due to his gentlemanly approach to the game where he rarely contested a referee's decision he picked up another nickname, Hadleigh, after a television upper class and urbane detective played by Gerald Harper."]}, {"page": "Acts of the claimant", "response": ["But where the claimant\u2019s response is not sufficiently unreasonable, the chain of causation will be unbroken and the defendant will remain liable.

The claimant also wore bifocals and the collar inhibited the normal compensatory movement of her head to maintain perfect vision. She fell down some steps sustaining further injury.
