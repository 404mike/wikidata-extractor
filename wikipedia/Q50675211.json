However, the methods were exposed on 27 September 2016 during a presentation by Alexander Nix named \"The Power of Big Data and Psychographics\". Nix was the chief executive officer of market-research at Cambridge Analytica. After founding the company in 2013 he was then suspended on 20 March 2018 following the release of a video in which he admitted to working directly with Donald Trump to gather data on the US electorate. In his 2016 presentation, Nix highlights his contribution the 2016 Ted Cruz campaign and how taking the focus away from demographics and geographics for the targeted ads and instead using psychographics in order to target personality traits and get a better understanding of voter demands is a more effective method of gaining votes. In 2016, one of Nix's business associates, Steve Bannon, left the company to take over the campaign of Donald Trump and as a result of the video leak which lost Nix his job it is largely believed he had direct influence too. As well as this, Cambridge Analytica staff were also heavily involved in the Vote-Leave campaign for the 2016 Brexit referendum. As a result of an organisation specialised in targeted ads being involved in two populist campaigns that produced shock results, many point out as a potential threat to democracy."]}, {"page": "OMR Festival", "response": ["The OMR Festival 2017 took place on March 2 and 3, 2017 in three halls at the Hamburg Exhibition Center.

Because Cambridge Analytica processed user data via SCL in Britain, Carroll's complaints fell under British jurisdiction.
