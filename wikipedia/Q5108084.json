However, after victory over Port Vale in the FA Cup in December 2007, he turned professional at Vale Park. He spent eleven months in the English Football League, before returning to Chasetown. He helped the club to win promotion in 2010, and went on to beat the club's all-time appearance record.

However, hours later, confusion arose when Sinnott denied resigning. Five days later he was named the new Port Vale manager, ending the speculation about his future. Prominent backroom staff member Dean Glover had hoped to gain the management spot himself, and so pondered resigning from the club, but eventually chose to remain as Sinnott's assistant. The only significant staff member Sinnott was allowed to bring in was scout Steve Joesbury. In his first league game in charge Vale lost to local rivals Crewe Alexandra. Sinnott achieved his first win in charge of the club at Morecambe in the FA Cup First Round, with Port Vale winning 2\u20130. However the Second Round held embarrassment for both Sinnott and the club, as Southern League side Chasetown (an eighth tier team 101 league places below the Vale) picked up a 1\u20131 draw at Vale Park, before making a giant-killing with a late goal on their home ground, after Luke Rodgers missed two penalties. Sinnott warned of big changes at the club. He signed Chasetown duo Chris Slater and Kyle Perry, and heavily exploited the loan market. He ultimately proved unable to save the club from relegation, and they were relegated on 12 April 2008. With only 38 points from 46 games, they finished ahead of bottom-placed Luton Town only thanks to a ten-point deduction inflicted upon Luton.

Sinnott then signed Dave Mulligan from Scunthorpe United on a short-term contract. Midfielder David Howland also arrived on loan from Birmingham City, and would join the club permanently at the end of the season. Fellow Birmingham player Krystian Pearce also signed on loan, though would impress enough to win a longer stay with Birmingham. Sinnott then raided another Birmingham club, this time Aston Villa, to bring Australian teenager Chris Herd on a one-month loan, as well as Swedish youngster Tobias Mikaelsson. He also allowed Rocastle to join Gillingham on a two-week loan. Sinnott also completed the signings of Chasetown pair Chris Slater and Kyle Perry, who left their jobs to become full-time professional footballers. In February, O'Loughlin was loaned out to Hinckley United. After the club lost a 2\u20130 lead at Victoria Park to lose 3\u20132 against Hartlepool United, club legend Jon McCarthy questioned the team's mental strength. In April, Craig Rocastle's contract was terminated by mutual consent, and he moved to play for Greek club Thrasyvoulos.
