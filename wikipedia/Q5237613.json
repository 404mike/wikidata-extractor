Miskelly spent the majority of his playing career in Northern Ireland with Portadown making 441 appearances until being forced to retire in December 2016 due to injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portadown F.C.", "response": ["Arkins won his first official match in charge as interim manager in a 2\u20131 win against Ballinamallard United with goals from Stephen Hughes and a penalty from Niall Henderson. It was followed up with a 3\u20131 win over Ards with goals from Robert Garrett, Stephen Hughes and Brendan Shannon scoring his first goal for the club from the penalty spot. However, it was later found that the club had fielded midfielder Robert Garrett, who was supposed to be serving a one-game ban with Ards officials informing the club that they believed that Garrett was suspended.Ards were subsequently awarded a 3\u20130 win with the Ports being fined \u00a3500. Arkins left the club following a 0\u20135 defeat to Linfield at an extremely foggy Shamrock Park. On 5 December 2016, Portadown-born Niall Currie was appointed as manager after successfully agreeing his release from Ards with him and his loyal assistant Jay Willis joining the club. Upon his first match against Cliftonville at Solitude, they were defeated 1\u20130 with a goal from Levi Ives the decider. Prior to the match, it was announced that longtime goalkeeper David Miskelly would be retiring immediately due to a shoulder injury sustained the previous season after serving 12 years and making over 400 appearances with the club.", "What followed was a run of fixtures that was of huge importance which started with a well deserved 2\u20131 win over Loughgall with many thinking that the team had hit form at just the right time, and provided consistent results in the \"next nine cup finals\" a play off position would almost certainly materialise. The positivity was quickly eroded however following a 1\u20130 defeat away to Ballyclare Comrades in the first of nine crucial fixtures and what was the 4th defeat that season to Ballyclare. The following fixture saw a 0\u20130 draw with the Welders in a game where the Ports, with so much riding on every game created virtually nothing worth noting the whole day. The game saw the end of Niall Curries tenure as Portadown manager who was relieved of his duties following the result. In February 2018 it was confirmed that Portadown had made an approach and had been successful in appointing ex striker and Warrenpoint Town boss Matthew Tipton with David Miskelly joining as his assistant."]}, {"page": "Michael Ingham (footballer)", "response": ["Ingham was capped once for Northern Ireland at under-18 level, making his only appearance in a 2\u20131 home defeat to the Republic of Ireland on 9 March 1999 in 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After being understudy to David Miskelly for two under-21 matches in 2000, Ingham made his debut in a 2\u20130 home defeat to the Czech Republic on 23 March 2001 in 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Having made his last under-21 appearance in a 4\u20130 defeat to the Czech Republic on 5 June 2001 in another qualifier, his international career at this level concluded with four caps. Ingham was called into the senior Northern Ireland squad in August 2002 after Roy Carroll was released. He was called into the Northern Ireland B squad in May 2003, but was forced to withdraw because of injury. Ingham's form during a loan at Wrexham saw him placed on standby for Northern Ireland's match with Serbia and Montenegro in April 2004. He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for their tour of the Caribbean in May 2004, but dislocated a finger in training in June, which meant he missed out on making his debut."]}, {"page": "Miskelly, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Miskelly"]}]}}
