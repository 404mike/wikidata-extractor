He was an associate member of the Old Society of Painters in Water-colours, where he exhibited as William Evans of Bristol. Born in Bristol, in his early years he was a pupil of Francis Danby and associated with the artists of the Bristol School.Wishing to perfect his art by the study of nature alone, and to free himself from the influence of schools or individuals, Evans made himself a home for many years in the centre of a grand gorge of mountain scenery in North Wales, at a farm called Tyn-y-Cai, in a large park at the junction of the River Lledr with the River Conwy, near Betws-y-Coed. Here he was able to cultivate a natural impulse for originality and grandeur in the constant contemplation of nature in some of its wildest forms, and he produced some fine works, notably Traeth Mawr; his treatment of the mountain torrents and the cottage scenery of the neighbourhood was also remarkable. William James M\u00fcller, a friend from his Bristol days, joined him in painting this area on a visit of  1842.After 1852 Evans visited Italy, spending the winter successively at Genoa, Rome, and Naples, and he collected numerous materials for working up into landscapes of a very different character from his earlier productions.His work was cut short by illness, and he died in Marylebone Road, London, on 7 December 1858, aged 49. There is a fine water-colour drawing by him in the print room at the British Museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["***David William Evans (1866\u20131926), Welsh lawyer, public servant and rugby international", "**John William Evans (geologist) (1857\u20131930), British geologist", "**John William Evans (rugby player) (1875\u20131947), Welsh rugby union forward", "***Thomas William Evans (1821\u20131892), High Sheriff of Derbyshire and MP", "***William Evans (divine) (died c. 1720), Welsh Presbyterian divine", "***William Evans (British Army officer), British Army officer during the War of Spanish Succession", "***William Evans (lexicographer) (died 1776), Welsh minister and lexicographer", "***William Evans (1788\u20131856), British MP for North Derbyshire", "***William Evans (watercolourist) (1798\u20131877), William Evans of Eton, English artist", "***William Evans (priest) (1801\u20131869), divine and naturalist", "***William Evans (landscape painter) (1811\u20131858), William Evans of Bristol, English artist", "***Sir William Evans, 1st Baronet (1821\u20131892), British Liberal politician and benefactor", "***William Evans (judge) (1846/7\u20131918), Welsh judge and legal author", "***William Evans (Medal of Honor) (1851\u20131881), American Indian Wars soldier", "***William Evans (footballer) (1853\u20131919), Wales international footballer", "***William Evans (Australian politician) (1856\u20131914), Australian union leader and politician", "***William Evans (Australian sportsman) (1876\u20131964), Queensland cricketer and rugby union player", "***William Evans (English cricketer) (1883\u20131913), South African-born English all-round cricketer", "***William Evans (rugby player born 1883) (1883\u20131946), Welsh international rugby player", "***William Evans (Wil Ifan) (1883\u20131968), Welsh poet and Archdruid", "***William Evans (cardiologist) (1895\u20131988), Welsh cardiologist and publisher", "*** William Evans (1920\u20132013), American musician a.k.a.
