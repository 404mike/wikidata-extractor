Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech \"became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had the sense of a suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a second or two to flash through the character's mind, like a bad dream.\"Shakespeare Survey, 41 (1988) Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes \"we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience.\"Dessen (1988: 60)", "A celebrated, and unedited production, (according to Jonathan Bate, not a single line from Q1 was cut) was directed by Deborah Warner in 1987 at The Swan and remounted at Barbican's Pit in 1988 for the RSC, starring Brian Cox as Titus, Estelle Kohler as Tamora, Peter Polycarpou as Aaron and Sonia Ritter as Lavinia. Met with almost universally positive reviews, Jonathan Bate regards it as the finest production of any Shakespearean play of the entire 1980s.Bate (1996: 1) Using a small cast, Warner had her actors address the audience from time to time throughout the play and often had actors leave the stage and wander out into the auditorium. Opting for a realist presentation, the play had a warning posted in the pit \"This play contains scenes which some people may find disturbing,\" and numerous critics noted how, after the interval at many shows, empty seats had appeared in the audience.An extensive overview of this production can be found in Dessen (1989: 57\u201370) Warner's production was considered so successful, both critically and commercially, that the RSC did not stage the play again until 2003.Hughes (2006: 47n1)"]}, {"page": "St Catherine's College, Oxford", "response": ["*2019: Deborah Warner "]}, {"page": "2000 in film", "response": ["| The Last September || Trimark Pictures / UGC DA International || Deborah Warner (director); John Banville (screenplay); Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Keeley Hawes, David Tennant, Lambert Wilson, Jane Birkin, Fiona Shaw, Jonathan Slinger, Richard Roxburgh, Tom Hickey, Gary Lydon, Emily Nagle, Lesley McGuire || Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Royal National Theatre", "response": ["* Hedda Gabler starring Fiona Shaw, directed by Deborah Warner (1993)"]}, {"page": "Royal Shakespeare Company", "response": ["* Titus Andronicus directed by Deborah Warner starring Brian Cox (1988)"]}, {"page": "Fiona Shaw", "response": ["Shaw notably played the male lead in Richard II, directed by Deborah Warner in 1995.
