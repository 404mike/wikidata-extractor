Krikken joined Derbyshire in the 1987 season and was the club's first-choice wicket-keeper for most of his career after displacing Bernie Maher in the side. He was also a lower-order right-handed batsman.\nAfter his retirement, he became Derbyshire's Academy Coach in late 2003, having earned the ECB's Level 4 Coaching Certificate. Krikken was appointed as the club's Head Coach in June 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dominic Cork", "response": ["However, Derbyshire at this point in the club's history was beset with internal divisions, stemming from the resignation two years earlier of Dean Jones from the captaincy.  Such was the internal strife during that 1998 season that England's chairman of selectors David Graveney left Cork out of the 1999 World Cup squad, citing that the issues at Derbyshire were playing too heavily on Cork's mind to allow him to play international cricket. Before the start of the 1999 season, Cork demanded the Derbyshire committee return a number of powers to the captaincy, and when his demands went unfulfilled he threatened to resign from the county altogether.  Allied with Cork in the dispute were teammates Kim Barnett and Karl Krikken. Cork carried out his threat and asked to be released from the remainder of the four seasons left on his contract.  However Derbyshire refused to terminate the contract. Six months after the dispute began, the Derbyshire committee gave into Cork's demands allowing him more say over playing matters, coupled with the departure of Andy Hayhurst and Harold Rhodes from administration positions at the county, both of whom Cork cited as making his captaincy untenable.  The internal divisions between Cork and the county management soon became public knowledge, with former players like Ian Blackwell vocal of Cork's captaincy methods and his \"negative\" impact on the dressing room. During the dispute his form began to suffer, and another injury in 2001 did not help his case.  He was awarded a benefit year in 2001, with some of his benefit events being boycotted by the Derbyshire committee; this was a season in which Cork's appearances were limited to just a handful by his England duties and return to the England one-day side."]}, {"page": "Andrew Bairstow", "response": ["Bairstow started his career within the Worcestershire Second XI, before moving to Derbyshire, and it was a surprise when the Peakites, without the relative experience of Karl Krikken and defensive technique of Steve Griffiths, called upon the young Bairstow as their cover man. Following his inconspicuous First-class career, Bairstow was to make few appearances in even the Second XI, despite being only nineteen and still relatively green to the game."]}, {"page": "Adrian Rollins", "response": ["An imposing presence, measuring 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in and weighing around sixteen stone, Rollins made his debut for Derbyshire as an emergency wicket-keeper in the absence of teammates Bernie Maher and Karl Krikken, making him possibly the tallest wicket-keeper in first-class cricket history. Rollins became the 500th first-class cricketer for the Derbyshire team, as well as the 100th to make a first-class century, following his milestone innings with a hugely impressive innings of 200 in nine hours, the single longest innings in Derbyshire's history."]}, {"page": "Bernie Maher", "response": ["After a number of years in the role of Wicketkeeper Opening /Batsman in 1990 Maher was replaced as a regular by Karl Krikken. Maher took on the role of Derbyshire second team coach in 1990, but he was on call for the first team, and played a large part of the 1993 season for the first team due to injuries, his final game being against Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1993. Maher stayed as player-coach until 1995 when a lower back injury forced his retirement."]}, {"page": "Brian Krikken", "response": ["He is the father of Karl Krikken, who had a long career with Derbyshire."]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 8th || 198 ||  Karl Krikken Dominic Cork || v Lancashire || Manchester || 1996"]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|1990|| 24 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 12 ||16 ||12 ||3 ||1 ||bgcolor=gold| 1|| R2|| Grp ||Kim Barnett ||Kim Barnett ||  Ian Bishop || Karl Krikken", "|1993|| 19 || 4 || 7 || 8 || 15 ||17 || 7 || 8 || 2 || 11|| R2 ||bgcolor=gold|W ||Kim Barnett || John Morris || Devon Malcolm || Karl Krikken", "|1997|| 20 || 5 || 9 || 6 || 16 || 17 || 4 || 9|| 4|| 14 ||QF ||Grp ||Dean Jones  || Kim Barnett || Devon Malcolm || Karl Krikken"]}, {"page": "2012 County Championship", "response": ["| Karl Krikken"]}, {"page": "2012 Twenty20 Cup", "response": ["|Karl Krikken"]}, {"page": "2013 Twenty20 Cup", "response": ["| Karl Krikken"]}, {"page": "2013 County Championship", "response": ["| Karl Krikken"]}]}}
