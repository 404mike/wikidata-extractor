While studying in Oxford University (Worcester College) for his D.Phil under the supervision of Michael Dummett, he identified the preface paradox. In belief revision he created the AGM account of theory change with Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n and Peter G\u00e4rdenfors. In modal logic and other non-classical logics, he showed how to establish completeness results by adapting the method of maximal consistent set. In 1969 Makinson discovered the first simple and natural propositional logic lacking the finite model property. Together with Leon van der Torre he developed input/output logic.", "* David Makinson's website"]}, {"page": "Makinson", "response": ["*David Makinson (born 1941), Australian logician", "*David Makinson (cricketer) (born 1961),  English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Cumberland County Cricket Club List A players", "response": ["* David Makinson, 3 matches, 1992\u20131995"]}]}}
