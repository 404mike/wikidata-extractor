Harlan Ellison, a creative consultant on the show, received story credits for two episodes.

The Ditchling group developed a journal called The Game, in which they expressed many Chestertonian principles, particularly anti-industrialism and an advocacy of religious family life.

Michael Collins \u2013 The Lost Leader, Gill & MacMillan, p. 35. Collins's favourite work of Chesterton was The Napoleon of Notting Hill, and he was \"almost fanatically attached to it\", according to his friend Sir William Darling. His column in the Illustrated London News on 18 September 1909 had a profound effect on Mahatma Gandhi. P. N. Furbank asserts that Gandhi was \"thunderstruck\" when he read it, while Martin Green notes that \"Gandhi was so delighted with this that he told Indian Opinion to reprint it.\" Another convert was Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who said that the book What's Wrong with the World changed his life in terms of ideas and religion.Marchand, Philip (1998).

L. Mencken, Joseph Hergesheimer, and Jack Woodford. Although now largely forgotten by the general public, his work was remarkably influential on later authors of fantasy fiction. James Blish was a fan of Cabell's works, and for a time edited Kalki, the journal of the Cabell Society. Robert A. Heinlein was greatly inspired by Cabell's boldness, and originally described his book Stranger in a Strange Land as \"a Cabellesque satire\". A later work, Job: A Comedy of Justice, derived its title from Jurgen and contains appearances by Jurgen and the Slavic god Koschei. Charles G. Finney's  fantasy The Circus of Dr. Lao was influenced by Cabell's work.Gary K. Wolfe, \"The Circus of Dr. Lao\" in Magill, Frank Northen. Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature, Vol 1. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. . (pp.\u00a0282\u2013286). The Averoigne stories of Clark Ashton Smith are, in background, close to those of Cabell's Poictesme. Jack Vance's Dying Earth books show considerable stylistic resemblances to Cabell; Cugel the Clever in those books bears a strong resemblance, not least in his opinion of himself, to Jurgen. Cabell was also a major influence on Neil Gaiman, acknowledged as such in the rear of Gaiman's novels Stardust and American Gods. This thematic and stylistic influence is highly evident in the multi-layered pantheons of Gaiman's work, The Sandman, which have many parallels in Cabell's work, particularly Jurgen."]}, {"page": "Jabberwocky", "response": ["*  read by English author Neil Gaiman"]}, {"page": "Lord Dunsany", "response": ["*Neil Gaiman expressed admiration for Dunsany and wrote an introduction to a collection of his stories.
