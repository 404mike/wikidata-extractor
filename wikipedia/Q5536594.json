Now partnered by Tom Holford and George Baddeley this new half-back line helped keep Stoke in the First Division for five more years. The press described Bradley as 'a model of consistency' but he was also a skilful player who became one of the first to use tricks. He would swing hard at the ball with his right foot and dummy the player facing him by kicking the ball with the outside of his left. Despite the quality of their midfield, year after year Stoke narrowly clung on to their top-flight status. Improvements to the Victoria Ground in 1903 cost \u00a32,000 swallowing the club's already dwindling finances and so the board agreed to sell their best players with Bradley poised to join Plymouth Argyle in 1905.

He \"did not put a foot wrong\" in his first seasons at the club, before establishing himself as the centre of Stoke's half-back line between James Bradley and George Baddeley following Alf Wood's departure in March 1901. For the next ten seasons Holford was a near ever-present in the Stoke team, racking up 105 consecutive appearances from March 1903 to March 1906. His good performances won him an England cap in 1903 and he is considered the smallest centre-back ever to play for England at just 5\u00a0ft 5. During Holford's time at the club he played the game in a fiery style, although he was never sent off. He succeeded George Baddeley as captain in 1905. Holford's manager Horace Austerberry described him as \"an excellent passer of the ball and one who played every match as if it was his last\". In 1908 Stoke went bust and dropped out of the English Football League and played in the Birmingham League. Holford was too good to be lost to non-league football and so he had to leave his home-town club, who he played nearly 270 games for.Matthews, Tony: \"The Encyclopedia of Stoke City \" (Lion Press, 1994, )"]}, {"page": "List of West Bromwich Albion F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Oldest first-team player: George Baddeley, 39 years 345 days, vs Sheffield Wednesday, First Division, 18 April 1914"]}, {"page": "Harry Croxton", "response": ["He played eighteen times for the \"Potters\" in 1905\u201306, hitting the net in a 4\u20130 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Victoria Ground.

This trio played together 74 times for Stoke at senior level and became a formidable midfield three.
