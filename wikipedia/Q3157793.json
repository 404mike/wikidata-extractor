It is further maintained that gender leads to a social system that is dominated by males, which in turn influences the individual psycho-sexual development.

Other critics (for instance, Peter Hunt (1991), Perry Nodelman (1992), John Stephens (1992), and Roderick McGillis (1996)) take this idea a step further and argue that children are often \"colonized\" by adults, including children's literature critics, because adults speak on behalf of children instead of letting children express themselves. However, these critics too can not agree on what then are \"true\" children expressing themselves, and which books are therefore \"good\" for them. Finally, a few critics, notably Jacqueline Rose (1984) and Karin Lesnik-Oberstein (1994 and 2004) take this discussion even further, arguing that identities are created and not \"inherent\", and that in the case of an identity such as \"childhood\" it is created by \"adults\" in the light of their own perceptions of themselves. That is, \"adulthood\" defines \"childhood\" in relation to differences and similarities it perceives to itself.
