The manor of Carlton was acquired by Nicholas Stapleton (1280\u20131343), eldest son of Miles de Stapleton (d.1314), killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, who was Steward of the Household to King Edward II. The family originated at the manor of Stapleton-on-Tees near Darlingtonhttps://carltontowers.co.uk/home/the-family  in North Yorkshire. Carlton passed to Nicholas's nephew Sir Bryan Stapleton (c.1321\u20131394), a Knight of the Garter and Warden of Calais, younger brother and heir of Sir Miles Stapleton (c.1320\u20131372), of Bedale, Yorkshire, a founder Knight of the Garter. The last in the male line of Stapleton of Carlton was Sir Miles Stapleton, 1st Baronet (1628\u20131707) who died childless and left his estates to his nephew Nicholas Errington (d.1716) of Ponteland, Northumberland, who in accordance with the bequest adopted the name and arms of Stapleton. Nicholas's grandson, Thomas Stapleton (d.1821), succeeded in 1750 and in 1765 improved the house and estate, commissioning Thomas White to landscape the park and Thomas Atkinson of York to add the long East Wing, the clock above which shows the date 1777.https://carltontowers.co.uk/home/history/  Thomas was a keen breeder and trainer of horses and with Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th Baronet won the St. Leger Stakes in 1778 with Hollandaise and in his own right the following year with Tommy. In 1795 he made an unsuccessful claim to the title Baron Beaumont, abeyant since 1507, which he was in remainder to through his great-grandmother Mrs Anne Errington, sister of Sir Miles Stapleton, 1st Baronet, both descendants via a distant female line of John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont, 6th Baron Beaumont (d.1460), himself a descendant in the male line of John de Brienne (d.1237), King of Jerusalem, by his third wife, Berengaria of Leon, and thus a second cousin of King Edward II of England. His son Miles died without issue in 1707, when the estate passed to his first-cousin Thomas Stapleton (d.1839), whose son Miles Stapleton, 8th Baron Beaumont (1805\u20131854) in 1840 successfully obtained the abeyant title Baron Beaumont. The house was re-built to its present form in 1873-5 by his son Henry Stapleton, 9th Baron Beaumont (1848\u20131892), an officer in the British Army, who married Violet Marie Louise Wootton Isaacson, daughter of Frederick Wootton Isaacson. As he had no children his heir was his younger brother Miles Stapleton, 10th Baron Beaumont (1850\u20131895), an officer in the British Army, who married Mary Ethel Tempest, daughter and heiress of Sir Charles Henry Tempest, 1st Baronet (1834\u20131894) of Heaton,\"a township, in the parish of Deane, union of Bolton, hundred of Salford, S. division of Lancashire, 2\u00bd miles (W. by N.) from Bolton...The property belongs exclusively to H.
