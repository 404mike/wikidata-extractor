Tytler became the first person in Britain to fly by ascending in a hot air balloon (1784).\nA group of historiographers wrote about him:\n\nA social outcast, Tytler did much hack work for low pay and rarely if ever emerged from poverty. But ... he deserves to be remembered as a man of many talents \u2013 as a political and religious controversialist, scholar, journalist, poet, song writer, musician, balloonist, pharmacist, surgeon and printer. In addition ... he was an outstanding encyclopedist whose editorship of the second edition earns him a notable place in the history of encyclopedias.", "link_mentions": {}}}
