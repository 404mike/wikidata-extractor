Wedgwood is also noted as an early adopter/founder of managerial accounting principles in Anthony Hopwood's \"Archaeology of Accounting Systems.\" Historian Tristram Hunt called Wedgwood a \"difficult, brilliant, creative entrepreneur whose personal drive and extraordinary gifts changed the way we work and live.\""]}, {"page": "Friedrich Engels", "response": ["Later in their life, both Marx and Engels came to argue that in some countries workers might be able to achieve their aims through peaceful means.Gray, Daniel; Johnson, Elliott; Walker, David (2014). Historical Dictionary of Marxism. Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements (2nd ed.). Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield. pp. 119\u2013120. . In following this, Engels argued that socialists were evolutionists, although they remained committed to social revolution.Steger, Manfred B. (1999). \"Friedrich Engels and the Origins of German Revisionism: Another Look\". In Carver, Terrell; Steger, Manfred B. (eds.). Engels After Marx. University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University. pp. 181\u2013196. . Similarly, Tristram Hunt argues that Engels was sceptical of \"top-down revolutions\" and later in life advocated \"a peaceful, democratic road to socialism\". Engels also wrote in his introduction to the 1891 edition of Marx's The Class Struggles in France that \"[r]ebellion in the old style, street fighting with barricades, which decided the issue everywhere up to 1848, was to a considerable extent obsolete\",Kellogg, Paul (Summer 1991). \"Engels and the Roots of 'Revisionism': A Re-Evaluation\".

New York: Simon & Schuster. p. 7. . although some such as David W. Lowell empashised their cautionary and tactical meaning, arguing that \"Engels questions only rebellion 'in the old style', that is, insurrection: he does not renounce revolution. The reason for Engels' caution is clear: he candidly admits that ultimate victory for any insurrection is rare, simply on military and tactical grounds\".Lowell, David W. (1984).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 83. .", "Historian and former Labour MP Tristram Hunt, author of The Frock-Coated Communist: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels, argues that Engels \"almost certainly was, in other words, the kind of man Stalin would have had shot\". Hunt sums up the disconnect between Engels's personality and the Soviet Union which later utilised his works, stating:", "Tristram Hunt argues that Engels has become a convenient scapegoat, too easily blamed for the state crimes of Communist regimes such as China, the Soviet Union and those in Africa and Southeast Asia, among others. Hunt writes that \"Engels is left holding the bag of 20th century ideological extremism\" while Karl Marx \"is rebranded as the acceptable, post\u2013political seer of global capitalism\". Hunt largely exonerates Engels, stating that \"[i]n no intelligible sense can Engels or Marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later, even if the policies were offered up in their honor\". Andrew Lipow describes Marx and Engels as \"the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism\".Lipow, Arthur (1991). Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement. University of California Press. p. 1. . \"We are not among those communists who are out to destroy personal liberty, who wish to turn the world into one huge barrack or into a gigantic workhouse. There certainly are some communists who, with an easy conscience, refuse to countenance personal liberty and would like to shuffle it out of the world because they consider that it is a hindrance to complete harmony. But we have no desire to exchange freedom for equality. We are convinced that in no social order will freedom be assured as in a society based upon communal ownership. Thus wrote the editors of the Journal of the Communist League in 1847, under the direct influence of the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.\"", "* The Brave New World: Tristram Hunt On Marx and Engels' Revolutionary Vision"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Tristram Hunt (born 1974)"]}, {"page": "General Certificate of Secondary Education", "response": ["Both modular and linear assessment have been politically contentious, and the opposition Labour Party UK, and particularly the former MP Tristram Hunt stated that it was their policy that such reforms be halted and reversed, maintaining modular assessment in both GCSEs and A-Levels.
