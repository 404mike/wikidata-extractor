Ena jumped at the chance to go abroad for the first time and meet the family she never knew she had. Upon her return, Ena was horrified to see the Mission converted into a Community Centre, with social worker Ruth Winter (Colette O'Neil) employed there full-time. She quit upon hearing the news and moved in with Minnie at No.5. Despite being out of work, Ena was soon occupied with other problems as Vera came to stay, having separated from her husband Bob Lomax. Vera had debts to pay but not the money to pay them, so Ena gave her the money \u2013 even though it was all her savings. A disoriented Ena was later caught accidentally stealing from a supermarket. In court Ena pleaded not guilty, but refused to give her age when questioned, saying only that she was over 21. She was subsequently fined 40/-. To offset her money problems Ena took on the job of live-in housekeeper at No.9 for Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) although, when the Community Centre at the Mission closed down, Ena moved back into the vestry."]}, {"page": "Bad Girls (TV series)", "response": ["* Colette O'Neil as Sister Thomas (Series 7)"]}, {"page": "Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed", "response": ["* Colette O'Neil as Madwoman"]}, {"page": "Snakedance", "response": ["In Doctor Who: The Episode Guide, Mark Campbell awarded it seven out of ten, describing it as \"less experimental than Kinda\" but still containing \"some good moments\", although he concluded that \"Martin Clunes and Colette O'Neill are the best things in it\".

The actress went on with the rest of the performance and was seen to at the end by a doctor who had been in the audience and later taken to hospital. John Martin (co-founder of the Traverse and an early chairman of the board) says that the real knife was used because the space was so small and the audience sat so close to the stage a fake knife would have been detected.  Richard Demarco says it was because they had no money and could not afford a paper one.
