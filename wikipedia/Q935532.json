Although Singer compared Laurie's audition tape to an \"Osama bin Laden video\", he was impressed with Laurie's acting and, not knowing who he was, Singer was fooled by his American accent. He commented on how well the \"American actor\" was able to grasp the character, not knowing about Laurie's British nationality. Although Laurie's appearance was very different from the way Shore pictured House, when he watched the audition tape, he was equally impressed as Singer. More famous (in the American market) actors such as Denis Leary, Rob Morrow and Patrick Dempsey were also considered, but Singer, Shore, and executive producers Paul Attanasio and Katie Jacobs all thought Laurie was the best option and decided to cast him for the part.Challen, p. 39 Laurie was the final actor to join the cast of House. After he was chosen for the part, Laurie, whose father Ran Laurie was a doctor himself, said he felt guilty for \"being paid more to become a fake version of my own father\". While Laurie has used an American accent before in the Stuart Little films, he found it difficult to adopt for his role, saying that words such as \"coronary artery\" are particularly tricky to pronounce."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Ran LaurieJack Wilson"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1936 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Ran Laurie"]}, {"page": "St Faith's School", "response": ["*Ran Laurie (1915\u201318), winner of gold medal for the coxless pairs in the 1948 Olympics; father of actor Hugh Laurie"]}, {"page": "Alexander McCulloch", "response": ["In later life McCulloch was one of the coaches of Jack Wilson and Ran Laurie.Private communication, the McCulloch family 22 February 2010."]}]}}
