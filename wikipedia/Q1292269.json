He held the position of Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, where he tutored Arthur Evans; later he and Evans would be activists in the Balkan uprising of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1874\u20131878) against the Ottoman Empire. After the marriage of his daughter Margaret to Evans, he and Evans collaborated on the fourth volume of his History of Sicily. He was a prolific writer, publishing 239 distinct works. One of his best known is his magnum opus, The History of the Norman Conquest of England (published in 6 volumes, 1867\u20131879). Both he and Margaret died before Evans purchased the land from which he would excavate the Palace of Knossos.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ivanhoe", "response": ["There has been criticism of Scott's portrayal of the bitter extent of the \"enmity of Saxon and Norman, represented as persisting in the days of Richard\" as \"unsupported by the evidence of contemporary records that forms the basis of the story.\"\"Ivanhoe\", page 499. The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 1989 Historian E. A.

Oxford, Clarendon Press,  1876. (pp. 825-6). Freeman also cited the late twelfth-century book Dialogus de Scaccario by Richard FitzNeal. This book claimed that the Saxons and Normans had so merged through intermarriage and cultural assimilation that (outside the aristocracy) it was impossible to tell \"one from the other.\" Finally, Freeman ended his critique of Scott by saying that by the end of the twelfth century, the descendants of both Saxons and Normans in England referred to themselves as \"English\", not \"Saxon\" or \"Norman\"."]}, {"page": "Anjou", "response": ["* Edward Augustus Freeman, The History of the Norman Conquest of England, its Causes and its Results (2d vol.)"]}, {"page": "Arthur Evans", "response": ["He had convinced one of his examiners, Edward Augustus Freeman, of his talent.

Freeman convinced Evans's tutors, George Kitchen and John Richard Green, and they convinced the Regius professor, William Stubbs, that, in view of his special other knowledge and interests, and his father's \"high standing in learned society,\" Evans should not only be passed, but receive a first-class degree.
