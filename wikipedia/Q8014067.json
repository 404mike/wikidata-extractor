A celebrity chef, he was a household name during the 19th century, and his 1817 cookbook, The Cook's Oracle, was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and the United States. The origin of the crisp (also known as potato chip) is attributed to Kitchiner, with The Cook's Oracle including the earliest known recipe.Unlike most food writers of the time he cooked the food himself, washed up afterwards, and performed all the household tasks he wrote about. He travelled around with his portable cabinet of taste, a folding cabinet containing his mustards and sauces. He was also the creator of Wow-Wow sauce.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bubble and squeak", "response": ["The dish as it is made in modern times differs considerably from its first recorded versions, in which cooked beef was the main ingredient and potatoes did not feature.

An 1825 British book about French cookery calls them \"Pommes de Terre frites\" (second recipe) and calls for thin slices of potato fried in \"clarified butter or goose dripping\", drained and sprinkled with salt.

In 1920, Frank Smith of The Smiths Potato Crisps Company Ltd packaged a twist of salt with his crisps in greaseproof paper bags, which were sold around London. Crisps remained otherwise unseasoned until an important scientific development in the 1950s. After Archer Martin and Richard Synge (while working in Leeds) received a Nobel Prize for the invention of partition chromatography in 1952, food scientists began to develop flavours via a gas chromatograph, a device that allowed scientists to understand chemical compounds behind complex flavours such as cheese. In 1954, Irish crisps company Tayto produced the first seasoned crisps: Cheese & Onion and Salt & Vinegar. The crisp market in the UK is led by Walkers (who introduced their own flavours in 1954), holding 56% of the market share."]}, {"page": "Wow-Wow sauce", "response": ["Wow-Wow Sauce (sometimes referred to as Bow wow sauce) is a sauce for which the first known recipe was published by William Kitchiner of London in 1817. #328, Wow Wow Sauce, for Bouilli Beef.
