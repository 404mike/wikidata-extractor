Schwebel was born on March 10, 1929 in New York City and while attending high school in New York City developed a strong interest in the United Nations Conference on International Organization being held in San Francisco.  The U.N. Conference and the U.N. student organization that he was active in (and that was later affiliated with the United Nations Association of the United States of America), marked the start of a long focus on international relations and law. After entering Harvard University, he became active in the U.N. student movement and participated in founding The United Nations Council of Harvard. In 1950 he received a B.A. magna cum laude with highest honors in government from Harvard and was awarded the Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship. The Knox Fellowship enabled Schwebel to perform research and study in a Commonwealth country of his choice. Schwebel chose to study international law at Cambridge University in England under Sir Hersch Lauterpacht who advised him, upon completion of his year at Cambridge, to attend law school. He subsequently entered Yale Law School where he received an LL.B. (1954). While studying at Yale, Schwebel was told by the eminent professor of law Myres McDougal that in order to become an influential international lawyer he first needed to, \"earn his spurs,\" at the best law firm that would take him.Kreisler, Harry  Reflections on a Career in International Law: Conversation with Judge Stephen M. Schwebel of the ICJ. January 22, 1990, Institute of International Studies, University of California - Berkeley. Accessed 3 March 2015.

While at White & Case, he had the opportunity to participate in one of the largest international arbitration cases of the 20th century -  Saudi Arabia v. Arabian American Oil Company.   Schwebel was assigned the, \"digging,\" on the case and spent countless hours going through files; however, the experience engendered a lifelong interest in international arbitration. In 1959, he accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School where he taught until 1961.
