The author of many books on Leonardo, Kemp has also written about visualisation in art and science, particularly anatomy, natural sciences and optics. Instrumental in the controversial authentication of Salvator Mundi to Leonardo, Kemp has been vocal on attributions to Leonardo, including support of La Bella Principessa and opposition of the Isleworth Mona Lisa.\nSince 2008, he has been emeritus professor of art history at the University of Oxford, prior to which he was a professor of Art History there (1995\u20132008) and held posts at University of St Andrews (1981\u20131995) and University of Glasgow (1966\u20131981).

He was born out of wedlock to  (Ser Piero di Antonio di Ser Piero di Ser Guido da Vinci; 1426\u20131504), a Florentine legal notary, and  ( \u2013 1494), from the lower-class. It remains uncertain where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele Repetti, is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had. Leonardo's parents both married separately the year after his birth. Caterina\u2014who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only \"Caterina\" or \"Catelina\"\u2014is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed \"L'Accattabriga\" (\"the quarrelsome one\"). Other theories have been proposed, particularly that of art historian Martin Kemp, who suggested Caterina di Meo Lippi, an orphan that married purportedly with aid from Ser Piero and his family. Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori\u2014having been betrothed to her the previous year\u2014and after her death in 1462, went on to have three subsequent marriages.  From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 12 half-siblings who were much younger than he was (the last was born when Leonardo was 40 years old) and with whom he had very little contact.", "* Universal Leonardo, a database of Leonardo's life and works maintained by Martin Kemp and Marina Wallace"]}, {"page": "Mona Lisa", "response": ["Of Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, and one of four works \u2013 the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi and The Last Supper \u2013 whose attribution has avoided controversy. He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model of the Mona Lisa, by October 1503. It is believed by some that the Mona Lisa was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence. Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty. Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513. According to Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\". In 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Francis I to work at the Clos Luc\u00e9 near the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise; it is believed that he took the Mona Lisa with him and continued to work on it after he moved to France. Art historian Carmen C. Bambach has concluded that Leonardo probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517.Leonardo, Carmen Bambach, Rachel Stern, and Alison Manges (2003).

In line with this theory, it is hypothesised that the Louvre painting was sold in the late 1480s, after some haggling over the final payment. The London painting was commenced in perhaps 1486 as a substitution for the \"original\" Louvre version, and was not ready for installation until 1508, after prolonged disagreement and negotiation. This explanation, which della Chiesa attributes to Venturi and Poggi,Angela Ottino della Chiesa, p. 95 has gained wide acceptance, and is the version of events described on both the National Gallery and the Louvre websites.National Gallery, Virgin of the RocksZ\u00f6llner F, Leonardo da Vinci, Taschen, (2003) p. 223 Martin Kemp dates the Louvre painting to 1483\u20131490 and the London painting to 1495\u20131508.Kemp, pp. 250\u2013251"]}, {"page": "Lady with an Ermine", "response": ["Though there are a few areas of minor damage, art historian Frank Z\u00f6llner insists the work is in \"very good condition... similar to the equally well preserved Mona Lisa\". Such evaluation is relatively recent, however, as the work was previously considered to be considerably damaged and repainted. Promotion of such analysis largely began with the art historian Kenneth Clark, who asserted in 1961 that the entire left side of the figure, as well as the background had been repainted. Scholars such as Adolfo Venturi, Angela Ottino della Chiesa and Jack Wasserman advanced the idea; however, 1992 technical analysis at the National Gallery of Art led by David Bull has confirmed that the damaged was limited to the background. Specifically, the background was likely originally a bluish-grey, overpainted with black during the mid 18th century. The signature LEONARD D'AWINCI in the top left corner was probably also added at this time. There is also slight overpainting in the mouth and nose; some art historians suggest Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix was responsible for the overpaint in the background and elsewhere. The background was also subject to the misconception that it originally included a window. It was proposed by , who led 1955 X-ray testing at Warsaw Laboratories, and explained certain spots in the right background as being remnants of a window. Such a conclusion has been disproven by Bull, Pietro C. Marani and others. In light of this revision\u2014with the primary damage being overpaint in the background\u2014the art historian Martin Kemp noted that \"the picture is in much better condition than the standard accounts suggest, and gives the clearest indication of the freshly brilliant quality of Leonardo's painting during his period at the Sforza court in Milan\"."]}, {"page": "Madonna Litta", "response": ["That the painting was regarded in Leonardo's lifetime as his work is suggested by the large number of copies made of it. A popular candidate for authorship is Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio. David Alan Brown argues that Marco d'Oggiono was responsible for the Madonna Litta as its composition is reflected in his later works, whereas it is not in those of Boltraffio.

Due to the poor condition of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible. This has not stopped some scholars from hypothesizing what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity. The partially erased letters can be made out as \"Cant\" and \"An\" and are usually read as \"\", Latin for 'angelic song', although the art historian Martin Kemp notes that it could be \"\", Italian for 'angelic singer'. The notes have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting that the subject is a musician. They are in mensural notation and therefore probably show polyphonic music. Leonardo's surviving drawings of rebuses with musical notation in the Print Room of Windsor Castle do not resemble the music in the painting. This suggests that this musical composition is not by Leonardo, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music unknown."]}, {"page": "The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist", "response": ["A date of 1498\u201399 is put on the work by Padre Sebastiano Resta who wrote to Giovanni Pietro Bellori saying that Leonardo had drawn the cartoon in Milan at the request of Louis XII of France.

The rocky outcrop in the foreground of the Buccleuch Madonna is painted with a minute attention to geological detail. A major difference between the Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas is in their background landscapes. Whereas the background of the Buccleuch version is a watery landscape indifferently painted, that of the Lansdowne Madonna has a dramatic mountain range far more typical of Leonardo. It has been proposed that this is a specific location in the valley of the river Adda, as it runs from Lecco to Vaprio, an area familiar to Leonardo and which he mapped. It is possible that the landscape of the former picture was added by a pupil after Leonardo failed to complete the work.

A number of Italian experts in the 1920s echoed Konody's assessment of authorship by Leonardo at a time when the painting was more broadly examined.
