Mantell was a right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper.  He was born at Acton, Middlesex.\nMantell made his first-class debut for Sussex against Cambridge University in 1954.  He made 25 further first-class appearances for the county, the last of which came against Essex in the 1958 County Championship.  In his 26 first-class matches for Sussex, he scored a total of 150 runs at an average of 6.00, with a high score of 34.  Behind the stumps he took 28 catches and made 2 stumpings.  Mantell found his opportunities limited, and when the regular Sussex wicketkeeper Rupert Webb announced he would retire from full-time cricket at the end of the 1958 season, Sussex encouraged Jim Parks, a far better batsman than Mantell, to take up wicketkeeping; that led Mantell to leave the county at the end of the 1958 season.\nHe died on 26 January 2017 at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mantell", "response": ["*David Mantell (1934\u20142017), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2017", "response": ["*David Mantell, 82, English cricketer (Sussex).David Mantell : Obituary"]}, {"page": "List of people named David", "response": ["*David Mantell (1934\u20132017), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Mantell, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Mantell"]}]}}
