Aurelian's military campaigns included the conquest of the Gallic Empire. N. J. Higham suggests that Ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late Roman Empire, such as the Theodosian dynasty.

The Annals of the Four Masters report the deaths of Abbots of Lismore, but nothing of D\u00e1l Riata except reports of the death of \u00c1ed, s.a. 771, and of his brother Fergus, s.a. 778. The Annals of Ulster say that a certain Donncoirche, \"king of D\u00e1l Riata\" died in 792, and there the record ends. Any number of theories have been advanced to fill the missing generations, none of which are founded on any very solid evidence.See the discussion in Broun, \"Pictish Kings\", where another theory is advanced. A number of kings are named in the Duan Albanach, and in royal genealogies, but these are rather less reliable than we might wish. The obvious conclusion is that whoever ruled the petty kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata after its defeat and conquest in the 730s, only \u00c1ed Find and his brother Fergus drew the least attention of the chroniclers in Iona and Ireland.

Alex Woolf concurs and Pauline Stafford describes \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as \"the last Mercian queen\", referred to in charters in such terms as \"by the gift of Christ's mercy ruling the government of the Mercians\". Stafford argues that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d exercised most or all of the powers of a monarch after Alfred's death but it would have been a provocative act formally to claim regality, especially after \u00c6thelwold's rebellion.

While Anlaf (Middle Irish: Amla\u00edb, Old Norse: \u00d3l\u00e1fr) is a common Scandinavian and Norse-Gaelic name, Maccus, a Norse-Gaelic name of Middle Irish origin, is geographically more restricted and is particularly well attested in southern Scottish place-names.David E.
