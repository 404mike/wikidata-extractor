Kirkus, which gave the book a starred review and nominated it for the Kirkus Prize, called it, \"Powerful, captivating, and raw.\" Charisse Jones of USA Today praised the novel, giving it four out of four stars: \"While Tomi Adeyemi's Africa-inspired fantasy was written for young adults, readers of all ages will be captivated by this engrossing tale\". David Canfield of Entertainment Weekly called the novel a \"phenomenon\" owing to the success of a first-time author. Author and poet Kiran Millwood Hargrave in The Guardian praised, \"the hate-to-love romance [that] comes with high stakes, and the relationship is realistically and passionately realised. All of it is packaged in a tightly plotted, action-packed adventure.\" Less positively, The A.V. Club said the book failed to live up to its hype, criticising the way magic works in the novel and its length."]}, {"page": "Jhalak Prize", "response": ["* Kiran Millwood Hargrave, The Girl Of Ink And Stars (Chicken House)"]}]}}
