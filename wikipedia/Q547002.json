Whether Handel remained there, and if he did for how long, is unknown, but many biographers suggest that he was withdrawn from school by his father, based on the characterization of him by Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring. Mainwaring is the source for almost all information (little as it is) of Handel's childhood, and much of that information came from J.C. Smith, Jr., Handel's confidant and copyist.; . Whether it came from Smith or elsewhere, Mainwaring frequently relates misinformation. It is from Mainwaring that the portrait comes of Handel's father as implacably opposed to any musical education. Mainwaring writes that Georg H\u00e4ndel was \"alarmed\" at Handel's very early propensity for music, \"took every measure to oppose it\", including forbidding any musical instrument in the house and preventing Handel from going to any house where they might be found. This did nothing to dampen young Handel's inclination; in fact, it did the reverse. Mainwaring tells the story of Handel's secret attic spinet: Handel \"found means to get a little clavichord privately convey'd to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep\". Although both John Hawkins and Charles Burney credited this tale, Schoelcher found it nearly \"incredible\" and a feat of \"poetic imagination\" and Lang considers it one of the unproven \"romantic stories\" that surrounded Handel's childhood.

Charles Burney reviewed the first concert thus: \"Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England.\" Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with Rebecca Schroeter."]}, {"page": "Opera", "response": ["Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to Thomas Arne, both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being Thomas and Sally in 1760. His opera Artaxerxes (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, Love in a Village (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. Charles Burney wrote that Arne introduced \"a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated\"."]}, {"page": "Age of Enlightenment", "response": ["The desire to explore, record and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact on music publications.

Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of \u00a340, in February 1758.

The Burney children found their new stepmother overbearing and quick to anger, and they took refuge by making fun of her behind her back.

His second son was the Rev. Charles Burney, a major donor of books to the British Museum, and his second daughter was Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay. Her published diary and letters contain many minute and interesting particulars of her father's public and private life, and of his friends and contemporaries, including his initial opposition to her marriage to the French refugee Alexandre D'Arblay in 1793 and to her sister Charlotte's remarriage to the pamphleteer and stock jobber Ralph Broome in 1798.The Journals and Letters..., Vol. IV, West Humble 1797\u20131801, pp. 116\u201325 ff. A life of Burney was compiled by Madame D'Arblay and appeared in 1832, but it has been criticized consistently for being eulogistic.\"It is an account distorted by frequent inaccuracy and by Fanny's attempt, surely prompted by an over-zealous sense of duty, to paint her father in the best possible light. Almost from the moment of publication, the Memoirs of Doctor Burney was dismissed as a factual account, notably by John Wilson Croker in the Quarterly Review of 1833 (pp. 97\u2013125).\" John Wagstaff's ODNB entry for Charles Burney. Another review appeared in The Harmonicon (London: Longman etc., 1832), Vol. 10, p. 216. His daughter by his second marriage, Sarah Burney, was likewise a novelist. Her letters provide interesting, less adulatory information about her father. Although Sarah looked after him in his old age, their personal relations remained poor.Lorna J.

Charles Burney took Geminiani to task for irregular melodic structure. Hawkins, on the other hand, was of the opinion that Geminiani's approach represented an important advance in composition. \"That we are at this time in a state of emancipation from the bondage of laws imposed without authority, is owing to a new investigation of the principles of harmony, and the studies of a class of musicians, of whom Geminiani seems to have been the chief.... It is observable upon the works of Geminiani, that his modulations are not only original, but that his harmonies consist of such combinations as were never introduced into music till his time. The rules of transition from one key to another, which are laid down by those who have written on the composition of music, he not only disregarded, but objected to as an unnecessary restraint on the powers of invention. He has been frequently heard to say, that the cadences in the fifth, the third, and the sixth of the key which occur in the works of Corelli, were rendered too familiar to the ear by the frequent repetition of them. And it seems to have been the study of his life, by a liberal use of the semitonic intervals, to increase the number of harmonic combinations; and into melody to introduce a greater variety than it was otherwise capable of.\""]}, {"page": "1772 in literature", "response": ["**Charles Burney tours Europe, researching for his History of Music."]}, {"page": "1776 in literature", "response": ["*Charles Burney \u2013 A General History of Music (completed 1789)"]}]}}
