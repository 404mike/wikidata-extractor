(1997), p. 1 and \"The bar was our altar.\"Thomas, C. (1997), p. 9 Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs.Lycett (2003) In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic.. Tremlett argues that many of Thomas's health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes."]}, {"page": "Muammar Gaddafi", "response": ["Like other contemporary nomadic Bedouin tribes, the family were illiterate and did not keep any birth records. Many biographers have used 7 June; however, his birthday is not known with certainty and sources have set it in 1942 or the spring of 1943, although his biographers David Blundy and Andrew Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940. Gaddafi had three older sisters and is the only son of his parents. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life; he preferred the desert over the city and would retreat there to meditate."]}, {"page": "Ian Fleming", "response": ["In May 1939 Fleming was recruited by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence of the Royal Navy, to become his personal assistant. He joined the organisation full-time in August 1939, with the codename \"17F\", and worked out of Room 39 at the Admiralty, now known as the Ripley Building. Fleming's biographer, Andrew Lycett, notes that Fleming had \"no obvious qualifications\" for the role. As part of his appointment, Fleming was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in July 1939, initially as lieutenant, but was promoted to lieutenant-commander a few months later."]}, {"page": "From Russia, with Love (novel)", "response": ["As with several of his works, Fleming appropriated the names or backgrounds of people he knew or had heard of for the story's characters: Red Grant, a Jamaican river guide\u2014whom Fleming's biographer Andrew Lycett described as \"a cheerful, voluble giant of villainous aspect\"\u2014was used for the half-German, half-Irish assassin. Rosa Klebb was partly based on Colonel Rybkina, a real-life member of the Lenin Military-Political Academy about whom Fleming had written an article for The Sunday Times. The Spektor machine used as the bait for Bond was not a Cold War device, but had its roots in the Second World War Enigma machine, which Fleming had tried to obtain while serving in the Naval Intelligence Division."]}, {"page": "SPECTRE", "response": ["In Ian Fleming's novels, SPECTRE is a commercial enterprise led by Blofeld. The top level of the organisation is made up of twenty-one individuals, eighteen of whom handle day-to-day affairs. Members are drawn in groups of three from six of the world's most notorious organisations\u2014the Nazi German Gestapo, the Soviet SMERSH, Yugoslav Marshal Josip Broz Tito's OZNA, the Italian Mafia, the French-Corsican Unione Corse, and KRYSTAL, a massive Turkish heroin-smuggling operation; coincidentally, the three from Krystal are all formerly of RAHIR, an intelligence agency previously run by Blofeld.Thunderball, Ian Fleming, Page 63, 1961, London: Johnathon Cape The remaining three members are Blofeld himself and two scientific/technical experts. Their d\u00e9but is in the ninth Bond novel, Thunderball (1961). When Fleming was writing the novel in 1959, he believed that the Cold War might end during the two years it would take to produce the film, and came to the conclusion that the inclusion of a contemporary political villain would leave the film looking dated; he therefore thought it better to create a politically neutral enemy for Bond.Ian Fleming, Andrew Lycett, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1995. Fleming's SPECTRE has elements inspired by mafia syndicates and organised crime rings that were actively hunted by law enforcement in the 1950s. The strict codes of loyalty and silence, and the hard retributions that followed violations, were hallmarks of American gangster rings, the Italian Mafia, the Unione Corse, the Chinese Tongs and Triads, and the Japanese Yakuza and Black Dragon Society. During the events of Thunderball, SPECTRE successfully hijacked two nuclear warheads for ransom."]}, {"page": "Moonraker (novel)", "response": ["Fleming undertook a significant amount of background research in preparation for writing Moonraker; he asked his fellow correspondent on The Sunday Times, Anthony Terry, for information on the Second World War German resistance force\u2014the Werewolves\u2014and German V-2 rockets. The latter was a subject on which he wrote to the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and the British Interplanetary Society. Fleming also visited the Wimpole Street psychiatrist Eric Strauss to discuss the traits of megalomaniacs; Strauss lent him the book Men of Genius, which provided the link between megalomania and childhood thumb-sucking. Fleming used this information to give Drax diastema, a common result of thumb-sucking. According to his biographer Andrew Lycett, Fleming \"wanted to make Moonraker his most ambitious and personal novel yet.\" Fleming, a keen card player, was fascinated by the background to the 1890 royal baccarat scandal, and when in 1953 he met a woman who had been present at the game, he questioned her so intently that she burst into tears."]}, {"page": "Adrian Conan Doyle", "response": ["Adrian has been depicted as a racing car driver, big-game hunter, explorer, and writer. Biographer Andrew Lycett calls him a \"spendthrift playboy\" who (with his brother Denis) \"used the Conan Doyle estate as a milch-cow\".Lycett, p. 464."]}, {"page": "Thunderball (novel)", "response": ["When the script was first drafted in May 1959, with the storyline of an aeroplane of celebrities in the Atlantic, it included elements from Fleming's friend Ernie Cuneo, who included ships with underwater trapdoors in their hulls and an underwater battle scene. The Russians were originally the villains, then the Sicilian Mafia, but this was later changed again to the internationally operating criminal organisation, SPECTRE. Both McClory and Fleming claim to have come up with the concept of SPECTRE; Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett and John Cork both note Fleming as the originator of the group, Lycett saying that \"[Fleming] proposed that Bond should confront not the Russians but SPECTRE\u00a0...\" while Cork produced a memorandum in which Fleming called for the change to SPECTRE:"]}, {"page": "Stamford, Lincolnshire", "response": ["*Andrew Lycett (born 1948), biographer"]}, {"page": "Sidney Reilly", "response": ["In Ian Fleming, The Man Behind James Bond by Andrew Lycett, Sidney Reilly is listed as an inspiration for James Bond. Reilly's friend, former diplomat and journalist Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, was a close acquaintance of Ian Fleming for many years and recounted to Fleming many of Reilly's espionage adventures. Lockhart had worked with Reilly in Russia in 1918, where they became embroiled in an SIS-backed plot to overthrow Lenin's Bolshevik government."]}, {"page": "The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)", "response": ["The Spy Who Loved Me was written in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1961 and was the shortest manuscript Fleming had produced for a novel, being only 113 pages long. Fleming found the book the easiest for him to write and apologised to his editor at Jonathan Cape for the ease. The Spy Who Loved Me has been described by Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett as Fleming's \"most sleazy and violent story ever\", which may have been indicative of his state of mind at the time."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Andrew Lycett"]}, {"page": "For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)", "response": ["In the summer of 1958, CBS television commissioned Fleming to write episodes of a television show based on the James Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale as an episode of the CBS television series Climax!. Fleming agreed to the deal, and began to write outlines for the series; however, CBS later dropped the idea. In January and February 1959 Fleming adapted four of these television plots into short stories at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica and added a fifth story he had written in the summer of 1958. Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that at the time Fleming was writing both the television scripts, and the short story collection, \"Ian's mood of weariness and self-doubt was beginning to affect his writing\" and this can be seen in Bond's internal monologue of thoughts."]}, {"page": "Thrilling Cities", "response": ["By the time Fleming got to New York he was fed up with travelling and his biographer, Andrew Lycett notes that \"his sour mood transferred to the city and indeed the country he had once loved\". The series opened in The Sunday Times on 24 January 1960, with an introduction from Fleming, followed by the article on Hong Kong the following week. The series finished on 28 February 1960 with the article about Chicago and New York."]}, {"page": "E. W. Hornung", "response": ["Hornung knew Doyle's sister, Constance (\"Connie\") Aim\u00e9e Monica Doyle (1868\u20131924), whom he had met when he visited Portugal. Connie was described by Doyle's biographer, Andrew Lycett, as being attractive, \"with pre-Raphaelite looks\u00a0... the most sought-after of the Doyle daughters\". By December 1892, when Hornung, Doyle and Jerome visited the Black Museum at Scotland Yard, Hornung and Connie were engaged, and in 1893 Hornung dedicated his second novel, Tiny Luttrell, \"to C.A.M.D.\" They were married on 27 September 1893, although Doyle was not at the wedding and relations between the two writers were sometimes strained. The Hornungs had a son, Arthur Oscar, in 1895; while his first name was from Doyle, who was also Arthur's godfather, the boy's middle name was probably after Doyle and Hornung's mutual friend Oscar Wilde and it was by his second name that he was known. In 1894 Doyle and Hornung began work on a play for Henry Irving, on the subject of boxing during the Regency; Doyle was initially eager and paid Hornung \u00a350 as a down payment before he withdrew after the first act had been written: the work was never completed."]}, {"page": "Inspirations for James Bond", "response": ["| During World War II Maclean was a British agent in Yugoslavia and friend (and biographer) of Josip Broz Tito, as well as a member of the Special Air Service, active in North Africa and Yugoslavia. Although a number of media sources at the time of his death suggested that he was a model for Bond, he denied the rumour, a view shared by Fleming's biographer, Andrew Lycett."]}, {"page": "The Light That Failed", "response": ["The Light That Failed was poorly received by critics in the main. Jad Adams calls the novel richly revealing even though it was badly reviewed, especially its man-loving and misogynistic undercurrents. He calls it \"... a metaphor for the failing gallantry of 19th-century man confronting the new woman.\" Andrew Lycett, in his biography of Kipling, called it a \"grown-up novel by an emotionally immature man.\" It has been variously derided as \"sentimental, unstructured, melodramatic, chauvinistic, and implausible.\" Kipling himself admitted in his autobiography that the novel was a conte (short tale of adventure) and not a built book. Lord Birkenhead calls the novel a \"rotten apple\" among Kipling's other published works."]}, {"page": "Casino Royale (novel)", "response": ["Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself, and in the novel Lynd remarks that \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" According to Andrew Lycett, Fleming's biographer, \"within the first few pages\u00a0... [Fleming] had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks\", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it \"The Vesper\", after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep champagne goblet, was for \"three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel.\""]}, {"page": "Shaken, not stirred", "response": ["Andrew Lycett, an Ian Fleming biographer, believed that Fleming liked his martinis shaken, not stirred, because Fleming thought that stirring a drink diminished its flavour.

This introduced the question of marriage, and allowed Fleming to discuss matrimony through his characters, with Bond telling Case \"Most marriages don't add two people together. They subtract one from the other.\" Lycett opines that the addition was because of the state of Fleming's own marriage which was going through a bad time."]}, {"page": "Live and Let Die (novel)", "response": ["Live and Let Die continues the theme Fleming examined in Casino Royale, that of evil or, as Fleming's biographer, Andrew Lycett, describes it, \"the banality of evil\". Fleming uses Mr Big as the vehicle to voice opinions on evil, particularly when he tells Bond that \"Mister Bond, I suffer from boredom. I am prey to what the early Christians called 'accidie', the deadly lethargy that envelops those who are sated.\" This allowed Fleming to build the Bond character as a counter to the accidie, in what the writer saw as a Manichaean struggle between good and evil. Benson considers evil as the main theme of the book, and highlights the discussion Bond has with Ren\u00e9 Mathis of the French Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau in Casino Royale, in which the Frenchman predicts Bond will seek out and kill the evil men of the world."]}, {"page": "George Cecil Ives", "response": ["He was the model for Raffles, the fictional Victorian gentleman thief, according to Andrew Lycett.The Man who created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle by Andrew Lycett pages 229\u2013230 (2007, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London & Viking, New York)  Lycett says that the creator of Raffles, E.
