He was killed in a plane crash at Sywell, Northamptonshire on 12 May 2001.\nMorgan was an engineer at Cosworth from 1970 to 1983. In 1983 he left Cosworth to form Ilmor with fellow engineer Mario Illien. Ilmor was set up with backing from Roger Penske and achieved its first race win powering Mario Andretti's Lola at the Long Beach Grand Prix. In 1989 Morgan and Illien decided to enter Formula One. \nPaul Morgan was killed instantly when his Hawker Sea Fury overturned on landing. David Coulthard won the Austrian Grand Prix the day after Morgan's death in a Mercedes-Ilmor powered McLaren. Coulthard opted not to participate in the traditional champagne celebration as a mark of respect.\nMorgan's widow reduced her shareholding of Ilmor in 2002, selling 10% to DaimlerChrysler. In 2005 DaimlerChrysler acquired all the remaining shares from Mrs. Morgan, Mario Illien and Roger Penske.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of companies named after people", "response": ["* Ilmor \u2013 Mario Illien and Paul Morgan"]}, {"page": "2001 Austrian Grand Prix", "response": ["Out of respect for Paul Morgan, the managing director of Ilmor Engineering, who was killed in a plane crash at the Sywell Aerodrome in Northampton the day before the race, Coulthard refrained from spraying champagne on the podium. In the subsequent press conference, Coulthard spoke of the importance of driving with a heavy fuel tank, \"I was able to lean the engine out early on after the first few laps and save quite a few laps of fuel as well as obviously with the safety car and that enabled us to go quite long.\" Michael Schumacher said he executed a manual start after a launch control system fault and that his strategy after the collision with Montoya was to wait until the pit stops, adding, \"I didn't have much to lose. I could have stayed behind and wait all race until the pit stops. But then I wouldn't have had a chance to have a go to get back up to the lead, which at some stage I thought I could.\" Barrichello stated he began on used front tyres and unused rear compounds and believed he would have won had Coulthard not remained on track for another three laps, \"It was one of those races where I had a good feeling, I had a good car, I was really driving as fast as I could behind him, but there was very little to take away and unfortunately I couldn't go to win again.\""]}, {"page": "Ilmor", "response": ["Ilmor is a British independent high-performance motor racing engineering company.
