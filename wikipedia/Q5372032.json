Anderson became president of Queens College Galway in 1899.She was educated privately and won the Browne Scholarship in 1909 at QCG, where she received a B.A. in 1911.She displayed a strong interest in the suffragette movement in Galway. After further study in Berlin and Marburg, she taught for two years at Queen's College, Barbados. She then returned in 1917 to Galway where she was appointed the first professor of German at University College Galway.Anderson resigned from her position in 1920. She moved to London and immediately joined the Foreign Office. In 1923 she published a translation of Benedetto Croce's book on Goethe. Between 1940 and 1943 she was seconded to the War Office; she later received the OBE for Intelligence resulting from work she carried out in the Middle East. She retired from the foreign office in 1951.Anderson published the Letters of Mozart and his family, which she herself edited and translated. Her Letters of Beethoven were published in 1961. The Federal Republic of Germany awarded her the Order Of Merit first class for her work on Beethoven.She died at Hampstead, London in October 1962. Whilst lodging with the family of Patricia Bartley, Anderson recruited her to work at the Government Code and Cypher School (the forerunner of GCHQ). It was also reported that Anderson \"made little secret of her attraction to women\".The Royal Philharmonic Society awards the Annual Emily Anderson Prize to young violinists in Anderson's honour.NUI Galway has named their concert hall the Emily Anderson Concert Hall in her memory.

As Jean-Victor Hocquard points out, the pseudo-Latin lyrics lectu mihi mars, as Peyerl would have sung them, resemble Bavarian German leck du mi im Arsch,Hocquard (1999, 203) which in a literal English rendering is \"[you] lick me in the arse\". More idiomatically, the phrase could be translated \"kiss my arse\" (American English \"kiss my ass\").For discussion of the German idiom, see Leck mich im Arsch.Hocquard's explanation presumes a dialectal pronoun mi \"me\". Copeman and Scheer (1996, 262) note that the Latin pronoun mihi was sometimes pronounced by German singers as , which would have been a good match for Standard German  mich. The second pun in the canon is based on the single Latin word jonicu. Emanuel Winternitz explains that when this word is sung repeatedly and rapidly, as in the canon, its syllables are liable to be heard as the Italian word cujoni, or in modern writing coglioni, meaning \"balls, testicles\".Winternitz (1958)The Standard Italian version of this word is \"coglioni\", the variant \"cujoni\" was maybe used around Mozart's time or is a dialect variant; thus it appears in a jokingly-worded letter from Beethoven to one of his publishers; his translator Emily Anderson explains it thus: \"Beethoven is trying to say ... \"coglioni\". The word was also uttered by Napoleon Bonaparte while rallying his troops. Sources: Emily Anderson (1985) The Letters of Beethoven, Vol. 2. Macmillan, p. 845; Oscar Browning (1907) The Fall of Napoleon. J. Lane, p. 25. Also the transformation of the word might have been slang or youth speak, in order to hide the true meaning to the non-initiated. The line thus translates as \"It is difficult to lick my arse and balls\"."]}, {"page": "Mary Josephine Donovan O'Sullivan", "response": ["* Emily Anderson"]}, {"page": "Florence Moon", "response": ["*Emily Anderson"]}, {"page": "Mary Fleetwood Berry", "response": ["* Emily Anderson"]}, {"page": "Sarah Persse", "response": ["* Emily Anderson"]}, {"page": "Anna Maria Erd\u0151dy", "response": ["Countess Anna Maria (Marie) von Erd\u0151dy (8 September 1779 \u2013 17 March 1837) was a Hungarian noblewoman and among the closest confidantes and friends of Ludwig van Beethoven.
