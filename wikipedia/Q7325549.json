London: Nicholas Brealey Publishing. .", "During the late 1990s, European defence consolidation became a prevailing practice; European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company. This ambition led to numerous reports linking various European defence groups \u2013 mainly with each other but also with American defence contractors. During July 1998, merger discussions commenced between BAe and DASA. Terms for such a merger had been reportedly agreed between British Aerospace Chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO J\u00fcrgen Schrempp in December 1998. However, when the British General Electric Company (GEC) put its defence electronics business Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAe's management opted to abandon the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival.BAE Systems Annual Report 1999 22.

The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, A\u00e9rospatiale and Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA into an integrated company; in this aim British Aerospace and DASA were united against the various objections of A\u00e9rospatiale.

Yet its origins represent one of the more intriguing and unlikely stories to have emerged from the airline industry in recent times. Originally conceived as a purely domestic airline, BAE Systems agreed in mid-2001 to participate in the proposed start-up at the request of Kazakhstan's head of state, President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in order to facilitate an air radar contract it was then negotiating with the Government of Kazakhstan. Sir Richard Evans, BAE System's chairman at the time, was instrumental in and key to the deal. However, the radar contract never materialised, and subsequent senior management changes and strategic reviews at BAE Systems led to the closure of its offices in Kazakhstan. Additionally, not withstanding the support of Nazarbayev, the start-up, initially seen as a foreign entity, was confronted with immediate and vocal opposition from many elements of Kazakhstan's media and political establishment."]}, {"page": "Michael Turner (businessman)", "response": ["Both Turner and BAE's previous chairman, Sir Richard Evans, have had an abrasive relationship with senior Ministry of Defence officials.
