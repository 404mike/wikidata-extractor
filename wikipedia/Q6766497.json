But when Vaughan sacked Rush's assistant Mark Aizlewood in April, after a 1\u20130 defeat at Darlington, without his knowledge, Rush resigned on principle.

Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (\u00a315,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (\u00a335,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986\u201387 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for \u00a3840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for \u00a3110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for \u00a372,000 and \u00a3200,000 respectively. A 2\u20131 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3\u20132 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1\u20130 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's.
