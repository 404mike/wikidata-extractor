Piers Wenger said that it took \"quite a long time to get the design right\", and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking since \"futuristic\" meant nothing to the Doctor.

He designed the two-part episode as a more action-oriented sequel to \"Blink\", an episode he had written for the third series. He compared the relationship to the film Alien and its sequel Aliens, with the former being more low-key and the latter more \"highly coloured\". Moffat thought that Aliens was \"the best conceived movie sequel ever\" and decided to use it as a model. He also intended to portray the Angels and their actions differently; in \"Blink\" they were barely surviving and resembled scavengers, while in \"The Time of Angels\" he wanted them to have a plan that could become \"almost like a war\". The two-part story was intended to show the worst possible instance that could occur with the Weeping Angels, which was the inability to see, as explored in the second part, \"Flesh and Stone\", when Amy must keep her eyes closed. Executive producer Piers Wenger thought that the Delirium Archive, the museum the Doctor and Amy visited at the beginning of the episode, needed to be explained, therefore Moffat named it \"the final resting place of the Headless Monks\" and sent it to him via text message.

As he is executive producer of Being Human, he was pleased he only had to write the episode and not worry about the other aspects of production.

As the episode features many \"time-jumps\" when the Doctor travels back to do things seen in the opening credits, Moffat decided to make it less complicated by allowing the audience to figure things out before they occurred. He did this by calling attention to the future-Doctor in the opening scenes by having him wearing a fez and holding a mop, and as the viewers saw the Doctor later acquire these items they would begin to connect the events. Moffat mentioned the fez to fellow executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis; they both were worried that Smith would become too attached to the hat and want to incorporate it into his costume, but Moffat assured him that he was planning on destroying the fez.
