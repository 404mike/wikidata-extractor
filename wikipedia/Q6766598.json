The programme's producers shot hundreds of hours of interviews, but only a fraction of that recorded material was used for the final version of the series. A selection of the rest of this material was published in this book, which included interviews with Albert Speer, Karl Wolff (Himmler's adjutant), Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), James Stewart (USAAF bomber pilot and Hollywood star), Anthony Eden, John Colville (Private Secretary to Winston Churchill), Averell Harriman (US Ambassador to the Soviet Union) and Arthur \"Bomber\" Harris (Head of RAF Bomber Command)."]}, {"page": "Friedrich Paulus", "response": ["Many English language sources and publications from the 1940s to the present day give Paulus' family name the prefix \"von\".
