Speaking after being announced as Stoke's new manager, Hughes admitted that he had a point to prove following his disappointing spell at QPR. Hughes' first task was to release Rory Delap, Mamady Sidibe, Matthew Upson, Dean Whitehead, Carlo Nash and Matty Lund, at the same time giving Jermaine Pennant a new contract. He made his first signing on 28 June 2013 in Dutch international left-back Erik Pieters from PSV for a fee of \u20ac3.6\u00a0million (\u00a33\u00a0million). Hughes' first match in charge of Stoke on 17 August 2013 ended in a 1\u20130 defeat at Liverpool. Hughes' first win as Stoke manager came in his next match as Stoke beat Crystal Palace 2\u20131 at the Britannia Stadium. This was followed up by a 1\u20130 win away at West Ham. On 2 September 2013, transfer deadline day, Hughes brought in Austrian forward Marko Arnautovi\u0107 from Werder Bremen and Stephen Ireland on loan from Aston Villa.

Despite this, Lawrence still made 23 starts and 10 substitute appearances for the club, scoring against Fulham, Chelsea, and Sunderland's bitter rivals Newcastle United at St James' Park. Although the season ended in disaster for Sunderland, who were relegated with a then record low of 15 points, Lawrence ended the season as runner up to teammate Dean Whitehead for the annual Player of the Year award, and was seen as one of Sunderland's better performers.

Four consecutive defeats then followed, including a 5\u20131 defeat away at Peterborough United on 31 October.

Sunderland manager Roy Keane also stated after the signing of Ferdinand that he viewed him as a future England International. Ferdinand made a promising start to his Sunderland career in a partnership formed with Danny Collins but Sunderland's poor results at the start of the 2008\u201309 season saw Keane experiment with several different back four line-ups resulting in Ferdinand being in and out of the side. Following captain Dean Whitehead's departure to Stoke City in July 2009, Nyron Nosworthy took Whitehead's vacated number 6 jersey and Ferdinand switched from number 26 to number 5. Ferdinand fell out of favour with new manager Steve Bruce and first team opportunities became limited and he was not initially given a squad number for the 2010\u201311 Premier League season as loan-signing John Mensah was given Ferdinand's number 5 shirt, but was later given number 29."]}, {"page": "Chris Hackett (footballer)", "response": ["Hackett returned from injury and featured in the reserve side at the start of the following season.

Hackett was returned to the reserve side but soon regained his first-team place. He earned praise from manager Ian Atkins, who said: \"The only one that you can say has really been listening over the last few weeks is Chrissy Hackett. He came on Tuesday night and put some good crosses into the six-yard box. Other players had chances to get the ball into areas where it can hurt defenders, but didn't do it.\" However, halfway through the season Hackett and team-mate Dean Whitehead were criticised by Atkins for refusing to follow a fitness programme, an accusation denied by the pair, who claimed a misunderstanding.
