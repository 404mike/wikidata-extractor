The first, a bust by Franz Klein, was commissioned by Johann Andreas Streicher and created in 1812, while the composer was still alive. After Beethoven's death in 1827, his hometown, Bonn, immediately began planning a monument for the following year, though a cholera outbreak delayed this. A design competition was eventually held, in which a submission by Ernst Julius H\u00e4hnel beat ones from Friedrich von Amerling, Gustav Blaeser and Friedrich Drake. In 1845, H\u00e4hnel's monument was erected, due to finances given by Robert Schumann, Charles Hall\u00e9, George Thomas Smart and especially Franz Liszt. While the monument's height and simplicity were criticized, the reliefs surrounding the base were met with public approval. The statue's representation of a figure standing on a decorated base with its legs slightly apart was popular at the time, and later inspired Theodore Baur's statue of  in the Library of Congress.

He brought back other works which Beethoven hoped could be published in England. Correspondence between Neate and Beethoven continued, about publication of works and performance of works by the Philharmonic Society. Neate, George Thomas Smart and Beethoven's pupil Ferdinand Ries (who lived in London at this period) did much to publicise Beethoven's music in London.Ludwig van Beethoven, Brief an Charles Neate in London, Wien, 18.
