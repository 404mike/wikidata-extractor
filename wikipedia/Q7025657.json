He was arrested at Narita Airport on 13 April 2002 and found guilty by the Chiba Prefecture District Court in June 2003. He was sentenced to 14 years' jail with forced labour and fined \u00a55,000,000. At his trial Baker claimed that he was tricked by his travelling companion, James Prunier, into carrying the drugs through customs in a false-bottomed suitcase. Baker also claimed that during his initial detention he was mistreated by Japanese authorities with sleep deprivation, no access to legal counsel, and that he was forced to sign a confession written in poor and inaccurate English. Baker's conviction was upheld on appeal but Baker's sentence was reduced to 11 years in prison and the fine to \u00a53,000,000. Baker was transferred back to England in the Spring of 2008 to serve the remainder of his sentence.\nAfter spending six-months at London's Wandsworth prison, Baker was released on licence in October 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nick Baker (disputed conviction)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas John Baker"]}, {"page": "Nick Baker (Chef)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas John Baker"]}, {"page": "Nick Baker (chef)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas John Baker"]}, {"page": "Nick Baker (prisoner in Japan)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas John Baker"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Baker", "response": ["*Nicholas John Baker, British citizen who was convicted of smuggling cocaine and ecstasy into Japan"]}]}}
