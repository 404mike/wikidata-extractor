S\u012bl\u0101c\u0101ra or himself would be unable properly establish a Sangha in the West. This marked the end of Metteyya's time as a dedicated Buddhist Missionary to England. Metteyya had stated that one who lives his true vocation of this life as a Bhikkhu, must of followed the Vinaya accordingly to prove himself against temptations as a religious teacher amongst his fellow-men, to be wise and worthy so that he be a living example through the actions of his life. While Metteyya's determination to return was great, his health was rapidly declining.
