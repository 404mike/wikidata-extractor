In 1974 the school became a comprehensive school and was renamed Hanley Castle High School. At this stage, although there were still pupils under the age of 14, the new intake of pupils came each year by transfer of pupils from \"The Hill School\" (now closed) at Tunnel Hill, Upton-upon-Severn. Prior to that The Hill had been a state secondary school for children aged 11\u201318. The Hill was renamed \"The Hill Junior High School\" in 1974 as part of the same round of changes. In 1991, Hanley Castle High School returned to being an age 11\u201318 High School following the two-tier school system, and the Hill Junior High School was closed.
