This was probably part of the cutting-down to size of Charteris' intelligence empire. A separate section\u2014Staff Duties under Maj-Gen Guy Dawnay\u2014covered organisation, training, anti-aircraft and (briefly) machine guns. In June Staff Duties gained control of censorship and publicity (formerly part of intelligence) and transport (formerly a separate department under Eric Geddes) was put back under the Quartermaster-General (now Sir Travers Clarke). No evidence has been found as to whether Haig supported or resisted these changes. Better BEF performance that year probably owed something to greater efficiency at GHQ, although greater delegation to corps and divisional commanders was probably also a factor.Harris 2008, p. 464"]}, {"page": "Chatham Dining Club", "response": ["The Chatham Dining Club is a general interest Dining club based in London, United Kingdom.
