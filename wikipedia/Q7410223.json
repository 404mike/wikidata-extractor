He was educated at Loughborough Grammar School.\nSampson Handley trained as a medical doctor at Guy's Hospital from 1889 where he qualified in 1895 and became an MD the following year. He took in an interest in pathology as a route to becoming a surgeon and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1897.He worked at the cancer research wing at the Middlesex Hospital where he researched the methods by which cancer spread. He found that the main extension of breast cancer was along the lymphatics and he coined the words Lymphatic permeation. In 1905 he became an Assistant Surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital and continued his research into cancer. In 1906 he published Cancer of the Breast and its Operative Treatment which created his reputation with the wider medical establishment. In 1911 he was awarded the Walker Prize by the Royal College of Surgeons for advancing the knowledge of the pathology and therapeutics of cancer. As well as his work with cancer he was also a skilled abdominal surgeon.During the first world war he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a captain. For his work he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, a foreign Member of the Academy of Medicine of Rome. He was vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons from 1931 to 1934.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Radical mastectomy", "response": ["According to the Halsted-Meyer theory, the major pathway for breast cancer dissemination was through the lymphatic ducts. Therefore, it was thought that performing wider and more mutilating surgeries that removed a greater number of lymph nodes would result in greater chances of cure. From 1920 onwards, many surgeons performed surgeries more invasive than the original procedure by Halsted. Sampson Handley noted Halsted's observation of the existence of malignant metastasis to the chest wall and breast bone via the chain of internal mammary nodes under the sternum and employed an \"extended\" radical mastectomy that included the removal of the lymph nodes located there and the implantation of radium needles into the anterior intercostal spaces. This line of study was extended by his son, Richard S. Handley, who studied internal mammary chain nodal involvement in breast cancer and demonstrated that 33% of 150 breast cancer patients had internal mammary chain involvement at the time of surgery. The radical mastectomy was subsequently extended by a number of surgeons such as Sugarbaker and Urban to include removal of internal mammary lymph nodes. Eventually, this \"extended\" radical mastectomy was extended even further to include removal of the supraclavicular lymph nodes at the time of mastectomy by Dahl-Iversen and Tobiassen. Some surgeons like Prudente even went as far as amputating the upper arm en bloc with the mastectomy specimen in an attempt to cure relatively advanced local disease. This increasingly radical progression culminated in the \u2018super-radical\u2019 mastectomy which consisted of complete excision of all breast tissue, axillary content, removal of the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major and minor muscles and dissection of the internal mammary lymph nodes. After retrospective analysis, the extended radical mastectomies were abandoned as these massive and disabling operations proved to be not superior to those of the standard radical mastectomies."]}, {"page": "William Handley", "response": ["* William Sampson Handley, English surgeon"]}, {"page": "Hunterian Oration", "response": ["*1939 Sampson Handley, Makers of John Hunter "]}, {"page": "W.
