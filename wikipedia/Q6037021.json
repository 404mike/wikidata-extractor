This work, called the Russian Synodal Bible, is widely used by Protestant and even Catholic communities all over Russia and in the former soviet states, and is also used by many Russian Orthodox adherents for all kinds of teaching and private study, outside of liturgical use (for which the Old Church Slavonic version is preferred). More recently, several modern translations have appeared.The Bible Society in Russia, in Russian The Bible Society in Russia, between its establishment in 1813 and 1826, distributed more than 500,000 Bible-related books in 41 languages of Russia.  This early work was led by Dr John Paterson, D.D. (1776 - 1855) a young Scottish Minister.  Dr Paterson was granted an ukase to publish bibles by Tsar Alexander I who actively supported the work of the Bible Society in Russia and provided a building beside the Catherine Canal (now Kanala Griboevova) for the Society's use.  The work of the Society ended when Nicholas 1 placed the Society under the control of the Holy Synod.  Dr Paterson returned to Scotland and lived until 1855 on a pension from Tsar Nicholas.  Several times in the 19th and 20th centuries, activities of the Society were stopped by reactionary policies of the Russian Government."]}, {"page": "Richard Knill", "response": ["He was accepted by the London Missionary Society, and embarked for Madras 20 April 1816.
