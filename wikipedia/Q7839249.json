The Sun and consequently most other newspapers in their later editions ran with the leaked version of the report. Delivered by an unnamed source over the telephone to Sun political editor Trevor Kavanagh, the leaked version accurately described the report's main findings. All sides involved in the Inquiry denounced the leak. Lord Hutton launched a further inquiry into how the report came to be leaked. This second inquiry, carried out by a solicitor, reported on 11 August 2004, but failed to find the source of the leak. It also said there were \"no particular weaknesses\" in the security of the report and so offered no suggestions of how a similar leak might be prevented in the future."]}, {"page": "Ann Clwyd", "response": ["On 12 March 2003, James Mahon made first mention of the claims that some Iraqis were killed in plastic shredders or wooden chippers, when he addressed the House of Commons after returning from research in northern Iraq. Six days later, Clwyd wrote an article in The Times entitled \"See men shredded, then say you don't back war,\" saying that an unnamed Iraqi had said that Saddam and Qusay Hussein fed opponents of their Baathist rule into a plastic shredder or wood chipper, and then used their shredded bodies as fish food. Later she would add that it was believed to be housed in Abu Ghraib prison, and spoke with an unidentified person who claimed the American-sourced shredders were dismantled \"just before the military got there\". As the first journalist to state the unsubstantiated claim, the rolling effect of the gruesome verbal picture garnered wider media and international political support, including from Australian Prime Minister John Howard, for an invasion of Iraq. The Sun's political editor Trevor Kavanagh wrote in February 2004 that as a result of Clwyd's article \"Public opinion swung behind Tony Blair, as voters learned how Saddam fed dissidents feet first into industrial shredders.\" As she had been vocal and prominent in her concern for the situation in Iraq before the war, Tony Blair made her a Special Envoy on Human Rights in Iraq in the run-up to the war."]}, {"page": "Reigate Grammar School", "response": ["*Trevor Kavanagh, political editor of The Sun"]}, {"page": "Pre-election day events of the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["The date of 5 May coincided with the date set for local elections for county councils in England and local councils in Northern Ireland.

The date was suggested on 24 November 2004 by the British newspaper The Sun.
