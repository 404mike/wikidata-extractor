Alek's parents were killed by part of the order. Alek attempted to kiss Chloe in the first episode, but was stopped by Jasmine before he could. He acts as her protector, and helps keep her from harm. He has a habit of cracking jokes and teasing Chloe about aspects of the Mai's abilities and attributes. Alek eventually ends up falling in love with Chloe. In episode 7, Alek comes to Chloe, tells her that they belong together and kisses her and she kisses him back. Alek goes to Paul and seeks advice on how to woo Chloe. Paul reveals that there is nothing more important to Chloe than her friends. Later, Alek tells Chloe that he wants the duty of Chloe's protector to be removed so that if Chloe ever ends up in trouble he can be there because he wants to, not because he has to. It is revealed in the series finale that Zane is his brother."]}]}}
