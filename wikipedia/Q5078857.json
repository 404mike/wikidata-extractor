In spite of Grote's school successes, his father refused to send him to university and sent him to work at the bank. He spent all his spare time in the study of classics, history, metaphysics and political economy and in learning German, French and Italian. Driven by his mother's Puritanism and his father's contempt for academic learning, he sought other friends, one of whom was Charles Hay Cameron, who strengthened him in his love of philosophy. Through another friend, George W. Norman, he met his wife, Harriet Lewin (1792\u20131878), a writer and later the biographer of the artist Ary Scheffer. After various difficulties the marriage took place on 5 March 1820, and was a happy one. His wife's nephew was the actor William Terriss, the father of Ellaline Terriss.

He was part of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. He served as the British Diplomat in Tehran from May 1920 to October 1921. Serving under Lord Curzon, he was instrumental in the ascension of Hassan Pirnia to the role of prime minister. Relations between Lord Curzon and Herman Cameron Norman became sour after Norman's tenure, so much so that Lord Curzon refused to see Herman upon his return from Tehran. Lord Curzon held the belief that Norman was singularly responsible for the failure of the British control of Iran. Norman, who did not back down from how he felt about the incompetence of Mostowfi ol-Mamalek communicated to Lord Curzon about how the current British policy towards Iran is unpopular with the Iranian population and would cause more harm for Britain in the long-run. Norman retired in 1924 after refusing the post of minister to Santiago."]}]}}
