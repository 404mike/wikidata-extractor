The conventional view has always been more favourable: \"When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art\" (Jonathan Richardson: An Essay on the Theory of Painting, 1715, 41).

Samuel Cooper (1609-1672) was an accomplished miniaturist in Hilliard's tradition, as was his brother Alexander Cooper (1609-1660), and their uncle, John Hoskins (1589/1590\u20131664). Other notable portraitists of the period include: Thomas Flatman (1635-1688), Richard Gibson (1615-1690), the dissolute John Greenhill (c. 1644\u20131676), John Riley (1646-1691), and John Michael Wright (1617-1694). Francis Barlow (c. 1626 \u2013 1704) is known as \"the father of British sporting painting\"; he was England's first wildlife painter, beginning a tradition that reached a high-point a century later, in the work of George Stubbs (1724-1806). English women began painting professionally in the 17th century; notable examples include Joan Carlile (c. 1606\u201379), and Mary Beale (n\u00e9e Cradock; 1633\u20131699).", "File:Walker, Robert John - Evelyn.jpg|Robert Walker's portrait of diarist John Evelyn; 1648."]}, {"page": "Raby Castle", "response": ["| Robert Walker"]}, {"page": "Mary Beale", "response": ["Mary received no formal training from an academy, had no connection to an artist guild, and no royal or courtly patronage. She received a humanist education from her father, who is most likely the one who taught Mary how to draw and paint.

The exact time of Mary's introduction to Lely is debated and one theory has the two meeting prior to her marriage to Charles, when she was living in Suffolk. The other theory has the pair meeting in either 1655 or 1656 when Mary and Charles moved to Convent Garden in London and became Lely's neighbour."]}, {"page": "1599 in art", "response": ["**Robert Walker \u2013 English portrait painter (died 1658)"]}, {"page": "1658 in art", "response": ["**Robert Walker, English portrait painter (born 1599)"]}, {"page": "1658 in England", "response": ["* Robert Walker, portrait painter (born 1599)"]}, {"page": "John Michael Wright", "response": ["Much of the scholarly appreciation of Wright's work is fairly recent. In 1982, an exhibition of his work: \u2018John Michael Wright \u2013 The King\u2019s Painter\u2019 \u2013 in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery \u2013 led to a renewed interest in his contributions, and the catalogue (edited by Sara Stevenson and Duncan Thomson) re-wrote and uncovered much of the known biographical details. New works continue to be discovered and previously known ones re-attributed to him. Wright is now viewed as amongst the most successful of seventeenth-century Britain's indigenous artists, and is rated alongside contemporaries such as Robert Walker and William Dobson. One modern exhibition catalogue described him as \"the finest seventeenth century British-born painter\". Certainly, he was one of the few who painted the elite aristocracy of his day, and was responsible for some of the most magnificent royal portraiture surviving. This achievement is particularly significant in an age where even British patrons had tended to favour foreign artists like Holbein and Van Dyck, and would continue to favour immigrants such as Lely and Kneller. Indeed, part of the reason for Wright's success is recognised as being his unusually cosmopolitan training: no prior British artist had so much exposure to European influence. During his Italian sojourn, and his participation in the Accademia di San Luca, not only had Wright collected works attributed to continental giants like Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, he had also been influenced by, and even copied, much of their tone and style."]}, {"page": "Cromwell Museum", "response": ["The museum has a number of portraits of Cromwell and his family, including two by Robert Walker (d.1658), a copy of the famous \"warts, and everything\" portrait by Sir Peter Lely (1618-1680), a significant late portrait of Cromwell by Edward Mascall, and several miniatures in the style of Samuel Cooper.Cromwell Museum, BBC \"Your Paintings\" project, bbc.co.uk, accessed 5 May 2013 The museum has a number of coins from the era plus several portrait medals, including a copy of the Lord Protector medal also by Thomas Simon."]}, {"page": "Joseph Nutting", "response": ["Nutting's style resembled that of Robert White.
