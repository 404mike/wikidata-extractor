After some time without progress, radio presenter Margaret Knight backed a popular movement among Humanists UK's membership to commission such a logo, triggering publicity officer Tom Vernon to announce the competition. Of the several hundred designs from a number of countries that were considered, Dennis Barrington's simple design was favoured for its perceived universalism. Within the space of a few years, the logo had emerged as a symbol of Humanism, not just of Humanists UK and was adopted by humanist organisations around the world."]}, {"page": "Thomas Vernon", "response": ["* Tom Vernon (1939\u20132013), British broadcaster and writer"]}, {"page": "Tom Vernon (Broadcaster)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Vernon"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 September \u2013 Tom Vernon, 74, writer and broadcaster (Fat Man series)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2013", "response": ["*Tom Vernon, 74, British writer and broadcaster (Fat Man series), heart attack.Obituaries: Tom Vernon"]}, {"page": "1939 in British radio", "response": ["* 23 April \u2013 Tom Vernon, broadcaster (died 2013)"]}]}}
