In his last years he was a member of the British and Irish Communist Organisation.He is best remembered as the author of Imperialism: Pioneer of Capitalism. This unconventional Marxist analysis was published posthumously in 1980 and is still being debated. He rejected the argument of Lenin's Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, that capitalist development outside of Europe had ceased to be possible.  He considered that he was restoring the original view of Marx and Engels, particularly in regard to the results of Britain's rule in India: namely that imperialism plays a progressive role in fostering the spread of capitalism worldwide, which is a prerequisite for socialism.Some commentators have likened Warren's ideas on capitalism, particularly his belief that the creation of a global market is required for the creation of a Communist society, to other thinkers, such as the Revolutionary Communist Party and Nigel Harris.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Warren", "response": ["* Bill Warren (baseball) (1884\u20131960), American baseball player", "* Bill Warren (communist) (1935\u20131978)", "* Bill Warren (film historian and critic) (1943\u20132016), American film historian and critic", "* Bill Warren (businessman), American corporate human resource executive"]}, {"page": "Bill Warren (British Communist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Warren (communist)"]}, {"page": "Ernest Mandel", "response": ["* Discussion with Bill Warren."]}, {"page": "Robin Murray (economist)", "response": ["In Internationalisation of Capital and the Nation State (1971) Murray argued that the internationalisation of capital weakened the political power of the nation state. His theses in this article were criticised at the time by Bill Warren, who found in particular Murray's discussion of \"territorial non-coincidence\" unconvincing. With Murray advocating the view that ultra-imperialism was displacing national capitalisms, and Warren instead claiming that imperialism was being replaced by those capitalisms, Robert Rowthorn took an intermediate view, predicting a future of nationalist rivalries."]}]}}
