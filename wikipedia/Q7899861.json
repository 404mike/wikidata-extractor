He travelled to Italy in early 1973, to play with the Neapolitan Italian / Celtic chanteuse, Jenny Sorrenti. He lived and rehearsed with Sorrenti's band, 'Saint Just', in the House on the Lake on Lake Bracciano, that led to the album of the same name, but before the recording, Blitz left Italy to join the Doctors of Madness in June 1974.\nWith Doctors of Madness, Blitz further developed his unique counterpoint electric violin style, incorporating a garage rock edge to complement the Doctor's nihilistic, manic, approach to rock music; using fuzz box, wah-wah pedal, phasing, echoplex and reverberation to appropriate effect. He cited avant garde violinists Jean-Luc Ponty, Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and John Cale of the Velvet Underground as his main influences; having largely rejected his early classical training.\nBlitz was also an adventurous violin designer and maker, and in the early 1970s produced the first \u2018skeleton\u2019 electric violin design that is widely copied and adapted in mass-produced electric violins today. Blitz's multifaceted lead guitar work also made a significant impact throughout the Doctors' music.In the mid 1970s, Blitz did occasional freelance studio work, playing the electric violin solo on \"Watch Out Carolina\", produced by David Essex, for The Real Thing, and he also showed some flair as a producer himself, working with York punk rock band The Jermz on their singles \"Powercut\" and Me and My Baby.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Electric violin", "response": ["It is used extensively in folk rock; one prominent exponent in the area being Dave Swarbrick. Folk metal band Turisas also puts a lot of emphasis on the electric violin in their compositions. Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani also focuses in Jaakko Lemmetty's electric violin parts. It has also found its way into modern musical theater, a recent example being Whistle Down the Wind by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Several popular bands that use the electric violin are Zox, Operator Please, Doll Factory, and pop punk band Yellowcard.

It is tuned an octave below normal violin, i.e. between viola and cello. It was developed in USA by Barcus-Berry in the early 1960s. Jean-Luc Ponty, Micha\u0142 Urbaniak and Elek Bacsik were among the first jazz violinists to play it.
