He introduced the Ward\u2013Takahashi identity, also known as \"Ward Identity\" (or \"Ward's Identities\"). Andrei Sakharov said Ward was one of the titans of quantum electrodynamics. He made significant contributions to quantum solid-state physics, statistical mechanics and the Ising model.\nWard was one of the authors of the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions: his contributions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam. He is also credited with being an early advocate of the use of Feynman diagrams. It has been said that physicists have made use of his principles and developments \"often without knowing it, and generally without quoting him.\"In 1955, Ward was recruited to work at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. There, he independently derived a version of the Teller-Ulam design, for which he has been called the \"father of the British H-bomb\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
