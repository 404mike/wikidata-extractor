In August 2001, he joined Swansea City of the Third Division on an initial one-month loan. On 29 September, he was sent off for a foul on goalkeeper Stuart Brock two minutes after coming on as a substitute in a 2\u20130 win over Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, though manager Colin Addison said that he intended to appeal the decision as Tyson was \"only a fraction from taking the ball\". Tyson scored his first goal in the Football League on 23 October, helping the \"Swans\" to a 2\u20130 win over Darlington at Vetch Field. He returned to the Third Division towards the end of the 2001\u201302 season, joining Cheltenham Town on loan in March 2002. Manager Steve Cotterill signed him to help the club push for the play-offs, and Tyson scored one goal from one start and seven substitute appearances in the league, but did not feature in the play-offs as the \"Robins\" went on to secure promotion with a 3\u20131 victory over Rushden & Diamonds in the play-off final."]}, {"page": "Brock (surname)", "response": ["*Stuart Brock (born 1976), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["|Stuart Brock"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Stuart Brock||GK||||West Bromwich||||0||0||Aston Villa||27 March 1997||Free", "| GK || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Stuart Brock"]}]}}
