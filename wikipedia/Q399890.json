Mikey Craig of Culture Club, Joe Leeway of Thompson Twins and Tracy Wormworth of The Waitresses were also black.

In the final week of March, it was in \"heavy rotation\", one week before the MTV debut of Jackson's \"Beat It\" video. Prince's \"Little Red Corvette\" joined both videos in heavy rotation at the end of April. At the beginning of June, \"Electric Avenue\" by Eddy Grant joined \"Billie Jean\", which was still in heavy rotation until mid-June. At the end of August, \"She Works Hard for the Money\" by Donna Summer was in heavy rotation on the channel. Herbie Hancock's \"Rockit\" and Lionel Richie's \"All Night Long\" were placed in heavy rotation at the end of October and the beginning of November respectively. In the final week of November, Donna Summer's \"Unconditional Love\" was in heavy rotation. When Jackson's elaborate video for \"Thriller\" was released late that year, raising the bar for what a video could be, the network's support for it was total; subsequently, more pop and R&B videos were played on MTV."]}, {"page": "March 5", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Eddy Grant, Guyanese-British singer-songwriter and musician"]}, {"page": "Soweto", "response": ["Soweto is mentioned in the anti-apartheid song \"Gimme Hope Jo'anna\" by Eddy Grant.
