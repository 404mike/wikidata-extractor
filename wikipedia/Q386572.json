His work in the field of Aeolian processes was the basis for the book The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes, establishing the discipline of aeolian geomorphology, combining field work observations, experiments and physical equations. His work has been used by United States' space agency NASA in its study of the terrain of the planet Mars, the Bagnold Dunes on Mars' surface being named after him by the organization.During the Second World War, he was a soldier in the British Army, in which he founded the behind-the-lines reconnaissance, espionage and raiding unit that was named the \"Long Range Desert Group\", serving as its first commanding officer in the North Africa Campaign.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Operation Salam", "response": ["The diary of Alm\u00e1sy describing the events from 15 to 29 May 1942 surfaced in Austria in 1949 or 1950, found by Lt. Col. Count Peter de Salis, who was at the time working for the Intelligence Organization, Allied Commission for Austria. Seeing the name of Bagnold mentioned several times in the document, de Salis forwarded the diary to Brigadier Ralph Alger Bagnold through intelligence channels. It is not known at what point was the original German text translated into English, however two versions remain. One which was passed on by Bagnold to David Lloyd Owen, and is kept in the Imperial War Museum. This copy was found by Michael Rolke when doing some unrelated research, and formed the basis for the German re-translation that appeared in the re-publication of the German version of Alm\u00e1sy\u2019s \"Unknown Sahara\" in 1987 (Schwimmer in der W\u00fcste, Haymon, Innsbruck). Another version was prepared by Jean Howard (n\u00e9e Alington), who received the English translation from Bagnold in 1978, together with the cover note of Count de Salis and other forwarders. She re-typed the documents, correcting a number of errors and mis-translations based on her superior knowledge of German, however at the same time also making some abbreviations to reduce the task of re-typing. This is also the source of the uncertainty regarding the finding date, as the note of de Salis (as copied by Jean Howard) dates 28 January 1950, while the later forwarding note dates 2 February 1949, obviously one having been copied in error. The original diary is probably still in the unreleased MI5 Personnel File of Alm\u00e1sy. There is no question as to the authenticity of the document, the contents of which are corroborated by many sources including intercepted wireless messages. As it surfaced during Alm\u00e1sy\u2019s lifetime, it could have even been with his knowledge that it was passed to Count de Salis. The 2013 book on Operation SALAM contains a merged transcript of the IWM and the Howard copies."]}]}}
