Evans was to study with Reinhold Pauli, who had spent some years in Britain, and was a friend of Green. The study would be preparatory to doing research in modern history at G\u00f6ttingen. The arrangement may have been meant as a remedial plan. On the way to G\u00f6ttingen, Evans was sidetracked, unpropitiously for the modern history plan, by some illegal excavations at Trier. He had noticed that the tombs were being plundered surreptitiously. For the sake of preserving some artefacts, he hired a crew, performed such hasty excavations as he could, crated the material and sent it home to John.."]}, {"page": "Stanley Baldwin", "response": ["Baldwin's schools were St Michael's School, at the time located in Slough, Berkshire, followed by Harrow School. He later wrote that \"all the king's horses and all the king's men would have failed to have drawn me into the company of school masters, and in relation to them I once had every qualification as a passive resister.\" Baldwin then went on to the University of Cambridge, where he studied history at Trinity College. His time at university was blighted by the presence, as Master of Trinity, of Henry Montagu Butler, his former headmaster who had punished him at Harrow for writing a piece of schoolboy smut. He was asked to resign from the Magpie & Stump (the Trinity College debating society) for never speaking, and, after receiving a third-class degree in history, he went into the family business of iron manufacturing. His father sent him to Mason College for one session of technical training in metallurgy as preparation.K.

Especially notable were Butler's grand-uncle Henry Montagu Butler (Master of Trinity College and Dean of Gloucester) and Sir Geoffrey G. Butler, a Cambridge historian and Conservative MP for the university, Butler's uncle and a particular early influence on him.Howard, p. 1. Butler's father was a Fellow, and in later life the Master, of Pembroke College.Howard, p. 3.", "In Michaelmas 1923, as Secretary, he persuaded the Cambridge Union to affiliate to the National Union of Students, of which he became a Vice-President.Howard 1987, p. 22. Psychiatric illness was then still little understood. In November 1923 his college put him in the care of a doctor and in December 1923 his uncle Cyril sent him to a specialist in Bristol, after which he made a recovery from his breakdown.Jago 2015, p.30 On 11 March 1924, after taking office as President of the Cambridge Union, he entertained the Leader of the Opposition, Stanley Baldwin, at the Change of Officers Debate to oppose the motion that \"This House has the Highest Regard for Rhetoric\". The following morning, Rab had to escort Baldwin back to the railway station, where, according to one version of the story, Baldwin bought him a copy of Something Fresh by P. G. Wodehouse with an admonition not to take life too seriously.Butler 1971, p. 16. Baldwin's career at Harrow and Trinity, Cambridge had suffered from a poor relationship with one of Butler's relatives, Henry Montagu Butler. Winston Churchill (then out of Parliament and an independent \"Constitutionalist\" candidate in the 19 March 1924 Westminster Abbey by-election) had agreed to speak in favour of the motion but had not been able to attend.Howard 1987, p. 24. At the end of his third year (1924), he received a Second in German. He graduated as a BA in 1924.Howard 1987, p. 25. Howard quotes a letter from his father, who was openly disappointed, and is clear that he was awarded his BA that summer despite his being about to stay on for a further year of undergraduate study (a student at Cambridge normally needs to pass a Part I and a Part II, not necessarily in the same subject, to obtain a BA). Jago (2015, p.30) states that his third year only counted as \"General Studies\" but that he needed a fourth year to obtain Honours.", "Butler remained on the Conservative front bench into the next year. Harold Wilson felt that the Conservatives had made Butler a scapegoat after the Daily Express incident during the election, and on 23 December 1964 he offered him the job of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge (where his great-uncle Henry Montagu Butler had previously been Master, and where the incumbent Lord Adrian was due to retire on 30 June 1965). Butler did not accept until the middle of January, and took office at the start of the new academic year on 7 October 1965. On 19 February 1965 he was created a life peer as Baron Butler of Saffron Walden, of Halstead in the County of Essex; because of his appointment as master he sat as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords.
