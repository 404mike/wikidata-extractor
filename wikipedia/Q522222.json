These deaths, Jones stressed, may not only be seen as a genocide, but they may also be seen as an eliticide, meaning \"targeting the better educated and leadership oriented elements among the Tibetan population.\" Patrick French, the former director of the Free Tibet Campaign in London, writes that the Free Tibet Campaign and other groups have claimed that a total of 1.2 million Tibetans were killed by the Chinese since 1950 but after examining archives in Dharamsala, he found \"no evidence to support that figure.\" French states that a reliable alternative number is unlikely to be known but estimates that as many as half a million Tibetans died \"as a 'direct result' of the policies of the People's Republic of China\", using historian Warren Smith's estimate of 200,000 people who are missing from population statistics in the Tibet Autonomous Region and extending that rate to the borderland regions."]}, {"page": "V.

According to author Patrick French, A House for Mr Biswas is \"universal in the way that the work of Dickens or Tolstoy is universal; the book makes no apologies for itself, and does not contextualize or exoticize its characters.  It reveals a complete world.\"", "In late December 1971 as news of the killings at Michael X's commune in Arima filtered out, Naipaul, accompanied by Pat, arrived in Trinidad to cover the story.  This was a time of strains in their marriage.  Naipaul, although dependent on Pat, was frequenting prostitutes for sexual gratification. Pat was alone.  Intensifying their disaffection was Pat's childlessness, for which neither Pat nor Naipaul sought professional treatment, preferring instead to say that fatherhood would not allow time for Naipaul's sustained literary labours.  Naipaul was increasingly ill-humoured and infantile, and Pat increasingly reduced to mothering him.  Pat began to keep a diary, a practice she would continue for the next 25 years.  According to biographer Patrick French, \"Pat's diary is an essential, unparalleled record of V. S. Naipaul's later life and work, and reveals more about the creation of his subsequent books, and her role in their creation, than any other source.  It puts Patricia Naipaul on a par with other great, tragic, literary spouses such as Sonia Tolstoy, Jane Carlyle and Leonard Woolf.\"", "During his first trip to Argentina, in 1972, Naipaul met and began an affair with Margaret Murray Gooding, a married Anglo-Argentine mother of three.

In Patrick French's biography, Naipaul recounts his domestic abuse towards Margaret: \"I was very violent with her for two days with my hand\u00a0... She thought of it in terms of my passion for her\u00a0...

They claim that the large-scale introduction of prostitution, especially to Lhasa and Tsetang, took place in 1990 as a result of the influx of a predominantly male working population which added to the large population of Chinese soldiers already deployed in Tibet. In an article in The Independent newspaper in 1996, journalist Mike Dempsey observed that prostitution in Lhasa had become \"more brazen than in most other Chinese cities\" and that \"every street is full of bars and video arcades and brothels\". \"In some neighbourhoods of Lhasa... every third storefront is a brothel.\" Dempsey added that most of the prostitutes \"are from nearby Szechuan\" while \"Tibetan prostitutes, far fewer in number, service their poor clients in the rubbish-heaped alleys behind the Jokhang temple.\" In 2003 the journalist and historian Patrick French wrote that prostitution in Lhasa was \"the subject of ethnic segregation\". There were very few Tibetan prostitutes, the majority being Chinese, originally from Sichuan and Qinghai. The sex trade was \"controlled by Chinese gangs who benefit from political protection\". According to journalist Jean-Paul Mari, Jama Lingka island was developed in the 1990s with money from the Macao mafia.", "The Chinese government does not give an estimate of the number of brothels in Tibet because prostitution is officially banned in China. However, estimated figures on the number of brothels in Lhasa are provided by a number of sources. These include organizations close to the Tibetan Government in Exile, the documentary filmmaker Ngawang Choephel, the academic Frederic Lenoir and the writer and historian Patrick French. The figures range from 300 to 1806 depending on the source. The term \"brothel\" covers prostitution taking place in premises disguised as hair salons, beauty salons, massage parlors, hostess bars and karaoke bars.", "Ngawang Choephel, speaking on Voice of America in 1998, claimed that there were more than 1806 \"Chinese brothels\" in Lhasa. In 1999, the London-based Tibet Information Network conducted a study that identified \"at least 658 brothels\" in Lhasa. Patrick French returning from a trip to Tibet in 1999, indicated that he had found them to be an important phenomenon in Lhasa, and that \"there are now hundreds of brothels there\". In 2000 and 2002, a figure of 1000 brothels was put forward in a paper presented at the United Nations and in an article in The Boston Globe citing the same source. Between 1998 and 2005 the number of brothels increased to 1600, according to the Tibetan Women's Association.
