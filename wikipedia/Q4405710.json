Next there were \"the Kingbees\" and \"the System\", with whom he formed Beggars Opera in 1969.\nHe has played in his own outfit with this band, \"Beggars Opera\", and also with friends David Bowie and Iggy Pop. For Bowie he played lead guitar on the 1977 album Low. For Pop he worked on his album Lust for Life the same year: the issue included \"The Passenger\", regarded as one of Pop's best songs, for which Gardiner composed the music. Bowie biographer David Buckley described it as being \"possessed with one of the greatest riffs of all time\".On 19 October 1977 Gardiner was selected by Tony Visconti to play guitar for the pre-recorded backing of Bowie's performance on \"Heroes\" on the BBC's Top of the Pops. The recording was made at Good Earth Studios in Soho, London with Bowie, Visconti and pianist Sean Mayes. Gardiner emulated Robert Fripp's guitar sound by using feedback as he had not realised an EBow had been used: \"I was asked to reproduce Robert Fripp's line\", he told Stephen Dalton in 2001, \"I did not realise at the time that he [Fripp] had used an EBow. I did my best using feedback alone. As we went through the song, my amplifier started dying. As the song finished, so did the amp.\". \nSince the 1970s Gardiner has played and composed in a variety of music styles, including ambient, classical and rock. \nIn 2017 photographs Gardiner took at the Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville, during the making of David Bowie's Low album in 1977, were included in a hardcover book that accompanied the vinyl and CD box set of A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982), alongside photographs by Anton Corbijn, Helmut Newton, Andrew Kent, Steve Shapiro, Duffy and more.\nGardiner says he suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, which he believes he contracted through exposure to high levels of computer radiation and magnetic fields.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)", "response": ["Lust for Life was recorded at Hansa Studio by the Wall in West Berlin from May to June 1977, with production being handled by Bowie, Pop, and engineer Colin Thurston. The touring band of Pop, Bowie, guitarist Ricky Gardiner, and brothers Tony Fox and Hunt Sales on bass and drums, respectively, comprised the primary lineup for the album. After The Idiot was mostly composed by Bowie, Pop was adamant about having more control over Lust for Life, often composing his own arrangements, including for \"Sixteen\". This resulted in a hard rock and proto-punk sound more akin to his older style with the band the Stooges. Pop would use Bowie's arrangements for some songs, including the well-known title track.", "Bowie declined to promote Low, opting instead to support Pop on a tour of his own.

With Bowie playing keyboards, he assembled a band that included Ricky Gardiner on guitar, with brothers and future Tin Machine bandmates Tony Fox and Hunt Sales on bass and drums, respectively. Rehearsals for The Idiot tour began in mid-February 1977 and, according to Gardiner, went very well. He said Bowie was fine with restricting his involvement, not appearing to \"undermine\" Pop at all. The tour, Pop's first since the demise of the Stooges, began on March\u00a01. The opening act was American rock band Blondie, who Bowie and Pop invited after the pair heard the band's 1976 debut album. Songs played included popular Stooges numbers, a couple of tracks from The Idiot, and songs that would appear on Pop's follow-up Lust for Life (1977). Bowie was adamant about not taking the spotlight away from Pop, often staying behind his keyboard and not addressing the audience; Giovanni Dadomo of Sounds reported, \"If you wanted David, you also got the band.\" Pop's stage presence was praised, although some, including Nick Kent, believed that Bowie was still in charge. The tour lasted until April\u00a016, 1977. The Idiot and his subsequent tour earned Pop greater fame and success than he had ever achieved with the Stooges. However, during interviews, he was often asked about Bowie more than his own work. As a result, Pop took a more direct approach when making Lust for Life, resulting in a sound more reminiscent of his earlier work."]}, {"page": "Low (David Bowie album)", "response": ["The Low sessions began on 1\u00a0September 1976.

Returning from the Station to Station sessions were guitarist Carlos Alomar, bassist George Murray and percussionist Dennis Davis. Along with Eno, new members included Roy Young, the former keyboardist for the Rebel Rousers, and Ricky Gardiner, former guitarist of Beggars Opera.

Bowie was keen for Alomar to join his band for the Diamond Dogs tour, but negotiations with Bowie's management stalled and Alomar stayed with The Main Ingredient. During a six-week break from his tour in mid-1974, Bowie recorded a series of songs for a new album in Sigma Sound Studios with Alomar, who brought in Vandross, Clark, Davis, and bassist Emir Kassan to contribute to the recordings as well. Most of the material for the Young Americans album was recorded during these sessions, and Alomar joined Bowie for the second leg of the Diamond Dogs tour (dubbed \"The Philly Dogs Tour\") in September\u2013December 1974. In January 1975, Bowie and John Lennon recorded \"Across the Universe\" at Electric Lady Studios and from this session resulted the impromptu song \"Fame\", which evolved from the guitar riff Alomar had originated for the song \"Foot Stompin'\" during the Philly Dogs shows. With writing credit divided between Bowie, Alomar and Lennon (and funky guitar riffs later copied for James Brown's 1975 recording \"Hot (I Need to be Loved)\"), \"Fame\" gave Bowie his first US#1 single, and its parent album Young Americans (1975) marked Carlos Alomar's first appearance on a David Bowie album. This began a long period of collaboration in which Alomar led the rhythm section of Alomar/Dennis Davis/George Murray that would underpin Bowie's recordings for the next half-decade, behind a variety of lead guitarists, including Earl Slick, Stacey Heydon, Ricky Gardiner, Robert Fripp, and Adrian Belew.Carlos Alomar.
