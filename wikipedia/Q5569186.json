Novak won the golden boot award and was bought by League One side Huddersfield Town for a fee that has brought Gateshead a North East non-league record fee of \u00a3150,000. His team retained their Conference National status in 2009\u201310, finishing above the relegation zone on goal difference (though this was later made into a two-point gap after Salisbury City were expelled from the division). On 28 April 2010, Bogie signed a new two-year contract which made him Gateshead's first full-time manager in over half a century. Under his charge the \"Tynesiders\" posted a 14th-place finish in 2010\u201311, reaching the semi-final of the FA Trophy and winning the Durham Challenge Cup. Gateshead pushed on again in 2011\u201312, flirting around the play-off spots all season before finishing in eighth position; they also reached the FA Cup second round and the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy. He signed a one-year extension to his contract in May 2012. He then lost top-scorer Jon Shaw to Luton Town, and attempted to replace him with former Hartlepool United stalwart James Brown. He further signed defender Glenn Wilson, goalkeeper Adam Bartlett, attacker Ryan Donaldson, and defender Chris Bush. However, after opening the 2012\u201313 season with six leagues without defeat, Gateshead struggled with poor form. On 10 December 2012, Bogie and assistant Terry Mitchell were relieved of their duties at the club."]}, {"page": "Michael Rankine", "response": ["After his contract at Scunthorpe expired, he had a period with former club Armthorpe Welfare to help his fitness, before joining Alfreton Town of the Conference North in January 2006.

He next scored with two goals in a 3\u20131 victory over League One club Yeovil Town in the FA Cup first round in November. He signed a new two-year contract with Rushden in March 2007, which contracted him at the club until the summer of 2009, with the option of a further two years.
