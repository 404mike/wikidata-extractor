Best known in the late 1960s and early 1970s for his topical comedy songs performed on British television, his work ranged from satirical to bawdy to sentimental to pastoral, with a strong emphasis on storytelling, making him difficult to categorise.Thackray sang in a lugubrious baritone voice, accompanying himself on a nylon-strung guitar in a style that was part classical, part jazz. His witty lyrics and clipped delivery, combined with his strong Yorkshire accent and the northern setting of many of his songs, led to him being described as the \"North Country No\u00ebl Coward\", a comparison Thackray resisted, although he acknowledged his lyrics were in the English tradition of Coward and Flanders and Swann, \"who are wordy, funny writers\". However, his tunes derived from the French chansonnier tradition: he claimed Georges Brassens as his greatest inspiration and he was also influenced by Jacques Brel and Charles Trenet. He also admired Randy Newman. He was admired by, and influenced, many performers including Jarvis Cocker, Mike Harding, Momus, Ralph McTell, Morrissey, Alex Turner, and Jasper Carrott.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 24", "response": ["*  2002   \u2013 Jake Thackray, English singer-songwriter and guitarist (born 1938)"]}, {"page": "February 27", "response": ["*1938 \u2013 Jake Thackray, English singer-songwriter, guitarist, and journalist (d. 2002)"]}, {"page": "Monmouth", "response": ["Rockfield Studios, situated just outside the town, are where the band Queen recorded parts of their hit single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in 1975, and where Oasis recorded their multi-million selling album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? in 1995.
