Losing his left-arm at Salerno in 1943 led to him abandoning an acting career and staging his own productions including Franz Werfel's Jacobowsky and the Colonel in 1945. The London visits of the Berliner Ensemble in 1956 and the Moscow Art Theatre were organised by Daubeny.Henry Kendall (actor), in Chapter 23 of his autobiography, 'I Remember Romano's', 'An Alligator and Mr. Chaplin', (Macdonald, London, 1960), wrote that Daubney asked him in 1955 to \" ...keep an eye on his (Daubney's) revival at the Palace\", (Palace Theatre, London), of The Merry Widow, starring Jan Kiepura and Marta Eggerth, while he was on business in Paris.\nHe is best remembered for his organisation of the World Theatre Season, which brought foreign theatre companies to London between 1964 and 1975. Amongst other honours, including an OBE in the 1961 Birthday Honours and a CBE in the 1967 New Year Honours , he was knighted in the 1973 Birthday Honours.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evening Standard Theatre Awards", "response": ["*1972\u00a0\u2013 Peter Daubeny (Impresario and organizer of the annual World Theatre Season, Aldwych Theatre 1967\u20131973)"]}, {"page": "Aldwych Theatre", "response": ["On 15 December 1960, after intense speculation, it was announced that the Royal Shakespeare Company, headquartered in Stratford-upon-Avon and under the directorship of Peter Hall (director) was to make the Aldwych Theatre its base in London for the next three years.

It originated as a one-off celebration in 1964 organised by Peter Daubeny and the Royal Shakespeare Company as part of the celebrations for William Shakespeare's quatercentenary. In the 1950s, Peter Daubeny had presented foreign theatre companies, which gave him a knowledge of foreign theatre and served as a prelude to the World Theatre Seasons.Michael Denison, \u2018Daubeny, Sir Peter Lauderdale (1921\u20131975)\u2019, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.

Nevertheless, the seasons continued to be organised by Peter Daubeny without support from the Arts Council or any other official body. Theatrical companies visited from Europe, Asia and the Middle East, including evenings dedicated to Japanese n\u014d and kabuki. Appearances at the World Theatre Season sometimes led to little-known plays achieving international acclaim, as was notably the case with Welcome Msomi's Umubatha, a Zulu version of Shakespeare's Macbeth, which was presented in 1972.
