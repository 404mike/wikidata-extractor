He grew up in Coleraine with his sisters Grace (b 1903?) and Alice (b 1913?). His brother Partick was born in 1915 (?) but grew up in Barrow-in-Furness in Lancashire.\nDavid Hardman's education was interrupted by the First World War and it is understood he was called up when he was 17 on or after 18 October 1918. Whilst little is known of his military service, he maintained to his family he was sent to Belgium to bury the dead, which could well be true.\nDavid deferred his place at Christ's College, Cambridge because of his military service, but, once at Cambridge he became the first Socialist President of the Cambridge Union in 1924. His parents had been members of the Fabian Society and he was an active socialist.\nHe unsuccessfully contested Cambridge at the 1929 general election.\nAt the 1945 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Darlington, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Charles Peat.\nHardman held the seat until the 1951 general election, when he was defeated by the Conservative Fergus Graham. In the Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Education.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|David Hardman"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|David Hardman"]}, {"page": "Darlington (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| David Hardman"]}, {"page": "Attlee ministry", "response": ["|David Hardman||30 October 1945||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Labour Club", "response": ["Despite its exposed left flank CULC grew rapidly and became the largest student political society by the late 1920s. By 1924 there were around 100 paying members and in 1925 David Hardman was elected as the first ever socialist President of the Cambridge Union Society; two CULC members, A L Hutchinson and the future educationalist Lionel Elvin, would succeed him. CULC would play an important role in campaigning in the town. They participated in the campaigns for the parliamentary elections in 1922, 1923, and 1924. The last of those elections saw CULC make a special effort in the county Labour Party. But it was the selection of Hardman which truly motivated members. They began canvassing for Hardman in 1927 and organising socials with college workers and trade union gatherings for him. They were also entrusted to organise the entire campaign in Castle, a ward which covered most of the areas of the present-day Newnham and Castle wards.", "*David Hardman, first Labour President of the Cambridge Union in 1925, MP"]}, {"page": "Savile Club", "response": ["*David Hardman"]}, {"page": "Fergus Graham", "response": ["Graham returned to Parliament at the 1951 general election, when he was elected as MP for Darlington, defeating the sitting Labour MP David Hardman.
