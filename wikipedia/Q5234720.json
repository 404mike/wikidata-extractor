He grew up in Coleraine with his sisters Grace (b 1903?) and Alice (b 1913?). His brother Partick was born in 1915 (?) but grew up in Barrow-in-Furness in Lancashire.\nDavid Hardman's education was interrupted by the First World War and it is understood he was called up when he was 17 on or after 18 October 1918. Whilst little is known of his military service, he maintained to his family he was sent to Belgium to bury the dead, which could well be true.\nDavid deferred his place at Christ's College, Cambridge because of his military service, but, once at Cambridge he became the first Socialist President of the Cambridge Union in 1924. His parents had been members of the Fabian Society and he was an active socialist.\nHe unsuccessfully contested Cambridge at the 1929 general election.\nAt the 1945 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Darlington, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Charles Peat.\nHardman held the seat until the 1951 general election, when he was defeated by the Conservative Fergus Graham. In the Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Education.", "link_mentions": {}}}
