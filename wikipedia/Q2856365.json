These unauthorised trades caused the price of Brent Crude oil to rise by over $1.50 a barrel (equivalent to $1.81 in 2020) within a short period of time, a trend generally associated with major geopolitical events, before dropping rapidly. As a result of the trading, PVM Oil Futures suffered losses of almost $10 million and Perkins was dismissed, later being banned from trading by the Financial Services Authority (FSA).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rogue trader", "response": ["| Artificially increased the global price of Brent Crude Oil by $1.50 a barrel.
