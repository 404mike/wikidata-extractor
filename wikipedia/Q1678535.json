He opted instead to use a large piece of rock. While the film portrays the iconic scene of Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a \"river of shit\", Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. The production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and used chlorination to partially decontaminate it. Of the scene, Robbins said, \"when you're doing a film, you want to be a good soldier\u2014you don't want to be the one [who] gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety.\" The scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing Andy's escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing Andy standing triumphant in the water. Of his own work, Deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he \"over-lit\" it. In response, Darabont disagreed with Deakins' self-assessment. He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell."]}, {"page": "A Bridge Too Far (film)", "response": ["| Terence Marsh"]}, {"page": "Doctor Zhivago (film)", "response": ["| John Box, Terence Marsh and Dario Simoni"]}, {"page": "1987 in film", "response": ["| Spaceballs || Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer || Mel Brooks (director/screenplay); Ronny Graham, Thomas Meehan (screenplay); Mel Brooks, John Candy, Rick Moranis, Bill Pullman, Daphne Zuniga, George Wyner, Dick Van Patten, Joan Rivers, Michael Winslow, John Hurt, Sal Viscuso, Ronny Graham, Jim J.
