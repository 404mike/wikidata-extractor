Carter was the stage manager of the first British-Caribbean Carnival, held in St Pancras Town Hall, and later a Trustee of the Notting Hill Carnival Trust. His skills within the field of education led to the first Premier of British Guiana, Cheddi Jagan, personally inviting Carter to Guiana to perform educational work. Several historians of British socialist movements have described Carter as \"one of the Communist Party of Great Britain's (CPGB) most important black members\" from the mid-1950s until 1991. Carter was the cousin of fellow black civil rights leader and communist activist Claudia Jones, and the husband of EastEnders actress Corinne Skinner-Carter, all of whom played essential roles in establishing the second largest annual carnival in the world, London's Notting Hill Carnival. ", "In November 1955 Trevor Carter's cousin, the communist activist and black civil rights leader Claudia Jones arrived in Southampton, England, where she was greeted by Carter and his wife Corinne (then fianc\u00e9). Jones, who was also born in Trinidad and once served on the National Committee of the Communist Party USA, was imprisoned for her communist beliefs and her support for Black African-American civil rights and was deported to Britain under the McCarran Act. Carter, along with many other veteran Caribbean communist activists, admired Claudia for her understanding of racial and class issues. She quickly became very close with the couple, with Corinne Skinner-Carter regularly doing Jone's hair, and the three of them often collaborating with Caribbean cultural projects. On New Year's Eve 1955, Trevor Carter married Corinne Skinner Carter at Christ Church, Hampstead.", "In 1956, Carter was summoned by the British government to perform national service but did not want to take part in Britain's colonial wars, which were at the time happening in Malaya, Kenya, Ireland, Oman, and Cyprus. To help him avoid national service, leading British communist Palme Dutt arranged for Carter to instead travel to the Soviet Union and attend events in socialist countries. During his work for the CPGB and YCL, Carter travelled to Moscow, and also to Cuba where he met Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega. After hearing that his wife, the actress Corinne Skinner-Carter, had been badly burned on a film set, he returned to Britain to be with her. After returning to Britain to live with his wife, the couple moved to Hampstead.", "In the aftermath of the 1959 racist murder of Kelso Cochrane and the Notting Hill race riots, Trevor Carter, Corinne Skinner-Carter, and Claudia Jones were among a committee who sought to create a carnival to bring the London Caribbean community together. Their plans came to fruition on the 30th January 1959, and Carter worked as the stage manager of the first British-Caribbean Carnival, held in St Pancras Town Hall. This event would be the precursor to the Notting Hill Carnival, which would become the second-largest annual carnival in the world. Carter supported the Notting Hill Carnival for the remainder of his life, and also served as a Trustee of the Notting Hill Carnival Trust."]}]}}
