William Vernon Harcourt who was a scientist, and grandson of Edward Harcourt, Archbishop of York. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford.\nHarcourt was a J.P. for Berkshire and Sussex, and a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Oxfordshire and High Sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1875. He was Commanding Officer and later Honorary Colonel of the 1st Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers of the Royal Artillery. He was a member of Royal Commission for organizing the Volunteer Force in 1862, and was 15 years President of National Artillery Association.He was the author of Sketch of Madeira (1851) and Sporting in Algeria (1859).\nHe inherited Nuneham House and Park in 1871 and had a new Nuneham Courtenay parish church built in 1872\u201374.He served as Member of Parliament for Oxfordshire from 1878 to 1885 and for Henley from 1885 to 1886.Harcourt was married to Lady Susan Harriet Holroyd, daughter of 2nd Earl of Sheffield in 1849.\nHis brother was the politician William Vernon Harcourt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Vernon Harcourt"]}, {"page": "Henley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edward Vernon Harcourt"]}, {"page": "Madeira firecrest", "response": ["The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but frequently given family status, especially as recent research showed that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are taxonomically remote from the warblers. The names of the family, Regulidae, and its only genus, Regulus, are derived from the Latin regulus, a diminutive of rex, \"a king\", and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The species name madeirensis is derived from the island on which this bird is found. The Madeira firecrest was first described by English naturalist Edward Vernon Harcourt in 1851. Until recently, it was considered to be a subspecies, R. i. madeirensis, of the common firecrest R. ignicapillus. A phylogenetic analysis based on the cytochrome b gene showed that the Madeiran form is distinct at the species level from the firecrest nominate subspecies R. i. ignicapillus. Cytochrome b gene divergence between the Madeira firecrest and the European bird is 8.5%, comparable with the divergence level between other recognised Regulus species, such as the 9% between the goldcrest and the golden-crowned kinglet. The split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003, but some authorities, such as Clements, have not yet recognised the new species.  The International Ornithological Congress' recommended English name for this species was \"Madeiracrest\",Gill, F., and M.
