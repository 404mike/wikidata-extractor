He has released music under many names, of which most well known is his solo project, Prometheus, and his collaboration with Twisted Records label colleague, Simon Posford, under the moniker Younger Brother. His music is characterized by distinct basslines, high production quality, intense thematic development and unique or alternative approaches to the psytrance genre.  He frequently combines diatonic melodic content with metallic or \"glitchy\" percussive polyphonic elements to form thick contrapuntal tapestries of sound.  Although much of his music sounds like it was composed using equipment at the forefront of technology, it is not uncommon for him to use equipment now considered antique, such as the 1971 Korg micro synth that he used for portions of the second album, Corridor of Mirrors.\nBenjamin Vaughan founded a tech startup, called Disciple. Disciple is a community media platform that, unlike Facebook or a website, empowers community hosts to build, manage and control their own private, social apps. The platform gives communities their own mobile meeting spaces to gather and interact in the ways that work for them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vaughan (surname)", "response": ["*Benji Vaughan, British psychedelic trance and psybient musician"]}, {"page": "Hallucinogen (musician)", "response": ["He is also the founder of the label Twisted Records and works in the electronic groups Younger Brother and Shpongle.
