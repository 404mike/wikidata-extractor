Known as the \"Clown Prince of Soccer\", he is generally regarded as one of English football's finest ever entertainers. He also played cricket in the Minor Counties for Northumberland.\nAble to play at inside forward or outside forward, he scored 134 goals in 427 league and cup appearances in just over 11 seasons in the Football League, and before that scored 171 goals in league and cup 209 appearances during wartime football. His ball control skills made him one of the most talented players in the country, but his individualism and outspoken nature limited him to only five England caps in a six-year international career. He also never won a trophy or league title.\nBorn in Bradford, he spent his teenage years before World War II with Bradford Park Avenue, Kippax United, Arsenal, Enfield, and London Paper Mills, before he turned professional at Bradford Park Avenue in 1940. He spent the war assembling aircraft radios and playing for Bradford PA, and was sold on to Second Division rivals Newcastle United for a \u00a313,000 fee in October 1946. He scored six goals on his Newcastle debut, but fell out with the club's directors, and was sold on to Sunderland for a British transfer record fee of \u00a320,050 in February 1948. He scored 97 goals in 320 First Division matches for the club, with the closest he came to a trophy being the 1949\u201350 season when Sunderland finished third in the league, and when they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1955 and in 1956. He retired due to an ankle injury in 1957, and became a sports journalist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 3", "response": ["*1922 \u2013 Len Shackleton, English footballer and journalist (d. 2000)"]}, {"page": "November 27", "response": ["*  2000   \u2013 Len Shackleton, English footballer and journalist (b. 1922)"]}, {"page": "Northumberland", "response": ["There are many notable footballers from the county, pre Second World War and immediate post war greats were George Camsell and Hughie Gallacher, these were described in the \"Clown Prince of Football\" by Len Shackleton.

When he was a few months old, Robson's family moved to the nearby village of Langley Park where his father was a coal miner. Their two-bedroom house had no bath and an outside toilet.Wray Vamplew, 'Robson, Sir Robert William [Bobby] (1933\u20132009)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2013 accessed 18 February 2013 As a boy, he was often taken by his father to watch Newcastle United play at St James' Park on Saturday afternoons, requiring a 34-mile round trip. Robson described Jackie Milburn and Len Shackleton as his childhood heroes. Both played for Newcastle in the inside-forward position, the position Robson would later assume during his playing career."]}, {"page": "Sunderland A.F.C.", "response": ["For Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid \u00a318,000 (\u00a3 today) for Carlisle United's Ivor Broadis in January 1949. Broadis was also Carlisle's manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club. This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of Len Shackleton and the Welsh international Trevor Ford, led to a contemporary nickname, the \"Bank of England club\".Days, pp. 169\u2013170.

Newcastle player Len Shackleton remarked \"they were lucky to get nil\". Despite victories over Coventry City, Sheffield Wednesday and Fulham, the club needed four wins out of the last four games to have any hope of safety. Despite a revenge victory over Newcastle United, defeats to Birmingham City, Luton Town and Manchester City sealed their fate. County finished bottom of the Second Division and were relegated."]}, {"page": "Grange-over-Sands", "response": ["* Len Shackleton, footballer"]}]}}
