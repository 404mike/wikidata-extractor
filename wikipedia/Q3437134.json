He was also on the team that defeated France in Paris in January 1952. He played throughout the championship and against New Zealand in 1953-54 and the following season captained Ireland against both France and Wales. He was capped 11 times. He won the Ulster Senior League with Queen's University, the Ulster Senior Cup with Instonians, and also played for London Irish, and the Barbarians.\nHe was made captain of the 1955 British Lions tour to South Africa.

Then, with Lions skipper Robin Thompson injured ahead of the third Test in Pretoria, Morgan was made captain and duly inspired his team and controlled the game to ensure a 9\u20136 win that meant the series could not be lost. The South African newspapers dubbed him \"Morgan the Magnificent\" and the level to which his influence was thought key was reflected in the frenzy of coverage his injured ankle received as the fourth Test came around. Although he played, he was not fully fit and the Lions could not prevent the Springboks squaring the series. But his reputation was already made and the memory of that tour - still known in  South Africa as \"the Cliff Morgan tour\" - proved long-lived. His last game of first-class rugby was for the Barbarians on 28 May 1958 at the RFUEA Ground, Nairobi, versus East Africa."]}, {"page": "Instonians", "response": ["* Robin Thompson", "* Robin Thompson"]}]}}
