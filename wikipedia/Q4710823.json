In 1975, he negotiated a position for the SNP's Winnie Ewing in the British delegation to the European Parliament, where she became known as \"Madame Ecosse\".

At the time, the Labour government were reliant upon support from the SNP.  The motion was carried by one vote on 28 March and Callaghan immediately called the general election which brought the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher to power.  Callaghan described the actions of the SNP as \"turkeys voting for Christmas\". Henderson lost his seat to Conservative Albert McQuarrie in the 1979 general election by less than 600 votes, and only two MPs from the SNP remained in the new Parliament.", "He fought the new seat of Banff and Buchan, which had largely replaced Aberdeenshire East in the 1983 general election.
