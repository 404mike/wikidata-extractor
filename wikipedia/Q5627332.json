Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, with just under 3%, was more extreme than his cousin, and refused to sell at any price. He believed any offer at that stage of Sainsbury's recovery was likely to undervalue the business, and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments, saw no reason to sell, given that the current management, led by Justin King, could deliver the extra profit generated for the benefit of existing investors. He claimed the bid 'brought nothing to the business', and that high levels of debt would significantly weaken the company and its competitive position in the long term, which would have an adverse effect on Sainsbury's stakeholders. On 11 April, the CVC-led consortium abandoned its offer, stating that \"it became clear the consortium would be unable to make a proposal that would result in a successful offer.\"", "| Justin King", "In July 2013, chief executive Justin King announced plans to focus on expanding its convenience shops."]}, {"page": "Jamie Oliver", "response": ["He criticised Sainsbury's CEO Justin King when Oliver slammed the \"junk\" sold by supermarkets that ends up in the lunchboxes of millions of children.
