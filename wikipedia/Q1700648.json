One Andreas Swab, a Swedish metallurgist and Counsellor of the College of Mines is credited with the first use of the blowpipe for 'pyrognostic operations', of which no record remains.  The next person of eminence who used the blowpipe was Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who put it to the purpose of the discrimination of minerals by means of fusible reagents.John Joseph Griffin (1827) A Practical Treatise on the Use of the Blowpipe via Google Books  In 1770 an English translation of Cronstedt's work was made by Von Engestrom, annexed to which was a treatise on the blowpipe. Despite this opening, assay by blowpipe was for the time an occupation undertaken for the most part in Sweden. Bergman's use of the blowpipe outstripped all of his predecessors, and he widened its application from mineralogy to inorganic chemistry, giving rise to what may be regarded as a masterpiece of philosophical investigation, De Tubo Ferruminatorio, published in Vienna in 1779 (and translated into English in 1788). Bergman's assistant, Johan Gottlieb Gahn, is credited with improving the design and application of the blowpipe. Gahn travelled with a portable blowpipe, applying it to every kind of chemical and mineralogical enquiry, such as proving the presence of copper in the ashes of vegetables. Gahn published a Treatise on the Blowpipe, which was reprinted a number of times in contemporary chemistry textbooks. J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius worked with Gahn to ascertain in a systematic manner of the phenomena presented by different minerals when acted on by the blowpipe. He established, according to Griffin, the notion that the blowpipe was an instrument of indispensable utility, and his published work, later translated into English, was regarded as one of the most useful books on practical chemistry extant."]}, {"page": "Beaker (laboratory equipment)", "response": ["thumb|left|(A) A low-form or Griffin form beaker(B) A tall-form or Berzelius beaker(C) A flat beaker or crystallizerStandard or \"low-form\" (A) beakers typically have a height about 1.4 times the diameter.British Standard 6523 (1984) Glass beakers for original experiments use The common low form with a spout was devised by John Joseph Griffin and is therefore sometimes called a Griffin beaker.A.

These are sometimes called Berzelius beakers and are mostly used for titration. Flat beakers (C) are often called \"crystallizers\" because most are used to perform crystallization, but they are also often used as a vessel for use in hot-bath heating. These beakers usually do not have a flat scale."]}]}}
