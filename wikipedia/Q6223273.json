The industry contracted as fashion showed a preference for cottons and French silk. The workforce contracted to 5,000 in 1886. By the late nineteenth century, the United Kingdom was at a comparative disadvantage in silk manufacturing. Prominent silk families such as that of John Brocklehurst and John Birchenough were also active in civic and religious life. Most were keen non-conformists and built chapels for their workers. Silk paid for the education of the poor. Macclesfield Sunday School was founded in 1796 by non-conformists, and the large building that now houses the Heritage Centre was built in 1813\u20131815. Here 2,500 children each year received a formal education on their one-day off from work. The Anglicans built the National School on Duke Street as a response.
