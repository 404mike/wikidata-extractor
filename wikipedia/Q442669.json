Twelve years later, after Marcus Claudius Marcellus defeated and slew the Gallic king, Viridomarus, at the Battle of Clastidium, to win the spolia opima, he vowed a temple to Honos and Virtus.Livy, History of Rome, xxvii. 25, xxix. 11.  He renewed this vow after capturing Syracuse in 212 BC, during the Second Punic War, and while consul in 208 he attempted to fulfill it by rededicating the existing temple in the name of both gods.  The College of Pontiffs refused to allow this, so Marcellus restored the temple of Honos, and built a second, adjoining shrine to Virtus, making a double temple.Livy, History of Rome, xxvii. 25.Plutarch, \"The Life of Marcellus\", 28.Symmachus, Epistulae, i. 20.  Marcellus was slain in an ambush near Venusia later that year, so the temple was dedicated by his son in 205.Livy, History of Rome, xxv. 40, xxvii. 27, xxix. 11.  It was richly adorned with treasures that Marcellus had brought from Syracuse, although many of these disappeared over the next two centuries.Livy, History of Rome, xxv. 40.Cicero, De Republica, i. 21, In Verrem, iv. 121.Valerius Maximus, i. 1. \u00a7 8.
