Many of the excavation details have been lost, but detailed recording was undertaken of four barrows with the richest grave goods. They were named the King's Barrow, the Queen's Barrow, the Lady's Barrow and the Charioteer's Barrow by the excavators.

The western barrow was about  high, with a small ditch around it.  Near the top of the barrow Thurnam found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk,  deep and  across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about  high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.Thurnam (1860), pp. 326\u2013327.Cunnington (1912), p. 43."]}, {"page": "John Candler (abolitionist)", "response": ["He was then appointed Superintendent to The Retreat, a Quaker facility for therapeutic treatment for mental distress.
