The family name was Wisniewski but his father dropped the name after Beresford was born. Julius Beresford was also a rower who won an Olympic silver medal for Great Britain rowing at the 1912 Summer Olympics as well as winning several times at Henley. Jack was educated at Bedford School where he stroked the eight and also captained the rugby football XV. During the First World War he served in the Liverpool Scottish Regiment and was wounded in the leg in France. He returned to London and learned the craft of furniture-making for Beresford & Hicks in his father's factory. He took up sculling because the leg wound put an end to his rugby career. Throughout his competitive career, Beresford (like his father and his brother, Eric Beresford) represented Thames Rowing Club. Michael Beresford was his nephew who competed in rowing at the 1960 Olympics."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1960 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Michael Beresford"]}, {"page": "Julius Beresford", "response": ["Beresford's son Jack Beresford was also a rower and won medals at five successive Olympics.
