McLeod and Turnbull proved to be master-stroke signings and along with existing forwards Ralph McElhaney, E. Andrews and Joe Turner, the quintet fired Brentford to an unbeaten Southern League season. The Bees' 1st-place finish in the Second Division led to a test match at the end of the season versus Swindon Town, who had finished bottom of the First Division. With Brentford needing to win to secure promotion and with the score at 0\u20130, the match at Elm Park went into extra time and was called off after 107 minutes due to bad light."]}]}}
