He was raised in the nearby area of Purley, which he described as \"the epitome of middle-class suburbia\". He has a brother nine years his junior. He was privately educated at Whitgift School in Croydon, where his father was a swimming coach, before going on to study law and German at the University of Bristol. While there, he attended a hypnotist show by Martin S Taylor, which inspired him to turn to illusion and hypnosis as a career. As an undergraduate, he started working as a conjuror, performing the traditional skills of close-up magic in bars and restaurants. In 1992, he started performing stage shows at the University of Bristol under the stage name Darren V. Brown; the \"V\" stood for \"Victor\".", "In 2008, Brown made a brief cameo in the supernatural drama series Crooked House. An interview with Brown was featured in Richard Dawkins' 2009 two-part documentary series The Enemies of Reason. Brown explained various psychological techniques used by purported psychics and spiritual mediums to manipulate their audiences. The most notable was cold reading, a technique which he discusses extensively in his book Tricks of the Mind. Some video footage was also used from his TV special Messiah. As part of Channel 4's 3D season in 2009, Brown presented Derren Brown's 3D Magic Spectacular. The show was not a new special from Brown; instead, he was the presenter for a number of other magicians and clips that were shown. However, he did include one extract taken from a 2006 episode of Trick of the Mind in which he found an object that had been hidden in the streets of Venice by a volunteer.", "In January 2011, to celebrate 10 years since his first television appearance, Channel 4 held a special \"Derren Brown Night\". As well as re-showing The Heist (which had won a recent poll of favourite Brown specials) and one of his Enigma live shows, the channel screened a special documentary called Derren Brown: Behind the Mischief. It was a personal and candid film about Brown which included the story of how he met his co-writer (who was featured in Seance), his mother's feelings about his involvement in the Russian Roulette special, and an emotional visit back to his old school, university, and bars/pubs where he first began his career. Celebrity contributors included Matt Lucas, Jo Whiley, Stephen Merchant, and Simon Pegg. In January 2013, he was featured in a Channel 4 Deal or No Deal special, where he appeared to have predicted all the correct boxes to win the big jackpot of \u00a3250,000.

He also alleged he had received threats from sceptics and had to move home because of it. Ofcom rejected his complaint on the basis that Power had been fully apprised of the sceptical nature of the programme, and his actions had been presented fairly.", "Several authors have claimed that Brown uses neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) in his act which \"consists of a range of magical 'tricks', misdirection and, most intriguing, setting up audiences to provide the response that he wishes them to provide by using subtle subliminal cues in his conversation with them\".John Ozimek. Journal of Database marketing & Customer Strategy Management. London: Apr 2007. Vol. 14, Iss. 3; p. 161, 3 pages In response to the accusation that he unfairly claims to be using NLP whenever he performs, he wrote, \"The truth is I have never mentioned it outside of my book.\" He does have an off-stage curiosity about the system, and discusses it in the larger context of hypnotism and suggestion. In his book Tricks of the Mind, he mentions that he attended an NLP course with Richard Bandler, co-creator of NLP and mentor of Paul McKenna. He also describes the NLP concept of eye accessing cues as a technique of \"limited use\" in his book Pure Effect. The language patterns which he uses to suggest behaviours are very similar in style to those used by Richard Bandler and by the hypnotist from whom Bandler learnt his skill, Milton H. Erickson. Brown also mentions in Tricks of the Mind that NLP students were given a certificate after a four-day course, certifying them to practise NLP as a therapist. A year after Brown attended the class, he received a number of letters saying that he would receive another certificate, not for passing a test (as he discontinued practising NLP following the course), but for keeping in touch. After ignoring their request, he later received the new certificate for NLP in his mailbox, unsolicited.Derren Brown, Tricks of the Mind, Transworld Publishers, 2006,  Part Four: Hypnosis and Suggestibility, Section Neuro Linguistic Programming, Sub section: The eyes have it (some of the time)", "| Derren Brown Investigates", "| Derren Brown: Live", "| Derren Brown: Live", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: Inside Your Mind", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: The Specials", "| Collection of four of Derren Brown's one-off television specials: \"The Heist\", \"The System\", \"S\u00e9ance\" and \"Russian Roulette\"", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: An Evening Of Wonders", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: Enigma", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: Live Collection", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: The Experiments", "| Collection of four of Derren Brown's Experiments: \"The Assassin\", \"The Gameshow\", \"The Guilt Trip\" and \"The Secret of Luck\"", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: Svengali", "| scope=\"row\" | Derren Brown: Infamous", "International Magic Presents: The Derren Brown Lecture is an 80-minute lecture DVD of close-up mentalism and subsequent discussion of various aspects of Brown's performance.

In particular, the 1870s exposures of the Davenport Brothers as illusionists and the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission brought an end to the first historic phase of Spiritualism. Stage magicians like John Nevil Maskelyne and Harry Houdini made a side-line of exposing fraudulent mediums during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1976, M. Lamar Keene described deceptive techniques that he himself had used in s\u00e9ances; however, in the same book, Keene also stated that he still had a firm belief in God, life after death, ESP, and other psychic phenomena.
