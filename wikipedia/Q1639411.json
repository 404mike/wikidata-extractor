He started his career with his local side Stockport County, where he stayed for 10 years before moving to Liverpool in 2007. After spending two years at Liverpool, he left by mutual consent having made no first team appearances.\nCrowther went on several trials before joining Stalybridge Celtic in August 2010. He left the club in September, having been sentenced to four months in prison, for a drunken attack on a taxi driver in Watford. After his release from prison he joined Ashton United, where he stayed until the end of the 2010\u201311 season, before Hyde, and later Fleetwood Town. Following his release from Fleetwood, Crowther joined non-League side FC Halifax Town. At the end of the 2013\u201314 season he left Halifax Town after just 4 months at the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liverpool F.C.

Liverpool agreed a deal with Stockport for both players, subject to satisfactory performances at the tournament. After the tournament, Liverpool wished to sign both players, although Tansey declined Liverpool's contract offer as he stated he wished to develop playing first-team football, as opposed to playing in Liverpool's youth side on a weekly basis. He was also strongly linked with a move to Charlton Athletic, but eventually signed a new two-year deal with Stockport in August 2007. He made 16 appearances for the club during the 2007\u201308 season, before joining Conference National side Altrincham on loan in March 2008. This deal ran until the end of the season. He made his Altrincham debut in a 1\u20131 draw against promoting-chasing Torquay United a day after joining the club, and went on to make five appearances before returning to Stockport."]}, {"page": "Gianluca Havern", "response": ["On 6 September 2010 it was announced he had been signed by Mossley, but after just a month and only six appearances he moved to Tameside rivals Ashton United.
