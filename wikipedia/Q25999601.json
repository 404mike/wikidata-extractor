A YouGov poll for The Sunday Times had 48% of respondents saying May should resign, with 38% against. A Survation poll for  The Mail on Sunday showed a similar result. Former Cabinet minister Anna Soubry called for May to \"consider her position\" after the election result. Former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said that May could not lead the Conservative Party into the next general election, and called for a leadership election in the summer or in 2018 before the Brexit deal would be finalised. After the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017, May's leadership faced further criticism following her initial refusal to meet victims, and what was described as her poor handling of the crisis."]}, {"page": "Fiona McLeod Hill", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fiona Hill (British political adviser)"]}]}}
