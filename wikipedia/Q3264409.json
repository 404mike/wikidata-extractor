Varius Ambibulus, his sister's name is Varia, and his freedmen were Varii, Olli Salomies argues his original name was Lucius Varius Ambibulus, and the terms of a testamentary adoption one Quintus Planius Sardus directed Ambibulus to add his name to Ambibulus' in return for a share of the latter's estate.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), pp. 35f However, Werner Eck and Margaret Roxan present another possibility, based on a military diploma owned by Martin Sch\u00f8yen, that mentions an equestrian \"Q. Planius Sardus\", the commander of ala I Ulpia contrariorum milliaria. Noting the nomen gentile \"is otherwise rare in the senatorial and equestrian classes\", they argue that Ambibulus is related to this equestrian, adding the \"Quintus Planius Sardus\" element in his name from his mother's side.Eck and Roxan, \"Two New Military Diplomas\", in R\u00f6mische Inschriften \u2013 Neufunde, Neulesungen und Neuinterpretationen, Festschrift f\u00fcr Hans Lieb, hg.
