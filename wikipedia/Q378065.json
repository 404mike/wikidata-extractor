In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.", "Niobium was identified by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He found a new element in a mineral sample that had been sent to England from Connecticut, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of John Winthrop the Younger) and named the mineral columbite and the new element columbium after Columbia, the poetical name for the United States. The columbium discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum."]}, {"page": "Tantalum", "response": ["Tantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg, in two mineral samples \u2013 one from Sweden and the other from Finland. One year earlier, Charles Hatchett had discovered columbium (now niobium), and in 1809 the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared its oxide, columbite with a density of 5.918\u00a0g/cm3, to that of tantalum, tantalite with a density of 7.935\u00a0g/cm3. He concluded that the two oxides, despite their difference in measured density, were identical and kept the name tantalum. After Friedrich W\u00f6hler confirmed these results, it was thought that columbium and tantalum were the same element. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample, and he named them after the children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe, the goddess of tears), and pelopium (from Pelops). The supposed element \"pelopium\" was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium, and it was found that the niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett."]}, {"page": "1765", "response": ["* February 1 \u2013 Charles Hatchett, English chemist (d. 1847)"]}, {"page": "1847", "response": ["* October 3 \u2013 Charles Hatchett, English chemist (b. 1765)"]}, {"page": "List of chemists", "response": ["*Charles Hatchett (1765\u20131847), English chemist who discovered niobium"]}, {"page": "Columbite", "response": ["In 1801 Charles Hatchett discovered the element niobium in this specimen,"]}, {"page": "Upton, Slough", "response": ["Upton's Norman Church, St Laurence's Church, is around 900 years old.

Minutes 1 and 2 of the extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution on 23 December 1820, chaired by vice-president Charles Hatchett which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on 5 November 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small hole in the wall of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of 20 December, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson\u2019s Journal.
