A defender, Cherry also played for Huddersfield Town and Bradford City, and managed the latter club.\nBorn in Huddersfield, he started his career at his hometown team before he made his name at Leeds United during the 1970s, making 486 appearances and winning the Championship title in 1973\u201374. He won a total of 27 international caps and captained the England team on one occasion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 23", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Trevor Cherry, English footballer (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "2020", "response": ["**Trevor Cherry, English footballer (b. 1948)"]}, {"page": "Huddersfield", "response": ["Notable ex-players include Scottish international Denis Law, Ray Wilson, a World Cup winner with England in 1966 and Trevor Cherry, England international."]}, {"page": "Bradford City A.F.C.", "response": ["The club was founded in 1903 and immediately elected into the Football League Second Division. Promotion to the top tier followed as they won the 1907\u201308 Second Division title and then they went on to win the 1911 FA Cup Final, which remains the club's only major honour. They were relegated in 1922 and again in 1927, before winning the Third Division North title in 1928\u201329. Another relegation in 1937 did allow the club to go on to win the Third Division North Cup in 1939, however a further relegation followed in 1962 to leave the club in the newly created Fourth Division. They secured promotions back into the third tier in 1969 and 1977, but were relegated in 1972 and 1978. They found success in the 1980s under the stewardship of first Roy McFarland and then Trevor Cherry, winning promotion in 1981\u201382 and following this up with the Third Division title in 1984\u201385, though they were relegated out of the Second Division in 1990.", "City failed to win promotion for three successive seasons, until the board appointed former England centre back Roy McFarland as manager in May 1981. McFarland won promotion in his first season, but was poached by his former club Derby County just six months later. City won compensation from Derby and installed another England international Trevor Cherry as McFarland's replacement. Cherry, with former teammate Terry Yorath as his assistant manager, failed to win for two months, but eventually the pair guided City to safety from relegation. During the summer, however, the club chairman Bob Martin had to call in the official receivers. The club was saved by former chairman Stafford Heginbotham and former board member Jack Tordoff, but to ensure the club could start the new season, prize asset, striker Bobby Campbell was sold to Derby. City struggled but so did Campbell, and when he returned, the club went on a record run of ten successive victories. Although they missed out on promotion, City won the league the following season 1984\u201385, to return to the second tier of The Football League. However, City's triumph was overshadowed by the fire disaster, which killed 56\u00a0people when Valley Parade caught fire in the final game of the season.", "*  Trevor Cherry", "*  Trevor Cherry (1982\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["Looking for a successor to Jack Charlton, early in the 1972\u201373 season he signed Gordon McQueen from St Mirren for \u00a330,000. He also spent \u00a3100,000 on defender Trevor Cherry and \u00a335,000 on centre-half Roy Ellam, both from Huddersfield Town, and started playing young Scottish forward Joe Jordan more regularly. Leeds again came close to a Treble, but their league title campaign tailed off and they finished third, some seven points behind champions Liverpool. They did reach the 1973 FA Cup Final to face Second Division Sunderland, but despite manager turned pundit Brian Clough's remark that \"there is no way Sunderland can beat Leeds\", United lost 1\u20130. Leeds also reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup against Italian club A.C. Milan at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium, where they were beaten 1\u20130 following some controversial refereeing from Christos Michas which eventually saw Norman Hunter sent-off after he reacted badly to being consistently fouled by pushing Gianni Rivera to the ground. In 2009, Yorkshire and the Humber MEP Richard Corbett unsuccessfully petitioned the European Parliament to reverse the result of the match over allegations that Michas accepted a bribe from the Italian side."]}, {"page": "Bradford City stadium fire", "response": ["The Bradford City matchday squad of players and staff consisted of Terry Yorath, Trevor Cherry, Chris Withe, Don Goodman, Eric McManus, Tony Clegg, John Hawley, Dave Evans, Bryan Edwards, John Hendrie, Mark Ellis, Stuart McCall, Peter Jackson, Bobby Campbell, Martin Singleton and Greg Abbott."]}, {"page": "David Harvey (footballer)", "response": ["Harvey played 6 league games for Bradford City in 1985.

The departure of Revie for the England job in 1974 and the emergence over the next season of Frank Gray, younger brother of Eddie, as well as the continued presence of Trevor Cherry (who Revie had bought as a central defender in 1972 but had ended up filling in at left back), rendered Cooper surplus to requirements. He left the club in 1975 to join Middlesbrough who were managed by former Leeds teammate Charlton."]}, {"page": "Frank Gray", "response": ["He did not stay in the side, with a reshuffled defence allowing Trevor Cherry to take the left back spot for the end of the season which consisted of two cup finals (the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup) both of which Leeds lost. Revie did invite Gray to travel with the squad to Wembley and he sat next to his manager during the defeat to Sunderland."]}, {"page": "Paul Madeley", "response": ["Revie signed Trevor Cherry as a replacement for Cooper in the summer of 1972, and Madeley moved across to the centre of defence for much of the next season as Jack Charlton's distinguished career at Leeds wound down.

Milan in controversial circumstances."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Montgomery", "response": ["Montgomery featured for Sunderland in the 1973 FA Cup Final, where they beat Leeds United 1\u20130 to win the FA Cup for only the second time in their history. His most memorable contribution in that match was a double save from Trevor Cherry and Peter Lorimer which prevented Leeds from equalising. This was described in an internet article in 2012 as the greatest double save ever."]}]}}
