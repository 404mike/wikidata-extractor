The painting shows a man, manacled, on a stone bench and looking pensively or plaintively upward.  Its subject matter, historical period, and mode of creation suggest the artist intended the painting as an abolitionist statement. After going on display again in the 1828, the painting was not given another public showing for 180 years until being purchased by the Art Institute of Chicago in 2008.", "The artist, John Simpson, was a British portrait painter who studied at the Royal Academies, and was a longtime assistant of the portraitist Thomas Lawrence. Simpson has been described in modern scholarship as being not well known.  The painting was created on a used canvas that x-rays showed had previously depicted a stately home and another portrait; this reuse suggests that Simpson did not paint it on commission, which is how he made his living, but here he appears to have chosen the subject of his own volition. The portrait was displayed in London at the Royal Academy not once but twice, in 1827 and again in 1828; it was also displayed at an exhibition at the Liverpool Academy in 1828.  Several contemporary reviews at that time noted the pathos that the painting evoked, and associated the painting with \"radical\" or \"sentimental\" abolitionist literature."]}, {"page": "John Philip Simpson", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Simpson (artist)"]}, {"page": "John Simpson (painter)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Simpson (artist)"]}]}}
