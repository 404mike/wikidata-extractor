When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, German war crimes, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, Allied war crimes, and deaths due to war-related famine and disease.", "| style=\"text-align: left;\" | || 15,490,000Gregory Frumkin.

The name \"Poland\" was banned. Polish monuments were torn down. All institutions of the dismantled Polish state, including the Lw\u00f3w University, were closed, then reopened, mostly with new Russian directors. Soviet Communist ideology became paramount in all teaching. Polish literature and language studies were dissolved by the Soviet authorities, and the Polish language was replaced with Russian or Ukrainian. Polish-language books were burned even in primary schools. Polish teachers were not allowed in the schools, and many were arrested. Classes were held in Belorussian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian, with a new pro-Soviet curriculum. As Polish-Canadian historian Piotr Wr\u00f3bel noted, citing British historians M. R. D. Foot and I. C. B. Dear, majority of scholars believe that \"In the Soviet occupation zone, conditions were only marginally less harsh than under the Germans.\" In September 1939, many Polish Jews had fled east; after some months of living under Soviet rule, some of them wanted to return to the German zone of occupied Poland."]}, {"page": "German casualties in World War II", "response": ["Estimated figures for German World War II casualties are divergent and contradictory.
