He taught at Cheltenham College of Art and was Head of Art at Newport College of Art between 1922 and 1940. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, Royal West of England Academy, Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and the Paris Salon. He painted landscapes which display the effects of light and colour on the landscape, often working out of doors. As well as painting the area close to his home in the West of England, he also produced numerous views of Polperro in Cornwall, which he and his wife visited regularly. In his 50s he developed Parkinson's disease, which hampered his ability to paint and he died in 1949.", "link_mentions": {}}}
