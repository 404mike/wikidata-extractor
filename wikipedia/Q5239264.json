Results were often inconsistent meaning automatic promotion was not possible and Stoke made it into the play-offs. They faced Walsall who, after a 0\u20130 draw in the first leg, beat Stoke 4\u20132, meaning that Stoke faced a fourth season in the third tier. The pressure was on Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n to gain automatic promotion in 2001\u201302 and he tried a different approach. He sold both Graham Kavanagh and Peter Thorne to Cardiff City for a combined fee of \u00a32.7 million and with that money he brought in defender Peter Handyside from Grimsby Town who was made captain, goalkeeper Neil Cutler, Belarusian defender Sergei Shtanyuk, Belgian midfielder Jurgen Vandeurzen, David Rowson from Aberdeen and most impressively former Dutch international Peter Hoekstra. Stoke were again lacking the consistency for automatic promotion and for the third season running they entered the play-offs. The opponents this time were Cardiff and it looked like being another failure as the Bluebirds won the 1st leg at Stoke 2\u20131. Stoke went into the second leg at the notoriously hostile Ninian Park 2\u20131 down and with both sides missing chances the match was 0\u20130 after 90 minutes and in the final minute of injury time James O'Connor scored to send the match into extra time. And Stoke scored again via an O'Connor shot which deflected in off Souleymane Oular\u00e9 to give Stoke the most dramatic victory. The final against Brentford was not as dramatic, as Stoke won comfortably 2\u20130 thanks to goals from Deon Burton and an own goal from Ben Burgess. However, despite finally achieving promotion via the play-offs at the third attempt Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n's contract was not renewed."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["During the 2007\u201308 season, Partick Thistle participated in the Scottish First Division and finished the season in 6th place.
