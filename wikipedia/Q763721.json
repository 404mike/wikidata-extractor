That year, for the first time since the First World War, Wales retained the same side for two consecutive matches when they faced England and Scotland.Smith (1980), p. 262. Then, in 1933, captained by Watcyn Thomas, Wales defeated England at Twickenham.Richards (2006), p. 135 In 1935, Wales beat the touring New Zealand side 13\u201312, with Haydn Tanner making his first appearance.

The South Africans were rampant in Wales, winning the test match and all six club matches, though gained few supporters due to the kicking tactics Osler employed.  The New Zealander's received a better welcome, and after the previous tour where the tourist went unbeaten the Welsh press were hoping for a return of the spirit that won the first encounter in 1905. Before the match with Wales, New Zealand were to face eight club teams over six games. After winning the opening three English county matches and then beating a joint Abertillery and Cross Keys the All Blacks were showing the same form shown in their first two tours, but then stumbled against Swansea. Swansea were not in a period of particular growth and the only two players showing any flair were Wales Schoolboy players Willie Davies and Haydn Tanner. During the game Merv Corner could not contain the attacking bursts from Tanner, the New Zealand flankers were drawn in which in turned allowed Davies the freedom to run which Claude Davey finished off with two tries. Jack Manchester's response to the Swansea win was to ask the New Zealand press \"Tell them we have been beaten, but don't tell them it was by a pair of schoolboys\". This win gave Swansea the honour of being the first club team to have beaten all three major Southern Hemisphere touring teams. The All Blacks were unbeaten in the next twenty matches, but lost to Wales in a classic game which Wales managed to win in the last ten minutes of the game after the Welsh hooker, Don Tarr, was stretchered off with a broken neck."]}, {"page": "Bleddyn Williams", "response": ["Williams made his debut for Wales in January 1947 against  as a fly-half, playing alongside Haydn Tanner.

The club had a fantastic record against Newport during these years, going 15 games unbeaten against them between 1946 and 1950. Cardiff players helped Wales win their first Grand Slam in nearly forty years in 1950, and later that year supplied five players to the Lions for the first time later that year.

Haydn Tanner is one of the club's most famous players, playing for Wales and the British Lions in 1938.
