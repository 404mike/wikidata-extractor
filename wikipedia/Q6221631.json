Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of Bristol City striker Andy Cole in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of Charlton Athletic's Rob Lee bolstered the midfield in the autumn."]}, {"page": "Allan Clarke (footballer)", "response": ["Clarke had another spell at Barnsley between 1 July 1985 and 8 November 1989. Despite having no money to spend, low gates, and being forced to sell players such as David Hirst and John Beresford, Clarke led Barnsley to the fifth round of the FA Cup twice, when they were knocked out by Arsenal in 1987 and Everton in 1989. At the end of 1988\u201389 season, Barnsley finished just two points off securing a play-off place, losing only twice in the last 17 games. However, in the following season Barnsley played poorly and with the club third from bottom in the Second Division, he was sacked. Clarke was Lincoln City manager for six months but he was sacked on 30 November 1990 to be replaced by Steve Thompson. After a few months scouting for Derby County, Clarke has not been employed in football since."]}, {"page": "Barry Venison", "response": ["Venison made his debut of the Magpies on 15 August 1992 in the 3\u20132 league win over Southend United at St James' Park, Venison enjoyed a tremendous beginning to his Newcastle career as they won their first eleven league games in a row, leaving them runaway leaders of Division One and looking uncatchable in the promotion race by October. The run came to an end when they lost to a last minute goal at home against Grimsby Town; they fell just 2 games short of the record 13 straight victories that had been set seven years earlier by Reading in the old Third Division. Keegan got his team to play in an exciting, attacking way with them becoming a talking point within the game for their exuberant style of play along with their mean defence which included a revitalised Venison as well as the likes of John Beresford and Steve Howey. Newcastle went on to become Division One champions, winning the title with a 2\u20130 away win, coincidentally at Grimsby, thus gaining promotion to the Premier League."]}, {"page": "Wayne Bridge", "response": ["Bridge made his first-team debut on 16 August 1998 (the opening day of the 1998\u201399 season) coming on as a replacement for John Beresford, who had badly damaged his knee. Bridge made his first senior start in the next match on 22 August in a 5\u20130 defeat away to Charlton Athletic. As Southampton struggled to pick up points (with only two points after the first nine games), Bridge played (on the left wing) in most of Saints' league games until early December before losing his place to Hassan Kachloul. For the remainder of the 1998\u201399 Premier League season, Bridge was only used occasionally as Saints narrowly avoided relegation.

He gained his A-licence, which allowed him to coach in the professional game, and he took up coaching at Ossett Town. He and John Beresford then set up an unsuccessful wooden flooring company called 'Major Oaks'. The pair then developed a football training product called 'BallMax', Alex Ferguson used it in the Manchester United Academy, but this business also went nowhere. Billy Jennings then took the pair on as football agents at Premier Management International for a twelve-month period. Northampton Town manager Martin Wilkinson then took Swan on as a coach, but soon after Colin Calderwood took over as manager in 2003 Swan found himself again out of work. Swan instead found success in the building trade, constructing a house in his expansive back garden. He also found work as an 'expert witness' for Hull City's games at BBC Radio Humberside in 2003.

The club stayed up on the last day of the season, with a 2\u20131 win over Leicester City. As the Premier League had been established, the Second Division was renamed the First Division, and Newcastle won the league, eight points ahead of West Ham United. The defence was strengthened by the signings of John Beresford and Barry Venison, and in February 1993, the strike force was bolstered by the arrival of Andy Cole, who scored twelve goals in his first twelve games for the club. In the summer of 1993, top scorer David Kelly was moved on, and Beardsley returned to the club, having spent the previous two seasons at Everton. Gavin Peacock also left the club, he was replaced by Rob Lee, who had joined in the autumn transfer window.
