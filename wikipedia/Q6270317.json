During his time at Leicester, he was loaned out to Notts County and Oxford United to gain first-team experience. He joined Oxford on a permanent basis in September 2003 and played 103 matches for the club over three league seasons, before being released in May 2006. Ashton signed for Rushden & Diamonds ahead of the 2006\u201307 season, spending one season there before joining Essex club Grays Athletic on a free transfer in May 2007. He spent one-and-a-half years with Grays, during which he earned four caps for the England C team.\nAshton signed for fellow Conference Premier club Stevenage Borough for an undisclosed fee in January 2009.

Ashton left Stevenage in the summer of 2015 and joined Crawley Town of League Two. He then signed for National League club Braintree Town in July 2016, before returning to Grays Athletic on loan. Having initially joined Grays permanently ahead of the 2017\u201318 season, Ashton was offered a player-assistant manager contract at hometown club Nuneaton Town, which he signed in August 2017.

He captained the team in their 2\u20130 victory against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough on 17 April 2010; the match that secured promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. Roberts played 49 times during the season, scoring five times from defence. He was also named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for April 2010. During the season, Roberts formed a centre-back partnership with Jon Ashton, with Stevenage having the best defensive record in the league, conceding 24 goals in 46 league matches. The team ended the season having not conceded in their last six games; and conceded two goals in their last 15 league matches. In May 2010, Roberts signed a new two-year contract with Stevenage. On signing the new deal, Roberts said \"there was never any doubt that I wanted to stay here, I love the club and love the fans. It will be a privilege to lead the team in the Football League\". At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named in the Team of the Year, alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Ronnie Henry and Scott Laird.", "In the summer of 2012, Stevenage stated that they had rejected several bids for Roberts, along with fellow Stevenage centre-back Jon Ashton, from League One club Doncaster Rovers. He captained the team in Stevenage's first game of the 2012\u201313 season, scoring the third goal in a 3\u20131 victory against AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup on 14 August 2012. Two days after the game, Stevenage released a statement announcing they would not be selling Roberts during the season. Roberts scored his first league goal of the season in Stevenage's 4\u20131 defeat to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, scoring an equaliser just before half-time, heading in Filipe Morais's corner. In February 2013, Roberts was one of three players shortlisted by the Football League for the Player in the Community award as a result of his work in the local community over the past few years. The club stated \u2013 \"we are extremely proud that Mark has been shortlisted for this award, he is a credit to the football club and his day to day work and support of the community scheme and the club's community work is due worthy recognition\". Following the departure of manager Gary Smith in March 2013, Roberts was again appointed as caretaker manager while the club searched for a new manager. He managed the team for Stevenage's televised away match against Tranmere Rovers, which ended in a 3\u20131 defeat on 24 March 2013. In Stevenage's next match, on 29 March 2013, Roberts scored a first-half header in a 1\u20131 away draw with Crawley Town, briefly giving Stevenage the lead with the team having to play with 10 men for most of the match following Miguel Comminges' early red card. In what was his last match in caretaker charge, Roberts stated he was \"proud of the phenomenal performance\", and that \"the attitude, the way the lads reacted to the adversity we faced was probably something I haven't seen all season, to that level anyway\". A day later, Graham Westley was re-appointed as Stevenage manager, who brought Roberts to the club in 2008, and as a result Roberts was able to concentrate solely on his playing role. He played 48 times during the season, scoring four goals.

Westley brought in former player, Dino Maamria as first-team coach at the club. This, coupled with signings during the season, such as Chris Day, Mark Roberts, and Jon Ashton, meant that Stevenage improved during the second half of the season.
