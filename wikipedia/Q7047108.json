After initially struggling to find suitable musicians, in January 2011, Corbin met Ashley Hayden who would go on to become the band's bass player but not before the band recorded the E.P Just the Kind of People with British soul singer/producer Noel McKoy, who helped expand their sound deep into more soul territory. McKoy recruited well-known London musicians Ernie McKone (bass), Carl Hudson (keys), Paul Jordanous (trumpet) and Tom White (trombone) to play on the four tracks. At Corbin's request McKoy phoned two former students, Carmella Davis and Louie-Ann Miller, to sing backing vocals on the record. The two would go on to join the band full-time along with lead guitarist Harry Ainsworth, who was shortly replaced by Billy Farr. By this time Ollie Futcher had already replaced Rooster Robertson on drums and the line-up was beginning to solidify.Ashie, Richard. New Street Adventure: On Your Marks, Blues & Soul (Issue 1045).
