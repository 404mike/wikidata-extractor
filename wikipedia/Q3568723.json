It has long vexed Birmingham antiquaries and is perhaps insoluble. HuttonHistory of Birmingham, William Hutton, 1781, p. 142 gave the course as \"onwards by Stirchley Street, crossing the Bromsgrove road at Selly Oak, leaving Harborne a mile to the west, by the observatory in Lady Wood Lane, crossing the Dudley Road at Sandpits, and along Worstone Lane, passing five furlongs north of the Navigation Bridge in Great Charles Street, Birmingham. He saw the section of the road where the inhabitants attempted to pull it up for the sake of the materials, 20 yards wide, and one yard deep, filled up with stone cemented with coarse mortar,\" and he says that \"the course was discoverable by its barren track through uncultivated meadows.\" Icknield Street or Icknield Port Road are not old names and cannot be traced in the city prior to 1825 and may have been introduced as a result of Hutton's theory. Birmingham and its suburbs now cover the old road. The line of Hazelwell Street sets the course of the road towards the next established point of the route at Metchley Fort in the grounds of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The fort was established about 48\u00a0AD by the Roman army as a base camp for its conquest of the Birmingham areaVictor Skipp, The History of Greater Birmingham - down to 1830, 1980.  and part of a network of forts across the Midlands linked by roads.Birmingham's Roman Fort Main Findings It stood by Birmingham's earliest known road junction at the point where Icknield Street was met by Roman roads coming in from Droitwich and Penkridge. From here the road runs north to another fort at Wall, Roman Etocetum near Lichfield. The Perry Bridge of 1711 stands at its crossing of the River Tame in Perry Barr. However, Walker cast doubts on this orthodox view of the road's course in this areaWalker, B, 1936 The Rycknield Street in the Neighbourhood of Birmingham Trans Birmingham & Warwickshire Archaeol Soc 60, 42-55 and resistivity surveys undertaken on sites either side of the crossing in 1992, showed that, although the line of the road is clearly indicated on old maps and aerial photographs, the site has been considerably altered this century by, among other things, the embankment of the M6. The one place where the road might have been detected proved inaccessible without considerable clearance of dense undergrowth (remnants of a hedge-line following the road?) and a 20-metre grid on adjacent open ground proved negative. The second site was on wasteland immediately south of the river. Here, the \"Walker\" road-line only shaved the top comer of this before disappearing under a modern industrial development (plot-holders in allotments to the south did not recall any finds during building work, nor were they able to identify any \"hard\" areas on their land, where the \"Walker\" line might be expected to continue). A series of complete and partial 20-metre grids laid down the fence line between the industrial estate and the wasteland and then right across the open area yielded nothing which could relate to the \"Walker\" line but did produce some low resistance features running parallel with the site's east boundary.Holford , Birmingham Roman Roads Project, University of Birmingham, Accessed 27 May 2011\"West Midlands Archaeology\" issue 40, 1997, page 102"]}, {"page": "Sutton Coldfield", "response": ["In his History of Birmingham, published in 1782, William Hutton describes the presence of three mounds adjacent to Chester Road on the extremities of Sutton Coldfield (although now outside the modern boundaries of the town). The site, southwest of Bourne Pool (named \"Bowen Pool\" by Hutton), is called Loaches Banks and was mapped as early as 1752 by Dr. Wilks of Willenhall. Hutton interpreted the earthworks as a Saxon fortification but further archaeological work led Dr. Mike Hodder, now the Planning Archaeologist for Birmingham City Council, to believe that the site was an Iron Age hill-slope enclosure. Centuries of agriculture on the land has severely affected the visibility of the features, with the earthworks now only apparent in aerial photography.", "Following his trial and three-year suspension from preaching, the violently anti-Presbyterian Henry Sacheverell retired to New Hall, the home of his once-removed first cousin, George Sacheverell. Henry Sacheverell preached a vitriolic sermon at Sutton Church on Sunday 17 October 1714, which fuelled Birmingham's contribution to the nationwide rioting the following Wednesday, the day of King George I's coronation.  It also appears that, whilst residing in New Hall, he helped ferment the anti-Presbyterian \"Church in danger\" riots of July 1715, when, according to a correspondent of George Berkeley, up to 4000 rioters gathered in Birmingham, twenty-eight rioters died, and no more than three Dissenters\u2019 meeting-houses survived in Birmingham, Worcestershire and Staffordshire.Gilmour, Ian; Riot, risings and revolution (London, 1992); .  The town became a temporary refuge in 1791, following the \"Priestley Riots\" in Birmingham. William Hutton, for example, whose house was attacked by protesters, decided to spend the summer in Sutton. However, local residents' fears of further rioting forced him to move permanently to Tamworth. Joseph Priestley is said to have stayed at the 'Three Tuns' following the destruction of his home in the riots, and his initial flight to Heath-forge, Wombourne."]}, {"page": "History of Birmingham", "response": ["Rather than low wages, efficiency and scale, Birmingham's manufacturing growth was fuelled by a highly skilled workforce, specialisation, flexibility and, above all, innovation.;  The low barriers to entry to the Birmingham trades gave the town a high degree of social mobility and a distinctly entrepreneurial economy; the contemporary William Hutton described trades that \"spring up with the expedition of a blade of grass, and, like that, wither in the summer\". In terms of manufacturing technology Birmingham was by far the most inventive town of the era: between 1760 and 1850 Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other town or city.;  Despite the landmark inventions of engineers such as James Watt, most of these developments are better characterised as part of a continuous flow of small-scale technological improvements.;  Matthew Boulton remarked in 1770 how \"by the many mechanical contrivances and extensive apparatus wh we are possess'd of, our men are enabled to do from twice to ten times the work that can be done without the help of such contrivances\". Innovation also took place in production processes, particularly in the development of an extreme division of labour.;  Contemporary sources noted that in Birmingham even simple products such as buttons would pass through between fifty and seventy different processes, performed by a similar number of different workers. The resulting competitive advantage was noticed by Lunar Society member Richard Lovell Edgeworth when he visited Paris, observing that \"each artisan in Paris\u00a0... must in his time 'play many parts', and among these many to which he is incompetent\", concluding that \"even supposing French artisans to be of equal ability and industry with English competitors, they are left at least a century behind\".", "Georgian Birmingham was marked by the dramatic growth of the vigorous public sphere for the exchange of ideas that was the hallmark of enlightenment society. Most characteristic was the development of clubs, taverns and coffeehouses as places for free association, cooperation and debate, often crossing lines of social class and status. Although the exceptional historic influence of the Lunar Society of Birmingham has made it much the best-known, the contemporary William Hutton described hundreds of such associations in Birmingham with thousands of members, and the German visitor Philipp Nemnich commented late in the century that \"the inhabitants of Birmingham are fonder of associations in clubs than almost any other place I know\". Particularly notable examples included Freeth's Coffee House, one of the most celebrated meeting places of Georgian England; Ketley's Building Society, the world's first building society, founded at the Golden Cross in Snow Hill in 1775; the Birmingham Book Club, whose radical politics saw it nicknamed the \"Jacobin Club\", and which alongside other debating societies such as the Birmingham Free Debating Society and the Amicable Debating Society played a prominent role in the growing expression of popular political consciousness within the town; and the more conservative Birmingham Bean Club, a dining club uniting leading loyalist figures in the town with prominent landowners from the surrounding counties, which played a prominent role in the emergence of a distinct \"Birmingham interest\" in regional politics from 1774."]}, {"page": "The Ballad of Chevy Chase", "response": ["William Hutton, in A Journey from Birmingham to London (1785), mentions \"the old song of Chevy Chace\" and its tale about \"the animosity between England and Scotland\"."]}, {"page": "Ambion Hill", "response": ["Ambion Hill was long considered to be the site of the Battle of Bosworth Field and is where the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre is situated.

By the early 1600s the area had already developed a reputation as one where the traditional power of the aristocracy and the established church was weak,;  becoming a haven for incomers who did not fit in with established thinking elsewhere: religious non-conformists, scientific and literary free-thinkers, industrial entrepreneurs and political dissenters. The Midlands Enlightenment that followed in the 18th century saw the town's growth into an important centre of  literary, musical, theatrical and artistic activity, and the emergence of an unusually tolerant, secular society, characterised by \"unfussy conviviality ... lack of dogmatism ... and a  sponge-like ability to absorb new ideas\". This openness and cultural pluralism was further encouraged by the town's broad-based and entrepreneurial economic structure. The \"city of a thousand trades\" was made up of a wide variety of highly skilled specialists operating in small workshops, producing a constantly diversifying range of products in response to changing market conditions and collaborating in a shifting, fragmented web of overlapping and informal groupings. The result was the development of a culture that valued variety, adaptability and change more than uniformity and continuity; whose need for cooperation and trust bred an innate suspicion of boastfulness and pretension; and which was characterised by the remarkable capacity for \"accommodating difference\" that has been an enduring theme of the city's history. The historian William Hutton, noting the diversity of Birmingham's culture as early as 1782, remarked that \"the wonder consists in finding such agreement in such variety\". Over two centuries later in 2008 the philosopher Sadie Plant could still describe \"the city's unique, almost declass\u00e9 mixture of individualism and co-operation\"."]}, {"page": "John Lombe", "response": ["The Italians had been using power spinning since the early 15th century,Calladine, Anthony (1993). \"Lombe's Mill: An Exercise in reconstruction\".
