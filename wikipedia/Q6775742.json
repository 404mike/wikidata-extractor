Andreas BlassAndreas R. Blass was the first to point out connections between game semantics and linear logic. This line was further developed by Samson Abramsky, Radhakrishnan Jagadeesan, Pasquale Malacaria and independently Martin Hyland and Luke Ong, who placed special emphasis on compositionality, i.e. the definition of strategies inductively on the syntax. Using game semantics, the authors mentioned above have solved the long-standing problem of defining a fully abstract model for the programming language PCF. Consequently, game semantics has led to fully abstract semantic models for a variety of programming languages, and to new semantic-directed methods of software verification by software model checking."]}, {"page": "Categorical logic", "response": [";Internal languages: This can be seen as a formalization and generalization of proof by diagram chasing. One defines a suitable internal language naming relevant constituents of a category, and then applies categorical semantics to turn assertions in a logic over the internal language into corresponding categorical statements. This has been most successful in the theory of toposes, where the internal language of a topos together with the semantics of intuitionistic higher-order logic in a topos enables one to reason about the objects and morphisms of a topos \"as if they were sets and functions\". This has been successful in dealing with toposes that have \"sets\" with properties incompatible with classical logic. A prime example is Dana Scott's model of untyped lambda calculus in terms of objects that retract onto their own function space. Another is the Moggi\u2013Hyland model of system F by an internal full subcategory of the effective topos of Martin Hyland."]}, {"page": "Hyland", "response": ["*Martin Hyland, British mathematician"]}, {"page": "Logics for computability", "response": ["Kleene's original realizability interpretation has received much attention among those who study connections between computability and logic.
