In December 1991 he was sent on a short loan spell at Third Division side West Bromwich Albion to gain some more experience. He impressed on his Albion debut, which came in a 1\u20131 draw away at Bradford City on 14 December. In only his second appearance for the club, he was sent off for violent conduct in the draw with Exeter City when he was involved in a clash of heads with referee Paul Alcock. Despite video evidence showing that the \"butting\" was accidental he was still found guilty by The Football Association and received a nine match ban and a \u00a3600 fine. He remained at The Hawthorns and went on to make a total of six appearances for the \"Baggies\", scoring once before returning to Chelsea in March 1992.

But they performed reasonably well throughout the season, being one of just three sides to beat treble winners Manchester United in addition to being one of just four sides to beat second-placed Arsenal, who would finish just one point behind Manchester United. Up to 27 February 1999 \u2013 their 3\u20131 home win over Middlesbrough \u2013 they were boasting somewhat inconsistent yet very stable, promising mid-table form: 10th in the table, winning ten, drawing five and losing 11 of their first 26 games with an impressive goal difference of +9 and were looking like good bets for a UEFA Cup slot. However, they couldn't quite keep up the momentum and would lose their next five games which ultimately ended such hopes. However, winning three of their final seven matches ensured that they would finish 12th at the end of a campaign during which they had never faced any serious threat of relegation; a significant improvement to the previous season. The only major concern at the club was a growing mountain of debts which would have been even more of a worry had the Owls suffered relegation. An expensively assembled squad including Paolo Di Canio, Benito Carbone and Wim Jonk failed to live up to the massive wage bill the club was paying and things eventually came to a head when Italian firebrand Di Canio was sent off in a match against Arsenal and infamously proceeded to push the referee Paul Alcock on his way off, which resulted in an extended ban of 11 matches and him being fined \u00a310,000."]}, {"page": "1995 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["The match, refereed by Paul Alcock, was played in front of 22,814 spectators.
