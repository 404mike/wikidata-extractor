After finishing his football career, he took up speedway. He rode alongside his brother Fred for the Newcastle team in the 1929 English Dirt Track League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1929 Speedway English Dirt Track League", "response": ["| Walter Creasor"]}, {"page": "List of Darlington F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["Numerous players left Darlington to seek opportunities with other teams. Reg Mountford played for ten years in the First Division for Huddersfield Town, appeared in the 1938 FA Cup Final, and managed the Denmark national team that won the bronze medal at the 1948 Olympics. Ray Wood went on to win two League titles with Manchester United and play for England; he survived the Munich air crash, played another 300 times in the League and managed at both club and international level abroad. The careers of others were winding down: Aston Villa's European Cup-winner Allan Evans's single appearance for Darlington was his last of an 18-year senior career. Others were to make an impression in different sporting fields. Graham Doggart, who played twice for Darlington in 1921\u201322, became an administrator both in cricket, as a committee member of Sussex CCC and of the MCC, and in football, as chairman of the Football Association. Walter Creasor was a speedway rider in the early days of the sport in Britain."]}, {"page": "Tommy Winship", "response": ["He began the 1924\u201325 season in the reserves, Walter Creasor being preferred at outside left, but soon returned to first-team duties. In their first defeat of the season, away to Rochdale in mid-September, the Athletic News reported that \"Winship was the pick of the Darlington forwards, and several of his early centres should have been turned to good account\", and two weeks later he produced a \"swinging shot which curled into the net\" to open the scoring at home to Bradford. Darlington soon established a lead at the top of the division which they were to hold for the rest of the season, despite their team containing numerous \"real old stagers\", players who were well known before the war. Winship himself was still \"nippy\", despite his veteran status, though not as quick as the outside-right Mark Hooper."]}, {"page": "Walter Cuthbert Creasor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Walter Creasor"]}]}}
