He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1982 along with Sune Bergstr\u00f6m and Bengt Samuelsson for \"their discoveries concerning prostaglandins and related biologically active substances\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aspirin", "response": ["Aspirin's popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases. The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and US federal law, and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women."]}, {"page": "ACE inhibitor", "response": ["Leonard T. Skeggs and his colleagues (including Norman Shumway) discovered ACE in plasma in 1956. It was also noted that those who worked in banana plantations in South-western Brazil collapsed after being bitten by a pit viper, leading to a search for a blood pressure lowering component in its venom. Brazilian scientist S\u00e9rgio Henrique Ferreira reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of Bothrops jararaca, a South American pit viper, in 1965. Ferreira then went to John Vane's laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow with his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, Kevin K. F. Ng and John R. Vane showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in vivo. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation."]}, {"page": "March 29", "response": ["*  1927   \u2013 John Vane, English pharmacologist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 2004)"]}, {"page": "November 19", "response": ["*  2004   \u2013 John Vane, English pharmacologist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug", "response": ["Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. This inhibition is competitively reversible (albeit at varying degrees of reversibility), as opposed to the mechanism of aspirin, which is irreversible inhibition. COX catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. This mechanism of action was elucidated in 1970 by John Vane (1927\u20132004), who received a Nobel Prize for his work (see Mechanism of action of aspirin)."]}, {"page": "1927", "response": ["* March 29 \u2013 John Vane, British pharmacologist, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 2004)"]}, {"page": "2004", "response": ["* November 19 \u2013 John Vane, British pharmacologist and Nobel laureate (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Keston", "response": ["Its most famous past resident is former prime minister Margaret Thatcher who with her late husband Denis raised their children, Mark and Carol.
