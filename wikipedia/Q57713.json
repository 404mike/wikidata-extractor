Nazi leaders often visited the Wagner festival and tried to turn Bayreuth into a Nazi model town. It was one of several places in which town planning was administered directly from Berlin, due to Hitler's special interest in the town and in the festival.

In July 1925 Adolf Hitler attended a performance of Parsifal in Bayreuth as a guest of Winifred Wagner. According to Walpole, who was sitting in Wagner's box next to Hitler, as Melchior sang, \"the tears poured down Hitler's cheeks\". On February 17, 1926, his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City took place. He sang Tannh\u00e4user opposite Maria Jeritza, Friedrich Schorr, Karin Branzell, and Michael Bohnen with Artur Bodanzky conducting. Although he was not adversely criticized, there was not much enthusiasm elicited by this debut. In his first season at the Metropolitan opera, Melchior sang only eight times. His second season brought only one appearance. To build up his repertory and gain more stage experience, he accepted an engagement at the Hamburg State Opera, where he appeared as Lohengrin, Otello, Radames in Aida and Jean van Leyden in Le proph\u00e8te.

This performance was broadcast throughout Europe and in the Americas, and was used as part of a propaganda effort intended to portray the \"New Germany\" as the triumphant inheritor of the German musical tradition rather than a break from the past, to which Furtw\u00e4ngler's place at the podium was instrumental.

This clear attack on Hitler caused a sharp reaction: Hitler wanted to drop Furtw\u00e4ngler from Bayreuth after all.
