On 2 September when under constant fire in Dammartin, France, he extricated a sergeant who was lying under his dead horse, and carried him to safety. The next day, when another sergeant had lost his horse in a similar way, Corporal Garforth drew off the enemy fire and enabled the sergeant to get away.He was taken prisoner in October 1914 and was repatriated in November 1918. He later achieved the rank of sergeant. His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London.\nUpon his death, Garforth was cremated, and no monument or headstone was laid, as he technically had no grave. This was rectified on 30 August 2008, when a headstone was dedicated to him at Wilford Hill Cemetery in Nottingham, where his ashes were originally scattered.", "link_mentions": {}}}
