On 2 September when under constant fire in Dammartin, France, he extricated a sergeant who was lying under his dead horse, and carried him to safety. The next day, when another sergeant had lost his horse in a similar way, Corporal Garforth drew off the enemy fire and enabled the sergeant to get away.He was taken prisoner in October 1914 and was repatriated in November 1918. He later achieved the rank of sergeant. His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London.\nUpon his death, Garforth was cremated, and no monument or headstone was laid, as he technically had no grave. This was rectified on 30 August 2008, when a headstone was dedicated to him at Wilford Hill Cemetery in Nottingham, where his ashes were originally scattered.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Charles Ernest Garforth || British Army || 1914 || First World War || Harmignies"]}, {"page": "Charles Garforth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Ernest Garforth"]}, {"page": "1973 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 1 July \u2013 Charles Ernest Garforth, English soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross (born 1891)"]}, {"page": "15th The King's Hussars", "response": ["thumb|Charles Ernest Garforth  V.C.", "* Charles Ernest Garforth, Corporal, First World War 23 August 1914"]}, {"page": "List of people from Nottingham", "response": ["*(1891\u20131973) Charles Ernest Garforth, awarded the Victoria Cross for valour at Harmingnies, France, in the First World War in 1914, died in Beeston and was cremated at Wilford Hill, Nottingham."]}, {"page": "Garforth (name)", "response": ["*Charles Ernest Garforth (1891\u20131973), Recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Charles Ernest Garforth VC", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Ernest Garforth"]}]}}
