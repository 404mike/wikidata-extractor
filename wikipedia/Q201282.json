Governor Gore Browne succeeded in bringing 3500 Imperial troops from the Australian colonies to quash this perceived challenge, and within four years a total of 9,000 British troops had arrived in New Zealand, assisted by more than 4,000 colonial and k\u016bpapa (pro-government M\u0101ori) fighters as the government sought a decisive victory over the \"rebel\" M\u0101ori."]}, {"page": "Flagstaff War", "response": ["It is clear that both the British and their allies, as well as H\u014dne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti, found the prospect of peace attractive, as the war took a considerable toll on both sides. Far from being a one-sided victory, in a military sense the Flagstaff War can be considered an inconclusive stalemate, as both sides wished the war to end, both gained somewhat from the fighting, and the situation more or less remained the same as it was before the outbreak of hostilities. The political legacy of the rebellion by Kawiti and Heke was that during the time of Governor Grey and Governor Thomas Gore Browne, the colonial administrators were obliged to take account of the opinions of the Ng\u0101puhi before taking action in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands. The Waitangi Tribunal in The Te Roroa Report 1992 (Wai 38) state that \"[a]fter the war in the north, government policy was to place a buffer zone of European settlement between Ngapuhi and Auckland.\"The Te Roroa Report 1992 (Wai 38), Waitangi Tribunal (1992) Chapter 1, Section 1.1. p. 8"]}, {"page": "First Taranaki War", "response": ["In its 1996 report to the Government on Taranaki land claims, the Waitangi Tribunal observed that the war was begun by the Government, which had been the aggressor and unlawful in its actions in launching an attack by its armed forces. An opinion sought by the tribunal from a senior constitutional lawyer stated that the Governor, Thomas Gore Browne, and certain officers were liable for criminal and civil charges for their actions. The term \"First Taranaki War\" is opposed by some historians, who refer only to the Taranaki Wars, rejecting suggestions that post-1861 conflict was a second war.James Belich, in \"The New Zealand Wars\" (1986) dismisses as \"inappropriate\" the description of later conflict as a second Taranaki war (pp. 120). The 1927 Royal Commission on Confiscated Land also referred to the hostilities between 1864 and 1866 as a continuation of the initial Taranaki war."]}, {"page": "Second Taranaki War", "response": ["In 1861 Governor Thomas Gore Browne had promised to investigate the legitimacy of the sale of the Waitara land, but as delays continued, Taranaki and Ng\u0101ti Ruanui M\u0101ori became increasingly impatient. During the earlier war they had driven settlers off farmland at Omata and Tataraimaka, 20\u00a0km south of New Plymouth, and occupied it, claiming it by right of conquest and vowing to hold it until the Waitara land was returned to them.J. E. Gorse, The Maori King, chapter 9, 1959. On 12 March 1863, 300 men from the 57th Regiment, led by Colonel Sir Henry James Warre, marched out to Omata to retake the land and a month later, on 4 April, Browne's successor, Governor Sir George Grey, marched to Tataraimaka with troops and built a redoubt and re-occupied the land in what the Waitangi Tribunal described as a hostile act. The five tribes encamped in the area \u2013 Atiawa, Taranaki, Ngatiruanui, Nga Rauru and Whanganui \u2013 promptly requested assistance from Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto and Waikato M\u0101ori to respond to what they regarded as an act of war."]}, {"page": "Invasion of the Waikato", "response": ["The First Taranaki War had ended in March 1861 as an uneasy truce between the government and M\u0101ori forces, with both sides recognising they had reached a stalemate. The lack of a clear victory by imperial forces led Governor Thomas Gore Browne to turn his attention to the Waikato, the centre of the Kingite movement, where king T\u0101whiao was attracting the allegiance of increasing numbers of M\u0101ori across the North Island. Browne concluded that members of the Kingite movement would have to be compelled to submit to British rule. After attempting to achieve a peace settlement through \"kingmaker\" Wiremu Tamihana, in mid-1861 he sent an ultimatum to the movement's leaders, demanding submission to Queen Victoria and the return of plunder taken from Taranaki; when it was rejected he began drawing up plans to invade the Waikato and depose the king\u2014a plan opposed by both the Colonial Office and the New Zealand General Assembly. According to Browne, in response to his belligerence, Kingite leaders formed plans to launch a raid on Auckland on 1 September and burn the town and slaughter most of its residents. This has since been dismissed by such historians as James Belich as being fear-mongering from Browne in order to try and gain military support."]}, {"page": "Gore, New Zealand", "response": ["As crossing the Mataura River involved a long fording, the locality became known as \"the Long Ford\", or Longford. In 1862 a few town sections were surveyed on the west bank of the river and Longford was named Gore as a compliment to Sir Thomas Gore Browne, an early Governor of New Zealand.

Due to the Otago gold rush, the region's population grew during the 1860s with the settlement of Bluff.Wright (2009), p. 148 Browne agreed to the petition and gave the name Invercargill to the settlement north of the port. Inver comes from the Scottish Gaelic word inbhir meaning a river's mouth and Cargill is in honour of Captain William Cargill, who was at the time the Superintendent of Otago, of which Southland was then a part.Wright (2009), p. 224 The settlement's chief surveyor was John Turnbull Thomson, a British civil engineer."]}, {"page": "George Grey", "response": ["Grey was again appointed Governor in 1861, to replace Governor Thomas Gore Browne, serving until 1868.

The war had broken out the previous year over disputed land sales between local M\u0101ori and settlers in the Taranaki region. Cameron's appointment was at the behest of the War Office which was dissatisfied with the performance of the incumbent, Major-General Thomas Pratt, whose conduct of the fighting in the Taranaki had been the subject of much criticism. Receiving a temporary promotion to lieutenant-general, Cameron arrived in New Zealand in March 1861 and proceeded to the town of New Plymouth where he informed Pratt that he was being replaced. Although Cameron was keen to deal with the M\u0101ori threat in Taranaki, the Governor of New Zealand, Sir Thomas Gore Browne, had negotiated a truce to end the war."]}, {"page": "Edward Gibbon Wakefield", "response": ["Wakefield held two election meetings for his constituents in the Hutt Valley, which were well received.

He blamed Stafford's administration, along with Governor Thomas Gore Browne, for the wars in Taranaki, which broke out when a M\u0101ori chief refused to sell his land. Fox was widely believed to have converted to support of the M\u0101ori, although many modern historians claim that his opposition to land seizure was due to a pragmatic wish to avoid war, not a change of philosophy. Lack of evidence makes it difficult to tell which was the case."]}, {"page": "Wiremu K\u012bngi", "response": ["In 1859 a minor tribal chief, Teira, who was feuding with K\u012bngi, made an offer of some land directly to Governor Thomas Gore Browne.

Thomas Gore Browne, disdainful of the chaotic nature of the Sewell and Fox premierships, did not believe that parliament should have control over such an important matter, while Stafford pursued his old goal of democratic self-government. Stafford, on behalf of the new government, refused all responsibility for financing actions undertaken by the governor without parliament's approval."]}, {"page": "Julius von Haast", "response": ["Haast was fluent in English and, in 1858, was contracted by a British shipping firm, A.

He arrived in Auckland on 21 December 1858 and, the following day, met the Austrian Ferdinand von Hochstetter at the home of a German emigrant.
