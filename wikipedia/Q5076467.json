He scored 24 and 0, but the game was more notable for George Alfred Wilson's 7-71 (including a hat-trick) in the first innings. Corden's next match was not until May 1901, but in that he made 51 not out against Cambridge University. The county were nevertheless defeated by seven wickets.\nAgain he had to wait until the next season for another chance, but in 1902 he played 13 times, and in May hit a career-best 64 against Sussex. However, he only once passed 30 in his subsequent 17 innings that year, and a season's tally of 340 runs at 15.45 was disappointing, and after two more games in 1903, Corden was seen no more; he had failed to reach double figures in his final nine innings.\nCorden died in the town of his birth at the age of 49.", "link_mentions": {}}}
