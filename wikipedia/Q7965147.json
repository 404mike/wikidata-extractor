In a proclamation translated by Chinese consul and interpreter Walter Hillier, the Emperor stated:This Proclamation, therefore, is for the information of you merchants, traders, soldiers and people of every district. You must know that the 'Eagle Trade Dollar' that has lately come to Hong Kong has been jointly assayed by officers specially appointed for the purpose, and it can be taken in payment of duties, and come into general circulation. You must not look upon it with suspicion. At the same time rogues, sharpers, and the like, are hereby strictly forbidden to fabricate spurious imitations of this new Eagle Dollar, with a view to their own profit.  And should they dare to set this prohibition at defiance, and fabricate false coin, they shall, upon discovery, most assuredly be arrested and punished. Let every one obey with trembling! Let there be no disobedience!Evans, p. 53."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to North Korea", "response": ["*1889\u20131896: Walter HillierAddison, Henry Robert.
