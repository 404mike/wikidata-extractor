Hart-Davis further claims that success was finally achieved by an adviser to the mercenaries, the MP Neil \"Billy\" McLean, who privately (without the British government's knowledge) flew to Tel Aviv to meet Moshe Dayan, defense minister, and Meir Amit, head of Mossad.Hart-Davis, 2012. Chapter 6: Manna from Heaven. page 138. According to \"Haaretz\" newspaper, Tony BoyleTony Boyle had been a pilot in the Royal Air Force, then Aide-de-Camp to the Governor of Aden. He had never been in the SAS, pace Haaretz. (Hart-Davis, 2012. page xvi) contacted David Karon, the head of the Middle East department in the Tevel (Cosmos) section of the Mossad, and met with IAF commander Ezer Weizman and his officers. It was decided that the airdrops would be made. Haaretz suggested the crew of the airdrops were British; while according to Hart-Davis the crew were Israeli (including the pilot named Arieh Oz), with Tony Boyle on board as an observer.Hart-Davis, 2012. Chapter 6: Manna from Heaven. page 147. Three decades after the war, former Mossad director, Shabtai Shavit, and Ariel Sharon both said Israel had been clandestinely involved in Yemen, though both remained vague concerning the nature and scale of the involvement. The airlifts were originally codenamed Operation Gravy, but were later renamed Operation Porcupine. The IAF's largest transport plane, a Stratofreighter, was recruited for the British operation. According to Jones, what is clear however is that some of the mercenary air drops to the royalists (code-named \"Mango\") were organized by the British using an aircraft, which were contracted privately from IAF to the British mercenary operation and were either using Israeli air bases or Israeli transport planes themselves making the drops.Jones, C.
