One of his most characteristic and well known designs was that for the Police Stations which were built throughout Northern Ireland in the years following the creation in 1921 of Northern Ireland, following the Partition of Ireland. This 'partition' left Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, while the rest of Ireland became the Irish Free State.", "link_mentions": {}}}
