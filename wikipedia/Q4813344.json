Active in the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England and a member of the Alcuin Club, he energised the development of The English Hymnal (1906) and was chairman of its editorial board.  His best-known hymn is \"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\". He also created an English adaption of the eucharistic hymn \"O Esca Viatorum\".\n\nRiley's London house, at 2 Kensington Court, contained an altarpiece by Ninian Comper, a major designer of Anglo-Catholic church furnishings. He held the advowson of St Peter ad Vincula, Coveney, Cambridgeshire from 1883 and furnished the church.\nIn later life he moved to Jersey in the Channel Islands, where he purchased Trinity Manor in 1909, thereby acquiring the feudal title of Seigneur de La Trinit\u00e9. Finding the manor house in a ruined condition, he undertook an elaborate restoration (or \"imaginative reconstruction\", which has been criticised as turning the building into a French-style ch\u00e2teau). The reconstruction was carried out 1910\u20131913 by C. Messervy to designs by Sir Reginald Blomfield. Riley also bought the historic property L'Anciennet\u00e9 in Saint Br\u00e9lade, and removed architectural features of interest to incorporate into Trinity Manor, carefully recording the provenance of items and nature of alterations made in his project. He remained in Jersey through the German occupation, and died shortly after its liberation.", "link_mentions": {}}}
