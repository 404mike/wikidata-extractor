Tatakes also argues that, having understood this national consciousness, Photios emerged as a defender of the Greek nation and its spiritual independence in his debates with the Western Church.. Adrian Fortescue regards him as \"one of the most wonderful men of all the middle ages\", and stresses that \"had [he] not given his name to the great schism, he would always be remembered as the greatest scholar of his time\". Yet, Fortescue is equally adamant of his condemnation of Photios' involvement in the Schism: \"And yet the other side of his character is no less evident. His insatiable ambition, his determination to obtain and keep the patriarchal see, led him to the extreme of dishonesty. His claim was worthless. That Ignatius was the rightful patriarch as long as he lived, and Photius an intruder, cannot be denied by any one who does not conceive the Church as merely the slave of a civil government.
