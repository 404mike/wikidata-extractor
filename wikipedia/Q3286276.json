This lectotype appeared to be two sheets (621.1 and 621.2) in the Linnean Herbarium, not being part of a single gathering, and hence ICBN Art. 9.15 (Vienna Code) did not apply.ICBN Vienna Code Art. 9.15; What this means is that the first authors who designated a lectotype do not have to be followed because their lectotype was not part of a single gathering. In 1993 Mohammed Nabil El Hadidi designated 'Clifford Herbarium 206, Peganum no. 1', stored at the British Museum of Natural History, as the lectotype for P. harmala.El Hadidi, M.N.
