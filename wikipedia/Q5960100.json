While in Philadelphia, Brant also met with the French diplomat Pierre August Adet where he stated: \"[H]e would offer his services to the French Minister Adet, and march his Mohawks to assist in effecting a revolution and overturning the British government in the province.\"  When Brant returned home to Canada, there were fears of a French attack. Peter Russell wrote: \"the present alarming aspect of affairs\u00a0\u2013 when we are threatened with an invasion by the French and Spaniards from the Mississippi, and the information we have received of emissaries being dispersed among the Indian tribes to incite them to take up the hatchet against the King's subjects.\"  He also wrote that Brant \"only seeks a feasible excuse for joining the French, should they invade this province\". London ordered Russell to prohibit the Indians from alienating their land. With the prospects of war to appease Brant, Russell confirmed Brant's land sales.

Brant's conduct on this occasion which it deserves\"."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the United States", "response": ["*1796\u20131800: Sir Robert Liston"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1714\u20131820)", "response": ["*Robert Liston (1742\u20131836)"]}, {"page": "Levant Company", "response": ["* 1794\u20131795 Robert Liston", "* 1812\u20131820 Robert Liston"]}, {"page": "Robert Liston", "response": ["Robert Liston FRS (28 October 1794 \u2013 7 December 1847) was a pioneering British surgeon.
