By 1870, the group under Congreve was based at Chapel Street Hall in London. The barrister Frederic Harrison, who had met Congreve at Wadham College, Oxford, was a founding member, but he found it difficult to adhere to Congreve's rigid Comtism. In 1878 the group suffered a schism. That summer, Congreve dissolved the Society, for he wished to make sure everyone involved in the group advocated Auguste Comte's Religion of Humanity. He had founded the 'Church of Humanity' in January 1859 and was dissatisfied with the reluctance of the society to support his cause. In 1878, the Society's members published a range of attacks on one another, including Congreve's Circular Addressed to all my Coreligionists, to all the Disciples of Auguste Comte; E.S. Beesly's Remarks on Dr Congreve's Circular; and John Henry Bridges' Appeal to English Positivists. Beesly, Bridges, Harrison, and Vernon Lushington, among others, carried on as the London Positivist Society, expanding the group's membership to 93 members by 1891. In 1881, London Positivist Society boasted a new home at Fleur-de-lis Court, off Fetter Lane, Fleet Street, London. It was called Newton Hall after Sir Isaac Newton, who had first acquired it for the Royal Society Museum. Newton Hall became a popular Positivist center distinct from Congreve's Chapel Street Hall 'Church of Humanity' for the years to come. In 1883, the Newton Hall group formed a choir for positivist ceremonies, and they appointed Henry Holmes to compose a cantata of George Eliot's poem, 'The Choir Invisible' for these purposes."]}, {"page": "Edward Spencer Beesly", "response": ["In 1849 Beesly entered Wadham College, Oxford, another evangelical stronghold and the original centre of the English positivist movement.
