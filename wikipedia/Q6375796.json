According to Johanna Oksala, Foucault's influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists have with the help of Foucault's ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies: through plastic surgery, diet, eating disorders, etc. Foucault's historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as Judith Butler, who used Foucault's theories about the relation between subject, power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no \"true\" gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However, Butler is critical of Foucault. She argues Foucault \"naively\" presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power, without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjects/bodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists, such as Susan Bordo and Kate Soper."]}, {"page": "London Metropolitan University", "response": ["*Kate Soper, philosopher"]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1940\u20131999||data-sort-value=\"Soper, Kate\"|Kate Soper||United Kingdom||1943||\u2013||||"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* Kate Soper"]}, {"page": "Franz Jakubowski", "response": ["History has not been kind to Jakubowski.

Cohen has observed, \"if you want to be an ecocritic, be prepared to explain what you do and be criticized, if not satirized.\" Certainly, Cohen adds his voice to such critique, noting that one of the problems of ecocriticism has been what he calls its \"praise-song school\" of criticism. All ecocritics share an environmentalist motivation of some sort, but whereas the majority are 'nature endorsing',Kate Soper, \"What is Nature?\", 1998 some are 'nature sceptical'. In part this entails a shared sense of the ways in which 'nature' has been used to legitimize gender, sexual and racial norms (so homosexuality has been seen as 'unnatural', for example), but it also involves scepticism about the uses to which 'ecological' language is put in ecocriticism; it can also involve a critique of the ways cultural norms of nature and the environment contribute to environmental degradation. Greg Garrard has dubbed 'pastoral ecology' the notion that nature undisturbed is balanced and harmonious,Barry 2009, pp. 56-58 while Dana Phillips has criticised the literary quality and scientific accuracy of nature writing in The Truth of Ecology. Similarly, there has been a call to recognize the place of the environmental justice movement in redefining ecocritical discourse.Buell 1998"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Kate Soper (born 1943)"]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Kate Soper"]}, {"page": "Virginia Nimarkoh", "response": ["In 2008, Nimarkoh curated the research project Edge of a Dream: Utopia, Landscape & Contemporary Photography, which explored utopian depictions of landscape within recent art photography in the context of global capitalism, funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council, with support from Camberwell College of Arts, Goldsmiths University of London and Hand Eye Projects.
