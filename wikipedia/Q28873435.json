His father was a wine merchant and Williams followed him into the profession. He is first recorded as having played cricket for a Kent professional Colts side in 1863 and, despite making little impression in Colts cricket, played in three First XI matches for the county side in 1865. On his debut, against Sussex at Gravesend he scored 13 not out and took three wickets. These were his best figures for the side. His other matches came during the same season, both played against Yorkshire.It is possible that Williams played for the Gentlemen of Kent amateur side in 1867, although as a professional colt this is considered doubtful. At the 1871 census he was living in Ashford but was unemployed. There is no record of him after this, although CricInfo's database records his death occurred in January 1914 at Lyminge in Kent aged 69. This is no recorded in other sources and it is possible he may have emigrated.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Williams (disambiguation)", "response": ["Alfred Williams (born 1968) is a retired American football player.", "Alfred Williams may also refer to:", "*Alfred Williams (poet) (1877\u20131930), British poet", "*Alfred Williams (cricketer) (1844\u2013?), English cricketer"]}]}}
