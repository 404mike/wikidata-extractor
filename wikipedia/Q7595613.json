Although his father, grandfather, godfather, uncle and brother-in-law were admirals, and he was named after a naval battle, Cotton decided to join the army. After a brief career as a cavalry officer, he devoted the rest of his life to sport and gambling. He drove a London to Brighton stagecoach at one time, and was also a deputy lieutenant, militia captain, and magistrate for Cambridgeshire. Cotton married on his deathbed, and the baronetcy became extinct when he died.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir St Vincent Cotton, 6th Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT St Vincent Cotton"]}, {"page": "John Antrobus (cricketer)", "response": ["Antrobus' second and final first-class fixture came in 1832 in a match for Lord Strathavon's XI against Sir St Vincent Cotton's XI, in which he scored a duck in the first innings and was absent hurt in the second.John Antrobus at Cricket Archive"]}, {"page": "St Cotton", "response": ["#Redirect St Vincent Cotton"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|St Vincent Cotton", "|St Vincent Cotton, CricketArchive.
