A left-sided winger, he scored 47 goals in 249 league games in a 14-year career in the English Football League. He also won five senior caps for Wales in 1961.\nHe began his career with Wrexham and Oswestry Town, before moving to Everton via Bradford City in 1956. After three years on Merseyside he returned to Wales to play for Swansea Town. He returned to hometown club Wrexham in 1963, before joining Wellington Town in 1965. The next year he returned to the Football League with Tranmere Rovers. He helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1966\u201367, before he signed with Port Vale in July 1968. He joined Northern Premier League side Runcorn in May 1969, and later turned out for Oswestry Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["The club were a poor outfit Fourth Division when he took charge, and to boost the squad he signed 'tenacious' wing-half John King and Wales international winger Graham Williams from Tranmere Rovers, as well as Walsall's teenage Bobby Gough. With goalkeeper Stuart Sharratt out injured, he brought in Geoff Hickson on loan from Crewe Alexandra. Despite inconsistent results, fans threw their support behind Lee after witnessing consistent improvements in the Vale's performances. He solved his goalkeeping problems by signing Keith Ball from Walsall for 'a small fee', and his side put together a five-game unbeaten run in November. He adopted a more 'hit and run' style in March, and his side ended the campaign in 13th place with 46 points from their 46 games, scoring 46 and conceding 46 goals.", "In preparation for the 1969\u201370 campaign he released Mick Cullerton, Mick Mahon, Jimmy Goodfellow, Graham Williams, and Milija Aleksic; whilst top-scorer Roy Chapman rejected a new contract and signed with Chester City. Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\"."]}, {"page": "Graham George Williams", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graham Williams (footballer, born 1936)"]}, {"page": "Graham Williams", "response": ["Graham Williams may refer to:", "*Graham Williams (Australian cricketer) (1911\u20131978), Australian cricketer and prisoner of war", "*Graham Williams (footballer, born 1936) (1936\u20132018), Welsh international footballer who played for nine teams in England and Wales", "*Graham Williams (footballer, born 1938), Welsh international footballer who played for West Bromwich Albion and managed Weymouth and Cardiff City", "*Graham Williams (rugby league) (1944\u20131994), English rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s and 1970s, and coached in the 1980s", "*Graham Williams (rugby union) (1945\u20132018), New Zealand rugby union footballer", "*Graham Williams (English cricketer) (born 1985), English cricketer", "*Graham Williams (television producer) (1945\u20131990), British television producer and script editor", "*Graham Williams (promoter) (born 1978), concert promoter based in Austin, Texas, USA"]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On 8 June, the club's future was decided, as a vote of 39 to 9 allowed the club readmission to the Football League, despite the conclusion of an investigation earlier in the year which ruled that the club should be expelled from the League.
