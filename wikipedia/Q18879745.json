He was a Justice of the High Court from 1901 until his sudden death in 1910.\nBorn in a Catholic family in Liverpool, Walton's progress at the bar was slow. He acquired a reputation in commercial work, first in Liverpool's local courts, then in the Commercial Court in London, which he dominated from its creation in 1895. As a judge, however, he disappointed many by not fulfilling expectations, owing to his over-conscientiousness and diffidence about his abilities. Nevertheless, he was very popular among the legal profession, who held him in high esteem.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "General Council of the Bar", "response": ["*1899\u2013?: Joseph Walton"]}, {"page": "Joseph Walton", "response": ["*Joseph Walton (footballer) (1868\u20131940), English association footballer of the 1890s", "*Joseph Walton (convict) (1830\u2013?), convict transported to Western Australia", "*Sir Joseph Walton, 1st Baronet (1849\u20131923), Liberal Party MP for Barnsley, 1897\u20131922", "*Joseph Walton (judge), English judge", "*Joseph Walton (British Army officer) (died 1808), Master Gunner, St. James's Park"]}, {"page": "List of Vanity Fair (British magazine) caricatures (1900\u20131904)", "response": ["|1902-07-2424 Jul 1902||Walteon-JosephSir Joseph Walton||A lawyer on the Bench||Spy||J 66||25px"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1901", "response": ["|Joseph Walton"]}, {"page": "Alexander Dingwall Bateson", "response": ["He was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he took third-class honours in classical moderations (1887) and graduated with a pass BA degree in 1888. He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1891, and began his career in the chambers of Joseph Walton, later Mr Justice Walton. Drawing on Walton's backing and his own family connections, Bateson specialized in shipping work, mainly in salvage and collision cases in the Admiralty Division and sometime in the Commercial Court, and built a substantial practice. He was appointed junior counsel to the Admiralty for Admiralty Division work in 1909, and the following year he relinquished the appointment when he became a King's Counsel. He was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1920."]}]}}
