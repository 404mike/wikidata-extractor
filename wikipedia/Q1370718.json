In January 1914 he joined Manchester United as an outside left, but soon changed to his favoured half back position. He featured three times during the 1913/14 season before establishing himself in the team the following term. Although he joined Manchester United during the First World War, he quickly established a name for himself as an astute halfback who was an incredibly clean tackler and read the game well.\nIn the summer of 1920 he was selected by the Football Association to be part of the 20-man squad that travelled to South Africa for a 14 match tour. Hilditch featured in all three 'tests' against South Africa but it was the closest he came to international recognition.\nIn October 1926, after John Chapman was suspended for unknown reasons, Hilditch took over the manager's job for the rest of the season in addition to his playing duties.\nA stalwart in the United team for over a decade, he played 322 league games scoring 7 league goals before retiring in 1932 without winning any medals with the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester United F.C.", "response": ["| Lal Hilditch"]}, {"page": "John Chapman (football manager)", "response": ["On 7 October 1926, The Football Association announced that Chapman had been suspended from \"taking part in football or football management\" during the 1926\u201327 season \"for improper conduct in his position as Secretary-Manager of the Manchester United Football Club\".Kelly (1994), p. 68 No further explanation for the suspension was ever given.
