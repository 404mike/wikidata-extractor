He intended to base the music around real spells and chants, and asked the A&R department of his label, Virgin Records, to invite the head Druid to his home and discuss it further. The visit was unsuccessful; Oldfield's request for magic spells was turned down and he got the impression that the person was more interested in converting him to the movement. Keith Critchlow then introduced Oldfield to various \"strange people\" to gain inspiration, including poet Kathleen Raine, whose poems failed to conjure strong enough music, and a \"shaman, gypsy-type woman\" who remained silent all through her meeting with Oldfield. Then, a Virgin employee researched into British folklore and suggested Gog and Magog, from which Oldfield was able to find incantations that worked, specifically about Dianna the Huntress, which he then used as a running theme through the album."]}, {"page": "Titus Burckhardt", "response": ["*Fitzgerald, Michael O.
