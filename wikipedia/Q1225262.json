There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more. The members were: Huxley, John Tyndall, J. D. Hooker, John Lubbock (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), Herbert Spencer (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), William Spottiswoode (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), Thomas Hirst (Professor of Physics at University College London), Edward Frankland (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and George Busk, zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for HMS Dreadnought). All except Spencer were Fellows of the Royal Society. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in glaciology. p. 241. pp. 338\u2013339, 359, 379\u2013383, 406. \"During the summer of 1857 he carefully experimented with coloured liquids on the Mer de Glace and its tributaries...\" Philosophical Magazine 1857, vol xiv, p. 241. p. 327\u2013346."]}, {"page": "William Kingdon Clifford", "response": ["Clifford's contemporaries considered him acute and original, witty and warm. He often worked late into the night, which may have hastened his death.
