After the latter group split, Donegan became a journalist and an author. Between these roles, he worked as the House of Commons assistant to Labour MP Brian Wilson. Whilst in that role, he was part of a one-off band called the Stop Its that recorded an anti-poll tax song of a similar name. The band included David Hill, later press spokesman for Tony Blair, and Tim Luckhurst, who was later briefly editor of The Scotsman newspaper, and is now the head of South College at Durham University.He worked at The Scotsman and is now a golf journalist for The Guardian. He has held a post with the The Guardian since 2004, although he has been at the newspaper since 1994, as a general reporter and then as Scotland correspondent from 1997 to 2004. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Donegan gained notoriety for his overly critical reviews of the games. Journalists believed that his harsh reviews and similar critiques coming from the British media were made as an attempt to make the games look bad as the following Olympics would be held in London. In 2012, The Guardian made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the severe criticism of the prior Games by inviting a Canadian journalist to similarly critique the Summer Olympics in London as the 'worst ever'.Donegan has written non-fiction books:\n\nFour Iron in the Soul (Penguin, 1998) \u2013 the story of his year caddying for Ross Drummond, the 438th-best golfer in the world at the time, also published as Maybe It Should Have Been A 3-Iron in North America.\nCalifornia Dreaming: A Smooth-running, Low-mileage, Cut-price American Adventure (Washington Square Press, 1999) \u2013 about the time he spent as a used-car salesman in the United States.\nNo News at Throat Lake (Penguin, 2000) \u2013 about working for a bi-weekly newspaper in the small County Donegal village of Creeslough in the west of Ulster.\nQuiet Please (Yellow Jersey Press, 2004) \u2013 about his experiences as a Ryder Cup steward.\nShergar: The Final Word (HarperCollins, 2009) \u2013 the story of the kidnapping of the racehorse Shergar.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jennifer Lopez", "response": ["Lopez became the subject of widespread media criticism in 2003, due to her public relationship with Affleck and the tabloid depiction of her as a demanding diva. It was also parodied in South Park in the episode \u201cFat Butt and Pancake Head\u201d. The Guardian published an article exploring her \"bilious\" media coverage, with journalist Lawrence Donegan positing that \"indefensible\" misogyny and racism were to blame for her position as \"the most vilified woman in modern popular culture\". Lopez fired both her personal manager Benny Medina and her publicist in mid-2003;The New York Times reported that movie executives had become frustrated by having their communications with Lopez \"largely filtered\" through Medina. She became the face of Louis Vuitton's fall-winter advertising campaign and starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli (2003). The film was a box office bomb and is considered one of the worst films of all time. Rex Reed of The Observer criticized the lead actors, writing that the film reminds the world how \"pathetically incompetent they both are in the only two things that matter in career longevity - craft and talent.\" Lopez had a minor role opposite Affleck in the film Jersey Girl (2004). Following test audiences' negative reactions to the onscreen couple, Lopez's screen time was halved. Lopez later described this as the lowest point of her career and admitted she felt \u201ceviscerated\u201c by the media coverage surrounding Gigli: \"I lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\" Later in 2004, Lopez launched her second fashion label, Sweetface, and starred opposite Richard Gere in the romantic comedy-drama Shall We Dance?, which was a box office success."]}, {"page": "Lloyd Cole and the Commotions", "response": ["*Lawrence Donegan (born 13 July 1961) \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "List of people from Glasgow", "response": ["*Lawrence Donegan \u2013 journalist and author"]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Lawrence Donegan (Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, The Bluebells)"]}, {"page": "Graeme McDowell", "response": ["The \"famous win\" set off \"a brand new life\" for McDowell, according to The Guardians golf correspondent, Lawrence Donegan.
