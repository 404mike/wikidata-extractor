On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed by members of the press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood of frost that night. Believing that there would be no game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4\u20130. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club."]}, {"page": "Trevor Brooking", "response": ["In June 1967, Brooking made his senior debut in a friendly for West Ham against Grasshopper Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. His league debut came in place of wide-right Brian Dear on 29 August 1967 in a 3\u20133 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4\u20132 away win at Leicester City. His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only hat-trick came on 6 April 1968 in a 5\u20130 home defeat of Newcastle. In December 1969, during his third season, Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against Nottingham Forest. The club signed Peter Eustace for \u00a390,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected, and he considered giving up the game. However, he returned to playing and with the departure of Martin Peters to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971\u201372 season with the purchase of midfielder Tommy Taylor, and Brooking was transfer-listed at his own request. However, the failure of the defensive partnership between Bobby Moore and Alan Stephenson saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted Hammer of the Year. During the 1972\u201373 season he came to the attention of Derby County manager Brian Clough, who offered West Ham \u00a3400,000 for Brooking and Moore, but Greenwood refused to let the pair leave. Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager Bill Nicholson offered \u00a3425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and he was unsure of which manager would follow him."]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Brian Dear"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Brian Dear"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Brian Dear"]}, {"page": "Brian London", "response": ["In January 1971 English footballer Bobby Moore was embroiled in what became a national media story when he and three other West Ham United players, Jimmy Greaves, Clyde Best and Brian Dear, spent the evening at London's 007 nightclub in Blackpool, the night before an important FA Cup match against Blackpool which they went on to lose 4\u20130, with then West Ham manager Ron Greenwood and the national media severely criticising the players.

On 7 January 1971, he and three West Ham teammates, Jimmy Greaves, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, were all fined by West Ham manager Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an FA Cup third round tie against Blackpool. The nightclub in Blackpool was owned by Moore's friend, boxer Brian London. West Ham lost the tie 4\u20130. They were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of Division one at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, Moore was featured on TV as the subject on This Is Your Life the night before. Brian Glanville stated that it was not uncommon for Moore to drink heavily, but he was often seen training with West Ham the next day, working off the alcohol he had consumed the night before. On 12 June 1972, he also played for the Greek side Olympiacos, as their captain, in a friendly match against the Brazilian club Corinthians."]}, {"page": "Dear (surname)", "response": ["*Brian Dear (born 1943), English footballer"]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C. in European football", "response": ["West Ham started the competition against La Gantoise, the first Belgian side to play in this competition. In the opening game on 23 September 1964, West Ham won 1\u20130 in Belgium thanks to a headed Ronnie Boyce goal from an Alan Sealey corner. In the home leg, West Ham fans paid record match receipts to see what was described as a \"decrepit performance which brought jeers from the crowd\". Martin Peters scored an own goal for La Gentoise before Johnny Byrne scored an equalizer from a cross by Johnny Sissons In the second round, West Ham drew Czech side Sparta Prague. The first leg on 25 November contained considerable time-wasting by the Czechs including four times when the ball was kicked clean out of the ground. The match was decided in the second half by a 25-yard shot from full-back, John Bond, his first for three years and Alan Sealey, who scored after his shot had hit the post. In the second leg, on 9 December 1964, Sissons put West Ham 3\u20130 up on aggregate only for Prague's Gust\u00e1v Mr\u00e1z to score two late goals to finish the tie 3\u20132 in favour of West Ham. The quarter-finals matched West Ham against Swiss side Lausanne. In the first leg in Switzerland, Brian Dear, playing in his first European game scored the first goal, Byrne the second before Lausanne scored in the 80th minute through Robert Hosp. The second leg, described as a \"thrilling cup-tie\" took place at the Boleyn Ground on 23 March 1965. Two goals from Dear, one from Peters and an own goal from Lausanne's Ely Tacchella gave West Ham an aggregate 6\u20134 win. The Lausanne goals were scored by Pierre Kerkhoffs, Hertig and Norbert Eschmann. The semi-finals West Ham played Spanish side, Real Zaragoza. In the first leg in London, West Ham scored two first-half goals through Dear and Byrne. They attempted to defend their lead in the second half by playing nine in defence but conceded a 55th goal scored by Can\u00e1rio. The second leg in Spain finished as a 1\u20131 draw with goals from Sissons and Zaragoza's Carlos Lapetra. Zaragoza were denied three penalty appeals and blamed the referee for their defeat. The final against West German side 1860 Munich was played at Wembley on 19 May 1965 in front of 100,000 spectators. It has been described as \"West Ham's greatest moment\". Alan Sealey scored in the 69th and 71st minute, the first from an \"impossible angle\" and the second after Bobby Moore's free-kick was not cleared by the Munich defence. Manager Greenwood, in his 1984 book Yours Sincerely, noted the significant roles played by Sealey, Dear and Bobby Moore in the final but also praised West Ham's defence, particularly the efforts of goalkeeper Jim Standen and defender Jack Burkett."]}, {"page": "Dear, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Dear"]}]}}
