Some people credit American Dudley Riggs as the first vaudevillian to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by Viola Spolin in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book Improvisation For The Theater, the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1977, Clive Barker's book Theatre Games (several translations and editions) had an international effect. British playwright and director Keith Johnstone wrote Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre, a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented Theatresports, which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show Whose Line Is It Anyway?"]}, {"page": "Drama therapy", "response": ["Drama therapy works to shed light on feelings and behaviors of a person and helps teach them ways to manage and overcome obstacles they struggle with.Landy, R.

Although drama therapists most frequently work in groups, they also treat individuals, helping them to identify problematic issues in their lives and to discover effective ways to move through their distress.\" Clive Barker has called this a \"journey through our own psychic landscape.\" The hope is that by taking on specific roles a person can gain personal insight and break free from barriers.Landy, R.

Progressions and developments can be slow going, and participants may be resistant to the process.Landy, R. J., & Montgomery, D. T. (2012). Theatre for Change: Education, Social Action and Therapy.
