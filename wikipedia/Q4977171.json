In the neo soul song the lyrics chronicles the man's promise to the mistress and come clean about the relationship. It was released as the album's fourth single on July 31, 2006 to urban contemporary stations in the United States. An accompanying music video was released several days earlier and portrays the artists as love interests. ", "\"Lie About Us\" has been labelled as neo soul by Dee. The song is about secret relationship of a man and his mistress with the promise to leave the other woman and come clean to the world about their affair as chronicled in the lines, \"Please don't say you wanna give up / How do I tell her that I'm fallin' in love / And I know you're waiting patiently for that day that we no longer have to lie about us\". Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters noted that the mistress has doubts and isn't going into this blindly. \"Lie About Us\" was inspired by Beau Dozier's relationship with soul singer Joss Stone. Dozier fell in love with Stone while he was dating another woman, but eventually finished things in favor for Stone. They spent two years together before splitting in November 2005. Dozier co-wrote it with Bruce Boniface and produced it with Ron Fair.", "*Bruce Bonifacesongwriter"]}, {"page": "BruceBoniface", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bruce Boniface"]}, {"page": "List of Virgin Records artists", "response": ["* Bruce Boniface"]}, {"page": "List of songs recorded by Nicole Scherzinger", "response": ["| Beau Dozier  Bruce Boniface"]}]}}
