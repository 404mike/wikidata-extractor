From 1900, the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined; the last of them were Fred Whibley on Niutao, Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau, and Martin Kleis on Nui. By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies, although Whibley, Restieaux and Kleis remained in the islands until their deaths."]}, {"page": "History of Tuvalu", "response": ["The last of the traders were Martin Kleis on Nui, Fred Whibley on Niutao and Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau; who remained in the islands until their deaths."]}, {"page": "Niutao", "response": ["Palagi copra traders known to have been resident on Niutao are: Charlie Douglas (1850s); Mr Tom, Mr Jack, Mr Ah Fong and Mr Tong (c. 1861); Mr McKenzie (c. 1866); George Winchcombe (c. 1876-1880);Letter of George Lewis Becke quoted by James A.
