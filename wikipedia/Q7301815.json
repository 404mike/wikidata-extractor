Following a 1\u20130 defeat by Stevenage in the League Two play-off final in May 2011, he left the club to become the manager of newly relegated Bristol Rovers. He replaced many of the playing staff, but the team won only six of their first 23 league games and, in January 2012, Buckle was dismissed from the club. In April 2012 Buckle was confirmed as the new manager of Luton Town following the departure of Gary Brabin. He led the club to the play-off final at Wembley Stadium, losing 2\u20131 to York City, and later ensured his team became the first from non-League to defeat a top flight side in the FA Cup for 24 years when Luton beat Norwich City 1\u20130. Buckle left Luton in February 2013 for personal reasons. Buckle married sports broadcaster Rebecca Lowe in June 2013 and later moved to the US where he was appointed as technical director at the Met Oval in New York in November of that year. He returned to the Football League in November 2014 to take the manager's job at Cheltenham Town in League Two but left in February 2015.

After a solid start to the 2012\u201313 season, which saw Buckle's side keep pace with the leaders, Luton's league form soon collapsed with the club winning only three league games between November 2012 and February 2013.
