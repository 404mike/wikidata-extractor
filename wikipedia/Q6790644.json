Despite conceding an early goal United came back to score twice in the second half and book their place in the second round. Back in League One an away trip to Swindon Town ended in a 0\u20130 stalemate, but it was a result that allowed United to climb into the automatic promotion places for the first time in the season. A few days later vice-captain Neill Collins extended his current contract by a further two years until Summer 2015 with the option of another year, before the Blades unbeaten run finally came to an end as they conceded a controversial last minute penalty to lose 1\u20130 away at Milton Keynes Dons. The following week Matthew Harriott was allowed to join Alfreton Town on loan, initially until 9 December, while Harry Maguire made his England Under-21 d\u00e9but as a substitute in the 60th minute, coming on for Liverpool's Andre Wisdom in a 2\u20130 against Northern Ireland Under-21 at Bloomfield Road. A few days later it was announced that Danny Wilson had been named League One Manager of the Month and that George Long had won League One Player of the Month for October. Later the same day, Dave Kitson extended his contract until the end of the season with the option of another year; Kitson stated that \"It wouldn't have sat comfortably with me to leave a job half done after integrating myself into a great squad\". At the end of a busy week free agent and former Wales national goalkeeper Danny Coyne signed a 28-day deal as cover for George Long as third choice keeper George Willis had sustained a minor injury preventing him from playing. Seven days after the disappointing defeat at MK Dons, United returned to winning ways in emphatic style, convincingly beating promotion rivals Stevenage 4\u20131 at Bramall Lane, thanks in part to a brace from Shaun Miller who was making his first league start for United. A mid-week home fixture against Crewe Alexandra followed which ended in a 3\u20133 draw, despite United having taken a two-goal lead in the first half. The following day Jordan Chapell extended his loan with Burton Albion for a further month, before the final game of November saw United slip to a damaging 2\u20130 defeat away at Brentford.", "On 1 December the Blades returned to winning ways with a late 2\u20131 victory over former United boss Micky Adams's Port Vale side in the second round of the FA Cup at Bramall Lane. Shaun Miller saved the day for the Blades with a brace in injury time after Vale had taken the lead in the first half. With the Blades beginning to struggle with injuries Jordan Chapell was recalled early from his loan spell at Burton Albion, and returned to the United first-team later that day as the Blades crashed out of the Football League Trophy on penalties to Coventry City. Meanwhile, Matthew Harriott extended his loan deal with Alfreton Town until 6 January and back in the league United returned to winning ways, defeating Carlisle United 3\u20131, but were held to a 0\u20130 draw by table-topping Tranmere Rovers the following week. After Danny Coyne extended his short-term contract to keep him with the club until the end of January, United started their festive programme by rising to the top of the League One table following a 2\u20130 win over Crawley Town on their first ever visit to the Broadfield Stadium thanks to two goals from Tony McMahon, before a comfortable 3\u20130 home win over Scunthorpe United on Boxing Day consolidated their place as league leaders. With injuries and suspensions starting to weaken the first-team United finished the year by slipping to a surprising 2\u20133 home defeat to bottom club Hartlepool United, a result which saw them drop to second in the table. On 28 December it was announced that due to injuries sustained against Scunthorpe United, Shaun Miller would be out for the remainder of the season and out up to nine months in total with a cruciate knee ligament injury; whilst Neill Collins would be out for around two months with a fractured cheekbone.", "| Matthew Harriott", "|Matthew Harriott"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["Unlike the previous three years, Sheffield United opted not to undertake a pre-season tour of Malta; instead preferring a short trip to Scotland for three matches, before returning to England for a trio of friendlies against League Two sides. At the start of June Barry Robson agreed a deal with Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen, signalling his departure from Bramall Lane. Later that week youth Team coach and former assistant manager, David Unsworth, was given permission by United to speak with Kilmarnock about their vacant managerial position, but rejected the approach. With Barry Robson having already left the club, United subsequently announced their retained list, and signalled the departure of Danny Coyne, Matthew Harriott, Lecsinel Jean-Fran\u00e7ois and Dave Kitson. However they also indicated that Aaron Barry, Jordan Chapell, Danny Higginbotham, Jordan Hodder, Terry Kennedy, Callum McFadzean, Jahmal Smith and Elliott Whitehouse had all taken the option to have their contracts extended. Manager David Weir began to pull together his back-room team by appointing former Rangers fitness coach Adam Owen to the position of \"Assistant Manager \u2013 Performance\" on 21 June. A few days later United unveiled their first signings of the close season; Stephen McGinn from Watford, Sean McGinty from Manchester United and Febian Brandy from Walsall all on two-year deals; whilst Jasper Johns was signed from Everton signed a one-year deal."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 26 || CM || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Matthew Harriott"]}, {"page": "Harriott, Matthew", "response": ["#redirectMatthew Harriott"]}]}}
