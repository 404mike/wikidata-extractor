For his county Yorkshire he was their regular wicket-keeper between 1947 and 1953, taking a total of 380 dismissals in those seven seasons. A poor batsman, he averaged 10.52 in first-class cricket with only a single fifty in 232 appearances. Cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, noted after Brennan had replaced Godfrey Evans in the England cricket team, that \"there can be few higher tributes to his 'keeping skills than that\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
