For his county Yorkshire he was their regular wicket-keeper between 1947 and 1953, taking a total of 380 dismissals in those seven seasons. A poor batsman, he averaged 10.52 in first-class cricket with only a single fifty in 232 appearances. Cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, noted after Brennan had replaced Godfrey Evans in the England cricket team, that \"there can be few higher tributes to his 'keeping skills than that\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["Boycott's eight seasons of captaincy were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club failed to win any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The beginning of the end of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed.McKinstry, pp. 174\u2013175. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503\u00a0runs at an average of 100.12, including a century in his first match as captain.Boycott, p. 163. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.McKinstry, p. 122."]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Don Brennan"]}, {"page": "Eccleshill, Bradford", "response": ["and Yorkshire and England cricketer Don Brennan (1920\u20131985) was born in Eccleshill."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Don Brennan \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Don Brennan", "response": ["Don Brennan may refer to:", "*Don Brennan (cricketer) (1920\u20131985), English cricketer", "*Don Brennan (Coronation Street)", "*Don Brennan (baseball) (1903\u20131953), pitcher in Major League Baseball"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone.

In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches.
