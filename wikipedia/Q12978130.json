In the County Championship-winning years of 1927 and 1928, he was among the top half-dozen batsmen in England and his career average was more than 40 runs per innings. Yet he played only twice for England, once in 1921 and then again once in the inaugural Tests against the West Indies in 1928, scoring 42 runs in all and being dismissed only once. He was also a fine fieldsman with a superb throw.In 1928, Hallows scored more than 1,000 runs in the month of May, a feat previously achieved only by W. G. Grace and Wally Hammond and never since.  He needed 232 runs to complete 1,000 in his last innings in May. He made that score and was out the next ball. But within four years, he had drifted out of the Lancashire team at the age of 37, taking up a series of professional appointments with league cricket clubs in England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.He coached at Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby, Belvedere College, Dublin, and Kimberley High School in South Africa, before being appointed coach at Worcestershire in 1957. He later took up the same role at Lancashire, retiring at the age of 74 in 1969. David Lloyd says that he was headhunted by the county.He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1928.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1927 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Roger Blunt, Charlie Hallows, Wally Hammond, Douglas Jardine, Vallance Jupp"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Charlie Hallows"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["After the war Lancashire developed a very strong batting side, including Ernest Tyldesley and Johnny Tyldesley, both Test batsmen. In 1920, Lancashire finished runner up and bowlers Harry Dean and Lawrence Cook took 274\u00a0wickets between them. During 1921, interest in cricket reached an all-time high, with over 250,000 people attending Old Trafford and over 4,500 members. 1922 was a year of contradictions, a strong team winning seven out of fifteen matches by an innings, but still managing to lose seven and finish 5th; that season Cec Parkin and Lawrence Cook mustered 308\u00a0wickets between them and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs. Retrieved on 20\u00a0October 2007. Lancashire's steady progress was capped by a hat trick of championship titles between 1926 and 1928 under the captaincy of Leonard Green. In the 1926 victory, Ernest Tyldesley and Harry Makepeace each scored over 2,000\u00a0runs. In 1927, Charlie Hallows scored six centuries and the bowling attack was led by Dick Tyldesley and Ted McDonald with support from Frank Sibbles. In 1928, Frank Watson and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs each and George Duckworth claimed 107 victims and earned recognition as one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year. At the end of the season Leonard Green decided to retire with a record of three successive championships and 42 wins against just three defeats.

Even so, Jack Hobbs said that Constantine's opening overs to him in the first Test were among the fastest he ever faced, Constantine believed his captain, Karl Nunes, over-bowled him; the pair did not get along well. When the tour ended, Constantine had scored more runs and taken more wickets and catches in first-class games than any other tourist. He was second in the team's batting averages with 1,381 runs at 34.52, and led the bowling averages with 107 wickets at 22.95.Howat (1976), p. 55. It was the manner in which Constantine played which set him apart from the restrained form of cricket generally played in England at the time: his style, aggression and entertainment value made a big impression on the crowds. According to Peter Mason in his biography of Constantine, he established a unique style of West Indian cricket and possibly established the template for West Indian cricketers for years to come.Mason, pp. 28\u201329."]}, {"page": "Geoff Pullar", "response": ["He was, in any case, a skilled batsman, rarely lifting the ball off the surface while driving elegantly and adept at accumulating by flicking the ball off his toes towards fine leg.
