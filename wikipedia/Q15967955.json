In the Strategy paper the examiner, J. F. C. Fuller, awarded him 1,000 marks out of a possible 1,000. The advantage of gaining the p.s.c. (passed Staff College) was that the two-year course provided a network of 180 highly trained officers for help afterwards. By arriving with such a splash, it is probable that Dorman-Smith became regarded with suspicion by people who would one day be his peers and superior officers.Greacen pp. 96\u20137 Many of Dorman-Smith's fellow students there included the future general officers of the Second World War, including Philip Christison, Evelyn Barker, Oliver Leese, Eric Hayes, John Hawkesworth, Ronald Penney, John Whiteley, Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman, Eric Nares, Charles Norman, Stanley Kirby, Wilfrid Lloyd, Reginald Savory and Clement West.Smart, p. 88"]}, {"page": "Oliver Leese", "response": ["After the war, he remained in the British Army, being promoted captain in 1921, and attending the Staff College, Camberley from 1927 to 1928.

He judged that had the division been retained, it could have reinforced the Fourteenth Army, making the defence of Imphal and Kohima in 1944 easier. Historian F. W. Perry wrote, \"it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the results achieved by the force did not represent an adequate return for the resources invested\". He further argued that the force was too lightly armed to capture strongly held positions or to hold one if captured, and concluded that Special Force \"inflicted more damage and disruption on the British Army than it ever did on the Japanese.\" Similarly, Slim argued in his memoirs that it had been a mistake to break up the 70th Division as it was the only British division which had been trained in jungle warfare, and that it would have been twice as effective as an experienced conventional formation than it proved to be as part of Special Force."]}, {"page": "Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman", "response": ["After the war, he was private secretary to his father in 1918 and became captain in 1921.

None of the senior officers present had been in post more than a few weeks and the senior air officer had been relieved following the destruction of his air forces at the beginning of April. Neither Kitazono nor Endo had been able to prepare a comprehensive defensive plan, and in any event had neither the men nor the resources to carry it out. On the other hand, the Allied operation had been over-insured; concerns over the strength of the Japanese garrison had left the Allies with a four to one advantage in the event. Historian Edward J. Drea attributed the success of the operation largely to MacArthur's bold decision to exploit intelligence gained through code breaking, and judged it was \"MacArthur's finest hour in World War II and ULTRA's single greatest contribution to the general's Pacific strategy\". Stephen R. Taaffe reached a similar conclusion."]}, {"page": "Charles Norman (British Army officer)", "response": ["After being released in 1919, he remained in the army, initially with the 9th Lancers serving around the British Empire, in India and Egypt.

There were disagreements with Stanley Kirby, the author of the British official history on the war with Japan about the analysis of events in Singapore. Wigmore also had to deal with attempts by a member of the Australian Government, Wilfrid Kent Hughes, who was a prominent former officer in the 8th Division, to influence his treatment of Gordon Bennett's leadership of the division in Singapore. Bennett himself tried to sway the coverage of his command. Wigmore already had an acrimonious relationship with Bennett from his own time in Singapore and this worsened with allegations from Bennett of bias and inaccuracy. By request of the British Government, publication of the book was delayed until 1957, by which time Malayan independence had been granted. The public reception to The Japanese Thrust was favourable and it reviewed well."]}]}}
