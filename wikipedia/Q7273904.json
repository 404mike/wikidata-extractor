The song depicts the joys of the well known Cockney dish of the same name which was eaten frequently in London's East End community at the turn of the 20th century. \"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\" was written for Champion by Fred Murray and R. P. Weston in 1910. The song is a playful reworking of the life and times of Henry VIII, in this case not the monarch, but the eighth husband of the \"widow next door. She'd been married seven times before.\" \"Any Old Iron\" was written for Champion by Charles Collins, E.A. Sheppard and Fred Terry in 1911. The song is about a man who inherits an old watch and chain. Champion later recorded it on the EMI label on 29 October 1935 and was accompanied by the London Palladium Orchestra. The song has often been covered by fellow artistes including Stanley Holloway and Peter Sellers.\"Any Old Iron\" Parlophone, catalogue no.

He also performed songs, many written for him by Bert Lee and R. P. Weston, such as \"She Was Poor, But She Was Honest\".
