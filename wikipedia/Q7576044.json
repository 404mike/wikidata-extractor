The Green Flag, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1972, p. 488. . and Fergusson (GOC 5th Infantry Division), and three staff officers, at his Parkgate Street H.Q. in Dublin. Three different accounts exist (written by Paget, by Fergusson, and by Gough in his memoirs Soldiering On), but it is clear that Paget exacerbated the situation. By Gough's account, he said that \"active operations were to commence against Ulster\". Paget then claimed that he had obtained \"concessions\" from Seely, namely that officers who lived in Ulster would be permitted to \"disappear\" for the duration, and that other officers who refused to serve against Ulster would be dismissed rather than being permitted to resign. French, Paget, and Adjutant-General Spencer Ewart had indeed (on 19 March) agreed to exclude officers with \"direct family connections\" to Ulster, and to dismiss other officers who refused to participate. Paget told Gough, who queried whether \"disappear\" meant absence with or without leave, and who had a family connection to Ulster but did not live there, that he could expect no mercy from \"his old friend at the War Office\" (John French). Richard Holmes wrote that in effectively offering his officers an ultimatum, Paget was acting foolishly, as the majority might simply have obeyed if simply ordered north. Paget ended the meeting by ordering his officers to speak to their subordinates and then report back. Fergusson collared Gough and one of the infantry brigadiers, and warned that the Army must hold together at all costs, and that he himself would obey orders. Gough said that he would not, and went off to speak to the officers of the 5th Lancers (one of the regiments under his command) and also sent a telegram to his brother Johnnie, Haig's Chief of Staff at Aldershot. Gough did not attend the second meeting in the afternoon, at which Paget confirmed that the purpose of the move was to overawe Ulster rather than fight. No provision was made for enlisted men who had conscientious objections.Jeffery 2006, p. 120. The deployment orders were headed \"'Duty as ordered \u2013 Active Operations in Ulster\", and Gough later suggested that \"active operations\" sounded as if it were much more than a cautionary protective deployment.", "The matter was debated in the Commons at length on 23 and 25 March.Hansard; Adjournment Debate, HC Deb 23 March 1914 vol 60 cc72-139Hansard; \"Colonel Seely and the cabinet,\" HC Deb vol 60 cc392-458 Asquith (25 March) publicly repudiated the \"peccant paragraphs\" which had been added to the Cabinet statement, and French, the Adjutant-General Spencer Ewart and Seely had to resign.Holmes 2004, pp. 190\u2013192."]}, {"page": "Military Secretary (United Kingdom)", "response": ["The title was formally changed to Military Secretary to the Secretary of State for War in 1904.Sir John Spencer Ewart Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives It was sometimes referred to in military jargon as Military Secretary at Headquarters.

By the mid-19th Century, honours were being awarded for contemporary actions that were little more than skirmishes compared with the great European battles of the 18th Century. Much, too, depended on the persistence (or lack thereof) of successive individual colonels in badgering Horse Guards for honours for their regiments: to give but one example, the honour for Corunna was first awarded (to three battalions) in 1811; between then and 1842, it was awarded to a further 27 regiments and battalions.Corunna was awarded to a final three regiments in 1908. See Rodger (2003), pp. 29-30.A record for lack of success in this endeavour appears to be held by the 16th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1688 and awarded its first honours, for Marlborough's four great victories, as the Bedfordshire Regiment in 1882. The regiment was, in consequence, ironically known as The Peacekeepers. See Sumner and Hook (2001b) p. 31. A committee was therefore set up under Major-General Sir Archibald Alison in 1881 to determine the honours that should be awarded to the various regiments for past battles.Farwell (2001), p. 22Norman (1911), p. 433 Although the Alison Committee remedied the worst of the injustices when it reported in 1882 (by, inter alia, awarding the honours Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet), another committee had to be set up in 1909 under the chairmanship of Lieutenant General Sir Spencer Ewart to continue the work.Norman (1911), p. 434\u2013435"]}, {"page": "John Spencer Ewart", "response": ["#REDIRECT Spencer Ewart"]}, {"page": "Adjutant-General to the Forces", "response": ["*1910 to 1914 Lieutenant-General Sir Spencer Ewart"]}, {"page": "General Ewart", "response": ["#REDIRECTSpencer Ewart"]}, {"page": "John Alexander Ewart", "response": ["They had two sons who came to fame in their own right: Lt General John Spencer Ewart aide-de-camp to King George V and Rear Admiral Arthur Ewart."]}, {"page": "General Ewart (disambiguation)", "response": ["Spencer Ewart (1861\u20131930) was a British Army lieutenant general.
