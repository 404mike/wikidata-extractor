Among his many compositions, he is best known for The Triumph of Time (1972) and his operas, particularly The Mask of Orpheus (1986), Gawain (1991) and The Minotaur (2008). The latter was ranked by music critics at The Guardian in 2019 as the third best piece of the 21st-century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Accrington", "response": ["*Harrison Birtwistle, composer"]}, {"page": "July 15", "response": ["*1934 \u2013 Harrison Birtwistle, English composer and academic"]}, {"page": "John Harrison", "response": ["In 1998, British composer Harrison Birtwistle wrote the piano piece \"Harrison's clocks\" that contains musical depictions of Harrison's various clocks.

Graham worked simultaneously on the brass band and wind band versions of the piece, which received their first performances just four months apart, in October 2000 and February 2001 respectively."]}, {"page": "Karlheinz Stockhausen", "response": ["Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily acknowledges the influence of Stockhausen's Zeitma\u00dfe (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally. Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the \"technical and speculative innovations\" of Klavierst\u00fccke I\u2013IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter, they nevertheless produced a \"sharp emotion, the result of a beneficial shock engendered by their boldness\" and provided \"an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations\". While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British premi\u00e8re of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets\u2014how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core\u2014but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. Although it eventually evolved in a direction of its own, Ferneyhough's 1967 wind sextet, Prometheus, began as a wind quintet with cor anglais, stemming directly from an encounter with Stockhausen's Zeitma\u00dfe. With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, it seems to me that the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time. ... I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that \"Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course\" and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carr\u00e9, Klavierst\u00fcck X, Inori, and Jubil\u00e4um."]}, {"page": "Manchester", "response": ["Manchester has two symphony orchestras, the Hall\u00e9 and the BBC Philharmonic, and a chamber orchestra, the Manchester Camerata. In the 1950s, the city was home to a so-called \"Manchester School\" of classical composers, which was composed of Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies, David Ellis and Alexander Goehr. Manchester is a centre for musical education: the Royal Northern College of Music and Chetham's School of Music. Forerunners of the RNCM were the Northern School of Music (founded 1920) and the Royal Manchester College of Music (founded 1893), which merged in 1973. One of the earliest instructors and classical music pianists/conductors at the RNCM, shortly after its founding, was the Russian-born Arthur Friedheim, (1859\u20131932), who later had the music library at the famed Peabody Institute conservatory of music in Baltimore, Maryland, named after him.

This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight.

After moving to London under the reign of Qeen Anne, George Frideric Handel became a naturalised British citizen in 1727, when he composed the anthem Zadok the Priest for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Many of Handel's best-known works, such as Messiah, were written in the English language. Notable 19th- and 20th-century British composers include Edward Elgar, Hubert Parry, Gustav Holst, Arthur Sullivan (most famous for working with the librettist W. S.
