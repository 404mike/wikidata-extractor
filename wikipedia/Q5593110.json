Spearheaded by the prolific strike partnership of Ian Wallace and Mick Ferguson, and ably abetted by the legendary winger Tommy Hutchison and attacking full backs Graham Oakey and Bobby MacDonald, the Sky Blues would enjoy a 7th-place finish in the 1977\u201378 season, narrowly missing out on European football. Yorath's Coventry side containing such notables as Alan Green, McDonald and Mick Coop are still fondly remembered even today by the Sky Blue faithful. A remarkable 5\u20134 win over Norwich City at Highfield Road, Christmas 1977, replete with bicycle kick by Ian Wallace and last gasp penalty save by Jim Blyth, lives long in Coventry folklore."]}, {"page": "Gordon Milne", "response": ["Milne joined Joe Mercer at Coventry City as team manager in June 1972, taking full control in 1974, upon Mercer's elevation to the Board. He was shortlisted for the England management role following the departure of Sir Alf Ramsey, but was overlooked in favour of Don Revie. He continued at Coventry until 1981, producing several exciting teams and securing the club's First Division status. The 1977\u201378 season saw Coventry's most exciting top-flight team. Gordon Milne settled on an attacking 4\u20132\u20134 formation. A side containing Tommy Hutchison, Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby MacDonald and Jim Blyth played attacking football that swept many teams aside, often by large margins of victory."]}, {"page": "Ray Graydon", "response": ["Graydon joined Coventry City for the 1977\u201378 season for a fee of \u00a335,000. Although in and out of the side he still made a significant contribution to what would be one of the most exciting campaigns in the club's 34-year top-flight history. Manager Gordon Milne played the whole season with a 4\u20132\u20134 formation with Graydon and Tommy Hutchison playing as out-and-out wingers. The side also boasted Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby McDonald and Jim Blyth."]}, {"page": "John Beck (footballer)", "response": ["Beck started his playing career at Queens Park Rangers signing in May 1972 and made his debut in the 3\u20131 win against Leyton Orient in December 1972. Beck was unable to hold down a regular place in the immensely successful QPR side of the mid 1970s, competing with England captain Gerry Francis and Scottish international Don Masson for the creative midfield role. In 1976, the year that QPR finished second to Liverpool in the First Division, he moved to Coventry City after playing 40 league games for Rangers, scoring once. The 1977\u201378 season saw John Beck playing in what was arguably Coventry's most exciting top-flight team of all time. Gordon Milne's side containing Tommy Hutchison, Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby MacDonald and Jim Blyth played scintillating attacking football that swept many teams aside, often by large margins of victory, although they failed to win any silverware or qualify for the UEFA Cup."]}, {"page": "Jim Blyth (footballer, born 1955)", "response": ["Blyth played for Coventry City from 1972\u20131982, making 151 league appearances. His ability led to a proposed \u00a3440,000 transfer to Manchester United in 1979 which failed to go through when he failed a medical on a suspect back. This move would have made him the world's most expensive goalkeeper. He earned two caps for the Scotland national football team, and was Scotland's second-choice goalkeeper at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The 1977\u201378 season saw Jim playing in Coventry's most exciting top-flight team. A side containing Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby McDonald and Tommy Hutchison played a brand of attacking football that swept many teams aside, often by large margins of victory. One of the most memorable games of that year came at Christmas when Norwich City visited Highfield Road. The game reached its zenith in the final minutes when Blyth saved John Ryan's penalty kick to help Coventry to a 5\u20134 victory. In the same season he was Man of the Match in the home game against Liverpool when he turned in a faultless performance in a 1-0 victory, making several saves in particular from David Fairclough and a penalty from Phil Neal."]}, {"page": "Ian Wallace (footballer, born 1956)", "response": ["Wallace was purchased for \u00a370,000 by the then Coventry manager Gordon Milne in 1976. Milne paired his small frame with his larger strike partner Mick Ferguson. He emerged from a car accident whilst at the club sporting a deep scar on the forehead. He also suffered a detached a retina whilst playing for Coventry at Norwich. Coventry finished 7th in the 1977-78 Football League, their second best ever placing after the team of 1969-70. Unlike in 1969-70 they missed out on a UEFA competition place. Wallace played that season alongside Ferguson, Tommy Hutchison, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby MacDonald and Jim Blyth. Wallace scored 23 goals that season, his first of three in a row as Coventry's top scorer. He was later inducted in to the Coventry City Hall of Fame."]}, {"page": "Mick Ferguson", "response": ["Ferguson was discovered by Coventry City's scouting system, broadened under Jimmy Hill's management to be able to identify young talent anywhere in the country.  In his first spell at the club he scored 51 goals in 127 league games over a six-year period. In 1977, he was top scorer with 13 league goals, but the following season he and Ian Wallace formed a devastating strike partnership scoring 37 league goals between them; Ferguson's share was 17 from 30 games, including three hat-tricks. Ferguson was a key member of what was Coventry's most exciting top-flight team. Playing alongside Ian Wallace, Bobby McDonald, Tommy Hutchison, Terry Yorath and Graham Oakey Ferguson was often unplayable in the air, while surprisingly skilful for such a tall player on the floor. He is one of 30 players selected for Coventry City's Hall of Fame. During this period he was regularly considered for inclusion into the England international squad, though the call-up never came."]}, {"page": "Donato Nardiello", "response": ["He began his career as an apprentice with Coventry City, and signed a professional contract in 1977. The 1978-79 saw Donato playing in a Coventry's side containing Tommy Hutchison, Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby MacDonald and Jim Blyth. During his first season with the Sky Blues, he played twice for the Welsh international side."]}]}}
