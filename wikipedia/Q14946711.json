Along with his friend Ilya Neustadt, he made a major contribution to the development of the University's Department of Sociology, which became one of the largest and most influential departments in the United Kingdom. He retired in 1962, but continued to teach graduate students in Leicester until the mid-1970s. Among subsequently famous sociologists whom Neustadt and Elias appointed as colleagues at Leicester, were John H. Goldthorpe, Anthony Giddens, Martin Albrow, Sheila Allen, Joe and Olive Banks, Richard Brown, Mary McIntosh, Nicos Mouzelis and Sami Zubaida and Keith Hopkins. (Hopkins was subsequently Professor of Ancient History at Cambridge: his appointment to teach sociology in Leicester is one sign of the very broad conception Elias and Neustadt had of the discipline of sociology.) Students in the department included John Eldridge, Chris Bryant, Chris Rojek, Paul Hirst, Graeme Salaman and Bryan Wilson. From 1962 to 1964, Elias taught as Professor of Sociology at the University of Ghana in Legon near Accra. After his return to Europe in 1965, he spent much time as visiting professor in various German and Dutch universities, and from 1978 based himself in Amsterdam."]}, {"page": "Enfield County School", "response": ["* Olive Banks (n\u00e9e Davies), historian of feminism"]}, {"page": "Margaret Llewelyn Davies", "response": ["Davies worked as a voluntary sanitary inspector and was impressed by the co-operative theory of the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers. She joined the Marylebone Co-operative Society in 1886, and shortly afterward was elected as secretary of the Marylebone group of the Co-operative Women's Guild. A year later, she was elected to the Guild's national executive committee. Davies and her friend Rosalind Mary Shore Smith researched profit-sharing workshops in 1888, and recommended against their adoption by the movement. She was appointed as general secretary of the Guild in 1889, retaining that role until 1921. During her tenure, the Guild became far more politically active than it previously had been. The same year that she became general secretary, the family moved to Kirkby Lonsdale, where her father was a rector at St Mary's Church. In Kirkby Lonsdale, Davies worked closely with Lilian Harris, who became the Guild's cashier in 1893 and its assistant secretary in 1901. Olive Banks wrote in her 1985 Biographical dictionary of British feminists that \"it was soon obvious ... that Margaret had found more than a co-worker, for Lilian was to be her life-long friend and companion.\" In 1908, Davies's father retired, and Davies and Harris moved to Hampstead, where her father stayed with them until his death in 1916."]}]}}
