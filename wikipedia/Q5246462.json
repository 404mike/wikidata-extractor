He struggled to make an impact and joined Barnet two years later. He made 125 appearances for the club before joining Charlton Athletic, where he again struggled to hold down a place in the first team and eventually spent time on loan with Cheltenham Town and Grimsby Town as well as briefly returning to Barnet for a month. In 2010, he returned to Grimsby on a permanent basis but the season ended with a loan at Cambridge United. Following his release from Grimsby in 2011 he went on to have spells with Arlesey Town, Hayes & Yeading and Lowestoft Town before signing with Woking in August 2012. He was released just a few months later and signed with Sutton United in February 2013.\nWhilst with Barnet, Sinclair was capped 5 times by the England C team, scoring one goal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Hunt (footballer)", "response": ["He joined Grimsby Town in early 2007 on loan and was instrumental in the club's successful fight to avoid relegation. He was out of contract with the Pirates in the summer so signed permanently for the Mariners. Hunt cemented himself as one of the first-team regulars in the side managed by Alan Buckley during the 2007\u20132008 season. Buckley was sacked as manager in the early part of the following season, and when he was replaced by Mike Newell, Newell opted to bring in such players as Jean-Paul Kalala. Hunt found himself froze out of the first-team, until the late season when he managed to re-established his place in Grimsby's first-team following injuries to Kalala and Dean Sinclair. Hunt managed to hold a regular position down and became an integral part of the team that for the third season in a row managed to avoid relegation. Despite earning a place back in the team, Hunt was released by Newell, stating that at the age of 33, Grimsby could not offer Hunt first-team football."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Charlton Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| 27 July 2007 ||||Dean Sinclair|| Barnet||\u00a3125,000||"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["The match was played on 26 October 2005, and United won 4\u20131.
