Her immunity agreement restricted what she could talk about publicly, but she was able to cooperate with Andrew Morton in his writing of Monica's Story, her biography which included her side of the Clinton affair. The book was published in March 1999; it was also excerpted as a cover story in Time magazine. On March 3, 1999, Barbara Walters interviewed Lewinsky on ABC's 20/20. The program was watched by 70 million Americans, which ABC said was a record for a news show.

In 1989, Diana was at a birthday party for Camilla's sister, Annabel Elliot, when she confronted Camilla about her and Charles's extramarital affair. These affairs were later exposed in May 1992 with the publication of Andrew Morton's book, Diana: Her True Story. The book, which also revealed Diana's allegedly suicidal unhappiness, caused a media storm. In 1991, James Colthurst had conducted secret interviews with Diana in which she had talked about her marital issues and difficulties.

On her instructions, according to Andrew Morton on the basis of an interview with Rogers's stepdaughter-in-law 80 years later, the ghost-writer made no mention of her confession that Herman Rogers was actually the love of her life. At her hideaway, Wallis was pressured by Lord Brownlow, the King's lord-in-waiting, to renounce the King. On December 7, 1936, Lord Brownlow read to the press her statement, which he had helped her draft, indicating Wallis's readiness to give up the King. However, Edward was determined to marry Wallis. John Theodore Goddard, Wallis's solicitor, stated:  client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [Edward VIII] was determined.\" This seemingly indicated that the King had decided he had no option but to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis."]}, {"page": "List of biographers", "response": ["*Andrew Morton (En, born 1953) \u2013 Princess Diana, Monica Lewinsky and Tom Cruise"]}, {"page": "Bert Fields", "response": ["In January 2008, Fields, representing Tom Cruise, stated that an unauthorized biography (by British author Andrew Morton) was full of \"tired old lies\" or \"sick stuff.\""]}, {"page": "Paul McGann", "response": ["| The Biographer || Andrew Morton ||"]}, {"page": "Madonna", "response": ["Madonna's acting performances in films have frequently received poor reviews from film critics.

While reviewing her career retrospective titled Body of Work (2016) at New York's Metrograph hall, The Guardians Nigel M.

Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it in the soundtrack of her 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan. Unlike the other songs on Like a Virgin, \"Into the Groove\" was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted that at one point of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing with the rest of the composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up to the microphone and sang the words \"Live out your fantasy here with me\". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: \"[The song] seemed to come out of her, I was awestruck.\" The song consists of instrumentation from drums, percussion, congas and whistles. Madonna's voice is double-tracked in the chorus.

According to Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, the video represented the female fantasy of behaving like a \"bad boy\" and doing things associated with men. They pointed out the scene in which Madonna winks at three men at a traffic light just before crashing their car, as they felt that on this particular shot she was \"turning the tables of violence back on the men for whom such behavior is considered normal and putting them on the receiving end of violence, a position usually reserved for women\". They noticed that unlike previous Madonna videos which were banned for religious themes or sexuality, MTV found violence as an offence. Even using the remix in the clip changed the song's feminine and bittersweet nature to something faster and harder, adjectives usually reserved for boys. The authors concluded that as always, Madonna inverted the traditional roles and characterization of male and female in the clip."]}, {"page": "Like a Virgin (song)", "response": ["Biographer Andrew Morton noted that most of Madonna's admirers were females, raised with an image of old-fashioned stereotypes of women as virginal brides, as whores, or as having feminist values that rejected using looks for self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. Comparing that image of Madonna with that of Barbie, McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of her idea of femininity, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them. Additionally, according to Morton, at a time when eighties fashions were promoting flat-chested, stick-thin women as ideals of beauty, the more curvaceous Madonna made average girls feel that it was fine to be in the shape they were. A new word called 'Madonna wannabe' was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna's style. University professors, gender-studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post-modernist style and cultural icon. According to author Debbi Voller, \"Like a Virgin\" gave rise to the icon Madonna."]}]}}
