Margaret Oliphant, reviewing the book in Blackwood's Magazine, dismissed it as \"rococo Epicureanism\",Blackwood's Magazine, Nov. 1873 while George Eliot condemned it as \"quite poisonous in its false principles of criticism and false conceptions of life\".George Eliot, letter to John Blackwood, 5 November 1873, quoted in Denis Donoghue's Walter Pater: Lover of Strange Souls (New York, 1995), p.58 In 1874 Pater was turned down at the last moment by his erstwhile mentor Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol, for a previously-promised proctorship. In the 1980s, letters emerged documenting a \"romance\" with a nineteen-year-old Balliol undergraduate, William Money Hardinge, who had attracted unfavorable attention as a result of his outspoken homosexuality and blasphemous verse, and who later became a novelist.

He kept on his desk little squares of paper, each with its ideas, and shuffled them about attempting to form a sequence and pattern. \"I have known writers of every degree, but never one to whom the act of composition was such a travail and an agony as it was to Pater,\" wrote Edmund Gosse, who also described Pater's method of composition: \"So conscious was he of the modifications and additions which would supervene that he always wrote on ruled paper, leaving each alternate line blank.\". He would then make a fair copy and repeat the process, sometimes paying to have drafts printed, to judge their effect. \"Unlike those who were caught by Flaubert's theory of the unique word and the only epithet,\" wrote Osbert Burdett, to . \"Pater sought the sentence, and the sentence in relation to the paragraph, and the paragraph as a movement in the chapter. The numerous parentheses deliberately exchanged a quick flow of rhythm for pauses, for charming little eddies by the way.\" At the height of his powers as a writer, Pater discussed his principles of composition in the 1888 essay \"Style\".
