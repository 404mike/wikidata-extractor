In January 1934, he and Chesterfield's Albert Malam were sent off for a last-minute \"argument\" in which fists were raised. The Sheffield Independent thought the incident regrettable but not worthy of \"such drastic action\"; both men were suspended for a month. Rochdale finished bottom of the Third Division North, and with their Football League status uncertain, released all but three players, of whom Buckley was one. Their application for re-election was successful, and Buckley made 41 appearances in all competitions, a good half of which were in the unaccustomed position of full back. He played 38 games in 1935\u201336, mostly at left half or centre half, as Rochdale changed the makeup of their team on a regular basis, \"sometimes of necessity and more often by choice\", and still finished in 20th place for the second season running."]}, {"page": "Colin Cook (footballer)", "response": ["Following their relegation to the Third Division North, Chesterfield allowed Cook a free transfer, and his last Midland League appearance, in which he scored a hat-trick, was watched by both Herbert Chapman, manager of Arsenal, and by a director of Burnley. However, he agreed to sign on for another season at the club where he was popular with the supporters, and began with a hat-trick in the opening fixture. Cook's two goals in the sixth match, a 3\u20130 win against Rochdale, took him to double figures and Chesterfield to the top of the table, and the People noted that those supporters who had criticised the club for not selecting him enough the previous season might have had a point. With 13 matches gone, he had 14 goals and Chesterfield had set a club record of ten consecutive league wins. His goalscoring continued, though at a lesser rate, and with three matches remaining of the league season, Chesterfield were still top of the table, but only one point ahead of Barnsley. The Halifax Courier pseudonymous \"The Scout\" commented that Barnsley's strength came from their consistent team selection\"if a certain eleven has been fit that eleven has been an automatic choice\"while Chesterfield dropped both Cook and the in-demand Albert Malam, which the writer thought indicated they were becoming \"rattled\". From those last three games, Barnsley took five points and Chesterfield three, so Barnsley were promoted. Cook had scored 28 league goals from his 37 appearances, and reportedly within half-an-hour of being made available on a free transfer, signed for Luton Town of the Third Division South."]}, {"page": "Malam", "response": ["* Albert Malam (1913\u20131992), English football player"]}]}}
