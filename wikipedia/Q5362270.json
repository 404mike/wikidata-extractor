Other TV credits include: Mind Your Language (\"An Inspector Calls\"), Crossroads, Within These Walls, Rising Damp, Angels, Father Dear Father, The Expert, Enemy at the Door, The Setbacks and Rumpole of the Bailey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cricklewood", "response": ["* Elizabeth Adare \u2013 television actress in The Tomorrow People"]}, {"page": "The Tomorrow People", "response": ["The success of the first series saw another 13 episodes go into production quite soon after, but with a number of changes. Off-screen, both Bernard and Finch departed leaving Price to take more control as writer, director and producer, while on-screen Kenny and Carol disappeared (sent to the Galactic Federation's headquarters The Trig to work as ambassadors for Earth). Salmon was simply not asked back as there was a feeling the character had failed to work and his acting was considered wooden (plus Salmon had never been very keen to appear as he had no interest in acting), while Winmill's departure was voluntary as the actress was concerned about being associated with a long running series. In their place came student school teacher Elizabeth M'Bondo, portrayed by Elizabeth Adare. Adare initially thought her character was to be a teenage girl and made every effort at her audition to look and act like an adolescent. However, Price and Boswell were suitably impressed to change the Elizabeth character so that she breaks out at an older age due to a latent puberty. Elizabeth is uncovered by Stephen when working at his school, where she is doing her teacher training. This was the start of a near-annual event where a new TP would be introduced in the first story of each series, a handy way of maintaining interest for returning viewers and a convenient way for Price to re-establish the basic premise of the show for new audiences every year. Adare would stay until the end in 1979 but grew increasingly unhappy with the quality of later scripts. However, she knew how important and ground breaking it was for a black actress to be the female lead in a British TV production, so consciously decided to remain.", "1978 saw changes being made, starting with Elizabeth's absence through most of Series 6 due to Elizabeth Adare's pregnancy (on screen Elizabeth is working on diplomatic missions for the Galactic Federation and appears only briefly on a screen so as to hide the actress's condition). In her place came Hsui Tai, played by Japanese actress Misako Koba, whose poor grasp of English made her hard to understand, and Nicholas Young later recalled that he and other actors found this difficult during production. Koba had no previous acting experience and had been suggested for the role by her actor husband. A new Lab set was introduced with a smaller but now mobile TIM and the jaunting belts were replaced by the rather cheap looking jaunting bands (worn on the wrists). These changes were forced on the production team following a fire at the Thames storerooms. The new Lab acted as both base and home for the Tomorrow People as they were now seen to be sleeping in their own cabins there. It was noticeably smaller than the previous set, which freed up more space in the studio for the designers to utilise on other sets. The 6 episodes were produced sporadically through 1977 (a combination of Price writing scripts as and when it fitted with his other production commitments and a number of strikes at ITV over the year) and finally launched in the Spring of 78. Such was Holoway's popularity that he was featured on the cover of TV Times to promote the start of the season.", "* Elizabeth M'Bondo \u2013 (Elizabeth Adare) Elizabeth is the first addition to the original line-up, introduced at the beginning of the second season. She is a student teacher at Stephen's school and is said to be the same age as John. She often brings a sense of compassion to the Tomorrow People and is one of the few people capable of standing up to John, notably in \"The Doomsday Men\" when she convinces him to save stranded astronaut Lee, as well as facing down several villains. Towards the end of the series, she becomes more involved in galactic affairs and spends a lot of time at the Galactic Trig, including the whole of season six.", "In 2001, Big Finish Productions launched a series of new audio plays based on the original series, produced by Nigel Fairs. Nicholas Young and Philip Gilbert reprised their roles as John and TIM, with Helen Goldwyn and James Daniel Wilson appearing as Elena and Paul, the new Tomorrow People. Some releases also feature other original cast members, such as Peter Vaughan-Clarke, Elizabeth Adare and Mike Holoway (notably Trigonometry). Trevor Littledale took over the role of TIM in the audio series from The Warlock's Dance onwards after Philip Gilbert's death in 2004.", "In October 2005, Fantom Films and First Time Films released the 1997 documentary about the series entitled Beyond Tomorrow. The documentary features interviews with cast members from the original series, including Nicholas Young (John), Peter Vaughan-Clarke (Stephen), Sammie Winmill (Carol), Elizabeth Adare (Liz), Dean Lawrence (Tyso), Mike Holoway (Mike) and Philip Gilbert."]}, {"page": "A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (film)", "response": ["* Elizabeth Adare as Barrister"]}, {"page": "Father, Dear Father (film)", "response": ["*Elizabeth Adare - Maggie"]}, {"page": "List of The Tomorrow People serials", "response": [":Regular Cast: Nicholas Young (John), Peter Vaughan-Clarke (Stephen), Elizabeth Adare (Elizabeth), Chris Chittell (Chris), Philip Gilbert (Voice of TIM)", ":Regular Cast: Nicholas Young (John), Peter Vaughan-Clarke (Stephen), Elizabeth Adare (Elizabeth), Dean Lawrence (Tyso), Philip Gilbert (Voice of TIM)", ":Regular Cast: Nicholas Young (John), Peter Vaughan-Clarke (Stephen), Elizabeth Adare (Elizabeth), Dean Lawrence (Tyso), Philip Gilbert (Voice of TIM), Mike Holoway (Mike Bell)", ":Regular Cast: Nicholas Young (John), Elizabeth Adare (Elizabeth), Mike Holoway (Mike Bell), Philip Gilbert (Voice of TIM)", ":Regular Cast: Nicholas Young (John), Elizabeth Adare (Elizabeth), Mike Holoway (Mike), Misako Koba (Hsui Tai), Nigel Rhodes (Andrew Forbes), Philip Gilbert (Voice of TIM)", ":Regular Cast: Nicholas Young (John), Elizabeth Adare (Elizabeth), Mike Holoway (Mike), Misako Koba (Hsui Tai), Nigel Rhodes (Andrew Forbes), Philip Gilbert (Voice of TIM)"]}, {"page": "Adare (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Elizabeth Adare (born 1949), English actress, television presenter and child psychologist"]}, {"page": "Adare, Elizabeth", "response": ["#redirectElizabeth Adare"]}, {"page": "Zigger Zagger", "response": ["Elizabeth Adare, Stephen Amiel, Robert Bailey, Stephen Boxer, Martin Chamberlain, Henry Chambers, Richard Cleveland, Derek Coates, Roderick Culbertson, Russell Dixon, Thomas Dmochowski, Sydney Dunn, Pearl England, Linda Fitzsimmons, Natalie Fleischer, Michael Ford, Michael Hadley, Peter Hall, Alan Hart, Stephen Hewitt, Peter Jones, Christopher Lacey, Kathleen Lee, Roderick Leyland, Kim Lewis-Lavender, Fergus Logan, Kathleen Lyall, Brian Marcus, James Milne, Barry McCarthy, Brian Payne, Timothy Pembridge, Joan Rees, Judith Riley, Michael Roberts, Nicholas Roth, Sally Sagoe, Lee Simmonds, Paul Spencer, Charles Sturridge, John Sweet, Alan Swift, Robert Thompson, Geoffrey Thorpe, Russell Thorpe, Albert Welling, Brian Wheeler, Stephen Yates."]}]}}
