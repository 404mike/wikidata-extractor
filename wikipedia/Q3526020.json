His cricket coach at Radley was B H Smithson, father of England cricketer Gerald Smithson. While Dexter was head boy at Radley, Peter Cook, English satirist, writer and actor, was among those  younger boys upon whom 'a big & strong' Dexter inflicted corporal punishment. He did his national service as a second lieutenant in the 11th Hussars during the Malayan Emergency in 1953\u201355 and was awarded the Malaya Campaign Medal. Dexter entered Jesus College, Cambridge in October 1955, where he played golf and rugby in addition to winning his cricket Blue and playing in the University Match in 1956, 1957 and (as captain) 1958. He first came to notice as a bowler taking 5/8 and 3/47 for the Gentlemen in 1957 and joined Sussex County Cricket Club in the same year. He made his Test debut in 1958 against New Zealand, made 52 and E.W. Swanton thought that he should have been picked for Peter May's MCC tour of Australia in 1958\u201359. In the end he was flown from Paris (where his wife was working as a model) to reinforce Peter May's injury-struck team. Dexter arrived in the middle of the tour, did not have time to acclimatize and although he did well in the tour matches he failed in the Tests. Continuing on the tour to New Zealand he made 141, his maiden Test century. After an indifferent summer against India the decision to take him to the Caribbean in 1959\u201360 was much criticised, but \"Lord Ted\" made his name thrashing the fast bowlers Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith with his powerful drives. He hit 132 not out in the First Test, 110 in the Fourth Test, made 526 runs (65.75), topping the England batting averages, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1961."]}, {"page": "Bevin Boys", "response": ["*Gerald Smithson, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Gerald Smithson"]}, {"page": "Alan Walker (Australian sportsman)", "response": ["He performed the unusual feat of taking four wickets in four balls for Nottinghamshire against Leicestershire at Leicester in 1956.

The other eight were Allen and seven newcomers: Dennis Brookes, Billy Griffith, Jim Laker, Winston Place, Gerald Smithson, Maurice Tremlett and Johnny Wardle. Playfair was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series. The team, it said, \"could not be called great by any standards\" as it was too \"experimental\" but it at least seemed \"workmanlike\" and in Laker a new star had been discovered.Playfair, p. 11. Playfair ominously concluded its review by reference to the 1948 Australian team being \"about to descend upon us well armed in all key departments (and) we shall have to do better than this\".Playfair, p. 13.", "Yorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper Don Brennan, batsmen Willie Watson and Gerald Smithson, fast bowler Alec Coxon and left arm spinner Johnny Wardle. In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches. Other players included Harry Crick, Harry Halliday, Freddie Jakeman, Geoffrey Keighley and pace bowler John Whitehead.Playfair, pp. 95\u201397."]}, {"page": "Dewsbury and Savile Ground", "response": ["Bertram Harold Smithson, the father of Yorkshire and England cricketer Gerald Smithson, was cricket professional and head groundsman for Dewsbury & Savile CC in the early 1930s."]}, {"page": "Michael Hill (English cricketer)", "response": ["He was educated at Abingdon School where he was coached by ex-England cricketer Gerald Smithson.
