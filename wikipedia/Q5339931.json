He made his Football League debut playing at right half away to Northampton Town on 25 Septemberone of five men tried in that position in the first few weeks of the seasonbut established himself in the team at left half and missed only three matches over the rest of the campaign. In 1921\u201322, he did not appear until the new year, but did help the team reach the last 16 of the FA Cup. He left Swansea at the end of the season for Second Division club Bury, where he spent a year without first-team football before returning to the Southern Section with Northampton Town. He was unwell at the start of the 1923\u201324 season, and although he played in the reserves, he did not make his first-team debut until late December, standing in for the rested Frank Newton. He kept his place for the next match, and made nine more appearances as injury cover before the half-back line was rearranged to accommodate the return of regular centre-half Edmund Wood. An unsuccessful trial with Durham City in October 1924, during which he played twice in the Third Division North as a centre forward, put an end to his Football League career. He had a trial with Scottiah League club Clydebank, and played for Junior club Yoker Athletic before returning to England with Rushden Town."]}]}}
