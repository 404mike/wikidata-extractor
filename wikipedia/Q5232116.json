The most recent were a new concerto 'River of Crystal Light' by Peter Lieuwen, which he played and recorded in the Texas Festival in June 2005 and a clarinet quintet, 'The Sun and the Moon' by Michael Stimpson which received its premiere in Aberystwyth with the RT\u00c9 Vanbrugh Quartet in July 2005. In February 2006 David played concertos by Mozart and Charles Fitts (World Premiere) in the USA with the Houston Chamber Orchestra.\nAs well as numerous broadcasts over the past thirty years, David has made many CDs including two versions of the Mozart Clarinet Concerto with the City of London Sinfonia and Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, two versions of the \u0392rahms Clarinet Sonatas as well as the Mozart and Brahms Quintets, Messiaen Quartet for the End of Time, two albums of music by Charles Camilleri, the Bliss Clarinet Quintet, Philip Cannon's Quintet, Logos and works by Martinu, Peter Maxwell Davies and Carey Blyton.  His recording of Peter Lieuwen's 'River of Crystal Light' was released in May 2007 and future projects include recording a third CD of works by Charles Camilleri and an album of English clarinet quintets, and concertos by Carl Davis, Gerald Finzi and Graham Fitkin in Estonia with the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra.\nDavid Campbell particularly enjoys the genre of the Clarinet Quintet and has appeared as a guest artist with the Bingham String Quartet, Bridge String Quartet, Brodsky String Quartet, Copenhagen String Quartet (Denmark), Coull String Quartet, Danubius String Quartet (Hungary), Delme String Quartet, Emperor String Quartet, Endellion String Quartet, Fine Arts String Quartet (USA), Maggini String Quartet, Medici String Quartet, Solstice String Quartet and Tippett String Quartet.
