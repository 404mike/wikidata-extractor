At first she lived with her mother, her mother's stepsister, Mary Shelley, and Mary's husband Percy Bysshe Shelley. When she was fifteen months old, she was turned over to Byron, who changed her name to Allegra. Byron placed her with foster families and later in a Roman Catholic convent, where she died at the age of five of typhus or malaria.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1822", "response": ["* April 20 \u2013 Allegra Byron, illegitimate daughter of Lord Byron (b. 1817)"]}, {"page": "William Godwin", "response": ["The eldest was Fanny Imlay (1794\u20131816), who committed suicide as a young woman. Charles Gaulis Clairmont ended up as Chair of English literature at Vienna University and taught sons of the royal family; news of his sudden death in 1849 distressed Maximilian. Mary Godwin (1797\u20131851) gained fame as Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein. Half a year younger than her was Claire Clairmont, Mary Jane's only daughter, to whom she showed favouritism. The youngest, and the only child of the second marriage, was William Godwin the Younger (1803\u20131832). Godwin sent him first to Charterhouse School and then to various other establishments of a practical bent. Nonetheless, he eventually earned his living by the pen. He died at 29, leaving the manuscript of a novel, which Godwin saw into print. All of Godwin's children who lived into adulthood worked as writers or educators, carrying on his legacy and that of his wives. Only two of them had children who in turn survived: Percy Florence Shelley, and the son and daughter of Charles. Godwin did not welcome the birth of Allegra Byron, but Claire's only child died aged five."]}, {"page": "Claire Clairmont", "response": ["thumb|left|Clara Allegra Byron, about 1822"]}, {"page": "St Mary's Church, Harrow on the Hill", "response": ["Lord Byron was a frequent visitor as a schoolboy from Harrow school, from 1801 to 1805, and he sat dreaming by \"his favourite tombstone\" (the \"Peachey Tomb\"), as recorded in \"Lines Written beneath an Elm in the Churchyard of Harrow\", which is reproduced on a memorial in front of the Peachey Tomb, erected by the son of one of Byron's school friends in 1905.
