He was also one of three players internally disciplined by the club for an unspecified incident at a hotel; the other two players were Ryan Hall and Kane Ferdinand. Despite these setbacks he still found the net 12 times in 37 games in 2011\u201312. Dickinson left Roots Hall at the expiry of his contract on 20 June, after the \"Shrimpers\" were unwilling renew his contract for a further year."]}, {"page": "Brian McDermott (rugby league)", "response": ["By coincidence, on 12 April 2013 Leeds United announced their new manager as Brian McDermott, meaning that both the rugby league and football teams in the city of Leeds had managers with the same name.

He suffered an ankle injury following Southend's 2\u20132 draw against Swindon Town in February 2010, and subsequently missed two months of the season. He made 41 appearances during the 2009\u201310 campaign, in a season that witnessed Southend suffer relegation back to League Two following financial difficulties. Despite the club's relegation, he remained at Southend for the 2010\u201311 season, with Southend under new management in the form of Paul Sturrock. Grant ended his 79-game goal drought shortly into the new campaign when he scored a 25-yard strike in a 2\u20130 away victory against Bradford City. A week later, he doubled his goal tally for the season when he \"stroked home\" Ryan Hall's inswinging corner in a 2\u20131 home victory over Torquay United, thus ending Torquay's winning start to the season. He went on to score in the club's next two matches; a 2\u20131 defeat to Northampton Town, and a 35-yard strike in the club's 3\u20132 home loss to Morecambe, consequently taking his tally to four goals in as many matches. Grant soon scored his fifth of the campaign, scoring a low driven effort in an away defeat to Chesterfield on 9 October 2010. He also netted in a 1\u20131 draw with Shrewsbury Town at the New Meadow a month later, scoring a \"stunning volley\" late-on to rescue a point for Southend. As a result of Grant's impressive form during the first half of the season, he attracted interest from a number of Championship clubs, but later issued a statement stating his intention to see out the remainder of his contract at Southend. He scored two further goals during the season; finishing \"calmly\" from inside the area in a 2\u20130 win against Barnet in January 2011, as well as netting against Wycombe Wanderers on the last day of the season. He ended the season having scored eight goals in 51 appearances, with Southend finishing in mid-table."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Football League Two", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Ryan Hall "]}, {"page": "Chris Lewington", "response": ["Lewington began the season with a clean sheet in Dagenham's 1\u20130 win against Macclesfield Town on 6 August, despite being sent off late on after a deliberate handball. After completing his ban, Lewington established himself as first-choice goalkeeper over Shea, recording three clean sheets in his first four matches, with teammate Damian Scannell describing him as \"the best keeper in this division in this division and the division above [League One]\". Scannell also added that Sam Walker, whose solid performance in goal for Northampton Town helped the Cobblers to a 2\u20131 win over the Daggers on 24 September, was \"not better than Chris Lewington\". John Still added that he expected a lot of interest from other clubs in his goalkeeper, following further good performances, including a second-half penalty save from Ryan Hall in their 3\u20131 defeat to the Shrimpers in the Football League Trophy on 4 October. After making 19 league appearances, Lewington signed a new three-year deal on 1 November. On the back of Lewington's form, Arsenal decided to recall James Shea from his season-long loan with Dagenham, with the stopper only making five appearances between August and December."]}, {"page": "Connor Ripley", "response": ["He then went out on an emergency loan to Oxford United, after both their goalkeepers had suffered injuries. Ripley made his only appearance for Oxford United, in which he conceded a goal from Ryan Hall's free kick, in a 2\u20130 loss against Southend United the next day. After this, manager Chris Wilder was unhappy with Ripley's performance and decided to terminate his loan spell at the club. After returning to Middlesbrough, Ripley became the third-choice goalkeeper around the 2012\u201313 season and in January 2013 signed a new contract with the club."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Football League Two", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Ryan Hall"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Southend United F.C. season", "response": ["|Ryan Hall", "|Ryan Hall"]}, {"page": "Dominic Poleon", "response": ["Poleon made his first start for Leeds United in a league game against Nottingham Forest on 22 September after impressing as a substitute in a 2\u20133 league defeat against Hull City earlier in the week. He marked the occasion with his first professional goal in the 25th minute. Prior to the game against Forest, Neil Warnock had questioned Poleon's work ethic and approach to the game, saying that he risked his career 'fizzling out' if he didn't change his attitude. He likened Poleon's attitude to his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at Crystal Palace, Victor Moses, who would prove to increase his application before joining Premier League side Wigan Athletic in \u00a32.5m deal in 2010 and reigning UEFA Champions League winners Chelsea for a fee of around \u00a39m two years later. The imminent loan signing of another of Warnock's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and Moses' former teammate at Palace, Ryan Hall, would further limit Poleon's first-team opportunities at United as he would look to gain valuable playing experience from a loan spell in the lower leagues."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Southend United F.C. season", "response": ["|Ryan Hall"]}]}}
