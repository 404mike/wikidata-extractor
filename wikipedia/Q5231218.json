Barrow's team affairs were shifted to players Paul Jones, David Bayliss and Darren Sheridan.

Hulbert stated leading with elbows is \"just a part of his game\" \u2013 leaving Griffin needing stitches around his left eye, a broken nose and broken cheekbone. Barrow manager Darren Sheridan defended Hulbert on Radio 5 Live, saying \"he's not that sort of player\". He was restricted to twenty appearances in 2010\u201311 due to suspension and a groin injury.
