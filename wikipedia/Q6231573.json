His preaching was noted as being exceptionally powerful, \"as if talking fire down from heaven\". On one occasion it is said he preached to a crowd of 10,000 people. He was a strict High-Calvinist who believed in the literal truth of the Bible. At one stage he argued strongly for the doctrine of election. He came to be known as Y Pab Methodistaidd in Welsh (The Methodist Pope) because of his forthright views. Despite his wide interests, he was a religious conservative who opposed all forms of political Radicalism as well as the assertion, popular at the time amongst Nonconformists in Wales, that \"the voice of the people was the voice of God\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Llangefni", "response": ["* John Elias, preacher, lived in the town 1830\u201341"]}, {"page": "John Jones", "response": ["*John Elias (born John Jones, 1774\u20131841), Welsh preacher"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*John Elias (1774\u20131841)"]}, {"page": "1904\u20131905 Welsh revival", "response": ["The last previous revival in Wales was in 1859, but this followed other developments.

The sport continued to be played until the second half of the nineteenth century, but was beginning to be replaced by other sports. The game survived in the Aberavon area until the death of Theodore Talbot, the captain of the Margam Bando Boys in 1876. Talbot, the son of Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot and heir to the Margam Estate was a supporter of the sport, and his death coincided with the coming of the Mansel, Avon Vale and Taibach tinworks.
