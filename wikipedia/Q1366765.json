They include Greenland or other places in or across the Atlantic, the former Roman fort of Aballava in Cumbria, Bardsey Island off the coast of Wales, the isle of \u00cele Aval on the coast of Pleumeur-Bodou in Brittany, and Lady's Island in Leinster. Geoffrey Ashe championed an association of Avalon with the town of Avallon in Burgundy, as part of a theory connecting King Arthur to the Romano-British leader Riothamus who was last seen in that area. Robert Graves identified Avalon with the Spanish island of Majorca (Mallorca), while Laurence Gardner suggested the Isle of Arran off the coast of Scotland. "]}, {"page": "Lady of the Lake", "response": ["Further theories connect her to the Welsh lake fairies known as the Gwragedd Annwn (including a Lady of the Lake unrelated to the legend of Arthur), the Romano-British water goddess Coventina (Covienna), and the North Caucasian Satanaya (Satana) from the Nart sagas. Associated with water, Satana helps the Scythian hero Batraz gain his magic sword. Possible prototypes include Guendoloena and Ganieda, respectively Merlin's one-time wife and his sister from Geoffrey of Monmouth's Vita Merlini, besides the Roman goddess of the hunt and the nature, Diana, the spiritual descent from whom is actually explicitly stated within the French prose narratives. Laurence Gardner interpreted the Arthurian romances' stated Biblical origins of Lancelot's bloodline by noting the belief about Jesus' purported wife Mary Magdalene's later life in Gaul (today's France) and her death at Aquae Sextiae; he identified her descendant as the 6th-century Comtess of Avallon named Viviane del Acqs (\"of the water\"), whose three daughters (respectively the mothers of Lancelot, of Arthur, and of Gawain) would thus evolve into being known as the Ladies of the Lake."]}, {"page": "Ancient astronauts", "response": ["* 1999: Laurence Gardner (book, Genesis of the Grail Kings: The Explosive Story of Genetic Cloning)"]}, {"page": "Sir Laurence Gardner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Laurence Gardner"]}, {"page": "Jaz Coleman", "response": ["On 22 March, Sir Laurence Gardner's book Secrets of the Lost Ark, which expounds on anti-gravity and prehistory, was published.
