He achieved stage success in the early part of the 20th century with a comedy magic act and is also notable as the first magician to appear on a regularly scheduled television show.\nCulpitt got his first big break when the American \"chinese-style\" magician Chung Ling Soo booked him for a tour of Australia in 1909. Between 1914 and 1918 Culpitt replaced David Devant at St. George's Hall, London, performing as a \"magical comedian\".Culpitt is credited with inventing the Doll's House Illusion, the Costume Trunk Illusion and the Silk To Egg Trick, which continue to be used by magicians. He is also credited with devising methods for the Torn and restored newspaper trick and various other effects that have become a part of the stage magic repertoire.In 1936 the BBC began test broadcasts from Alexandra Palace, London, for the world's first regular television service. In an effort to find material that would work well on the new medium the corporation sought entertainment acts that had a strong visual element. Culpitt was recruited to present magic, thus helping to establish a lasting place for magic in television variety programming.Also in 1936, Culpitt appeared in the film Keep Your Seats, Please, which starred George Formby. According to the British Film Catalogue, Culpitt, in a small supporting role, played a magician.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sawing a woman in half", "response": ["The question of who was the first woman to be sawn in half has received much less publicity than the question of which magician first presented the illusion. According to Jim Steinmeyer the woman who participated in the December 1920 demonstration was Jan Glenrose, who was Selbit's main assistant at that time and who was also the partner of magician Fred Culpitt. In the public performance the role of victim was taken by principal assistant Betty Barker."]}, {"page": "Magic (illusion)", "response": ["As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included Okito, David Devant, Harry Blackstone Sr., Harry Blackstone Jr., Howard Thurston, Theodore Annemann, Cardini, Joseph Dunninger, Dai Vernon, Fred Culpitt, Tommy Wonder, Siegfried & Roy, and Doug Henning. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include David Copperfield, Lance Burton, James Randi, Penn and Teller, David Blaine, Criss Angel, Hans Klok, Derren Brown and Dynamo. Well-known women magicians include Dell O'Dell and Dorothy Dietrich. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production visual effects."]}]}}
