Sharon and Dennis marry on 29 August 2005; during their reception, however, Sam is arrested for digging up Den's body to incriminate Chrissie; however, Sam is charged with Den's murder. Her brothers, Phil and Grant, return weeks later to convince Sharon of Chrissie's guilt. Sharon and Grant resolve their past grievances, as do Dennis and Phil, and the four work together with Peggy to bring Chrissie to justice. Sharon tries to persuade Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) to change Zoe\u2019s alibi, but to no avail. Eventually, Phil and Grant manage to extract a tape of Chrissie confessing to Den's murder - thus proving her guilty to the police. While Sam would later be released from prison, Sharon personally confronts Chrissie just as she attempts to flee the country and punches her to avenge her father's death; Chrissie is then arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, the Mitchell's victory is cut short when Sam is forced to flee the country after discovering that she will likely be detained for perverting the course of justice in Den's murder.

Sharon persuades Dennis to leave after confiding in Phil about Johnny's threat. Phil, seeking to get one over Johnny before the end of 2005, later informs Dennis about the threat after telling him that Johnny killed his best-friend Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs). At first Dennis refuses to submit to Phil's temptation in confronting Johnny about Andy's murder, but relents after Phil describes the way how Johnny threatened Sharon earlier on.

While Sharon talks to Kathy, she realises that Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey), the solicitor who arranged her adoption and who she has been visiting to track her father, is Gavin's sister. When Gavin wakes up, Sharon asks about her adoption; Gavin says he had a fling with Carol Hanley (Sheila White), who had a breakdown after Sharon's birth, and Gavin was not paternal but Den was, so he traded Sharon for part in a bank raid that Den was working on.

Carl Greenwood from the Daily Mirror said that \"Two huge EastEnders storylines could be set to converge\" if Gavin is Sharon's father. An EastEnders source said: \"Eagle-eyed viewers will spot police are in the same area as Sharon was looking for her dad\". Brown later said that it would \"be a treat\" to see Gavin revealed as Sharon's father, as it would also make him the grandfather of Dennis \"Denny\" Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau), Sharon's son with Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), and said \"Something tells me that Gavin wouldn't be cheery grandpa offering up the Werther's Originals to Denny while they watch the Antiques Roadshow together. More likely, he'd be getting him down Basher Jim's for a bit of boxing training before introducing him into his criminal empire.\" However, All About Soap wondered if Phil had actually sent Sharon to a fake address. Amy Duncan from the Metro said, \"perhaps there are just two Gavins with links to Albert Square living in Notting Hill.\" Duncan Lindsay from the Metro wondered if Phil might know that Gavin is Sharon's father, which is why he did not want Sharon to track down her real father and also speculated that Gavin could be related to the character Dan Sullivan, who was played by Craig Fairbrass between 1999 and 2001 and was one of Phil's enemies."]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders characters (2016)", "response": ["| A drug dealer who Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) owes money to.
