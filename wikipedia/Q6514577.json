County again took an early lead through Nat Jarvis in the 13th minute but lost the game 3\u20132 to give Bath only their third victory of the season. That loss pushed County back to the brink of the relegation zone, only staying out on goal difference. Away to Luton Town County lost 2\u20130 after debutant Ryan Charles was sent off after 32 minutes. After a home 0\u20130 draw with Forest Green Rovers County made the long trip to Gateshead. Finding themselves 2\u20130 down after 53 minutes Elliot Buchanan pulled a goal back in the 57th minute. As the game drew to a close another County defeat looked likely. However County were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute. Sam Foley's spot-kick was initially saved but he was quick to tap in the rebound. The comeback was complete in the 94th minute when substitute Jake Harris scored a 20-yard winner. Despite the victory County had now slipped back into the relegation zone. County's next game saw a return to Stockport County's Edgeley Park for the first time since January 1988. Finding themselves 1\u20130 behind after just seven minutes Andy Sandell equalised in the 50th minute before being sent off just eight minutes later. After Daniel Rowe grabbed his second of the game just minutes later the hosts were back in front with Newport a man down. As the clock ticked towards full-time Jake Harris scored the equaliser in the 87th minute having only been on the pitch for nine minutes. The next game saw a 1\u20130 revenge victory at home over Bath City. County had now left the relegation zone and leapt four places to 17th in the table. The following game saw another 1\u20130 revenge victory, this time against high-flying Mansfield Town. That victory took County to 16th in the table \u2013 the highest they had been since August. In the next game away at Tamworth County took an early lead through a 6th-minute Sam Foley penalty. As the game entered the final minutes this looked to be the third straight County victory but Tamworth equalised in the 83rd minute. Two minutes later and the hosts had won it, the final score a 2\u20131 County defeat. After an away 1\u20131 draw at Southport County were at home to mid-table Braintree Town. After only seven minutes on the clock Lee Minshull was sent off. County eventually lost 4\u20133 having played 83 minutes of normal time and 12 minutes of stoppage time with only ten men. By this point in the season County knew they had made the FA Trophy Final at Wembley but were still in danger of relegation. Away at Cambridge United County trailed 1\u20130 until Andy Sandell scored a penalty five minutes from time to earn County a 1\u20131 draw. Next up was a first trip to Lincoln City's Sincil Bank since the Third Division encounter in October 1985. The game was lost 2\u20130 and County found themselves just one place and one point above the relegation zone. County achieved their second double of the season in the next game, beating Gateshead 1\u20130 at home, but were still only one place and one point above relegation. The next game was the first of the three encounters with promotion hopefuls York City. County won 2\u20131. The third home game in a week resulted in a 0\u20130 draw against Telford United to take seven points out of the nine available. Away to Kidderminster Harriers Jake Reid scored for County within 10 seconds of kick-off and Sam Foley doubled the lead on 36 minutes. With full-time approaching Elliot Buchanan gave away a penalty in the 86th minute. Substitute Nick Wright duly converted it and full-time was up. However, in a disastrous spell of injury time Wright scored Kidderminster's equaliser in the 93rd minute and then the winner in the 95th minute for his hat-trick. The next game was the second of three games against York City. County again started well with Nat Jarvis scoring in the 4th minute. York equalised in the 59th minute and the game ended a 1\u20131 draw. County now knew that they only needed a point against relegated Darlington to secure league safety barring some statistically improbable results elsewhere. That point came with a 0\u20130 draw. Any doubts that County were now safe were extinguished by the following 1\u20130 victory over Alfreton Town. Manager Justin Edinburgh had achieved his aim of avoiding relegation. The final two league games of the season, results now immaterial, were a home 1\u20130 loss to second-placed Wrexham and a 3\u20131 loss to Barrow.", "|30||MF||align=\"left\"| Lee Minshull||17 (0)||1||4 (0)||0||21 (0)||1", "|13 Jan 2012||DF|| Lee Minshull||AFC Wimbledon||13 Jan 2012", "|FW ||30 || Lee Minshull"]}, {"page": "2011 Conference Premier play-off Final", "response": ["|MF ||14 ||Lee Minshull  ||  || "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 AFC Wimbledon season", "response": ["|14 || ||MF ||Lee Minshull || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0", "| align=\"center\" |  Lee Minshull", "| align=\"center\" |  Lee Minshull"]}, {"page": "2012 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|FW ||30 || Lee Minshull"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Newport County A.F.C. season", "response": ["The first fixture of the new year was the home visit of Forest Green Rovers.

The next match at home to Wrexham ended in a 1\u20131 draw, which was enough to put Wrexham top of the table, with County staying 3rd, one point behind. County rose to 2nd in the table following the 4\u20132 away win at Lincoln City, with d\u00e9butant Robbie Willmott scoring a brace. With momentum in their favour County were desperate to get the home match with bottom-placed Barrow on, but the Rodney Parade pitch was under several feet of snow on the morning of 19 January. Over 120 fans helped to clear the pitch but County went on to lose 2\u20130. Following that setback, Newport then went on a seven-match unbeaten run, including completing the double over Mansfield Town and Hereford United in the process. The Hereford match being particularly notable for the award of three penalties to Hereford, two of which were scored. In the following match a 90th-minute winner for Kidderminster Harriers resulted in them being the only team to complete double victories over County and move into top place in the table as a result. The next game resulted in a second consecutive County defeat away at Stockport County \u2014 Stockport winning 1\u20130 as a result of a Lee Minshull own goal.

Newport finished their home season with victories over Macclesfield Town and Alfreton Town, the latter of which was played in torrential rain with large pools of standing water. The penultimate game of the season was a 2\u20132 away draw with Luton Town with the final game against fellow play-off contenders Grimsby Town.
