On Westbrook's last audition, she and the other hopefuls were forced to stand for a lengthy period in front of a panel of the show's producers, directors and writers while they continuously compared images of the auditionees to images of Kemp and McFadden, looking for a resemblance. Westbrook was given the part. She has commented, \"they told me they were looking for someone bright and bubbly, who could be the sister of Phil and Grant, and my round face fitted.\" In the character's first scene, Sam walked past Ricky Butcher and gave him a \"flirty backward glance\", causing him to walk into a lamp-post.

We were seriously told off that day.\" She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, Letitia Dean, Adam Woodyatt and Nick Berry like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as June Brown, Wendy Richard, Mike Reid and Gillian Taylforth.
