Doran was highly praised by manager Terry Butcher after the 3\u20130 defeat of Rangers on Halloween 2012, in the 2012\u201313 League Cup quarter-finals. \"If you give Aaron Doran space he'll utilise it, he'll expose teams and expose space, he's a good passer and a good supplier. He doesn't score a lot but what he does do is create a lot.\" After a good November, which included wins against Kilmarnock, Celtic and Aberdeen, Doran, along with Butcher and McKay, won the SPL Monthly awards. In mid-December, Doran announced he wanted to stay at the club and that he hoped Butcher would offer him a new contract. In April, Butcher announced that Doran was close to signing a new contract, along with his colleague, David Raven. At the end of the season, the speculation finally ended when Doran signed a new three-year contract with the club."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Professional Football League monthly award winners", "response": ["| Billy McKay(Inverness CT)"]}, {"page": "2014 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["In the third round Inverness CT faced an away tie against Scottish Championship team Dundee.
