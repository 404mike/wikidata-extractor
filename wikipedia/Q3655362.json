Kennedy, Syme and Dachuan Yu also formalized this widely used system.He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, and is a member of the WG2.8 working group on functional programming. He is a co-author of the book Expert F# 3.0.In the past he also worked on formal specification, interactive proof, automated verification and proof description languages.In 2015, he was honored with a Silver Medal from the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeline of programming languages", "response": ["| Don Syme, Microsoft Research"]}, {"page": "F Sharp (programming language)", "response": ["The language evolution process is managed by Don Syme from Microsoft Research as the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) for the language design, together with the F# Software Foundation.", "F# originates from Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK.
