He returned to regular cricket in 1964, however, and with 788 runs and 64 wickets had his best all-round season; he also took 36 catches. Against Derbyshire he made an unbeaten 88, batting at No 8. In the next game, against Worcestershire, he was promoted to bat at No 3 and made 91, and this was to be his highest first-class score. In that match against Worcestershire, however, other spin bowlers Malcolm Scott and David Steele bowled 35 overs each in Worcestershire's first innings, while Watts bowled only three. The following season, 1965, that was increasingly the pattern: Watts was played largely for his useful batting and his number of overs bowled and his total of wickets both more than halved. In some compensation, he scored 852 runs at an average of 25.81, with six half-centuries, though the highest was just 64. In 1966, however, Mushtaq Mohammad was available for County Championship cricket for Northamptonshire as a high-class batsman and leg-break and googly bowler; Watts played until early June, but then was dropped to the second eleven and left the county at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Malcolm Scott (disambiguation)", "response": ["Malcolm Scott (1911\u20131989) was an Australian politician.", "Malcolm Scott may also refer to:", "*Malcolm Scott (Australian footballer) (1958\u20132017), Australian rules football player", "*Malcolm Scott (English cricketer) (1936\u20132020), English cricketer and footballer", "*Malcolm Scott (South African cricketer) (born 1947), South African cricketer", "*Malcolm Scott (American football) (born 1961), American football player", "*Malcolm Scott (entertainer) (1872\u20131929), English comic entertainer and female impersonator", "*John Scott (sailor) (John Malcolm Scott, born 1934), Australian Olympic silver medal-winning sailor", "*Malcolm Scott, musician in The New Grand", "*Malcolm Scott, character in 6,000 Enemies"]}, {"page": "Keith Robinson (cricketer)", "response": ["While serving in the Royal Navy, Robinson played a single first-class cricket match for the Combined Services cricket team against Northamptonshire in 1961 at Northampton.
