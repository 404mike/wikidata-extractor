In July 2002, the release of English musician George Michael's song \"Shoot the Dog\" proved to be controversial. It was critical of George W. Bush and Tony Blair in the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The video showed a cartoon version of Michael astride a nuclear missile in the Middle East and Tony and Cherie Blair in bed with President Bush. The Dixie Chicks are an American country music band. During a London concert ten days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines said, \"we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States [George W. Bush] is from Texas\".Film:Shut up and Sing The positive reaction to this statement from the British audience contrasted with the boycotts that ensued in the U.S., where \"the band was assaulted by talk-show conservatives\", while their albums were discarded in public protest. The original music video for the title song from American pop singer Madonna's American Life album was banned as music television stations thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. She also made her widely considered \"comeback\" album with her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor which topped the charts worldwide in a record 40 countries. As of 2016 the album has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide.

The ground floor of Lynda Grier was originally student accommodation but in 2006 it was converted into a law library, which was opened that year by Cherie Blair. The library was of great importance when founded as women (remarkably) were not permitted to use the Bodleian Library, and thus is relatively large for an Oxford college. The Briggs room originally contained the entire archive of rare and antiquarian books donated to the college over the years. However, due to its size of around 2,000 books, the archive is now stored in the Lawrence Lacerte Rare Books Room in the new Law Library extension on the ground floor.

He said he did so, in common with many others, to persuade Labour unequivocally to back a People's Vote.  Two days later, by email, he was expelled from the Party, a move which provoked a major media storm in which many other Labour members outed themselves as having voted for parties other than Labour, including Cherie Blair, Charles Clarke, Bob Ainsworth and Betty Boothroyd. A hashtag #ExpelMeToo trended on Twitter as ordinary members expressed their support for Campbell. He immediately appealed the decision, saying tactical voting was not a breach of the rule under which he had been expelled, and arguing that unless all others who had acted as he did were expelled he also had a case for discrimination. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson condemned the expulsion as \"spiteful\" and a number of senior MPs immediately called for the decision to be reversed, and an amnesty of all who voted against Labour in the European elections."]}, {"page": "2DTV", "response": ["* Jan Ravens \u2013 Cherie Blair, Ann Widdecombe, Queen Elizabeth, Camilla Parker Bowles, Princess Anne, Fergie, Geri Halliwell, Victoria Beckham, Anne Robinson, Jordan, Heather Graham, Natasha Kaplinsky, Erin Brockovich, Amy Adams, Bj\u00f6rk, Wendy Wilson, Carol \"Smiley\" Smillie, Natasha Richardson, Jennifer Lopez, Lindsay Lohan, Rita Wilson, Kate Middleton, Madonna, Davina McCall, Kylie Minogue, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, Jade Goody, Andie MacDowell, Kim Woodburn, Aggie MacKenzie, Nigella Lawson, Dina Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Queen Mother, Judy Finnigan, Angelina Jolie, Sandra Bullock, Daryl Hannah, Sally Field, Diane Keaton", "* Kate O'Sullivan \u2013 Cherie Blair, Queen Elizabeth, Camilla Parker Bowles, Julia Roberts, Princess Anne, Geri Halliwell, Victoria Beckham, Anne Robinson, Jordan, Carol \"Smiley\" Smillie, Natalie Imbruglia, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Tina Fey, Emma Roberts, Davina McCall, Kylie Minogue, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, Kim Woodburn, Aggie MacKenzie, Nigella Lawson, Kirstie Allsopp, Jennifer Garner, Trinny Woodall, Lisa Ann Walter, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Susannah Constantine, Judy Finnigan, Andre Agassi, Jamie Lee Curtis, Steffi Graf, Helena Bonham Carter, Elaine Hendrix, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Missi Pyle, Judi Dench, Rita Wilson, Coleen McLoughlin"]}, {"page": "Cherie Booth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cherie Blair"]}, {"page": "Hutton Inquiry", "response": ["The notoriety of the Hutton Report received a boost when Cherie Blair was reported to have auctioned off a signed copy of the report for \u00a3400 for the benefit of the Labour Party in May 2006."]}, {"page": "Bury, Greater Manchester", "response": ["* Cherie Blair, barrister and wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair"]}, {"page": "Robert Harris (novelist)", "response": ["In 2007, after Blair resigned, Harris dropped his other work to write The Ghost.
