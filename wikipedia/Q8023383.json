Lines played seven games for Small Heath in the inaugural 1889\u201390 season of the Football Alliance, covering a variety of forward positions, but was unable to displace the established forwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1889\u201390 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Small Heath opened the Football Alliance campaign with a win. They took an early two-goal lead against Birmingham St George's at Coventry Road, and although Saints equalised before the interval and had the better of the second half, Chris Charsley's goalkeeping and Fred Speller's defence kept the Heathens in the game, and Will Devey took advantage of a goalkeeping error for the winning goal. During the reserve team match played the same day, a young opponent was kneed in the abdomen; he died of his injuries two days later in Birmingham General Hospital.Fatal Accident in the Football Field. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 10 September 1889. Walter Gittins and Wilton Lines made their debuts at home to Bootle in front of a large crowd, attracted by Bootle's success in holding \"the Invincibles\"\u00a0\u2013 Preston North End, champions of the Football League, who had gone through the inaugural season unbeaten\u00a0\u2013 to a draw in a friendly match. Small Heath came out of the match with a 2\u20132 draw, with goals from Devey and Eddy Stanley in the first 12 minutes of the game. Bootle scored once before Thomas Davenport narrowly failed to increase Heath's lead when he headed against the crossbar, and after Bootle tied the scores, the defence of both sides worked hard to keep the scores tied. For the third Alliance match in succession, Small Heath let slip a lead, as their visit to Walsall Town Swifts finished at one goal apiece, and September ended with a 3\u20131 defeat of Burslem Port Vale in a \"somewhat dull\" friendly."]}]}}
