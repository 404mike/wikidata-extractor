Rhodes are the authors of Interpreting British Governance (2003) and Governance Stories (2006). They argue that political science must necessarily be an interpretive art.  This is because they hold that the starting point of enquiry must be to unpack the meanings, beliefs, and preferences of actors in order to then make sense of understanding actions, practices, and institutions.  Political science is therefore an interpretative discipline underpinned by hermeneutic philosophy rather than positivism: there is no \u2018science\u2019 of politics, instead all explanations, including those that deploy statistics and models, are best conceived as narratives.  Bevir and Rhodes thus provide an elaborate philosophical foundation for a decentred theory of governance woven together by the notions of beliefs, traditions and dilemmas. 'It follows that the role of political scientists is to use (1) ethnography to uncover people's beliefs and preferences, and (2) history to uncover traditions as they develop in response to dilemmas.  The product is a story of other people's constructions of what they are doing, which provides actors\u2019 views on changes in government, the economy, and society.  So, for example, a political scientist may select a part of the governance process, and then explain it by unpicking various political traditions and how actors within these traditions encounter and act to resolve dilemmas.  Governance is thus understood as the contingent and unintended outcome of competing narratives of governance.\u2019", "* Mark Bevir and Rhodes, R. A. W. (Eds.)

Here, Skinner attacks what he describes as two \"orthodoxies\": \"perennialism\", the view that philosophers have always debated the same fundamental questions; and the notion that context is irrelevant to a historical understanding of texts, which can be read as self-standing material.Skinner, p. 3.

Friedrich Engels, Marx's collaborator, \"censured Hyndman's Mazzinian moralism\" and also accused Hyndman of \"jingo aspiration\". Seamus Flaherty argues that \"Hyndman's views on the beneficence of the 'great democracies of the English speaking peoples'\" were inspired not by Benjamin Disraeli as historians such as Mark Bevir have argued, but rather by Dilke and Mill, whom Hyndman combined their ideas \"on the unique character of 'the Angloe-Saxon race' with Mazzini's cosmopolitan patriotism, thus constructing a nationalism fully compatible with 'a good internationalism'.Flaherty, Seamus (2020).

Originally dedicated to political propaganda, Frank Kitz later recalled how the Rose Street Club gave hospitality, food, shelter, and advice on what the near future might bring their newly-arrived compatriots. According to Mark Bevir, the club was a mixture of \"fun, education and politics\". Between 14 and 20 July 1881, the Rose Street club was the setting for a series of conferences organised by a chapter of the International Working People's Association, the International Workingman's Association, although the IWA's activities were very little increased by these meetings. Other speakers and organisations that visited the Club included brothers Charles and James Murray, who led a discussion of the poetry of Shelley, with reference to his views on the Irish, and Henry Hyndman. At one point, Hyndman expressed interest in the Rose Street Club forming the basis of an official Democratic Party, and a meeting to discuss that proposal was held on 2 March 1881, which comprised a significant cross-section of radical thinkers of the age. Although a resolution was passed which emphasised the importance of forming of a new, broader, party, the proposal came to nothing, and no minutes or other records of how the discussions proceeded have survived. Also in regular attendance at the Club were the members of the Manhood Suffrage League. In 1882 the French Section of the Rose Street Club split off and moved to new premises. In 1881 the Club held a joint mass-meeting with the Labour Emancipation League on Mile End Waste condemning the government's policy of providing financial assistance to encourage the unemployed to emigrate. In July 1883, it was a signatory to the Manifesto of the World, issued by the Social Democratic club. The Club also organised, and became the headquarters of, the defence committee\u2014called the English Revolutionary Society\u2014supporting Johann Most against his prosecution in April 1881, led by radicals F. W. Soutter and Dr G. B. Clark. The committee  New-York Tribune described how Most had been \"locked up promptly at the time of his arrest\", and had subsequently been charged with publishing what they called \"a scandalous, malicious and immoral libel, justifying assassination and murder, inciting persons to conspire against the lives of the sovereigns and rulers of Europe\". Although the campaign failed and Most imprisoned, it has been identified as the catalyst for the swift spread of anarchist ideas in Britain, and the growth of organised anarchist groups."]}, {"page": "Hinduism and Theosophy", "response": ["According to John Driscoll, an author of The Catholic Encyclopedia, \"India is the home of all theosophic speculation\", because the main \"idea of Hindu civilization is theosophic.\" Its evolution, reflected in Indian religious literature, has shaped \"the basic principles of theosophy.\" Prof. Mark Bevir noted that Blavatsky identified India as the \"source of the ancient wisdom.\" She wrote about India the following:"]}]}}
