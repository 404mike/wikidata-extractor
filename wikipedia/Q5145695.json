He served in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Royal Ulster Rifles (into which he was commissioned in February 1944) throughout the Second World War, from 1939 to 1946, and then joined the Metropolitan Police as a Constable, rising through the ranks to Deputy Commander.\nIn 1966, he was promoted Commander (Traffic) and in 1968 Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Management Services). The following year he was appointed Commandant of Bramshill Police College, and in 1970 returned to the Met as Assistant Commissioner \"B\" (Traffic). On 31 March 1972 he was moved to be Assistant Commissioner \"C\" (Crime). This caused a certain amount of controversy, since he had never previously served in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which he was now taking over. Robert Mark, the new Commissioner, had already stated that he believed uniformed and CID officers should be interchangeable in senior posts, and Woods's appointment was the first example of this policy. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1973 Birthday Honours. In 1975, Mark appointed Woods Deputy Commissioner. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 1977 Birthday Honours.On 1 August 1977, Woods was appointed HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. He held this post for two years until he was asked to establish the new Australian Federal Police in 1979. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in the 1980 New Year Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Australian Federal Police", "response": ["| Commissioner || Sir Colin Woods ||  ||align=right|  ||align=right|  || "]}, {"page": "Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis", "response": ["*Colin Woods, 1970\u20131972", "*Colin Woods, 1972\u20131975"]}, {"page": "Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis", "response": ["*Sir Colin Woods, 1975\u20131977"]}, {"page": "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services", "response": ["* Sir Colin Woods, 19771979"]}, {"page": "Robert Mark", "response": ["Following Waldron's retirement, he was appointed Commissioner on 17 April 1972.

Mark continued to root out corruption, ably assisted by his Deputy Commissioner, Sir James Starritt. He also had to deal with the increase in IRA terrorism, including the Balcombe Street Siege, and also the Knightsbridge Spaghetti House Siege, taking personal command of both. Although popular with liberals for his stamping out of police corruption, Mark was himself far from a liberal, had no time for anti-establishment demonstrators and such groups as the National Council for Civil Liberties, and was responsible for the introduction of the Special Patrol Group, whose paramilitary methods provoked considerable criticism. Mark resigned in 1977 following a public disagreement with Jenkins, then Home Secretary, over the Police Act 1976 and the introduction of an independent police complaints body, which Mark considered would undermine police discipline and effective investigation.Obituary, The Telegraph, 1 October 2010"]}, {"page": "Colin Philip Joseph Woods", "response": ["#RedirectColin Woods"]}, {"page": "John Smith (police officer)", "response": ["He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in the 1986 New Year Honours and was knighted in the 1994 New Year Honours, unusually while his superior, Commissioner Paul Condon, was not a knight\"Yes, sir\", The Times, 31 December 1993 (Condon was knighted in the 1994 Birthday Honours).
