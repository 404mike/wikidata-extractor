William Morgan is often considered the father of modern actuarial science for his work in the field in the 1780s and 90s. Many other life insurance companies and pension funds were created over the following 200 years. Equitable Life was the first to use the word \"actuary\" for its chief executive officer in 1762. Previously, \"actuary\" meant an official who recorded the decisions, or \"acts\", of ecclesiastical courts. Other companies that did not use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable."]}, {"page": "Richard Price", "response": ["His extended family included William Morgan, the actuary, and his brother George Cadogan Morgan (1754\u20131798), dissenting minister and scientist, both sons of Richard Price's sister Sarah by William Morgan, a surgeon of Bridgend, Glamorganshire.", "In May 1770 Price presented to the Royal Society a paper on the proper method of calculating the values of contingent reversions.

The \"Northampton table\", a life table compiled by Price with data from Northampton, became standard for about a century in actuarial work. It, too, overestimated mortality. In consequence, it was good for the insurance business, and adverse for those purchasing annuities. Price's nephew William Morgan was an actuary, and became manager of the Equitable in 1775.
