He came off the bench in the game against Watford to score a \"stunning\" winner but found himself on the bench for the next game, a 2\u20130 defeat to Leeds, before starting five of the next six matches: a 3\u20130 win against Brighton and Hove Albion, a 2\u20130 defeat to Middlesbrough, the 3\u20131 defeat to Chelsea, a 2\u20132 draw against Norwich City on 20 December and a 2\u20130 win against Leeds on 30 December.
