He was assisted by College Prospects of America and attended Georgia State University and turned professional in 2007. Having failed to reach the final stage of the European Tour qualifying school, he gained his card on the Asian Tour. He had three top 10 finishes during his first season, but finished just outside the top 65 on the Order of Merit that was required to retain his playing status.\nTiley began the 2009 season on the Jamega Tour, a UK-based developmental tour. After a strong start, winning three tournaments, he started to play in some events on the second tier Challenge Tour. Later in the year he won the Egyptian Open, a Challenge Tour specially approved tournament prior to it becoming a full tour event in 2010.Since 2010 Tiley has played mainly on the Challenge Tour. He qualified for the European Tour in 2011 and 2017 but had little success and returned to the Challenge Tour. He did not win on the Challenge Tour until July 2019, when he won the Le Vaudreuil Golf Challenge, although he has been runner-up four times before that, in 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard McEvoy", "response": ["| Steven Tiley"]}, {"page": "Jarmo Sandelin", "response": ["| Paul Lawrie,  Steven Tiley"]}, {"page": "Scottish Challenge", "response": ["| 2013 ||  Brooks Koepka || align=center|266 || align=center|\u221218 || 3 strokes ||  An Byeong-hun Andrea Pavan Steven Tiley Sam Walker || Macdonald Spey Valley"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Steven Tiley||1982\u2013"]}, {"page": "2004 Open Championship", "response": [":Turnberry Kintyre \u2013 Lloyd Campbell (a), Steven Tiley (a), Paul Wesselingh, Sean Whiffin"]}, {"page": "2010 Open Championship", "response": [":Scotscraig: Gary Clark, Paul Streeter, Steven Tiley", "A big surprise of the first round was John Daly; the 1995 champion at St Andrews was at 66, in five-way tie for third with Bradley Dredge, Peter Hanson, Andrew Coltart, and Steven Tiley.
