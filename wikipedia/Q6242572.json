He first studied Politics, Government and History at the University of Adelaide, winning the Tinline Prize for a First Class Honours with Highest Distinction (1971). He won a Commonwealth Fellowship to study at the University of Toronto, where in the fields of philosophy and political economy he was awarded a doctorate and mentored and supervised by C.B. Macpherson. He later held a post-doctoral fellowship at King\u2019s College, at the University of Cambridge, where he worked closely with Anthony Giddens, Quentin Skinner and other leading scholars.\nJohn Keane is renowned globally for his creative thinking about democracy. Well before the European revolutions of 1989, John Keane first came to public prominence as a theorist and defender of \u2018civil society\u2019 and the democratic opposition in central-eastern Europe. Throughout the 1980s, he contributed extensively to the programme of \u2018flying university\u2019 apartment seminars in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. His political and scholarly writing during that period was published under the pen name Erica Blair. His Times Literary Supplement series of 18th-century-style dialogues with prominent underground human rights figures such as Adam Michnik and Gy\u00f6rgy Konr\u00e1d was read widely, and translated into many languages. He arranged and edited Vaclav Havel\u2019s first book in English, The Power of the Powerless (1985). In the spring of 1989, just before the revolutions that shook central-eastern Europe, he founded the world\u2019s first democracy research institute, the London-based Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD). During the past decade, he founded and directed the Sydney Democracy Network (SDN). He has contributed to The New York Times, Al Jazeera, the Times Literary Supplement, The Guardian, Harper's, the South China Morning Post and The Huffington Post.\nDuring his many years in Britain, the Times of London described him as 'one of the world's leading political thinkers and writers. El Pa\u00eds (Madrid) has ranked him as 'among the world's leading analysts of political systems' (2018). The Australian Broadcasting Commission called him 'one of the great intellectual exports from Australia.' His work has been translated into approximately 35 languages. During the period 2014-2019, his experimental online column \"Democracy Field Notes\" attracted nearly a million readers in the London, Cambridge- and Melbourne-based The Conversation. Among his best-known books are the prize-winning, best selling Tom Paine: A political life (1995), Violence and Democracy(2004), Democracy and Media Decadence (2013) and a full-scale history of democracy, The Life and Death of Democracy (2009). Forthcoming in Arabic, it has been published in Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian) and Korean; it was short-listed for the Prime Minister's Literary Award (2012) while the Japanese translation (2014) was ranked in the top three non-fiction books of that year published in Japan. His most recent books are When Trees Fall, Monkeys Scatter (2017); Power and Humility: the Future of Monitory Democracy (2018); and The New Despotism (2020). He was recently nominated for the 2021 Balzan Prize and the Holberg Prize for outstanding global contributions to the human sciences.\nIn 2021 Keane published the book To Kill a Democracy: India's Passage to Despotism  co-authored by Debasish Roy Chowdhury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n", "response": ["The convening of the Cortes de Le\u00f3n in the cloisters of the Basilica of San Isidoro would be one of the most important events of Alfonso's reign. The difficult economic situation at the beginning of his reign compelled Alfonso to raise taxes on the underprivileged classes, leading to protests and a few towns revolts. In response the king summoned the Cortes, an assembly of nobles, clergy and representatives of cities, and subsequently faced demands for compensatory spending and greater external control and oversight of royal expenditures. Alfonso's convening of the Cortes is considered by many historians, including Australia's John Keane, to be instrumental to the formation of democratic parliaments across Europe.  Note that Iceland had already held what may have been what is Europe's first parliament, the \u00deingvellir, in 930AD.
