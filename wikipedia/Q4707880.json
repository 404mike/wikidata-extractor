He played as a goalkeeper.\nTaylor began his professional career with Blackpool in 1963 after joining from local club Blackpool Rangers.\nDue to the form of Tony Waiters, Taylor didn't make his league debut for Blackpool until 29 January 1966, keeping a clean sheet in a goalless draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage. Another goalless draw followed, this time against Tottenham at Bloomfield Road, before Waiters returned to the fold for the remainder of the 1966\u201367 season.\nThe following season, 1967\u201368, Taylor made only two early- one late-season league appearances in Waiters' absence. When Waiters left to become a coach at Liverpool in April 1967, thus missing Blackpool's final six games of the season, manager Stan Mortensen favoured another goalkeeper \u2013 Kevin Thomas \u2013 for five of the games.\nThomas also started the first the games of the 1967\u201368 league season, before Taylor finally made the number-one jersey his own, appearing between the sticks for Blackpool's remaining 39 league games.\nIn 1968\u201369, Taylor made 38 league appearances. He missed four games in late March and early April, at which point Thomas deputised, but he regained his place for the run-in.\nUnder new manager Les Shannon, Taylor made only three league appearances during Blackpool's successful 1969\u201370 campaign, in which they gained promotion to Division One as runners-up behind Huddersfield Town. He was loaned out to Oldham Athletic during the season.\nIn his final season at Blackpool, 1970\u201371, Taylor's appearances were again limited: just nine in the league. His final appearance for Blackpool occurred on 17 April 1971, in a 3\u20132 home defeat to Nottingham Forest. He was loaned out to Stockport County during the season.\nTaylor signed for Southport in 1971, and he finished his career with the Sandgrounders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Taylor", "response": ["Alan Taylor may refer to:", "* Alan Taylor (Australian judge) (1901\u20131969), Australian High Court judge", "* Alan Taylor (television presenter) (1924\u20131997), Welsh television presenter", "* Alan Taylor (British judge) (born 1939), British judge", "* Alan Taylor (footballer, born 1943), English football goalkeeper for Blackpool", "* Alan Taylor (volleyball) (born 1950), Canadian volleyball player", "* Alan Taylor (footballer, born 1953), English football player for West Ham United", "* Alan Taylor (historian) (born 1955), United States historian", "* Alan Taylor (director) (born 1959), American film director"]}, {"page": "Alan Taylor (footballer born 1943)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Taylor (footballer, born 1943)"]}, {"page": "Cook Islands national under-20 football team", "response": ["*  Alan Taylor (2018-)"]}, {"page": "2000 OFC Nations Cup squads", "response": ["Coach:  Alan Taylor"]}]}}
