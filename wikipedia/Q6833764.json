He rejected advice to take an older mentor as his assistant and instead retained existing coaches Richard Cooper and Micky Moore, who he said were \"as hungry as I am for coaching\". Murray's first game as manager, a day later at Field Mill, was a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. After a successful month as caretaker-manager, Murray was given the job on a permanent basis on 5 December, becoming the youngest manager in the top four divisions of English football. He made four free transfer signings in the January transfer window: defenders Junior Brown, Michael Raynes and Matty Blair, and midfielder Ricky Ravenhill. He sold Rob Taylor to Tranmere Rovers after the versatile player sought a move closer to his home. He also made use of the loan market, bringing in Billy Kee, Callum Elder, Lenny Pidgeley, Jeffrey Monakana, Adam Smith and Terry Hawkridge. Murray signed a new two-year contract in May. Mansfield ended the 2014\u201315 season in 21st-place, seven points above relegated Cheltenham Town, and Murray released seven players in the summer, saying that \"I feel the whole club needs a fresh start\". Ollie Palmer was also sold to Leyton Orient."]}, {"page": "Johnny Mullins", "response": ["Mullins signed a two-year contract with League One club Stockport County on 16 June 2008, with Stockport paying Mansfield compensation. He made his debut for the club in a 1\u20131 draw away to Huddersfield Town on the opening day of 2008\u201309. Mullins scored his first goals for the club in a 4\u20132 win away to Yeovil Town on 13 December. He captained the team when club captain Michael Raynes was sidelined due to a hamstring injury. Mullins went on to make 39 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals. In 2009\u201310, Mullins took over as club captain, following the departure of Michael Raynes to Scunthorpe United. During the season, Mullins made 41 appearances in all competitions, scoring once."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["The Latics began the month of October in first place, where they had remained for most of the season. Oldham played a Friday night match versus local rival Stockport County, who sat in 7th place at the time. Oldham controlled the first half of the match, as an Andy Liddell goal in the 24th minute gave them a 1\u20130 halftime lead. However, Stockport dominated the second half, scoring three goals en route to giving Oldham their first defeat of the season. An 82nd-minute goal from Stockport defender Michael Raynes secured the victory, as the Hatters defeated Oldham 3\u20131. After dropping to third place, Oldham looked to regain the top spot in the league versus Hereford United. Lee Hughes got the action started quickly, scoring his fourth goal in the fifth minute of the game. Oldham continued their early pressure against the Hereford defence, which included Hughes earning Oldham a penalty kick after he was taken down in the area by Frenchman Bruno Ngotty\u2014with Andy Liddell converting on the penalty to give Oldham a 2\u20130 advantage. Wolves loaned defender Daniel Jones netted in the 36th minute for the Latics, giving the home side a 3\u20130 lead at the halftime break. Stephen O'Leary picked up a yellow card in the 81st minute for taking down Jones with a bad challenge, and was sent off only a minute later, forcing Hereford to play out the final minutes with only ten men. Danny Whitaker took advantage of the sending off, netting the final goal in the 90th. Oldham played their third game of the month on 18 October against Leicester. A lackluster first half of action led to scoreless action until the 54th minute, when a Steve Howard header gave the visitors a 1\u20130 lead. Danny Whitaker equalised a quarter-hour later, earning a 1\u20131 draw as Oldham maintained an unbeaten home record. Three days later, Oldham traveled to Memorial Stadium to face Bristol Rovers. A solid attack was stifled by Rovers goalkeeper Steve Phillips, who stopped all seven shots that were on target. Rickie Lambert netted his 11th goal of the season in the 16th minute, which led the way to a Chris Lines goal in the 35th minute. Phillips and Oldham's Mark Crossley both kept out the opposition for the remainder of the match, as Oldham dropped their second consecutive away match. For their second straight away match, Oldham faced Swindon Town who sat in 18th place in League One. Oldham looked to be in control in the first 20 minutes of the match, putting pressure on Swindon's net without any success. Shortly after their barrage on the goal, defender Sean Morrison scored for Swindon. A handball in the penalty area by Lee Hughes gave Swindon the opportunity to net another in the 34th minute, which was converted by Jack Smith to double Swindon's lead. The ball was bogged down in midfielder for second half, as neither side put pressure on goal\u2014letting Swindon wrap up their third home victory of the season. A Lewis Alessandra assured that Oldham would end October on a high note, as the striker scored his first hat trick in a 3\u20130 victory over Scunthorpe United. The 19-year-old led Oldham struck first in the 26th, before quickly earning his hat trick in the second half with goals in the 50th and 60th minutes. Oldham's 3\u20130 win over the Iron was Scunthorpe's first loss since 16 October, and helped the Latics move to 4th place in the league to end October."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Stockport County F.C. season", "response": ["|11||||FW||Michael Raynes||1||0||0||0|| 1", "|20||||DF||Michael Raynes||5||0", "| Michael Raynes || Scunthorpe United || 1 February 2010 || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["| Michael Raynes"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Michael Raynes"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|= ||DF || ||4 ||Michael Raynes || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 2", "|4 || ||DF ||Michael Raynes || 5 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 7 || 1", "| Michael Raynes"]}, {"page": "Raynes", "response": ["*Michael Raynes (born 1987), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|4 || ||DF ||Michael Raynes || 4 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 5 || 1"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|32||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Michael Raynes", "|9 January 2015||Michael Raynes||Oxford United||Free||"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|9 January 2015||DF|| Michael Raynes|| Mansfield Town||Free||"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["||DF || ||5 ||Michael Raynes || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3", "|6 || ||DF ||Michael Raynes|| 7 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 9 || 0", "| 20 May || CB ||  || Michael Raynes || Mansfield Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2015 || CB ||  || Michael Raynes || Carlisle United  || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["|rowspan=1| 7 ||DF || ||5 ||Michael Raynes || 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 3", "|5 || ||DF ||Michael Raynes || 6 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 7 || 1", "* The red card that Michael Raynes received in the Round 20 match against Luton Town was rescinded by the FA Appeal Board after the club appealed."]}]}}
