The reasons for doing so were rather complex.  In practice it was having difficulty operating as a coherent political organisation.  It had been badly divided internally in the context of a rather heated debate in the SSP around 50-50 representation for women in the run up to the 2003 Scottish election.  These divisions became exacerbated by the resignation of Tommy Sheridan as convenor and the election of the new convenor, which was a contest between two ISM members, Colin Fox and Alan McCombes.  Some leading members of the SSP, particularly women, had left the ISM or never joined, while others remained nominally members but were not taking part in meetings (e.g. only one member of the SSP executive, Joanna Harvie, attended the ISM meeting which decided to dissolve) and it had become an organisation of SSP middle cadre e.g. branch organisers.

According to the testimony of 11 SSP members who were at the meeting, including Colin Fox, Carolyn Leckie, Allan Green, Rosie Kane, Catriona Grant, Keith Baldassara, Jo Harvie and Barbara Scott, Sheridan admitted to a meeting of the SSP executive that he had visited Cupids in Manchester."]}, {"page": "History of the Scottish Socialist Party", "response": ["The 2003 elections to the Scottish Parliament took place shortly after the decision of the UK parliament to invade Iraq and the UK firefighter dispute 2002\u20132003.

It later emerged that he had been pressured into resignation by the party's National Executive because he intended to sue a national tabloid newspaper over stories he knew to be true. Colin Fox was elected to replace him at the party's 2005 leadership election.", "The SSP met immediately before the split at a national rally on 2 September 2006, at which Fox said \"the vast majority of SSP members\" had not been persuaded of the need for a new party.

In May 2012, a cross-party organisation called Yes Scotland was established to campaign for a Yes vote. The SSP's national co-spokesperson, Colin Fox, was invited to sit on its Advisory Board, reflecting the party's crucial support for independence over the past fifteen years. This was done at the insistence of Yes Scotland's non-partisan chief executive, Blair Jenkins, in the face of SNP opposition. During the referendum campaign, the party continued to campaign on other issues including the bedroom tax, fuel poverty, equal marriage, and the latest Israel-Gaza conflict.", "In an interview with the Sunday Herald in late August 2014, Colin Fox said: \"The SSP has brought a proletarian sense to Yes Scotland and reminded people the decisive issue is whether people think they're going to be better off. It's not the currency, it's not the EU, it's not those highfalutin' chattering class issues.\" He said that the party brought \"a sense of the schemes, the workplaces, the unions\" to the campaign.", "When the make-up of the Smith Commission was announced, Colin Fox protested the decision to \"uniquely exclude\" the SSP from proceedings. He wrote to the Smith Commission: \"The argument some use to justify our exclusion on the grounds that we currently have no 'parliamentary representation' fails to appreciate that the referendum was not a parliamentary process but an unprecedented public debate that resulted in an extraordinary level of engagement from all sections of society.
