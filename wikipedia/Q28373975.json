The Daily Telegraph called her \"the foremost historian of the medieval cathedral and diocese of Lincoln\".Major was born on 10 April 1906 in Holloway, London, where her father George Major was a potato merchant. The success of her father's business led the family to move to Holbeach in Lincolnshire before the end of the First World War. She went up to Oxford in 1925 to read history.Major received a bachelor's degree from St Hilda's College, Oxford, and after graduating she was the College Librarian until 1935. She was a fellow of the college from 1945. She began to assist F. M. Powicke in his work on Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, working in many cathedral and diocesan archives in England and Wales. The archival research on Langton also took her to Lincoln Cathedral, where she met Canon C. W. Foster, the principal founder of both the Lincoln Record Society and the Lincoln Diocesan Record Office. In 1935, with the help of a strong reference from Frank Stenton, she was appointed chief officer of the Lincoln Diocesan Record Office, and from 1935 to 1975 she served as general editor of the Lincoln Record Society, combining the post with the secretaryship from 1935 to 1956. From the 1960s onwards, she produced a number of pamphlets for the Friends of Lincoln Cathedral. She was also an active member of the British Records Association. She died on 19 December 2000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Hilda's College, Oxford", "response": ["|Kathleen Major ||10 April 1906||19 December 2000 ||1955\u20131965||"]}, {"page": "Mary Bennett (academic)", "response": ["Born Mary Letitia Somerville Fisher, she was the daughter of historian H.

Foster", "response": ["Foster's work involved editing documents about the church in 16th- and 17th-century Lincolnshire, and also the county and diocese's medieval records, the latter of which became his focus in the 1920s. He produced a calendar of 13th-century feet of fines from Lincolnshire in 1920, and then (with Canon Thomas Longley) an edition of the Lincolnshire sections of the Domesday survey, with an edition of the Lindsey Survey and a useful introduction on the county's lost settlements. Finally, he began a project to publish every document dating from before 1235 in the muniments of the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln. What followed was a careful and scholarly series of editions of these documents, three volumes of which were published before he died, and a further seven were continued thereafter by Kathleen Major, all under the title Registrum Antiquissimum, the name given to a 13th-century cartulary in the collection. This alerted many scholars to the range of this archive; as the medievalist Frank Stenton wrote, \"under his treatment, the archives of Lincoln Cathedral became national records\". Foster also published genealogical records; he continued to produce his calendar of Lincolnshire wills, and wrote a history of Aisthorpe and Thorpe-in-the-Fallows.Stenton (1937), pp. xiii\u2013xv.

His obituary in The Times noted Foster's \"profound and detailed knowledge of medieval Lincolnshire\".\"Obituary: Canon Foster\", The Times (London), 31 October 1935, p. 16. As Frank Stenton wrote, \"It is undoubtedly through the new materials which he made available to historians that Canon Foster contributed most to knowledge. But it should also be remembered that he saved innumerable documents from destruction or decay ... through him the records which illustrate [Lincolnshire's] past have become part of the fabric of English history\".Stenton (1937), pp. xi, xvi.
