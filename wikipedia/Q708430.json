Walls said Thatcher had not replied to his request.

With the recent experience of Chevaline in mind, the option of a purely British project was rejected. A study of the options was commissioned in February 1978 from a group chaired by the Deputy Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office, Sir Antony Duff, with the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, Sir Ronald Mason. The Duff-Mason Report was delivered to the Prime Minister, James Callaghan, in parts on 11 and 15 December.

On a personal note, I do favour grouping roles together rather than differentiating them unnecessarily. I note that you're approaching the issue from the perspective of NGA leaders. If this idea is taken forward there's huge amount of rework required across the other intelligence agencies, in the US alone. I've not got the time (or inclination) to hunt out people who have held intelligence roles as well as other senior governmental roles, but a quick scan of :Category:Directors-General of MI5,:Category:Chiefs of the Secret Intelligence Service, and :Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)#Directors of Military Intelligence throws up the following for consideration - Antony Duff, Dick White and Hugh Sinclair & John Alexander Sinclair who both held civilian and military intelligence roles."]}]}}
