One Nation Conservatives often invoke Edmund Burke and his emphasis on civil society (\"little platoons\") as the foundations of society, as well as his opposition to radical politics of all types. The Red Tory theory of Phillip Blond is a strand of the One Nation school of thought. Prominent Red Tories include former Cabinet Ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Eric Pickles and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Jesse Norman.Politics Review, April 2013 There is a difference of opinion among supporters regarding the European Union. Some support it perhaps stemming from an extension of the cohesion principle to the international level, though others are strongly against the EU (such as Peter Tapsell)."]}, {"page": "Hereford", "response": ["Hereford was the name of a parliamentary constituency centring on the city, from 1295 to 2010, when it was renamed as Hereford and South Herefordshire.

She was later indirectly identified as a suspected doper by MP Jesse Norman during a parliamentary inquiry into blood doping. In response, Radcliffe issued a statement in which she \"categorically denied\" cheating in any form and said she has \"nothing to hide\". Shortly afterwards, her three suspect test results were leaked, though Radcliffe still refused to release her complete blood-test history. In late November 2015, the IAAF declared that the accusations were \"based on the gross misinterpretation of incomplete data\". The UK Anti Doping Agency, having received Radcliffe's blood test history via the IAAF, stated that \"UKAD has come to the same conclusion as the IAAF review that there is no case to answer\". It is likely that the first suspicious off-score was caused by faulty equipment. The third suspicious off-score was the direct result of an altitude training trip in Kenya with Mo Farah and other British athletes."]}, {"page": "Paymaster General", "response": ["|Jesse Norman"]}, {"page": "Ross-on-Wye", "response": ["The town is part of the Hereford and South Herefordshire parliamentary constituency, currently represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative MP Jesse Norman."]}, {"page": "Herefordshire", "response": ["There are two parliamentary constituencies in Herefordshire. , Bill Wiggin represents North Herefordshire and Jesse Norman represents Hereford and South Herefordshire.
