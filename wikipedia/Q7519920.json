Santos committed a dangerous two-footed tackle on Johnson, and Suffo headbutted McInnes in the ensuing melee. Down to eight men, United conceded a third goal, with Dobie scoring his second of the afternoon. United midfielder Michael Brown and defender Robert Ullathorne suffered injuries that meant they could no longer take part in the match.

Sheffield United played West Bromwich Albion at their home ground, Bramall Lane, in the old Football League First Division on 16 March 2002. He dismissed three players during the course of the game, all from Sheffield United. First to go was the goalkeeper, Simon Tracey, after 9 minutes for a handball outside the penalty area (an incident totally unrelated to the chaos that would ensue in the second half). Then, after Georges Santos crashed into Albion's Andy Johnson on 65 minutes, he was also sent off. A minute later, Patrick Suffo was dismissed after a head-to-head confrontation with Derek McInnes. When two other players then had to be withdrawn injured after 77 minutes (coincidentally, immediately after West Brom scored their third goal), and with no replacements available, Wolstenholme had to abandon the game due to United having less than 7 players left on the field. Amongst other sanctions taken by the Football Association, Sheffield United were fined \u00a310,000 and their manager Neil Warnock \u00a3300.

Santos was in and out of the Blades team and notched up 68 appearances, with 6 goals scored during his time under Neil Warnock at Bramall Lane. Santos' 2001\u20132002 season with Sheffield turned out to be a career low point when he was one of three Sheffield United players to be sent off in the notorious Battle of Bramall Lane, a match against his former club West Brom that was abandoned when United's team was cut down to 6 players following three sending-offs and two injuries. With Goalkeeper Simon Tracey already off the field, the match had its climax in the 65th minute, when Santos, whom United had just brought on seconds earlier, was sent off for a high two-footed lunging tackle on Andy Johnson; Johnson had previously fractured Santos' cheekbone and seriously damaged his eye socket with a swinging elbow while playing for Nottingham Forest, and this was in fact their first encounter since the incident. The two teams then scuffled on the pitch; in the melee, another United substitute, Patrick Suffo, was sent off for head-butting Derek McInnes. Soon after, United captain Keith Curle was fortunate to avoid a sending off after appearing to throw punches at McInnes. Warnock never selected Santos again, and this was his final appearance as a Sheffield United player."]}, {"page": "Jason Brown (footballer)", "response": ["In his second year at the club he was more successful, as he became a regular in the club's academy teams and with the first team he trained one-on-one with new signing Dean Kiely. Charlton coach Gary Stevens later told Brown that \"a year ago you were a waste of space, but you've come on and proved a lot of people wrong\". At the end of his apprenticeship, Brown was offered a one-year professional contract with Addicks for the 2000\u201301 season. However, he struggled to make an impact on the squad with four other senior goalkeepers in the team. As so he entered into talks with club manager Alan Curbishley who believed that he wouldn't continually improve as a player and thus offered to help him find a new club. Concerned about his footballing future, Brown looked for jobs elsewhere. After being recommended by Dean Kiely to Sheffield United's assistant manager Kevin Blackwell, Brown earned a trial at Bramall Lane. With the club he then featured in a friendly game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, Brown eventually wasn't offered a contract as Warnock was looking for a more experienced alternative to first choice goalkeeper Simon Tracey."]}, {"page": "Graham Benstead", "response": ["Benstead was a regular for Sheffield United during the 1988\u201389 season, at the end of which the club celebrated promotion to the Second Division after a second-place finish.
