Then John Sinclair came in whom Box knew from the times he was a member of Heavy Metal Kids and who currently played with a Los Angeles band called Lion. The band's new vocalist became Peter Goalby of Trapeze fame.

LP that takes its strength from the tight vocal harmonies and solid original material\", suggesting that \"Several of the songs included here could become AOR staples\".
