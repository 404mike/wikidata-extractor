He made his professional debut for the club at the age of 20 in 2004 but only made one further senior appearance before being released following a brief loan spell with Forest Green Rovers. He joined Bristol Rovers, helping the club win promotion to League One after winning the 2007 Football League Two play-off Final. He remained in the first team for several years, making over 150 appearances in all competitions for the club before joining Hereford United in 2012 after an initial loan spell.\nHowever, he was released by Hereford after making just two league appearances following his permanent transfer. He instead joined his hometown club Newport County in November 2012 but suffered a serious double break in his ankle during a match in August 2013. Although he made a brief return to playing, the injury would eventually result in his retirement from playing after struggling to regain fitness. Following his retirement, he was appointed as a youth coach at Newport and was eventually promoted to academy manager after a spell as the interim academy manager.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol Rovers F.C.", "response": ["|Academy Head of Coaching||Byron Anthony"]}, {"page": "Newport County A.F.C.", "response": ["In May 2014 Glyn Jones was succeeded after 17 years as academy director by Michael Flynn.

Despite a spirited performance, the Gulls were unable to overcome a strong Saints side and had to accept a 4\u20131 defeat as well as the fact that Torquay had now gone ten years without reaching the Second Round of the League Cup.  However, the Gulls did not have to wait much longer for their first victory of the season and it was to be a particularly enjoyable one for the Torquay fans as it came at the home of Paul Buckle's new side Bristol Rovers.  Goals from Taiwo Atieno and Rene Howe in the first fifteen minutes was enough to secure all three points at the Memorial Stadium, despite Byron Anthony snatching one back for Rovers in the second half.  Back to back away victories were then achieved with a hard-fought 1\u20130 win at Aldershot, pushing the Gulls up to 4th in the League Two table.  However, Torquay were soon brought back down to earth when newly promoted Crawley Town came to Plainmoor and easily outplayed the home side in a 3\u20131 defeat of the Gulls.
