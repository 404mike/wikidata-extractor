This created outrage among his constituents, some of whom protested by bringing the fish to meetings. Lees reported that, even eight years after Bond's death, when he expressed regret at the loss of Bond to another man, the man replied \"Yes, but I do think that it was a pity he said that about a working man's dinner\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| George Bond"]}, {"page": "George Bond", "response": ["George Bond may refer to:", "*George Bond (pirate) (fl. 1683\u20131684), English pirate in the Caribbean", "*George Bond (footballer) (1910\u20131982), English professional footballer", "*George Bond (mayor) (died 1592), Lord Mayor of London"]}]}}
