This created outrage among his constituents, some of whom protested by bringing the fish to meetings. Lees reported that, even eight years after Bond's death, when he expressed regret at the loss of Bond to another man, the man replied \"Yes, but I do think that it was a pity he said that about a working man's dinner\".\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
