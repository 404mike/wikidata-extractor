This was due to Formula One's governing body discovering that one mandatory seal was missing. Further samples from the electronic box were taken after the race; this was software downloaded which did not discover any issues with the coding. A spokesman for the McLaren team said that: \"No one changed the software, so there's no reason for us to be worried.\" At the hearing on 25 July, the FIA ruled that McLaren did not gain an advantage from the missing seal and that H\u00e4kkinen's victory would stand. However, McLaren were deducted 10 points from the Constructors' Championship and fined $50,000 for contravening Article 7 of the 2000 Formula One Sporting Regulations, which stated that competitors had to maintain some conditions of safety and eligibility during the event. McLaren International managing director Martin Whitmarsh announced that the team would not appeal the penalty. The Vice-President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport Norbert Haug later criticised the decision and believed that the seal was never put on H\u00e4kkinen's car. Haug also said he would not take any further action regarding the matter."]}]}}
