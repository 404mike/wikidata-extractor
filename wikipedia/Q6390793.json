Like the related boron hydrides, these clusters are polyhedra or fragments of polyhedra, and are similarly classified as closo-, nido-, arachno-, hypho-, etc., based on whether they represent a complete (closo-) polyhedron or a polyhedron that is missing one (nido-), two (arachno-), three (hypho-), or more vertices. Carboranes are a notable example of heteroboranes.The Wade\u2013Mingos rules were first stated by Kenneth Wade in 1971 and expanded by Michael Mingos in 1972:"]}, {"page": "Polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory", "response": ["In chemistry the polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory (PSEPT) provides electron counting rules useful for predicting the structures of clusters  such as borane and carborane clusters. The electron counting rules were originally formulated by Kenneth Wade, and were further developed by others including Michael Mingos; they are sometimes known as Wade's rules or the Wade\u2013Mingos rules. The rules are based on a molecular orbital treatment of the bonding. These notes contained original material that served as the basis of the sections on the 4n, 5n, and 6n rules. These rules have been extended and unified in the form of the Jemmis mno rules."]}, {"page": "Carre's Grammar School", "response": ["Carre's has produced a number of notable alumni in a range of fields and professions. In politics, this includes Sir Robert Pattinson (1872\u20131954), member of parliament and chairman of Kesteven County Council, and his brother Samuel (1870\u20131942), also a member of parliament and businessman. The diplomat Peter Bateman (b. 1955), who served as the British ambassador to Bolivia, Luxembourg and Azerbaijan, was also a pupil at the school. Carrensians in the military include Air Marshal Barry North (b. 1959) and Captain George Baldwin, CBE, DSO (1921\u20132005), who served in World War II and as Director of Naval Air Warfare in the mid-1960s. The lawyer and controversialist John Austin (1613\u20131669) was educated at Carre's, along with the Royalist poet Thomas Shipman (1632\u20131680) and the non-conformist clergyman Andrew Kippis, FRS (1725\u20131795). Science is represented by the chemist Kenneth Wade, FRS (1932\u20132014), a professor at Durham University, and the forensic pathologist Iain West (1944\u20132001). In sports, the school has produced at least two professional footballers: Paul Holland (b. 1973), who played for Mansfield Town, Sheffield United, Chesterfield and Bristol City, and Mark Wallington (b. 1952), who played for England under 23s and Leicester City."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society W, X, Y, Z", "response": ["|Kenneth Wade||16/03/1989|| 13 October 1932 -  16 March 2014 Chemist"]}, {"page": "Norman Greenwood", "response": ["Greenwood was a senior research fellow at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment from 1951 until 1953 when he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Nottingham.
