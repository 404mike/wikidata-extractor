Around this time he learned that Helen Ryan, an actress who impressed him in a televised play about King Edward VII, was planning to run the Horseshoe Theatre in Basingstoke with her husband, Guy Slater. Cushing wrote to the couple and suggested they stage The Heiress, a play by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, with Cushing himself in the lead role. Ryan and Slater agreed, and Cushing later said performing the part was his most pleasant experience since his wife had died four years earlier. Cushing also starred in several horror films released in 1975. Among them were Land of the Minotaur, where he played Baron Corofax, the evil leader of a Satanic cult opposed by a priest played by Donald Pleasence.Monush, p. 599 Another was The Ghoul, where he played a former priest hiding his cannibalistic son in an attic. That film marked the first Cushing worked for producer Kevin Francis, who worked in minor jobs at Hammer and had long aspired to work with Cushing, whom he admired deeply. They went on to make two other films together, Legend of the Werewolf (1975) and The Masks of Death (1984) with the actor playing Sherlock Holmes once more.Cushing, p. 11 Cushing appeared in the television film The Great Houdini (1976) as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes.

The character was portrayed as a capable, if slightly vain, career policeman with a prickly but ultimately affectionate relationship with Holmes \u2013 as evidenced in the dramatisation of the aforementioned \"We're proud of you\" scene. So familiar did Jeavons become in the part that when he was unavailable for \"The Eligible Bachelor\", Lestrade was replaced by another of ACD's Yarders, Inspector Montgomery. Lestrade's absence was explained as having gone to the Leamington Baths on vacation, and Holmes fumes that he hopes his wife was with him. This is an embellishment on canon, as Lestrade was never shown to be married or attached. In other episodes, Jeavons was given parts originally belonging to other detectives, such as \"The Adventure of the Creeping Man\" and extra scenes in \"The Master Blackmailer\" (their version of \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\"). Lestrade was even mentioned off-screen in the scripts, emphasising his close relationship with 221B Baker Street. Jeavons' portrayal is considered the most faithful to the Canon. In Starring Sherlock Holmes David Stuart Davies wrote, \"Lestrade was played with great panache throughout the Granada series by Colin Jeavons, who humanised and enhanced Doyle's sketchy portrait of the Inspector.\"", "*\"Starring Sherlock Holmes\" David Stuart Davies; Titan Books, 2001"]}, {"page": "The Adventure of the Creeping Man", "response": ["David Stuart Davies, who has written an afterword for the Case-Book, comments that this story \"veers towards risible science fiction\".Conan Doyle, Sir Arthur, The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes - (Collector's Library).
