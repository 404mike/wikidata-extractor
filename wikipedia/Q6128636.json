He is credited with the discovery of Galanthus \u00d7allenii (1883).Allen spotted Galanthus \u00d7allenii amongst a batch of bulbs that had been imported from the Caucasus. Originally classed as a species, this strongly scented snowdrop is now thought to be a hybrid.

He claimed in 1891 that he grew every known species of Galanthus and had raised over 100 distinct seedlings, but much of his collection was lost to botrytis and narcissus fly soon afterward. At least two of his cultivars, G. 'Magnet' and G. 'Merlin', survive and are widely grown by collectors. He also raised hybrids which he called G. 'Galatea' and G. 'Robin Hood', but the plants now grown under those names may not be the same as those he selected. Galanthus x allenii is a hybrid of unknown origin that appeared in a batch of G. latifolius (now G. platyphyllus), which Allen received from an Austrian supplier in 1883. (According to Bishop et al., it is more likely that the bulbs were another broad-leaved species, G. woronowii, often confused with G. platyphyllus.) The bulbs were probably collected in the Caucasus, but G. \u00d7 allenii has never been found in the wild since, so that no one can do more than speculate on where the cross occurred and what other species may have been involved. It is a handsome plant with broad, greenish-grey foliage and fairly large flowers, which smell of bitter almonds."]}, {"page": "Galanthus nivalis", "response": ["* G. nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Doncaster's Double Scharlock' \u2013 a loose double, with three to six outers, strongly tipped with green, and a long, upright split spathe (the two parts of which sometimes cross over each other); named after plantswoman Amy Doncaster, who grew it as 'Scharlockii Flore Pleno', thinking that it must be the same as the double raised from seed of 'Scharlockii' by nurseryman James Allen early in the 20th century, but a contemporary drawing of the original plant shows it to have been less striking than this one"]}, {"page": "List of snowdrop gardens", "response": ["A galanthophile is a snowdrop enthusiast.
