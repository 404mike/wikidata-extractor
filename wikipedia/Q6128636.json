He is credited with the discovery of Galanthus \u00d7allenii (1883).Allen spotted Galanthus \u00d7allenii amongst a batch of bulbs that had been imported from the Caucasus. Originally classed as a species, this strongly scented snowdrop is now thought to be a hybrid. It is described as being \"intermediate in appearance between G. caucasicus [ now G. elwesii var. monostictus ] and G. ikariae\", and may be a natural hybrid between those species.", "link_mentions": {}}}
