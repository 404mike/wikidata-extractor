Three civilian security guards disarmed him as he entered the building, by trapping him within the revolving doors of the main lobby entrance. The security guards were injured during the struggle with Stone. Following the security breach, the building was evacuated and a British Army Bomb Disposal Unit was called to examine the suspect device.

This is more to do with halting the process of change which Sinn F\u00e9in has been driving forward than with anything that happened at the Northern Bank\".

A man from Kilcoo was charged with robbery, hostage-taking and possession of a firearm or imitation firearm. The individual arrested in Dungannon was named as Brian Arthurs, a member of Sinn F\u00e9in and brother of Declan Arthurs, an IRA volunteer killed in 1987. The man from Coalisland was charged with making false statements to police in relation to a white Ford Transit van allegedly used in the robbery.
