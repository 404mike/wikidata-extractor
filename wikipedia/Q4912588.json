He was also invited to play for the Barbarians on several occasions. Geen unsuccessfully trialled for England in 1910, but was selected and played for Wales on three occasions in the 1912\u20131913 season. Injury prevented him from playing more internationals, and his service in the First World War put an end to his career.\nGeen excelled athletically at Oxford, earning four Blues between 1910 and 1913. However, in three successive Varsity Matches, he failed to score after dropping the ball over the tryline. In the holidays, he played club rugby for Newport, and he was part of the team that defeated the touring South African side of 1912\u20131913. He was also a decent cricketer keeping wicket for Oxford University Authentics and Monmouthshire.\nGeen was commissioned second lieutenant into the 9th King's Royal Rifle Corps in August 1914, and sent to the Western Front in May 1915. He was killed in action in Hooge, Belgium. He is remembered on the Menin Gate memorial.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Wales rugby union footballers killed in the World Wars", "response": ["* Billy Geen (3 caps)"]}, {"page": "Oxford University RFC", "response": ["*  Billy Geen"]}, {"page": "1915 in Wales", "response": ["*31 July - Billy Geen, soldier and Wales international rugby union player, 24 (killed in action)"]}, {"page": "1891 in Wales", "response": ["*14 March \u2013 Billy Geen, Wales international rugby union player (killed in action 1915)"]}, {"page": "1912\u201313 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe", "response": [";Newport: H Wreford, Billy Geen, Walter Martin capt., J Wetter, Fred Birt, Reg Plummer, Tommy Vile, Jack Beames, J Williams, Harry Wetter, C Anderson, A Bell, R Dibble, Harry Uzzell, AR Williams", ";Wales: Bobbie Williams (Cardiff), Billy Geen (Newport), Fred Birt (Newport), Billy Spiller (Cardiff), Reg Plummer (Newport), Horace Thomas (Swansea), Tommy Vile (Newport) (capt.), F Andrews (Pontypool), Rees Thomas (Pontypool), F Perrett (Neath), Glyn Stephens (Neath), Percy Jones (Newport), Harry Wetter (Newport), Bert Hollingdale (Swansea), Johnnie Morgan (Llanelli)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Newport", "response": ["* Billy Geen"]}, {"page": "George Littlewood Hirst", "response": ["Hirst made his debut for Wales on 3 February 1912 against Scotland.
