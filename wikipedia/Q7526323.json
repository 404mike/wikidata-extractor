Basset was personally on bad terms with Hawkins, and they fought a notorious duel in 1810, although neither was injured.

The Mitchell constituency was a rotten borough and Hawkins was involved in this disreputable business of selling seats in parliament. Two years later Wilbraham was elected for the nearby constituency of Helston, representing his mother's family's interests. From 1790 to 1796 he succeeded his brother George Wilbraham as the Member of Parliament for Bodmin. He made eight speeches in parliament and helped to manage the mistaken impeachment of Warren Hastings following his recall from India.Roger Wilbraham, History of Parliament, retrieved 18 October 2014 Wilbraham also spoke in defence of Edmund Burke and he was also a strong supporter of Charles James Fox."]}, {"page": "Kit Hawkins (baronet)", "response": ["#redirect Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "All Saints' Church, Pentewan", "response": ["The church was built in 1821 by Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet as part of a scheme to improve Pentewan village."]}]}}
