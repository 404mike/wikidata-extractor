They were advised by Robert Young, the \"Actors' MP\". Like many other British trade unions, Equity operated a closed shop policy, so it was not possible for someone to join unless they had a record of sufficient paid work and most jobs were reserved for Equity card holders. To allow new members to join, there was a limited number of non-card holding jobs on regional productions. Whilst working on these productions, actors held a provisional membership card, and could apply for full membership on completing the requisite number of weeks, subsequently allowing them to work in the West End or on film and television."]}, {"page": "Robert Young", "response": ["* Robert Young (materials scientist) (born 1948), British materials scientist", "* Robert Young (actor) (1907\u20131998), American actor", "* Robert Young (director) (born 1933), British film and television director", "* Robert Young, pen name of British writer Robert Payne (1911\u20131984)", "* Robert Young (musician) (1964\u20132014), lead guitarist with Primal Scream", "* Robert Young (soldier) (1877\u20131953), New Zealand military officer", "* Robert Young (Canadian politician) (1834\u20131904), Canadian politician and businessman", "* Robert Young (Hawaii chief) (1796\u20131813), Hawaiian chief", "* Robert Young (Islington North MP) (1891\u20131985), British Member of Parliament for Islington North", "* Robert Young (trade unionist) (1872\u20131957), British Member of Parliament for Newton", "* Robert Young (biblical scholar) (1822\u20131888), Scottish publisher, author of Young's Literal Translation of the Bible", "* Robert Young (clergyman) (1796\u20131865), President of the Methodist Conference in 1856", "* Robert Young (priest) (died 1716), Canon of Windsor", "* Robert Young (American football) (born 1969), American football player", "* Robert Young (athlete) (1916\u20132011), American track athlete", "* Robert Young (runner) (born 1982), British endurance runner", "* Robert Young (architect) (1822\u20131917), Irish architect on List of Privy Counsellors of Ireland", "* Robert Young (forger) (1657\u20131700), forger and cheaty", "* Robert Young (sternwheeler), ship"]}, {"page": "Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Robert Young"]}, {"page": "Albert Goodman", "response": ["As Labour's vote collapsed at the 1931 general election, he won the Islington North from the constituency's Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Young, who had gained it from the Conservatives in 1929."]}, {"page": "Reginald Stanley Young", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Young (Islington North MP)"]}, {"page": "Reginald Young", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Young (Islington North MP)"]}, {"page": "Robert Stanley Young", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Young (Islington North MP)"]}, {"page": "Robert Young (London politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Young (Islington North MP)"]}]}}
