He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the Old Faithful bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. He also competed in the men's individual pursuit at the 1996 Summer Olympics.Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree has been very open about living with bipolar disorder and depression, and the fact that he has attempted suicide three times in his life, using his experiences as a means of encouraging other sportspeople to talk about their own mental health.His life and exploits have been dramatised in the 2006 film The Flying Scotsman and more recently in the documentary film Battle Mountain: Graeme Obree's Story, which follows his journey to Battle Mountain, Nevada to compete in the 2013 World Human Powered Speed Championships.\nIn March 2010 he was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Graeme Obree (born 1965), world record holding cyclist"]}, {"page": "Track cycling", "response": ["During the early 1990s in individual pursuit events, some riders, most notably Graeme Obree, adopted a straight-armed Superman-like position with their arms fully extended horizontally, but this position was subsequently outlawed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport's ruling body.", "Attempts are generally made at velodromes with a reputation for being fast. Recently, these have mostly been at high-altitude locations, such as Mexico City, Mexico or Aguascalientes, Mexico, where the thinner air results in lower aerodynamic drag, offsetting the added difficulty of breathing.

Then in the late 1980s triathletes developed so-called tri-bars that allowed for a much better aerodynamic position.  They were first brought into the time trialling public eye in the 1989 Tour de France when Greg LeMond overcame a 50-second deficit in the final day's time trial to win the Tour by 8 seconds from Frenchman Laurent Fignon.  Fignon was using conventional handlebars, Lemond the new triathlon style.  The concept has changed little since then, with only Scotsman Graeme Obree attempting to improve the idea.  His arms-under-the-torso tuck was revolutionary, helping him and others to break world records and win World Championships.  The UCI banned it in 1994, but he came back with the 'Superman' position, an evolution of the traditional tri position, but with the arms fully stretched out in front.  This was also banned, and there are now strict rules governing the dimensions of handlebars, which can make life difficult for taller riders who fall outside the defined parameters and must adapt their positions to fit the rules."]}, {"page": "Irvine, North Ayrshire", "response": ["* Graeme Obree, racing cyclist and former world hour record-holder, lives near Irvine."]}, {"page": "Union Cycliste Internationale", "response": ["The original records were on the track: unpaced, human-paced and mechanically paced.
