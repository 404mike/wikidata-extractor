Although his total number of votes fell from 14,354 to 12,227 he was able to increase his majority over Stevens from 1,803 to 1,863 with the anti-Labour vote split by the presence of a Liberal Party candidate. A minority Labour government that was formed following the election collapsed in October 1924, necessitating a further general election. Although he managed to increase his vote, Buckle was defeated in a straight fight by the Conservative candidate Albert Bethel by over 2,000 votes. He died in the following year."]}]}}
