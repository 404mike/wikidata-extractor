Another work familiar to many people is Off Portland (1871) based on a painting by John Wilson Carmichael.\nMottram died on 30 August 1876 in Camden Town, London.\nHe was the grandfather of a prominent New Zealand artist, Charles Howorth (1856\u20131945).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jacob Thompson (painter)", "response": ["Thompson began to exhibit in 1824, when he had in the first exhibition of the Society of British Artists a \"View in Cumberland,\" but he did not send a picture to the Royal Academy until 1832, in which year appeared \"The Druids Cutting Down the Mistletoe\". This was followed in 1833 by a picture containing full-length portraits of the daughters of the Hon. Colonel Lowther. His next exhibit was \"Harvest Home in the Fourteenth Century,\" which appeared at the British Institution in 1837, and was presented by the artist to his patron, the Earl of Lonsdale. After this date he painted portraits, views of mansions, etc., but he did not exhibit again until 1847, when he sent to Westminster Hall \"The Highland Ferry-Boat,\" which was engraved in line by James Tibbits Willmore. \"The Proposal\" appeared at the Royal Academy in 1848; \"The Highland Bride,\" likewise engraved by Willmore, in 1851; \"Going to Church: Scene in the Highlands,\" in 1852; \"The Hope Beyond,\" in 1853; \"The Course of true Love never did run smooth,\" in 1854; \"The Mountain Ramblers,\" in 1855; \"Sunny Hours of Childhood\" and \"Looking out for the Homeward Bound,\" in 1856; and \"The Pet Lamb,\" in 1857. He painted in 1858 \"Crossing a Highland Loch,\" which was engraved by Charles Mottram; but he did not again exhibit until 1860, when he sent to the Royal Academy \"The Signal,\" which was engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal of 1862. In 1864, he had at the academy \"The Height of Ambition,\" engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal, as was likewise by J. C. Armytage \"Drawing the Net at Hawes Water,\" painted in 1867 for Lord Esher, but never exhibited. \"Rush Bearing\" and a view of Rydal Mount are among his best works."]}, {"page": "The Last Judgement (Martin paintings)", "response": ["Martin signed an agreement with the publisher and printseller Thomas Maclean in June 1851, under which Martin's painting The Great Day of His Wrath would be engraved and the painting would be exhibited to publicise subscriptions for the print. Maclean was to retain two thirds of the net profits from the print, with Martin receiving one third.  The painting was sent to the engraver, Charles Mottram, by the end of 1851.  Martin probably started work on the second and third paintings before the end of 1851, and a second agreement for their engraving was signed on 23 June 1852."]}, {"page": "Charles Howorth", "response": ["Members of Howorth's extended family included the British engraver Charles Mottram (his grandfather) and  New Zealand politician Henry Howorth (his uncle)."]}, {"page": "Penguin Popular Classics", "response": ["| Journey to the Centre of the Earth || Jules Verne ||  || Charles Mottram"]}]}}
