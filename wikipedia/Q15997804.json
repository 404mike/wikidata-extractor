He was re-elected in 1923, and served as Under-Secretary of State for Air in the First Labour Government.\nLeach lost the seat at the 1924 general election to his Conservative party opponent. His share of the vote had increased, but the absence for the first time of a Liberal Party candidate proved more beneficial to the Conservatives. He was re-elected to the House of Commons at the 1929 general election, but was defeated again when the Labour Party split at the 1931 general election.  He regained the seat at the 1935 general election, and represented Bradford Central for a decade until retiring from politics at the 1945 general election.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
