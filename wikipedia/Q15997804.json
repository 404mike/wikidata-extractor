He was re-elected in 1923, and served as Under-Secretary of State for Air in the First Labour Government.\nLeach lost the seat at the 1924 general election to his Conservative party opponent. His share of the vote had increased, but the absence for the first time of a Liberal Party candidate proved more beneficial to the Conservatives. He was re-elected to the House of Commons at the 1929 general election, but was defeated again when the Labour Party split at the 1931 general election.  He regained the seat at the 1935 general election, and represented Bradford Central for a decade until retiring from politics at the 1945 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bradford Pioneer", "response": [":1915: William Leach", ":1920s: William Leach", ":1929: William Leach"]}, {"page": "William Leach", "response": ["William Leach may refer to:", "* William Leach (politician) (1870\u20131949), British Labour Party politician, minister in the first Labour government", "* William Leach (canoeist) (born 1946), American sprint canoer", "* William Leach (cricketer, born 1851) (1851\u20131932), English cricketer", "* William Leach (cricketer, born 1883) (1883\u20131969), English cricketer", "* William Leach (Canadian Army officer) (1942\u20132015)"]}, {"page": "Muriel Paget", "response": ["Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that Lady Muriel had \"no experience in the British Intelligence Service\" and stressed that her work was \"thoroughly unselfish and humanitarian\".

William Leach, MP for Central Bradford (Labour), became the campaign's chief Parliamentary spokesperson. Four months later 8,000 had joined, with sixteen branches across the north of England by December the same year.  Membership grew very rapidly, reflecting the large number of women who had lost fiances in the first world war.  By December 1938 membership was 140,000 across 104 branches.  Scotland had its own Scottish Women's Pension League.", "Increasing support from MPs led to a deputation from the House of Commons to Kingsley Wood, asking for an enquiry.  It was refused on grounds of expense and the likelihood of encouraging claims from other groups.  William Leach MP put forward a Private Member's Bill in early 1938, again proposing an enquiry.  By now the campaign had the support of nearly 300 MPs and had achieved widespread press coverage."]}, {"page": "Kathleen Chambers", "response": ["In June 1945 Chambers was the Labour nominee to be the Lord Mayor for 1945\u20131946 and the nomination was agreed by the other parties.  Re-elected in Manningham in November 1945, Chambers was elected Lord Mayor on 10 November and also re-elected as an alderman. As her Lady Mayoress, Chamber chose her friend and fellow magistrate Martha Leach - who also happened to be the wife of Manningham's other councillor William Leach.  As well as being the first woman Lord Mayor of Bradford Chambers was also the first Catholic woman to be a Lord Mayor in the United Kingdom.  Her Catholicism did draw criticism when she expressed a desire for Catholics to receive the religious education they desired, with a Protestant Electors' Association being formed to counter what its members considered was a breach of the traditional neutrality of the Lord Mayor by Chambers. Chamber's term of office as Lord Mayor was unfortunately marred by the theft of the mayoral car and the mayoral chains while Chambers was on official business in Leeds. The car was recovered but the chains weren't and an appeal had to be launched to raise funds for replacements."]}]}}
