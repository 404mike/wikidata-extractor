The friction between Arnold and General Horatio Gates, portrayed near the beginning of the film (for example, in one scene when Arnold derisively refers to him as \"Granny Gates\"), was historically accurate. The movie points out that, before his treason, Arnold was considered a patriot and a hero. A letter from General Washington is read at the beginning where he enthusiastically recommends Arnold for promotion saying that there is no general in the army more deserving and even comparing him to Hannibal.

It is here that real motives are revealed. Belial, who was loyal to Satan, now wants to get some advantage from the war of angels. He is frustrated by the inertness of Satan and now wants an aggressive Hell. Satan, who had initially opposed God for his love for humans, helps humans to fight Belial.
