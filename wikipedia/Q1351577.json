Thomson's gazelle and Thomson's Falls, Nyahururu are named after him.  Excelling as an explorer rather than an exact scientist, he avoided confrontations among his porters or with indigenous peoples, neither killing any native nor losing any of his men to violence. His motto is often quoted to be \"He who goes gently, goes safely; he who goes safely, goes far.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
