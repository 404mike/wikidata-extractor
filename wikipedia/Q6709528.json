After some early changes, the first stable lineup of the group consisted of Terry Hall and Neville Staple on vocals, Lynval Golding and Roddy Radiation on guitars, Horace Panter on bass, Jerry Dammers on keyboards, John Bradbury on drums, and Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez on horn.  Their music combines a \"danceable ska and rocksteady beat with punk's energy and attitude\". Lyrically, they present a \"more focused and informed political and social stance\".", "The group was formed in 1977 by songwriter/keyboardist Dammers, vocalist Tim Strickland, guitarist/vocalist Lynval Golding, drummer Silverton Hutchinson and bassist Horace Panter (a.k.a. Sir Horace Gentleman). Strickland was replaced by Terry Hall shortly after the band's formation. The band was first called the Automatics, then the Coventry Automatics. Vocalist Neville Staple and guitarist Roddy Byers (usually known as Roddy Radiation) joined the band the following year; the new line-up changed their name to the Special AKA. Joe Strummer of the Clash had attended one of their concerts, and invited the Special AKA to open for his band in their \"On Parole\" UK tour. This performance gave the Special AKA a new level of national exposure, and they briefly shared the Clash's management.", "The first reunion under the Specials name occurred in 1993. Producer Roger Lomas was asked by Trojan Records to get some musicians together to back ska legend Desmond Dekker on a new album. He approached all members of The Specials and the four that were willing to participate were Roddy Radiation, Neville Staple, Lynval Golding and Horace Panter, they were also joined by Aitch Bembridge, who had been the drummer in The Selecter.

Pepper's without doing Rubber Soul,\" a comment Panter found to be \"very pertinent,\" who noted that: \"[Dammers would] often say we've done that, now let's do something else. And other people would say, hey we've got this great thing going on here, why are we doing something different? That was probably the beginning of the fracturing of the band.\" During recording, Dammers had a heated row with Bradbury, who wanted to do a \"2 Tone review, mixing ska, soul and reggae,\" which seemed like a good idea to him and Panter. Recording was also hindered by outside interference, most notably when a journalist entered the studio to interview the band, who were recording one of the songs who then felt the interruption had sabotaged the \"vibe\" of the song. Another contributing factor to the dark tone of More Specials was the drink and drug-related issues within the band, racial squabbles in the audience of the band's live shows and guitarist Lynval Golding being victim to a violent racist attack.", "#\"Do Nothing\" (Lynval Golding) \u2013 3:43", "*Lynval Golding \u2013 vocals, guitar"]}, {"page": "Terry Hall (singer)", "response": ["After The Specials' single \"Ghost Town,\" was released, Hall left the band to start a new group called Fun Boy Three with two of his Specials bandmates, Lynval Golding and Neville Staple.
