Adcock is one of only two New Zealanders to have received the prestigious Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry (2006), with the other being Allen Curnow (who received the award in 1989). The 1970s and 1980s saw a shift away from New Zealand nationalism and the rise of confident young poets, often influenced by American writing and counterculture and writing about personal relationships; poets included Ian Wedde, Bill Manhire, Cilla McQueen, Elizabeth Smither, Sam Hunt and Murray Edmond. Cilla McQueen and Hunt are both well-known for their performance poetry. In 1985, Ian Wedde and Harvey McQueen edited and published a new edition of The Penguin Book of New Zealand Verse, which included poetry in M\u0101ori, a first for a New Zealand poetry anthology. Since then, New Zealand poetry has become more diverse and more difficult to characterise by theme."]}, {"page": "Robert Burns Fellowship", "response": ["* 1985\u201386 Cilla McQueen "]}, {"page": "Ralph Hotere", "response": ["Hotere was married three times, with two of his wives also being artists.
