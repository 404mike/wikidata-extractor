Genesis 2): The Book of Moses explains the meaning of verse 5 in terms of the LDS idea of a spiritual creation. God explains that He: \"created all things \u2026 spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air (additions italicized). Consistent with this concept, some ancient sources assert that the heavenly hosts\u2014variously described as including the angels, the sons of God, and/or the souls of humanity\u2014were part of the light that appeared on day one of creation.See, e.g., Margaret Barker.  \"Beyond the veil of the temple: The High Priestly origins of the apocalypses\" Scottish Journal of Theology 51(1) (1998): 1\u201321. Verse 17 is expanded in a way that reinforces the LDS teaching that Adam and Eve were placed in a situation where they were required to exercise freedom of choice in order to continue their progression through the experience of earth life As in the Quran, the transgression of Adam and Eve that led to their coming to earth is seen as a positive and necessary step that would provide the preparatory schooling they needed for an eventual glorious return to heaven.at-Tabataba'i, Allamah as-Sayyid Muhammad Husayn. 1973.

Most scholars today claim the Hebrew word 'almah, used in Isaiah, would more accurately be translated as young woman rather than virgin. However, the Septuagint version of Isaiah, which was translated by seventy Jewish scholars in the 2nd century BCE, and the Gospel of Matthew both use the Greek word parthenos, which unambiguously translates as virgin. Biblical scholar Margaret Barker points out that the text uses the definite article, reading ha-'almah and therefore The Virgin, an ancient title for the Holy Spirit. This view is supported by the apocryphal Gospel of the Hebrews in which Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit as his mother. For a full discussion of this debate see Virgin Birth."]}, {"page": "Barker (surname)", "response": ["* Margaret Barker (born 1944), Biblical scholar", "* Margaret Barker (artist) (1907\u20132003), British artist"]}, {"page": "Gilyonim", "response": ["Margaret Barkerin The Revelation of Jesus Christ Which God Gave to Him to Show to His Servants What Must Soon Take Place (Edinburgh: T. & T.
