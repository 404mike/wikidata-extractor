On 17 November 1834, the British amateur astronomer the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus."]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| Thomas John Hussey || England || 1792 || 1854", "*Thomas John Hussey (England, 1792\u20131854)"]}, {"page": "Hayes, Bromley", "response": ["* Thomas John Hussey (1792-1866) - local clergyman and astronomer, thought to be first person to suggest the existence of Neptune."]}, {"page": "Hussey", "response": [":* Thomas John Hussey (1792\u2013c. 1854), English clergyman and astronomer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Hussey", "response": ["* Thomas John Hussey (1792\u2013c. 1854), English clergyman and astronomer"]}, {"page": "Anna Maria Hussey", "response": ["In 1831, at 26, she married Rev.
