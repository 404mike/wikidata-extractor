Forman played youth football for the local village side before moving up to Beeston Town, where he was spotted by Derby County. County signed him in March 1894 but, after only making only eight appearances, he was transferred to East Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest in December 1894.", "Forman was selected to play for England in all three matches in the 1899 British Home Championship. For the match against Ireland, played at Roker Park on 2 March 1899, Forman's brother Fred made his international debut. They thus became the first brothers from the same professional club to represent England at the same time, a record that stood until Manchester United's Neville brothers repeated the feat in 1996, nearly a century later. England totally dominated the Irish team and the England forwards \"scored at will\" with four from Gilbert Smith, three from Jimmy Settle and two each from Fred Forman and Steve Bloomer. Frank Forman also got on the score-sheet with the opening goal as England ran out victors by a 13\u20132 margin. This is still the record number of goals scored by England in a single match and the highest aggregate goals (15) in a game involving England. England 13 \u2013 Ireland 2; 18 February 1899 (Match summary) Forman retained his place for the next two matches which resulted in victories over Wales (4\u20130) and Scotland (2\u20131), and thus England retained the Championship."]}, {"page": "Harry Linacre", "response": ["Linacre was born to farmer James Anthony and his wife Annie Linacre.
