His career started with a cover drive for four runs off his very first ball against a Sri Lanka A touring team in a List A game, where he went onto score 44 off 41 balls. After scoring heavily in Derbyshire's second XI, Wood went onto make his first-class debut for Derbyshire at the end of 2016 where he played the last two games of the season against Leicestershire and Worcestershire. Primarily an aggressive right-handed batsman, he also bowls right-arm off spin. He made his Twenty20 debut for Derbyshire in the 2017 NatWest t20 Blast on 3 August 2017. Wood was released by Derbyshire after the 2017 season but continued to make appearances for the second XI and in local cricket. After a number of impressive appearances in 2019 he rejoined the county on a short-term contract intended to cover the 2020 Royal London One-Day Cup, which was ultimately cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wood's contract would instead cover all formats for the truncated 2020 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|24|| Tom Wood ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium || "]}, {"page": "Thomas Wood", "response": ["*  Tom Wood (Pope)(2003-2021), Roman Catholic Church", "* Tom Wood (Derbyshire cricketer) (born 1994), English cricketer", "* Thomas Mills Wood (born 1963), American film and television character actor, aka Tom Wood", "* Tom Wood (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Tom Wood", "response": ["Tom Wood may refer to:", "* Tom Wood (actor) (born 1963), American film and television actor, birth name: Thomas Mills Wood", "* Tom Wood (photographer) (born 1951), Irish photographer", "* Tom Wood (rugby union) (born 1986), English rugby union player", "* Tom Wood (racing driver) (born 1956) Canadian race car driver", "* Tom Wood (horticulturalist), Hedychium coccineum breeder", "* Tom Wood (visual effects), visual effects supervisor", "* Tom Wood (author), British author of thriller novels", "* Tom Wood (ice hockey) (1927\u20132015), Canadian ice hockey player", "* Tom Wood (Derbyshire cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Wood (cricketer, born 1994)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Wood (Derbyshire cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Wood (Derbyshire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Wood (Derbyshire cricketer)"]}]}}
