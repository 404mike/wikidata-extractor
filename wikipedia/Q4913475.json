On 23 September 2012, Magennis scored his first goal of the season, in injury time in a 3\u20133 draw against Motherwell. His impressive performance caught the attention of the club's legend Billy Williamson who said he believed Magennis can achieve same the level of success at the club that he did. Soon after scoring his first goal of the season, Manager Craig Brown began negotiating with Magennis to sign a new contract. Due to the club's injury crisis, Magennis said he was willing to play in any position if any players suffered an injury. On 27 November 2012, Magennis scored a brace in a 3\u20132 loss against Inverness Caledonian Thistle and on 16 March 2013, scored a brace in a 4\u20133 loss against Celtic. After the match, Craig Brown was confident that Magennis would sign a new contract at the club. Magennis, himself, said he was aiming to sign a new contract. Eventually, at the end of the season, Magennis was the only out of contract player to be offered a new deal as thirteen players were released and he signed one-year deal to stay with the club."]}, {"page": "Dundee derby", "response": ["|   1977 ||  Billy Williamson ||Unknown", "* Billy Williamson"]}, {"page": "1980 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["The 1980 Scottish League Cup Final was played on 6 December 1980, at Dens Park in Dundee and was the final of the 35th Scottish League Cup competition.
