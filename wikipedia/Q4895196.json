He died in office in 1933, having served at the club for a total of 36 years.

It is unclear what exactly happened but, according to Collett, the most likely scenario is that Tottenham's goalkeeper George Clawley tried to catch a shot by Bert Lipsham and fumbled it. The ball dropped behind Clawley and he spun round to try and kick it away under pressure from Walter Bennett. The ball went out of play over the dead ball line and the linesman signalled a corner, as he thought Clawley had been the last player to make contact with the ball. The referee, however, overruled him and signalled a goal kick, as he thought Bennett had the last contact. Before Clawley could take the goal kick, the referee changed his mind and awarded a goal to Sheffield with Bennett named as the scorer.
