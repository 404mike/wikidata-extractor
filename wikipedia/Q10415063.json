The 1988\u201389 season again saw Stoke finish in mid-table which prompted speculation that Mills would not be offered a new contract. In the end he was given a 'final chance' to get Stoke promoted and he was given a \u00a31 million transfer budget by Coates for the 1989\u201390 season. He spent it all breaking the club's record transfer of \u00a3480,000 for Sheffield Wednesday defender Ian Cranson, \u00a375,000 on Derek Statham from West Bromwich Albion, \u00a3175,000 for Ian Scott and \u00a3250,000 for Wayne Biggins both from Manchester City.

The club had been through a tough period with poor finances and a humiliating relegation in 1984\u201385. Coates backed Mick Mills in 1986\u201387 for a promotion push but they fell short and Mills had to sell players before making additions. In preparation for the 1989\u201390 season Stoke spent a combined \u00a31million on new players with a then club record of \u00a3480,000 for Ian Cranson. However results were appalling and the team finished bottom of the table and fell into the third tier. In 1990 the Stoke City board consisted of six directors and it was agreed that a new share issue was needed, with the majority wanting the supporters to be free to purchase. Following disagreements regarding this share issue, several board members left and the board then consisted of Peter Coates, Keith Humphreys and David Edwards.

After making 213 appearances for Birmingham in five seasons he followed manager Lou Macari to Stoke City with a fee of \u00a355,000 being decided at a tribunal. He fitted in well with fellow defenders John Butler, Ian Cranson and Lee Sandford and in 1991\u201392 Stoke reached the play-offs where they lost to Stockport County although they did beat County in the 1992 Football League Trophy Final. Stoke won the Second Division title in 1992\u201393 after going on a club record unbeaten run of 25 games. Overson played in 52 matches in 1993\u201394 and 43 in 1994\u201395. After playing in the first 22 matches in 1995\u201396 he sustained a calf injury against Sunderland and was released by the club at the end of the season after making 215 appearances."]}]}}
