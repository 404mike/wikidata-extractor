He returned to rugby the following season and then went on to make the Stade side for the 2016\u201317 European Rugby Challenge Cup pool stage as Stade were demoted after failing to make the cut for the 2016\u201317 European Rugby Champions Cup after being unable to finish in the Top 8 in the 2015\u201316 Top 14 season. He helped Stade make the Cup Quarter final but in their Quarter final match against Ospreys, he received a yellow carded for foul play which was followed by another yellow card (and a red) after entering a ruck from the side but videos for the game showed he stamped on Osprey winger, Keelan Giles for which he was cited and later given a 10-week suspension."]}]}}
