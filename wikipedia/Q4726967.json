The Mushroom label is not to be confused with the Australian label of the same name, and was led by Vic Keary from the late 1960s from Chalk Farm Studios in Belmont Street, London.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Magic Carpet (band)", "response": ["The band members were Clem Alford, sitar; Alisha Sufit, voice and guitar; Jim Moyes, guitar; and Keshav Sathe, Indian tabla percussion. In 1972 the band released an eponymous album, Magic Carpet, on the Mushroom (UK) label that has since become a sought-after item in the international collectors' vinyl market.", "In the 1960s and 1970s, both in the UK and in America, there was a burgeoning interest in Indian culture and music, most famously spearheaded by virtuoso sitar player Ravi Shankar and sarod player Ali Akbar Khan, amongst others. Numerous UK bands of the era began to use sitar and Indian musical sounds generally to add a flavor of the east to their recordings. By contrast, Magic Carpet was a more cohesive Anglo-Indian fusion, the Indian instrumentation generating and being integral to the music, not simply an addition. Based around the classically trained sitar virtuoso, Alford, and the ethereal voice of Alisha Sufit, Magic Carpet created a distinctive sound described (perhaps misleadingly) as \"psychedelic progressive folk\" music - psych prog folk."]}, {"page": "Keshav Sathe", "response": ["In the 1980s, Sathe formed a group with Tony Roberts which included the dancer Shobhana Jeyasingh, and toured UK and Northern Ireland.  With the singer Alisha Sufit and group, he made the record \"Magic Carpet\". From 1965 to 1993 he regularly accompanied the late singer/dancer Surya Kumari in recitals and teaching workshops. He appears on Suns of Arqa's live album Musical Revue which was recorded in Manchester in 1982."]}, {"page": "St Mary's Town and Country School", "response": ["* Alisha Sufit - singer, songwriter, visual artist and poetAlisha's Secret Gallery"]}, {"page": "Not in Our Name CD", "response": ["*Alisha Sufit \u2013 singer, songwriter, poet", "# \"BLIAR\" \u2013 David Erdos (Alisha Sufit)", "# \"Mr Blair\" \u2013 Alisha Sufit (Alisha Sufit)"]}, {"page": "Alisha Through the Looking Glass", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alisha Sufit"]}, {"page": "Sufit", "response": ["*Alisha Sufit (born 1946), English singer-songwriter"]}]}}
