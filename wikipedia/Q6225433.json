It was a popular strip upon its release with Wee Peem and Little Dead-Eye Dick, possibly because the working-class children would relate to Snooty venturing with children from their family background. The media wrote of its shock when the series was cancelled in 1991: Mr Pepys called it \"[an] occasion for nationwide mourning\"; The Guardian implied its inference of paranoia and cowardice in Dr John Casey's article about the event in The Daily Mail because of Casey comparing it to \"John Major's drive for a classless society, a concept which does not go down very well in the sort of Scrutonian circles to which John Casey belongs.\" The new editor, Euan Kerr, admitted being apathetic towards the series, mostly because 1990s' children were far removed from a story about characters from the early 20th century. \"The sad truth is that he regularly came at the bottom of readers' popularity polls,\" he explained. \"His top hat and Eton collar must baffle today's kids.

His biographer Peter Lamont opines that he was one of the most famous men of his era. Harry Houdini described him as \"one of the most conspicuous and lauded of his type and generation\" and \"the forerunner of the mediums whose forte is fleecing by presuming on the credulity of the public.\" Home conducted hundreds of s\u00e9ances, which were attended by many eminent Victorians. There have been eyewitness accounts by s\u00e9ance sitters describing conjuring methods and fraud that Home may have employed.Frederick Merrifield. (1903). A Sitting With D. D. Home. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 11: 76\u201380. Quoted in Joseph McCabe. (1920). Spiritualism: A Popular History from 1847. Dodd, Mead and Company. pp. 110-112. A Mr. Merrifield was present at one of the sittings. Home's usual phenomena were messages, the moving of objects (presumably at a distance), and the playing of an accordion which he held with one hand under the shadow of the table. But from an early date in America he had been accustomed occasionally to \"materialise\" hands (as it was afterwards called). The sitters would, in the darkness, faintly see a ghostly hand and arm, or they might feel the touch of an icy limb. Mr. Merrifield and the other sitters saw a \"spirit-hand\" stretch across the faintly lit space of the window. But Mr. Merrifield says that Home sat, or crouched, low in a low chair, and that the \"spirit-hand\" was a false limb on the end of Home's arm. At other times, he says, he saw that Home was using his foot.\"Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. (1930). Some Thoughts on D. D. Home. Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. Volume 114.

In 1895, after the deaths of Robert and Elizabeth, the journalist Frederick Greenwood alleged that Browning had told him that during the s\u00e9ance he had taken hold of a luminous object that appeared above the edge of the table, which turned out to be Home's naked foot.East Anglian Daily Times, 14 January 1895, quoting from an article by Greenwood in the Realm. Later Browning's son Robert, in a letter to the London Times, 5 December 1902, also referred to the incident, saying that Browning had caught hold of Home's foot under the table. The allegation was repeated by Harry Houdini and later writers.Harry Houdini. (2011 reprint edition). Originally published in 1924. A Magician Among the Spirits. Cambridge University Press. p. 42. .
