His work was mainly abstract, drawing upon nature for inspiration.\nBorn in London, he was educated at Haileybury. In 1933 he began work as a trainee in his family's laundry business. In 1937-38 he studied at Westminster School of Art, and 1938-40 at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and Oxford.   In the Second World War he was a conscientious objector, first working on land drainage in Oxfordshire, then looking after monkeys being studied by the zoologist Solly Zuckerman.\nHe settled in Zennor, Cornwall in 1945, and in 1946 was co-founder of the Crypt Group. He married Suzanne Lethbridge, daughter of the writer Mabel Lethbridge whom he met in Cornwall.  He taught at Bath Academy of Art, Corsham, 1951-56.  He was a member of the London Group of artists, and of the Penwith Society of Arts.  He died at Penzance, Cornwall.  His auction record is \u00a3131,000 for his painting In the Streams Path (1958), set at Sotheby's on 11 November, 2016.  The work had been acquired by the pop star David Bowie in 1995 at the sale of the collection of Sir John Moores.\nIn 2001 he was the subject of Bryan Wynter: A Selected Retrospective at Tate St Ives.Some of his most remarkable works are constructions which he titled IMOOS (Images Moving Out Onto Space). Using a parabolic mirror, he would hang contrasting pairs of painted shapes, which rotated freely. Their reversed reflections enlarged, appearing to move in opposite directions.", "link_mentions": {}}}
