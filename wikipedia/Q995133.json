His work was mainly abstract, drawing upon nature for inspiration.\nBorn in London, he was educated at Haileybury. In 1933 he began work as a trainee in his family's laundry business. In 1937-38 he studied at Westminster School of Art, and 1938-40 at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and Oxford.   In the Second World War he was a conscientious objector, first working on land drainage in Oxfordshire, then looking after monkeys being studied by the zoologist Solly Zuckerman.\nHe settled in Zennor, Cornwall in 1945, and in 1946 was co-founder of the Crypt Group. He married Suzanne Lethbridge, daughter of the writer Mabel Lethbridge whom he met in Cornwall.  He taught at Bath Academy of Art, Corsham, 1951-56.  He was a member of the London Group of artists, and of the Penwith Society of Arts.  He died at Penzance, Cornwall.  His auction record is \u00a3131,000 for his painting In the Streams Path (1958), set at Sotheby's on 11 November, 2016.  The work had been acquired by the pop star David Bowie in 1995 at the sale of the collection of Sir John Moores.\nIn 2001 he was the subject of Bryan Wynter: A Selected Retrospective at Tate St Ives.Some of his most remarkable works are constructions which he titled IMOOS (Images Moving Out Onto Space). Using a parabolic mirror, he would hang contrasting pairs of painted shapes, which rotated freely. Their reversed reflections enlarged, appearing to move in opposite directions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cornwall", "response": ["Since the 19th century, Cornwall, with its unspoilt maritime scenery and strong light, has sustained a vibrant visual art scene of international renown. Artistic activity within Cornwall was initially centred on the art-colony of Newlyn, most active at the turn of the 20th century. This Newlyn School is associated with the names of Stanhope Forbes, Elizabeth Forbes, Norman Garstin and Lamorna Birch. Modernist writers such as D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf lived in Cornwall between the wars, and Ben Nicholson, the painter, having visited in the 1920s came to live in St Ives with his then wife, the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, at the outbreak of the Second World War. They were later joined by the Russian emigrant Naum Gabo, and other artists. These included Peter Lanyon, Terry Frost, Patrick Heron, Bryan Wynter and Roger Hilton. St Ives also houses the Leach Pottery, where Bernard Leach, and his followers championed Japanese inspired studio pottery. Much of this modernist work can be seen in Tate St Ives. The Newlyn Society and Penwith Society of Arts continue to be active, and contemporary visual art is documented in a dedicated online journal."]}, {"page": "Mescaline", "response": ["*Bryan Wynter produced Mars Ascends after trying the substance his first time.Bird, Michael. \"100 Ideas that Changed Art.\" London: Laurence King Publishing, 2012.

The poem moved on from his earlier style and moved away from the neo-romantic/apocalyptic tag. Unfortunately for the poet, the poem's appearance coincided with the rise of the Movement with their open hostility to the neo-romantics.

Prompted by a mixture of frustration at the indifference shown in Ireland to his work, an attraction to the sense of freedom he felt among the artists in Cornwall, and an engagement with the attempt to represent natural forms current in their abstraction, he settled in St Ives in 1960. While he was strongly influenced by the St Ives artistic community, his relationship was one of engagement rather than direct participation. His painting never completely assimilated the rigour and formality of the British abstract painters; it retained a muscular extravagance which is central to his artistic identity.

The School was now recognized as a centre for the Diploma in Art & Design, with Painting as a main course. Recognition for sculpture was to follow shortly.
