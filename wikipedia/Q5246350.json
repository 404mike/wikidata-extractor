He earned his first win as a four-year-old in March 2002 in a two-mile race at Catterick Bridge Racecourse in Catterick Bridge. After moderate success in hurdling races, Collier Hill began to show promise in flat racing, focusing on events where he could use his demonstrated ability at middle to long distances. In 2004, he won a Listed race at Hamilton Park Racecourse in Scotland, then earned his first significant victory when his handlers entered him in the Group 3 Stockholm Cup International at Taby Racecourse in Sweden. He was ridden by 45-year-old journeyman jockey Dean McKeown, who rode him for the rest of his career. Having handled travelling well, Collier Hill was sent to compete at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai in early 2005, where he won a turf handicap and ran third in the Group 1 Dubai Sheema Classic.

Twelve days after his defeat at Newbury, Mister Baileys was moved up in class for the Group Three Vintage Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. He was able to reverse the Newbury form, taking the lead two furlongs out and winning by two and  half lengths from Prince Babar, with Classic Sky fourth. In August, Mister Baileys was a disappointing favourite when finishing sixth behind Turtle Island in the Gimcrack Stakes. McKeown dropped his whip in the closing stages, but Mister Baileys appeared to be well beaten at the time. On his final start of the season, Mister Baileys was ridden by Frankie Dettori in the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot Racecourse.

The Racecall Gold Trophy, a handicap race run over six furlongs at Redcar Racecourse on 27 October was one of the most valuable juvenile races in Europe and attracted a field of twenty-four runners. Unlike a conventional handicap, the weights were determined by the prices fetched by the offspring of the runners sires at auction, giving an advantage to the progeny of cheap or unfashionable stallions. The race was run in exceptionally testing conditions on very heavy ground on a cold, wet day. Ridden by Dean McKeown and carrying 117 pounds Pips Pride was made the 6/1 second favourite.
