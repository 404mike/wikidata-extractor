In order to gain first-team experience he spent time out on loan at Colchester United, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday (twice). He broke into Wolves' first team in 2012\u201313, and was made captain by Kenny Jackett for the 2013\u201314 season as Wolves won the League One title, with Batth being named in the PFA Team of the Year.\nBatth remained a key member of the Wolves team as the play-offs were narrowly missed in 2014\u201315 before promotion to the Premier League was gained in 2017\u201318. After not being considered by Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo for his Premier League squad, Batth joined Middlesbrough on loan in August 2018.
