Both his name and the group's name are parodies of the famous guitarist Eric Clapton, and a play on the fact that he is a \"klepto of tones\" (that is, he \"steals\" others' music).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Kleptones (DJ)", "response": ["#REDIRECT The Kleptones"]}, {"page": "Kleptones", "response": ["#REDIRECT The Kleptones"]}, {"page": "A Night at the Hip Hopera", "response": ["A Night at the Hip Hopera is the third album by The Kleptones.
