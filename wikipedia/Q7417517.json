The league then took a winter break of almost three months, not resuming until almost the end of March.  The club continued to strengthen their attacking options by recruiting three additional forwards from Scotland; Sandy Wallace, John Scott and resigning former player James Duncan.  William Calder and Harry Munro were both allowed to join Gainsborough Trinity, before United resumed their league campaign with a 4\u20133 loss away at Newcastle West End who were struggling at the bottom of the table.  This signalled a down\u2013turn in form and inconsistent results until the end of the season meant that United lost touch with the top of the table and eventually finished third."]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["|Sandy Wallace"]}]}}
