Her most famous work was her utopian novel A Description of Millenium Hall and the Country Adjacent, followed closely by the sequel The History of Sir George Ellison.", "Sarah's father, Matthew Robinson, and her mother, Elizabeth Drake, were both from distinguished families, and Sarah was the youngest of nine children. Although born in Yorkshire, she spent much time with her siblings in Cambridge, England, where her grandmother, Sarah Morris Drake, lived with her stepgrandfather, Dr. Conyers Middleton, a famous scholar at Cambridge University. All but one of her brothers would go on to a highly accomplished career, yet her elder sister, who would later become the writer and social activist Elizabeth Montagu,  became the most accomplished, earning fame in literary circles as a critic of Shakespeare and founder of the Bluestockings, of which Sarah also became a member. The sisters were emotionally close in their early years.  Although Elizabeth was much more acclaimed as an author, Elizabeth often considered Sarah to be \"superior in certain respects, particularly intellectual and literary interests, in which she encouraged her.\"Kelly, Gary. \"Scott, Sarah (1720\u20131795).\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

She produced no more published works in her lifetime.  After a lengthy illness, Sarah died on 11 November 1795 in Catton, Norwich.  Per instructions Sarah left, most of her letters were destroyed by executor of her estate.  By the 19th\u00a0century, her name was largely forgotten, and her works were attributed to other writers, including novelist and playwright Oliver Goldsmith. Renewed interest in Sarah Scott and her work has emerged in recent literary criticism."]}, {"page": "Historiography of Romanisation", "response": ["Webster's main works regarding Romanisation are her articles \"Creolisation\" (2016), \"Rome and the 'Barbarians'\" (2007), \"A negotiated syncretism: readings on the development of Romano-Celtic religion\" (1997), \"Necessary comparisons: a post-colonial approach to religious syncretism in the Roman provinces\" (1997) and her books Roman imperialism and provincial art (2003, with Sarah Scott) and Roman imperialism: post-colonial perspectives (1996)."]}]}}
