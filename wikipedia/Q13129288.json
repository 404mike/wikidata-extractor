From the Abstract Art of Brendan Stuart Burns or Martyn Jones, to the expressive, modern figurative art of Shani Rhys James or Clive Hicks-Jenkins, from the politically charged work of Iwan Bala or Ivor Davies to the Pop Art of Ken Elias. The contemporary art of Wales is noted perhaps more for its variety, rather than having a single set agenda. However, perhaps due to market forces or the inspirational shapes and changing light, the Welsh landscape is still particularly well represented in commercial galleries throughout Wales and beyond, either through the expressive, almost abstract, techniques used by artists like David Tress or the more traditional approaches used by others like Rob Piercy."]}, {"page": "Construction in Process", "response": ["* Iwan Bala"]}, {"page": "Cardiff School of Art & Design", "response": ["*Iwan Bala, Gold Medal winner at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1997"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh artists", "response": ["*Iwan Bala (born 1956), painter and mixed media artist, winner of the National Eisteddfod of Wales Gold Medal for fine art in 1997"]}, {"page": "Mary Lloyd Jones", "response": ["Lloyd Jones's work is greatly inspired by the landscape in which she grew up, a prominent feature of which is the scarred landscape associated with a legacy of lead mining. This sense of place is further augmented by her own Welsh-language cultural inheritance. Ann Price-Owen has referred to her work as that of a custodian of her cultural heritage, which is implicitly language-based. Experiences outside Wales have also provided key stages in her work's development. An interest in early alphabets was precipitated by a visit to Ilkley Moor to view cup and ring marks. Incorporation of such marks into the work led to an identification with the 18th-century Welsh bard, scholar and antiquarian Iolo Morganwg, who created his own bardic alphabet, \"Coelbren\". She regards the use of scripts such as the ancient ogham script in her work as an oblique reference to the otherness of Welshness. Iwan Bala argues that these works demand some form of contextualising, revealing the artist's concerns and her position within her own culture. In the Summer of 2009 Ruthin Craft Centre showed Lloyd Jones's early textile work, which led to a re-evaluation of this work by a new audience. A second show in 2013 was reviewed in the magazine Embroidery. In February 2013 she was awarded the first Artist Residency at the Old College, Aberystwyth University, and moved into a new studio there. Some of her paintings are in the public collections of the National Library of Wales, Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales and Cardiff University."]}, {"page": "Locws international", "response": ["The artists commissioned for Locws 1 which ran from 2 September to 1 October 2000 were: Eric Angels, Iwan Bala, Maud Cotter, Dorothy Cross, Tim Davies, Peter Finnemore, Rose Frain, Hughes Germain, David Hastie, Karen Ingham, Philip Napier, Tina O\u2019Connoll, Benoit Sire, Lois Williams, Craig Wood."]}, {"page": "Christine Kinsey", "response": ["Words and poetry have always been an important influence in Kinsey\u2019s work.

The exhibition included work by 14 contemporary artists based in Wales including Kinsey, Osi Rhys Osmond, Iwan Bala, Ivor Davies and Mary Lloyd Jones. The catalogue for the exhibition included poetry by Menna Elfyn and Myrddin ap Dafydd. Later the same year, the exhibition was then amalgamated by curator Lynne Crompton with work from artists responding to Dylan Thomas at Oriel Q Gallery, Narberth. At an event to mark R. S. Thomas\u2019 centenary in 2013, Kinsey was invited by event organisers the University of Wales Press and Swansea University professor M Wynn Thomas (R. S. Thomas\u2019 biographer and executor of his literary estate) to talk about the ways in which the poetry of R. S. Thomas has influenced her art."]}, {"page": "Bala (name)", "response": ["* Iwan Bala (born 1956), Welsh Artist"]}, {"page": "Y Lle Celf", "response": ["In 2013 the Gold Medal for Fine Art was won by video artist Josephine Sowden, despite her work using English language based gibberish and seemingly flouting a language rule dating back to 1950.
