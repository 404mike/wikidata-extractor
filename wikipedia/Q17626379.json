With the exception of Phillips, who was in bad health, they met on 7 July at 40 Wimpole Street, the Herringham's London home: others invited were John Postle Heseltine, Charles Holroyd, John Bowyer Buchanan Nichols, Robert Clermont Witt and Lord Balcarres. They represented business (Heseltine) and politics (Balcarres) as well as the art world. Balcarres gravitated to the position of chairman of a provisional committee, and Herringham provided some working funds, but there were tensions: between Herringham and her cousin Witt, and over the participation of other women. At the first General Meeting of the Fund in November, Fry moved a protest amendment, seconded by Herringham, aimed at the exclusion of key early founders from the executive committee. Balcarres tried hard to smooth over the schism between Witt and Isidore Spielmann on one side, and Fry, MacColl and Phillips on the other. With these issues barely contained backstage, Heseltine set out to acquire the Rokeby Venus for the National Gallery, London, the purchase that established the Fund in British cultural life. In 1904 Herringham was one of the backers found by Fry to re-finance The Burlington Magazine."]}, {"page": "List of works about Rembrandt", "response": ["* Campbell, Louise (2014), 'Drawing Attention: John Postle Heseltine, the Etching Revival and Dutch Art of the Age of Rembrandt,'.
