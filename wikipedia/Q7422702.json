In Peter Ackroyd's novel The House of Doctor Dee (1993), the character Dr Dee, broadly based upon the historical figure of the occultist John Dee, claims that London Stone is the last remnant above ground of a glorious antediluvian and now buried city of London that he is searching for. London Stone appears as an embodiment of evil in Charlie Fletcher's trilogy for children Stoneheart (2006\u20132008). It also features in The Midnight Mayor (2010), Kate Griffin's second Matthew Swift novel about urban magic in London, and in China Mi\u00e9ville's Kraken (2010), in which it is the beating heart of London and the sports shop that (at the time Mi\u00e9ville was writing) housed it hides the headquarters of the \"Londonmancers\" who may know the whereabouts of the Kraken stolen from the Natural History Museum. The third of a series of fantasy novels for children The Nowhere Chronicles by Sarah Pinborough, writing as Sarah Silverwood, is entitled The London Stone (2012): \"The London Stone has been stolen and the Dark King rules the Nowhere...\" And in Marie Brennan's Onyx Court series (2008\u20132011), the Stone is part of the magical bond between the mortal Prince of the Stone and the fairie court beneath London.
