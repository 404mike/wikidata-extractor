His performances are known to combine many disparate elements, from satirical comedy to painting, surrealism and even striptease, much of which is aggressive in nature. Himself homosexual, Hoyle's work has often focused on themes in the LGBTQ community, attacking what he sees as dominant trends in \"bourgeois Britain and the materialistic-hedonistic gay scene\". According to The Guardian his performances have led him to become \"something of a legend\" on the London cabaret circuit.Born into a lower-middle-class background in Layton, Blackpool, Lancashire, Hoyle was heavily bullied for his homosexuality as a child, leading to a mental breakdown aged fourteen. He began performing at a local working men's club before moving to London and then Manchester. It was here that he began performing at gay clubs in the city in the early 1990s, eventually developing the character known as The Divine David, an \"anti-drag queen\" who combined \"lacerating social commentary\" with \"breathtaking instances of self-recrimination and even self-harm.\" Eventually taking his character to television, he appeared on the BBC's Comedy Nation (1998) and produced two shows for Channel 4, The Divine David Presents (1998) and then The Divine David Heals (2000). That year, he decided to bring an end to The Divine David character, performing a farewell show at Streatham Ice Arena entitled The Divine David on Ice.\nRetreating from his public appearances, Hoyle returned to his home in Manchester where he suffered from a mental breakdown that lasted several years. In 2005 he returned to television, appearing as the character Doug Rocket on Channel 4 sitcom Nathan Barley, and the next year he returned to the stage, performing as himself in a show entitled David Hoyle's SOS. Over the next few years he continued with a string of shows, most of which were held at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London, and which included Magazine (2007), Dave's Drop-In (2009), Licking Wounds (2010) and Lives (2011). In 2010 he also released his own feature film, Uncle David, in which he both directed and starred.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blackpool", "response": ["* David Hoyle \u2013 performance artist"]}, {"page": "Velvet Goldmine", "response": ["* David Hoyle as Freddi"]}, {"page": "Justin Vivian Bond", "response": ["In June 2006, Bond appeared with David Hoyle in When David Met Justin at London's Bush Hall.Walters 2010.

These actions were called \"zaps\", intended to reduce the rallies to a farcical shambles.  The Festival of Light was the most notable of these.  One of those who embraced this style of activism was Bette Bourne, the message of gay liberation being couched in comedy, song, tap routines and make-up.  \"We were finding a new way of doing drag that wasn't offensive to women, that wasn't about false tits and distasteful jokes. We saw ourselves as a new type of man. We could wear frocks and make-up and be silly and funny, but we had a serious message, too.\" This began a tradition of drag continued through the work of performers like David Hoyle down, a style of drag, separate from the aggressive form of \"female impersonation\".

The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family.

Attending the screening was Steve Marmion, the boss of Soho Theatre, who suggested to Reich and Hoyle that they produce a theatrical adaptation of the film. They initially showed an interest in the project; Reich commented that \"It was a very mischievous concept, doing an upbeat, life-affirming song-and-dance musical with that storyline and subject matter.\" However, the theatrical adaptation never surfaced, something Thomas attributed to the difficulty in obtaining funding for a musical on such a \"dark subject.\" Instead, Hoyle and Thomas teamed up to produce Merrie Hell, an \"alternative Christmas celebration\" that appeared at the Soho Theatre in December 2012. A two-man cabaret that differed every night, it featured Thomas on a piano, accompanying Hoyle's rendition of various songs about Christmas and Britain's societal problems; Thomas described it as \"David Hoyle at Christmas \u2013 the Musical\".
