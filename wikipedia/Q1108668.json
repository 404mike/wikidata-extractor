However, Colin Sell now usually fills this role. He is often the butt of jokes about his musical ability to which he is unable to respond as he has no microphone.  For example: \"When music experts hear Colin's compositions, they say he could have been another Berlin, Porter or anybody else employed by the German State Railway.\" Guest pianists are called in when Sell has been unable to attend (or the ISIHAC team have \"won the coin toss\" as Lyttelton once said on the show), including Neil Innes, Denis King and Matthew Scott. Lyttelton's band also appeared on a couple of Christmas specials. Once when Innes was guesting Lyttelton outlined the musician's career, concluding that this \"has brought him to where he is today: standing in for Colin Sell.\" In another appearance Innes sang along to his own composition \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\" during a round of \"Pick Up Song\".", "Many games are played on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, some frequently and dozens less often. A few have been played only once, either because the joke works only once or because they were not particularly successful. Popular games include \"One Song to the Tune of Another\", \"Mornington Crescent\", \"Sound Charades\", \"Late Arrivals\", \"Double Feature\", \"Cheddar Gorge\" and \"Uxbridge English Dictionary\". \"One Song to the Tune of Another\" is always introduced using a complex analogy, despite its self-explanatory title, often ending with a joke at the expense of Colin Sell.", "The regular panellists are represented by the chairman to be unfunny, struggling comedians who have been doing the same act for many years. Further to this, supposed personalities of the panellists by the chairman, fictitious but drawn from their public personas, is also a recurring theme, with Barry Cryer often represented as a tight-fisted alcoholic who can't wait to get to the pub (but who never buys a round of drinks), whilst Tim Brooke-Taylor was often represented as willing to take any small performance job in his quiet career, and always campaigning for a repeat of The Goodies (something which Brooke-Taylor himself played upon in many rounds). The late Humphrey Lyttelton often delivered mock comments of how boring and low quality the show was and, particularly in his later years on the show, often preferring to doze off than listen to the rounds. Pianist Colin Sell, meanwhile, is often the butt of many jokes regarding his supposedly terrible musical skills (despite in reality being an accomplished musician).", "*4th Series (1975) \u2013 29 July\u201316 September [8 episodes] (Colin Sell's first appearance, Graeme mentions 'Gordon Bennett' for the first time as a late arrival and the name 'Pick-Up Song' is used but a different game.)", "A ninth tour was announced in October 2019 to take place in early 2020. Jack Dee, Colin Sell and Tim Brooke-Taylor were joined by Tony Hawks and Miles Jupp on the panel, with the fourth spot rotating between Rory Bremner, Richard Osman and John Finnemore.

(British TV series)", "response": ["In 1988, Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson approached the BBC with a concept for a new comedy programme, involving a group of performers conducting games that encompassed improvisational comedy. The title of their concept was a comedic riposte to the radio programme What's My Line, which had recently moved to a television format, merged to the title of a 1972 play, Whose Life Is It Anyway?. Their pitch was well liked by the broadcaster, who green-lighted a radio programme for broadcast on BBC Radio 4, commissioning six episodes. Both Patterson and Leveson opted for it to be presented by Clive Anderson, with both John Sessions and Stephen Fry joining him as regular performers in each episode, and music being provided by Colin Sell."]}, {"page": "BBC Television Shakespeare", "response": ["For this production, director David Giles chose to go with a stylised setting, which he referred to as both \"emblematic\" and \"heraldic.\" The music was written by Colin Sell.

During her time there she acted in departmental productions and learnt the guitar. In 1968, she and her friend Maureen Purkis took part in the play I am not the Eiffel Tower with music composed by Colin Sell, an accomplished young pianist who was studying Spanish and Portuguese at Bristol and who has gone on to appear in BBC Radio 4's I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. Sell's roommate Malcolm Donaldson, a medical student who played left-handed guitar and was a keen amateur actor, came to see the show and subsequently teamed up with Sell, Donaldson and Purkis to sing in the pubs during Bristol University Rag Week in early 1969. Almost immediately after this Donaldson and Purkis were seconded to live in Paris for six months as part of their degree course where they sang and played their guitars to caf\u00e9 audiences for money. Malcolm joined them in the summer and the trio performed various songs by the Beatles and from musicals including Hair.", "The couple were married in September 1972, Donaldson composing an operetta which she and Malcolm, their best man Colin Sell, the bridesmaids and ushers performed at the reception in Burgh House, Hampstead. A picture of the wedding is on display in the house today. Donaldson then worked as a secretary in Radio Bristol where she also had a weekly slot as short story producer/editor. In August 1974 the couple moved to Brighton where Donaldson had been appointed as editor at Robert Tyndall, a small book publishers. Shortly before this she had sent a tape of songs to BBC Children's Television, and between 1974 and 1978 she wrote regularly for the programme Play Away, her songs being performed by actors and musicians including Toni Arthur, Floella Benjamin, Johnny Ball, Brian Cant, Derek Griffiths and musical director Jonathan Cohen. She also wrote occasional songs for Play School and for the Watch with Mother programme Play Board.

Hall made her first appearance on the show when it moved to the United States for its final series, and she appeared on six of the UK series' episodes."]}, {"page": "List of games on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue", "response": ["Panellists attempt to sing a song perfectly in tune while Colin Sell plays wrong notes, changes key and changes tempo. The name is a play on The Well-Tempered Clavier, and the game is identical to an exercise used by the father of the composer Charles Ives to train his son. Points are deducted from players who attempt to sing with their fingers in both ears.", "In this round, Colin Sell starts playing a song, which is a clue to a joke which Jack Dee has on his card. The teams' job is to buzz in, identify the song and tell a joke relating to the song. If everyone has incorrectly guessed the joke, Colin then proceeds to play another song as another clue. This continues until the joke has been correctly identified, or no one guesses correctly after three songs have been played, in which case Jack will tell the correct joke instead.", "The Plasma Display Board (upgraded from the old laser display screen) shows the name of a well known song, which the audience must hum, following an unrelated piano introduction from Colin Sell. Panellists simply have to identify the song. The fun of this song comes from the audience's self-conscious attempts to remain in time, often obscuring the song completely. The audience is left to its own devices regarding when to begin, and which part of the song to do. Most memorably, the audience once had to give a rendition of \"Funky Gibbon\", a hit for The Goodies, of which Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor were members. Another notable round was recorded in Leeds, Yorkshire, where the tune was Flight of the Bumblebee; for this, instead of humming the tune, the whole audience simply buzzed and Graeme Garden guessed \"Flight of the Warthog\".", "In One Song to the Tune of Another, panellists sing the lyrics of a song to the tune of a completely different one.

This translates on radio to several minutes of Sell playing tunes on the piano, before shrieking in pain as the tail is pinned on him.

In more recent series, Colin Sell would start playing on the piano, forcing Cryer to improvise a song on the spot based upon the link he had found."]}, {"page": "Adaptations of A Christmas Carol", "response": ["* I'm Sorry I Haven't a Christmas Carol (2003), a Christmas special for the BBC Radio 4 panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, with central character Ebenezer Scrumph (Humphrey Lyttelton) and assistant Colin Crotchet (Colin Sell)."]}, {"page": "1948 in British music", "response": ["*1 December \u2013 Colin Sell, pianist"]}, {"page": "Revunions", "response": ["*Colin Sell"]}]}}
