During his career Boehm maintained a large studio in London and produced a significant volume of public works and private commissions. A speciality of Boehm's was the portrait bust; there are many examples of these in the National Portrait Gallery. He was often commissioned by the Royal Family and members of the aristocracy to make sculptures for their parks and gardens. His works were many, and he exhibited 123 of them at the Royal Academy from 1862 to his death in 1890. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Bunyan", "response": ["In 1874, a bronze statue of John Bunyan, sculpted by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, was erected in Bedford.  This stands at the south-western corner of St Peter's Green, facing down Bedford's High Street.  The site was chosen by Boehm for its significance as a crossroads. Bunyan is depicted expounding the Bible, to an invisible congregation, with a broken fetter representing his imprisonment by his left foot.  There are three scenes from \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" on the stone plinth: Christian at the wicket gate; his fight with Apollyon; and losing his burden at the foot of the cross of Jesus.

Boehm's rendering proved unpopular, and in 1893 was replaced with the \"Veiled head\" or \"Old head\", by Thomas Brock, and engraved by Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles. The new penny design was introduced in 1895, the new version being authorised by a proclamation dated 11 May of that year. Victoria is seen as an elderly woman, wearing a diadem partially eclipsed by a veil. She wears a necklace with a pendant, an earring, and the Garter Riband with Star. The inscription became VICTORIA DEI GRA BRITT REGINA FID DEF IND IMP, as the title of Empress of India had been added to the Queen's titles in 1876. The reverse was modified by de Saulles, with the most significant change the deletion of the ship and lighthouse. The new design was struck each year from 1895 to 1901, the year in which Victoria died.

Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master.

It was presented to Mary Mundella at a ceremony in Manchester in August 1884, ten years after the Factory Act had passed. The bust remained in the family until some time after 1938 when it was presented to the Nottingham School Board for display in the Mundella Grammar School. When this school closed in 1985 the bust passed to Roland Green School and then The Nottingham Emmanuel School. It was then taken into the care of a group of former students of Nottingham Grammar School, who in 2009 had it cleaned and loaned it to the Bromley House Library, Nottingham where it is now displayed.
