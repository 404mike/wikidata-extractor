An accountant as a young man, his means were such that he was able to pursue his interests as a naturalist and antiquarian. He was a member of a number of societies, often assuming leadership positions. Hudd is perhaps best known for his roles as author of Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District, editor of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, supervisor of the excavations undertaken by the Caerwent Exploration Fund, and author of \"Richard Ameryk and the name America.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of continent name etymologies", "response": ["An alternative theory was proposed by the local Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd who proposed that the word America had evolved from Amerike or ap Meryk, based on a lost manuscript which he claimed to have seen. Alfred Hudd was an aristocrat who belonged to the Clifton Antiquarian Club of Bristol, founded in 1884 to arrange meetings and excursions for the study of objects of archaeological interest in the West of England and South Wales. He also collected butterflies, was a naturalist and member of the Bristol Naturalists' Society. Hudd proposed that the word \"America\" was originally applied to a destination across the western ocean, possibly an island or a fishing station in Newfoundland. After the king of Denmark and ruler of Iceland had cut off trade for fish, England sent out expeditions to find new sources. Hudd suggested Amerike's sponsorship made his name known in Bristol in association with the North American destinations prior to other mapmaking or voyages. The writer Jonathan Cohen noted he made a conjectural leap to reach that conclusion, and no extant evidence supports it.Jonathan Cohen, \"The naming of America: fragments we've shored against ourselves\", early version appeared in American Voices, 1998; this version at his website at Stony Brook University, accessed 10 July 2011 In the 21st century, the scholar John Davies briefly mentioned the story as a kind of Welsh patriot piece."]}, {"page": "Richard Amerike", "response": ["Richard ap Meryk, anglicised to Richard Amerike (or Ameryk) ( 1440\u20131503) was an Anglo-Welsh merchant, royal customs officer and, at the end of his life, sheriff of Bristol. Several claims have been made for Amerike by popular writers of the late twentieth century. One was that he was the major funder of the voyage of exploration launched from Bristol by the Venetian John Cabot in 1497, and that Amerike was the owner of Cabot's ship, the Matthew.  The other claim revived a theory first proposed in 1908 by a Bristolian scholar and amateur historian, Alfred Hudd. Hudd's theory, greatly elaborated by  later writers, suggested that the continental name America was derived from Amerike's surname in gratitude for his sponsorship of Cabot's successful discovery expedition to the 'New World'.  However, neither claim is backed up by hard evidence, and the consensus view is that America is named after Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer.", "Richard Amerike did have one important responsibility towards John Cabot. Amerike, and his fellow customs officer, Arthur Kemys, were the paymasters for the pension of \u00a320 a year granted by Henry VII to John Cabot on 13 December 1497. Cabot's grant specified that he was to be paid out of revenues arising from the customs dues payable to the Crown on goods exported and imported in the port of Bristol by way of merchandise.Condon M. and Jones, E. T. 'The grant of a pension of \u00a320 per year to John Cabot, 13 December 1497', University of Bristol, Explore Bristol Research.  Accessed March 2016. Amerike and Kemys were responsible for collecting those revenues and accounting for them to the Exchequer at Westminster. Local payment in Bristol made a lot of sense for the explorer and, provided all the documentation was in order, Amerike and Kemys would then be able to claim the payment to Cabot as a legitimate expense when they accounted for their revenues in the Exchequer at the end of the accounting year.Condon. M and Jones E.T., 'Warrant for the payment of John Cabot's pension, 22 February 1498', University of Bristol, Explore Bristol Research.  Accessed March 2016. In the mid-1890s Edward Scott, a 'Keeper' or senior archivist at the British Museum, and from 1891 Keeper of the Muniments in Westminster Abbey, discovered a stray Exchequer document that showed this process and two years-worth of pension payments to Cabot by Amerike and his colleague in 1497\u20131499. In 1897 the document was published in transcript and facsimile by Scott and the Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd. Kemys and 'Richard ap Meryke' or 'a Meryk' are named at the head of every section of the account.  The 'Cabot Roll' remains an important discovery for the history of John Cabot.James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (Hakluyt Society, Series II, vol 120 1962), pp. 102\u201303, 218\u201319", "In 1908, the local Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd first proposed the theory that the word America had evolved from Amerike or ap Meryk. Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's Proceedings.  Hudd's speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author, who expanded Hudd's argument with speculations about the voyages of the Matthew and later trade with the Eastern seaboard, which Amerike is known to have had financial interests in. It is proposed that as a main investor, Amerike's name would have been noted on ships' rutters or working charts, indicating the locations where his cargo had been traded. It is further supposed that such secret documents could have been seized by Spanish explorers when a British voyage was mysteriously lost during the same period that Amerigo Vespucci was mapping the coast of Brazil -this information later reaching Waldseem\u00fcller. However, this cannot be verifiably proved unless original documents come to light.Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480\u20131508 (University of Bristol, Nov. 2016), chapter 8 'The naming of the land', pp. 71\u201377 The consensus view continues to be that America is named after Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer.John W.

Richard ap Meryk, anglicised to Richard Amerike (or Ameryk) ( 1445\u20131503) was a wealthy Anglo-Welsh merchant, royal customs officer and sheriff of Bristol. According to some historians, he was the principal owner of the Matthew, the ship sailed by John Cabot during his voyage of exploration to North America in 1497. The idea that Richard Amerike was a 'principal supporter' of Cabot has gained popular currency in the 21st century. There is no known evidence to support this. Similarly, and contrary to a recent tradition that names Amerike as principal owner and main funder of the Matthew, Cabot's ship of 1497, academic enquiry does not connect Amerike with the ship. Her ownership at that date remains uncertain.Evan T. Jones, \"The Matthew of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot's 1497 voyage to North America\", English Historical Review (2006) Macdonald asserts that the caravel was specifically built for the Atlantic crossing."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London", "response": ["*Alfred Hudd (1846\u20131920)"]}, {"page": "Clifton Antiquarian Club", "response": ["==Alfred Hudd, Secretary==", "Hudd was also a member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society. In addition, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and was closely involved with the Caerwent Exploration Fund. At a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries in February 1899, Alfred Trice Martin, a founding member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, had proposed a systematic excavation of Caerwent, a Roman town in south Wales. The Caerwent Exploration Fund was established by the Clifton Antiquarian Club shortly thereafter, in 1899. In September of that year, at Caerwent, Godfrey Morgan, Lord Tredegar, was elected President of the Fund, and Alfred Hudd was elected Treasurer. Alfred Hudd and Thomas Ashby, Junior, both members of the Executive Committee of the Fund, supervised the excavations. During the period between 1899 and 1913, two-thirds of the Roman town was revealed. The archive of Caerwent, excavated by the Caerwent Exploration Fund, is in the archaeology collection of Newport Museum. The reports on the Caerwent excavation were published in Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries."]}]}}
