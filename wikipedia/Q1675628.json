Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as cryptids, a term coined by the subculture.

Founding members of the Fortean Society included Tiffany Thayer, Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Alexander Woollcott and many of New York's literati such as Dorothy Parker. But \"Fort had his share of detractors. His friend H. L. Mencken said his head was filled with 'Bohemian mush. Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller.  The first six issues of the Fortean Society's newsletter \"Doubt\" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser.  Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues.  Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society's direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean. During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of \"Doubt\" to espouse his politics.  Particularly, he frequently expressed opposition to Civil Defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens.  In contrast to the spirit of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed the atomic bomb as a hoax.\"Personalities in Science Fiction: Charles Fort: His Objects Fade in the West\", by Robert Barbour Johnson (If, July 1952)."]}, {"page": "Fortean Times", "response": ["Issue #21 had the debut of FT semiregular column \"Strange Deaths\" (later descriptively subtitled \"Unusual ways of shuffling off this mortal coil\"), while issue #22 updated FT's to include (Ivan T.
