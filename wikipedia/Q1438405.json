He played for various Scottish clubs before joining Bury. After spells in the United States and Ireland, Massie returned to Scottish football in 1930 with Heart of Midlothian. His performances there earned him selection for the Scotland national football team and the Scottish League XI. Massie moved to Aston Villa in 1935. After retiring as a player in 1945, Massie became the manager of Aston Villa. He later managed Torquay United and Hereford United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aston Villa F.C.", "response": ["Aston Villa won their sixth FA Cup in 1920, soon after though the club began a slow decline that led to Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, being relegated in 1936 for the first time to the Second Division. This was largely the result of a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenal's Ted Drake in an infamous 1\u20137 defeat at Villa Park.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 71. Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 75. The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s. Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956\u201357 season when another former Villa player, Eric Houghton led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of Manchester United in the final.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; pp. 86\u201387. The team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later, due in large part to complacency. However, under the stewardship of manager Joe Mercer Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the Football League Cup.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 93."]}, {"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["|1950\u20131951||Alex Massie"]}, {"page": "Heart of Midlothian F.C.", "response": ["Despite Walker scoring 192 league goals for Hearts and playing in sides boasting numerous internationals, such as Scots Dave McCulloch, Barney Battles, Andy Anderson and Alex Massie, Welshman Freddie Warren and Irishman Willie Reid, Walker was destined not to win a major honour as a player at Tynecastle.
