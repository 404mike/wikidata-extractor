She also became the first female driver to win a race in a series that formed part of the TOCA package, the first to win a mixed-gender series in the UK, and was awarded the BRDC Rising Star status. As a result of this, she was shortlisted for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award, eventually being ranked fifth. In addition to this, she was named as the British Club Driver of the Year at the Autosport Awards, and joined the YourRacingCar.com scheme. The owner of Ginetta Cars, Lawrence Tomlinson, praised Moore, stating \"Seeing Sarah go on stage at the awards in front of 1,400 industry heads has been one of the proudest moments in Ginetta's history.\""]}]}}
