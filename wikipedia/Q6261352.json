The clan's progenitors were an English trader and agent, John Tucker, and a Sherbro princess. Starting in the 17th century, the Tuckers ruled over one of the most powerful chiefdoms in the Sherbro country of Southern Sierra Leone, centered on the village of Gbap.", "In the 1620s, there were a number of European agents in the Sherbro region of Sierra Leone; these traders were looking for camwood, ivory, and other such items, and traded with the locals. They were also looking for slaves to fulfill a growing demand for slave labor in European colonies in the Americas. In the late 17th century, the Gambia Adventurers and the Royal African Company began sending many agents to the region. In 1665, an agent in the service of the Gambia Adventurers called John Tucker left England and went to Sierra Leone alongside Zachary Rogers (progenitor of the Afro-European clan the Rogers). Upon arriving in Sherbro Country, John Tucker and Zachary Rogers took the daughters of a Sherbro chief as their wives as was customary in order to gain trading rights in the region.", "Being a matrilineal society, the descendants of John Tucker were able to maintain claims to the chieftaincy throne. The children of John Tucker and the Sherbro princess gained control of their mother's kingdom and utilised their father's name. Politically, the Tuckers would become one of the most influential and prominent Sherbro families during the 17th and 18th centuries, and were able to expand their powerful chiefdom into other territories. Although they maintained European connections (some of them going to England to attend school), they remained thoroughly 'Africanised' taking part in local cultural institutions such as the Poro society. It was only through such local institutions that they were able to gain control over more territory."]}, {"page": "John Tucker", "response": ["John Tucker may refer to:", "*John Tucker (MP) (died 1779), British MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis", "*John Tucker (Tasmanian politician) (born 1975), Member for Lyons in the Tasmanian House of Assembly", "*John Tucker (American football) (1901\u20131983), American football player and coach, head coach at Arkansas Tech University, 1933\u20131947", "*John Tucker (ice hockey) (born 1964), Canadian NHL hockey player", "*John Tucker (lacrosse) (fl. 1976\u20132015), American lacrosse player and coach", "*John Tucker (merchant trader) (fl. 1665\u20131694), English slave trader for the Royal African Company from London, England", "*John Tucker, president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, 1844\u20131856", "*John Tucker Must Die, 2006 comedy film"]}, {"page": "John Tucker (Merchant Trader)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Tucker (merchant trader) "]}, {"page": "John Tucker (trader)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Tucker (merchant trader)"]}]}}
