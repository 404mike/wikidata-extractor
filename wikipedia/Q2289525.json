He is the distant cousin of Mr Bennet, a clergyman and holder of a valuable living at the Hunsford parsonage near Rosings Park, the estate of his patroness Lady Catherine De Bourgh, in Kent. Since Mr and Mrs Bennet have no sons, Mr Collins is also the current heir presumptive to the Bennet's family estate of Longbourn House, in Meryton, Hertfordshire. Mr Collins is first introduced during his visit to Longbourn, Mr Bennet's estate.  His dull-witted character is in parallel to another 'Austen' character, Mr. Rushworth, from Mansfield Park.  Mr Collins is also somewhat comparable to the Shakespearean character, Malvolio, from Twelfth Night.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pride and Prejudice", "response": ["* Mr William Collins\u00a0\u2013 Mr Collins is Mr Bennet's distant second cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate of Longbourn House.

As Mr & Mrs Bennett do not have a son, he is the entailed heir of their home and estate, Longbourn. He intends to marry a Bennet daughter as an act of benign goodwill to prevent Mrs Bennet and her unwed daughters being rendered homeless once Mr Collins inherits the estate. He therefore invites himself for a two-week visit to get to know the Bennets better and select a daughter to marry. However, the Bennet girls judge Mr Collins to be a rather ridiculous man, an \"oddity\" with many peculiarities of speech and deportment. They nevertheless treat him civilly and take him to balls and social events in Meryton. One day, while on a walk around Meryton village, they meet members of a newly arrived militia regiment, including a Mr George Wickham. At a social event, Wickham befriends Elizabeth and claims that his father was the steward for Darcy's late father, and that he originally planned to join the clergy. However, Darcy denied Wickham the \"living\" (a curacy) that Mr Darcy's father promised him. At a ball at Netherfield, Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance, which she grudgingly but politely accepts. Mrs Bennet tells Mr Collins that she expects Jane to soon be engaged, so he instead proposes to Elizabeth. She resoundingly rejects him. While Mrs Bennet reacts angrily to Elizabeth's decision, her close friend, Charlotte Lucas, invites Mr Collins to visit at Lucas Lodge.", "* David Bamber as Mr William Collins"]}, {"page": "Bride and Prejudice", "response": ["* Nitin Ganatra as Kohli Saab (Mr William Collins)"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Bennet", "response": ["Her father is a landowner, but his daughters cannot inherit because the estate is entailed upon the male line (it can only be inherited by male relatives).
