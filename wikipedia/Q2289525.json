He is the distant cousin of Mr Bennet, a clergyman and holder of a valuable living at the Hunsford parsonage near Rosings Park, the estate of his patroness Lady Catherine De Bourgh, in Kent. Since Mr and Mrs Bennet have no sons, Mr Collins is also the current heir presumptive to the Bennet's family estate of Longbourn House, in Meryton, Hertfordshire. Mr Collins is first introduced during his visit to Longbourn, Mr Bennet's estate.  His dull-witted character is in parallel to another 'Austen' character, Mr. Rushworth, from Mansfield Park.  Mr Collins is also somewhat comparable to the Shakespearean character, Malvolio, from Twelfth Night.", "link_mentions": {}}}
