He spent the whole of his League career \u2013 nineteen years \u2013 with Birmingham City, for whom he made 291 appearances and scored 72 goals in all competitions. The Second World War started when he was 22 years old, so his career was severely disrupted by the conflict, in which he served in the Royal Air Force in India and Burma. He also appeared as a guest player for West Ham United during the war. He was twice Birmingham's leading scorer, firstly in the 1946\u201347 season, despite playing a third of his matches at right back, and again in 1950\u201351, by which time he was exclusively a centre forward.He moved to Stourbridge in 1954 as player-coach, and retired in 1957.

He played football while in the Army as well as for home-town club Burton Albion, and had a reputation as a \"rough and tumble striker\", by the time Birmingham City signed him on professional forms on 13 November 1947. He was prolific in reserve-team football, scored in first-team friendlies in Scotland and Switzerland, and made his senior debut on 13 November 1948a year to the day after signingstanding in for Cyril Trigg. Ten minutes into the match, at home to Huddersfield Town in the First Division, he injured a leg in a tackle. He played on, in increasing discomfort, went to hospital after the match, and X-rays revealed a broken bone, just above the ankle. He said afterwards, \"I thought it was a bit painful, but had not realised it was as bad as that.\" He missed only four months of the season, but by the time he was fit again, Jimmy Dailey had taken over at centre forward. It was the first instance of what the Sports Argus dubbed \"an unhappy knack of bumping into trouble\". Over the next 18 months, he injured himself tripping on the stairs, twisted his ankle when he trod on a brick, and what he thought was \"just a cold\" had turned into pneumonia that left him hospitalised for weeks. He played just five first-team games for Birmingham, and was transfer-listed at the end of the 1950\u201351 season."]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-two players made at least one appearance in nationally organised competitive football during the season, and there were thirteen different goalscorers.
