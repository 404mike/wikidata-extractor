He was selected for the England A tour of Australia and Fiji in 1995 debuting against South Australia. In 1998 he went on his first full England tour to the Southern Hemisphere, but returned home uncapped. He made no further appearance for England until 2007 when he was selected for the mid-year test series in South Africa. Many spaces were made available on this tour as no Bath, Leicester Tigers or Wasps were selected by Brian Ashton due to Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup Final commitments. This meant that Crompton was selected for the tour at the age of 34, nine years after his first senior England tour, as a result of his form in the Premiership. Thus he was able to win his full England cap, when he took to the field during the first test against the Springboks in Bloemfontein as a replacement for Stuart Turner on 26 May 2007. Having already represented his country, Crompton was called up again to wear the rose this time for England Sevens, however he rejected the offer as he believed that sevens do not take scrums seriously."]}, {"page": "Caldy Rugby Football Club", "response": ["*  Stuart Turner (England)Sam Dickinson  (England Saxons)"]}, {"page": "2007 England rugby union tour of South Africa", "response": ["|align=right|BJ Botha||align=right|P||align=center|3||P||Stuart Turner", "|align=right| Deon Carstens||align=right|P||align=center|17||P||Stuart Turner "]}, {"page": "Stuart Turner (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stuart Turner (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "2007 Six Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Stuart Turner"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1285||Stuart Turner||(prop) ||2007-03-17||v Wales at Millennium Stadium"]}, {"page": "Stuart Turner", "response": ["Stuart Turner may refer to:", "*Stuart Turner (baseball) (born 1991), American baseball player", "*Stuart Turner (cricketer) (born 1943), English cricketer", "*Stuart Turner (engineer) (1869\u20131920), English engineer", "*Stuart Turner (musician), English alternative blues singer", "*Stuart Turner (rugby union) (born 1972), rugby union player", "*Stuart Turner (EastEnders), a fictional character", "*Stuart Turner (The Bill), a fictional character", "*Stuart Turner (company), British engineering company founded in 1906"]}, {"page": "2006 New Zealand rugby union tour", "response": ["|align=right|Stuart Turner||align=right| ||align=center|17||P||John Afoa  75' "]}, {"page": "2006 Argentina rugby union tour of Europe", "response": ["|align=right|Stuart Turner||align=right| ||align=center|17||P||Martin Scelzo  69' "]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Powergen Cup", "response": ["| ||17|| Stuart Turner"]}, {"page": "Leicester Tigers in cup finals", "response": ["|TP ||3 || Stuart Turner "]}]}}
