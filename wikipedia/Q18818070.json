They are shown all around the world, for example in the Tate Modern in London, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin and the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery.\nIn 2016 Simon Fujiwara showed shaved furs of animals in Tokyo, a multimedial biography of the Irish \"traitor\" Roger Casement in Dublin and the skin pigments of the German chancellor Angela Merkel, magnified by the factor of 1,000, in Berlin. In Bregenz (Austria) he built a replica of the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.\nFujiwara sees his art as a mixture of politics, architecture and his own biography. In the Tate St. Ives for example he reconstructed the bar of a hotel his parents ran in Spain when Simon was little. He charged the scene with erotic elements.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Leeds", "response": ["Works of public art on campus range from Eric Gill's controversial 1923 World War I memorial  Christ driving the Moneychangers from the Temple in the foyer of the Rupert Beckett Building to Simon Fujiwara's 2015  A Spire outside the Laidlaw Library and Liliane Lijn's 2019 Converse Column at the south east entrance to the campus.
