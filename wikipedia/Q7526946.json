John Ball was husband of Roberts sister Alice (d 1724) and they were probably living in Sedgefield and possibly in the Manor House Alice died in 1724 and John Ball may have continued living there until his death in 1732. Robert Wright made a title surrender which was probably the Manor House to John Ball for a payment of \u00a31600 plus interest on 10 October 1717.  George Wheler son of Sir George Wheler who was a canon of Durham Cathedral and rector of a school in Houghton le Spring.  On 12 May 1719 Robert Wright surrendered a title in Sedgefield to Sir George Wheler for a sum of \u00a3750 plus interest.  As the consideration for both of the surrenders to John Ball and Sir George Wheler included payment of interest it implies that the actual surrenders were expected to be at some point in the future which seem to indicate that Robert Wright was making his future plans. Charles Monson MP was deputy Paymaster General and brother of Lord Monson Commissioner for Trade and Plantations including those in Carolina and it is likely both were involved in arranging for Robert Wright to acquire a plantation when he arrived in Carolina in 1725.  Fourthly, John Cotton who was Lord Proprietor of Carolina and was likely involved in Robert Wright's appointment as Chief Justice of the colony.  The dispute concerning the ownership of the title of Robert Wrights mansion house was not resolved until 1756 in the Court of Chancery in London when the titles held by Robert Wright were sold and the title of the Manor House was bought by John Burdon of Hardwick Estate."]}, {"page": "Historical sources of the Crusades: pilgrimages and exploration", "response": ["George Wheler.
