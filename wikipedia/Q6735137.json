Despite this fact there was still some Welsh-language output, transmitted to all of the United Kingdom, including a daily news bulletin at 5pm. There were murmurs of disapproval in England to being forced to listen to Welsh broadcasts, but some productions made by the Welsh Region proved very popular, including Mai Jones' Welsh Rarebit. Another consequence of the war for Welsh radio was the relocation of much of the BBCs  department to the Bangor Studio, due to the risks of air raids on the cities of London and Bristol. This decision saw some of the biggest names in British entertainment arriving in north Wales, including Tommy Handley, Arthur Askey and Charlie Chester. The most successful show produced at Bangor during this period was Handley's It's That Man Again, which became the best-loved of all wartime programmes in Britain."]}, {"page": "List of people from Newport", "response": ["* Mai Jones (songwriter, entertainer and radio producer)"]}, {"page": "Gladys Morgan", "response": ["Morgan's big break came when she auditioned for the popular BBC radio variety show Welsh Rarebit.
