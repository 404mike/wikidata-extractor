The 6'4\" defender featured briefly during footage of the video \"Great Balls of Fire\" hosted by Vinny Jones when Fry was heard to shout \"We've got a giant, why don't you fucking use him!\" at one of his players.During an FA Cup tie, playing for then Division 3 Bristol Rovers against then Premiership Derby County he man marked Fabrizio Ravanelli, the former Italian international. Rovers won the tie 3\u20131 at Pride Park.\nA five-game loan spell at Wycombe Wanderers in the mid-1990s saw Foran voted by supporters as the worst ever player to represent the club. He did however return to haunt those who had given him this unwanted tag when he scored a headed goal against them whilst playing for Peterborough United.\nA compendium of injuries contributed to Foran's shortened career, suffering three broken legs including one while playing for Crewe reserves.\nHe drifted into semi-professional football in the early 2000s before retiring to pursue a career outside the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Aldershot", "response": ["* Mark Foran - footballer "]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Mark Foran"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Mark Foran, footballer, was born in Aldershot"]}, {"page": "Foran", "response": ["*Mark Foran, (born 1973), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Foran, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Foran"]}]}}
