He presented at the Royal Society and made an impression on its members in the 1660s and 1670s.\nBirchensha invented a system that he claimed would enable non-musicians to learn to compose in a short time by means of \"a few easy, certain, and perfect Rules\". This was at a time when other music theorists were codifying the rules of counterpoint, and writing about other rule-based and combinatorial systems to aid in the composition of music, such as the Arca Musarithmica of Athanasius Kircher. Information about his life and work remains scanty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Salmon (musicologist)", "response": ["Thomas Salmon was the son of Thomas Salmon of Hackney. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, on 8 April 1664, and graduated B.A. 1667, and M.A. 1670. At the university he mainly studied mathematics; Matthew Locke says that Salmon applied to him for instruction in musical composition. Locke disclaimed competence, referring Salmon to the Compendium of Practical Musick by Christopher Simpson, and suggested John Birchensha as a teacher."]}, {"page": "Arca Musarithmica", "response": ["Years later, his belongings, bequeathed to Cambridge, included an Arca. It is unclear if Pepys constructed or commissioned this, based on the instructions in the book, or if he purchased it or received it as a gift.  His diary makes no mention of it (he stopped recording entries in 1669).  It has been speculated that Pepy's music teacher John Birchensha was influenced by Kircher's combinatorial techniques, as his own \"Rules of Composition\" bear some similarities. Birchensha, John: Writings on Music] Field and Wardhaugh, editors, 2010, page 42  The Pepysian library does not currently keep their Arca out on display, and there are few photographs available of its contents."]}, {"page": "Birchensha, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Birchensha"]}]}}
