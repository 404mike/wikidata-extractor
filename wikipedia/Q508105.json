South Africa won the toss and chose to play into the wind in the first half, starting the game with a fine display of running rugby. On their first visit to the Irish half, they returned with points as their out half Andre Pretorius kicked a penalty into the wind. The Irish responded with a barging run by Denis Leamy who made the hard yards before passing to Ronan O'Gara, who then passed back inside to Andrew Trimble who found his way over for Ireland's first points."]}, {"page": "Culture of Northern Ireland", "response": ["* Andrew Trimble"]}, {"page": "Denis Hickie", "response": ["Hickie suffered many injuries throughout his career. In October 2005, in the week coming up to the European Cup, he dislocated his right fibula following a training ground accident and missed the autumn tests. This injury kept him out of the 2005 autumn international series and he subsequently lost his place on the Irish team to Ulster's Andrew Trimble for the duration of 2006, despite his excellent form for Leinster. This was best captured in his try in Leinster's Heineken Cup quarter-final match against Toulouse in France which saw him run the length of the pitch partnered by Gordon D'Arcy to score in the corner. An injury to Trimble saw Hickie retake the number 11 shirt for Ireland against Australia in the 2006 Autumn tests where he scored a notable try, beating four Australian defenders with his trademark 'dancing' footwork. Making the number 11 jersey his own, and scoring two further tries in the 2007 Six Nations, Hickie was first choice left wing for the 2007 World Cup, after which he retired."]}, {"page": "2006 Six Nations Championship", "response": ["* Ronan O'Gara becomes Ireland's all time top point scorer after converting Andrew Trimble's try."]}, {"page": "Shannon RFC", "response": ["*The origin of the term Pothole originates from the former Australia national rugby union teamplayer, John Langford (rugby union) , during one Shannon Rugby training session, he called one of his teammates a pothole.
