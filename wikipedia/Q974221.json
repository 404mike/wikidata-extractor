Through the songs on the album, he takes a close look at native traditions like Peyote Healing. The album's opening track, \"The Sound Is Fading\", samples a recording of a young Native American singer from the 1940s that Robertson got from the Library Of Congress, and the song \"Sacrifice\" includes parts of an interview from prison with Leonard Peltier set to a soundscape produced by Robertson and de Vries.

It was produced by Flood, Howie B, and Steve Osborne, and was released on 3 March 1997 on Island Records. The album was a continuation of the band's 1990s musical reinvention, as they incorporated alternative rock, techno, dance, and electronica influences into their sound. Pop employed a variety of production techniques that were relatively new to U2, including sampling, loops, programmed drum machines, and sequencing.", "Recording sessions began in 1995 with various record producers, including Nellee Hooper, Flood, Howie B, and Osborne, who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. was inactive due to a back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen's return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming 1997 PopMart Tour before the record was completed, they felt rushed into delivering it. Even after delaying the album's release date from the 1996 Christmas and holiday season to March 1997, U2 ran out of time in the studio, working up to the last minute to complete songs.", "In the first half of the 1990s, U2 underwent a dramatic shift in musical style. The band had experimented with alternative rock and electronic music and the use of samples on their 1991 album, Achtung Baby, and, to a greater extent, on 1993's Zooropa. In 1995, the group's side-projects provided them an opportunity to delve even deeper into these genres. Bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. recorded \"Theme from Mission: Impossible\" in an electronica style. The recording was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997 and was an international top-ten hit. In 1995, U2 and Brian Eno recorded an experimental album, Original Soundtracks 1, under the moniker \"Passengers\". The project included Howie B, Akiko Kobayashi and Luciano Pavarotti, among others.", "For the new record, U2 wanted to continue their sonic experimentation from Achtung Baby and Zooropa. To do so, they employed multiple producers to have additional people with whom to share their ideas. Flood was principal producer, having previously worked with the group as engineer for The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, and co-producer of Zooropa. Mark \"Spike\" Stent and Howie B were principal engineers. Flood described his job on Pop as a \"creative coordinator\", saying, \"There were some tracks where I didn't necessarily have a major involvement... but ultimately the buck stopped with me. I had the role of the creative supervisor who judged what worked and didn't work.\" Howie B had previously provided mixing, treatments, and scratching for Original Soundtracks 1. On Pop, he was initially given the role of \"DJ and Vibes\" before assuming responsibilities as co-producer, engineer, and mixer. One of his main tasks was to introduce the band to sounds and influences within electronica. The band and Howie B regularly went out to dance clubs to experience club music and culture. The overall goal for the record was to create a new sound for the band that was still recognisable as U2.", "U2 began work on Pop in mid-1995, collaborating with Nellee Hooper in London, France, and Ireland. In September, the band moved the recording sessions to Hanover Quay in Dublin to a studio the band had just converted from a warehouse.McCormick (2006), p. 265. The studio was designed to be more of a rehearsal space more than an actual studio. Flood, Howie B, Steve Osborne, and Marius de Vries joined Hooper and the band there, each of them incorporating their influences and experiences in electronic dance music. Flood described Howie's influence thus: \"Howie would be playing all kinds of records to inspire the band and for them to improvise to. That could be anything from a jazz trumpet solo to a super groove funk thing, with no holds barred. We also programmed drum loops, or took things from sample CDs; anything to get the ball rolling. U2 arrive in the studio with very little finished material.\" These sessions lasted until December 1995, and around 30\u201340 pieces of music emerged during this period.", "Following Mullen's return and the sessions' resumption in February 1996, the production team of Flood, Howie B, and Hooper spent three months attempting to re-work much of the band's material to better incorporate loops and samples with their musical ideas from 1995. This period was a difficult one; Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace loops that Howie B had sampled without permission. Flood said, \"We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, while incorporating a dance ethic... The groove-orientated way of making music can be a trap when there's no song; you end up just plowing along on one riff. So you have to try to get the groove and the song, and do it so that it sounds like the band, and do it so that it sounds like something new.\"", "Despite the initial difficulties with sampling, the band and production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, the Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost anything he could in order to find interesting sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge's guitar playing, which the guitarist, having never done it before, found very interesting. Howie B explained, \"Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a pneumatic drill, because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different.\" Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly out of fear of becoming overreliant on it.", "During the recording sessions, U2 allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming PopMart Tour before they had completed the album, putting the tour's start date at April 1997.McCormick (2006), p. 270. The album was originally planned to be completed and released in time for the 1996 Christmas and holiday season, but the band found themselves struggling to complete songs, necessitating a delay in the album's release date until March 1997. Even with the extended timeframe to complete the album, recording continued up to the last minute. Bono devised and recorded the chorus to \"Last Night on Earth\" on, coincidentally, the last night of the album's recording and mixing. When Howie B and the Edge took the album to New York City to be mastered, changes and additions to the songs were still being made. During the process, Howie B was adding effects to \"Discoth\u00e8que\", while the Edge was recording backing vocals for \"The Playboy Mansion\". Of the last minute changes, the Edge said, \"It's a sign of absolute madness.\" Flood says, \"We had three different mixes of 'Mofo', and during mastering in November '96 in New York, I edited a final version of 'Mofo' from these three mixes. So even during mastering, we were trying to push the song to another level. It was a long process of experimentation; the album didn't actually come together until the last few months.\"", "\"Miami\" has a trip rock style. It begins with a drum loop, with Mullen's hi-hats playing backwards through a very extreme equalization filter. Howie B explained, \"The main groove is actually just Larry's hi-hat, but it sounds like a mad engine running or something really crazy \u2013 about as far away from a hi-hat as you can imagine... the task in 'Miami' was to make it unlike anything else on the album, and also unlike anything else you'd ever have heard before.\" Edge also comes in with a frenetic guitar riff and Bono's affected vocal style singing about Miami in metaphors and descriptions of loud, brash Americana. D. Leurssen described it as a \"sonic travelogue,\" while the Edge termed it \"creative tourism.\"D. Luerssen (2010), 296 In 2005, Q magazine included the song \"Miami\" in a list of \"Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists\". However, Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine acknowledged the inclusion of the song in Q's list and said \"I\u2019m pretty sure they gave this album some super-glowing review when it was first released, so clearly they\u2019re not to be trusted in the first.\"", "Pop initially received favourable reviews from critics. Barney Hoskyns of Rolling Stone gave Pop a four-star rating, praising the band's use of technology on the album: \"U2 know that technology is ineluctably altering the sonic surface \u2013 and, perhaps, even the very meaning \u2013 of rock & roll.\" The review also stated that U2 had \"pieced together a record whose rhythms, textures and visceral guitar mayhem make for a thrilling roller-coaster ride\" and that the band had \"defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives\". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating, saying: \"Despite its glittery launch, the album is neither trashy nor kitschy, nor is it junky-fun dance music. It incorporates bits of the new technology \u2013 a high-pitched siren squeal here, a sound-collage splatter there \u2013 but it is still very much a U2 album\". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times rated Pop four-stars-out-of-four, judging the album to benefit \"from the tension of... competing influences, sometimes leaning more on the electronic currents, elsewhere showcasing the more melodic and accessible songwriting strengths\". He praised the group's musical experimentation, saying, \"It is such boldness that has enabled U2 to remain at the creative forefront of pop music for more than a decade.\" James Hunter of Spin rated the record 9/10, writing, \"Pop realizes a symphonic transcendence for which the band's earlier stabs like The Unforgettable Fire could only wish.\" He added, \"They are now experts at wringing genuine emotion, and even a few smirks, out of random sounds, letting their roots filter up from below.\" Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald praised the album's understated tracks and the influence of Howie B, and said that the band avoided making the same mistake as rock counterparts of \"trying to slap a traditional bottom-end on top of a metronomic beat and calling it dance\". He said that despite not being \"the future of rock'n'roll\", Pop was \"a genuine snapshot of its present by a band bright enough to keep exploring, smart enough not to abandon its past and big enough to make it palatable to radio programmers\" resistant to dance music.", "* Howie B\u00a0\u2013 production, turntables, keyboards, engineering, mixing", "Category:Albums produced by Howie B"]}, {"page": "Homogenic", "response": ["Homogenic is the third studio album by Icelandic recording artist Bj\u00f6rk.

Bj\u00f6rk went to M\u00e1laga and arranged to meet with flamenco guitarist Raimundo Amador. Bj\u00f6rk had originally intended to stay in M\u00e1laga only briefly, but later decided to record the entirety of Homogenic there. Bj\u00f6rk made a final trip out of the country before staying in Spain. As she had done since moving to London, Bj\u00f6rk returned to Iceland for Christmas. While there, she wrote more new songs for Homogenic, including \"J\u00f3ga\". Before returning to Spain to record, Bj\u00f6rk was sidetracked by a two-week worldwide press tour for the promotion of her remix album Telegram, which had just been released. After returning to the studio in Spain in late January, Bj\u00f6rk decided to end work with producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both Debut and Post, as she felt they had \"stopped surprising each other\". Bj\u00f6rk had intended to produce the album alone, but sought collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO's Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Bj\u00f6rk on Debut and Post and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on Post. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed to the production of Homogenic, but were unable due to their production on the album Wu-Tang Forever, which had taken longer than planned. Most of the melodies on the album were created by Bj\u00f6rk, who then composed string sections on a Casio keyboard and brought them to programmers who would add rhythmic patterns. Bj\u00f6rk had wanted to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post; Bell was credited for the majority of the album's production, including the songs \"Pluto\", \"Alarm Call\", and the bassline in \"J\u00f3ga\". Bj\u00f6rk stated that she \"trusts and respects what [Bell] does for me. If I were to say who has influenced me most it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell\".

Back in London, Bj\u00f6rk contacted \"old standby\" Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar \u00d6rn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on \"Enjoy\". Renowned English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Bj\u00f6rk's request. Bj\u00f6rk decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called \"Travessia\". Deodato's presence as composer and conductor \"immediately bolstered\" \"Hyperballad\", \"You've Been Flirting Again\" and \"Isobel\".
