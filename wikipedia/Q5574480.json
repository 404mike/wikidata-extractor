He finally settled on a steep slope of the Barranco de Guiniguada in the vicinity of Tafira Alta, featuring a waterfall and shallow caves in the cliff face.  Work on laying out the garden began in 1952, and the Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Canario Viera y Clavijo was officially opened in 1959.  Svensson served as its first director.

For BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4, he has made programmes on diverse subjects, including Ivor Cutler, clapping, time travel, and the murmurations of starlings. He is the founder and host of Brighton's spoken word night, the Catalyst Club. Bramwell is also a singer-songwriter with his band Oddfellow's Casino. Describing Bramwell's writing, Matthew Clayton declares that 'The tradition that he taps into is one best exemplified by the work of Ken Campbell \u2014 or from another perspective he is one part Eric Morecombe, one part Alan Moore.\u2019Mathew Clayton, 'The Cult of Water', Caught by the River, 20 October 2020 ", "Bramwell was born in Scunthorpe, moving to Doncaster at the age of six, where he lived until he was eighteen. After 'four long years studying geography'David Bramwell, The Haunted Moustache, Nightfinch Books, 2016, p.25 at Coventry Polytechnic, he moved to Brighton in the early 1990s. He describes the impact of Brighton in his book, The Haunted Moustache: 'For a northern boy in his early twenties and still wet behind the ears Brighton was overwhelming. I'd stumbled on an exotic seaside town that welcomed me with open arms....To top it off, Brighton was almost comically eccentric.' Much of Bramwell's work documents and celebrates the eccentricity of the seaside city, as he strives 'to keep the spirit of Brighton alive and through his work across a multitude of platforms.'", "thumb|left| David Bramwell introduces a talk on 'Occult Brighton' by Sir Ralph Harvey, Wiccan priest, at the Odditorium, 2 May 2015", "Bramwell is the founder of Cheeky Guides Ltd, writing and publishing guide books which celebrate 'everything unusual, entertaining and saucy that a town has to offer, from how to attend a s\u00e9ance, places to spot local celebrities, where to get egg and chips at four in the morning, and the best place to buy fetish underwear'. The most popular is the Cheeky Guide to Brighton, which has gone through six editions since its first appearance in 1999. A typical entry in the 'What's On' section claims that, on 28 December, Brightonians celebrate Poseidon's Day: 'Once a year, 23 Brighton councillors gather on the nudist beach to offer blessings and sacrifices to the venerable sea god. Hosted by Simon Fanshawe the dancing, nudity and orgies go on into the small hours, weather permitting.'David Bramwell, The Cheeky Guide to Brighton (2nd edition), 2001, p. 228", "In 2011, The Haunted Moustache was dramatised for Radio 3's Between the Ears. It won a Sony Silver Award for best feature, and was followed by further Bramwell programmes, all produced by Sara Jane Hall. She described the making of The Haunted Moustache on a BBC blog: \"When David Bramwell, presenter of The Haunted Moustache, first pulled out a box containing an unlikely inheritance \u2013 a small waxed moustache \u2013 I decided not to ask if it was real, or how much of his tale was true. Remarkably neither did anyone else.  It was a game between us \u2013 don't ask, don't tell \u2013  and the final programme was a riddle for the listener \u2013 soothed by David's haunting music.\"", "In 2009, Bramwell began to research the Cult of Water, based around a psychogeographical journey along the River Don. In an interview in 2019, he described how the project grew out of his own fear of water: 'I\u2019ve wrestled all my life with thalassophobia \u2013 the fear of large bodies of water \u2013 and wanted to confront this fear. In the last ten years I went down a rabbit hole researching water cults, sacred springs and wells. I wanted to pay my respect to water. I also became interested in the idea of following a river back to its source. I knew if I was going to make this journey as a pilgrimage it\u2019d have to be along the river Don where I grew up, to search for its lost water goddess and to trace its biological and metaphorical death and resurrection over the millennia.
