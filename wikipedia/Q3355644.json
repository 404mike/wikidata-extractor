He won silver medals in the individual road race and the team road race. In 1914, after he retired from racing, he established a bicycle manufacturing business (F.H.Grubb) in Brixton, London. By 1920 manufacturing had moved to Croydon and then in 1926 to Twickenham. In 1935 FHG Ltd was established in Wimbledon but by 1947 the F H Grubb name was back in use. Two years after his death the business was bought by Holdsworth, which used the Freddie Grubb brand until around 1978.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of bicycle brands and manufacturing companies", "response": ["* Freddie Grubb - UK"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Freddie Grubb"]}, {"page": "Roberts Cycles", "response": ["Beginning soon after World War II, Charles (Charlie) Benjamin Roberts was a frame-builder for Holdsworth, Claud Butler and Freddie Grubb.

His specialty was time trials and, according to the records of Addiscombe Cycling Club, founded by Charlie Davey in 1906, he held the Southern Road Racing Association 12 hour record from 1940 until 1959 as well as setting the South Eastern 12 hour record in 1946.

The road cycling disciplines had been in the Olympic program since inception of the modern Olympics in 1896.  The Individual Road Race has featured in every games with the Team Time Trial, Individual time Trial and Team Road Race appearing in certain Olympic programs.

Thus, in 2008, Cooke not only recorded the first British Olympic Gold Medal in any cycling discipline for a female and also the first ever Gold Medal won in any road discipline by a British rider, irrespective of sex.  On the previous day none of the four British men entered in the Individual Road Race finished the race.  This was also the first ever Olympic Gold Medal won by a Welsh woman in an individual Olympic event."]}, {"page": "FH Grubb", "response": ["#REDIRECT Freddie Grubb"]}]}}
