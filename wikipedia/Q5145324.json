Modern Fantasy: Five Studies (1975, published as by C. N. Manlove), which considers at length works by Charles Kingsley, George MacDonald, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and Mervyn Peake, was written at a time when \"no serious study of the subject [of fantasy literature] has appeared\". In it he posits a definition of fantasy as: \n\nA fiction evoking wonder and containing a substantial and irreducible element of supernatural or impossible worlds, beings or objects with which the mortal characters in the story or the readers become on at least partly familiar terms.\n\nHis conclusion, however, is negative: each of the five major writers whose work he considered failed to sustain their original vision.He was a lecturer in English Literature at the University of Edinburgh from 1967 until his retirement in 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Williams (British writer)", "response": ["All of Williams's fantasies, unlike those of J.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey applies Lord Acton's 1887 statement that \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men\" to it. He notes that the opinion is distinctively modern, and that other modern authors such as George Orwell with Animal Farm (1945), William Golding with Lord of the Flies (1954), and T. H. White with The Once and Future King (1958) similarly wrote about the corrupting effects of power. When the critic Colin Manlove described Tolkien's attitude to power as inconsistent, arguing that the supposedly overwhelming Ring was handed over easily enough by Sam and Bilbo, and had little effect on Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, Shippey replies in \"one word\" that the explanation is simple: the Ring is addictive, increasing in effect with exposure. Other scholars concur about its addictive nature."]}, {"page": "C. N. Manlove", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Manlove"]}, {"page": "C.N.

The Ring also appears to have little effect on characters such as Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Shippey notes that, despite Manlove, Tolkien is fair in showing a regular pattern of \"creeping corruption\": Bilbo becomes angry when Gandalf tries to coax him to give up the Ring, and is seen as \"a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands\" when he asks Frodo to let him look at the Ring just one more time; Isildur uses Gollum-like words with \"It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain\"; there is Gollum's corrupted state throughout the story; and there are the ominous signals from Boromir. Shippey replies to Manlove's doubt with \"one word\": addictive. He writes that this sums up Gandalf's whole argument, as in the early stages, as with Bilbo and Sam, the addiction can be shaken off easily enough, while for those who are not yet addicted, as with Aragorn and indeed others like Galadriel and Faramir, its pull is like any other temptation. What Gandalf could not do to Frodo, Shippey writes, is make him want to hand the Ring over. And for the owner of the Ring, the destructive aspect is the urge to use it, no matter how good the intentions of the owner might be at the start. Katz writes that \"it is clear that Tolkien is demonstrating to us the progressive forces of corruption of the possession and use of the One Ring\"; usage may begin innocently or accidentally, but \"its seductive power\" gradually wears down any resistance. "]}, {"page": "Literary hostility to J. R. R. Tolkien", "response": ["Alongside their analysis of Tolkien's work, scholars set about rebutting many of the literary critics' claims. For instance, starting with his 1982 book The Road to Middle-earth, Tom Shippey pointed out that Muir's assertion that Tolkien's writing was non-adult, as the protagonists end with no pain, is not true of Frodo, who is permanently scarred and can no longer enjoy life in the Shire. Or again, he replies to Colin Manlove's attack on Tolkien's \"overworked cadences\" and \"monotonous pitch\" and the suggestion that the Ubi sunt section of the Old English poem The Wanderer is \"real elegy\" unlike anything in Tolkien, with the observation that Tolkien's Lament of the Rohirrim is a paraphrase of just that section; other scholars have praised Tolkien's poem. As a final example, he replies to the critic Mark Roberts's 1956 statement that The Lord of the Rings \"is not moulded by some vision of things which is at the same time its raison d'etre\"; he calls this one of the least perceptive comments ever made on Tolkien, stating that on the contrary the work \"fits together ... on almost every level\", with complex interlacing, a consistent ambiguity about the Ring and the nature of evil, and a consistent theory of the role of \"chance\" or \"luck\", all of which he explains in detail."]}]}}
