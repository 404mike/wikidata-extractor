Green, Martial Arts of the World, ABC-CLIO, 2001, p.519 (1794\u20131869) and Charles Lecour (1808\u20131894). Casseux opened the first establishment in 1825 for practicing and promoting a regulated version of chausson and savate (disallowing head butting, eye gouging, grappling, etc.). However the sport had not shaken its reputation as a street-fighting technique. Casseux's pupil Charles Lecour was exposed to the English art of boxing when he witnessed an English boxing match in France between English pugilist Owen Swift and Jack Adams in 1838.Savate \u2013 Canne \u2013 Baton au fil des si\u00e8cle:  la v\u00e9rifiable histoire de la boxe fran\u00e7aise and Swift's own biography in The Handbook To Boxing by Renton Nicholson, London 1840.  Lecour also took part in a friendly sparring match with Swift later in that same year. Lecour felt that he was at a disadvantage, using his hands only to bat his opponent's fists away, rather than to punch. He then trained in boxing for a time before combining boxing with chausson and savate to create the sport of savate (or boxe fran\u00e7aise, as we know it today). At some point la canne and le baton, stick fighting, were added, and some form of stick fencing, such as la canne, is commonly part of savate training. Those who train purely for competition may omit this. Savate was developed professionally by Lecour's student Joseph Charlemont and then his son Charles Charlemont.  Charles continued his father's work and in 1899 fought an English boxer named Jerry Driscoll.  He won the match with a round-kick (fouett\u00e9 median) in the eighth round although the English said that it was a kick to the groin. According to the well known English referee, Bernard John Angle of the National Sporting Club, in his book My Sporting Memories (London, 1925), \"Driscoll did not know what he was taking on\" when he agreed \"to meet the Frenchman at his own game\". Angle also said that, \"The contest ended in Jerry being counted out to a blow in the groin from the Frenchman's knee.\" He further alleged that \"the timekeeper saved Charlemont several times\". After the fight Driscoll bore no grudges, considering the blow to have been \"an accident\". The French claimed victory for their man by stoppage, following a round-kick to Driscoll's stomach."]}, {"page": "London Prize Ring Rules", "response": ["Famous fighters of prize ring include William \"Bendigo\" Thompson, Tom Cribb, Jack Broughton, James \"Deaf\" Burke, \"Professor\" Mike Donovan, Tom Allen, Samuel \"Dutch Sam\" Elias, John \"Gentleman\" Jackson, the \"Benicia Boy\" John Camel Heenan, Daniel Mendoza, Tom Molineaux, John \"Old Smoke\" Morrisey, Tom Sayers, Owen Swift, the \"Trojan Giant\" Paddy Ryan, Joe Goss, and James \"Yankee Sullivan\" Ambrose, Arhan \"Hanuman Dragon\" Deshmukh.

They then went on a joint tour of the country, but only the relative success of the Irish and Scottish legs of this tour redeemed the failure of the English part. Heenan returned to the United States, setting out on 4 July 1860. He was forced to leave his championship belt behind as it was kept as security against a sum of money advanced to the jeweller who had made the belt. A large crowd of \"sporting men\" thronged the London station from which Heenan departed on his way to Southampton to catch the steamer to America.

Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as was the use of stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, at the end of which each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8\u00a0seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing."]}, {"page": "Young Dutch Sam", "response": ["On 24 June 1834, Sam was present in Andover at Hurstbourne Common before an impressive audience of nearly 10,000 in a particularly brutal fight of Owen Swift's lasting seventy-three rounds.  The bout tragically resulted in the death of Swift's opponent Anthony Noon.  Upon Noon's death, a warrant was issued for the apprehension of Young Dutch Sam on 26 June 1834.  Immediately prior to the fight between Noon and Swift on 24 June 1834, Young Dutch had defeated a boxer named Tom Gaynor in seventeen rounds in two hours and five minutes.\"The Prizefights Near Andover\", The Observer, London, England, pg 4. 29 June 1834   Young Dutch administered his strongest blows with his left hand, as according to London's Morning Chronicle, he had injured his right hand in the second round.

Phelps died three days later as a result of the injuries he sustained from the fight with Swift which occurred at Melbourne Heath in Cambridgeshire.  The battle was a brutal affair lasting 85 rounds and 95 minutes.    The event had a large audience of 3000, as it was easily accessible by coach, and Swift was well known.  Swift's prize fighting had led to the death of two former opponents, and William Phelps, himself, had previously killed a man in a prize fight.Description of Owen's fight with Phelp and subsequent death in \"The Late Fatal Prizefight\", The Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 4, 20 March 1838  These factors later incited several magistrates to act and three months later, in June of 1838, Curtis was sentenced to eight months imprisonment at Herford Assizes for acting as a principle to manslaughter in the second degree, even though he had only acted as second to the victim.  Curtis was discharged from custody, however, on 11 July 1838, when a coroner determined that the cause of death could not be exclusively attributed to the fight.  The death of William Phelps eventually led to the adoption of the London Prize Ring Rules which included certain safety measures, and excluded some of the harsher forms of fighting by making them fouls.   London Prize Ring Rules replaced the less restrictive Broughton's rules of 1743, under which Curtis fought.Discharged on 11 July 1838 in Downes, Henry, Puglistica, (1906), John Grant Miles Publishing, Edinburgh, Scotland, pg. 127", "The carriage of Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford was seen at the match between Swift and Phelps, and the Marquess was known at times to both drink and gamble to excess, a habit which had had negative consequences for Young Dutch Sam, Owen Swift's second at the fight.  It is not unlikely the Marquess and other nobleman were occasionally in the company of Curtis when he turned to drinking after his loss to Jack Perkins, and after his incarceration after the death of William Phelps. Such behavior contributed to Curtis's poor health and early death five years later.The Carriage of 3rd Marquis of Waterford was at the fight in \"The Late Fatal Prizefight\", The Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 4, 20 March 1838"]}, {"page": "Harry Lazarus", "response": ["Lazarus came to the US with his father and two brothers when Izzy Lazarus, Sr. fought Owen Swift in 1850.

Due to Savate's roots in street fighting, Savateurs even held their guard low. In order to establish Savate as a fair sport Michel Casseux had dropped a number of fighting techniques that henceforth had been considered unsporting. Subsequently, fighting a boxer at very close range (infight), especially someone who had cause the deaths of two English boxers was difficult for him  because the use of elbows or knees was no part of the sport version of Savate. Charles Lecour would mainly have to score with techniques that in English boxing should have led to his disqualification, and the fight result fueled Lecour to learn English boxing too."]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* Owen Swift (1814\u20131879)"]}]}}
