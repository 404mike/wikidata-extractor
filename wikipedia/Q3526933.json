His first real action in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just a quarter of an hour before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes\u2014but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and effectively brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). This amazing effort finally came to an end when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A short delay revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from the pain in his bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion\u2014bowled), he faced just nine deliveries."]}, {"page": "John Hodges", "response": ["Hodges took three wickets in his first Test, including John Selby twice, and did enough to earn selection for the second Test two weeks later.  He claimed another three wickets in the second Test and this time it was Andrew Greenwood that fell to him in both innings.  In the two Tests he scored just ten runs (with two ducks and a highest score of 8) and his fielding was considered casual bordering on slipshod."]}, {"page": "Wilfred Flowers", "response": ["born 7 December 1856 in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, England, Flowers was a slow bowler, who bowled offbreaks and a strong batsman who was one of the leading all-rounders of his day. He first played for Nottinghamshire in 1877, and established himself slowly in a very strong side despite being known to be unplayable on a sticky wicket. In 1881, however, a players\u2019 strike devastated NottinghamshireNottinghamshire strike and Flowers, seen as a player with less resolve than Alfred Shaw, Fred Morley, Arthur Shrewsbury, and John Selby, was approached by county officials and took advantage of the opportunity to become much more important in the redevelopment of the county. Flowers took such advantage of this that in 1882 he took one hundred wickets for the first time. His batting, which had been not outstanding but valuable in an era of very low scoring, developed greatly the following year, in which Flowers became the first professional to do the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Derbyshire, Flowers had the outstanding record of an innings of 131 and eleven wickets for eighty-seven runs."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["John Selby \u00b7"]}, {"page": "1878 English cricket season", "response": ["|John Selby || Nottinghamshire|| 21 || 31 || 1 || 938 || 107 || 31.26 || 1 || 8"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876\u201377", "response": ["* John Selby (wk)"]}, {"page": "William Mycroft", "response": ["Mycroft's form was to last into the 1876 season, when he was top bowler with 62 wickets and achieved best bowling of 9\u201325, a record which lasted nearly fifty years before being bettered by Billy Bestwick. He played several matches for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), and also appeared for Players and the North. At this time he found himself in an assembled team of cricketers in several Gentlemen vs. Players matches, Mycroft's fellow Players including past and future England Test representatives Arthur Shrewsbury, George Ulyett, John Selby, Tom Emmett, and Fred Morley. In the 1877 season, Mycroft took most wickets for Derbyshire with 63 and took five wickets in an innings eight times, but did even more deadly work for the MCC with 31 wickets at the extraordinary average of 7.29, and also was deadly in one innings for England against KentKent v England (Scorecard) and a powerful Gloucestershire team with W.G. Grace in his prime.England v Gloucestershire (Scorecard) In 1878, Mycroft played much less outside county cricket, taking only fifteen wickets, but took a career best 101 for Derbyshire.

Grace scored 90, his highest score of the season so far, and was well supported by Alfred and Edward Lyttelton.

The other was George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 was not a good season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two."]}, {"page": "W. G.

He topped the batting averages ahead of John Selby, E.M. Grace, Richard Daft, William Yardley and A.N. Hornby.  His nearest challengers among runscorers were Richard Humphrey, Jupp and Lockwood.  Grace's 62 wickets placed him 5th in that list, once again well behind the leader Southerton who took 169.

In 1880, the Australians toured England, making considerable money from gate receipts, something English cricketers, regarded as \"gentlemen\" did not do. Nottinghamshire's Alfred Shaw, however, saw this as an opportunity. He arranged a first-class match between the Players of the North and the Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford toward the end of the tour, which made Shrewsbury a healthy profit. A few days after this match, he hastily arranged a match between Nottinghamshire and the Australians at Trent Bridge. Seeking once more to make money, Shaw informed Holden that himself and six other Nottinghamshire players would only take to the field for a minimum of \u00a320 each. Holden agreed, albeit reluctantly, and was reported to privately fuming at the demand. In the Autumn, Shaw attempted to arrange an early season fixture for the following season against Yorkshire, with the view of once again profiting from it. Holden found out about this and told Shaw he alone did not have the authority to arrange county fixtures. He proceeded to write to all of Nottinghamshire's professionals, informing them they would have to sign a binding contract under which they would have to be available for all official Nottinghamshire matches. Shaw, Arthur Shrewsbury, William Barnes, Wilfred Flowers, Fred Morley, William Scotton and John Selby disagreed with his proposal."]}, {"page": "John Selby", "response": ["John Selby may refer to:", "*John Selby (cricketer) (1849\u20131894), English cricketer", "*John Selby (MP), Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed", "*John Selby (died 1595), English official on the Scottish border", "*John Selby (psychologist) (born 1945), American psychologist and author"]}, {"page": "John Burrows (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Selby (cricketer) (1849\u20131894), born John Burrows, English cricket player"]}]}}
