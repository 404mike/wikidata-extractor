He also played for the Yorkshire Second XI (1903), Northallerton and District (1903) and Yorkshire Cricket Council (1903-1912).\nBorn in Heckmondwike, Yorkshire, England, Ward was a slow left arm orthodox spin bowler, who bowled twelve overs for 16 runs without taking a wicket. He scored a duck in his only first-class innings.  There was no play on the first two days of the match, and the game was moved from the main ground at Lord's to the nursery ground on the third day, to allow a day's play to take place. The match ended in a draw.\nWard died in February 1948 in Dewsbury, Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick Ward", "response": ["Frederick Ward may refer to:", "*Frederick Ward (football manager) (1825\u20131908), Master Cutler and first chairman of Sheffield F.C.", "*Frederick Ward (Australian politician) (1873\u20131954), Australian senator", "*Frederick Ward (cricketer) (1881\u20131948), English cricketer, played one first class game for Yorkshire", "*Frederick Ward (theatre) (born 1887), Australian actor and theatre businessman", "*Yaffer Ward (Frederick Ward, 1895\u20131953), English footballer", "*Frederick Warde (1851\u20131935), Shakespearean actor", "*Frederick Ward Merriman, New Zealand politician"]}]}}
