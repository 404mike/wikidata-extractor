His father has backed Ernest Peabody (Cecil) for mayor. Ernest has betrayed Violet Gaynor (Johnson), Jim's secretary. Beatrice Forbes (Adams), whom Billy likes and would like Billy if she only knew it, has fallen for Ernest's grandiloquent line of bunk and promised to marry him. Violet has learned that Earnest has double-crossed Jim in politics about the time her father Jerry Gaynor (Robbins) has discovered her condition (pregnancy) and, believing Billy guilty of being the father, attempts to blackmail him and \"queers\" his relationship with Beatrice. Mitt Deagon (O'Brien), who loves Violet, also discovers her secret and attempts to expose Ernest, but is prevented by Billy, who is completely unaware of the facts. While campaigning, Ernest's car strikes Violet's father and, believing the man is dead, Ernest flees in a cowardly fashion. The election of Ernest Peabody seems certain and he announces his engagement to Beatrice. When Violet reads this, she does what any woman betrayed in love would do, and in a climax of fast events clears up the triangle. When Billy understands the character of Ernest, he decides to see to it that Ernest is neither elected mayor nor married to Beatrice.", "* Tom McGuire as Jim Winthrop "]}, {"page": "Colleen (1927 film)", "response": ["*Tom McGuire as Police Lieutenant"]}, {"page": "The Self-Made Wife", "response": ["* Tom McGuire as Hotchkiss"]}, {"page": "The Five Dollar Baby", "response": ["* Tom McGuire as Mr. Donovan "]}, {"page": "The Little Giant (1926 film)", "response": ["* Tom McGuire as Mr. Dansey "]}, {"page": "The Married Flapper", "response": ["*Tom McGuire as John Holbrook"]}, {"page": "Afraid to Fight", "response": ["Afraid to Fight is a 1922 silent American drama film directed by William Worthington and written by Charles Sarver.
