After initially protesting his innocence, he later admitted taking a banned steroid but insisted he had done so inadvertently.He returned to the sport in 1997 after serving a four-year ban. In 1999, he set a personal best time of 21.39 seconds over 200 metres (indoors).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doping at the Olympic Games", "response": ["|Jason Livingston"]}, {"page": "1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|Jason Livingston|| 10.25"]}, {"page": "Livingston (surname)", "response": ["* Jason Livingston (born 1971), British sprint athlete"]}, {"page": "Crawley Raiders", "response": ["Notable players and coaches in the history of the club included Fitzroy Miller (RB), Martin Turner (OL), Gus Romain (RB), Steve Henry (RB), ex-GB Sprinter Jason Livingston (RB), Malcolm Bamsey (WR), Andy Hall (WR and K), Paul Allison (QB), Barry Spencer (QB), John Lloyd (LB), Ron Robinson (DL), Phil Rickards (DE), Ian Ellis (S) and Jerry Mannagh (HC)."]}, {"page": "List of doping cases in athletics", "response": ["|Jason Livingston"]}, {"page": "1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's 60 metres", "response": ["| 12 || 2 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.60 || q", "| 7 || 2 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.54 || Q, SB", "| 7 || 7 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.63 ||"]}, {"page": "1989 European Athletics Junior Championships", "response": ["|Steve GookeyJohn KennyWayne GriffithJason Livingston || 40.11"]}, {"page": "1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's 60 metres", "response": ["| 22 || 1 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.70 ||"]}, {"page": "1992 European Athletics U23 Cup", "response": ["*: The 100 m event was initially won by Jason Livingston from the United Kingdom (10.72s), but he was disqualified for infringement of IAAF doping rules.", "*: The 4 \u00d7 100 m relay event was initially won by the United Kingdom (39.11s), but the team was disqualified for infringement of IAAF doping rules by team member Jason Livingston."]}, {"page": "1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 100 metres", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver|| Jason Livingston  ", "|  || align=left | Jason Livingston || align=left |  || 10.25 || ", "| 2 || align=left | Jason Livingston || align=left |  || 10.35 || Q", "| 2 || align=left | Jason Livingston || align=left |  || 10.38 || Q", "| 1 || align=left | Jason Livingston || align=left |  || 10.55 || Q"]}, {"page": "1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay", "response": ["| 4  || align=left |  || align=left| Jason LivingstonMark SmithMichael WilliamsJason John || 39.78 || ", "| 2  || align=left |  || align=left| Jason LivingstonMark SmithMichael WilliamsJason John || 39.88 || Q"]}, {"page": "1992 European Athletics Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's 60 metres", "response": ["|Jason Livingston", "| 10 || 4 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.72 || Q", "| 2 || 1 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.59 || Q", "|  || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.53 ||"]}, {"page": "1990 European Athletics Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's 60 metres", "response": ["| 13 || 3 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.77 || Q", "| 9 || 3 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.72 || Q", "| 6 || 6 || align=\"left\" | Jason Livingston ||align=left|  || 6.75 ||"]}, {"page": "1990 UK Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Jason Livingston || 10.31 "]}, {"page": "1992 UK Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Jason Livingston || 10.50"]}, {"page": "1997 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Jason Livingston || 10.38"]}, {"page": "1992 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Jason Livingston || 10.30"]}]}}
