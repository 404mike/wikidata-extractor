Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, which was previously featured as Castle Anthrax in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, was also used for exterior scenes. Saintfield Estates stood in as Winterfell's godswood, an enclosed wooded area where characters can worship the old gods beside trees with faces carved in their bark. A car park stood in for Winterfell's courtyard, and a wine cellar was used to depict the Stark family crypt. Tollymore Forest featured prominently in the prologue of the pilot episode and in the pivotal scene where the Starks first find the direwolves. Cairncastle, meanwhile, served as the location where Ned Stark beheads the deserter Will. The interior of Winterfell, such as the Tower of the First Keep, the Great Hall, and Catelyn's bedchamber, were filmed at The Paint Hall studio. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"Winterfell was based on a Scottish castle.\"", "For the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted a better option. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.\" The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: \"In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.\"", "The Red Keep interior are filmed at Belfast's studio The Paint Hall. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"When I was thinking about King's Landing, the whole red aspect of it, that immediately made me think of Rajasthan. The floor [at King's Landing] was from the Pantheon in Rome.\" Martin said that \"Our throne room is a spectacular throne room \u2013 we actually redressed a throne room built for [another] film. And again, it occupied a quarter of the Paint Hall, so it's very big, but in my mind [in the books], it's Westminster Abbey, it's St. Paul's Cathedral.\""]}, {"page": "Brad Renfro", "response": ["During Renfro's early career, his worldliness and self-confidence caused many adults who came into contact with him to believe that he was some years older than his actual age. Gemma Jackson, production designer on Tom and Huck, remembered Renfro as being 15 or 16 years of age during filming when he was actually 13. Jackson recounted to BuzzFeed that during production, Renfro had a girlfriend who was several years his senior. Renfro developed an ardent following among adolescent girls; Peter Horton, director of The Cure, recalled that the actor\u2014who had just turned 12\u2014received cards from local girls that contained sexually suggestive messages."]}, {"page": "Finding Neverland (film)", "response": ["| Art Direction: Gemma Jackson; Set Decoration: Trisha Edwards", "| Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "77th Academy Awards", "response": ["** Finding Neverland\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Gemma Jackson; Set Decoration: Trisha Edwards"]}, {"page": "Gemma (given name)", "response": ["* Gemma Jackson (born 1951), British production designer"]}, {"page": "58th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Finding Neverland \u2013 Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "Art Directors Guild Awards 2004", "response": ["**Gemma Jackson \u2013 Finding Neverland"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| Finding Neverland || Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "John Adams (miniseries)", "response": ["| Gemma Jackson, David Crank, Christina Moore, Kathy Lucas and Sarah Whittle"]}, {"page": "Jackson (name)", "response": ["*Gemma Jackson (born 1951), British art director"]}, {"page": "ADG Excellence in Production Design Awards", "response": ["* 2012: Game of Thrones (for \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\") by production designer Gemma Jackson", "* 2013: Game of Thrones (for \"Valar Dohaeris\") by production designer Gemma Jackson", "*2008: John Adams by production designer Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "Art Directors Guild Awards 2008", "response": ["*Gemma Jackson \u2013 John Adams"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["| Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "AACTA Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| style=\"background:#ffff80;\"|Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "Art Directors Guild Award for Excellence in Production Design for a Fantasy Film", "response": ["| Finding Neverland \u2021 || Gemma Jackson", "| Aladdin ||  Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "Art Directors Guild Award for Excellence in Production Design for a Period Film", "response": ["| Finding Neverland \u2021 || Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "Motley Theatre Design Course", "response": ["* Gemma Jackson Academy Award & BAFTA nominated production designer Finding Neverland, John Adams, Bridget Jones' Diary, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Iris, The Borrowers"]}, {"page": "A Golden Crown", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "GameCity Prize", "response": ["*Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "Game of Thrones (season 2)", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| Gemma Jackson, Frank Walsh, and Tina Jones for \"Garden of Bones\", \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\" and \"A Man Without Honor\"", "|scope=\"row\"| Gemma Jackson for \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\""]}, {"page": "The Ghost of Harrenhal", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| Gemma Jackson, Frank Walsh, and Tina Jones", "|scope=\"row\"| Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "List of awards and nominations received by Game of Thrones", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Jackson, Gemma\"| Gemma Jackson (for \"A Golden Crown\")", "| data-sort-value=\"Jackson, Gemma\"| Gemma Jackson (for \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\")", "| data-sort-value=\"Jackson, Gemma\"| Gemma Jackson (for \"Valar Dohaeris\")", "| data-sort-value=\"Jackson, Gemma\"| Gemma Jackson, Frank Walsh, and Tina Jones (for \"Garden of Bones\", \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\", and \"A Man Without Honor\")", "| data-sort-value=\"Jackson, Gemma\"| Gemma Jackson, Frank Walsh, and Tina Jones (for \"Valar Dohaeris\")"]}, {"page": "Valar Dohaeris", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| Gemma Jackson, Frank Walsh, and Tina Jones", "|scope=\"row\"| Gemma Jackson"]}, {"page": "Trisha Edwards", "response": ["Trisha Edwards is an Academy Award-nominated set decorator.
