By 1970 the organisation was floundering, and no student or avant-garde artist would have been interested in showing with them. When Patric Stevenson took the President's role in 1970 he personally oversaw the stabilisation of its finances and preservation of its records. Standards began to improve after T P Flanagan took the reins in 1978 as he held considerable influence over his students at the Belfast College of Art, in encouraging participation from younger and more adventurous artists. Others such as Raymond Piper, Neil Shawcross, and later Joe McWilliams and Bob Sloan did similarly. During David Evan's Presidency from 1983 to 1993 the Academy's Annual show was held at Queen's University, Belfast before returning to the Ulster Museum under Rowel Friers.Carruthers, M., and Douds, S., (2001), p.109"]}, {"page": "Mercy Hunter", "response": ["Hunter received an honorary Masters degree from Queen's University Belfast in 1975 at the same time as her long-term collaborator Patricia Mulholland.

She maintained a lifelong friendship with Blackshaw. Boyd dated Blackshaw in the early 1950s and painted her portrait in 1958. She studied under Romeo Toogood between 1950 and 1953. Boyd was presented a prize for the best painting and drawing student of 1951 at the opening of the Ulster Arts Club's annual winter exhibition. In 1954 Boyd was the first female recipient of a Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts travel scholarship worth \u00a375, which she used to study in Italy and France. Boyd was particularly interested in studying Florentine sculptors and their modern counterparts. A Roman Scene was later one of 145 works selected from a thousand submissions for an exhibition at Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery in 1957. Boyd exhibited with eight recent graduates at the YMCA Hall in Belfast in 1954. Exhibitors included Raymond Piper, TP Flanagan, Basil Blackshaw and Markey Robinson.

John Hewitt estimated that around one-hundred writers made contributions over the lifetime of the magazine, including many from throughout the United Kingdom, such as Kingsley Amis and R S Thomas. The editorial team's greatest success was with the first publication of William Butler Yeat's Civil War poem, Reprisals, facilitated by the Yeat's family friend and scholar, Oliver Edwards.
