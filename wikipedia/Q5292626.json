He played at representative level for Great Britain, England and Yorkshire, and at club level for Featherstone Rovers (Heritage \u2116 348) (captain) and Wakefield Trinity (Heritage \u2116 710), as a right-footed goal-kicking scrum-half, prop or loose forward, i.e. number 7, 8 or 10, or 13, during the era of contested scrums, and coached at club level for Batley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eddie Waring", "response": ["In the badly rain-affected 1968 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley, Waring described Wakefield Trinity player Don Fox with the line \"He's a poor lad!\" after Fox missed a last minute kick from in front of the posts against Leeds.

The Holy Grail would be achieved in the 1966\u201367 season when the experienced Harold Poynton led a powerful side, which included Neil Fox, Don Fox, Gary Cooper and Ray Owen, to victory over St. Helens in a replay of the championship final. They repeated the title feat the following year against Hull Kingston Rovers but were again denied the double when Leeds defeated them in the 1968 'water splash' final at Wembley, a match played during a downpour that saturated the pitch.
