In the 2000s, it obtained a small number of local councillors.

As time goes by this appears to be becoming a little more urgent. \"The latest crop\" is becoming more powerful both directly (a directly-elected mayor has more power over their area, be it a city, borough or whatever, than does an MP) and indirectly in terms of influencing or reflecting voting patterns (see Peter Davies, for example). Mtiedemann's first category is problematic; what does \"some leadership role\" mean? but it appears to me that WP does need to draw a distinction between modern-day directly-elected mayors with executive powers and purely ceremonial mayors (many of whom seem to serve as Mayor as a result of Buggins's turn).
