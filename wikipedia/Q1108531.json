Campbell (born July 24, 1931) is a retired British petroleum geologist who predicted that oil production would peak by 2007. He claims the consequences of this are uncertain but drastic, due to the world's dependency on fossil fuels for the vast majority of its energy. His theories have received wide attention but are disputed and have not significantly changed governmental energy policies at this time. To deal with declining global oil production, he has proposed the Rimini protocol.\nInfluential papers by Campbell include The Coming Oil Crisis, written with Jean Laherr\u00e8re in 1998 and credited with convincing the International Energy Agency of the coming peak; and The End of Cheap Oil, published the same year in Scientific American.\nThe Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, founded by Campbell in 2000, has been gaining recognition in the recent years. The association has organised yearly international conferences since 2002. The most recent conference of the USA chapter (ASPO-USA) was at the University of Texas in Austin, TX on 30 November and 1 December 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of geologists", "response": ["* Colin Campbell (born 1931), British petroleum geologist and Peak Oil theorist"]}, {"page": "Energy crisis", "response": ["* The Coming Oil Crisis by Colin Campbell"]}, {"page": "Energy development", "response": ["Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest.
