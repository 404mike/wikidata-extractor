He was also an amateur photographer.\nAfter experience in China, Gower worked in the British legation at T\u014dzen-ji, Edo (later Tokyo), as part of the staff of Rutherford Alcock. In 1863 he was involved in the bombardment of Kagoshima. In 1866 he became consul in Hakodate (in Ezo, later Hokkaid\u014d); he had previously been consul in Nagasaki (in Ky\u016bsh\u016b).For many years it was believed that either Gower or Walter B. Woodbury was commissioned by the London firm Negretti and Zambra to photograph China and Japan between 1857 and 1860. It is now known that Pierre Rossier was the photographer in question. The Leiden University photograph collection includes a portrait of Gower, signed \"P. Rossier\", and in 1859 Rossier and Gower shared passage on HMS Sampson from Nagasaki to Edo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Japan\u2013United Kingdom relations", "response": ["*Abel Gower - Consul"]}, {"page": "British Japan Consular Service", "response": ["*Abel Gower"]}, {"page": "Pierre Rossier", "response": ["Thanks to a number of documents of the time, it is now certain that Negretti and Zambra's photographs of China and Japan were taken by Rossier, but for many years it was thought that they might have been taken by either Walter B.

Once the investigation determined that she was a servant of the Englishman Mr. Walters, who lived within the settlement, she was released. However, Walters was angry over the affair, and on the next day, July 3, he trapped two police officers he believed to have been involved in her arrest within his estate. The case fell under consular jurisdiction and was judged by the English consul Abel Gower, who judged that the Japanese officers were unable to exercise police power in the settlement\u2014not even to patrol it, let alone arrest anyone. Thus, Walters was not found guilty of obstruction of justice against the officers, but only of false imprisonment. This judgment clarified that only the settlement police, under the authority of the executive committee, was allowed to undertake police action in the settlement. Hy\u014dgo Prefecture remained unable to exercise these powers in the settlement until its return in 1899.K\u014dbe Gaikokujin Kyory\u016bchi Kenky\u016bkai 2005, pp. 65\u201367K\u014dbe Gaikokujin Kyory\u016bchi Kenky\u016bkai 1999, pp. 42\u201343"]}]}}
