Much of the UK/Australia plot was directed by Nicholas Ferguson, with all of the interior scenes shot in the Granada studio in Manchester. Cicely Mill in the village of Rostherne, Cheshire, was used as the Thompson/Bannerman house. The stables where Amanda and subsequently Rebecca ran their business were in the nearby Tatton Park estate (the stables have since been converted into a coffee shop/restaurant). The Thompsons' garage was Ashley Smithy Garage in Ashley and The Railway Pub can be found in Heatley. Fiona Lewis and Simon Bannerman got married in St Oswald's church, Lower Peover (which also featured in Revelations) and the aborted first wedding of Amanda Thompson and Neil Brooks was in St Mary's church, Nether Alderley."]}, {"page": "Marc (TV series)", "response": ["Produced by Muriel Young and directed by Nicholas Ferguson, it ran for six weekly episodes in the autumn of 1977, before its host died in a car crash on 16 September that year. A pop music show with a very limited budget and markedly low production values, it gave Bolan a chance to showcase punk bands such as Generation X, the Jam, Radio Stars and Eddie and the Hot Rods. T. Rex lip synced at least three songs each week, with Bolan's guitar never appearing to be plugged in, a mixture of new versions of their old hits, and fresh tracks, while the guests were slotted in between. Not all were as notable as those listed above, though they also included Roger Taylor, drummer with the rock band Queen, in a rare solo TV appearance. They were also joined by a dance troupe called 'Heart Throb', images of whom standing next to Bolan, on Shutterstock, dated the 10th of August, 1977, identify them as Isobelle Skullnice; June Griffiths; Alison Basham; and Kirsty Hayes. Bolan introduced their 'Ain't it Strange', single, on Show 6; (by which time \"Pam, Michael, and David\" appear on the credits). Bolan referred to them in Show 6 as \"My\" (his) dancers\"."]}, {"page": "So It Goes (TV series)", "response": ["*Studio Director: Nicholas Ferguson"]}, {"page": "Nicolas Ferguson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas Ferguson"]}, {"page": "Ferguson, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Ferguson"]}]}}
