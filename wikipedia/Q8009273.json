His father was Joseph Fowler, a builder at \"The Chains\" in West Street.\nFowler became an architect and builder at Winterton, and about 1796 made drawings of Roman pavements discovered there. He took them to London to be engraved by his brother-in-law, Mr Hill. There he studied the process of copper-plate engraving, and in April 1799 brought out his own coloured engraving of a Roman pavement at Roxby. Between 1799 and 1829 he published three volumes of coloured engravings of twenty-five pavements, thirty-nine subjects from painted glass, five brasses and incised slabs, four fonts and eight miscellaneous subjects. He also created at least twenty-nine unpublished engravings, mostly of objects of antiquity. Many of the published plates were accompanied by printed broadsides.\nHe became acquainted with Sir Walter Scott and other celebrities, and was presented on at least one occasion to the royal family at Windsor. Some of his work can be seen in North Lincolnshire Museum in Scunthorpe and Baysgarth House Museum in Barton-on-Humber.\nSir Joseph Banks said of him: \"Others have shown us what they thought these remains ought to have been, but Fowler has shown us what they are, and that is what we want.\" According to the Dictionary of National Biography his works are distinguished by a strict fidelity especially remarkable at the time. Whenever it was possible he worked from tracings, rubbings, etc. It is claimed that he was the first to introduce the lead-lines in representations of painted glass. There is a characteristic portrait of him by W. Bond, from a painting by George Francis Joseph, A.R.A., dated 4 June 1810.\nFowler, though a member of the Church of England, was also a \u2018class-leader\u2019 among the Methodists.\nHe died 22 September 1832, and was buried at Winterton under a cruciform slab.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Fowler", "response": ["William Fowler may refer to:", "*William Fowler (MP for  Cambridge) (1828\u20131905), English MP and barrister", "*William Fowler (MP for Wycombe), English justice of the peace and member of parliament for Wycombe, 1431", "*William Fowler (Brothertown Indian) (1815\u20131862), first non-white Wisconsin legislator; killed in the U.S. Civil War", "*William Fowler (New Hampshire politician), member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives", "*William Fowler (artist) (1761\u20131832), English artist", "*William Fowler (architect) (1824\u20131906), Scottish architect", "*William Fowler (makar) (c. 1560\u20131612), Scottish writer", "*William Fowler (Mormon) (1830\u20131865), Latter-day Saints hymn writer", "*William Fowler, a fictional character in the animated series Transformers: Prime", "*William Fowler Mountford Copeland II, horticulturalist"]}, {"page": "1832 in architecture", "response": ["* September 22 \u2013 William Fowler, English architect and engraver (born 1761)"]}, {"page": "1832 in art", "response": ["**William Fowler, English artist (born 1761)"]}, {"page": "Winterton, Lincolnshire", "response": ["* William Fowler \u2013 (1761\u20131832); artist, architect and builder"]}, {"page": "1761 in art", "response": ["** William Fowler, English artist (died 1832)"]}, {"page": "Cleatham Hall, Lincolnshire", "response": ["The hall is sited in a  estate, with a walled-garden to the north, and outbuildings including an 1802 coach-house designed by William Fowler.
