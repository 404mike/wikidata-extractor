Struan Stevenson and other analysts have stated that MEK targets included only the Islamic Republic's governmental and security institutions.

Certain sources have cited the MEK's collaboration with Saddam Hussain as diminishing the MEK's standing inside Iran. Ronen Cohen agrees that MEK's popularity decreased because it sided with Iraq, but adds that this is hard to prove \"because of the nature of the government in Iran\". Other analysts cite the group being \"unpopular among Iranians\" for \"attacks on Iranian soldiers and civilians\".

Even though the MEK still asserts that it has significant support, Ervand Abrahamian says the MEK's popularity \"plummeted after becoming more violent in the early 1980s\".
