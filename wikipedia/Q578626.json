He learnt his trade at Hartlepool Golf Club, where he still holds the course record of 62. He won The Amateur Championship in 1999 and represented Great Britain & Ireland in the Walker Cup, before turning professional in 2000.\nStorm initially had difficulty establishing himself on the European Tour, and took a job in a local cake factory in the off season to help finance his early years as a professional. In 2004 he recorded two wins on the second tier Challenge Tour on his way to fourth in the end of season rankings, and automatic graduation back to the European Tour for 2005. That season he made a major advance by finishing 31st on the European Tour Order of Merit, an improvement of 90 places on his previous best.\nIn 2007, Storm won his first European Tour event, with a single shot victory at the Open de France ALSTOM. He commented, \"It's unbelievable, to be honest. It's an amazing feeling.... Over the last six or seven months I've been thinking that it might never happen. I've been putting too much pressure on myself but hopefully now I can go on to better things.\" He went on to finish the 2007 season ranked 16th on the Order of Merit.\nAt the 2007 PGA Championship, Storm led after the first round after shooting a 5-under par 65 at Southern Hills Country Club. However he could not maintain that form and finished in a tie for 62nd.In June 2009, Storm secured a place in the 2009 Open after two rounds of final qualifying at Sunningdale, he shot a record eight-under 62 on the new course in the morning and ended 10-under.In 2016, Storm finished 112th in the European Tour standings, one spot and 100 Euros short of regaining his Tour card. Storm regained his Tour card for the twelfth consecutive year after Patrick Reed lost his European Tour privileges for failing to make enough starts at regular (non-majors or WGC) events. It was the second consecutive year a golfer took advantage of another losing his privileges in such a manner, after Ben Evans was awarded a European Tour card for 2016 after Brooks Koepka lost his membership.\n84 days after almost losing his card, Storm won the South African Open, beating World Number 2, Rory McIlroy, in a playoff for his 2nd European Tour victory\nStorm also works with Today's Golfer magazine, writing tips and reviews.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1999 in sports", "response": ["Amateur \u2013 Graeme Storm"]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Cricket umpire Michael Gough is also a fan of the club and in January 2021 was appointed Honorary President of the Hartlepool United Supporters' Trust  Hartlepool born golfer Graeme Storm is a fan of Pools and it has been reported that the actor Christopher Timothy is also a fan but as Timothy is from Wales it is unclear what his connection to the town is."]}, {"page": "The Amateur Championship", "response": ["|1999||Royal County Down Golf Club||Graeme Storm||||align=\"center\"|7 & 6|| Aran Wainwright"]}, {"page": "South African Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2017 || AFR, EUR ||  Graeme Storm || align=\"center\" |270 || align=center|\u221218 || Playoff ||  Rory McIlroy|| Glendower || "]}, {"page": "Thongchai Jaidee", "response": ["In September 2015, Jaidee won his seventh European Tour title at the Porsche European Open in Germany by a single stroke over Englishman Graeme Storm.
