The initial distinction was made in the research article \u201cPost-Partum Necrosis of the Anterior Pituitary\u201d. In his research, Dr. Sheehan reviewed (through autopsy) the effects of pituitary necrosis on 12 cases of patient\u2019s that experienced postpartum necrosis. He observed cases where lesions and death occurred during or after pregnancy, as well as cases where death occurred in the late stage of necrosis (years later). This started the initial distinction of Sheehan\u2019s syndrome from Simmonds\u2019 disease (also known as hypopituitarism). Dr. Sheehan noted that significant features of these patient cases was hemorrhaging, which in his experience was most commonly caused by either: placenta Previa (low placenta), uterine rupture, cervical or uterine tears, post-partum atony, or retained placenta. Simmonds' disease, however, occurs in either sex due to causes unrelated to pregnancy."]}, {"page": "Sheehan", "response": ["*Harold Leeming Sheehan (1900\u20131988), British endocrinologist, for whom Sheehan's syndrome was named circa 1937"]}]}}
