The budget was \u00a375,000 and much of the funding was borrowed from the Ministry of Transport and local authorities.

Following council boundary changes, the main debenture holders were the Department of Transport (some 42%), Carnarvonshire County Council (later Gwynedd CC) 17.7%, Merioneth District Council 3.5%, Dwyfor District Council 13%, McAlpines 11.8%, Branch Nominees Ltd 11.7% with 0.1% thought untraceable through a Mrs Conbran/Sir John Stewart.", "In order to begin the restoration of the line, the WHR Society (or any other organisation so interested) needed to gain access to the track bed. Negotiations were started with the liquidator to buy the trackbed, and with the local authorities to obtain planning permission. There seems to have been no mention either of an abandonment, or an amending order, but any sale would have been unlawful without one. The liquidator seems to have responded well to the society and soon came to accept it as a viable would-be purchaser. He even gave them permission to enter on to the trackbed around Beddgelert, to begin clearance work while negotiations continued. Merionethshire County Council gave planning permission for the southern end of the route, but Caernarvonshire County Council proved particularly obstructive to the WHR's revival. During the early years, negotiations were sometimes hampered by other interests: a couple of parties wishing to build miniature railways on the trackbed; cycling and walking charities (who wished to open up the trackbed as a footpath/cycleway); and Caernarvonshire County Council's own surveyors (who listed some fifteen points where road improvements would affect the railway). Peter Johnson notes: \"There might have been a window where the county council could have got an abandonment order using the Transport Act 1962 in the 1960s; the cost would have been less than \u00a35,000, probably quite a lot less. On reflection, I suspect that its problem was that it could not really demonstrate that acquiring 'all' of the trackbed was within its statutory purposes and justify any expenditure on it. If it was determined, it could have done it.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Johnson", "response": ["Peter Johnson may refer to:", "* Peter Johnson (cricketer, born 1926) (1926\u20132017), English cricketer and Royal Navy officer", "* Peter Johnson (rugby union) (1937\u20132016), Australian national representative rugby union player", "* Peter Johnson (ice hockey, born 1946), retired British ice hockey player", "* Peter Johnson (Nottinghamshire cricketer) (born 1949), English cricketer", "* Peter Johnson (sports executive) (born 1950), American sports agent and business executive", "* Peter Johnson (footballer, born 1954), English football player", "* Peter Johnson (skier) (born 1956), American mogul skier", "* Peter Johnson (footballer, born 1958), English football player", "* Peter Johnson (ice hockey coach) (born 1959), American ice hockey coach and scout", "* Peter Johnson (pirate) (died 1672), Dutch pirate active in the Caribbean", "* Peter Johnson (Medal of Honor) (1857\u20131943), United States Navy sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "* Peter Johnson (RAF officer) (1908\u20131999), Royal Air Force officer and author", "* Peter Johnson Sr. (1921\u20132012), American lawyer", "* Peter Johnson (architect) (1923\u20132003), Australian architect and academic administrator", "* Leslie Peter Johnson (1930\u20132016), British medievalist", "* Peter Johnson (businessman) (born 1939), formerly involved with Everton FC", "* Peter Johnson (Australian politician) (born 1943), Australian politician", "* Peter Johnson (poet) (born 1951), American poet, and novelist", "* Peter Johnson (entrepreneur) (born 1956), British academic and entrepreneur", "* Peter Johnson (railway historian) (fl. 1974\u20132017), British railway author and historian", "* Peter Johnson (Maine politician) (fl. 2006\u20132014), American politician from Maine"]}]}}
