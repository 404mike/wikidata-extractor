He rose steadily in the Service and by 1820 had become Deputy Secretary to the Government. On 5 July 1829 he married Frances n\u00e9e Turnour, the second daughter of the Hon. George Turnour and the niece of Cardinal Louis-Fran\u00e7ois de Bausset of Paris. Granville was the second Englishman to write verse about Ceylon, Captain T. A. Anderson being the first. In 1830 a small book of his verses, Poems on Ceylon, was published in Colombo. Granville was appointed by Governor Robert Brownrigg to escort the deposed King of Kandy, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, from Colombo to Madras. He kept a diary of the voyage, which was published in 1830, with his poems as an appendix. Granville retired in 1841 while holding the appointment of Treasurer of Ceylon.\nGranville and his family returned to England and lived at Bath, where he died in January 1864, at the age of seventy-nine. His remains were brought to St Giles' church, Stoke Poges and interred with the rest of the Penn family.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Granville", "response": ["William Granville may refer to:", "* William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath", "* William Granville (civil servant) (1785\u20131864), Treasurer of Ceylon", "* William Granville (famous memer) (1989-), Gamer of Paris"]}, {"page": "Wilmot-Horton executive council of Ceylon", "response": ["|  || William Granville || Treasurer || 19 March 1833 || 7 November 1837 || "]}, {"page": "Stewart-Mackenzie executive council of Ceylon", "response": ["|  || William Granville || rowspan=2|Treasurer || 7 November 1837 || 1841 || Replaced by George Turnour"]}, {"page": "Treasurer of Ceylon", "response": ["| 5 || William Granville || 1823 || 1824 || James Campbell", "| 7 || William Granville || 1 May 1828 || 1841 "]}, {"page": "Index of Sri Lanka\u2013related articles (W\u2013X)", "response": ["# William Granville (civil servant)"]}]}}
