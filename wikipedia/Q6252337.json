But instead of killing his brother, Femur had Sternum shipped off to the Prison Planet. He became quite a hero on the Prison Planet, leading a group of escaped prisoners; he showed a noble air and formed a quick relationship with Jade. When he returns to Planet Bone, he appears to reconcile with his brother. In the Prison Planet, Sternum was tortured, and when, Femur says, \"Hey, you're still alive. It couldn't have been that bad\". Sternum thinks that Femur obviously does not understand how bad it was. Sternum obviously would rather die than to go through the endless torture again, and almost kills Femur for his misunderstanding. When he returns to the Cluster after sacrificing the Prison Planet to teleport the Beast Planet away, Sternum asks Pelvus on information of the Alliance, implying that he intends to take over. Pelvus relays this to Femur but the Emperor believes that his brother has changed, and brushes off the notion. Sternum appears less reptilian and more human than other Bone characters. As he was designed to look muscular and human, his tendrils under his mouth are so short that it looks like he has a chin with three clefts. He is voiced by John Payne."]}, {"page": "G.I.
