He competed at the 1928 and 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1930 British Empire Games. He missed the 1936 Summer Olympics because of injury, and did not compete in the 1934 British Empire Games for Wales, because of English objections. At both Olympics he was eliminated in the first round of the 1500 metres event. At the 1930 Empire Games he won the gold medal in the mile and the silver medal in the 880 yards race. He could not compete for Wales because Wales did not have a national athletics association at the time. Welsh track and field athletes could only compete for England in 1930 although Welsh swimmers did compete for their home nation.In 1940, Heber was commissioned in the Royal Air Force. On 8 June 1944 Thomas, now a flight lieutenant, was awarded the Air Force Cross (AFC).In 1946 he was a squadron leader and  was killed piloting an Avro Lancaster bomber; after take-off from RAF Aston Down all the engines failed and the bomber crashed into a nursing home at Brownshill near Chalford. He was buried at Haycombe Cemetery in Bath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reg Thomas (athletics)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reg Thomas (runner)"]}, {"page": "Reg Thomas (athlete)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reg Thomas (runner)"]}]}}
