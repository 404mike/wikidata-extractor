Born in Poole, Dorset, McManus is a right-handed wicket-keeper batsmen.\nMcManus is a promising wicketkeeper-batsman from Bournemouth who has come through Hampshire's academy. He was part of the county's Under-17 side that won the 50-over cup in 2011 and performed strongly for Hampshire Academy in the Southern Premier League. An average of 36 in second XI cricket earned him a call-up for the England Under-19s in February 2014 where he was named in the World Cup squad.\nMcManus made his Hampshire first team debut on 5 May 2014 against Cardiff MCCU. He scored a century in each innings. Many at the match thought that McManus had become the first English player ever in first-class history to score two centuries on his first-class debut, but this match was not granted first-class status. The reason for this is unclear.\nMcManus made his Hampshire debut against Yorkshire in a County Championship match on 10 May 2015 at Headingley. McManus scored 38 runs in this match, 10 in the first innings before being dismissed by Jack Brooks and 28 in the second innings before being dismissed by Will Rhodes. He though took 4 catches in this match as wicket-keeper, 3 in the first innings of Adam Lyth, Jonny Bairstow and Brooks, and a solitary catch in the second innings of Lyth again as Yorkshire would go on to win by 305 runs.\nOn 23 October 2019, he signed a one-year contract extension with Hampshire to keep him at the club until at least the end of the 2020 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| 42 || Lewis McManus || 2013 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0"]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|18|| Lewis McManus* ||  ||  || Right-handed || \u2014 ||"]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Lewis McManus"]}, {"page": "Clayesmore School", "response": ["* Lewis McManus, Cricket Player for Hampshire Cricket and Hampshire Hawks."]}, {"page": "Adam Wheater", "response": ["There he had a new battle for the gloves, as Michael Bates was a highly-rated keeper. Wheater once again found himself sometimes playing as a specialist batsman. After a spell as first-choice wicket-keeper he once again found himself in a battle, this time with Lewis McManus. He then returned to Essex, even though James Foster was still there. He was only sure of his position as first-choice keeper once Foster retired at the end of the 2018 season."]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club Twenty20 cricket records", "response": ["|Lewis McManus|||| 674", "| 5th || 95 || George Bailey & Lewis McManus || Glamorgan || SSE SWALEC Stadium, Cardiff || 2017"]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club in 2017", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|18|| Lewis McManus ||  ||  || Right-handed || \u2014 ||"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Regional Super50", "response": ["* Lewis McManus"]}]}}
