Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well-founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he cited the example of The Weald as discussed in  Principles of Geology together with other observations from Hugh Miller, James Smith of Jordanhill and Andrew Ramsay. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well-developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years."]}, {"page": "William Ramsay", "response": ["Ramsay was born at 2 Clifton StreetGlasgow Post Office Directory 1852 in Glasgow on 2 October 1852, the son of civil engineer and surveyor,  William C.

In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At this time the Edinburgh school of geologists, prominent among them Sir Andrew Ramsay, with his Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain were maintaining the supreme importance of denudation in the configuration of land surfaces, and particularly the erosion of valleys by the action of running water. Geikie's book, based on extensive personal knowledge of the country, was an able contribution to the doctrines of the Edinburgh school, of which he himself soon began to rank as one of the leaders. In 1880, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society."]}, {"page": "Andrew Crombie Ramsey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Ramsay (geologist)"]}, {"page": "Denudation", "response": ["As denudation came into the wider conscience, questions began to arise of how denudation occurred and what the result was. As for the result of denudation, Hutton and Playfair suggested that over a period of time the landscape would eventually be worn down to erosional planes at or near sea level which gave the theory the name planation. Charles Lyell proposed that marine planation, or oceans and ancient shallow seas, were the primary driving force behind denudation. While surprising given the centuries of observation of fluvial and pluvial erosion, this is more understandable given that early geomorphology was largely developed in Britain, where the effects of coastal erosion are more evident and plays a larger role in geomorphic processes. There was more evidence against marine planation than there was for it. By the 1860s marine planation had largely fell from favor, led by Andrew Ramsay, a former proponent of marine planation, recognizing that rain and rivers play a more important role in denudation. In North America during the mid-19th century, there were advancements made in identifying fluvial, pluvial, and glacial erosion. The work being done in the Appalachians and American West that formed the basis for W.M. Davis to hypothesize peneplanation, despite that while peneplanation was compatible in the Appalachians, it did not work as well in the more active American West. Peneplanation was a cycle where young landscapes were produced by uplift and were denudated down to sea level, which is the base level. The process would be restarted when the old landscape was uplifted again or when the base level was lowered, producing a new young landscape. Publication of the Davisian cycle of erosion caused many geologists to begin looking for evidence of planation around the world. Unsatisfied with Davis's cycle due to evidence from the Western United States, Grove Karl Gilbert suggested that backwearing of slopes would shape landscapes into pediplains, and W.J. McGee named these landscapes pediments. This later giving the concept the name pediplanation when L.C. King applied it to a global scale. The dominance of the Davisian cycle gave rise to several theories to explain planation such as eolation and glacial planation, although only etchplanation survived time and scrutiny as it was based on observations and measurements done in different climates around the world, and it explained irregularities in landscapes. The majority of these concepts failed, one reason being that Joseph Jukes, a popular geologist and professor, separated denudation and uplift in an 1862 publication which had a lasting impact on geomorphology. Other major reasons are that the cycles, Davis's in particular, were generalizations based on broad observations of the landscape and not detailed measurements, a lot of the concepts were developed based on local or specific processes, not regional processes, and they assumed long periods of continental stability."]}, {"page": "Reactions to On the Origin of Species", "response": ["It was known that the geologic time scale was \"incomprehensibly vast\", if unquantifiable.
