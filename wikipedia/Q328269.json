Despite his formal leadership role, however, his only actual title was \"colonial secretary\", a position comparable to a minister of internal affairs. His successor, William Fox, was also given a formal leadership role, but was not colonial secretary. When Frederick Weld became the sixth person appointed to formal leadership, a substantive leadership title, \"premier\", appeared. Weld's successor, Edward Stafford, briefly changed the title to \"first minister\", but it was soon restored to premier during the second tenure of Fox. From that point, the term \"premier\" was used almost exclusively for the remainder of the 19th century. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the Civil List of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the head of government, referred to as the \"Prime Minister\"."]}, {"page": "New Zealand Wars", "response": ["In November 1864 Premier Frederick Weld introduced a policy of \"self-reliance\" for New Zealand, which included the gradual but complete withdrawal of Imperial troops, who would be replaced by a colonial force of 1,500. The move came at a time of rising conflict between Grey, who sought more extensive military operations to \"pacify\" the west coast of the North Island between Taranaki and Wanganui, and Cameron, who regarded such a campaign as unnecessary, impractical and contrary to Imperial policy.. Grey blocked Cameron's attempts to dispatch the first regiments from New Zealand in May 1865 and the first regiment finally embarked in January 1866. By May 1867 only the 2/18th Regiment remained in the country, their departure delayed by political pressure over the \"peril\" still facing settlers; the last soldiers finally left in February 1870.."]}, {"page": "Coat of arms of Western Australia", "response": ["The black swan is the official bird emblem of Western Australia, although only formally adopted in 1973.  It also as appears on the State Badge as a black swan silhouetted against a yellow disk.  The badge is shown in the fly of the State Flag that was adopted in 1870, and revised in 1953.  At the time of the badge's adoption, the colonial Governor, Frederick Weld, wrote that \"This Colony at its commencement was usually known as the Swan River Settlement, and the Black Swan is represented upon its seal, and has always been considered as its special badge, or cognizance.\"The State Flag, WA Department of Premier & Cabinet   The swan sits on a rippled blue and white base to depict it in its natural state, swimming on an estuary or lake."]}, {"page": "Flag of Western Australia", "response": ["An Order in Council was promulgated on 17\u00a0August 1869, instructing British colonial governors to fly the British ensign defaced with the coat of arms or badge of the territory.  On 3\u00a0January of the following year, Frederick Weld, the Governor of Western Australia, put forward a proposed design of the badge that depicted a black swan on a yellow backdrop.  His reasoning for this sketch was that the colony \"at its commencement was usually known as the Swan River Settlement, and the Black Swan is represented upon its seal, and has always been considered as its special badge, or cognizance\".  The design was officially confirmed in a despatch bearing the date of 27 November 1875 by his successor, William C. F. Robinson.

By 20 September there were further deaths following a M\u0101ori ambush at Warea and reprisals by the 43rd Regiment and Mounted Corps. Further skirmishing took place near Hawera and Patea in October and November. Cameron's replacement, Major-General Trevor Chute, arrived in New Plymouth on 20 September to take command of operations just as Premier Frederick Weld's policy of military self-reliance took effect and the withdrawal of British troops from New Zealand began. The 70th and 65th Regiments were the first to leave the country, with Imperial regiments gradually being concentrated at Auckland."]}, {"page": "Harry Atkinson", "response": ["The death of William Cutfield King in February 1861 caused a by-election in the Grey and Bell electorate. Atkinson was elected to Parliament unopposed. In 1864, he was made Defence Minister in the government of Frederick Weld. He was highly active in this portfolio, advocating a policy of self-reliance in the conduct of the war. In 1866, however, he retired due to the death of his wife Amelia (whom he had married in 1856). The following year, he married his cousin Annie. He returned to parliament from 1867 to 1869 for the Town of New Plymouth electorate, but in April 1869 he resigned to concentrate on maintaining his farm."]}, {"page": "Edward Stafford (politician)", "response": ["When Fox's government fell one year later, Stafford had the opportunity to become Premier again, but declined. His stated reason for doing so was his hostility to Governor George Grey, whom Stafford believed he would be unable to override on policy matters \u2013 Stafford did not wish to become Premier if the Governor would simply block his policies. Instead, Alfred Domett took the premiership. Domett's premiership has been described as \"like a Stafford ministry without Stafford\", although the invasion of the Waikato began in July 1863. Domett was replaced by Frederick Whitaker after little more than a year, but Whitaker himself only lasted a similar time before being replaced by Frederick Weld. Weld, like Domett, followed policies similar to Stafford, although did not enjoy good personal relations with him."]}, {"page": "Governor of Western Australia", "response": ["| The Hon.
