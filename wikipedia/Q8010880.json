Other family members named on the monument include his son, Robert, who was killed in action in France in 1915, and a descendant, Frederick, who was killed in action at sea in 1940.The Harker memorial was in a neglected state in 2006, but it was discovered that there was a forgotten Harker Trust Fund which had been set up to maintain both the memorial and  churchyard.
