Michael O'Connor doubled Scunthorpe's advantage in second-half injury time with a finish from an acute angle, before substitute Josh Walker scored two minutes later to half the deficit.

A 0\u20130 draw against Yeovil Town followed a week later, with John Mousinho missing a penalty with ten minutes remaining. The penalty came about as a result of Yeovil's Luke Ayling handling the ball on the line, receiving a straight red card. There was a \"great sense of injustice around the ground\" as Mark Roberts scored the rebound after Ayling had handled \u2014 with the referee refusing to give Stevenage the advantage and instead opting to award the penalty. Three days after the draw, on 25 October, Stevenage travelled to Brentford, winning the match 1\u20130, their second away victory of the campaign.

A first half brace from centre back Richard Hinds and a debut goal from winger Keanu Marsh-Brown helped Yeovil to a comfortable 3\u20130 victory over their League One rivals. The draw for the second round of the League Cup took place the following day and presented Yeovil with a home tie against Premier League side West Bromwich Albion. Prior to the first match of the league season, on 18 August, the Football League Trophy draw took place on Soccer AM with Yeovil drawn away against Bristol Rovers in the first round of the competition. Later in the day, in Yeovil's opening league match against Coventry City the club fell behind early from a Cody McDonald header, before Richard Hinds scored his third goal in a week as the game ended in a 1\u20131 draw. The following Tuesday, Yeovil's first away game saw a trip to Brentford in an eventful game Yeovil ran out 3\u20131 victors thanks to a brace from James Hayter and a penalty save from Marek \u0160t\u011bch. Hinds's goal scoring form and impressive performances earned him a place in the League One Team of the Week. On 23 August, Chelsea youngster Archange Nkumu joined the club on a one-month loan deal as cover for injured fellow Chelsea loanee Rohan Ince, and Curtis Haynes-Brown left the club to join League Two side AFC Wimbledon on a one-month loan deal.

On 28 August in the League Cup second round tie against West Brom despite an impressive performance and a brace from forward Reuben Reid, the match saw Yeovil eventually overpowered to lose 4\u20132. Yeovil's performances in the month of August led to the nomination of Gary Johnson for Manager of the Month and defender Richard Hinds for Player of the Month, both though lost out to Ronnie Moore and Andy Robinson, both of Tranmere Rovers, respectively.", "On 1 November, after lengthy negotiations with Carlisle United the club agreed to extend the loan of striker Paddy Madden until January, the Irish forward having scored five goals in his five appearances in the first month of his loan deal. Gary Johnson also did not rule out a permanent deal for the Carlisle striker suggesting it was part of the discussions to extend his loan deal. On 3 November, Yeovil's FA Cup ended with a first round away defeat at Preston North End. The 3\u20130 lacklustre defeat was not helped by the sending off of Ed Upson, who coincidentally was sent off in the corresponding league fixture in September. Yeovil's three game winning run in the league came to an abrupt end with a 3\u20131 home defeat against high flying Stevenage despite a further goal by inform loan striker Paddy Madden early in the first half. The club though got back to winning ways the following on 10 November, courtesy of a goal from Bristol City loanee Joe Edwards after seven minutes to give the side a 1\u20130 win over bottom of the league side Hartlepool United. The same day youth team goalkeeper Matt Cafer joined Sherborne Town on a work-experience loan deal. Luke Ayling's performance in the victory over Hartlepool United led to his inclusion in the Football League Team of the Week. Yeovil's inconsistent form continued throughout November with a 4\u20131 defeat at the hands of Swindon Town, including a goal from former striker Andy Williams, followed, on 20 November, by an impressive 1\u20130 away win against Cralwey Town. The conclusion of the loan transfer window saw Yeovil extend the loan of defender Dan Burn until January, and bring in Watford defender Dale Bennett on loan also until the new year. Meanwhile Daniel Johnson returned to Aston Villa, and defender Curtis Haynes-Brown was sent out on loan again this time to Conference National side Cambridge United, it was also announced the club had taken former Canadian international winger Jaime Peters on trial. The team ended the month in 12th place following a 3\u20131 home defeat at the hands of Carlisle United."]}]}}
