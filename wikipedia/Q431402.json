Faidutti said he suggested a kind of \"common pool Can't Stop\" where all the players were in the same situation but could make different decisions. Faidutti described the theme as \"somewhere between Indiana Jones and Alan Quatermain\". Faidutti said the first prototype of the game used an Incan or Mayan temple as the setting. The danger cards were initially frightening noises but those were changed by the publisher. Faidutti said an attempt to add action cards to the game was not successful in playtesting. Friedemann Friese suggested that the card \"that triggered the bust\" be removed from the game and that only one voting token was necessary.", "Alan R. Moon talked with various American publishers and the U.S. edition of the game was published in late 2006 by Sunriver Games.

This is manifested by eliminating elements like randomness and luck to be replaced by skill, strategy, and resource competition, by removing the potential for players to fall irreversibly behind in the early stages of a game, and by reducing the number of rules and possible player options to produce what Alan R. Moon has described as \"elegant game design\".
