He decided to follow his father and grandfather's footsteps by becoming a civil engineer. Brunel attended King's College London from 1859\u20131861, and then gained experience in civil engineering through serving out various apprenticeships. He helped take down his father's Hungerford Bridge with Sir John Hawkshaw so the chains are now at Clifton Suspension Bridge. He conducted initial surveys for a Channel Tunnel. He developed an interest in acting as a hobby, becoming a member of the Scientific and Amateur Dramatic Societies, and also contributed to his brother's biography of their father.Henry is noted for a partnership from 1878 with Sir John Wolfe Barry, with whom he designed the Blackfriars Railway Bridge and (after Sir Horace Jones died) Tower Bridge over the River Thames in central London. Their other works included the docks at Barry in south Wales and the Creagan Bridge, a railway bridge over the narrows of Loch Creran in Scotland (jointly credited to Wolfe Barry, Brunel and E.M. Crutwell). Sir Alexander Gibb was a pupil of Brunel and Wolfe Barry in 1895.\nHe also designed the SS Chauncy Maples, which was built in Glasgow in 1899 and transported overland to Lake Nyasa in Africa, where it served for more than one hundred years as a mission and hospital clinic.\n\nBrunel is buried with his father, grandfather, and other family members at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Wolfe Barry", "response": ["Wolfe Barry was educated at Glenalmond and King's College, London, where he was a pupil of civil engineer Sir John Hawkshaw, as was his business partner Henry Marc Brunel, son of the great Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Barry and Hawkshaw worked on railway bridge crossings across the Thames, among other projects. Brunel pursued his own business from 1871, but in 1878 went into partnership with Barry. Barry began his own practice in 1867, and carried out more work for the railways.", "However, it was Tower Bridge that made Wolfe Barry's name. In 1878, architect Horace Jones first proposed a bascule bridge. An Act of Parliament allowing the Corporation of the City of London to build it was passed in 1885. Jones was appointed architect, and developed an initial scheme for which he was knighted in 1886. Wolfe Barry, already well-established with experience of bridges across the Thames, was introduced as the engineer for the project and with Henry Marc Brunel redesigned the mechanisms resulting in a modified plan. Within a month of construction starting Sir Horace Jones died, leaving Wolfe Barry and Brunel to oversee and complete the works. The bridge was completed in 1894."]}, {"page": "Blackfriars Railway Bridge", "response": ["The second bridge, built slightly further downstream (to the east), was originally called St Paul's Railway Bridge and opened in 1886. It was designed by John Wolfe-Barry and Henry Marc Brunel and is made of wrought iron. It was built by Lucas and Aird.Where Thames Smooth Waters Glide When St Paul's railway station changed its name to Blackfriars in 1937 the name of the bridge was changed as well."]}, {"page": "Alexander Gibb", "response": ["Gibb was born in Broughty Ferry, Forfarshire, the son of civil engineer Alexander Easton Gibb and his wife, Hope Brown Paton. He was the great-grandson of John Gibb, an early member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a colleague of its first President, Thomas Telford. He was educated at the High School of Dundee, the Abbey School in Beckenham, Rugby School and University College London, although he left the latter after a year to become articled to the prominent civil engineers John Wolfe Barry and Henry Marc Brunel. Having completed his training, he became resident engineer on the Metropolitan District Railway's Whitechapel and Bow Railway extension. He joined his father's company, Easton, Gibb & Son, in 1900 when they were building the King Edward VII Bridge at Kew. In the same year Gibb married Norah Isobel Monteith (1879-1940), daughter of Fleet Surgeon John Lowry Monteith RN, and they had three sons, including Lieutenant Colonel Alistair Monteith Gibb."]}, {"page": "Isambard Kingdom Brunel", "response": ["Brunel was survived by his wife, Mary, and three children: Isambard Brunel Junior (1837\u20131902), Henry Marc Brunel (1842\u20131903) and Florence Mary Brunel (1847\u20131876).
