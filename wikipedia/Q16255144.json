The original elderly residents included Lou Beale (Anna Wing), Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Dot Cotton (June Brown). Over the years they have been joined by the likes of Mo Butcher (Edna Dor\u00e9), Jules Tavernier (Tommy Eytle), Marge Green (Pat Coombs), Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly), Jim Branning (John Bardon), Charlie Slater (Derek Martin), Mo Harris (Laila Morse), Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), Les Coker (Roger Sloman), Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins), Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), Stan Carter (Timothy West), Babe Smith (Annette Badland), Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe), Ted Murray (Christopher Timothy), Joyce Murray (Maggie Steed), Arshad Ahmed (Madhav Sharma), Mariam Ahmed (Indira Joshi) and Vi Highway (Gwen Taylor). The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who portrayed Lou Beale in the show. She commented, \"I don't want to be disloyal, but I think you need a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced. It gets too lightweight.\""]}, {"page": "1999 in film", "response": ["| Entrapment || 20th Century Fox / Regency Enterprises || Jon Amiel (director); Ronald Bass, William Broyles Jr. (screenplay); Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton, Maury Chaykin, Kevin McNally, Terry O'Neill, Madhav Sharma, David Yip, Tim Potter, Rolf Saxon || Action, Romance || Live action"]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Awakening || Orion Pictures / EMI Films || Mike Newell (director); Chris Bryant, Allan Scott, Clive Exton (screenplay); Charlton Heston, Susannah York, Jill Townsend, Stephanie Zimbalist, Patrick Drury, Bruce Myers, Nadim Sawalha, Ian McDiarmid, Ahmed Osman, Miriam Margoyles, Michael Mellinger, Leonard Maguire, Ishia Bennison, Madhav Sharma, Chris Fairbanks, Michael Halphie || Horror || Live action"]}, {"page": "Entrapment (film)", "response": ["* Madhav Sharma as Security Chief"]}, {"page": "Doomwatch", "response": ["Cast: John Paul as Dr Spencer Quist, Simon Oates as Dr John Ridge, John Barron as The Minister, Elizabeth Weaver as Dr Anne Tarrant, John Bown as Commander Neil Stafford, Joby Blanshard as Colin Bradley, Vivien Sherrard as Barbara Mason, Michael Elwyn as Duncan, Ahmad Nagi, Farhat Shamsi, Talib Shamsi and Rahat Shamsi as Indian Family, Madhav Sharma as Hanif Kahn, Cec Linder as Senator Connell, Lorna Lewis as Miss Brandon, Maria O\u2019Brien as Susan Proud, Marc Zuber, Bill Ward and John Wyman as Reporters, Renu Setna as His Excellency.
