For his work in combating homophobia, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire.Pitter grew up in Balham, South London. His parents, Vincent and Evelyn, were Jamaican immigrants. Pitter realised at the age of 10 that he was gay, and dealt with homophobic abuse from his schoolmates. He has played football since his youth for a number of amateur clubs. He was chosen to play midfield for the Sutton United youth team and had a trial at Wimbledon. While playing for his local club, he suffered homophobia from other players and was dropped from the first team to the fourth team after one of his teammates found out that he was gay. Observing that they wanted him gone, Pitter quit. In 1991, after seeing a listing in Capital Gay and Time Out, he joined a group of gay men playing football in Regent's Park. This was Stonewall F.C., the first gay football club in Britain.\nIn November 2010, he was informed that he would be appointed a MBE for his work against homophobia in football. His father died shortly after, before the New Year Honours list was made public in December. Pitter collected his MBE from Buckingham Palace on 8 February 2011 accompanied by his sister, his fianc\u00e9, and his future mother-in-law.
