Housley was a right-handed batsman.  He was born at Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire.\nHousley made a single first-class appearance for Nottinghamshire against Yorkshire at Trent Bridge in 1870.  Yorkshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 108 all out.  In response, Nottinghamshire made just 56 all out, with Housley being dismissed by George Freeman for 2 runs.  In their second-innings, Yorkshire were dismissed for 122, leaving Nottinghamshire with a target of 175 for victory.  Nottinghamshire fell narrowly short of reaching that target, being dismissed for 172 to lose by 2 runs.  During their chase, Housley was run out for a single run.  This was his only major appearance for the county.\nHe later stood as an umpire in two first-class matches at Bramall Lane in 1877, with Yorkshire playing Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.  He died at the village of his birth on 23 April 1881.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Housley, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Housley"]}]}}
