He played for Swansea Town and Porth before joining Manchester United in 1922. He went on to make more than 100 appearances in the Football League for the club. He later played for Merthyr Town. During his career, he won a single cap for the Wales national football team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank McPherson", "response": ["Despite that brief run-out at centre-forward, McPherson played exclusively at outside left in 1924\u201325, missing just four games. He was also a more prolific goalscorer, his seven goals in 38 league appearances helping the club to a second-place finish at the end of the season and promotion back to the First Division. He began the following season as the starting outside left, playing in the first seven games before the re-emergence of Harry Thomas cost him his place, starting with the game against Burnley on 26 September 1925. McPherson made a goalscoring return to the team as a centre-forward on 24 October, scoring twice in a 2\u20130 away win over Cardiff City; he retained the number 9 shirt for much of the rest of the season, before a three-game spell without scoring culminated in a 7\u20130 defeat away to Blackburn Rovers; Charlie Rennox, Jimmy Hanson and Chris Taylor shared centre-forward duties for the remaining six games of the season. Despite being dropped for the final six games, McPherson finished the season with a career-high 16 league goals, and a further four in the FA Cup, in which Manchester United reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by rivals Manchester City. McPherson's new-found scoring form was attributed to his pace, coupled with a change to the offside law, which now only required two defenders between the attacking player and the opposing goal line for the attacker to be onside."]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Harry Thomas (disambiguation), multiple people", "**Harry Thomas (bishop) (1897\u20131955), Bishop of Taunton", "**Harry Thomas (footballer) (born 1901), Welsh football striker", "**Harry Thomas, Sr. (1922\u20131999), politician in Washington, D.C."]}, {"page": "Harry Thomas", "response": ["Harry Thomas may refer to:", "*Harry Thomas (rugby league), New Zealand rugby league footballer of the 1920s", "*Harry Thomas (footballer) (1901\u2013?), Welsh football striker", "*Harry Thomas Jr. (born 1960), politician in Washington, D.C.", "*Harry Thomas Sr. (1922\u20131999), politician in Washington, D.C.", "* Harry Thomas (1909 - 1996) Hollywood Make-up man who worked on films directed by Ed Wood, Roger Corman and many others", "*Harry Thomas (bishop) (1897\u20131955), Bishop of Taunton", "*Harry Thomas, musician in Tinhorn"]}]}}
