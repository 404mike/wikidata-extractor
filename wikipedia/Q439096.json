The Chronicle records several battles of Ceawlin's between the years 556 and 592, including the first record of a battle between different groups of Anglo-Saxons, and indicates that under Ceawlin Wessex acquired significant territory, some of which was later to be lost to other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.

According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from his commitment to the Christian faith.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 74\u201375 As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one dedicated to pagan gods and the other to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of R\u00e6dwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy.

He must have reigned for some time after \u00c6thelberht died, in order for him to have been noted as a bretwalda. Barbara Yorke suggests that he died before Edwin converted to Christianity in 627 and also before Paulinus became bishop of Northumbria in 625.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 60 His death is recorded twice by Roger of Wendover, in 599 and in 624, in a history that dates from the 13th century but appears to include earlier annals of unknown origin and reliability.

The location of the battle is unknown, but may be Kingstanding Hill,  north-west of Reading. According to Asser's account, the Vikings arrived first at the battle ground and deployed along the top of the ridge, giving them the advantage. They divided their forces into two contingents, one under their two kings and the other under their earls. When the West Saxons saw this, they decided to copy the formation, with \u00c6thelred facing the kings and Alfred the earls. The king then retired to his tent to hear Mass, while Alfred led his forces to the battlefield. Both sides formed their forces into shield walls. \u00c6thelred would not cut short his devotions and Alfred risked being outflanked and overwhelmed by the whole Danish army. He decided to attack and led his men in a charge. Battle then raged around a small thorn tree and finally the West Saxons were victorious. Although Asser emphasises Alfred's role in the victory and implies that \u00c6thelred was dilatory, in the view of the military historian John Peddie, \u00c6thelred was militarily correct to delay joining the battle until the situation was in his favour.  The Vikings suffered heavy losses, including King Bagsecg and five earls, Sidroc the Old, Sidroc the Younger, Osbern, Fr\u00e6na and Harold. The West Saxons followed the Viking flight until nightfall, cutting them down.

Cyril Hart argues that the contradictions regarding the identity of Edward's mother, and the fact that Edmund appears to have been regarded as the legitimate heir until his death in 971, suggest that Edward was probably illegitimate. However, Barbara Yorke thinks that \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was Edgar's wife, but \u00c6lfthryth was a consecrated queen when she gave birth to her sons, who were therefore considered more \"legitimate\" than Edward.Yorke, \"The Women in Edgar's Life\", pp. 147\u201348 \u00c6thelwold denied that Edward was legitimate, but Yorke considers this \"opportunist special pleading\".Yorke, \"\u00c6thelwold and the Politics of the Tenth Century\", p. 86"]}, {"page": "Edgar the Peaceful", "response": ["Wulfthryth of Wilton, who was educated at Wilton Abbey became his second consort.

Beorhtric died in 802, and Ecgberht came to the throne of Wessex, probably with the support of Charlemagne and perhaps also the papacy.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p. 186. The Mercians continued to oppose Ecgberht: the day of his accession, the Hwicce (who had originally formed a separate kingdom, but by that time were part of Mercia) attacked, under the leadership of their ealdorman, \u00c6thelmund. Weohstan, a Wessex ealdorman, met him with men from Wiltshire; according to a 15th-century source, Weohstan had married Alburga, Ecgberht's sister, and so was his brother-in-law.The source, a poem in the Chronicon Vilodunense, is described by Yorke as \"admittedly . . . far from ideal\". See Barbara Yorke, \"Edward as \u00c6theling\", in Higham & Hill, Edward the Elder, p. 36. The Hwicce were defeated, though Weohstan was killed as well as \u00c6thelmund. Nothing more is recorded of Ecgberht's relations with Mercia for more than twenty years after this battle. It seems likely that Ecgberht had no influence outside his own borders, but on the other hand there is no evidence that he ever submitted to the overlordship of Cenwulf. Cenwulf did have overlordship of the rest of southern England, but in Cenwulf's charters the title of \"overlord of the southern English\" never appears, presumably in consequence of the independence of the kingdom of Wessex.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 225."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex", "response": ["Little is known of \u00c6thelbald's reign and only two of his charters survive.

S 326, dated 860, is a grant by \u00c6thelbald of fourteen hides at Teffont in Wiltshire to a thegn called Osmund. Both are attested by Judith, an indication of her high status, as ninth-century West Saxon kings' wives were not normally given the rank of queen and almost never witnessed charters. The marriage and attestations are evidence that \u00c6thelbald intended the succession to pass to his own son, not his brothers. S 326 is also attested by King \u00c6thelberht, suggesting that he was on good terms with his brother.

P. Kirby regards Wilfrid's championing of Oswald as being a contributing factor in Wilfrid's expulsion from York in 678. Kirby believes that Ecgfrith felt Wilfrid was promoting Oswald's branch of the Northumbrian royal family over his own. One of Wilfrid's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Willibrord, became a missionary to the Frisians in 695, perhaps inspired by Wilfrid's example. Willibrord may have felt it expedient to leave Northumbria, where he was known as one of Wilfrid's followers.John Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England p. 57", "One commentator has said that Wilfrid \"came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age\".Quoted in Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 62 Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that \"Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility\". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that \"Wilfrid's character was such that he seems to have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure\". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop.Brown Rise of Western Christendom Second Edition pp. 363\u2013364 The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.John Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England pp. 35\u201337"]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred of Mercia", "response": ["By the 7th century, England was almost entirely divided into kingdoms ruled by the Anglo-Saxons who had come to Britain two hundred years before.
