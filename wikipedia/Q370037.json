Arthur Cayley raised the problem at a meeting of the London Mathematical Society in 1879. The same year, Alfred Kempe published a paper that claimed to establish the result, and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved.

An antiparallelogram is an important feature in the design of Hart's inversor, a linkage that (like the Peaucellier\u2013Lipkin linkage) can convert rotary motion to straight-line motion. An antiparallelogram-shaped linkage can also be used to connect the two axles of a four-wheeled vehicle, decreasing the turning radius of the vehicle relative to a suspension that only allows one axle to turn. A pair of nested antiparallelograms was used in a linkage defined by Alfred Kempe as part of Kempe's Universality Theorem stating that any algebraic curve may be traced out by the joints of a suitably defined linkage. Kempe called the nested-antiparallelogram linkage a \"multiplicator\", as it could be used to multiply an angle by an integer. Kempe's original proof overlooked the parallelogram-antiparallelogram instability, but bracing the linkages fixes the proof."]}, {"page": "Kempe", "response": ["* Alfred Kempe (1849\u20131922), English mathematician"]}, {"page": "Alfred Bray Kempe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Kempe"]}, {"page": "Sir Alfred Bray Kempe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Kempe"]}, {"page": "Sir Alfred Kempe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Kempe"]}, {"page": "List of incomplete proofs", "response": ["* In 1879, Alfred Kempe published a purported proof of the four color theorem, whose validity as a proof was accepted for eleven years before it was refuted by Percy Heawood.

In 1874 he joined the Francis Fairlie Touring Company for who he appeared in East Lynne by Alfred Kempe, in Progress by C. R. Munro and The School for Scandal by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, followed by seasons in Bristol, Glasgow, Kilmarnock, Liverpool and Birmingham. His first role in London was at his father's benefit at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in March 1877 in which he played Alfred Evelyn in Money by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, going on to appear in his father's second benefit in Manchester later in the same month.
