He estimated their territory to cover .  According to Norman Tindale, however, the Gubbi Gubbi people were an inland group living in the Wide Bay\u2013Burnett area, and their lands extended over  and lay west of Maryborough. The northern borders ran as far as Childers and Hervey Bay. On the south, they approached the headwaters of the Mary River and Cooroy. Westwards, they reached as far as the Coast Ranges and Kilkivan. Gubbi Gubbi country is currently located between Pumicestone Road, near Caboolture in the south, through to Childers in the north. Their country was originally rain forest, with cleared areas created by regular firing of the scrub.", "thumb|left|John Mathew's 1910 map of the country of the Kabi and Wakka peoples.", "The escaped convict James Davis, in addition to dwelling with several other tribes, is said to have lived for a time with the Gubbi Gubbi. John Mathew, a clergyman turned anthropologist, also spent five years with them at Manumbar and mastered their language. He described their society in a 1910 monograph, Two Representative Tribes of Queensland. The Gubbi Gubbi people he grew up with numbered no more than a score by the early 1880s, and by 1906, after they had been forcibly removed to the Barambah reserve, (an Aboriginal reserve created under the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 ), he stated that only 3-4 full-blooded members of the group remained among the 'remnants'."]}, {"page": "Lorimer Fison", "response": ["Fison returned to Australia in 1884 and for most of the remainder of his life lived near Melbourne. He retired from the ministry in 1888 and from then to 1905 edited the Spectator and made it one of the best Melbourne church papers. At the meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science held at Hobart in 1892 he was president of the anthropological section, and from the chair, with charming candour, pointed out that a theory of the Kurnai system, which he had worked out with infinite pains in Kamilaroi and Kurnai, was \"not worth a rush\". In 1894 he visited England and attended the meeting of the British association at Oxford. There he met Max M\u00fcller, Professor Edward Burnett Tylor and many other distinguished scientists. At Cambridge he became acquainted with Dr., later Sir James Frazer, who was much impressed by his frank and manly nature. Fison was critical of John Mathew's book Eaglehawk and Crow (1899), seemingly provoked by Mathew's challenge to his own group-marriage theories and perhaps by Mathew's amateur status."]}, {"page": "Percy Leason", "response": ["In 1928, Leason contended some figures described by the ethnologist John Mathew in 1897 were merely natural stains in the rock, which caused some controversy."]}, {"page": "John Mathew (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Mathew (1849 \u2013 1929) was an Australian Presbyterian minister and anthropologist.", "John Mathew may also refer to:", "*John Mathew (MP) for Shaftesbury", "*John Mathews (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Wakka Wakka", "response": ["The Wakawaka language belongs to the Waka\u2013Kabic branch of the Pama-Nyungan languages.
