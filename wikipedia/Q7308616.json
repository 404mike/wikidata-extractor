He served in the Second Boer War from 1899\u20131902 and was decorated with the Queens Medal, three clasps, and the King's Medal, two clasps. It was during this period that he conceived of his version of a water clock. \nHe served again in the First World War, and was gassed in 1918 while commanding 4th Guards Brigade. At the conclusion of his service, he had attained the rank of Brigadier General. \nHis other vocation was gardening, and indeed the gardens at Killruddery, the Meath family estate, now figure more highly in tourist books than the house itself. \nHe was made a CBE in 1919 and died on 10 March 1949 aged 79 at Killruddery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
