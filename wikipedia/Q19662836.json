He began work in the Etruria factory as an \"ingenious boy\", in Josiah Wedgwood's phrase, where he was \"... of the greatest value and consequence in finishing fine small work.\" In time, he became head of ornamental art for the firm. He modelled many of Wedgwood's 18th-century portrait medallions, including those of Wedgwood himself, George III, and Queen Charlotte. His portraits of David Garrick and Shakespeare were signed but most were not. His work for the 18th-century abolitionist movement, Am I Not a Man and a Brother (circa 1787), perhaps to a design by Wedgwood himself, was widely distributed by the anti-slavery movement.\nA surviving contract between Josiah Wedgwood and William Hackwood, dated November 1777, specifies that Hackwood's basic wage was to be \u00a31 11s 6d. per week and that his house was to be rent-free. Additional payments were made on a per-piece basis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Josiah Wedgwood", "response": ["Wedgwood was a prominent slavery abolitionist.

Wedgwood mass-produced cameos depicting the seal for the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade and had them widely distributed, which thereby became a popular and celebrated image. The Wedgwood medallion was the most famous image of a black person in all of 18th-century art. The actual design of the cameo was probably done by either William Hackwood or Henry Webber who were modellers in his Stoke-on-Trent factory.\"Am I Not a Man and a Brother?\", 1787"]}, {"page": "Jasperware", "response": ["The artists used for jasperware cannot always be identified, as they are not named on pieces they designed.

The vase was lent to Wedgwood by the third Duke of Portland from 1786. Wedgwood devoted four years of painstaking trials at duplicating the vase in black and white jasperware, which was finally completely in 1790, the figures perhaps modelled by William Hackwood.  The replica was exhibited in London in that year, with the initial showing restricted to 1,900 tickets, which soon sold out.  Wedgwood's careful copies proved extremely useful when the vase was smashed in the British Museum in 1845, and then reconstructed by the restorer John Doubleday.  The original edition was of 50 copies; in 1838 a further edition was cast in one piece, with the background then painted.Savage, 195, 197", "File:Quiver vase, modeling attributed to William Hackwood, 1785-1790, solid pale blue jasper, dark blue dip, white reliefs - Wedgwood Museum - Barlaston, Stoke-on-Trent, England - DSC09647.jpg|Quiver vase, modelling attributed to William Hackwood, 1785-1790, solid pale blue jasper, dark blue dip."]}, {"page": "Wedgwood", "response": ["*William Hackwood worked for Wedgwood from 1769 until 1832, starting at around 13, but after some years becoming the main modeller in the factory, finishing and making the moulds for the designs of others, and sculpting his own.Wedgwood Museum: Hackwood's legacy  "]}, {"page": "Marlborough gem", "response": ["Once in the Marlborough collection, the gem was often redrawn: Giovanni Battista Cipriani painted a version of the gem,Sherwin's engraving after Cipriani, from Jacob Bryant, A New System, or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology (London, 1775), was illustrated by Jean H.
