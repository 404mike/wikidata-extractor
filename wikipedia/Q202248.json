Francis' only daughter Frances married a Gale, and her granddaughter, married to a Wade, took the additional surname of Dalton on inheriting the estate. The estate was owned by three generations of Wade-Daltons, of whom William Lechmere Wade-Dalton was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1935\u201336, before it passed to a distant kinsman, the diplomat Richard Dalton. He was a direct descendant of the original purchaser and moved in with his family in 1981."]}]}}
