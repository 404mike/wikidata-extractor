He linked up with Russell Slade once more who signed Cohen on a season long loan deal from his Scottish parent club. Primarily used as a forward at his previous clubs, Cohen became a makeshift right and left sided midfielder and his performances soon earned him a permanent deal when he was signed for an undisclosed fee in February 2006. Cohen was part of the Grimsby side that defeated Tottenham Hotspur in the second round of the League Cup and the eventual defeat against Newcastle United in the following round. He was also part of the side that lost the League Two Play-off final against Cheltenham Town which condemned Grimsby to a third successive season in the fourth tier of English football."]}, {"page": "Richard Keogh", "response": ["At the time, Stoke was owned by an Icelandic consortium and in June 2004, Keogh and striker Jermaine Palmer were sent out on loan to Icelandic club Knattspyrnuf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 V\u00edkingur.
