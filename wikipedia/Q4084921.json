Archer beat Ian Gow to the selection after winning over a substantial proportion of younger members at the selection meeting. The national party had concerns about Archer's selection, specifically relating to the UNA expenses allegations made by Humphry Berkeley, himself a former Conservative MP.  Berkeley tried to persuade the Conservative Central Office that Archer was unsuitable as a parliamentary candidate. Archer brought a defamation action against Berkeley and the story was kept out of the press, although a truncated version of the story did appear in The Times. The case was eventually settled out of court, with Archer agreeing to pay legal costs of around \u00a330,000."]}, {"page": "Harold Macmillan", "response": ["Macmillan had often play-acted being an old man long before real old age set in. As early as 1948 Humphry Berkeley wrote of how \"he makes a show of being feeble and decrepit\", mentioning how he had suddenly stopped shambling and sprinted for a train. Nigel Fisher tells an anecdote of how Macmillan initially greeted him to his house leaning on a stick, but later walked and climbed steps perfectly well, twice acting lame again and fetching his stick when he remembered his \"act\". However, in genuine old age he became almost blind, causing him to need sticks and a helping arm.Fisher 1982, pp. 361\u201362"]}, {"page": "Hoax letter writers", "response": ["* H.

Despite denials by the whips, Redmayne let slip in a radio interview (19 December 1963, subsequently published in The Listener) about the four questions they asked: namely, their first and second preferences as leader, whether or not there was any candidate they especially opposed and whether they would in principle accept Home as leader.Shepherd 1994, p. 324. Humphry Berkeley refused to answer the \"hypothetical question\" of whether he would support Home as compromise between Butler and Hailsham.Shepherd 1994, p. 323. Jim Prior (then a backbencher) and Willie Whitelaw (then a junior minister) later recalled how they felt the whips were pushing Home's candidacy. Prior's first choice was Maudling and second Butler, and he opposed Hailsham but suspected he had been recorded as pro-Home after repeated pushing on the fourth question; Whitelaw thought the fourth question \"improper\"."]}, {"page": "1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*Humphry Berkeley (Lancaster)"]}, {"page": "H.
