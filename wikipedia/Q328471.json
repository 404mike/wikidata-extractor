Similarly American Andrew Valmon gained on Udeme Ekpeyong for Nigeria to his outside.  Coming off the turn, Valmon had the lead and further separated from a slowing Mart\u00ednez.  Kitur and GBR's Roger Black closed to tighten the battle for second.  Kenya passed second as Abednego Matilu led the group through the turn.  But American Gold medalist Quincy Watts was long gone with a 10-metre lead by the break.  Down the backstretch, GBR's David Grindley was able to pass Matilu on the inside followed by Cuba's H\u00e9ctor Herrera on the outside.  At the 200 metre start line, halfway through the lap, Matilu just stopped like he had finished a 200-metre interval, taking Kenya out of the race.  Watts padded another 5 metres to the American lead, passing to future world record holder Michael Johnson.  Watts' 43.1 split was at the time the fastest relay split in history, and today still ranks tied for #4.  Grindley held a metre lead into the handoff to Kriss Akabusi.  Johnson had suffered from food poisoning in Barcelona, which took him out of the 200 metres competition just a few days earlier.  Here Johnson appeared healthy, extending the American lead to over 20 metres.  Behind him, Cuban Norberto T\u00e9llez moved onto Akabusi's shoulder, ready to pounce coming off the final turn, but Akabusi held him off.  Johnson passed off to 1988 gold medalist, world junior record holder Steve Lewis two and a half seconds before Akabusi passed to John Regis and T\u00e9llez to Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez.  The more experienced Hern\u00e1ndez pounced on 200 metre runner Regis through the first turn.  USA had a half a straightaway lead to take the gold unchallenged.  Their new world record time flashed on the scoreboard around the stadium for almost 4 seconds before Hern\u00e1ndez and Regis arrived.", "|\u2022 Roger Black\u2022 David Grindley\u2022 Kriss Akabusi\u2022 John Regis   "]}, {"page": "Kinniku Banzuke", "response": ["| David Grindley, David McKenzie, Germaine Mason, Emma Ania, Hannah England"]}, {"page": "Grindley", "response": ["*David Grindley (born 1972), British 400\u00a0metres runner"]}, {"page": "List of 1992 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["| valign=\"top\"|Roger BlackDavid GrindleyKriss AkabusiJohn RegisDu'aine LadejoMark Richardson "]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1995 Summer Universiade", "response": ["| Anthony WilliamsJared DeaconGary JenningsDavid Grindley||3:02.42"]}, {"page": "1993 European Cup (athletics)", "response": ["| David Grindley||44.75CR", "| Du'aine LadejoKriss AkabusiJohn RegisDavid Grindley||3:00.25CR"]}, {"page": "1991 European Athletics Junior Championships", "response": ["|Kent UlyattAdrian PatrickMark RichardsonDavid Grindley || 3:07.22"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1995 Summer Universiade \u2013 Men's 400 metres", "response": ["| 31 || 1 || align=\"left\" | David Grindley ||align=left|  || 48.36 || Q", "| 16 || 3 || align=\"left\" | David Grindley ||align=left|  || 46.86 || Q", "| 7 || 2 || align=\"left\" | David Grindley ||align=left|  || 46.15 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1995 Summer Universiade \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["|width=200 valign=top|Antony WilliamsJared DeaconGary JenningsDavid Grindley", "| 5 || 1 ||align=left|  || align=left|Antony Williams, Jared Deacon, Gary Jennings, David Grindley || 3:06.40 || Q", "|  || align=left|  || align=left|Antony Williams, Jared Deacon, Gary Jennings, David Grindley || 3:02.42 ||"]}, {"page": "1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver|| David GrindleyAdrian PatrickCraig WinrowMark Richardson  ", "|   || align=left |  || align=left| David GrindleyAdrian PatrickCraig WinrowMark Richardson || 3:03.80 || ", "| 2  || align=left |  || align=left| David GrindleyJim StevensonCraig WinrowAdrian Patrick || 3:07.52 || Q"]}, {"page": "1992 European Athletics Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metres", "response": ["|David Grindley", "| 3 || 2 || align=\"left\" | David Grindley ||align=left|  || 47.42 || Q", "| 7 || 2 || align=\"left\" | David Grindley ||align=left|  || 47.03 || Q", "|  || align=\"left\" | David Grindley ||align=left|  || 46.60 ||"]}, {"page": "1992 UK Athletics Championships", "response": ["The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the Olympic Games.
