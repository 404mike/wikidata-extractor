His collaboration on the 1915 second edition of E. T. Whittaker's A Course of Modern Analysis (1902) produced the classic \"Whittaker and Watson\" text. In 1918 he proved a significant result known as Watson's lemma, that has many applications in the theory on the asymptotic behaviour of exponential integrals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Srinivasa Ramanujan", "response": ["The first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material.

In 1952\u20131954 Schumann, together with H. L. K\u00f6nig, attempted to measure the resonant frequencies. However, it was not until measurements made by Balser and Wagner in 1960\u20131963 that adequate analysis techniques were available to extract the resonance information from the background noise. Since then there has been an increasing interest in Schumann resonances in a wide variety of fields."]}, {"page": "Weierstrass elliptic function", "response": ["* E. T. Whittaker and G. N.
