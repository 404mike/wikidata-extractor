A payment of \u00a3400,000 had to be made in 1849; many of these companies were left in a difficult position with falling revenues, an economic depression and little scope for future shareholder dividends. In York the City Council led by George Leeman were demanding money for the Lendal Bridge project and many of Hudson's allies were unseated at local elections that year.", "On 17 May Hudson resigned from the YNMR to avoid sacking and a committee was set up to look at the allegation that Hudson had used their money to build a private station at Londesborough Park on the Market Weighton line. As 1849 progressed more was unearthed and by the autumn Hudson was being asked to repay \u00a3750,000. He sold Londesborough Park and then paid \u00a3200,000 off to the YNBR (chairman George Leeman) rather than face being taken to court.", "These were heard in 1853 and Hudson lost all three and by winter of that year he had negotiated a settlement of \u00a372,670 to clear all his debts. He had to sell his property at Newby Park and the purchaser Viscount Downe used Hudson's enemy George Leeman to complete his purchase. By 1856 the YNMR debt was \u00a316,000 and this was taken over by the North Eastern Railway upon merger in 1864.", "Following his election as one of the two members of parliament for Sunderland in 1845, Hudson's influence led to his becoming Lord Mayor of York for a third time. One of his ambitions, to build a bridge to link the railway with Lendal in York was high on his agenda. However his attempts to raise money for this project did not go well, as he stated that the YNMR would fund the bridge with the council. However, when the proposal was presented to the Council there was no mention of the YNMR. Alarmed, one of Hudson's bitterest enemies, George Leeman, led the opposition, resulting in Hudson agreeing to pay some of the costs of the bridge design himself.", "On Sunday 9 July 1865 (just before the election) the Sheriff of York arrested Hudson in Whitby and he was taken back to York.the date is suggested to be Monday 10 July by biographer Dr Alf Peacock (1988,89) although most newspapers reported it as the Sunday. Although not proven, it is suggested by two of his biographers that Thompson and George Leeman were behind the arrest.} and Dr Alf Peacock (1988,89). Given that Thompson was the chairman of one of the railways pursuing Hudson for debt and was facing defeat in Whitby, it does seem a likely scenario.", "This estate, bought within a year, effectively ended George Leeman's plans to build a line from York to Market Weighton.

Workforces were loyal and obedient; industrial action in railway towns was rare because the workforce depended on the company.

Experience in local government was heightened by his election as sheriff, equivalent to a deputy mayoral position, in 1870 under Liberal MP George Leeman, who served as Member of Parliament for the City of York constituency for three years prior to his appointment as Lord Mayor. In 1874, Terry became an Alderman of the City, granting him a seat at York's Guildhall for debate in a then partisan chamber under the Conservatives. The party, in response to his growing popularity, allowed him to run for the Lord Mayoralty within the same year, to which he was elected by consensus, defeating the incumbent local brewer, John March.
