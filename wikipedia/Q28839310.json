In a multi-part short documentary series on his death, made by the BBC, his mother stated that she had been concerned about Spiers's mental health prior to his death, and that she believed he had \"gotten involved with the wrong crowd.\" A final video taken of Spiers before his death revealed what his mother interpreted as signs of substance intoxication; she had seen him in a similar state in the past after he had taken heroin.
