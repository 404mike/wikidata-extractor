He dropped back to the inside-forward position, and was described as \"a feistily competitive, yet subtly creative, inside-forward cum wing-half\". However, he disappointed in the 1949\u201350 (one goal in eight games) and 1950\u201351 seasons, before he showed his potential in the 1951\u201352 (11 goals in 34 games) season. He replaced Billy Morris as Jimmy McIlroy's midfield partner in the 1952\u201353 campaign, and scored 16 goals in 46 appearances as the \"Clarets\" posted a sixth-place finish under the stewardship of Frank Hill. Shannon claimed nine goals in 33 matches in the 1953\u201354 campaign, but after Alan Brown was installed as manager he only found the net just once in 43 appearances in 1954\u201355. He scored twice in 44 games in 1955\u201356, claimed two goals in 27 matches in the 1956\u201357 season, and then scored two goals in 38 games in 1957\u201358 under Billy Dougall's stewardship. He fell out of the first team picture under new boss Harry Potts in 1958\u201359, playing just eight games. Shannon retired from playing first-team football in August 1959, and captained Burnley's reserve team for a year.

He scored six goals in his 41 appearances. On 7 November 1957, he scored a hat-trick in a 7\u20133 victory over Leicester City. He finished the 1956\u201357 season with 12 goals in 45 games. He retained his first team place under new boss Billy Dougall, and bagged 14 goals in 42 games in the 1957\u201358 season. However Dougall was replaced by Harry Potts, who favoured up and coming youngster Jimmy Robson ahead of Cheesebrough, limiting him to seven goals and 18 appearances in 1958\u201359.
