Smith was born in Leicester. He was the younger son of John Bardell Smith (1876\u20131950), a mechanical engineer, and Ada (n\u00e9e Horrocks; 1876\u20131969). He was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys until 1929, when the family moved to London. His education continued at Bec School, Tooting, for three years, then at University College School, London. In 1935, although having failed his Higher School Certificate, he was awarded an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in the Mathematical Tripos, with a First in Part II in 1937 and a Distinction in Part III in 1938. Following graduation he began postgraduate research, taking his PhD in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. D.
