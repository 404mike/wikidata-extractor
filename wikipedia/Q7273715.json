Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1977, pgs. 40, 55.", "Nietzsche is not a hedonist, arguing that any passions in excess can \"drag their victim down with the weight of their folly.\" However, he maintains that it is possible for the passions to ultimately become \"spiritualized.\" Christianity, he criticizes, instead deals with immoderate passions by attempting to remove the passion completely. In an analogy, Nietzsche claims that the Christian approach to morality is not much different than how an unskilled dentist might treat any tooth pain by removing the tooth entirely rather than pursue other less aggressive and equally effective treatments. Christianity doesn't attempt to \"spiritualize, beautify, deify a desire,\" which leads Nietzsche to conclude that the Christian Church is \"hostile to life.\" Taking a psychological turn, Nietzsche writes that people who want to exterminate certain passions outright do so mainly because they are \"too weak-willed, too degenerate to impose moderation\" upon their own selves.Nietzsche, Friedrich.

New York: Penguin Books; 2003. p. 52", "Nietzsche concludes that insisting people ought to be one way and not another leads to a form of bigotry that devalues the goodness of human diversity, the \"enchanting wealth of types.\" Also, the belief that people can truly change their nature disregards the fact that any person is a \"piece of fate.\" It is not possible for a person to divorce him- or herself from either the past events or present circumstances that cause them to be who they are. Ultimately, Nietzsche concludes that it is \"immoralists\" such as himself who have the highest respect for inherent worth of individuals because they do not value one person's approach to life over any others.Nietzsche, Friedrich. Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ.: trans. R. J. Hollingdale. New York: Penguin Books; 2003. p. 56-57", "Nietzsche also attributes this decline in the German intellect to problems he saw in higher education in his day. First, Nietzsche calls into question the qualifications of college instructors, insisting on the need for \"educators who are themselves educated.\" Educators, he argues, are vital to teach three key skills: seeing (the ability to think before acting on impulse), thinking (\"Thinking has to be learned in the way dancing has to be learned.\"), and speaking and writing (\"One has to be able to dance with the pen.\"). Second, he is highly critical of opening colleges and universities to all classes of society, because when stripped of its \"privilege,\" the quality of higher education declines. \"All higher education belongs to the exceptions alone: one must be privileged to have a right to so high a privilege.
