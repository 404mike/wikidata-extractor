He trained under the Huguenot James Basire the younger (1769\u20131822) before spending several years in Rome, where he came to know J. M. W. Turner, Frederick Catherwood and Bertel Thorvaldsen. While in Rome he made some excellent copies of celebrated pictures, and acquired great facility as a draughtsman.\n\nOn his return to England, about 1834, he devoted himself to engraving, and became one of the leading workers in mezzotint and the mixed method. His plates, which are all from pictures by popular English painters of the day, include 'The Meeting of the Council of the Anti-Corn Law League,' after J. R. Herbert; 'Heather Belles,' after John Phillip; 'The Council of War in the Crimea,' after Augustus Egg; 'The Gentle Warning,' after Frank Stone; 'The Heart's Resolve,' and 'The Momentous Question,' after Sarah Setchell; 'Milton composing \"Samson Agonistes,\"' after J. C. Horsley; 'Opening of the Great Exhibition of 1851,' after H. C. Selous; 'Salutation to the Aged Friars,' after C. L. Eastlake; 'Dr. Johnson's Visit to Garrick,' after E. M. Ward; and portraits of Albert, Prince Consort, Lord John Russell, and the M.P. Joseph Hume. He produced his last plate in 1870, when he retired from the profession. Bellin drew and etched on three plates a panoramic view of Rome from Monte Pincio, which he published, with a dedication to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, in 1835. He was an original member of the Graphic Society. He died at his house in Regent's Park Road, London, on 29 April 1893.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Henry Corbould", "response": ["*My Chickens for Sale (1847), Maid of the Mill (1849), and Valentine's Eve (1850) (mezzotints by Samuel Bellin); "]}, {"page": "Henry Tidey", "response": ["In 1839 Tidey sent a portrait in watercolours to the exhibition of the Royal Academy, where he continued to exhibit mainly portraits until 1861. Occasionally he painted genre pictures in oil.Among them were The Union and The Repeal of the Union, which were engraved by Samuel Bellin; Fair-Time in the Park, Greenwich, Sunshine and Shade, and Sea Weeds, a picture of a band of Irish girls dancing on the sea-shore, which appeared at the Royal Academy in 1856. In 1855 he exhibited there for the first time a watercolour drawing, of Lieutenant-colonel Pakenham at the battle of the Alma. He then concentrated on history painting, and poetical subjects, somewhat after the manner of Watteau."]}, {"page": "Sarah Setchel", "response": ["Fanny, Setchel's first exhibited work, appeared at the Royal Academy in 1831, and she continued to exhibit there and at the Society of British Artists until 1840, when she sent to the Society A Scene from Howitt's Rural Life of England. She was elected in 1841 a member of the New Society of Painters in Water-colours, and in the following year contributed to its exhibition A Scene from \"Smugglers and Poachers\" in Crabbe's Tales of the Hall, representing a prison interior where a young man whose life is in jeopardy is visited by his betrothed. It became popular, and was engraved in mezzotint by Samuel Bellin as The Momentous Question. The Heart's Resolve, a subject from George Crabbe's tale of Jesse and Colin, exhibited in 1850, was engraved by Bellin as a companion plate."]}, {"page": "Bellin", "response": ["*Samuel Bellin (1799-1893), English printmaker and engraver"]}, {"page": "Elliot Stock", "response": ["His father was wealthy but died when Elliot was in his infancy. After education at Amersham Grammar School, Elliot Stock first worked for the firm of Piper, Stephenson, and Spence and then in 1857 became an apprentice to Mr. B. L. Green, a book-seller at 62, Paternoster Row. In 1859 Stock acquired the business. B. L. Green was the brother of Dr. Green of the Religious Tract Society. In its early years, the firm of Elliot Stock was primarily engaged in publishing religious works. In 1866 Stock married Fanny Bellin, the daughter of Samuel Bellin, an artist and engraver. Stock became an amateur painter and poet and acquired many artistic and literary friends and acquaintances. He was also a bird-watcher and athlete (winning a silver cup in rowing). In 1877 Stock published facsimile first editions of The Pilgrim's Progress, The Compleat Angler and George Herbert's The Temple. Every effort was made to recreate the actual type, paper, and binding of the original works in these facsimiles.McKitterick, D. (2013). Old books, new technologies: The representation, conservation and transformation of books since 1700. Stock's firm published many other notable facsimile first editions, such as those for Robinson Crusoe, Rasselas and The Vicar of Wakefield. The Antiquary was published by the Elliot Stock company from December 1879 to 1915. The monthly Book-Prices Current was started in 1887 by the firm of Elliot Stock and became a standard reference for book dealers and collectors."]}]}}
