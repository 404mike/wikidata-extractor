He also bought a good mouth organ at this time, intending it to be for his son, but liked it so much he kept it himself. He also refined his mouth organ technique after hearing Larry Adler's playing, and mostly played mouth organ subsequently. In 1974 he was one of the artists recorded by Topic, playing mouth organ, on Bonny North Tyne - Northumbrian Country Music. In later life, he recorded many times, chiefly with producer Geoff Heslop. The first release, with his friends Joe Hutton (piper) and Willy Taylor, collectively known as The Shepherds, was Harthope Burn, next came a compilation of Northumbrian Music and Poetry, From Sewingshields to Glendale (with Kathryn Tickell, Alistair Anderson, Mike Tickell, Hutton and Atkinson, etc.) and in 1989 Heslop and Alistair Anderson recorded him in a solo album called simply Will Atkinson - Mouthorgan. This included tunes from various sources, including five of his own compositions. Several recordings of him playing at folk clubs are available on the FARNE archive. When compiling the multi-album anthology The Voice of the People, Reg Hall selected several recordings of Will, which appeared on the record Ranting and Reeling - these included some of the recordings made for Bonny North Tyne, as well as later recordings made with The Shepherds."]}, {"page": "Hedgehog Pie", "response": ["The self-titled first album (1975) owed something to Jethro Tull (in Doonan's flute), Fairport Convention (the heavily strummed guitars), but, perhaps unsurprisingly for an album co-produced by Geoff Heslop and Steeleye Span's Rick Kemp, it owed most to the early work of that band in the use of heavy plucked bass, no drums and Margi Luckley's vocals which closely resembled those of Maddy Prior. It contained a mix of instrumentals and ballads, including 'Marriners' and 'Jack Orion'. The album was a critical success, if not a commercial one, and they gained a growing reputation as live performers, both as a headline band and supporting acts such as Richard Thompson, Mike Harding and John Martyn. Their reputation was aided by the release of the instrumental 'Drops of Brandy' on the important compilation The Electric Muse (1975)."]}, {"page": "Redesdale Studios", "response": ["Redesdale Studios was a Northumberland recording studio founded in 1996. It was situated in Elsdon in North Northumberland. It began as a partnership between Rubber and Black Crow Records manager Geoff Heslop, Scottish singer and songwriter Dick Gaughan, and the two partners in CM records, Dave Bulmer and Neil Sharpley. In the years between 1986 and 1995 it was the main studio in the county, recording many albums for its own labels, Black Crow Records, Acoustic Radio, Delta and Rede, as well for other labels.

Together with the fiddler Willy Taylor, and Will Atkinson (musician) on moothie (mouth organ), they performed as The Shepherds, making a recording Harthope Burn MWM Records 1031 (1983); both records were produced by Geoff Heslop.
