Rex Pierson from Norfolk, was the main designer for Vickers until the 1950s, designing the Vickers Vimy (which crossed the Atlantic in June 1919) to the Vickers Viscount, both pioneering aircraft. From 1945 to 1992, Rolls-Royce designed and built its helicopter (turboshaft) engines at its Small Engine Division at Leavesden, now a film set, these engines are now built by Rolls-Royce Turbomeca (from 1966). Britain's first satellite constructed in the UK \u2013 Ariel 3 (originally titled UK-3) \u2013 was built at BAC's Guided Weapon Division in Stevenage in the mid-1960s, later launched in May 1967. The Europa (rocket) was initially mostly British-led by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics at Stevenage and test-fired at Woomera Test Range in Australia, but later the subsequent Ariane (rocket family) would be mostly French-built and launched at Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana; Arianespace is 64% French and 20% German by ownership, and has no British share of ownership. The Rapier (missile) was developed by BAC (guided weapons division) at Stevenage (former English Electric)."]}, {"page": "Vickers Wellington", "response": ["The Vickers Wellington was a British twin-engined, long-range medium bomber. It was designed during the mid-1930s at Brooklands in Weybridge, Surrey. Led by Vickers-Armstrongs' chief designer Rex Pierson; a key feature of the aircraft is its geodetic airframe fuselage structure, which was principally designed by Barnes Wallis. Development had been started in response to Air Ministry Specification B.9/32, issued in the middle of 1932, for a bomber for the Royal Air Force.", "In October 1932, the British Air Ministry invited Vickers to tender for the recently issued Specification B.9/32, which sought a twin-engine medium daylight bomber. In response, Vickers conducted a design study, led by Chief Designer Rex Pierson. Early on, Vickers' chief structures designer Barnes Wallis proposed the use of a geodetic airframe, inspired by his previous work on airships and the single-engined Wellesley light bomber.Andrews 1967, p. 3. During structural testing performed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, the proposed structure demonstrated not only the required strength factor of six, but reached 11 without any sign of failure, proving the geodesic airframe to possess a strength far in excess of normal levels. This strength allowed for the structure design to be further developed to reduce the size of individual members and adopt simplified standard sections of lighter construction."]}, {"page": "Brooklands", "response": ["After the bombing of Brooklands in September 1940, the Vickers-Armstrongs Design Department (including Rex Pierson, Barnes Wallis and several hundred others) was dispersed to a secret location at the nearby Burhill Golf Course, just east of St George's Hill in Hersham and the Experimental Department led by George Edwards was relocated to temporary premises at Foxwarren in Redhill Road, Cobham. These two facilities played a crucial part in the successful development of the 'Upkeep' mine - better known today as the 'bouncing bomb' conceived by Barnes Wallis and deployed to such devastating effect by the 'Dambuster' Avro Lancasters of 617 Squadron, RAF, led by Guy Gibson against Germany's Ruhr Valley reservoirs on the night of 16\u201317 May 1943.", "*Rex Pierson (aircraft designer and engineer)"]}, {"page": "Barnes Wallis", "response": ["By the time of the R101 crash, Wallis had moved to the Vickers aircraft factory at the Brooklands motor circuit and aerodrome between Byfleet and Weybridge in Surrey.

During discussions between the committee and Vickers' chief designer, Rex Pierson, Vickers advocated turboprop power. The committee was not convinced and split the specification into two types, the Type IIA using piston power, which led to the Airspeed Ambassador, and the turboprop-powered Type IIB which Vickers was selected to develop in April 1945.Taylor Air Enthusiast August\u2013November 1984, p. 1.

An order for two prototypes was placed in March 1946, and construction started in the company's Foxwarren Experimental Department. Originally Viceroy after the viceroy of India, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the aircraft was renamed Viscount following India's independence in 1947.Pigott 2005, p. 125. There was work on replacing the Darts with the Mamba, but this was dropped by the time the prototypes were reaching completion.

With twice the power of Vickers' single-engined pusher Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus, which, while possessing effective armament was too slow, the E.F.B.8 was hoped to have adequate performance.Bruce 1957, p. 669. Like the E.F.B.7, the E.F.B.8 was a two-bay biplane with a steel-tube structure with plywood-and-fabric covering, being powered by two tractor Gnome Monosoupape rotary engines mounted between the wings. It was, however, much more compact, with a wingspan  less and 500\u00a0lb (230\u00a0kg) lighter. The gunner, armed with a single Lewis gun was sat in the nose, while the pilot again like the E.F.B.7. sat under the trailing edge of the wings, remote from the gunner, hindering cooperation between them in battle.Mason 1992, pp. 47\u201348.Bruce 1957, pp. 669\u2013670."]}, {"page": "Vickers E.S.1", "response": ["In late 1914, Harold Barnwell, chief test pilot with Vickers Limited, designed a single-seat \"scout\" or fast reconnaissance aircraft, and had it built without the knowledge or approval of his employers, \"borrowing\" a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine from Vickers' stores to power the aircraft. Barnwell attempted a first flight of his design, named the \"Barnwell Bullet\" in early 1915, but the aircraft crashed and was wrecked, possibly due to a miscalculated centre of gravity.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 60.Bruce 1969, p. 86.
