While forcefully driving out the British group, two of the English officers were shot to death and some were injured. This act was an open declaration of rebellion against the British.

The district commandant doubted this intelligence which came from a Natal native and was passed on by a farmer acting in a temporary capacity as a stand-in for a Border Guard officer.  The district commandant gathered his Border Guard on the Natal side of the river to counter the threat but a reconnaissance party concluded that the informant had mistaken men of Chelmsford's 3rd Regiment of NNC for Zulu forces.  They later assisted the men of the 2nd NNC under Harcourt Mortimer Bengough to cross the river.  Bengough's battalion withdrew after learning of the British defeat and together with the Border Guard took steps to defend Natal."]}]}}
