He later spent time that season on loan at League One club Notts County, scoring twice in eight appearances. At the end of the season, Ince turned down a new contract and moved to Blackpool, who had just been relegated from the Premier League. In two-and-a-half seasons at Blackpool, Ince played 113 games in all competitions and scored 33 goals. He also won the 2013 Football League Young Player of the Year Award and was named in the 2012\u201313 PFA Team of the Year.\nIn January 2014, he signed on loan for Premier League club Crystal Palace, for whom he scored his first Premier League goal, and returned to the division permanently at the end of the season, joining Hull City on a free transfer. Ince did not feature regularly for Hull in the 2014\u201315 season, spending time on loan at the end of 2014 with Nottingham Forest before returning briefly to Hull. A loan spell at the end of the season with Derby County was a success, with Ince scoring 11 goals in 18 appearances. At the end of the season, he joined Derby for a fee of \u00a34.75 million, briefly becoming the club's most-expensive signing. Ince spent the 2017\u201318 season with Huddersfield Town before joining Stoke City in July 2018 for a fee of \u00a310 million. In January 2022, he was part of a swap loan with Reading's Liam Moore. \nInce has been capped internationally for England at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Chopra", "response": ["Though he was close to signing with Barnsley, Chopra signed for Blackpool in July 2013.
