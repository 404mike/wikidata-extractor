However he failed to resolve major international disputed because of pressure from powerful League members. He later became British ambassador to Rome (1933\u20131939) and then the chief adviser on foreign publicity in the Ministry of Information (1939\u20131940). In 1946, he became deputy leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords.", "link_mentions": []}}
