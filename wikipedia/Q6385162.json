Vinicombe is a British ornithologist and writer on bird identification.\nVinicombe is best known for his first book, the Macmillan Field Guide to Bird Identification. Subsequent publications include Rare Birds in Britain and Ireland - a photographic record, co-authored with David Cottridge, in which Vinicombe set out to explain theories about bird vagrancy in Britain and western Europe, including reverse migration. He is identification consultant to Birdwatch magazine, and has written extensively on bird identification in Birdwatch, and other British journals, including Birding World and British Birds.\nHe has served on both the British Birds Rarities Committee and the British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee. His regular birding patch is Chew Valley Lake, where he has found numerous rare birds. Elsewhere in Avon, he is responsible for finding nine county firsts. Elsewhere in Britain, his finds include Britain's second ring-billed gull and the first lesser scaup and Blyth's reed warbler for the Isles of Scilly. He was also among the observers who confirmed the identification of Britain's only Mediterranean short-toed lark, at Portland Bill in 1992.\nVinicombe has also studied the status of vagrant wildfowl in Britain and northwest Europe, in particular that of ruddy shelduck and white-headed duck. A paper on the former species (co-authored with Andrew Harrop) was published in British Birds in 1999.Vinicombe and the bird artist Laurel Tucker were personal and professional partners for a period during the 1980s, until Tucker's death in 1986.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reverse migration (birds)", "response": ["If a bird sets off in the opposite direction, shown by the orange arrow, it will end up in Western Europe instead of South East Asia. This is a mechanism that might lead to birds such as Pallas's Warblers turning up thousands of kilometres from where they should be. Keith Vinicombe suggested that birds from east of Lake Baikal in Siberia (circled) could not occur in western Europe because the migration routes were too north\u2013south. Most of these lost young birds perish in unsuitable wintering grounds, but there is some evidence that a few survive, and either re-orient in successive winters, or even return to the same area."]}, {"page": "Red-necked nightjar", "response": ["The species has occurred as a vagrant twice in northern Europe, in Northumberland, Britain in October 1856,Melling, Tim (2009) Should Red-necked Nightjar be on the British List?

In the light of the rejection of a record of Blyth's reed warbler in Shetland in 1997, Vinicombe and Pennington wrote to British Birds to question the decision. They suggested that the committee was becoming too focussed on minutiae in assessing bird descriptions, ignoring more obvious evidence, Vinicombe saying that \"the Committee has prevaricated to the point where it 'cannot see the wood for the trees'\".Vinicombe, Keith (2001) The Unst Blyth's Reed Warbler British Birds 94(6): 291\u201393; Pennington, Mike (2001) The Unst Blyth's Reed Warbler British Birds 94(6): 293\u201394 David Walker and Owen Leyshon, David Ferguson, and Andrew Duff have criticised the committee on similar grounds in relation to its approach to the assessment of rare seabirds, citing the Dungeness herald petrel claim as an example.
