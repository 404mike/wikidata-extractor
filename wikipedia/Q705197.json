He is known for his deep interest for the nature and use of classical metres. The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry describes his verse as \"strongly anti-romantic, disenchanted and usually satirical\". Interviewed by Robert Potts, he described his work as a combination of \"painstaking care\" and \"misanthropy\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 27", "response": ["*1946 \u2013 Peter Reading, English poet and author (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Peter Reading (1946\u20132011), English poet"]}, {"page": "English poetry", "response": ["There has been recent activity focused on poets in Bloodaxe Books' The New Poetry, including Simon Armitage, Kathleen Jamie, Glyn Maxwell, Selima Hill, Maggie Hannan, Michael Hofmann and Peter Reading.
