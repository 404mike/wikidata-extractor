Virtually blind in one eye, an operation at 14 on the day the National Health Service NHS was founded (5 July 1948) saved his eyesight. He began to work for a local paper, the Luton Gazette, after leaving school. Briefly working for the nationals while still having the day job in Luton, he managed to gain a regular job at the Daily Sketch after finding details of the 21st birthday party of a son of the Aga Khan at the Savoy Hotel.Shand was later a journalist for the Daily Mail and Daily Express, before moving into comedy writing in the 1960s. Shortly after being sacked from the Mail for being drunk once too often, he ran into the documentary maker Michael Ingrams, who eventually introduced him to Bernard Braden, for whom Shand first began to write humorous material.Shand worked extensively with David Frost, beginning with The Frost Programme in 1967. Subsequent work with Frost included ITV's coverage of Apollo 11 landing on the Moon in 1969, and spells in New York working on Frost's American talk show as a \"creative consultant\".His work with impressionist Mike Yarwood began around the same time with the sketch show Three of a Kind (1967). Shand also wrote for such acts as Spike Milligan, Kenny Everett, Bob Monkhouse, The Two Ronnies and Jasper Carrott (on Carrott Confidential). He was a member of BBC staff for many years.Shand married Judith Keppel in 1985; the marriage ended in 1987. He died on 14 April 2018, aged 84 in Whitton, North Lincolnshire, where he had lived since 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spike Milligan", "response": ["* In 1975 Milligan co-wrote (with Neil Shand) and co-starred in a BBC TV sitcom called The Melting Pot.

In addition to the main pool of writers involved in the show, a number of other writers also submitted various sketches to the show, including Paul Alexander, Simon Booker, Neil Shand, Paul Minett and Dick Vosburgh, the latter whom had previously worked with Everett on his show at Thames. The show was a ratings success for the BBC, repeatedly drawing audiences of around 12-13 million viewers per episode. When the show hit the screens in early 1982, it was lauded by critics; Hilary Kingsley from the Daily Mirror commented \"the first Kenny Everett show was tatty, tasteless and trivial. I loved it!.\" Everett was praised for his inventive comedy style that went against the norm for sketch shows; it was seen as zany, daring and unique, although at times the humour bordered on the grisly and squirm inducing. Towards the end of the show's run in 1987 the reception had changed, it was beginning to look tired and old fashioned as James Green commented in a review for The Stage in December 1987, with its formula of bawdy and surreal humour barely changing over the years. After Series 5 had ended in January 1988, Everett decided not to renew his contract with the BBC due to his growing disillusion with the filming of the show and faltering professional relations with his co-writers. Despite the BBC's intentions for the show to continue, it came to an abrupt end when Everett opted out from doing more shows."]}]}}
