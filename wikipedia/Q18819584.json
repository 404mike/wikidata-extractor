Franklin and Ashley-Smith were in charge; before the First World War started in 1914, Ashley-Smith was sure that the FANY had a useful role and she intended to find it. She and Franklin are credited with reinventing the FANY after the disagreement with the founders had been settled."]}, {"page": "Catharine Washington", "response": ["By 1916 the policy was changed and ambulances driven by women were welcomed.

Their ambulances consisted of converted private cars and dilapidated lorries."]}, {"page": "Mary Baxter Ellis", "response": ["The FANY would have been completely disbanded, but the organisation escaped this because they were all volunteers.
