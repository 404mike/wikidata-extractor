They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight. After Town were relegated in 1955\u201356, Beattie resigned as manager in November 1956, and Bill Shankly succeeded him.

The team did so with a majority of their team being made up of Scottish players (the Scotch Professors). In a contribution to Paul Agnew's 1989 biography of Tom Finney, the player himself wrote: \"The club has long been known as Proud Preston, and the Old Invincibles of the previous century set some incredible standards\".Agnew, p. 55. The author wrote elsewhere: \"...and that team became immortalised as the 'Old Invincibles'\".Agnew, p. 53. Other sources call the team \"The Invincibles\" and both versions of the nickname have been used. In his autobiography, Finney wrote: \"The championship stayed with North End \u2014 by now tagged the Old Invincibles \u2014 the following year, but runners-up spot had to suffice for the next three seasons\". As Finney said, Preston were league champions again in 1889\u201390, but have not won the title since. In total, they have been league runners-up six times, including the three consecutive seasons from 1890 to 1891 to 1892\u201393, and twice in the 1950s when Finney was playing. The club's last major trophy win was in the 1938 FA Cup Final when they defeated Huddersfield Town 1\u20130 and the team included Bill Shankly, Andy Beattie and goalscorer George Mutch."]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Andy Beattie"]}, {"page": "Stockport County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Andy Beattie"]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team", "response": ["The same qualification rules were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1954 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group.

The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads. Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied by their wives. Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals, which prompted the team manager Andy Beattie to resign hours before the game against Uruguay.Andrew Ward, \"Scotland: The Team\" (The Breedon Book Publishing Company Limited, Derby, 1987), page 60.
