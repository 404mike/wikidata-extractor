Evans was a member of the City of Elizabeth council from 1975\u201384 and served as Mayor from 1981\u201384.Evans entered the South Australian House of Assembly following the 1984 Elizabeth by-election, caused when Peter Duncan resigned from the seat to contest the federal seat of Makin. Elected as a Labor independent, he served as Minister of Health, Family and Community Services and Minister for the Aged from 1992\u201393, and rejoined Labor from 1993.\nEvans moved from state to federal politics in 1994. He was Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1994 to October 2004, representing the Division of Bonython, South Australia.  A 1994 Elizabeth by-election was sparked when Evans resigned to contest the 1994 Bonython by-election. Evans was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1996 to 2001.\nThe Division of Bonython was abolished at the 2003 electoral redistribution. Evans contested the Division of Wakefield at the 2004 election, which had absorbed most of Bonython's former territory and had become notionally Labor as a result. However, he was narrowly defeated by less than one percent.\nEvans took up the position of Director, Community Engagement at The University of Adelaide in July 2007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 2001\u20132004", "response": ["| Hon Martyn Evans"]}, {"page": "2004 Australian federal election", "response": ["| Martyn Evans*", "* *Con Sciacca was in fact the member for the seat of Bowman, which had become Liberal in a redistribution; he instead contested the new seat of Bonner.

Bannon's government was easily re-elected at the 1985 election, achieving a 2.2 percent two-party swing towards them from the Liberal opposition and a four-seat majority. However, the economy experienced another downturn in the late 80s/early 90s recession, and Bannon paid the price at the 1989 election, when the ALP won only 48 percent of the two-party vote: a swing of 5.2 percent against it. Both major parties won 22 seats each in the hung parliament, two short of a majority. Labor was able to form minority government with the confidence and supply support of the two Labor independent MPs, Martyn Evans and Norm Peterson. Peterson became Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly following the election. Shortly thereafter, electoral legislation was passed with the objective that the party which receives over 50 percent of the statewide two-party vote at the forthcoming election should win the two-party vote in a majority of seats, through a compulsory strategic redrawing of electoral boundaries before each election, making South Australia the only state to do so. One element of the Playmander remains to this day which contributes to the above: the change from multi-member to single-member seats. It was only the second time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a third term (the first time was when Dunstan won in 1977). In April 1988, Bannon was elected Federal President of the Labor Party.The Canberra Times, 7 April 1988 He held that position until June 1991."]}, {"page": "Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1998\u20132001", "response": ["| Hon Martyn Evans"]}, {"page": "Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1996\u20131998", "response": ["| Hon Martyn Evans"]}, {"page": "David Fawcett", "response": ["The previous Liberal member, Neil Andrew, believed this made Wakefield unwinnable and opted not to recontest the seat in 2004.
