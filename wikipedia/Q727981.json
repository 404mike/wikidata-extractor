He was first elected at the 2010 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dartford, winning the seat from Labour. He has been supportive of Leave Means Leave, a Eurosceptic pressure group. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dartford Crossing", "response": [" The announcement was unpopular with local residents, who encouraged drivers to sound their horns in protest when using the crossing.  After the change of government following the 2010 general election, the new prime minister David Cameron announced that the crossing might still be sold, despite local opposition, particularly from Gareth Johnson, Member of Parliament (MP) for Dartford. Subsequently, the chancellor George Osborne announced that charges would be increased instead to cover the budget deficit. Pre-pay accounts for the crossing were introduced around this time; drivers held an electronic device called a DART-Tag in the vehicle that automatically deducted the charge at payment booths. This was abolished when the Dart Charge was introduced in 2014.", "At busy times there was significant delay at the payment booths when these existed. Because there are numerous junctions on either side of the crossing, a high proportion of local traffic mixes with long-distance traffic, for example travelling from the North and Midlands onwards to Continental Europe. In 2004, a BBC survey reported that the crossing was \"the most stressful section of the M25\" while in 2009, the crossing was listed in a Royal Automobile Club report as the fourth most congested road in Britain. Though Highways England have reported greatly improved journey times since automatic charging was introduced, local MP Gareth Johnson claims otherwise and has insisted that the Lower Thames Crossing, along with improved signing around Dartford, are better options to reduce congestion. In 2015, he said the crossing was Britain's worst stretch of motorway. There are agreed plans to create another crossing of the Thames in the East of London to ease congestion at the Dartford Crossing."]}, {"page": "Borough of Dartford", "response": ["Since 2010, the Dartford constituency's Member of Parliament (MP) is Gareth Johnson (Conservative) who replaced the outgoing Howard Stoate (Labour)."]}, {"page": "A Dance to the Music of Time", "response": ["| Nicholas Jenkins || James Purefoy  John Standing || Tom McHugh  Alex Jennings ||  Gareth Johnson, Noel Johnson"]}, {"page": "Longfield", "response": ["Dr Howard Stoate (Labour), who had been the MP since 1997, decided not to stand again as a candidate at the 2010 general election. \"MP to quit over second job rules\" His successor candidate was defeated by Gareth Johnson (Conservative) at that election."]}, {"page": "Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Dartford is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Gareth Johnson of the Conservative Party.
