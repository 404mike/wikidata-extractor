In 2003, she was selected as one of the \"Best of Young British Novelists\" by Granta magazine based on her unpublished manuscript; her debut novel, Brick Lane, was published later that year. It was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It was adapted as a 2007 film of the same name. She has also published three other novels. Her forthcoming novel, Love Marriage will be published by Virago Press in February 2022.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["In the early years, Diana was often noted for her shy nature. Journalist Michael White perceived her as being \"smart\", \"shrewd and funny\". Those who communicated with her closely describe her as a person who was led by \"her heart\". In an article for The Guardian, Monica Ali described Diana as a woman with a strong character, who entered the royal family as an inexperienced girl and, despite being uneducated, she could handle their expectations and overcome the difficulties and sufferings of her marital life. Ali also believed that she \"had a lasting influence on the public discourse, particularly in matters of mental health\" by discussing her eating disorder publicly. According to Tina Brown, in her early years Diana possessed a \"passive power\", a quality that in her opinion she shared with the Queen Mother and a trait that would enable her to instinctively use her appeal to achieve her goals. Brown also believed that Diana was capable of charming people with a single glance.", "In an article written for The Independent in 1998, journalist Yvonne Roberts observed the sudden change in people's opinion of Diana after her death from critical to complimentary, a viewpoint supported by Theodore Dalrymple who also noticed the \"sudden shift from cruel personal abuse to absurdly exaggerated respect\". Roberts also questioned whether she had achieved anything different from other members of the royal family and added that Diana was neither \"a saint\" nor \"a revolutionary\" figure, but \"may have encouraged some people\" to tackle issues such as landmines, AIDS and leprosy. While analysing the impact of Diana's death and her extraordinary popularity from a gendered point of view, British historian Ludmilla Jordanova said: \"To be an ideal, to be living for and on behalf of others is a terrible burden; it makes impossible, irreconcilable emotional demands \u2013 no human being can survive the complex forces that impact upon charismatic women.\" Jordanova also observed that \"Diana herself was not anti-establishment\" and that is \"Better to remember her by trying to decipher how emotions overshadow analysis and why women are the safeguards of humanitarian feelings.\" Author Anne Applebaum believed that Diana has not had any impact on public opinions posthumously; an idea supported by Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian who also wrote in his article that Diana's memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death, while Peter Conrad, another Guardian contributor, argued that even in \"a decade after her death, she is still not silent\", and Allan Massie of The Telegraph described Diana as \"the celebrity of celebrities\" whose sentiments \"continue to shape our society\". Writing for The Guardian, Monica Ali described Diana as \"a one-off, fascinating and flawed. Her legacy might be mixed, but it's not insubstantial. Her life was brief, but she left her mark\"."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["|Monica Ali || Brick Lane || Doubleday"]}, {"page": "Whitechapel", "response": ["Brick Lane, the 2003 novel by Monica Ali is based in Whitechapel and documents the life of a young Bangladeshi woman's experience of living in Tower Hamlets in the 1990s and early 2000s."]}, {"page": "Wadham College, Oxford", "response": ["Among recent members have been Dr Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Dyson, former justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and Master of the Rolls, author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, writer and journalist Jonathan Freedland, novelists Hari Kunzru and Monica Ali, and Wasim Sajjad, former Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan and twice President of Pakistan.
