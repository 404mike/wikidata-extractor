In a negative review of the book, British scholar Simon Goldhill said it was of little value as history and criticized Mayer for his political bias, arguing that Mayer ignored Arab acts and media rhetoric against Jewish settlers and Israelis, falsely portrayed the Six-Day War in 1967 as a \"calculated imperialist plot\", claimed that all Western criticism of the Islamic world for human rights issues is nothing more than self-interested, and described Arab feeling toward Jews buying property in Palestine in the 1920s as \"righteous anger\"."]}, {"page": "Richard A.

The novel seems to give vent to Fienburgh's deepseated concerns about corruption in politics. According to Michael Rush, in The Selection of Parliamentary Candidates (1969), Fienburgh claimed in 1955 that \"the Labour Party is the only party in Britain in which you can buy a seat\". One near-contemporary critic, Alan Lovell, writing in the New Left Review in 1961, considered No Love For Johnnie a \"bad novel\" and wrote that \"Fienburgh seems to have had no conception of what idealism means\". Derek Jewell, writing in 1967, called it \"a bitter study of political life\". Geoffrey Wheatcroft in The Observer in 2001 suggested that No Love for Johnnie was the archetype of a genre that he named \"the Labour Party novel of disillusionment\".

Just as Germans had been carefully taught to hate the Jews, to the point that they could readily torment and kill them, so had Catholics\"; that author Goldhagen \"sees a deep vein of Jew-hatred ingrained within Catholic tradition; and he does not think that there was any difference of kind, between that old religious Jew-hatred and the murderous racial antisemitism of the twentieth century\".", "Although A Moral Reckoning was favorably reviewed in The Spectator, Kirkus Reviews, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and given a generally favorable overview ahead of an interview in The Atlantic, it was also subject to substantial criticism, even among some of those reviewers who found aspects of the work praiseworthy.
