He was on the books of Manchester United, but returned to junior football in Merthyr Tydfil without playing for United's first team.

He made his debut in the Second Division on 8 January 1910 playing at right back in a 1\u20131 draw away to Oldham Athletic, and played in six of the last eight games of the 1909\u201310 season.
