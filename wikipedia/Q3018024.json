He took part in the excavation of many important sites in Maltese prehistory, including the Skorba Temples and Xag\u0127ra Stone Circle . From 1958-1963, he was a curator at the National Museum of Archaeology, Malta. He retired in 1997.

When the eminent Maltese historian Sir Temi \u017bammit excavated the nearby temples of Ta' \u0126a\u0121rat, only a single upright slab protruded from a small mound of debris on the Skorba site.  Although it was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, archeologists ignored this mound until David H.

It takes its name from a locality in the municipality of Mara, province of Sassari, where the cave of Sa de Ucca of Tintirriolu (the mouth of the bat) is located. The first Bonu Ighinu pottery was discovered here by Renato Loria and David H.

He also painted views of the Grand Harbour and the Three Cities. Brocktorff also painted scenes of rural locations, including the megalithic remains at \u0120gantija and the Xag\u0127ra Stone Circle in Gozo. The paintings of the latter are significant since they accurately depict the site before it was deliberately partially destroyed in the 1830s, and in 1972 the archaeologist David H. Trump gave the site its alternative name Brocktorff Circle after the artist."]}]}}
