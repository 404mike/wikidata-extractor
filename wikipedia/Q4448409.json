His lifelong passion for puzzles and ciphers stood him in good stead in his wartime service in British Intelligence (1944\u201347). After the war he read Modern Languages at Cambridge (French and German), 1947\u201350; upon graduation he entered the Civil Service. In 1952 he married Enid Tidmarsh (died 2002), a pianist.

According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar Eric Sams, Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of mercury poisoning; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were a result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a \"gelatinous\" tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a colloid cyst, a craniopharyngioma, a chordoma, or a chordoid meningioma. In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported. It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder; bipolar type,Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, \"Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?\", Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562 or bipolar disorder and bipolar II disorder.
