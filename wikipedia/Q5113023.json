He was involved in a very wide range of projects and his output was prodigious.  He came to be regarded as one of the finest symphonic orchestrators of his generation.  He was dedicated to the conservation, recording and promotion of classic film scores by composers such as Bernard Herrmann, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman, Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, Elmer Bernstein and others.   He wrote full biographies as well as sleeve notes, radio scripts, reviews and articles, on composers such as Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Karol Szymanowski, Arthur Bliss, George Dyson, Herbert Howells, Maurice Ravel, Nikolai Tcherepnin and others.\nHe arranged music from the film scores and other music of William Walton, Malcolm Arnold, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Ernest Bloch.  Artists who have performed his work include Jos\u00e9 Carreras, James Galway, Julian Lloyd Webber, and Jill Gomez. Outside the area of music, he put together anthologies of the prose of Arthur Machen and James Farrar. He died of an AIDS-related disease at the age of 48.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Impressionism in music", "response": ["Other composers linked to Impressionism include Lili Boulanger, By Sylvia Typaldos, Nocturne for violin (or flute) & piano By Sylvia Typaldos, Pie Jesu for mezzo-soprano, string quartet, harp & organ Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, Frederick Delius, Paul Dukas, Alexander Scriabin,Christopher Palmer, Impressionism in Music (London: Hutchinson; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973): 208.

The Big Sleep, Mildred Pierce, and The Letter were his best film noir scores of the 1940s. The Letter is set in Singapore, the tale of murder begins with the loud main musical theme during the credits, which sets the tense and violent mood of the film. The main theme characterizes Leslie, the main character, by her tragic passion. The main theme is heard in the confrontation between Leslie and the murdered man's wife in the Chinese shop. Steiner portrays this scene through the jangling of wind chimes which crescendos as the wife emerges through opium smoke. The jangling continues until the wife asks Leslie to take off her shawl, after which the theme blasts indicating the breaking point of emotions of these women. Steiner's score for The Letter was nominated for the 1941 Academy Award for Best Original Score, losing to Walt Disney's Pinocchio. In the score for The Big Sleep, Steiner uses musical thematic characterization for the characters in the film. The theme for Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is beguiling and ironic, with a playful grace note at the end of the motif, portrayed mixed between major and minor. At the end of the film, his theme is played fully in major chords and finishes by abruptly ending the chord as the film terminates (this was an unusual film music practice in Hollywood at the time). According to Christopher Palmer, the love theme for Bogart's Philip and Lauren Bacall's Vivian is one of Steiner's strongest themes. Steiner uses the contrast of high strings and low strings and brass to emphasize Philip's feelings for Vivian opposed with the brutality of the criminal world.In 1947, Steiner scored a film noir Western, Pursued."]}, {"page": "Psycho (1960 film)", "response": ["Hitchcock insisted that Bernard Herrmann write the score for Psycho despite the composer's refusal to accept a reduced fee for the film's lower budget.

Bax published four piano sonatas (1910\u201332), which are, in Palmer's view, as central to the composer's piano music as the symphonies are to the orchestral output.Palmer, Christopher (1987). Notes to Chandos CD 8496, OCLC 602371238 The first two sonatas are each in a single movement, of about twenty minutes; the third and fourth are in conventional three-movement form. The First Symphony was originally planned as a large-scale piano sonata in E (1921); the manuscript score of the latter came to light in the early 1980s and was performed for the first time in 1983.Foreman, Lewis (1994). Notes to Continuum CD CCD 1045 DDD, OCLC 223356733        Bax's own virtuosity as a pianist is reflected in the demands of many of his piano pieces. Palmer cites Chopin and Liszt as major influences on Bax's piano style as well as Balakirev and the other Russians whose influence is seen throughout the composer's work. For piano duo Bax composed two tone poems, Moy Mell (1917) and Red Autumn (1931). His shorter piano pieces include picturesque miniatures such as In a Vodka Shop (1915), A Hill Tune (1920) and Water Music (1929)."]}, {"page": "Frederick Delius", "response": ["At Leipzig, Delius became a fervent disciple of Wagner, whose technique of continuous music he sought to master. An ability to construct long musical paragraphs is, according to the Delius scholar Christopher Palmer, Delius's lasting debt to Wagner, from whom he also acquired a knowledge of chromatic harmonic technique, \"an endlessly proliferating sensuousness of sound\".Palmer, pp. 95\u201396 Grieg, however, was perhaps the composer who influenced him more than any other. The Norwegian composer, like Delius, found his primary inspiration in nature and in folk-melodies, and was the stimulus for the Norwegian flavour that characterises much of Delius's early music.Palmer, pp. 46\u201350 The music writer Anthony Payne observes that Grieg's \"airy texture and non-developing use of chromaticism showed [Delius] how to lighten the Wagnerian load\". Early in his career Delius drew inspiration from Chopin, later from his own contemporaries Ravel and Richard Strauss,Fenby (1971), p. 82, Palmer, p. 98 and from the much younger Percy Grainger, who first brought the tune of Brigg Fair to Delius's notice.Palmer, pp. 89\u201390", "Delius's first orchestral compositions were, in Christopher Palmer's words, the work of \"an insipid if charming water-colourist\".Palmer, p. 5 The Florida Suite (1887, revised 1889) is \"an expertly crafted synthesis of Grieg and Negroid Americana\",Palmer, p. 7 while Delius's first opera Irmelin (1890\u201392) lacks any identifiably Delian passages. Its harmony and modulation are conventional, and the work bears the clear fingerprints of Wagner and Grieg. Payne asserts that none of the works prior to 1895 are of lasting interest. The first noticeable stylistic advance is evident in Koanga (1895\u201397), with richer chords and faster harmonic rhythms; here we find Delius \"feeling his way towards the vein that he was soon to tap so surely\". In Paris (1899), the orchestration owes a debt to Richard Strauss; its passages of quiet beauty, says Payne, nevertheless lack the deep personal involvement of the later works. Paris, the final work of Delius's apprentice years, is described by Foss as \"one of the most complete, if not the greatest, of Delius's musical paintings\"."]}, {"page": "Bernard Herrmann", "response": ["Herrmann's unused score for Torn Curtain was commercially recorded after his death, initially by Elmer Bernstein for his Film Music Collection subscription record label (reissued by Warner Bros.
