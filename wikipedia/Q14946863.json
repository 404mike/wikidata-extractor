These screens, which led to the researchers winning a Nobel Prize in 1995 along with developmental geneticist Edward B. Lewis, identified genes that control the segmentation pattern of the Drosophila embryos. The hh loss of function mutant phenotype causes the embryos to be covered with denticles, i.e. small pointy projections resembling the spikes of a hedgehog. Investigations aimed at finding a hedgehog equivalent in vertebrates by Philip Ingham, Andrew P. McMahon and Clifford Tabin revealed three homologous genes."]}, {"page": "Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby", "response": ["*Professor Philip Ingham FRS Developmental Geneticist, Toh Kian Chui Distinguished Professor, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore"]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Philip Ingham: Scientist"]}, {"page": "Trithorax-group proteins", "response": ["The founding member of TrxG proteins, trithorax (trx), was discovered ~1978 by Philip Ingham as part of his doctoral thesis while a graduate student in the laboratory of J.R.S.
