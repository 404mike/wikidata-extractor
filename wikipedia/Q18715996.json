McClure was a wealthy idealist who was one of the co-founders of the failed utopian settlement of New Harmony, Indiana. In his will, he ordered that his estate be sold and the proceeds be used to fund the construction of libraries. His two siblings had already seized much of his estate, sold it, and made off with the funds. Hovey filed over sixty lawsuits to reclaim the assets of the estate, and use the proceeds for their intended purpose. The estate successfully funded the opening of 160 libraries in Indiana and Illinois. The case gained considerable press coverage around Indiana, and Hovey gained considerable popularity from his success.Gugin, p. 191 He met and married his wife Mary Ann in 1844, and the couple had five children. Only two of the children survived infancy."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1912 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|rowspan=3| William McClure"]}, {"page": "Shooting at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre pistol", "response": ["| 35 ||align=left| William McClure ||align=left|  || 411"]}, {"page": "Shooting at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 30 metre rapid fire pistol", "response": ["| 41 ||align=left| William McClure ||align=left|  || 23 || 180"]}, {"page": "McClure, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam McClure"]}, {"page": "North Carolina General Assembly of 1785", "response": ["* William McClure, Craven County, elected on December 10, 1785"]}]}}
