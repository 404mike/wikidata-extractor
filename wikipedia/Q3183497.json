Fly-half Michael Lynagh opened the scoring for Australia with a penalty in the 27th minute. They extended their lead before half-time when prop Tony Daly scored a try, which was converted by Lynagh. England scored two penalties in the second half, courtesy of full-back Jonathan Webb, but a further penalty by Lynagh sealed Australia's victory at 12\u20136. The tournament hosts reached the final again in 1995, as South Africa faced New Zealand in Johannesburg. Fly-half Andrew Mehrtens opened the scoring for New Zealand in the 6th minute after scoring a penalty. His opposite number, Joel Stransky, levelled the score five minutes later. The pair swapped successful penalty attempts before Stransky gave South Africa a 9\u20136 lead with a 32nd-minute drop goal just before half-time. New Zealand equalized in the 55th minute with a drop goal by Mehrtens, and as no further points were scored, the final went into extra time for the first time. Mehrtens converted a penalty to put New Zealand back the lead, but Stransky replied minutes later. With seven minutes to the end of extra time, Stransky scored a drop goal to secure a 15\u201312 victory for South Africa.

However, he was primarily a consistent place-kicker and not viewed as much of an attacking threat; after harsh criticism of England's dour forward-based tactics in their 1991 Grand Slam he was replaced by Jonathan Webb, previously considered less consistent with the boot, in both place-kicks and penalties, but was seen to be more adventurous with the ball in hand. Hodgkinson was however in the squad for the 1991 Rugby World Cup held in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and France: and played in the victorious team against United States of America. Hodgkinson scored 203 points in his 14 appearances, with a sole try coming against Argentina in Buenos Aires on tour in 1990. Although he might be considered unlucky to have lost his place when he did, injuries curtailed his subsequent career and he was never able to regain a place in the international team."]}, {"page": "List of Rugby World Cup try scorers", "response": ["*Jonathan Webb"]}, {"page": "1988 England rugby union tour of Australia and Fiji", "response": ["*Jonathan Webb (Bristol) 9 Caps"]}, {"page": "Jon Webb", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonathan Webb "]}, {"page": "Northern Football Club", "response": ["The last player capped at international level directly from Northern was Feidlim McLoughlin, who was selected to play for Ireland in 1977.
