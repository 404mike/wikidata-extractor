In 1968, she became the first black British woman Olympian. Her family were poor and she had to rely on charity to travel and obtain equipment. When she was 23 she had to retire to lack of money and facilities and she hid her trophies. When the Olympic torch passed through her area she was the only Olympic athlete and she was not asked to carry it. Only later was recognised for her contribution.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wellingborough", "response": ["* Anita Neil, First Black British female Olympian."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1972 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Anita Neil"]}, {"page": "1969 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Anita NeilDenise RamsdenSheila CooperVal Peat||44.39"]}, {"page": "List of European Athletics Championships medalists (women)", "response": ["|Anita NeillDenise RamsdenSheila CooperVal Peat"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Anita NeilMargaret CritchleyMadeleine CobbVal Peat ||44.28"]}, {"page": "List of 100 metres national champions (women)", "response": ["*1970: Anita Neil", "*1971: Anita Neil"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 100 metres", "response": ["| 3 ||align=left|Anita Neil || align=left|  || 8 || 11.55 ", "| 6 ||align=left|Anita Neil || align=left|  ||  2||  11.58"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay", "response": ["|\u2022 Andrea Lynch\u2022 Della Pascoe\u2022 Judy Vernon\u2022 Anita Neil   ", "|\u2022 Andrea Lynch\u2022 Della Pascoe\u2022 Judy Vernon\u2022 Anita Neil   "]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay", "response": ["|\u2022 Anita Neil\u2022 Maureen Tranter\u2022 Janet Simpson\u2022 Lillian Board   ", "|\u2022 Anita Neil\u2022 Maureen Tranter\u2022 Janet Simpson\u2022 Lillian Board   "]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 100 metres", "response": ["| 4 || align=left|Anita Neil || align=left| ||11.6 || ", "| 6 || align=left|Anita Neil || align=left| "]}, {"page": "Denise Ramsden (athlete)", "response": ["She won a bronze medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay, the team running 44.39 seconds for Great Britain and Northern Ireland Athletic team  in the 1969 European Athletics Championships in the Karaiskakis Stadium, Athens, Greece, the team was; Anita Neil, Denise Ramsden, Sheila Cooper, Val Peat (n\u00e9e Wild)."]}, {"page": "1967 European Cup (athletics)", "response": ["| Anita NeilMaureen TranterJenny PawseyDella James||45.3"]}, {"page": "1969 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's 100 metres", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"CC9966\"|Bronze|| Anita Neil  ", "|  || align=left | Anita Neil || align=left |  || 11.81 || ", "| 2 || align=left | Anita Neil || align=left |  || 11.7 || Q", "| 2 || align=left | Anita Neil || align=left |  || 11.9 || Q"]}, {"page": "1969 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"CC9966\"|Bronze|| Anita NeilDenise RamsdenSheila CooperVal Peat  ", "|   || align=left |  || align=left| Anita NeilDenise RamsdenSheila CooperVal Peat || 44.39 || ", "| 1  || align=left |  || align=left| Anita NeilDenise RamsdenSheila CooperVal Peat || 45.0 || Q"]}, {"page": "1971 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's 100 metres", "response": ["| 8 || align=left | Anita Neil || align=left |  || 11.75 || ", "| 4 || align=left | Anita Neil || align=left |  || 11.70 || Q", "| 2 || align=left | Anita Neil || align=left |  || 11.85 || Q"]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Games medallists in athletics (women)", "response": ["|1970||Pam RyanJenny LamyMarion HoffmanRaelene Boyle ||44.14||Anita NeilMargaret CritchleyMadeleine CobbVal Peat ||44.28||Joan HendryJoyce SadowickPatty LoverockStephanie Berto ||44.68"]}, {"page": "England at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Anita Neil\t         ||100m, relay||1 x silver"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's 100 metres", "response": ["| 2 || 4 ||align=left| Anita Neil ||align=left|  || 11.51 || Q", "| 4 || 1 ||align=left| Anita Neil ||align=left|  || 11.64 || Q", "| 6 || 3 ||align=left| Anita Neil ||align=left|  || 11.54 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay", "response": ["|  || align=left|  || align=left|Anita Neil, Margaret Critchley, Madeleine Cobb, Val Peat || 44.28 ||"]}, {"page": "Doris Neil", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anita Neil"]}, {"page": "List of British champions in 100 metres", "response": ["|Anita Neil", "|Anita Neil"]}]}}
