As a solo artist, he has released seven critically acclaimed albums, including a trilogy of work inspired by his childhood home, as well as themes of nature, people, place and time. His work combines field recordings with classical orchestration and contemporary electronic elements. Cooper also works across mixed media projects including installation art, theatre and film. He's a recipient of a Royal Television Society award and his music is played frequently on BBC Radio 3 & BBC Radio 6 Music as well as featured on various TV network productions.\nHe is credited with exploring the concept of psychogeography, connecting identity, memory, and place through music, words and cinematography. He explores these themes further by partnering with well-known artists and writers in his work and live shows.\nHe is widely known for burying the only existing copy of the master magnetic tape of his first classical album in Scotland, deleting all digital files and leaving only a treasure hunt of clues for fans and his record label alike to search for it. The tape has yet to be found.\nOriginally founding member of bands The Magnetic North and Erland and the Carnival with whom he has released five acclaimed albums, he has a diverse musical background. Cooper was born and raised on the Scottish archipelago of Orkney. He owns a private recording studio in London which has become home to some of the UK's most acclaimed left field producers, artists, and mix engineers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Gawain Erland Cooper, folk guitarist and singer with Erland and the Carnival", "*Gawain Erland Cooper (born 1985), Orcadian composer "]}, {"page": "Erland and the Carnival", "response": ["Erland & The Carnival were a British progressive folk rock band, formed in London, by Orcadian folk guitarist and singer Gawain Erland Cooper, multi-instrumentalist Simon Tong (formerly of The Verve, Blur and The Good, the Bad & the Queen), and drummer/engineer David Nock (The Orb, The Cult, The Fireman, David Gilmour, Paul McCartney).

If Orkney was the musical equivalent of great nature writing then Prospect of Skelmersdale is somewhere between finely-tuned kitchen-sink drama and urban psychogeography. Inspired as much by the greys and greens of Kes, as the soothing, cyclical patterns of meditative ragas, Prospect of Skelmersdale is a collection of musical snapshots of a uniquely British town.", "*Gawain Erland Cooper"]}, {"page": "Hannah Peel", "response": ["In 2018, Peel met Paul Weller through producer and co-songwriter Gawain Erland Cooper.
