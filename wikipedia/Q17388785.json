Nick Southwood co-wrote the new lyrics with the Hoyles, produced, mixed and performed bass and lead guitar. The single's cover is based on Abbey Road's cover. The song became the Christmas number one, beating the likes of Stormzy (#2), Lewis Capaldi (#3) and Dua Lipa (#4), and spent one week in the top 40. The couple were the third act to have two consecutive Christmas number one singles and the first to have two successive novelty Christmas number ones in the UK. On 27 December 2019, the record dropped from number 1 to number 57 and broke the record for the biggest ever drop from the top within the top 75 (as per The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles list, as \"Three Lions\" would have crashed out of the 'hit parade' by dropping to number 97 after it was number 1 in 2018). As with their previous single, all proceeds went to The Trussell Trust."]}]}}
