In 2013, Bain placed fifth in a Football League 125th Anniversary poll of Brentford's best ever captains and was inducted into the club's Hall of Fame in May 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["In March 1952, Lawton joined Second Division side Brentford for a club record \u00a316,000 fee. Manager Jackie Gibbons left the club at the start of the 1952\u201353 season and was succeeded by his assistant Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953\u201354 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing Dear Old Pals."]}, {"page": "Jackie Gibbons", "response": ["Gibbons managed Brentford until the end of the 1951\u201352 season, making three consecutive top 10 finishes in the Second Division, but he found himself at odds with the club's board during a difficult time financially for the Bees. A falling out with star wing halves Jimmy Hill and Ron Greenwood towards the end of 1951 saw the Bees' form tail off, with the club finishing the 1951\u201352 season in 10th place, after challenging for promotion in mid-season. Gibbons resigned in August 1952 and was replaced by his assistant, Jimmy Bain."]}, {"page": "Harry Curtis (football manager)", "response": ["Curtis and recently appointed assistant manager Jimmy Bain guided Brentford to fifth and two successive sixth-place finishes in the club's first three seasons in the First Division. Crowds at Griffin Park averaged 25,000 and in the 1937\u201338 season and Brentford led the First Division table for three months and reached the sixth round of the FA Cup for the first time. Brentford's sustained period of success was consolidated by Curtis' man-management abilities and his astuteness in the transfer market, bringing in Scottish internationals Dave McCulloch, Bobby Reid and Duncan McKenzie, Welsh internationals Idris Hopkins and Les Boulter, with Billy Scott and Les Smith going on to represent England."]}]}}
