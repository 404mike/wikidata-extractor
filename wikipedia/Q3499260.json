Some media attention was given to Tracey Emin's exhibit My Bed, which was a double bed in a dishevelled state with stained sheets, surrounded by detritus such as soiled underwear, condoms, slippers and empty drink bottles. Two artists, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, jumped onto the bed, stripped to their underwear, and had a pillow fight. Police detained the two, who called their performance Two Naked Men Jump into Tracey's Bed. Other nominees included Steven Pippin and collaborative sibling duo Jane and Louise Wilson."]}, {"page": "Young British Artists", "response": ["* Steven Pippin"]}, {"page": "List of contemporary artists", "response": ["* Steven Pippin (born 1960), sculptor"]}, {"page": "Recycling symbol", "response": ["A satirical version of the classic recycling logo also exists, in which the three arrows are twisted from a circular pattern to pointing radially outward, thus symbolizing wasteful one-time usage rather than environmentally friendly recycling.  This message is reinforced by the circular inscription, \"THIS PROJECT WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY UNFRIENDLY\", surrounding the modified logo.  The satirical logo appears in the 1998 catalog of an installation art work in Bayonne, New Jersey, in which the artist Steven Pippin modified a row of glass-doored washing machines in a laundromat to operate as giant cameras.  The cameras were used to take sequential photographs in the manner of pioneering stop motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge.  The front-loading washing machines were then used to develop and process the 24\u00a0inch (61\u00a0cm) diameter circular film negatives."]}]}}
