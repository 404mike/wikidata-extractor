Wales qualified for its first major international tournament at the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Five Cardiff players were selected in the nation's 23-man squad for the competition: Colin Baker, Ron Hewitt, Ken Jones, Derrick Sullivan and Graham Vearncombe. Sullivan became the first Cardiff player to feature in a World Cup during Wales' opening fixture against Hungary. Baker and Hewitt also played in the competition, while goalkeepers Jones and Vearncombe remained unused reserves. In 2003, Australian defender Tony Vidmar became the first Cardiff player to represent a country from outside the British Isles. The final nation of the British Isles to have a representative from Cardiff was England, when Jay Bothroyd won a single cap in 2010. Icelandic midfielder Aron Gunnarsson overtook Sherwood to become the club's most capped international player in 2016.

Although the Hungarian Golden Team had previously been considered one of the best teams in the world, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 had weakened the side as many of its players had fled the country. Nevertheless, Hungary quickly took the lead in the opening five minutes through J\u00f3zsef Bozsik. The Hungarian defensive efforts were largely focused on containing John Charles who received attention described as \"rugged tactics\" by The Times. Journalist Ian Wooldridge wrote that the Hungarian tactics were often \"just inside or wildly outside the international laws of soccer\". Charles scored an equaliser for Wales after 27 minutes, heading in from a corner to secure a 1\u20131 draw. In their second match, Wales played a Mexico side that had suffered a 3\u20130 defeat to Sweden in their opening game. The Welsh side entered the game as favourites but struggled to gain the advantage over their opponents. Ivor Allchurch gave Wales the lead in the first half but Mexico responded strongly and scored a late equaliser in the 89th minute with Wales having been reduced to 10 men after Colin Baker had been injured."]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 in English football", "response": ["* 11 April 2021: Colin Baker, 86, Wales and Cardiff City wing half.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25761229, Colin Baker: Cardiff City and Wales midfielder dies at 86, BBC Sport, 12 April 2021"]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*11 April \u2013 Colin Baker, Welsh professional footballer (b. 1934)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2021", "response": ["*Colin Baker, 86, Welsh footballer (Cardiff City, national team).Colin Baker: Cardiff City and Wales midfielder dies at 86"]}, {"page": "2021 in Wales", "response": ["*11 April \u2013 Colin Baker, Wales international footballer, 86"]}]}}
