Two weeks later, he beat Simon Whitlock 8\u20134 and registered the highest three-dart average in the history of the tournament of 117.35.

He was defeated by Kevin Painter in the 3rd round by 4 sets to 2.

In the quarter-finals of the 2001 World Matchplay, Taylor crushed Part 16\u20134. In the quarter-finals of the 2002 PDC World Championship, Part was again whitewashed by Taylor in a world championship, getting beaten 6\u20130, as the world's greatest player went on to win his eighth consecutive world championship and his tenth world championship in all. However, Part gave Taylor a serious test in the 2002 World Matchplay final. Part, in superb form and with great belief, matched Taylor throughout the match. In a first to 18 legs contest, Part led 16\u201315. But Taylor stunned the Canadian by winning three legs in a row to emerge an 18\u201316 winner in what is now regarded as a classic final. Part's wait for a first PDC major went on while Taylor's dominance continued. In October 2002, Part again reached a major final at the 2002 World Grand Prix, but the result was a similar story. This time Taylor comfortably defeated Part 7\u20133 in sets, although Part recovered from a slow start and a 1\u20135 deficit to give Taylor a challenge in the last 4 sets. Taylor and Part were now considered the two best players in the world, but there were serious doubts over whether Part could beat 'The Power' having already suffered five televised defeats, including two whitewashes in the World Championship and the painfully close loss in the 2002 World Matchplay. Going into the 2003 PDC World Championship, Taylor was the heavy favourite. However, Taylor showed more vulnerabilities during the tournament than at the previous few world championships, with both Wayne Mardle and Dennis Smith managing to win 3 sets off of Taylor. Taylor also comfortably won an anticlimactic grudge match in the semi-final against Alan Warriner by 6\u20131. Part, as the number two seed, reached the final as well, with a 5\u20133 win over Jamie Harvey in the second round, with Part hitting a vital 161 checkout when it was 3\u20133 in sets and 2\u20132 in legs with Harvey waiting on 40. Part then crushed Chris Mason 5\u20130 in the quarter-finals, though Part's semi-final was considerably more difficult. In a testing game, Part defeated Essex-born Kevin Painter 6\u20134 in a match not unlike his 2001 semi-final with Rod Harrington.", "But the disappointment was nothing compared to what would occur in the new year, as 2004 began with one of Part's most disastrous defeats of all. The Canadian entered the 2004 PDC World Championship as the reigning champion, but was unable to win even a single match in the defence of his title. In the first round he came up against debutant Mark Dudbridge but was stunned in a 4\u20133 defeat. Phil Taylor would go on to retake the World Championship crown with a 7\u20136 win over Kevin Painter in the final. In 2004, Part had much success in North America, where he again won the Canadian Open and Canadian National Championships, as well as winning the Golden Harvest North American Cup. Despite Taylor regaining the PDC World Championship, Part once again defeated 'The Power' in the 2004 UK Open quarter-final, with an 8\u20136 win. Part would then go on to reach his only major final of 2004 at the same event, but would once again fail to consolidate as he was soundly beaten 11\u20136 in the final by Roland Scholten. At the 2004 World Matchplay, Part began with a 10\u20130 whitewash of Colin Monk in the first round, and then had an epic win over Bob Anderson in the second round, where Part survived four match darts against him and eventually won in a tiebreak by 17\u201315. In his quarter final match against Andy Jenkins, Part struggled for much of the match and trailed 7\u201311, but Part fought his way back to eventually win 16\u201314, setting up a highly anticipated semi final match against Taylor, with Part having won 3 of his previous 4 matches against Taylor on Sky Sports. Despite Part's recent wins over Taylor on TV, Part started the semi final against Taylor very poorly, averaging in the low 80s and seeing Taylor cruise to an incredible 10\u20130 lead on a mid 90s average, as the 150/1 shot of a 17\u20130 whitewash looked a possibility. However, Part improved his game from the eleventh leg onwards, but losing the first 10 legs had left Part with far too much to do. Part restored plenty of respectability after his poor start, but Taylor won the match 17\u20138. After beating Part, Taylor went on to beat Mark Dudbridge 18\u20138 in the final, to win his fifth consecutive World Matchplay title and his seventh World Matchplay title in all.", "Part's other major results in 2006 were indifferent however, including Phil Taylor defeating Part 13\u20132 in the second round of the 2006 World Matchplay. The match was heavily hyped up beforehand with Part and Taylor having played many classic matches before and Part having beaten Taylor four times on television. However, their match at the 2006 World Matchplay was in complete contrast to their classic matches from the past, being a flat anti-climax throughout as Taylor played below average and Part played very poor throughout. Part also had another disappointing World Championship in 2007. This time he was eliminated tamely in the second round by Chris Mason. The defeat meant that Part had not reached the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championship since his epic world title victory in 2003, while van Barneveld went on to defeat Phil Taylor 7\u20136 in a similarly momentous final. But for the rest of 2007, Part returned to some of his best form. He reached three semi-finals of televised majors: US Open; the World Grand Prix, and the Las Vegas Desert Classic (though he could not defend his title in the latter). These consistent performances meant he entered the 2008 PDC World Championship as the 11th seed, though he was not considered one of the favourites for the event. Nevertheless, Part advanced steadily through the tournament, setting the tournament's highest average in the second round against Mensur Suljovi\u0107. He then came through a tight quarter-final against the 2007 PDC Player of the Year and third seed James Wade, winning in a deciding set 5\u20134. In the semi-final he faced Kevin Painter, reminiscent of his 2003 triumph; Part once again emerged victorious, 6\u20132 this time, and found himself in his fourth world championship final.", "At the 2012 World Championship he made it to the quarter-finals for the first time since his 2008 title. He dropped just three sets on his way to the last 8 by defeating John Henderson, Richie Burnett and Kevin Painter. He was involved in one of the greatest matches ever seen at the World Championships against James Wade. Wade opened up a 3\u20131 set lead, before his form started to dip to coincide with Part scoring heavier and hitting more doubles to win 3 sets in a row. The players broke each other's throws twice in the deciding set to require a sudden-death leg, which Wade managed to win. Part said afterwards that it was \"the greatest game I've ever lost!\".", "He qualified for the European Championship and lost in the first round 4\u20136 to Kevin Painter, despite hitting a 170 checkout and having a dart at the bullseye for a second one to lead 5\u20134.
