(1908\u20131980)", "response": ["York's first match in the Football League was against Wigan Borough at Springfield Park on 31 August 1929 and finished with a 2\u20130 victory for the visitors. Reg Stockill, the scorer of the first goal, became the youngest player to represent the club in a competitive match at the age of 15 years and 281 days. The 1929\u201330 season brought two meetings with First Division team Newcastle United in the FA Cup third round, and a sixth-place finish in York's debut Football League season. Collier resigned as manager in May 1930 and Billy Sherrington took over for the following three years, combining this with his role as club secretary. Sherrington's first season in charge saw York rank 12th in the league, and they again faced First Division opposition in the FA Cup third round, taking Sheffield United to a replay. Despite an improved league position of ninth in 1931\u201332, York were eliminated from the FA Cup in the first round. This, combined with disappointing average home crowds, resulted in a deficit of \u00a31,539 over the season. In August 1932, York moved to a new ground at Bootham Crescent, which was closer than Fulfordgate to the club's centre of support and the railway station. The ground was officially opened for a match with Stockport County on 31 August 1932; it ended a 2\u20132 draw, and the first goalscorer at the ground was Tom Mitchell. York's worst performance in the Football League to date came in 1932\u201333, finishing in 20th place. The club only avoided having to seek re-election after winning the last match of the season."]}, {"page": "List of people from York", "response": ["*Reg Stockill (1913\u20131995)"]}, {"page": "Reg Stockhill", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reg Stockill"]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 York City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=row|Reg Stockill"]}]}}
