Between 1930 and 1942 he was the Music Director of the City of Birmingham Orchestra.Heward was born in Liversedge, Yorkshire, the son of a railway porter and organist. He showed remarkable musical promise as a child. By the age of two he was playing the piano, by the age of four he was playing the organ, and by the age of eight he was accompanying a performance of Handel's Messiah on the organ in Bradford. At 12 he was a choir boy at Manchester Cathedral, supported by the organist there, Sidney Nicholson. In 1917 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. There he was one of the first pupils in Adrian Boult's conducting class, and was described by Hubert Parry as \"the kind of phenomenon that appears once in a generation\".After leaving the College Heward took teaching posts at Eton and Westminster, became chorus master and subsequently a conductor for the British National Opera Company, and (from 1924 to 1926) was appointed conductor of the Cape Town Orchestra and director of music to the South African Broadcasting Corporation. He broadcast so frequently there that he had to conceal his identity under half-a-dozen aliases. Returning to the UK, Heward took over as conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra when Adrian Boult left to become Music Director at the BBC in 1930. Heward gained the respect of the orchestra's players, introduced bold programming, with 28 Birmingham premieres in his first season, and attracted front-rank soloists. In 1934 the BBC asked Heward to conduct the Midland Orchestra, which shared many players with the CBO.However, the orchestra lost much of its funding and many of its players at the outbreak of World War II. At the same time Heward's health was in decline, his tuberculosis aggravated by smoking and heavy drinking. At the end of 1942 he was offered the post of Conductor of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester, but was too ill to take up the post. He died at his Edgbaston home (43 Harborne Road, Five Ways, Birmingham) in May the following year, aged just 45.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Four conductors were shortlisted to succeed Boult and were given trial concerts \u2013 Leslie Heward, Stanley Chapple, Julius Harrison and Basil Cameron \u2013 but Boult later described how \"Heward very easily won the palm\". Heward had studied conducting under Boult at the Royal College of Music, where Hubert Parry had described him as \"the kind of phenomenon that appears once in a generation\". He came to Birmingham from a highly successful period as Music Director of the South African Broadcasting Corporation and Conductor of the Cape Town Orchestra, where he had raised the standards of the orchestra's playing to the extent that they were invited to England perform at the Empire Exhibition in 1925. Despite this, his appointment was a gamble for the CBO committee, as he was still largely unknown to English audiences.", "Rignold updated the orchestra's repertoire, conducting 31 premieres during his tenure. The era saw Birmingham's first complete performances of works including Debussy's Images, Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, Schoenberg's Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht and Walton's Violin Concerto, and a series themed around \"Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century\" was held in 1966 and 1967. Like Leslie Heward and Rudolf Schwarz before him, Rignold was particularly committed to the music of Sibelius, giving a complete cycle of his symphonies in 1966. The most significant premiere of the period, indeed of the CBSO's entire history, saw the orchestra play the first performance of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem at the dedication of Coventry Cathedral in 1962, accompanied by Peter Pears, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Heather Harper and the Melos Ensemble, conducted by Meredith Davies and the composer himself.  This event saw the orchestra attracting international attention for the first time since the first Boult era. The Daily Telegraph described the work as \"a masterpiece of the first order\", Fischer-Dieskau wept during rehearsals and at the end of the performance Harper noticed that \"all around her people were in tears\".", "* Leslie Heward (1930\u20131943)"]}, {"page": "Maurice Maeterlinck", "response": ["** incidental music by Leslie Heward"]}, {"page": "Ernest John Moeran", "response": ["Moeran led an itinerant life in the 1930s, staying at his parents' various homes or with friends. However, as the decade progressed, he became more interested in his Irish roots, and began to spend large parts of the year in a cottage in Kenmare, County Kerry, where he became a well known and popular figure; Arnold Bax recorded a local comment: \"If ever there was a move to elect a mayor of this town, Jack Moeran would be everybody's first choice\".  The peace that he found in rural Ireland inspired him to return, in 1934, to the long-abandoned symphony project. In the midst of this burgeoning creativity, Moeran continued to experience problems with alcoholism. In January 1935 he was ordered to spend nine months in a nursing home, having been found guilty in Cambridge of being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle. This interrupted but did not derail his work on the symphony, which was finally completed in 1937 and received its premiere in January 1938 in the Queen's Hall, under Leslie Heward.
