He was raised at Hillsborough Castle, the official residence of the monarch in Northern Ireland, where his father served as private secretary and comptroller general to the James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn, the first Governor of  Northern Ireland. His younger brother was the television executive Robert Brumwell \"Brum\" Henderson.Henderson served in World War II as part of the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army and, in 1949, achieved the honorary rank of captain. In the aftermath of 1953 Northern Ireland general election, he became a member of the Northern Ireland House of Commons for the safe Belfast Victoria seat.  His election saw the Unionist majority against Labour slashed from 8,907 in 1949 to 1,662.  In 1958 he narrowly lost the seat to David Bleakley.  The same year he was appointed, at Ulster Television, to the executive position of director, before taking up the post of managing director of the Belfast Newsletter and then moving to Chairman of Century Newspapers in 1964.Henderson's family owned the Newsletter from 1844 until 1991. From 1964 to 1991, he was the final member of the Henderson family to be in control of the publication and, by the time of his retirement, was the only member of a three-person Board with executive responsibilities.  Century Newspapers, the holding company, sold the title to Thompson Regional Newspapers in 1991 as the family could no longer guarantee the viability of the paper following Bill Henderson's retirement despite attempts to hire suitably qualified management.Between 1970 and 1981 he was President of Knock Motor Cycle & Car Club in Belfast and, in Spring 2005, became a trustee of the Ulster Reform Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of members of the 8th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Bill Henderson"]}, {"page": "William Henderson", "response": ["*Bill Henderson (performer) (1926\u20132016), American jazz vocalist and actor", "*Bill Henderson (Canadian singer) (born 1944), Canadian singer, songwriter and music producer", "*Bill Henderson (Northern Ireland politician) (1924\u20132010), Ulster journalist, television executive, politician", "*Bill Henderson (Isle of Man legislator) (born 1961), Manx legislator", "*Bill Henderson (Wyoming politician), American member of the Wyoming House of Representatives", "*Bill Henderson (manager) (1857\u20131929), American MLB manager", "*Bill Henderson (pitcher) (1901\u20131966), American pitcher", "*Bill Henderson (footballer, born 1878) (1878\u20131945), Scottish full back", "*Bill Henderson (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u20131964), Scottish forward", "*Bill Henderson (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131934), English outside right", "*Bill Henderson (soccer) (born 1929), Australian goalkeeper", "*Bill Henderson (Australian rules footballer) (1887\u20131956), footballer for Richmond and Melbourne", "*Bill Henderson (coach) (1901\u20131979), American basketball coach", "*Bill Henderson (curler), Scottish curler", "*Bill Henderson (novelist) (born 1943), American author", "*Bill Henderson (publisher) (born 1941), American author, editor and publisher"]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*22 October \u2013 Bill Henderson, politician (b. 1924)"]}, {"page": "Bill Henderson (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Henderson (Northern Ireland politician)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2010", "response": ["*Bill Henderson, 86, Northern Irish politician and newspaper proprietor."]}, {"page": "Bill Henderson (Northern Ireland)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Henderson (Northern Ireland politician)"]}]}}
