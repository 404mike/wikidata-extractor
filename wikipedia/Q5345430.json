He went to school at Penralltgoch and was then apprenticed to his brother, William.  He began preaching and in 1843 he went to the Congregational college at Bala to train as a minister.  While there he changed his name to Edward Stephen to avoid confusion with another Edward Jones.  In 1847 he became a minister at Dwygyfylchi in Caernarfonshire and in 1852 he composed an oratorio entitled Ystorm Tiberias.  In 1856 he moved to another chapel at Llanllechid, and two years later he composed a requiem in memory of John Jones, Talysarn.
