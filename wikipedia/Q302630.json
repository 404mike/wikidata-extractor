He was twice chairman of Gosbank, the central bank of the Soviet Union (1921\u20131924 and 1926\u20131929).In 1922 Lenin wrote him a scathing letter accusing him of being a \"communist-mandarin\" stating that Gosbank was \"a bureaucratic paper game\" suggesting that Sheinman had become blinded to the truth by being too engrossed in \"the sweet communist-official lies\".In 1933 he started work for Intourist in London and filled the post of Director from 1937 to 1939. When he was dismissed he refused to return to Moscow, and gained British citizenship later that year.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
