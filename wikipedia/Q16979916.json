She has made contributions to multiple areas of cell biology, including determining the function of several genes in HIV and describing the importance of a gene's location within the cell nucleus.\nAs a postdoctoral researcher, she produced the first functional copies of HIV, providing researchers with access to enough biologically active material to study the function of the virus's genes. She later became interested in epigenetics and nuclear reprogramming, particularly in white blood cells known as lymphocytes and embryonic stem cells. As of 2016 her research focuses on how gene expression patterns are inherited when cells divide, using lymphocytes as a model system.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Amanda Fisher, British cell biologist"]}, {"page": "List of Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*2017: Elizabeth Nneka Anionwu, Vera Baird, Inga Beale, Hilary Boulding, Carmen Callil, Sarah Connolly, Olivia De Havilland, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Amanda Fisher, Helen Fraser, Barbara Frost, Katherine Grainger, Carolyn Hamilton, Jane Jiang, Parveen Kumar, Gwynneth Knowles, Ottoline Leyser, Theresa Marteau, Helena Morrissey, Jane Moulder, Patricia Routledge, Cilla Snowball, Angela Strank, Julie Walters, Caroline Leigh Watkins, June Whitfield, Anna Wintour, Amanda Yip"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2014", "response": ["#Professor Amanda Fisher FRS"]}]}}
