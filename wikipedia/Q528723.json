The British government's Home Office, under the supervision of James Lester (Ben Miller) and Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown), becomes involved after a Gorgonopsid travels through one such anomaly and wreaks havoc in the Forest of Dean. Professor Cutter's wife, Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey), presumed dead for eight years, was revealed to have been travelling in time through the anomalies. Cutter was unable to convince her to help as she had changed much from the woman he had once known, and he began to fall in love with Claudia.

He also keeps his encounter with his long lost wife, Helen, to himself. He can be quite spiteful at times as his last words to Stephen Hart (James Murray) before heading through the anomaly in episode 1.6 are to push Lester through the nastiest anomaly he can find if he does not make it back. He withholds information from his friends and teammates and Connor notes in episode 1.1 that he never turns up for his own seminars. He also tries to make demands of Lester in episode 1.3 he is ordered to bring Helen back only to be shocked when Lester overrules his decision and brings his wife back by force.

Lester foils the attempt by releasing a Columbian mammoth which is being kept safe inside the ARC, which impales the predator on its tusks. Lester later jokingly suggests keeping the mammoth as a pet for his kids, if the team was unable to find the creature a home. This is the first time Lester mentions having a family. Lester then decides to take charge of the next anomaly investigation himself, however it turns out to be a false alarm, set up as a diversion by Leek while he lures Cutter's team to his secret facility. Lester arrives at the scene of the false alarm to find only a note reading \"BAD LUCK\". In the final episode, Lester shows much more support and concern for the team, and goes to the extent of calling Stephen Hart (James Murray) to try to help out. However, he is set up by Helen, and portrayed as a bad guy throughout the final episode (by Stephen and Helen's perspective). He also sides with Cutter, who seems willing to die to prevent anyone else from being killed. When Cutter destroys the neural clamps, releasing the predators from Leek's control, Lester insists on watching Leek being devoured by his former pets and seems unfazed by it as opposed to the horrified reactions of the other people watching, including his assistant Lorraine Wickes. When the death of Leek is over, he casually tells Lorraine to: \"turn that off will you?\". He also discovers the secret locations of Leek's menagerie, and mops them all up one by one.

Caroline and Connor meet in a DVD store and he invites her back to Abby's flat with him. After Connor nearly gets eaten by a giant worm in the episode and gets covered in giant worm slime, he accidentally wipes Caroline's number off his hand. Connor clearly worries about Caroline, and by the end of the episode seems to put her ahead of Abby, much to the latter's confusion. In episode 2.4, Connor is distraught when Abby is mistaken as dead, and searches for her. He does eventually find her, but is dragged into the future by the Mer. When Abby is dangling from the side of a cliff, Connor tells her that he loves her. Abby later confronts Connor about this, but due to embarrassment, did not re-approach the matter, and went on a date with Caroline, leaving Abby upset and confused. In episode 2.5, Connor dumps Caroline after he believes that the two are not ideal for one another. (In fact, unknown to him, Caroline has been paid by Leek to spy on Connor.) This now opens him up to Abby, and seeks Stephen Hart's (James Murray) help as he is still unsure of whether Abby is interested in him. Connor remained faithful to Abby throughout the final episode of the season, and drags her out of a fight with Caroline. Connor was shocked to find out that Caroline only went out with him because she was getting paid. Leek says that he and Connor are similar, saying that they are both \"Uncool, nerdy and never get the attractive girls\". To this Connor makes another sarcastic remark, saying \"Speak for yourself\". Connor is very caring towards Abby, Caroline and Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown), whom he makes sure all climb the ladder to escape before he does. Finally, Connor is seen at the end of the episode at Stephen's funeral. He seems close to Abby, but surprisingly Caroline is invited to the funeral, despite the fact the two characters never met.
