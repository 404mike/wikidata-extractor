Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio, the ballet Javotte, the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces. In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, \"Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself\u00a0... there are Masses, all of which are interesting.

The JdP was the first purpose-built concert hall to be built in Oxford since the Holywell Music Room in 1742. Built in 1995 by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, it houses the Steinway-equipped Edward Boyle Auditorium and a number of music practice rooms. In 2000 the architects designed a new, enlarged foyer space; a lean-to glass structure along the front elevation to the existing music building. In addition to frequent recitals presented by the St Hilda's Music Society, the JdP also hosts concerts by a number of world-renowned performers. Musicians who have performed in the JdP in recent years include Steven Isserlis, the Jerusalem Quartet, the Chilingirian Quartet and the Belcea Quartet. The building has also been used for amateur dramatic performances, since 2008 St Hilda's College Drama Society have been producing several plays a year in the Edward Boyle Auditorium."]}, {"page": "Stephen Kovacevich", "response": ["Kovacevich often performs chamber works; his chamber music partners have included Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9, Martha Argerich, Steven Isserlis, Nigel Kennedy, Lynn Harrell, Sarah Chang, Gautier Capu\u00e7on, Renaud Capu\u00e7on and Emmanuel Pahud."]}, {"page": "Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["The orchestra under Paavo Berglund made the world premiere recording of Sibelius's Kullervo in 1970.

O'Cathain, described by Morrison as \"a Thatcherite free marketeer\", dismissed the LSO and RSC as \"arty-farty types\", and opposed public subsidy.

Then aged 24, he was described by The Guardian as \"the musical discovery of the year\", while The Times said he was \"among the very best creative talents of his generation\". During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for The Protecting Veil, which as recorded by cellist Steven Isserlis became a best-selling album, and Song for Athene which was sung at the funeral of Princess Diana. The Lamb featured in the soundtrack for Paolo Sorrentino's film The Great Beauty. Tavener was knighted in 2000 for his services to music and won an Ivor Novello Award. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by Sarum College in 2001. ", "Tavener's subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in Akhmatova Requiem: this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its Proms' performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished. Of more lasting success was Tavener's short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of William Blake's poem \"The Lamb\", written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon's third birthday. This simple homophonic piece is usually performed as a Christmas carol. Later prominent works include The Akathist of Thanksgiving of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; The Protecting Veil, first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the London Symphony Orchestra at the 1989 Proms; and Song for Athene (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by Mother Thekla, a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011. Song for Athene in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.", "Tavener died, aged 69, on 12 November 2013 at his home in Child Okeford, Dorset.BBC News (12 November 2013). \"Sir John Tavener: Composer dies aged 69\".

A tribute was also received from Charles, Prince of Wales.", "John Rutter describes Tavener as having the \"very rare gift\" of being able to \"bring an audience to a deep silence.\" According to Steven Isserlis: \"He had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular \u2013 he was writing the music he had to write.\""]}]}}
