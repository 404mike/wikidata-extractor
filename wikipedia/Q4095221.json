Here he combined a feeling for structure (creating a surprising series of discrete spaces) with a love of plants and a willingness to experiment with novel plant combinations. An enthusiastic plant collector, he sponsored or undertook several expeditions in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America to bring back rare specimens. In 1922 he went plant-hunting in the alps with Edward Augustus Bowles; and in 1923 sponsored W. T. Goethe on a plant-hunting expedition to the Andes.

He also made collection trips to the United Provinces, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, Bengal, South Canara and Travancore. Along with T. Edwards, Elwes wrote a monograph on the Oriental Hesperiidae.Rao, B R Subba (1998) History of Entomology in India. Institution of Agricultural Technologists. Bangalore. He also made a trip to the Altai region in 1898. His posthumously published Memoirs (1930) includes a chapter describing his visit to Nepal in 1914, at a time when Europeans were seldom admitted. He also mentions an unnamed companion, now known to be the English naturalist Aubyn Trevor-Battye, who took some of the photographs used to illustrate this chapter.This visit is described in an unpublished manuscript: Indian Journal 1914 by Aubyn Trevor-Battye, now in the possession of A.T-B's descendants, along with the original photographs Elwes was famous for his breeding of Nerine and Eremurus. Horticulturalist and garden writer Edward Augustus Bowles noted that he was specially interested in Arisaema, Crinum, Crocus, Fritillaria and Iris, as well as Kniphofia, Paeonia and Yucca. Bowles' memoir in Elwes' posthumous biography offers most information about the Colesbourne garden, but even this is scanty."]}, {"page": "Bowles (surname)", "response": ["*Edward Augustus Bowles (1865\u20131954), British horticulturalist and writer"]}, {"page": "Victoria Medal of Honour", "response": ["**Edward Augustus Bowles (1865\u20131954)"]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Edward Augustus Bowles (1865\u20131954), botanist"]}, {"page": "Edward Bowles", "response": ["*Edward Augustus Bowles (1865\u20131954), English horticulturalist"]}, {"page": "Jason Hill", "response": ["*Jason Hill (gardener), pseudonym under which the physicist Dr. Frank Anthony Hampton wrote gardening books, see Edward Augustus Bowles"]}, {"page": "E A Bowles", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Augustus Bowles"]}, {"page": "E.A.
