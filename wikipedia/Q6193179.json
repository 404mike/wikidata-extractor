This occurred when neither Terceira nor Nisbett qualified for an Olympic spot at the equestrian finals in Hong Kong, caused in part by the injury of Terceira's horse, Navantus. Because Bermuda was allowed only one horse rider, the Bermuda Equestrian Federation awarded their one reserved Olympic spot to Nisbett because Terceira's horse had been injured during the course of the event.", "|align=left|Jillian Terceira"]}, {"page": "Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual jumping", "response": ["|align=left| Jillian Terceira ||align=left|  ||align=left| Chaka III || 4 || 1 || 5", "|align=left| Jillian Terceira ||align=left|  ||align=left| Chaka III ||colspan=2 data-sort-value=99| Eliminated || 5 ||data-sort-value=999|  || "]}, {"page": "Bermuda at the 2012 Summer Olympics", "response": ["Bermuda has qualified one rider in the show jumping event, based on its performance at the 2011 Pan American Games.Equestrian - List of qualified nations  Jillian Terceira, and her horse Bernadien van Westuur reached the second round where they knocked down two fences with an 8-point penalty; thus, the combined two round penalties caused her to fall short in order to reach the third round, and Terceira was eliminated from the competition.", "|align=left|Jillian Terceira"]}, {"page": "Equestrian at the 2011 Pan American Games \u2013 Individual jumping", "response": ["|align=left|Jillian Terceira||align=left|||align=left|Bernadien Van Westur", "|align=left|Jillian Terceira||align=left|||align=left|Bernadien Van Westur"]}, {"page": "Equestrian at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual jumping", "response": ["|align=left| Jillian Terceira ||align=left|  ||align=left| Bernadien van Westuur || 0 || 1 || 1 || ", "|rowspan=\"4\"|47||align=left| Jillian Terceira ||align=left|  ||align=left| Bernadien van Westuur || 8 || 0 || 1 || 9 || "]}, {"page": "Jill Terciera", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jillian Terceira"]}, {"page": "Bermuda at the 2015 Pan American Games", "response": ["|Jillian Terceira"]}, {"page": "Equestrian at the 2015 Pan American Games \u2013 Individual jumping", "response": ["|align=left|Jillian Terceira||align=left|||align=left|Tamerino", "|align=left|Jillian Terceira||align=left|||align=left|Tamerino"]}]}}
