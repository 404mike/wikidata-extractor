He played as a winger.\nAs a schoolboy Dark was associated with Arsenal, but when he left school in 1977 he joined Birmingham City as an apprentice, turning professional two years later. He made his debut as an 18-year-old when he came on as substitute for Stewart Barrowclough in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Leeds United in the First Division on 10 February 1979. He started the next two games, and made a further two substitute appearances later on in the 1978\u201379 season, at the end of which Birmingham were relegated; his progress was not improved by an attempt to convert him from winger to full back. He left Birmingham in 1981 for non-league football in the London area, spending time with Hendon, Carshalton Athletic, whom he joined early in the 1981\u201382 season, Fisher Athletic and Tooting & Mitcham United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1978\u201379 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Trevor Dark"]}]}}
