As World War I was underway, the main political parties had a national pact not to stand against each other, but the ILP opposed the war and decided to stand Bland in the election.  Aware that he would not receive the endorsement of the Labour Party, he did not seek it, but he received the full backing of the ILP, which financially sponsored his candidacy, and was also backed by the local trades council.  His campaign focused on ending the war by negotiation.  Standing against a single opponent, the Liberal William Somervell, Bland received 32.5% of the votes cast.  He declared that this total was in line with his expectations."]}]}}
