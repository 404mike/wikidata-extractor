Harrington House was owned by the family until the First World War; Since 1930 Harrington House has been home to the Russian Embassy. The exterior of the house was designed by Decimus Burton, following plans sketched by the Earl. Works were carried under the supervision of Charles James Richardson, who was the surveyor to the Earl's extensive South Kensington estate. Details and the final plans are thought to have been left to Richardson; he did, however, acknowledge the \"great measure\" the Earl was involved in the design. The house's unorthodox architecture was widely criticised, including by Richardson; Lord Harrington, however, thought it to be \"a house without a fault\"."]}, {"page": "13 Kensington Palace Gardens", "response": ["Harrington House was one of the largest houses on the road and was constructed in the Earl's favourite Gothic style; it cost around \u00a315,000 to construct.

The plates were lithographs by Vivian, mostly from architectural drawings by Charles James Richardson (but Richardson was only 14 years old when the Old Manor was destroyed and George Vivian is likely to have made the drawings). Richardson's Observations on the architecture of England during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James I of the same year is a related work having plates in common, dedicated to Vivian, and published by John Weale."]}]}}
