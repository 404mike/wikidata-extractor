Born in England, Mackie played for Scotland, his eligibility gained from his grandfather who was born in Kilmarnock.\nHe began his career at Wimbledon, progressing through the club's youth system and making his first-team debut in December 2003. A squad member when the club was renamed and moved to Milton Keynes, he made few appearances before joining Conference side Exeter City. He spent time on loan with Sutton United in 2005 and returned to establish himself as a first-team regular. His performances during the 2007\u201308 season attracted interest from other clubs and he signed for Plymouth Argyle in the January transfer window, scoring twice on his debut in the Championship. He appeared regularly for the club over the next two years and finished as the club's top goalscorer in the 2009\u201310 season. He joined Queens Park Rangers in May 2010, signing a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. In 2013, he joined Nottingham Forest before signing on loan for Reading in 2014 and then returning to QPR in 2015. In July 2018, at the age of 32, he signed a two-year contract with Oxford United of League One.
