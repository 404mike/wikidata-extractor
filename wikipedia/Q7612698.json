He made his league debut for the club during its promotion season of 1971\u201372. After he had a loan spell with AFC Bournemouth in 1975, he left Norwich permanently in 1976 to sign for Cardiff City for a fee of \u00a37,000. Grapes spent six years at Ninian Park as the club struggled in the lower divisions and was released in 1982 following their relegation to division three. He joined Torquay United and later played for Bath City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robin Friday", "response": ["While Hurley had been able to command Friday's respect, it soon became clear that Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday appeared one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. \"He still called me boss\", Hurley recalled. \"I can't play for that little bastard\", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. \"You're the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can I come back to you?\" Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the \u00a328,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, \"Tickets, please!\", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. Steve Grapes, who was standing near the forward, started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched Grapes in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards."]}, {"page": "Severnside derby", "response": ["|Steve Grapes, Peter Kitchen"]}, {"page": "Grapes (surname)", "response": ["*Steve Grapes (born 1953), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Steve Grapes"]}, {"page": "Grapes, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve Grapes"]}]}}
