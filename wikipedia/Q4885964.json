Swindon manager Maurice Malpas commented that he would like to see Morrison and fellow youth player Ben Joyce gain first team experience, and Morrison made his professional debut on 26 April 2008 against Gillingham at the age of seventeen, coming on as a first-half substitute for Jerel Ifil during a 1\u20131 draw.
