As mentioned above, Bethleham Steel and New Bedford finished tied for second place.  This led to a playoff game which, ironically, did not take place until February 22, 1928, nearly two weeks after the second half of the season began.NEW BEDFORD PLAYS HERE ON SATURDAY DECIDING SECOND PLACE  In that game, played in Tiverton, Rhode Island, the Whalers defeated the Steelmen, 2-0.  Further complications arose at the end of the second half.  When New Bedford and the Fall River Marksmen finished as the top two teams this led to an unbalanced playoff.  The league had intended to have a four team playoff, but the playoff now consisted of three teams \u2013 Boston, New Bedford and Fall River.  Therefore, the league first decided to allow Bethlehem Steel to enter as the fourth team.  This led to a protest by the New York Nationals that they deserved to be the fourth team on account of finishing above Bethlehem Steel in the second half.  The league executives decided then to include both the Nationals and Bethlehem Steel, making the playoffs a five-team affair.The Globe-Times \u2013 Bethlehem, Friday, June 1, 1928  Bethlehem Steel defeated the Nationals in a two-game series, the first on June 4 and the second on June 6th.BETHLEHEM STEEL BLANKS NATIONALS  Three days later, Bethlehem met the Boston Soccer Club in the first game of their semifinal series.  The Bethlehem players were clearly fatigued and their goalkeeper, Dave Edwards went down injured as Bethlehem lost.  Rather than travel back to their home stadium in Pennsylvania for the second leg of the series, Bethlehem elected to play at Hawthorne Stadium in Brooklyn.  This was home to the Brooklyn Wanderers.  While there, Bethlehem requested the Wanderers loan their goalkeeper, future Aberdeen great Steve Smith, to replace the injured Edwards.  However, Bethlehem Steel failed to notify league officials that Smith would be a guest player.  After Bethlehem won the game, 4-0, going through on aggregate, Boston lodged a complaint which the league sustained.  The second game was declared void and Boston's first leg victory became the deciding game in the semifinal.  In the other semifinal, the New Bedford Whalers defeated the Fall River Marksmen.  However, two players from each team were sent off in the second game.  Then Sturdy Maxwell, one of the ejected Whalers players got into a post-game fight with Tec White of the Marksmen.  The league suspended White and Maxwell, depriving the Whalers of their starting right half.Soccer President Tosses out Game and Suspends Two Players  In the final between the Boston Soccer Club and New Bedford Whalers, both teams scored in the first half, but the Whalers clinched the championship with three second half goals by Barney Battles Jr.", "The league voided the result of the second leg game after it was discovered Bethlehem Steel used Steve Smith, the Brooklyn Wanderers goalkeeper, in place of the injured Dave Edwards."]}, {"page": "John Hempsey", "response": ["Hempsey began his career at Port Glasgow Athletic (no official appearances registered) before moving to Morton in 1911.
