EU envoy Bildt, one of the few critics of the operation, accused Croatia of the most efficient ethnic cleansing carried out in the Yugoslav Wars. Croatia denied this claiming it had \u201curged Serbs to stay\u201d, however soldiers also engaged in shelling of Serb inhabited areas, killing of civilians and allowed Croats in burning and plundering of Serb homes, according to a UN report.  His view is supported by a number of Western analysts, such as historians Marie-Janine Calic, Gerard Toal and Carl T. Dahlman, Milo\u0161evic biographer Adam LeBor, and Professor Paul Mojzes, but rejected by then-US ambassador Galbraith. Red Cross officials, United Nations observers, and Western diplomats condemned Galbraith's denial of the ethnic cleansing, with one ambassador calling Galbraith's remarks, \"breathtaking.\" In the Gotovina Defence Final Trial Brief, Gotovina's lawyers Luka Misetic, Greg Kehoe and Payam Akhavan rejected the accusation of mass expulsion of Serbian population.Gotovina Defence Final Trial Brief, 27 July 2010, pp. 96\u201399 They referred to the ICTY testimony of RSK Commander Mile Mrk\u0161i\u0107, who stated that on 4 August 1995, sometime after 16:00 hrs, it was Milan Marti\u0107 and his staff who in fact made a decision to evacuate the Serb population from Krajina to Srb, a village near the Bosnian border.ICTY Transcript, 19 June 2009, p. 18934.

In 1922, Melchior was appointed Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Hamburg based pharmaceutical-related consumer products giant Beiersdorf AG. His growing influence in the German economic community resulted in his 1926 appointment as the German representative on the League of Nations' Finance Committee. In 1928, he was named Committee chairman and following its creation in 1930, he served as a member of the board of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. In 1933, and by then its vice-president, he was forcibly dismissed by the new Nazi administration in Berlin, with the silent acquiescence of his colleagues .Adam LeBor.

They contend that, contrary to advice from Stamboli\u0107, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had denounced Pavlovi\u0107 as being soft on Albanian radicals. LeBor and Sell assert that Milo\u0161evi\u0107 prepared the ground for his ascent to power by quietly replacing Stamboli\u0107's supporters with his own people, thereby forcing Pavlovi\u0107 and Stamboli\u0107 from power.", "During the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 urged Serbians and Montenegrins to \"take to the streets\" and utilized the slogan \"Strong Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia\" that drew support from Serbs and Montenegrins but alienated the other Yugoslav nations. To these groups, Milo\u0161evi\u0107's agenda reminded them of the Serb hegemonic political affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Rankovi\u0107's policies. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 appealed to nationalist and populist passion by speaking of Serbia's importance to the world and in a Belgrade speech on 19 November 1988, he spoke of Serbia as facing battles against both internal and external enemies. In Vojvodina, a mob of pro-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 demonstrators that included 500 Kosovo Serbs and local Serbs demonstrated at the provincial capital, accusing the leadership in Vojvodina of supporting separatism and for being \"traitors\". In August 1988, meetings by supporters of the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution were held in many locations in Serbia and Montenegro, with increasingly violent nature, with calls being heard such as \"Give us arms!\", \"We want weapons!\", \"Long live Serbia\u2014death to Albanians!\", and \"Montenegro is Serbia!\" In the same month, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 began efforts designed to destabilize the governments in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina to allow him to install his followers in those republics. By 1989, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his supporters controlled Central Serbia along with the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, supporters in the leadership of Montenegro, and agents of the Serbian security service were pursuing efforts to destabilize the government in Bosnia & Herzegovina. The new government of Montenegro led by Momir Bulatovi\u0107 was seen by some as a satellite of Serbia.Sabrina P. Ramet. Serbia Since 1989: Politics and Society Under Milos\u0306evi\u0107 and After.

In 1989, the Serbian media began to speak of \"the alleged imperilment of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina\", as tensions between Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats increased over Serb support for Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Efforts to spread the cult of personality of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 into the republic of Macedonia began in 1989 with the introduction of slogans, graffiti, and songs glorifying Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Furthermore, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 proposed a law to restore land titles held by Serbs in the interwar period that effectively provided a legal basis for large numbers of Serbs to move to Kosovo and Macedonia to regain those lands. Beginning in 1989, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 gave support to Croatian Serbs who were vouching for the creation of an autonomous province for Croatian Serbs, which was opposed by Croatian communist authorities. In the late 1980s, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 allowed the mobilization of Serb nationalist organizations to go unhindered by actions from the Serbian government, with Chetniks holding demonstrations, and the Serbian government embracing the Serbian Orthodox Church and restored its legitimacy in Serbia."]}, {"page": "The Red House Report", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adam LeBor#The Red House Report "]}, {"page": "Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize", "response": ["* Adam LeBor, City of Oranges (Bloomsbury)"]}, {"page": "LeBor, Adam", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adam LeBor"]}]}}
