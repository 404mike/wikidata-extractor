An experienced staff officer and veteran of several actions of the First World War aboard the battlecruiser HMS Tiger, Blagrove had only just received his appointment as commander of the 2nd Battleship Squadron of the Home Fleet when he was killed in the destruction of his flagship HMS Royal Oak by German submarine U-47.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Phoney War", "response": ["* 14 October 1939, the British battleship  was sunk in the main British fleet base at Scapa Flow, Orkney (north of mainland Scotland) by .

Reloading his bow tubes, he doubled back and fired a salvo of three torpedoes, all at Royal Oak. This time he was successful. At 01:16, all three struck the battleship in quick succession amidships and detonated. The explosions blew a hole in the armoured deck, destroying the Stokers', Boys' and Marines' messes and causing a loss of electrical power. Cordite from a magazine ignited and the ensuing fireball passed rapidly through the ship's internal spaces. Royal Oak quickly listed to 15\u00b0, sufficient to push the open starboard-side portholes below the waterline. She soon rolled further onto her side to 45\u00b0, hanging there for several minutes before disappearing beneath the surface at 01:29, 13 minutes after Prien's second strike. 835 men died with the ship or died later of their wounds. The dead included Rear-Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the Second Battle Squadron. 134 of the dead were boy seamen, not yet 18 years old, the largest ever such loss in a single Royal Navy action."]}, {"page": "G\u00fcnther Prien", "response": ["Prien pressed on and passed through the narrow entrance to the sound. He selected the wrong channel\u2014between Lamb Holm and Burray\u2014recognising the mistake in time. He disregarded D\u00f6nitz's idea to pass south of the two blockships and instead sailed between the centre and northern block ship. The tide allowed the entry to be made rapidly. Prien and his crew were temporarily snared, or ran aground. Only by reversing at maximum revolutions did the U-boat free itself. U-47 entered the Flow at 00:27. Prien and his watch officers found the anchorage to be empty. Eventually they spotted \"two battleships\", in reality, just one; . The other was the  seaplane tender Pegasus. Prien began the attack at 00:55 and concluded it at 01:28. He fired seven torpedoes, some of which failed or ran widely off target. Nevertheless, the battleship was struck by several of the second salvo and sank in 13 minutes. The sinking killed 835 of her crew, including Rear Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron. At 02:15 U-47 exited the Flow and ordered flank speed to escape. He logged in the war diary, \"a pity that only one was destroyed.\" Prien thought he had damaged the Repulse lying behind Royal Oak, but it was not present\u2014the Pegasus was not hit. In the U-boat's war diary at 02:15 he wrote, \"I still have five torpedoes for any merchant targets that come our way.\""]}, {"page": "Harry Lloyd", "response": ["Lloyd was born in London, the son of Marion Evelyn (n\u00e9e Dickens), a children's publisher, and Jonathan Lloyd, who heads a literary agency.
