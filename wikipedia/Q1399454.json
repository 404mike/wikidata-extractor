He was educated at Harrow and King's College, Cambridge, where he took part in stagings of Handel oratorios in the 1930s.After World War II, he became notable as a writer on music, particularly when he published several articles about the compositions of Bizet, starting with La Coupe du roi de Thul\u00e9 in Music & Letters in 1947. He considerably rewrote his 1948 book on Bizet in 1965 due to new material and music of the composer which had since emerged. From 1965 he wrote articles criticizing the Oeser edition of Carmen, listing many mistakes, describing it as \"a musicological disaster of the first magnitude\", and continued to point out its errors in reviews of subsequent performances and recordings.\nIn the 1954 Grove he contributed an extended essay on 'criticism', ending with a long list of the necessary qualifications for a critic.However, Handel became his main focus; and apart from the book already mentioned, he also published Handel and the Opera Seria (Berkeley, 1969), and a more general Essays on Opera (Oxford, 1990, 2/1993). His definitive two-volume work on Handel operas was published in 1987 and 2006, and set new standards in Handel scholarship and did much to help the revival of stagings of Handel's operas.Dean contributed heavily to a number of musicological publications, including The Musical Times and Opera, as well as to The Listener and record sleeve notes.  His writings include studies of French Opera, and also Italian Opera before the dominance of Verdi. His reputation rests principally upon his analyses of Handel's output, and Handel\u2019s Dramatic Oratorios and Masques is widely acknowledged as a seminal work not only in Handel scholarship but also in musicology as a whole, thanks to its detailed discussion of original documents and thorough approach to the topic. He died in Hambledon, Surrey in December 2013 at the age of 97.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 19", "response": ["*2013 \u2013 Winton Dean, English musicologist and author (b. 1916)"]}, {"page": "George Frideric Handel", "response": ["Handel composed more than forty opera serias over a period of more than thirty years. Since the late 1960s, interest in Handel's music has grown. The musicologist Winton Dean wrote that \"Handel was not only a great composer; he was a dramatic genius of the first order.\" His music exerted a strong influence on Classical-era composers, including Mozart and Beethoven.", "In 1717 Handel became house composer at Cannons in Middlesex, where he laid the cornerstone for his future choral compositions in the Chandos Anthems. Romain Rolland wrote that these anthems (or Psalms) stood in relation to Handel's oratorios, much the same way that the Italian cantatas stood to his operas: \"splendid sketches of the more monumental works.\" Another work, which he wrote for The 1st Duke of Chandos, the owner of Cannons, was Acis and Galatea: during Handel's lifetime it was his most performed work. Winton Dean wrote, \"the music catches breath and disturbs the memory\"."]}, {"page": "Carmen", "response": ["With rehearsals due to begin in October 1873, Bizet began composing in or around January of that year, and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more. At that point, according to Bizet's biographer Winton Dean, \"some hitch at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique intervened\", and the project was suspended for a while.Dean 1965, p. 105 One reason for the delay may have been the difficulties in finding a singer for the title role. Another was a split that developed between the joint directors of the theatre, Camille du Locle and Adolphe de Leuven, over the advisability of staging the work. De Leuven had vociferously opposed the entire notion of presenting so risqu\u00e9 a story in what he considered a family theatre and was sure audiences would be frightened away. He was assured by Hal\u00e9vy that the story would be toned down, that Carmen's character would be softened, and offset by Mica\u00ebla, described by Hal\u00e9vy as \"a very innocent, very chaste young girl\". Furthermore, the gypsies would be presented as comic characters, and Carmen's death would be overshadowed at the end by \"triumphal processions, ballets and joyous fanfares\". De Leuven reluctantly agreed, but his continuing hostility towards the project led to his resignation from the theatre early in 1874.Curtiss, p. 351"]}, {"page": "Hector Berlioz", "response": ["Serious studies of Berlioz in the 20th century began with Adolphe Boschot's L'Histoire d'un romantique (three volumes, 1906\u20131913). His successors were Tom S. Wotton, author of a 1935 biography, and Julien Tiersot, who wrote numerous scholarly articles on Berlioz and began the collection and editing of the composer's letters, a process eventually completed in 2016, eighty years after Tiersot's death.Holoman (1975), pp. 57\u201358 In the early 1950s the best-known Berlioz scholar was Jacques Barzun, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wotton, and, like him, strongly hostile to many of Boschot's conclusions, which they saw as unfairly critical of the composer. Barzun's study was published in 1950. He was accused at the time by the musicologist Winton Dean of being excessively partisan, and refusing to admit failings and unevenness in Berlioz's music;Dean, pp. 122\u2013123 and 128\u2013129 more recently he has been credited by the musicologist Nicholas Temperley with playing a major part in improving the climate of musical opinion towards Berlioz.Holoman (1975), p. 59"]}, {"page": "Georges Bizet", "response": ["Since 1862, Bizet had been working intermittently on Ivan IV, an opera based on the life of Ivan the Terrible. Carvalho failed to deliver on his promise to produce it, so in December 1865, Bizet offered it to the Op\u00e9ra, which rejected it; the work remained unperformed until 1946.Dean (1965), p. 261 In July 1866, Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho, for La jolie fille de Perth, the libretto for which, by J.H. Vernoy de Saint-Georges after Sir Walter Scott, is described by Bizet's biographer Winton Dean as \"the worst Bizet was ever called upon to set\".Dean (1965), p. 62 Problems over the casting and other issues delayed its premiere for a year before it was finally performed by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique on 26 December 1867. Its press reception was more favourable than that for any of Bizet's other operas; Le M\u00e9nestral's critic hailed the second act as \"a masterpiece from beginning to end\".Dean (1965), pp. 71\u201372 Despite the opera's success, Carvalho's financial difficulties meant a run of only 18 performances.", "After Bizet's death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet. Even Carmen was altered into grand opera format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score. The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from Carmen and the L'Arl\u00e9sienne suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death. However, the 20th century saw increased interest. Don Procopio was revived in Monte Carlo in 1906; an Italian version of Les p\u00eacheurs de perles was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 13 November 1916, with Caruso in the leading tenor role, (Use Key word Search) and it has since become a staple at many opera houses.
