He did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work gradually achieved wider notice and recognition. Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and a student at the University of Cambridge. He released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. He recorded two more albums\u2014Bryter Layter (1971) and Pink Moon (1972). Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success. There is no known video footage of the adult Drake; he was only ever captured in still photographs and in home footage from his childhood.Drake suffered from depression, particularly during the latter part of his life, a fact often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, Drake died from an overdose of amitriptyline, a prescribed antidepressant; he was 26 years old. Whether his death was an accident or suicide has not been resolved.\nDrake's music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. By the mid-1980s, Drake was being credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith of The Cure and Peter Buck of R.E.M. In 1985, The Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \"Life in a Northern Town\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a certain type of \"doomed romantic\" musician in the UK music press and was frequently cited as an influence by artists including Kate Bush, Paul Weller, Aimee Mann, Beck, Robyn Hitchcock and The Black Crowes. Drake's first biography appeared in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 19", "response": ["*1948 \u2013 Nick Drake, English singer-songwriter (d. 1974)"]}, {"page": "John Martyn", "response": ["Released in 1971, Bless the Weather was Martyn's third solo album.

Echoes of Morrison's rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Elvis Costello\".

He was very quiet and withdrawn ... I think also that because he had an untimely death like Jimi Hendrix, he was never able to compromise his early work. He was never able to put a foot wrong. It's a morbid romanticism, but there is something attractive about that.\" It was not long afterwards that Robert Smith attended his first rock concert: Jimi Hendrix at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. At the age of 13 in 1972, Smith first saw David Bowie on television, performing \"Starman\" on Top of the Pops. He recalled, \"Every person in Britain who saw that performance, it's stuck with them. It's like Kennedy being shot for another generation. You just remember that night watching David Bowie on TV. It really was a formative, seminal experience.\" Smith said that the first LP he ever purchased with his pocket money was The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. According to Apter, Bowie also paved the way for Smith's love of glam rock bands such as Slade, The Sweet, and T. Rex, and during the same period, he also became a fan of Roxy Music. His parents maintained their supportive attitude: \"My mum and dad were encouraging us to talk [about] the records we liked. I remember staggering talks about Slade and Gary Glitter.\""]}, {"page": "Seventeen Seconds", "response": ["At the end of the Cure's 1979 UK tour supporting Siouxsie and the Banshees, Robert Smith spoke less and less with bassist Michael Dempsey. Early versions of \"Play for Today\" and \"M\" had been performed at a few concerts, but Dempsey did not like the new musical direction that Smith wanted to take. Smith commented: \"I think the final straw came when I played Michael the demos for the next album and he hated them. He wanted us to be XTC part 2 and \u2013 if anything \u2013 I wanted us to be the Banshees part 2. So he left\". Playing guitar with the Banshees for two months and learning their songs opened up another horizon to Smith. \"It allowed me to think beyond what we were doing. I wanted to have a band that does what Steven Severin and Budgie do, where they just get a bassline and the drum part and Siouxsie wails\". The records to which Smith was frequently listening during the composition of the album were Five Leaves Left by Nick Drake, Isle of Wight by Jimi Hendrix, Astral Weeks by Van Morrison and Low by David Bowie. Smith wrote the lyrics and music for most of the record at his parents' home, on a Hammond organ with a built-in tape recorder. Interviewed in 2004, producer Mike Hedges did not recall any demo tracks, with the band generally playing the track in the studio before laying down a backing track to which overdubs were added."]}, {"page": "1972 in music", "response": ["| Pink Moon || Nick Drake ||-"]}, {"page": "1969 in music", "response": ["| Five Leaves Left ||  Nick Drake ||-"]}, {"page": "1974 in music", "response": ["*November 25 \u2013 Nick Drake, singer/songwriter, 26 (overdose)"]}, {"page": "1948 in music", "response": ["*June 16 \u2013 Nick Drake, singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "Timeline of musical events", "response": ["***Nick Drake"]}, {"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Nick Drake"]}, {"page": "John Cale", "response": ["After leaving the Velvet Underground, Cale worked as a record producer and arranger on a number of albums, most notably the Stooges' highly influential 1969 self-titled debut and a trilogy by Nico, including The Marble Index (1969), Desertshore (1970) and The End...
