Here he was able to focus for the first time on teaching theology, and he was deeply influenced by his encounters with Anglicanism and with ecumenical worship. The three years at Oxford marked a creative and productive period in Jenson's career. In The Knowledge of Things Hoped For (1969), he sought to integrate the traditions of European hermeneutics and English analytical philosophy, while also drawing on patristic and medieval theologians such as Origen and Thomas Aquinas. And in God after God (1969), he sought to go beyond the \"death of God\" theology by emphasizing the actualism and futurity of God's being. The proposal advanced in God after God was in many respects parallel to the new \"theology of hope\" that was being developed at the time in Germany by young scholars like J\u00fcrgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg.
