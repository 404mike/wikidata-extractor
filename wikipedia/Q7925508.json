He was persuaded to stay when three of the club's top players left for Knowsley United, who had reconstituted as Liverpool Ladies. Edmunds drafted in youngsters Claire Utley from the youth team and Vicky Exley from Sheffield Wednesday, but injuries to key players saw the team limp to a third-place finish in the Premier Division. In summer 1995 Edmunds stood down to be replaced by Mel Woodhall. A fixture backlog at the end of season 1995\u201396 saw Croydon playing five games in ten days, winning four and drawing one to erode the Belles' 13-point lead and win the National Premier Division on goal difference. In March 1996 the Belles played Wembley in the Premier League Cup final. They conceded an injury-time penalty kick to draw 2\u20132 and then lost the penalty shootout."]}, {"page": "Sheffield Wednesday L.F.C.", "response": ["*  Vicky Exley"]}, {"page": "Vicky", "response": ["* Vicky Exley (born 1975), British former footballer"]}]}}
