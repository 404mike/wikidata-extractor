She was to arrive on 6 December but was delayed due to bad weather and the presence of a minefield. She arrived at the estuary a day late, surfacing  from the mouth of the river. The aim of the operation was for several canoes of marines to paddle 60 miles up the Gironde to attack German ships in Bordeaux; in the process of disembarking the canoes, one of the six canoes was damaged, leaving the submarine to return those marines while the remainder continued the assault. The operation was a success although only Corporal Bill Sparks and Major Herbert Hasler survived. The mission led to the formation of the Special Boat Service. For his superb navigation and coolness under pressure, Lieutenant-Commander Dick Raikes was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and was later immortalised on screen in the classic 1955 film The Cockleshell Heroes played by Christoper Lee."]}, {"page": "List of military figures by nickname", "response": ["**Herbert Hasler, Second World War Royal Marines officer"]}, {"page": "Bill King (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["Based on boats he had seen in China, the  schooner had a junk rig (a sail stiffened by battens).
