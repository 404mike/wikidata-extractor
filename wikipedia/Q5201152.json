As an ensign at the Battle of Dettingen, 1743, he reputedly saved the life of King George II, whose horse had bolted, and received a promotion as a reward. Trapaud was also present at the battles of Battle of Fontenoy, Falkirk and Culloden.In 1760, Trapaud was made a colonel in the 70th Regiment of Foot; he was promoted to major general in 1762, lieutenant general in 1772, and full general in 1783. He was Colonel of the 70th regiment from 1760 to 1778,  when he was transferred as Colonel to the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot. On his death in 1801, he was succeeded as Colonel by Sir John Moore.\n\nTrapaud was married to Catherine Plaistow, daughter of General Plaistow, in 1751. Her portrait was also painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds.  Copies of these, by Edward Fisher, are held by the National Portrait Gallery. Trapaud's brother was deputy Governor of Fort Augustus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1801", "response": ["* May 3 \u2013 Cyrus Trapaud, British Army general (b. 1715)"]}, {"page": "1715", "response": ["* August 18 \u2013 Cyrus Trapaud, British Army general (d. 1801)"]}, {"page": "John Moore (British Army officer)", "response": ["In 1799, he commanded a brigade in the Helder Expedition, with the campaign failing after the British and Russian forces failed to overcome entrenched Dutch defenders.

He was promoted to lieutenant in the 47th Foot in 1740 and to captain in Lord Loudon's Regiment in 1745. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, he was captured by Jacobite forces at the Battle of Prestonpans. Serving with his regiment in Flanders from 1747 until 1748, he received promotion to the rank of major in George Howard's Regiment of Foot on 17 February 1749, replacing Cyrus Trapaud, who was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the same regiment. Mackay became a lieutenant-colonel in Hedworth Lambton's Regiment of Foot on 18 December 1755. Mackay served out much of the Seven Years' War in Ireland, where he raised his own regiment in 1762. In the summer of 1768 he was appointed to command British forces sent to keep the peace in Boston, Massachusetts. Owing to a rough crossing of the Atlantic that necessitated a stop-over in the West Indies, he did not arrive to take up the post until April 1769. Perturbed by the rising opposition to the imposition of customs duties in North America and by the need to look after his private affairs in England he received permission from Thomas Gage, commander of British forces, to relinquish his command in August 1769."]}]}}
