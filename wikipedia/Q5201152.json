As an ensign at the Battle of Dettingen, 1743, he reputedly saved the life of King George II, whose horse had bolted, and received a promotion as a reward. Trapaud was also present at the battles of Battle of Fontenoy, Falkirk and Culloden.In 1760, Trapaud was made a colonel in the 70th Regiment of Foot; he was promoted to major general in 1762, lieutenant general in 1772, and full general in 1783. He was Colonel of the 70th regiment from 1760 to 1778,  when he was transferred as Colonel to the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot. On his death in 1801, he was succeeded as Colonel by Sir John Moore.\n\nTrapaud was married to Catherine Plaistow, daughter of General Plaistow, in 1751. Her portrait was also painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds.  Copies of these, by Edward Fisher, are held by the National Portrait Gallery. Trapaud's brother was deputy Governor of Fort Augustus.", "link_mentions": {}}}
