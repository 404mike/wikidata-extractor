He was no doubt his father's pupil.  Next to nothing seems to be known about his activities or compositions, yet he was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1834, by King William IV, succeeding Christopher (or Christian) Kramer, who was no relation.\nThe king died in 1837, and Cramer continued as Master of the Queen's Musick to Queen Victoria.  He did not contribute any music to her coronation, leading The Spectator to complain that he had been allowed \"to proclaim to the world his inability to discharge the first, and the most grateful duty of his office \u2014 the composition of a Coronation Anthem\".He died in 1848 aged 76, and was succeeded by George Frederick Anderson.\nThe only composition of Cramer's that has survived is a Capriccio (Album Leaf) for violin, which is in manuscript in the British Museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Master of the Queen's Music", "response": ["Parsons held the post of Master until 1817, when he was succeeded by William Shield, best known as a theatre composer: he composed or arranged music for at least thirty-six operas and seven pantomimes and ballets.Legge, R. H. \"Shield, William (bap. 1748/9, d. 1829)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004, retrieved 27 May 2015  Shield's tenure is most notable for the abandonment of the traditional provision of court odes. By custom, the Poet Laureate of the day wrote the words for the odes, a task that the then holder, Robert Southey, found uncongenial. After the death of George III in 1820 the odes were discontinued. The post of Master of the King's Musick continued because George IV maintained the traditional small orchestra, which Shield's successor, Christian Kramer, directed. That remained the chief function of the Master through the tenures of Franz Cramer (Master 1834\u201348), George Frederick Anderson (Master 1848\u201370), and Sir William Cusins (Master 1870\u201393).
