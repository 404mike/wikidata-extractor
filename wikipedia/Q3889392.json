His grandfather, Edward Onslow Ford, was a Victorian sculptor. At the age of 11, he began painting landscapes under the guidance of his uncle. Following the death of his father at age 14, he was sent to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. The ocean affected him deeply and his early works depicted ocean scenes. The metaphor of taking a \"voyage\" later became an important aspect of his paintings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dartmouth, Devon", "response": ["* Gordon Onslow Ford (1912\u20132003), a leading British surrealist painter, attended the Royal Naval College."]}, {"page": "November 9", "response": ["*  2003   \u2013 Gordon Onslow Ford, English-American painter (b. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Surrealism", "response": ["From 1936 through 1938 Wolfgang Paalen, Gordon Onslow Ford, and Roberto Matta joined the group.

Ouspensky, Helena Blavatsky, Meister Eckhart and the Sufis, and was as fascinated with the legend of the Holy Grail as with sacred geometry, witchcraft, alchemy and the I Ching. Ramos described her beliefs about her own powers of witchcraft in a letter to English author Gerald Gardner, \"Personally, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m endowed with any special powers, but instead with an ability to see relationships of cause and effect quickly, and this beyond the ordinary limits of common logic.\" In 1938 and 1939 Varo joined her closest companions Frances, Roberto Matta and Gordon Onslow Ford in exploring the fourth dimension, basing much of their studies off of Ouspensky's book Tertium Oganum. The books Illustrated Anthology of Sorcery, Magic and Alchemy by Grillot de Givry and The History of Magic and the Occult by Kurt Seligmann were highly valued in Breton's Surrealist circle. She saw in each of these an avenue to self-knowledge and the transformation of consciousness."]}, {"page": "Wolfgang Paalen", "response": ["In autumn 1939 he organized the International Surrealist Exhibition in the Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano together with the Peruvian poet C\u00e9sar Moro, which opened in January 1940 in the new gallery rooms of Ines Amor. In April 1940 he showed his great Fumages and new experimental work, close to abstraction, in New York at Julien Levy gallery with great success. Reporters witness that Paalen at a certain point switched out the light and walked around with a burning candle during the opening, gathered by young American painters such as Jackson Pollock, Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell, William Baziotes and Gerome Kamrowski.Neufert, p. 420 Neither in Mexico, nor in New York he came in contact to Leon Trotsky or his assistant Jean van Heijenoort (who then was living in New York), albeit the commendatory letter, Breton had written already in Paris, hoping that Paalen would continue the contact, he had established during his trip to Mexico in 1938. Paalen justified his refusal in a letter to Breton with his general critique on the pseudo-religious paternal fixations of the Surrealists who, in his opinion, didn\u00b4t dispose of the means to find other ways out of the spiritual hole, the crisis of Marxism has left in their minds, than to look for new political fathers.see Neufert, p. 387ff., citing from the letters Paalen wrote to Breton f.e. Wolfgang Paalen to Andr\u00e9 Breton, Mai 3rd, 1940 (Biblioth\u00e8que Doucet, Paris) Back in Mexico he broke up with his former friends Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo across political opinions concerning their hard line in communism after the assassination of Leon Trotsky and their return to an open adoration of Joseph Stalin. More and more isolated from the Mexican intellectual leftists, he held an open household for European and American visitors, such as Roberto Matta, Robert Motherwell, Gordon Onslow Ford, Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Remedios Varo, Esteban Franc\u00e9s as well as refugees from the stalinist terror, like Gustav Regler and Victor Serge. He helped to organize immigration visas for the surrealists in Vichy-France through the Union Mexico-Francia and Julien Levy. During his first period of exile, Paalen concentrated on the verbalization of his ideas on art and, apart from occasional visits to New York, experimented secretly, in his studio in San \u00c1ngel, in a new style on pictorial space.", "In 1948, one of the two children from Luchita's former marriage died in Mexico of Polio. Paalen decided to move to San Francisco with his new family, where he worked with Gordon Onslow Ford and Lee Mullican in a newly formed association, the Dynaton group. They settled in Mill Valley and had solo shows in the San Francisco Museum of Art as well as a group show at Stanford University Art Gallery, where he also lectured parts from the major essay on his new concept of space, he had worked on the last years. It was published in occasion of the DYNATON exhibition in San Francisco Museum of Art in 1951 as a catalogue.Wolfgang Paalen, Metaplastic, Relativity of Measure and Theory of the Dynaton, San Francisco Museum of Art, 1951 Paalen's ongoing desire to go back to Mexico and rebuilt the link to Breton in Paris led to a divorce from Luchita, who decided to live with Lee Mullican. ", "Paalen's last years in Mexico were characterized by increasing health problems, mainly originated in his bipolar (manic-depressive) disposition. With the help of his friends and patrons Eva Sulzer and Gordon Onslow Ford he acquired an old house with studio in the small town Tepoztl\u00e1n in Morelos, where he mainly lived and worked during the last years of his life. Paradoxically Paalen produced a number of masterly works towards the end of this last period, as well as theatre plays and short stories, which reflect his ambivalent state of mind and growing depressions. His passion for Olmec sculpture and artefacts implicated him into adventurous expeditions into the wilderness of Yucat\u00e1n, collecting and trading pre-Columbian art to an always growing US market. Rumours of Paalen having been involved in illegal looting of archaeological sites in Yucat\u00e1n inspired the American author and theologian Arthur A. Cohen to his novel Acts of Theft (1980). As expert and inspirator Wolfgang Paalen assisted the American filmmaker Albert Lewin for his film The Living Idol.The Living Idol, Mexico/USA 1956, with Steve Forrest and Liliane Montevecchi 1958 he received Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues and Octavio Paz in Tepoztl\u00e1n, who both wrote texts on Paalen after his suicide.Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues, La mort volontaire, in: La Nouvelle Revue fran\u00e7aise (Dec. 1959), No. 84Octavio Paz, Pr\u00e9face \u00e0 une exposition, in: Catalogue of the memorial exhibition of Wolfgang Paalens in Librairie Loil\u00e9e, Paris 1960 In the night of September 25, 1959 Paalen left his hotel room in the Hacienda San Francisco Cuadra in Taxco, where he sometimes stayed during his depressions, and walked up the hill. The following day he was found dead with a gunshot to his head.Neufert (2015), p. 23, 611", "The complete works of Paalen, canvases, objects and sculptures, were catalogued by art historian Andreas Neufert in his 1999 book Wolfgang Paalen: Im Inneren des Wals: Monography, and Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9.Paalen, W.

The estate which Paalen left in the care of his close friend, the surrealist painter Gordon Onslow Ford, is administrated by the Lucid Art Foundation in Inverness, California, which recently restituted Paalen's rich archive of papers, photographs and manuscripts to the heirs of Eva Sulzer, Paalen's only heir and executor.The Succession Wolfgang Paalen et Eva Sulzer is administrated by their fiduciary Andreas Neufert who also deals with all questions of copyright.", "*  Kloyber, Christian, ed.
