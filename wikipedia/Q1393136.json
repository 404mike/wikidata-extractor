One of the earliest important discoveries (suggested by Richard Dixon Oldham in 1906 and definitively shown by Harold Jeffreys in 1926) was that the outer core of the earth is liquid.  Since S-waves do not pass through liquids, the liquid core causes a \"shadow\" on the side of the planet opposite the earthquake where no direct S-waves are observed.  In addition, P-waves travel much slower through the outer core than the mantle."]}, {"page": "Seismic wave", "response": ["When an earthquake occurs, seismographs near the epicenter are able to record both P and S waves, but those at a greater distance no longer detect the high frequencies of the first S wave.  Since shear waves cannot pass through liquids, this phenomenon was original evidence for the now well-established observation that the Earth has a liquid outer core, as demonstrated by Richard Dixon Oldham.  This kind of observation has also been used to argue, by seismic testing, that the Moon has a solid core, although recent geodetic studies suggest the core is still molten."]}, {"page": "Inge Lehmann", "response": ["*Richard Dixon Oldham"]}, {"page": "Archimedes Palimpsest", "response": ["The board illustrated here, as also by Netz, is one proposed by Heinrich Suter in translating an unpointed Arabic text in which twice and equals are easily confused; Suter makes at least a typographical error at the crucial point, equating the lengths of a side and diagonal, in which case the board cannot be a rectangle. But, as the diagonals of a square intersect at right angles, the presence of right triangles makes the first proposition of Archimedes' Ostomachion immediate. Rather, the first proposition sets up a board consisting of two squares side by side (as in Tangram). A reconciliation of the Suter board with this Codex board was published by Richard Dixon Oldham, FRS, in Nature in March, 1926, sparking an Ostomachion craze that year."]}, {"page": "List of geophysicists", "response": ["* Richard Dixon Oldham (British, 1858\u20131936) \u2013 seismologist, first clear evidence for separate arrivals of P-waves, S-waves and surface waves on seismograms; first clear evidence for Earth's core"]}, {"page": "1900 in science", "response": ["* Richard Dixon Oldham distinguishes between primary, secondary and tertiary waveforms as recorded by seismometers.

Thus, the Geological Survey commenced to map the rock types, geological structures and relative ages of different rock types . The age of rock strata was estimated from the presence of index fossils, which consumed much of the geologists' efforts in finding these index fossils, as the method of Radiometric dating for estimating the age of rock strata was not developed at that time. In 1869 Frederick Richard Mallet was first to visit Ramgarh crater.Mallet, F. R., 1869, Memoir, Geological Survey of India, vol 7, page 129.BALASUNDARAM, M., DUBE, A.
