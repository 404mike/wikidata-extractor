Over the summer he signed goalkeeper Glenn Morris, defenders Olly Lancashire and Guy Branston, and midfielders Craig Stanley and Harry Cooksley. Holdsworth targeted the play-offs for the 2012\u201313 season, though said that \"our aim is, first and foremost, staying in the division.\" Over the course of the season he also added Sonny Bradley (on loan), Danny Rose (on loan), Kieron Cadogan, Oliver Risser, Asa Hall (on loan), and Anthony McNamee to his squad. He led Aldershot to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup for the first time in the club's history. On 20 February 2013 he was sacked by Aldershot, three days after his twin brother David Holdsworth was sacked as manager of Lincoln City, and one day after Aldershot recorded a 1\u20130 victory over Torquay United.

Benyon had been one of Paul Buckle's first signings when he took over at Plainmoor in 2007, and had now developed into Torquay's main goal threat.  As such he had been tracked by several clubs over a number of months and his eventual move had been seen as inevitable by the majority of Gulls fans.  The last day of the window also saw the transfer of Nicky Wroe to Shrewsbury and the cancellation of Ashley Hemmings\u2019 loan deal with Wolves.  In their place came striker Jake Robinson and midfielder Craig Stanley on loan deals from Shrewsbury and Morecambe respectively.  With a new-look squad and just the league to concentrate on, Torquay had to now put an ultimately disheartening month behind them and look to the future.", "With Torquay now having to wait for a decision on any punishment from the FA, the club had to make the most of a busy February schedule which included a further six League Two encounters following the disastrous Hereford game.  The first three were against teams battling relegation and the Gulls took full advantage, grabbing maximum points against struggling Stockport, Barnet and Burton Albion.  These matches saw Paul Buckle begin to experiment with his squad selection with second choice keeper Danny Potter being brought in to give Scott Bevan a well-deserved break and left back Lathaniel Rowe-Turner deputising for the ever-present Kevin Nicholson.  Both players rewarded the manager's faith with Potter keeping clean sheets in his first three games and Rowe-Turner scoring on his first league start of the season against Barnet.  With loan players Jake Robinson and Craig Stanley fitting seamlessly into the new-look squad, Torquay were further enhanced by another loan signing in Northampton midfielder Ryan Gilligan.", "Easter Monday's trip to Burton saw Torquay find their shooting boots again with Chris Zebroski and Gavin Tomlin putting the Gulls 2\u20130 up within the first 15 minutes.  However, not for the first time this season, Torquay managed to surrender a two-goal lead and had to rely on a stunning 78th-minute strike from Billy Kee to rescue a point in a thrilling 3\u20133 draw.  This was a result which left Torquay just outside the play-offs with two games remaining.  The penultimate game of the league campaign was a Friday night encounter at home to champions-elect Chesterfield.  Over 5,000 supporters witnessed yet another 0\u20130 draw which was also Craig Stanley's last game before having to return to parent club Morecambe.  Stanley was perhaps one of Paul Buckle's most successful loan signings and many Gulls fans were hopeful that the midfielder would make a return to Plainmoor next season.  The significance of the Chesterfield draw was only fully felt the following day with Gillingham and Stevenage both losing their matches.  This meant all three teams would go into the final day of the season tied on 68 points with just two play-off spots remaining, although Torquay's superior goal difference left them in pole position.  The Gulls now had to travel to Rotherham knowing they only had to equal or better the Gillingham and Stevenage results in order to guarantee a place in the play-offs.", "Top of Ling's list of priorities was to start building a new team.  With players reaching the end of their contracts and loan players returning to their parent clubs, the squad was now starting to look rather threadbare.  Several key players who had got Torquay to the play-off final would definitely not be at the club for the new season.  Player of the year, Guy Branston made a move to Bradford City while Scott Bevan decided to join Paul Buckle at Bristol Rovers.  Torquay fans were also disappointed to see midfielder Craig Stanley, who had been particularly impressive for the Gulls on his loan spell from Morecambe, also follow Buckle to the Memorial Stadium.  Meanwhile, another loan player who would not be returning to Plainmoor was Jake Robinson who agreed to join Northampton Town instead.", "|= || MF ||  || 6 || Craig Stanley || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|6 ||  || MF || Craig Stanley || 5 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 5 || 0", "|Craig Stanley"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Craig Stanley", "| Craig Stanley"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["*  \u2013 Bristol Rovers sign midfielder Craig Stanley from Morecambe.", "| Craig Stanley", "|align=\"left\"|6||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Craig Stanley", "|  Craig Stanley"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["| Craig Stanley"]}, {"page": "List of sportspeople with diabetes", "response": ["*Craig Stanley, Lincoln City (2015\u20132017), midfielder, type 1."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["*  \u2013 Craig Stanley's contract at Rovers was terminated by mutual consent.", "|Craig Stanley"]}, {"page": "Craig Stanley", "response": ["Craig Stanley may refer to:", "* Craig Stanley (footballer) (born 1983), English footballer", "* Craig Stanley (cricketer) (born 1971), former English cricketer", "* Craig Stanley (Home and Away), fictional character on Australian soap opera Home and Away"]}]}}
