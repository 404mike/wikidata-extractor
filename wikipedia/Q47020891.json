Much of what we know about that hurricane's impact on the Territory come from contemporaneous written records and photographs by his wife, Agnes.He was later appointed as Governor of Singapore prison.Captain Hancock and his wife were both killed at sea on 14 February 1942 off the coast of Singapore, together with their son (also named Otho, an officer in the RAF).  Records indicated that on the last day of fighting before fall of Singapore they were on the vessel, the S.S. Kuala at dock in Pom Pong Island whilst evacuating from Singapore, when it was bombed.
