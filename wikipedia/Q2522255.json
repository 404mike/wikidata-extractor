Emma disapproved of Hardy's last novel because of the book's criticisms of religion and because she worried that the reading public would believe the relationship between Jude and Sue paralleled her strained relationship with Hardy. Emma and Hardy spent more and more time apart, and he began seeing other women, such as Florence Dugdale, companion to Lady Stoker, sister-in-law of Bram Stoker, author of Dracula. Hardy portrays Florence in various poems such as \"On the Departure Platform\". In 1899, Emma became a virtual recluse and spent much of her time in attic rooms, which she asked Thomas Hardy to build for her and she called 'my sweet refuge and solace.'."]}, {"page": "Florence Emily Hardy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Florence Dugdale"]}, {"page": "The Unconquerable", "response": ["In the only known typescript copy of the text of \"The Unconquerable\", authorship of the story is accredited to F.
