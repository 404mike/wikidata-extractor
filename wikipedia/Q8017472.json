He earned his Victoria Cross as a pilot in the Royal Air Force Bomber Command during the Second World War.\nBorn in Baillieston, Lanarkshire, he applied to join the RAF on the outbreak of war.  After initial training, he was selected as a bomber pilot, and soon became a flying instructor himself.  He was eventually given an operational posting, flying several raids before that on D\u00fcsseldorf which led to the award of the VC.  On a later raid he was shot down and became a prisoner of war in Germany.  He left the RAF after the war, and worked in the agricultural industry.\nOn 19 November 2009 his VC was sold at auction for \u00a3384,000, a record for a VC awarded to a recipient from the United Kingdom.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 28", "response": ["*  2001   \u2013 William Reid, Scottish lieutenant and pilot, Victoria Cross recipient (b. 1921)"]}, {"page": "Avro Lancaster", "response": ["* Flight Lieutenant William Reid"]}, {"page": "Crieff", "response": ["*William Reid (VC) (1921\u20132001) recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "1943 in aviation", "response": ["* November 1\u20132 (overnight) \u2013 627 British bombers attack D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, with the loss of 20 aircraft.
