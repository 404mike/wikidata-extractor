However, he never played in a competitive fixture for Everton, and joined Mansfield on a free transfer in March 1983. He made his debut for the Stags on 19 March 1983 against Colchester United. He was a versatile player who could play on the left wing, as left-back or in midfield. He also became Mansfield's penalty-taker when John Dungworth left the club in 1984.\nHe was a member of the Mansfield side that got promoted from Division Four in 1986, and he was also a member of the side that won the Freight Rover Trophy at Wembley in 1987. As the club's regular penalty-taker, Kearney scored the first goal in the penalty shootout, and also scored the winning goal from the penalty spot when Mansfield won against Middlesbrough in the quarter-final of the same competition.In total, Kearney played 303 first-team games and scored 37 goals for Mansfield before leaving the club to join Bury in January 1991. He spent three years at Gigg Lane, playing just over a hundred games for the club before being released on a free transfer at the end of the 1993-94 season. He then joined non-league Telford United, who were managed by his former Mansfield teammate George Foster, as player-coach, spending three seasons at Telford before retiring from football in 1997.\nSince his retirement from football, Kearney has had coaching jobs at Mansfield, Shrewsbury Town, Northampton Town and Derby County.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stuart Watkiss", "response": ["Watkiss remained at Mansfield Town as youth team coach taking over from Tony Ford, producing at least ten players who progressed into the first team during his three years in charge of the club's youth set-up. In June 2001, assistant manager Mark Kearney left to join Northampton Town as youth team coach. Speculation mounted that Watkiss would step up to assistant manager. Watkiss told the press \"I do feel that the job would be a natural progression for me. A lot of the lads who have come up through the club were with me and I would like the chance to work with them again.\" A few of weeks later, the club's official website revealed that \"the worst kept secret in the club's history had been confirmed\", and Watkiss was promoted to assistant manager. Manager Billy Dearden explained, \"I gave the position a lot of thought and have decided that Stuart is the best man for the job. He is a young coach who could go a long way in the game. He is at the right age to work with me, and it is a huge reward for him. He has done an excellent job with the youth team and it was a huge wrench to take him away from the youth team.\" Watkiss said \"I am confident in my ability, I wouldn\u2019t have gone for the job if not. Obviously time will tell if I am a success or not, but I am cautiously optimistic. It will be great working with Bill Dearden. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience within the game and I will be watching and learning all the time.\""]}, {"page": "1987 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["||MF ||11 ||Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "Kearney, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1991 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Bolton's opponents for their play-off semi-final were Bury and the first match of the two-legged tie took place at Gigg Lane in Bury on 19 May 1991.  Shortly before half-time, Alan Stubbs fouled Bury's David Lee, conceding a penalty; taking it himself, Lee scored his 16th goal of the season.  In the 60th minute, Mark Kearney brought down Bolton's Steve Thompson and Tony Philliskirk scored the subsequent penalty, equalising the score with his 27th goal of the season.  The game ended 1\u20131; Derek Potter of The Guardian suggested that \"there could hardly have been a more evenly balanced match\".  The second leg was played three days later at Burnden Park in Bolton.  The match was even once again, but Bolton took the lead just before half-time: after Bury failed to clear a corner, Philliskirk struck the ball past Gary Kelly.  Both Mark Seagraves and Stuart Storer made goal-line clearances to preserve Bolton's clean sheet and 1\u20130 win; they progressed to the final with a 2\u20131 aggregate victory."]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Kearney"]}, {"page": "Kearney (surname)", "response": ["* Mark Kearney (born 1962), English footballer"]}]}}
