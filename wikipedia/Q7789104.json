An effective frigate captain he made a number of small captures, but did not see action in any major fleet clashes, until he was present at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. He played an important role in relaying signals before the battle, and in towing dismasted British ships to safety afterwards. He had a largely uneventful career thereafter, rising through the ranks and eventually dying a vice-admiral.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Dundas", "response": ["Thomas Dundas may refer to:", "* Thomas Dundas (of Fingask and Carronhall) (died 1786), MP for Orkney and Shetland", "* Thomas Dundas, 1st Baron Dundas (1741\u20131820), British politician", "* Thomas Dundas (British Army officer) (1750\u20131794), governor of Guadaloupe", "* Thomas Dundas (Royal Navy officer) (c.1765\u20131841), British naval officer of the Napoleonic Wars", "* Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland (1795\u20131873), British nobleman and politician", "* Thomas Dundas (High Sheriff) of Sussex"]}, {"page": "Battle of the Basque Roads", "response": ["Assuming that the French fleet had sailed from Brest, Stopford sent the frigate HMS Naiad under Thomas Dundas to warn Gambier.

On 17 July, the squadron outran and captured the British corvette or sloop-of-war , rated as 16 guns but actually carrying 24. Ranger's crew had observed the approaching French squadron from some distance, and Commander Charles Coote had ordered that once their capture was inevitable, the crew were to cause as much damage as possible to their vessel to deny its use to the French. So successful were these efforts that Allemand was forced to burn Ranger once her crew had been removed as prisoners of war. Allemand subsequently reached his first station, off The Lizard, the day after capturing Ranger. There he waited in vain for the fleet under Ganteaume, which had never departed Brest. Following his instructions, Allemand then sailed for the Bay of Biscay, where he was to meet the fleet under Villeneuve that had been ordered north to join with Ganteaume. He passed southwards during July and was in the region of Cape Finisterre on 22 July: later records show that he was close enough to the site of the Battle of Cape Finisterre to have participated in the engagement if he had been aware that it was under way.Clowes, p. 118 News of Allemand's presence reached Villeneuve early in August and on 5 August he despatched the frigate  in search of the Rochefort squadron. Didon was followed on 9 August by the main fleet, including 29 ships of the line and associated frigates and corvettes. Villeneuve passed up the Spanish coast, anchoring off the village of Zerez, near Ferrol, on 10 August and departing the following day in a west by northwest direction. On 13 August the fleet was spotted by the frigates  under Captain Edward Brace and  under Captain Thomas Dundas, who were forced to flee a French detachment sent in pursuit, losing sight of the enemy on 14 August as Villeneuve's main force continued to the northwest.James, Vol. 4, p. 17"]}, {"page": "Battle of Les Sables-d'Olonne", "response": ["At dawn on 24 February, near the \u00cele de R\u00e9, Amelia closed on Cyb\u00e8le, forcing the other French frigates to fall back in support and open fire, driving the pursuers back.Woodman, p. 265 As Irby dropped off, sails appeared to the south.
