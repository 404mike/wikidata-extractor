Granada's hospitality arm was at its strongest in the 1990s under Gerry Robinson's chairmanship of the group. At one time the company owned and operated 75% of the motorway service areas. It expanded into other areas of catering, including most notably the acquisition in 1996 of Forte Group.Granada buys maximum stake This included rival operator Welcome Break (later sold due to regulations), roadside chains Little Chef and Happy Eater, and Forte's hotels (including Travelodge and Le M\u00e9ridien)."]}, {"page": "London Weekend Television", "response": ["From 1993, LWT's low bid made it attractive to others wishing to take it over.
