He made only a handful of appearances for the Imps, and joined Hartlepool in October 1976, where he made his debut in a Division Four match against Colchester United. During his 18-month spell at Hartlepool, Wiggett played 60 matches for the club, and scored one goal. On 23 March 1978 Wiggett was killed in a car crash. He was a passenger in a car driven by his Hartlepool teammate Bob Newton.[1][2]\nTwo days after the crash, a minute of silence was observed before Hartlepool's away match against arch-rivals Darlington. Allegedly, sections of the Darlington crowd chanted throughout the minute of silence, and what followed was a very bad-tempered match Hartlepool eventually won 2\u20131. Following the match, Hartlepool manager Billy Horner, himself a former Darlington player, called the offending Darlo fans \"a disgrace to their club, their town, and the human race\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Ken Hale took over and guided the team to 13th and 14th over the next two seasons and also reached the League Cup Fourth round in 1974\u201375 (still a club record). However, 1976\u201377 saw a return to the doldrums; Hale was sacked after failing to win any of the first nine games (including two cup matches) at the start of October. His successor Billy Horner could not stop the rot either, and the team finished in 22nd place. Again there was a strong challenger from non-league in the form of Wimbledon; however, as the club was seeking re-election for the first time in six years, it was Workington \u2013 bottom for a second successive year and making their fourth consecutive re-election application that made way. Over the close season the team's name was changed to its current form of Hartlepool United.
