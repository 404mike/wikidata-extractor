He played as a centre half in the Football League for Middlesbrough and in the Southern League for Brighton & Hove Albion and Watford. He went on to manage Watford for 16 years, leading them to a Southern League Championship in the 1914\u201315 season, and into the Football League for the first time in 1920.\nDescribed as 'a man of few words' by the Watford Observer, Kent never smoked, drank or swore. A 'model professional' as a player, he was well respected by his players as a manager. When coaching his team Kent insisted on high fitness levels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Watford F.C.", "response": ["The club recognises its foundation as 1881, aligned with that of its antecedent, Watford Rovers, and was established as Watford Football Club in 1898. After finishing the 1914\u201315 season as Southern League champions under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920. The team played at several grounds in their early history, including what is now West Herts Sports Club, before moving to Vicarage Road in 1922. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Luton Town.", "Following relegation to the Southern League Second Division in 1903, Watford appointed its first manager \u2013 former England international and First Division top scorer John Goodall. He led Watford to promotion, and kept the team in the division until his departure in 1910. Despite financial constraints, Watford won the Southern League title in the 1914\u201315 season under his successor, Harry Kent. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the Southern League during the First World War \u2013 after finishing the 1919\u201320 season runners-up on goal average, the club resigned from the Southern League to join the new Football League Third Division.Jones 1996, p. 267.", "Watford's team was selected by committee until 1903, when former England international John Goodall was appointed player-manager. The impact was immediate, as Watford secured promotion to the Southern League First Division in 1903\u201304. Goodall retired as a player in 1907, and left the club in 1910. He was replaced by his former captain, Harry Kent, who become known for his financial management of the club; under Kent, Watford frequently made a profit in the transfer market.Phillips 1991, pp. 38\u201341. Kent led the club to the Southern League title in 1914\u201315, and missed out on a second title in 1919\u201320 on goal average, before resigning in 1926. His three immediate successors \u2013 Fred Pagnam, Neil McBain and Bill Findlay \u2013 all played for Watford before and during the early part of their managerial tenures. None were able to lead the team to promotion from the Third Division South, although Findlay did lead Watford to a Third Division South Cup win in 1937."]}, {"page": "Jack Hall (footballer, born 1883)", "response": ["In April 1908, Hall signed for Middlesbrough for a \u00a3700 fee. At the time, there was a \u00a3350 cap on transfer fees, so clubs evaded the problem by including a second player as a makeweight in the deal, valuing him at the difference between \u00a3350 and the fee required. The makeweight in this case was Harry Kent, a centre-half who played only six times for Middlesbrough before returning to the Southern League with Watford. Middlesbrough were nevertheless fined \u00a3100 over the transaction, as Hall's Football League registration was still held by Stoke. Hall was Middlesbrough's top scorer in both the seasons with that club, in 1908\u201309 and 1909\u201310."]}, {"page": "History of Watford F.C.", "response": ["West Hertfordshire joined the Southern Football League in 1896, and started to turn professional the following year. In 1898, they merged with Watford St Mary's to become Watford Football Club. That same year, the club moved on to a ground in Cassio Road. Pressure from the owner eventually forced the manager, Harry Kent, to look for a new permanent ground which he found in 1914 at Vicarage Road, the club's home today. However, they remained at Cassio Road for a further eight years.Notes from a lecture on the club's history given by Edmund Coan, former club press officer, to the Kings Langley Historical Society on 21 January 2009. Reported in the Hemel Gazette 25 February 2009. Watford won the Southern League title in 1914\u201315, and missed out on retaining their title in 1919\u201320 on goal average. Along with the rest of the division, Watford left the Southern League in 1920, becoming founder members of the Football League Third Division."]}, {"page": "List of Watford F.C. players", "response": ["Many of Watford's individual records are held by former centre forward Luther Blissett. He has made more Watford appearances (503, including substitute appearances) and scored more goals for the club (186) than anyone else. His corresponding totals in the Football League (415 appearances and 148 goals) are also Watford records. Cliff Holton has scored the most goals for Watford in a single season; 48 in all competitions in the 1959\u201360 season, including 42 in the Football League.Jones, The Watford Football Clubs Illustrated Who's Who. p. 123. Eddie Mummery's five-goal haul against Newport County on 5 January 1924 is the club record for goals scored by a player in a Football League match. Watford's most-used goalkeeper is Skilly Williams, who played for the club 341 times between 1913 and 1926. John Barnes and Kenny Jackett share the record for the most international caps won while playing for Watford. Barnes made his first 31 England appearances before transferring from Watford to Liverpool in 1987. Jackett, a one-club man, made the same number of appearances for Wales. Seven people have played competitively for the club while managing them: John Goodall, Harry Kent, Fred Pagnam, Neil McBain, Bill Findlay, Ken Furphy, and most recently Mike Keen between 1973 and 1975.Jones, The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who. pp. 267\u2013274."]}]}}
