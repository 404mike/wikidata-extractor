It was after the Assembly came to be established in 1999, which their members opposed, that they adjusted to becoming more of a Welsh orientated party. Their first leader, the former Welsh Office Minister Rod Richards, showed a combative style of politics against the Labour government. Richards subsequently resigned shortly after the Assembly had become established in response to allegations of an assault, from which he was later cleared. Nicholas Bourne, a law professor and former leader of the No campaign in the Welsh Assembly referendum then became the leader, in an election that was unopposed. From 1999 to 2007 the party remained firmly in opposition in Wales, opposed to forming an alliance with other political parties. This changed in 2007 when the Welsh Conservatives were briefly involved in coalition talks after the indecisive 2007 election on a \"rainbow coalition\" with the Welsh Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru which collapsed after the Liberal Democrats backed out. Plaid Cymru ruled itself out of having a coalition with the Conservatives on an ideological basis. Plaid Cymru and Labour eventually formed the government under the terms of their One Wales agreement. As a result of the agreement, the Conservatives, the largest opposition party, became the Official Opposition in the Welsh Assembly."]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Rod Richards; MP for Clwyd North West (1992\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|Rod Richards"]}, {"page": "Philip Pedley", "response": ["In 1998, Pedley backed the winning candidate Rod Richards in the postal ballot for the leadership for Welsh Conservatives.Thomas Quinn, Electing and Ejecting Party Leaders in Britain, "]}, {"page": "Members of the 1st National Assembly for Wales", "response": ["* Rod Richards"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 2010s", "response": ["|Rod Richards"]}, {"page": "Second Major ministry", "response": ["| Rod Richards"]}, {"page": "Regional Member changes to the Senedd", "response": ["|Rod Richards"]}, {"page": "List of members of the Senedd", "response": ["|Rod Richards"]}, {"page": "Fairwater (Cardiff electoral ward)", "response": ["During the 2008 election campaign former MP Rod Richards, who lived in Fairwater, was arrested after assaulting a fellow Conservative Party campaigner."]}, {"page": "2019 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Rod Richards, 72, Welsh politician, MP for Clwyd North West (1992\u20131997), Leader of the Welsh Conservative Party (1999), cancer."]}, {"page": "2019 in Wales", "response": ["*13 July \u2013 Rod Richards, politician, 72"]}]}}
