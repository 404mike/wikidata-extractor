The Killen-Strait tractor was one of the few vehicles available, and the demonstration was attended by Churchill, Minister of Munitions David Lloyd George,  Lord Grosvenor, Director of Munitions Supply Sir Frederick Black, Maj Gen Ivor Philipps, Major Geneneral George Kenneth Scott-Moncrieff, Colonel Henry Holden and Head of Trench Warfare at the Ministry of Munitions Louis Jackson. The vehicle was driven by Thomas Gerard Hetherington into tensioned barbed wire, across dummy shell holes and small piles of railway sleepers. The vehicle demonstrated good mobility but was not able to breakthrough the barbed wire. After a short while, Lt Kenneth Symes fitted the turretless armoured bodywork from a Delaunay-Belleville armoured car onto the vehicle, creating the first tracked armoured vehicle. It was envisioned for this vehicle to join the RNAS Armoured Car Section, but this was not realized due to the unit's imminent disbandment. The vehicle was transferred to the RNAS Barrow Airship Station in September 1915, serving as a tow tractor there. The project itself was also abandoned, as the vehicle was unable to fulfil all-terrain warfare requirements and could not cross wide trenches."]}]}}
