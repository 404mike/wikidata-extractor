Instead, Powell signed Jimmy Gooch from Preston North End as his replacement. Gooch, aged 32, was more experienced than Smith and so took over as first-choice goalkeeper at the start of the 1953\u201354 season playing the first 20 games. Smith was called up to the first-team in November for a 1\u20131 draw with Hartlepools United. He remained in the side and played all but two games for the rest of the season, coming back into the team for the final league game of the season against Gateshead as City finished fifth. He kept 11 clean sheets, which included equalling a club best five in consecutive matches as City won a record nine straight games, during which they conceded just one goal."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Jimmy Gooch||||1953\u20131954||22||0||"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Gooch", "response": ["*Jimmy Gooch (footballer), English footballer", "*Jimmy Gooch (speedway rider) (1928\u20132011), speedway rider"]}]}}
