He also developed the Aquair towed turbine generator in which the same electrical generator was rotated by means of a towed turbine, again used by cruising sailors. These two generators allow long range cruisers to generate electricity for charging their battery banks from the free power of the winds and were manufactured by the 'Ampair' company in the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bell X-14", "response": ["The X-14 first flew on 19 February 1957 as a vertical takeoff, hover, then vertical landing. The first transition from hover to horizontal flight occurred on 24 May 1958. In 1959, its Viper engines were replaced with General Electric J85 engines. That year the aircraft was delivered to the NASA Ames Research Center as the X-14A. During the development of the P.1127, Hawker test pilots Bill Bedford and Hugh Merewether visited NASA Ames to fly the X-14 and acquaint themselves with jet V/STOL aircraft handling prior to the first flights of the prototype P.1127. It served as a test aircraft with NASA until 1981."]}, {"page": "Hawker Siddeley P.1127", "response": ["As the P.1127 had been developed at a time of deep UK defense cuts, Hawker had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S.Mason 1991, p. 413. Research assistance was also provided by the U.S., including a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable flight characteristics. Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14.Spick and Gunston 2000, pp. 359\u2013360. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.Spick and Gunston 2000, p. 358."]}, {"page": "Bill Bedford", "response": ["On his retirement in 1951, he joined Hawker Siddeley and was chief test pilot from 1956 till 1967. Together with his colleague Hugh Merewether he pioneered Hawker's development of V/STOL aircraft. Bedford was the first pilot to fly the Hawker P.1127, Kestrel, and Harrier. In addition to his land-based test pilot duties, he also pioneered the operation of V/STOL aircraft from a ship - the P.1127 on HMS Ark Royal in 1963."]}]}}
