He was a prominent figure in the local Orange Order.Graham was co-opted onto Newry and Mourne District Council in 1975, becoming that body's first DUP member and in 1982 he was elected council chairman by the controlling Social Democratic and Labour Party. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly at the 1982 election to represent South Down and remained a member until the Assembly shut down in 1986, serving as a member of the Agriculture, Finance and Personnel and Health and Social Services committees.Graham came to attention in the summer of 1985 when, in response to a call from local DUP councillor Ethel Smyth, he accompanied Rev. Ivan Foster and a group from the Third Force to join a banned loyalist parade attempting to march through the village of Castlewellan. The loyalists clashed with the Royal Ulster Constabulary although the ban was upheld and both Graham and Foster were arrested for their involvement.Graham ran afoul of the DUP leadership in 1987 when he continued to attend council meetings despite the party having adopted a policy of abstentionism in response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Representing his hometown of Kilkeel, he reasoned that he was of more value opposing the Agreement from within the council rather than following the party policy, which he felt was not an effective protest. He finally left the DUP in January 1989 and was re-elected in May under the label \"Protestant\". He resigned his council seat in 1991.Graham would later join the Progressive Unionist Party and unsuccessfully ran in South Down as their lead candidate in the 1996 Forum election. He subsequently ran in the 1998 Assembly election in South Down as an independent Unionist but he was eliminated on the first count.He died on 21 February 2012 after succumbing to an illness in hospital. He had been in failing health for a number of years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Graham", "response": ["George Graham may refer to:", "*Lord George Graham (1715\u20131747), naval officer, MP for Stirlingshire", "*George Graham (Northern Ireland politician) (1945\u20132012), Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party politician", "*George Graham (Scottish MP) (1730\u20131801), MP for Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire, Lord Lieutenant of Kinross-shire", "*George Graham (soldier) (1772\u20131830), Virginia lawyer and legislator, interim U.S. Secretary of War and commissioner of the General Land Office, father of George Mason Graham", "*George Graham (New Zealand politician) (1812\u20131901), New Zealand politician", "*George Graham (Victorian politician) (1838\u20131922), member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "*George Graham (New South Wales politician) (fl. 1861), member of the New South Wales Legislative Council", "*George Graham (North Carolina politician) (born 1949), member of the North Carolina General Assembly", "*George Graham (footballer, born 1944), Scottish football player who won titles as an Arsenal player and manager", "*George Graham (Australian footballer) (1903\u20131983), Australian rules footballer", "*George Graham (mountaineer), first ascent of Aoraki / Mount Cook", "*George Graham (rugby) (born 1966), rugby player for Scotland and Newcastle Falcons", "*George Graham (soccer) (1902\u20131966), player capped once for Canada", "*George Graham (bishop) (died 1643), Scottish bishop", "*George Graham (clockmaker) (1673\u20131751), English clockmaker, geophysicist, and inventor", "*George Graham (ethnographer) (1874\u20131952), New Zealand accountant, lawyer and ethnographer", "*George Graham (physician) (1882\u20131971), English physician and physiologist", "*George Graham (Registrar General), Registrar General of England and Wales (1842\u20131880)", "*George Graham (monologist) (1866\u20131903), American monologist, patent medicine salesman, and recording artist"]}, {"page": "George Seawright", "response": ["Following these high-profile political mistakes, the DUP withdrew the party whip from Seawright, although he managed to hold onto his support base and was returned to the Council in 1985 as an independent under the Protestant Unionist label.
