He is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary University of London, a television and radio presenter and a curator.\nBrotton writes about literature, history, material culture, trade, and east-west relations, particularly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He employs interdisciplinary approaches, looking at art, politics, history, travel writing and literature. His book A History of the World in Twelve Maps (Allen Lane, 2012) has been translated into twelve languages. It was accompanied by a three-part series on BBC Four, Maps: Power, Plunder and Possession. His The Sale of the Late King's Goods: Charles I and His Art Collection (Macmillan, 2006) was nominated for the Samuel Johnson Prize (now the Baillie Gifford Prize). It wryly proposes that the dispersal of Charles I's art collection in 1649 was a democratic move, one that merits imitation in the contemporary world. His 2016 book This Orient Isle: Elizabethan England and the Islamic World (London: Allen Lane, 2016) was serialised on BBC Radio 4 and won the Historical Writers Association Non-Fiction Crown (2017).Brotton collaborated as a curator and commentator with the artist and director of Factum Arte, Adam Lowe, in the exhibit Penelope\u2019s Labour: Weaving Words and Images, at the Venice Biennale in 2011, and in 2019 he and map librarian Nick Millea co-curated the exhibition Talking Maps at the Bodleian Library in Oxford.Brotton has written and presented various radio programmes for BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service on historical subjects including Shakespeare, the history of the ghetto, and El Dorado. He appears regularly on TV programmes and reviews for a variety of newspapers, magazines and journals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hessell-Tiltman Prize", "response": ["*Jerry Brotton, The Sale of the Late King's Goods: Charles I and His Art Collection ", "*Jerry Brotton, A History of the World in Twelve Maps ", "*Jerry Brotton, This Orient Isle: Elizabethan England and the Islamic World"]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["* Jerry Brotton, The Sale of the Late King's Goods: Charles I and his Art Collection"]}, {"page": "Earth's orbit", "response": ["Heliocentrism is the scientific model that first placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System and put the planets, including Earth, in its orbit. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. Aristarchus of Samos already proposed a heliocentric model in the third century BC. In the sixteenth century, Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus presented a full discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe  in much the same way as Ptolemy had presented his geocentric model in the second century. This \"Copernican revolution\" resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent. According to historian Jerry Brotton, \"Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book ... had been [printed more than] a century earlier, [the Dutch mapmaker] Joan Blaeu was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world.\"Jerry Brotton, A History of the World in Twelve Maps, London: Allen Lane, 2012,  p. 262."]}, {"page": "Frances Yates", "response": ["Although some of her conclusions would later be challenged by other scholars,For an example, see Lisa Jardine and Jerry Brotton, Global Interests: Renaissance Art Between East And West, Reaktion Books, 2005, , p. 240: \"Our analysis of the Valois Tapestries leads us to turn Yates's argument on its head: the tapestries actually are deeply antithetical to the Protestant, and specifically Huguenot, cause.\" Yates remains one of the major scholars of hermeticism in Renaissance Europe;E.g. described as such on http://nccsc.net/2007/2/15/reviving-iconography, http://www.marlowe-society.org/marlowe/life/freethinkers1.html . and her book The Art of Memory (1966) has been named one of the most significant non-fiction books of the 20th century. Paolo Rossi identified two key points in it: the past importance and later loss of mnemotechnics as a human power, where he argues that she overstated the occult or \"Jungian\" aspect; and the subsequent marginalization of the area, which he considers valid and of wider applicability.Paolo Rossi, Logic and the Art of Memory (2000 translation), pp. xxii\u2013xxiii.

Historian R. J. Knecht questions this reading and calls the tapestries \"an enigma\". The reason Henry III and Catherine did not throw the full weight of France behind Anjou's campaign in the Netherlands was that they feared provoking a war with Spain. Knecht asserts that a gift of tapestries, however magnificent, would hardly have changed their minds.Knecht, Catherine de' Medici, p. 244. More recently, historians Lisa Jardine and Jerry Brotton assess the imagery of the tapestries and \"turn Yates's argument on its head\", concluding that \"the tapestries actually are deeply antithetical to the Protestant, and specifically Huguenot, cause.\"Jardine and Brotton, p. 240. They argue that the Huguenots are depicted in the tapestries not, as Yates believed, to demonstrate the tolerance of the Valois and offer a vision of different faiths and peoples at peace, but to illustrate the certain defeat of the Protestants at the hands of the Valois.Jardine and Brotton, p. 125. They interpret the inclusion of Turks alongside the Huguenots to indicate that both were regarded as \"infidels\", an association previously made in the Tunis tapestries for the Habsburg Philip II's marriage to Mary I of England.Jardine and Brotton, p. 130.", "*Jardine, Lisa, and Jerry Brotton.

He became an art dealer and a major collector of paintings and drawings.  After the execution of Charles I of England in 1649, his art collection was broken up and sold off in order to repay the debtors of the former king.  Van Leemput was active as a buyer of artworks sold off from the royal collection.  He acquired 35 paintings and sculptures from the sale of the collection over a period of six months.Ivan Lindsay, The History of Loot and Stolen Art: from Antiquity until the Present Day,  Andrews UK Limited, 2 Jun, 2014  He purchased works from Titian, Giorgione, Correggio and Andrea del Sarto.  He was able to acquire the famous equestrian portrait by van Dyck of Charles I with M. de St Antoine.Jerry Brotton, The sale of the late king's goods: Charles I and his art collection, Macmillan, 2006, p. 316  He tried to sell the painting in Antwerp but was unsuccessful because his asking price of 1,500 guineas was too high.  It is possible that he was in fact trying to sell a copy of the portrait he had made himself.  After the Restoration in 1660, the painting was still with him.  It was recovered from him for Charles II through legal proceedings.Lionel Cust,, Notes on Pictures in the royal collections: collected and edited for the Burlington Magazine, in: The Burlington Magazine, 1910, p. 160"]}, {"page": "Brotton, Jerry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jerry Brotton"]}]}}
