He published the first images of two tubes of water in 1973 in the journal Nature, followed by the picture of a living animal, a clam, and in 1974 by the image of the thoracic cavity of a mouse. Lauterbur called his imaging method zeugmatography, a term which was replaced by (N)MR imaging. In the late 1970s, physicists Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur developed MRI-related techniques, like the echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique."]}, {"page": "October 9", "response": ["*1933 \u2013 Peter Mansfield, English physicist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "List of physicists", "response": ["*Peter Mansfield \u2013 U.K. (1933\u20132017)"]}, {"page": "1933", "response": ["* October 9 \u2013 Peter Mansfield, British physicist and Nobel laureate (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "2003", "response": ["* Physiology or Medicine \u2013 Paul Lauterbur, Peter Mansfield"]}, {"page": "Nature (journal)", "response": ["When Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research initially rejected by Nature and published only after Lauterbur appealed against the rejection, Nature acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled, \"Coping with Peer Rejection\":"]}, {"page": "2017", "response": ["** Peter Mansfield, British Nobel physicist (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "East Midlands", "response": ["Boots UK is based in Lenton in Nottingham, with 2,500 UK stores, where Stewart Adams developed Ibuprofen in the 1960s on Rutland Road in West Bridgford, and Vision Express are nearby, next to the A52.

Crookes Healthcare, formerly Boots and now Reckitt Benckiser, make Strepsils and Optrex on the enormous Boots site, and Boots Contract Manufacturing (BCM) make products for other firms; it makes Benylin for McNeil. On the ng2 business park, Specsavers have their corporate eyecare and contact lens division. Three out of the four main UK opticians are sited in Nottingham. The MRI scanner was developed at the University of Nottingham by Sir Peter Mansfield; MRI scanners were developed mainly by GEC Medical, once invented; MRI harnesses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of the hydrogen nucleus; Raymond Vahan Damadian of USA also claims the MRI invention."]}]}}
