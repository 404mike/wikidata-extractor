With that in mind, Womack made several impressive signings during the close season, among them Arsenal centre half Jack Butler and Leicester City keeper Joe Wright.Edwards, Leigh; Gibbes, Jon; Lovis, John (1999).

Finally it appeared that the Magpies had hit upon a winning formula and by early October they were second in the Third Division South table, just four points behind leaders Notts County.  Much of the upturn in Torquay's fortunes was due to the scoring prowess of new centre forward Jimmy Trotter who had already scored thirteen goals before the end of October and would go on to score a total of 28 goals in all competitions by the end of the season.  Trotter was ably assisted by two more new forwards in Billy Clayson and Albert Hutchinson, who contributed another 25 goals between them.  Hutchinson was to eventually prove a very loyal servant to Torquay, remaining with the club up until the outbreak of World War II.Edwards, Leigh (1997). The Definitive Torquay United F.C.. The Association of Football Statisticians. .", "|align=\"left\"| Albert Hutchinson", "The side chosen by Frank Womack reflected the changes he had brought to the team for this season with only Bob Smith, Harry Waller and Harry Keeling having played for the Magpies during the previous campaign.  This was a notable match for Bob Smith as he was making his 100th appearance for the club, the first player to reach that landmark for Torquay United and he was, in fact, an ever-present for the Magpies this season appearing in all 46 games.  Protecting Joe Wright's goal was his namesake Jim Wright and Dick Hill while former Arsenal centre half Jack Butler was flanked in the midfield by Smith and Billy Clayson.  Clayson was unusually playing in the right half position having been replaced in his more accustomed role of inside forward by Harry Keeling in the previous match, an away trip to Gillingham.  Having scored two goals in that game, Keeling retained his position in the forward line forcing Clayson to make the switch into midfield, pushing Jim Wright into the right back position at the expense of Jack Fowler.  Taking the outside forward positions were Harry Waller and William Bell with Albert Hutchinson and potent centre forward Jimmy Trotter completing the forward line.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was Trotter who forced an unlikely replay by scoring his 18th goal of the season so far.", "|align=\"left\"|Albert Hutchinson", "|3 || FW ||  || Albert Hutchinson || 11 || 0 || 11", "|Albert Hutchinson"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Albert Hutchinson", "|3 || FW ||  || Albert Hutchinson || 10 || 0 || 10"]}, {"page": "1932\u201333 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Albert Hutchinson", "|2 || FW ||  || Albert Hutchinson || 15 || 2 || 17"]}, {"page": "List of Torquay United F.C. players", "response": ["After joining the Football League in 1927, the first player to make 100 appearances for Torquay United was Bob Smith.
