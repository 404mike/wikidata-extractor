The role was originally going to be given by that of a skinny and white actor. His earned Rerun sobriquet was chosen because the character had to continuously repeat all of his classes during summer school. He became one of the show's top characters with a trademark red beret, suspenders, and the dance moves he previously used during his time with The Lockers. In 1985, Berry returned to reprise his role as Rerun in the series What's Happening Now!!. He was fired before the first season ended due to a salary dispute, when he requested that he receive more money than the rest of the cast. Berry's widow, Essie Berry, told Urbanite magazine at Georgia State University that their unwillingness to pay Fred Berry his due in both shows led to their early cancellations (although What's Happening Now!! did last another two seasons, and both series lasted three seasons each).", "Berry was married six times to four different women, the first two of whom he married twice each. He has three children: DeShannon, Portia and Freddy, who works as Fred Berry Jr.", "* Lockerlegends.net Fred Berry"]}]}}
