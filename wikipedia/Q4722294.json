Bryan published in Nature on 27 April 1905 sparked controversy among Cambridge professors at the time. The review received several notable responses from Whittaker's colleagues, although Whittaker himself never publicly spoke of it. Section 4.3 The \"Fictitious Problem\" polemic The main actors in the polemic, other than Whittaker and Bryan, are an anonymous professor referred to only as \"An Old Average College Don\", Alfred Barnard Basset, Edward Routh, and Charles Baron Clarke. The controversy revolved around Bryan's claim that many of the problems included in the book are \"fictitious\", similar to those used in the Cambridge Tripos examinations. Of particular contention was Bryan's statement that a \"perfectly rough body placed on a perfectly smooth surface forms as interesting a subject for speculation as the well-known irresistible body meeting the impenetrable obstacle\" and that \"[w]hat the average college don forgets is that roughness or smoothness are matters which concern two surfaces, not one body\". The controversy stretched from 18 May to 22 June with letters on the dispute published in five issues of Nature. A reviewer later wrote that \"100 years after they were written, it is difficult not to view the whole polemic as prompted by a bout of hair-splitting on the part of Bryan\", though it was acknowledged that Bryan's original claim was \"undoubtedly correct\" and the \"polemic\" was likely a misunderstanding.", "The 18 May issue of Nature contained two letters starting the controversy, the first was an anonymous response under the title \"Fictitious Problems in Mathematics\" from an author referring to him or herself only as An Old Average College Don, while the second was a response from Brayan under the same title. The old college don charged Bryan to point to a page number where such problems are used, while Bryan responded by saying that the problems are ubiquitous and finding the places where the correct definition is used is easier than pointing out all the places where it is wrong. In the 25 May issue of Nature, Alfred Barnard Basset and Edward Routh joined the debate. Routh explained that when \"bodies are said to be perfectly rough, it is usually meant that they are so rough that the amount of friction necessary to prevent sliding in the given circumstances can certainly be called into play\" and states that the statements are abbreviations meant to \"make the question concise\". In a similar tone, Basset wrote that the wording is used to designate \"an ideal state of matter\". The 1 June issue of Nature contained a response from Charles Baron Clarke and another rebuttal Bryan. Charles Baron Clarke insinuates that he is the \"Old Average College Don\" that wrote the first anonymous letter, and again emphasises his original complaint. The final two letters of the controversy were published by Routh and Bryan on the eighth and twenty-second of June, respectively."]}]}}
