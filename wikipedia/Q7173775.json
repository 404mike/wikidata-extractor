From the start, the Bury forwards directed high crosses into the goalmouth to test the Southampton goalkeeper, Jack Robinson. Although Southampton kept things even at first, their first mistake was by Peter Durber who allowed Richards to force a corner. This was taken by Plant whose cross was converted by McLuckie into the first goal, scored after nine minutes of play. The Observer says that, although Southampton tried hard to make amends, they failed against \"a clever and determined defence\".", "|LB || Peter Durber"]}, {"page": "Tom Nicol", "response": ["Nicol was \"completely fearless, even reckless (and) usually won the ball irrespective of obstacles\" and became \"one of the finest backs ever to don the cherry and white shirt\".

In the 1899\u201300 season, Haynes lost his place to Peter Durber and made only four appearances, before retiring at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Jack Eccles", "response": ["Eccles' partnership with the equally rugged but more skilful Tom Robertson was a major factor in Stoke's progression to the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1898\u201399.

He captained the side in 1899\u20131900 before losing his place in the side to Peter Durber. He spent the 1901\u201302 season with Burslem Port Vale's reserve side, but returned to Stoke in the summer of 1902, becoming club trainer.
