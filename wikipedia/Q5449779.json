Play resumed and Redmond became involved in a further Dublin attack receiving the ball from Mick Deegan, Deegan having had it passed to him by Keith Barr. Redmond sent the ball a considerable distance, towards Dessie Farrell. Farrell then tripped Tyrone back Chris Lawn and the referee blew his whistle. Paul Clarke charged in and kicked Lawn while he was on the ground; Clarke had his name taken by the referee, this nearly two minutes after Redmond had been sent off. While this was occurring, Tony O'Donoghue provided an update from the sideline for RT\u00c9 television viewers on the extent of Fergal Logan's \"very bad\" ankle injury. Finbar McConnell moved to take the free for Tyrone but was stopped short by a further blow from the referee's whistle. As the referee gently ambled towards standby referee Willie O'Mahony, the television commentator mentioned \"a potential nightmare few minutes there for\u2026 uh\u2026 Dublin, and for Charlie Redmond in particular\". O'Mahony exchanged words with the referee at the side of the field. The referee then headed in the direction of Redmond, shaking his head sternly, and began ushering Redmond from the field. The TV commentator said: \"This is very confusing. I've never seen anything like this in an All-Ireland final. [Pause] I think he has sent him off! [Further pause] So Dublin are indeed down to fourteen players\". The incident lasted more than three minutes, before Redmond left the field, shaking his head.RT\u00c9 video footage (available on YouTube). Note that Se\u00e1n Moran, writing in The Irish Times in 2019, claimed erroneously that: \"Watched on YouTube, the forbidden period on the field comes in at 28 seconds \u2014 admittedly that's nearly half a minute more than ideal, but not nearly the length of time some had thought, and during which Redmond never touched the ball\". The \"forbidden time\" when viewed on YouTube is more than three minutes and Redmond did in fact touch the ball."]}]}}
