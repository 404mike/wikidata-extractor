Jackson led Pompey to two top league titles in the 1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350 seasons, the only in their history. He departed in the summer of 1952 to take over at ambitious second division club Hull City, but could not replicate the success he had at Fratton Park.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hull City A.F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Bob Jackson||||June 1952 \u2013 March 1955 ||123||42||26||55||34.14"]}, {"page": "Portsmouth F.C.", "response": ["The Football League finally resumed in 1946\u201347. Portsmouth had capitalised on the footballers called up to serve in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in the war years and recruited some of them. In this way, Portsmouth had the pick of some of the best. Portsmouth ended the 1946\u201347 Football League First Division season in 12th place. On 1 May 1947, legendary manager Jack Tinn left Portsmouth, with Bob Jackson taking over the role on the same day.", "The second post-war Football League First Division season resumed under manager Bob Jackson in 1947\u201348. This was also the first season Portsmouth wore red socks, which replaced their traditional black socks. The red socks were an idea proposed by Portsmouth's honorary president, Field Marshal Montgomery, who had suggested that Portsmouth should wear red socks to commemorate the sacrifice of British servicemen lost in war. Red is traditionally the colour of the British Army and also of the Remembrance poppy flower, and so Montgomery's idea was adopted by Portsmouth at the start of the season. Bob Jackson's Portsmouth finished in 8th place at the end of the 1947\u201348 First Division season.", "In their 50-year \"Golden Jubilee\" anniversary 1948\u201349 season, Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win a historic Football League and FA Cup \"double\".  The potential of a rare 'Double' saw Fratton Park attracting average home attendances of 36,000 supporters, and a record attendance of 51,385 in an FA Cup quarter-final match against Derby County on 26 February 1949, which Portsmouth won 2\u20131. Portsmouth lost 1\u20133 in the FA Cup semi-final against Leicester City on 26 March 1949 at the neutral Highbury stadium. Portsmouth however, did win one half of the 'Double', securing the First Division title and becoming Football League Champions of England at the end of the 1948\u201349 season, with Manchester United finishing as runners-up. Portsmouth's championship-winning team consisted of Ernest Butler, Phil Rookes, Harry Ferrier, Jimmy Scoular, Reg Flewin, Jimmy Dickinson, Peter Harris, Duggie Reid, Ike Clarke, Len Phillips, Jack Froggatt, Jasper Yeuell, Lindy Delapenha, Bert Barlow and Cliff Parker.", "Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side beat Aston Villa 5\u20131 on the last day of the following 1949\u201350 season, winning the Football League title again for a second consecutive season \u2013 on goal average \u2013 as both Portsmouth and runners up Wolverhampton Wanderers finished the season with 53 points each, and only one point ahead of third place Sunderland on 52 points. Portsmouth are one of only five English teams to have won back-to-back consecutive top-flight League titles since the end of World War II.", "Eddie Lever took over at Pompey in 1952 after championship-winning manager Bob Jackson joined Hull City. In the 1952\u201353 season, Portsmouth finished in 15th place and only 4 points above the relegation zone, with Arsenal F.C. winning the league title."]}]}}
