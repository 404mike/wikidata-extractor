Manager Jackie Gibbons left the club at the start of the 1952\u201353 season and was succeeded by his assistant Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953\u201354 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing Dear Old Pals."]}, {"page": "Israel national football team", "response": ["|  Jackie Gibbons || 1956"]}, {"page": "Hapoel Petah Tikva F.C.", "response": ["* Jackie Gibbons (1956\u201357)", "* Jackie Gibbons (1958\u201360)"]}]}}
