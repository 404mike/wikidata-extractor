Eng., IEE Premium Award, FIEEE, MIEE, USA Medal of Freedom with Bronze Palm (25 February 1909 \u2013 9 September 2002) was an English electronics engineer and consultant, who is credited as being the first person to popularise the concepts that ultimately led to the development of the integrated circuit, commonly called the microchip, in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Dummer passed the first radar trainers and became a pioneer of reliability engineering at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern in the 1940s.\nManchester College of Arts and Technology\nBorn in Hull, Dummer studied electrical engineering at Manchester College of Technology starting in the early 1930s. By the early 1940s he was working at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern (later to become the Royal Radar Establishment).\nHis work with colleagues at TRE led him to the belief that it would be possible to fabricate multiple circuit elements on and into a substance like silicon. In 1952 he became one of the first people to speak publicly on the topic of integrated circuits, presenting his conceptual work at a conference in Washington, DC. As a result, he has been called \"the prophet of the integrated circuit\".Dummer was admitted to a nursing home in Malvern in 2000 due to a stroke and died in September 2002, aged 93.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Integrated circuit", "response": ["Another early proponent of the concept was Geoffrey Dummer (1909\u20132002), a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the British Ministry of Defence.
