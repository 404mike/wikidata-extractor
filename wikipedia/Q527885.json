Further financial backing saw Porterfield and the Blades make a push for promotion in season 1985\u201386, when manager Porterfield went for experience to get the Blades up, signing veterans Ken McNaught, Peter Withe, Phil Thompson and Ray Lewington. This led the Blades to gain the nickname \"Dad's Army\" because of the combined ages of the 4 players signed (they were all in their 30s). Fans were unhappy that crowd favourite Edwards was dropped to the bench in favour of his \"aged\" colleagues. United's start was actually very bright that season however, and after a 3\u20130 win away to early season promotion favourites Portsmouth, were fancied for another climb to the top tier. However, injury and bad results saw the club's fortunes falter, and the crowd's anger turn on Porterfield, who after a 5\u20132 defeat to Norwich, was sacked after a car-park demonstration."]}, {"page": "1982 European Cup Final", "response": ["|CB ||5 || Ken McNaught"]}, {"page": "Ken mcnaught", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ken McNaught "]}, {"page": "History of Aston Villa F.C.
