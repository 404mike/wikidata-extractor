She was active in New York City theater throughout the early 2000s, during which she appeared in such shows as Avery Crozier's Eat the Runt, Hunt Holman's Spanish Girl, A. R. Gurney's Sylvia and Simon Mendes da Costa's Losing Louis. She also appeared in an Off Broadway musical adaptation of the pornographic film Debbie Does Dallas, and she is featured in the show's original cast recording soundtrack.", "Starting in October 2006, Williamson played Bella Holland, the office assistant and mistress of a married man, in a production of the English Simon Mendes da Costa play Losing Louis, which played at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The show opened with a controversial scene in which the protagonist performs oral sex on Williamson's character while his six-year-old son hides under the bed. The show received largely negative reviews, Williamson herself received mixed critiques. The New York Times writer Charles Isherwood said Williamson was one of the stronger cast members, but added, \"the actors cannot do much to freshen the coarse innuendoes or breathe life into the plot contrivances\". Elysa Gardner, of USA Today, said Williamson added \"dynamic support\" to the show. North Jersey Media Group critic Robert Feldberg, who was critical of the show, said her performance was amateurish and reminded him of \"middling community theater.\" However, Feldberg said other more experienced actors were similarly bad in the show, so Williamson's faults can be blamed in part on the director. Backstage said Williamson and other cast members \"fail to register in any credible way\"."]}, {"page": "Michael Codron", "response": ["Codron's next project, in association with the Manhattan Theatre Club, was the play Losing Louis, which he produced in the West End at the Hampstead Theatre (and later Trafalgar Studios) in January 2006, before opening on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre in September 2006.
