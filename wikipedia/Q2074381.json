His first recording was with the Spitfire Boys in 1977 and then the Slits in 1979. He was the drummer of Siouxsie and the Banshees from 1979 to 1996, and the Creatures from 1981 to 2004. Budgie worked with other musicians including John Cale, Leonard Eto (formerly of the Kodo Drummers) and John Grant.\nIn 2013, Spin rated him at No. 28 in their list of \"The 100 Greatest Drummers of Alternative Music\", writing: \"Post-punk introduced a lot of amazing drummers, but none more influential than Budgie. With the Banshees, Budgie didn't just play rhythms\u2014he played hooks and leads, brilliant parts that set the songs on fire. His tom-tom-intensive approach, [was] enlightened by his awareness of world music\". Spin considered his \"most booming moment\" to be \"Into the Light\", from 1981's Juju, saying: \"Budgie drums up a marvel of kinetic syncopation and invention\".Stewart Copeland of The Police described Budgie's playing as \"very economical and offbeat\", adding, \"Budgie didn\u2019t play your standard hi-hat\u2013kick\u2013snare; there were a lot of tom-toms and a big throb.\" Ari Up of the Slits felt that he was \"a very sensitive drummer\", saying, \"He could go from reggae to punk to funk to jazz [...] but still very steady.\" Larry Mullen Jr. of U2 qualified Budgie as \"one of the greats\" for his work with the Banshees. NME readers voted Budgie the best drummer of 1983; music journalist David Cavanagh commented that \"Terry Chambers was, along with Budgie of Siouxsie and the Banshees, the outstanding English drummer of the post-punk era\"; Ian McCulloch said that Echo & the Bunnymen's drummer \"Pete de Freitas loved his drumming\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Siouxsie and the Banshees", "response": ["During their career, Siouxsie and the Banshees released 11 studio albums and 30 singles. The band experienced several line-up changes, with Siouxsie and Severin being the only constant members. They disbanded in 1996, with Siouxsie and drummer Budgie continuing to record music as the Creatures, a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career.", "The Banshees' second album, Join Hands, was released in 1979. In Melody Maker, Jon Savage described \"Poppy Day\" as \"a short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards\", and Record Mirror described the whole record as a dangerous work that \"should be heard\". The Banshees embarked on a major tour to promote the album. A few dates into the tour in September, Morris and McKay left an in-store signing after an argument and quit the band. In need of replacements to fulfill tour dates, the Banshees' manager called drummer Budgie, formerly with the Slits, and asked him to audition. Budgie was hired, but Siouxsie and Severin had no success auditioning guitarists. Robert Smith of the Cure offered his services in case they could not find a guitarist (his group were already the support band on the tour), so the band held him to it after seeing too many \"rock virtuosos\". The tour resumed in September and after the last concert, Smith returned to the Cure.", "Drummer Budgie became a permanent member, and the band entered the studios to record the single \"Happy House\" with guitarist John McGeoch, then still a member of Magazine. Their third album, Kaleidoscope, released in 1980, saw the Banshees exploring new musical territories with the use of other instruments like synthesizers, sitars and drum machines. The group initially had a concept of making each song sound completely different, without regard to whether or not the material could be performed in concert. Melody Maker described the result as \"a kaleidoscope of sound and imagery, new forms, and content, flashing before our eyes\". Kaleidoscope was a commercial success, peaking at number 5 in the UK albums chart. This lineup, featuring McGeoch on guitar, toured the United States for the first time in support of the album, playing their first shows in New York City in November 1980.", "During the 1981 accompanying tour, Siouxsie and Budgie secretly became a couple. At the same time, they also began a drum-and-voice duo called the Creatures, releasing their first EP, Wild Things.", "During 1983, the band members worked on several side projects; Siouxsie and Budgie composed the first Creatures album, Feast, while Severin and Smith recorded as the Glove. Smith then insisted on documenting his time with the Banshees, so the group released a cover version of the Beatles' \"Dear Prudence\" in September 1983. It became their UK biggest hit, reaching number 3 on the Singles Chart. They also released a live album, Nocturne, and completed their sixth studio album, Hy\u00e6na. Shortly before its release in May 1984, Smith left the group, citing health issues due to an overloaded schedule, being in two bands at once.", "Following a lengthy break, the band recruited multi-instrumentalist Martin McCarrick and guitarist Jon Klein. The quintet recorded Peepshow in 1988, with non-traditional rock instrumentation including cello and accordion. Q magazine praised the album in its 5-star review: \"Peepshow takes place in some distorted fairground of the mind where weird and wonderful shapes loom\". The first single, \"Peek-a-Boo\", was seen by critics as a \"brave move\" with horns and dance elements. Sounds wrote: \"The snare gets slapped, Siouxsie's voice meanders all around your head and it all comes magically together\". \"Peek-a-Boo\" was their first real breakthrough in the United States. After the tour, the band decided to take a break, with Siouxsie and Budgie recording as the Creatures and releasing their most critically acclaimed album to date, Boomerang, and Severin and McCarrick working on material together.", "In 1993, the Banshees recorded new songs based on string arrangements, and then played them in festivals abroad. On their return home, they hired former Velvet Underground member John Cale to produce the rest of the record. At its release, 1995's The Rapture was described by Melody Maker as \"a fascinating, transcontinental journey through danger and exotica\". A few weeks after its release, Polydor dropped the band from its roster and Klein was replaced on the band's last tour in 1995 by ex-Psychedelic Furs guitarist Knox Chandler. In April 1996, the Banshees disbanded after 20 years of working together. Siouxsie and Budgie announced that they would carry on recording as the Creatures. In 1999, they released the album Anima Animus to critical acclaim.", "In 2002, Universal Music kicked off the band's remastered back catalogue by releasing The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees. In April, Siouxsie, Severin, Budgie and Chandler reunited briefly for the Seven Year Itch tour, which spawned the Seven Year Itch live album and DVD in 2003. The day after their last concert in Tokyo, Japan, Siouxsie and Budgie stayed in town on their own and entered into a recording studio as the Creatures.
