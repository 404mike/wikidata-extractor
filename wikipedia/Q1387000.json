The only contemporary specimen labeled B.serratifolia in the Linnaean herbarium is a branchlet with juvenile leaves which cannot be definitely identified as B.aemula or B.serrata. Salisbury commented in his description of the species that B.serratifolia was very distinct from B.serrata, leading some observers to identify it with B.aemula. Brown, in his description of the latter, included B.serratifolia as a synonym with a question mark, being himself unsure of its identity. However, Salisbury's taxon appeared as Banksia serraefolia in Knight's 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae (which was in fact substantially written by Salisbury), and was there reduced to a synonym of B.serrata. Due to this confusion, Salisbury's name was largely ignored. It was adopted by Otto Kuntze in 1891 in his Revisio Generum Plantarum, when he rejected the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1776 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, referring to this species as Sirmuellera serratifolia. This application of the principle of priority was largely ignored by Kuntze's contemporaries, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved and Sirmuellera rejected in 1940.
