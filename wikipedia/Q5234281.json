The Boston Digital Arm is a recent artificial limb that has taken advantage of these more advanced processors. The arm allows movement in five axes and allows the arm to be programmed for a more customized feel. Recently the I-LIMB Hand, invented in Edinburgh, Scotland, by David Gow has become the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits. The hand also possesses a manually rotatable thumb which is operated passively by the user and allows the hand to grip in precision, power, and key grip modes."]}, {"page": "1994 in film", "response": ["| Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle || Fine Line Features || Alan Rudolph (director/screenplay); Randy Sue Coburn (screenplay); Jennifer Jason Leigh, Campbell Scott, Matthew Broderick, Peter Gallagher, Jennifer Beals, Andrew McCarthy, Wallace Shawn, Martha Plimpton, Sam Robards, Lili Taylor, James LeGros, Gwyneth Paltrow, Nick Cassavetes, David Thornton, Heather Graham, Tom McGowan, Chip Zien, Gary Basaraba, Jane Adams, Stephen Baldwin, Matt Malloy, Rebecca Miller, Jake Johannsen, Amelia Campbell, David Gow, Leni Parker, Stanley Tucci, Keith Carradine, Jon Favreau, Peter Benchley, Malcolm Gets, Gisele Rousseau || Biography, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Paul Tibbets", "response": ["In other fictional portrayals, Nicholas Kilbertus was Tibbets in the film Day One (1989), David Gow played him in the TV movie Hiroshima (1995), and Ian Shaw played the part in the BBC's TV docudrama Hiroshima (2005), for which Tibbets was also interviewed on camera.

This also declined, following an extensive vaccination campaign in the early 1960s. During the 1960s, it became a centre of treatment for cases of phocomelia brought on by thalidomide. With the reduction in cases of childhood disability, the hospital (now renamed the Princess Margaret Rose Orthopaedic Hospital) began to focus on post-accident orthopaedic surgery and rehabilitation, mainly dealing with the victims of traffic accidents, and including a centre for the provision of prosthetic limbs. The hospital became a centre for research and development into prostheses, including the development of the first electrically-powered prosthetic arms by David Gow's research group in 1998."]}, {"page": "Gow, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Gow"]}]}}
