It uses the original characterizations and storylines, but takes place in an English village rather than Vermont (only the scenery and accents show this\u2014the town is still called Beldingsville). Like the book, it ends with Aunt Polly and Dr. Chilton married and Pollyanna walking, but the scene is the actual wedding with Pollyanna back for a visit rather than a letter as in the book."]}, {"page": "William and Mary (TV series)", "response": ["* Georgina Terry - Julia Shawcross (18 episodes, 2003\u20132005)"]}, {"page": "Terry (surname)", "response": ["*Georgina Terry, British actress"]}]}}
