He was dismissed in October 1977, with York 22nd in the Fourth Division, and was succeeded by former Charlton Athletic player Charlie Wright in November. He could not prevent a re-election bid after 1977\u201378, before leading York to 10th place the following season. Wright was dismissed in March 1980 with the team near the bottom of the table, and under caretaker manager Barry Lyons York finished 17th in 1979\u201380. He was appointed permanently in May 1980, and York finished bottom of the table in his first full season in charge.
