At 17, she was the youngest ever winner of the Welsh Senior Closed. She reached a career-high world ranking of World No. 16 in January 2000. She often competed in the top men's leagues in Wales and as the number one player in the Professional Bundelsleague in Germany. She was a well-respected player on the professional tour and was often admired for her athletic abilities on the court. \nDuring her career as an Elite Cymru Athlete she suffered a serious illness that many thought would end her professional career as an athlete. However, after nearly three years off the professional squash circuit she made an amazing recovery and clawed her world ranking back from last in the women\u2019s world squash rankings to world number 16. Tegwen\u2019s first tournament back on the professional circuit was the Washington Open (that was played in Seattle). Due to a long period off the squash circuit, she had to come through qualifying rounds to reach the main draw. She amazed those who thought it not possible to play at such a world level after being so unwell by winning the tournament final in straight sets to Latasha Khan (who reached a career high of world ranked 18). Tegwen subsequently went on to compete in the well respected Monte Carlo Classic, beating several top world ranked players to reach the semi finals. Tegwen has won several professional tournaments such as the Savcour Finnish Open, the Washington Open, Toulouse Open, Welsh Open and Iceland Open. During her glittering squash career she also represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne (singles and doubles), at world and European Team championships, home internationals and during different test series such as Wales verses South Africa. Tegwen often paired with Gavin Jones for mixed doubles events, winning a test series against the National Irish team in Belfast before going out to compete in the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth games where they narrowly lost in the quarter finals to the Australian mixed doubles pair (Natalie Grinham and Joseph Kneipp) who went on to win the gold.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "International standard", "response": ["There are not many books that cover standards in general but a book written in 2019 by Nicholas Rich and Tegwen Malik gives a very comprehensive overview of the history of standards, how ISO standards are drafted along with key ISO standards such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. A paper has been published explaining the differences between international standards and private standards."]}, {"page": "Annelize Naud\u00e9", "response": ["|  Tegwen Malik"]}, {"page": "1995 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Carla Venter || Tegwen Malik ||6\u20139 9\u20136 9\u20137 9\u20133"]}, {"page": "1997 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Kate Major || Tegwen Malik *\t||3\u20139 9\u20133 9\u20131 9\u20135", "| Rachael Grinham || Tegwen Malik ||\t9\u20137 9\u20132 9\u201310 3\u20139 9\u20133 "]}, {"page": "1998 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Liz Irving || Tegwen Malik ||9-5 1-9 9-7 8-9 9-5"]}, {"page": "1999 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Linda Charman || Tegwen Malik ||9-2 9-2 9-1"]}, {"page": "2003 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Tegwen Malik || Annelize Naud\u00e9 ||\t9-3 1-9 9-0 9-1"]}, {"page": "2004 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Shelley Kitchen || Tegwen Malik ||w/o"]}, {"page": "2005 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Tegwen Malik || Carrie Hastings || 9\u20130 9\u20132 9\u20130", "| Tania Bailey || Tegwen Malik ||9\u20133 9\u20134 9\u20131"]}, {"page": "2006 Women's British Open Squash Championship", "response": ["| Tegwen Malik || C\u00e9lia Allamargot || 9\u20130 9\u20131 9\u20133"]}]}}
