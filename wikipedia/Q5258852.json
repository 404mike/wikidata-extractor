He made 68 appearances for Rovers scoring 11 goals in two seasons. Brian Clough was wanting to sign him but was put off by the asking price of \u00a3140,000 so he controversially told Curran's brother of his interest so Curran would not sign a new contract, thus reducing the transfer fee. He signed for Nottingham Forest in August 1975 with Rovers receiving \u00a350,000 plus keeper Dennis Peacock and winger Ian Miller. In two seasons, he played 48 games scoring 12 goals for Forest, helping them gain promotion to Division One in the 1976\u201377 season. Curran lost favour after a disagreement with Forest assistant manager Peter Taylor, and made a written transfer request in August 1977, which was accepted. He was loaned out to Bury during October 1977 and eventually switched to Derby County in a \u00a350,000 move the following month."]}, {"page": "Willie Boyd", "response": ["He was signed by English Division 4 club Doncaster Rovers in February 1980, enabling the club to sell the current keeper, Dennis Peacock, for some much needed funds.
