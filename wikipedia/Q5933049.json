Whyte joined Hibernian in 1972 and made five league appearances, but refused to abandon his medical studies when the club asked him to become a full-time professional. He subsequently moved to Dunfermline Athletic in 1976. Dunfermline had been relegated from the First Division in 1975\u201376 and were unable to sustain full-time football. Whyte established himself as their first choice goalkeeper. Whyte kept the position for nine years, playing 362 games in total while keeping 116 shutouts. After retiring from his football career in 1987, Whyte became the Dunfermline club doctor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whyte (surname)", "response": ["* Hugh Whyte (1955\u20132009), Scottish footballer (Dunfermline Athletic FC)"]}, {"page": "History of Dunfermline Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Dunfermline, managed by Pat Stanton started the 1980s in poor form. The core of the team were Pars stalwarts, Dr Hugh Whyte in goal, John Salton, Kenny Thomson and Dr Bobby Robertson in defence and Sandy McNaughton up front.  Of this quintet only Salton was not an ever-present in the league campaign. The team developed a habit of losing streaks, 2 of five games and 2 of three games and this caused relegation nerves.  They hovered in third bottom position for most of the last third of the season, only being saved by the ineptitude of the Stirling Albion side who failed to score in their last thirteen games and by Berwick Rangers who had held up the division for most of the season.", "A fresh season beckoned with a poor start with only three wins by the end of October caused yet another change of manager with the resignation of Tom Forsyth. The reserve team coach with no managerial experience was chosen from a long line of candidates. Jim Leishman had a strong Dunfermline pedigree, as a boy he had watched the 1960s Pars legends in European games and had progressed through the youth ranks to first team football before his playing career was ended by a bad leg break.  The team initially continued to struggle under Leishman but he signed from Hong Kong Rangers John Watson for \u00a3300 in what proved to be a good move for the club. An otherwise uneventful 1983\u201384 season ended with a brief flourish and a final 9th position in Division 2. Hugh Whyte was the only ever-present and Stephen Morrison was the top league scorer with a meagre 9 goals.", "The 1984\u201385 season opened in dramatic fashion.  Six straight wins took the Pars to the top of the league with John Watson, Grant Jenkins and Norrie McCathie scoring well.  The defence had been strengthened with the arrival of Dave Young at centre half. Good form lasted until October when the team hit a sticky patch which lasted until February. They managed one solitary victory over local rivals Cowdenbeath in November during this period and surrendered top spot to Alloa. The end of the league competition was closely fought but Montrose snatched the championship, with Alloa runners-up and Dunfermline third.  Hugh Whyte, after long service since 1976, played his final league game of the season with a clean sheet against Stenhousemuir in March.  Ian Westwater took over the goalkeeping mantle. The team scored 61 goals over the course of the season, John Watson leading the way with 15 but Grant Jenkins with 9, Norrie McCathie and Stevie Morrison with 8 each showed a great improvement on previous years.", "1986\u201387 commenced with the visit of Forfar, the Pars squeezed a 1\u20130 win with a goal from John Watson and were up and running.  Three more wins followed and the newly promoted men were top of the league.  Their next visitors were East Fife who were yet to win in their start to the season.  The form book was cturned on its head with East Fife racing into a 3\u20130 half-time lead. Dunfermline scored two in the second half but the visitors added another to triumph 4\u20132. David Moyes was substituted and this was to be the final appearance in his brief Dunfermline career. Ian Heddle was introduced to the line up in subsequent games and the Pars returned to form, won the next three games and drew the subsequent two.  The second of which was against league leaders Airdrieonians.  A crowd of more than 5000 watched a 0\u20130 draw.  Hugh Whyte had to temporarily return between the posts for the next two games to cover for Ian Westwater, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over Montrose but losing three in a draw in his final appearance at Forfar.  The team were struggling to maintain consistency and their best form but kept in touch at the top of the league. Early leaders Airdrie were also losing form and were never to recover. Dunfermline had a poor November with wins over Kilmarnock and Montrose balanced by defeats at East Fife (again) and Airdrie and a home 2\u20132 draw with Queen of the South. Athletic managed to climb their way to the top of the league and were to stay there until the end of April. The season ended poorly with five defeats in the last eight games with Morton snatching the championship.  Second place meant promotion again and the promise of matches against Scotland's top division teams in 1987\u201388.  Norrie McCathie was the only ever-present. John Watson was the top scorer for the third year running with a more modest 13 goals.  Ian McCall, in his first season, bagged eight and caught the eye of a number of clubs."]}]}}
