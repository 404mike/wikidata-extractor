It was initially recorded in analogue at Aigle Studio before Dickins requested to have it re-recorded digitally at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London. Watermark was released in September 1988 and became an unexpected hit, reaching number 5 in the United Kingdom and number 25 on the Billboard 200 in the United States following its release there in January 1989. Its lead single, \"Orinoco Flow\", was the last song written for the album. It was not intended to be a single at first, but Enya and the Ryans chose it after Dickins asked for a single from them several times as a joke, knowing Enya's music was not made for the Top 40 chart. Dickins and engineer Ross Cullum are referenced in the songs' lyrics. \"Orinoco Flow\" became an international top 10 hit and was number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks. The new-found success propelled Enya to international fame and she received endorsement deals and offers to use her music in television commercials. She spent one year travelling worldwide to promote the album which increased her exposure through interviews, appearances, and live performances. By 1996, Watermark had sold in excess of 1.2\u00a0million copies in the United Kingdom and 4 million in the United States."]}, {"page": "Under the Pink", "response": ["* Ross Cullum \u2013 mixing"]}, {"page": "Watermark (Enya album)", "response": ["After a demo version of the album was put down, Dickins requested to have it re-recorded digitally at a more professional studio as the analogue equipment at Aigle had created an abundance of tape hiss, causing the music to suffer. Nicky found the quality of Enya's multi-track vocals had also diminished, leaving them the only option of re-recording them, though he later found the digital recording had lost \"warmth in the bottom end\". Recording took place at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London and lasted for two months with Ross Cullum who carried out co-production, engineering, and mixing duties. \"Storms in Africa\" and \"Orinoco Flow\" were completed on the studio's two Mitsubishi 32-track recording machines. Away from the \"intimate and personal\" setting of their home studio, Enya found working in London more difficult as the busy city caused many distractions. Nicky said the studio was designed \"in a completely mad way\", which he and Enya found more attractive to work in. During the final stages of recording, Enya tripped on a step, which resulted in two cuts to her knee. She continued to work, \"taking these heavy pain-killers, sitting at the desk, in the studio with one foot propped up on cushions.\" Cullum completed the majority of the album's mixing at Wessex Sound Studios; Jim Barton was the mixer on \"Orinoco Flow\".", "* Ross Cullum \u2013 mixing (except \"Orinoco Flow\"), co-producer, recording engineer"]}, {"page": "The Hurting", "response": ["*\u2020 \u2013 The 1999 remastered version of the album incorrectly credits Curt Smith as co-writer and Mike Howlett as producer of \"Pale Shelter\" (Long Version).
