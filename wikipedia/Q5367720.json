She does, however temper this by stating \"despite its flaws, at its best it confirms the unshakeable certainty which possesses anyone who has read Miller's marvellous Ingenious Pain: that here is a writer of very rare and outstanding gifts, no matter what.\". In a review by Michael Arditti, again for The Independent, Arditti states \"Casanova is a deeply disappointing second novel from the author of Ingenious Pain. There is no sense of personal impetus behind the writing, which offers a rehash of well-known images and themes.\" and criticises the \"basic plot\", simple characters and lack of originality.
