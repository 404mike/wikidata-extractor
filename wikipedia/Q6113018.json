They complained about a compensation scheme established by the Government in 2000 in which \u00a310,000 would be offered to surviving members of groups who had been held prisoner.  The Defence Minister, Dr Lewis Moonie, announced that \"British groups\", \"British citizens\" and \"UK citizens\" would be eligible for compensation.  The clarification of this requirement was that a claimant had to have been born in the United Kingdom or had a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom \u2013 the \"bloodlink\".  Complaints were made by many who considered themselves British who could not meet the criteria, including the political scientist Professor Jack Hayward, born in Shanghai to a father born in India and a mother born in Iraq.  Abraham published her report \u2013 A Debt of Honour (after a phrase used by Dr Moonie) \u2013 in July 2005.  She found four instances of maladministration: the scheme was devised hurriedly and with a lack of clarity about eligibility; that the announcement of the scheme was so imprecise as to give rise to confusion; that there was a failure to ensure that the \"bloodlink\" requirement would not lead to unequal treatment; and that there was a failure to inform applicants about the \"bloodlink2 clarification when they were sent an eligibility questionnaire.  The report recommended that the scheme be reviewed so that it would not operate in a way that would unequally treat Hayward and others in a similar situation.  The report was published under s10(3) as the Government only partially accepted the recommendations but refused to accept that there had been inequality of treatment or to review the scheme.  The Select Committee published its own report on the matter, endorsing the recommendations of Abraham, in January 2006.  In March 2006 the Ministry of Defence announced that it had made changes to the eligibility criteria, abandoning the \"bloodlink\" requirement and paving the way for Hayward and others to become eligible for compensation."]}, {"page": "Jack Hayward (academic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Hayward (political scientist)"]}, {"page": "2017 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*8 December \u2013 Jack Hayward, 86, political scientist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2017", "response": ["*Jack Hayward, 86, British political scientist.Jack Hayward: Political scientist whose scholarship on France won him the country\u2019s highest civilian honour"]}]}}
