At the age of eight Edward Langtry, and his three sisters aged nine, six and five were orphaned.  Their financial affairs came under the care of trustees and executors: Henry Fulton, William McEwen and their uncle, Richard Langtry.  At the time of his death Robert Langtry owned numerous properties in Co. Antrim and Co. Down.
