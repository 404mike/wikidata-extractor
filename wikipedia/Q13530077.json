He had taken part in the famous closing of the gates at Hougoumont and was said to have been so disturbed by the incident that he would never again close a door, preferring to sit in a room in a howling draught.  During the battle, his life had been saved by Corporal James Graham, the soldier responsible for slotting the bar home after the North Gate was shut.Pictures of the battles of Battle of Vittoria and Waterloo were commissioned by Wyndham's father from George Jones, RA.
