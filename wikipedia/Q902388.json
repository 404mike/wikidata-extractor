In March 1788 he became assistant to Adair Crawford at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, at a salary of \u00a330 a year.  On 24 June 1802, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carbon monoxide", "response": ["Joseph Priestley is considered to have first synthesized carbon monoxide in 1772. Carl Wilhelm Scheele similarly isolated carbon monoxide from charcoal in 1773 and thought it could be the carbonic entity making fumes toxic. Torbern Bergman isolated carbon monoxide from oxalic acid in 1775. Later in 1776, the French chemist  produced CO by heating zinc oxide with coke, but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was hydrogen, as it burned with a blue flame. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide. Antoine Lavoisier conducted similar inconclusive experiments to Lassone in 1777. The gas was identified as a compound containing carbon and oxygen by William Cruickshank in 1800."]}, {"page": "Strontium", "response": ["Both strontium and strontianite are named after Strontian, a village in Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it was identified as a new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis. During the 19th century, strontium was mostly used in the production of sugar from sugar beets (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75% of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the replacement of cathode ray tubes with other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.", "In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged in the preparation of barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other \"heavy spars\" sources. This allowed Crawford to conclude on page 355 \"...\u00a0it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined.\" The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also came to the conclusion that it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow studied the mineral and proposed the name strontites.Although Thomas C. Hope had investigated strontium ores since 1791, his research was published in:  He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: \"...\u00a0Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion.\" The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to strontium.Many other early investigators examined strontium ore, among them: (1) Martin Heinrich Klaproth, \"Chemische Versuche \u00fcber die Strontianerde\" (Chemical experiments on strontian ore), Crell's Annalen (September 1793) no. ii, pp. 189\u2013202 ; and \"Nachtrag zu den Versuchen \u00fcber die Strontianerde\" (Addition to the Experiments on Strontian Ore), Crell's Annalen (February 1794) no. i, p. 99 ; also (2) "]}, {"page": "Urea", "response": [" although this discovery is often attributed to the French chemist Hilaire Rouelle as well as William Cruickshank."]}, {"page": "Royal Military Academy, Woolwich", "response": ["*William Cruickshank, assistant to Adair Crawford (qv) and later professor of chemistry c.1795\u20131804."]}, {"page": "1790 in science", "response": ["* Adair Crawford, working with William Cruickshank, proposes the existence of the alkaline earth metal located near Strontian in Scotland which will later be isolated at strontium."]}, {"page": "Martin Heinrich Klaproth", "response": ["In 1790 Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank determined that the mineral strontianite, found near Strontian in Scotland, was different from barium-based minerals.

The mechanism for toxicity was first suggested by James Watt in 1793, followed by Adrien Chenot in 1854 and finally demonstrated by Claude Bernard after 1846 as published in 1857 and also independently published by Felix Hoppe-Seyler in the same year."]}, {"page": "Carboxyhemoglobin", "response": ["After the discovery of carbon monoxide by William Cruickshank in 1800, Johann D\u00f6mling (1803) and John Bostock (1804) developed hypotheses suggesting blood returned to the heart loaded with carbon monoxide to subsequently be oxidized to carbon dioxide in the lung prior to exhalation. Later in 1854, Adrien Chenot similarly suggested carbon monoxide could remove oxygen from blood and be oxidized within the body to carbon dioxide. The mechanism for carbon monoxide poisoning in the context of carboxyhemoglobin formation is widely credited to Claude Bernard whose memoirs beginning in 1846 and published in 1857 notably phrased, \"prevents arterials blood from becoming venous\". Felix Hoppe-Seyler independently published similar conclusions in the following year."]}, {"page": "Adair Crawford", "response": ["In 1790, along with his colleague William Cruickshank at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, London, Crawford noted the distinctiveness of strontianite from barium minerals, and may thereby be said to be the discoverer of strontium.

Like Volta, Cruickshank arranged square copper plates, which he soldered at their ends, together with plates of zinc of equal size. These plates were placed into a long rectangular wooden box which was sealed with cement. Grooves inside the box held the metal plates in position. The box was then filled with an electrolyte of brine, or watered down acid. This flooded design had the advantage of not drying out with use and provided more energy than Volta's arrangement, which used brine-soaked papers between the plates."]}, {"page": "History of the battery", "response": ["Volta's original pile models had some technical flaws, one of them involving the electrolyte leaking and causing short-circuits due to the weight of the discs compressing the brine-soaked cloth. A Scotsman named William Cruickshank solved this problem by laying the elements in a box instead of piling them in a stack. This was known as the trough battery. Volta himself invented a variant that consisted of a chain of cups filled with a salt solution, linked together by metallic arcs dipped into the liquid. This was known as the Crown of Cups. These arcs were made of two different metals (e.g., zinc and copper) soldered together. This model also proved to be more efficient than his original piles, though it did not prove as popular."]}, {"page": "1810 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*probable \u2013 William Cruickshank, Scottish military surgeon, chemist and inventor"]}, {"page": "Trough battery", "response": ["The trough battery was a variant of Alessandro Volta's  Voltaic Pile and was invented by William Cruickshank c. 1800."]}, {"page": "Cruickshank", "response": ["* William Cruickshank (chemist) (died 1810), Scottish chemist and military surgeon"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| William Cruickshank||24/06/1802||- ? 1811"]}, {"page": "Samuel Soloveichik", "response": ["Soloveichik was an expert and frequently lectured and wrote in the field of the History of Chemistry.

A further edition appeared in 1806. John Latham supported Rollo's views on the treatment. In 1824 the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica in its article \"Dietetics\" commented that the diet was successful in repressing the condition of the patients' urine, but that the patients often found the high fat content intolerable. This kind of dietary management continued to the 1920s, being more successful for adults, who might survive some years, than for young patients who typically had only some months of life on it.
