His research into the effects of DDE and DDT on eggshells contributed to the ban on DDT in the United States. He proved that the chemicals caused thinning of eggshells, leading to a reduction in the population of various bird species. He also pioneered research on the effects of PCBs on birds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 18", "response": ["*2001 \u2013 David Peakall, English chemist and toxicologist (b. 1931)"]}, {"page": "DDT", "response": ["DDT became a prime target of the growing anti-chemical and anti-pesticide movements, and in 1967 a group of scientists and lawyers founded Environmental Defense (later Environmental Defense Fund, EDF) with the specific goal of enacting a ban on DDT. Victor Yannacone, Charles Wurster, Art Cooley and others in the group had all witnessed bird kills or declines in bird populations and suspected that DDT was the cause. In their campaign against the chemical, the EDF petitioned the government for a ban and filed lawsuits. Around this time, toxicologist David Peakall was measuring DDE levels in the eggs of peregrine falcons and California condors and finding that increased levels corresponded with thinner shells."]}, {"page": "March 17", "response": ["*  1931   \u2013 David Peakall, English-American chemist and toxicologist (d. 2001)"]}, {"page": "Silent Spring", "response": ["In 1996, a follow-up book, Beyond Silent Spring, co-written by H.F. van Emden and David Peakall, was published.

Environmental movements of that time encouraged a move away from the protection of individual species, towards a more holistic approach of protecting various ecosystems and the species that inhabited them. With the signing of the 1974 Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, more funding became available. By 1975 David Peakall as WSC Division Chief was focusing his work on persistent bioaccumulatory organochlorines such as DDT, dieldrin and PCBs. The North American Waterfowl Management Plan (1986) lead to greatly increased funding and partnerships with Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Provinces to protect and enhance upland and wetland habitats for waterfowl, primarily in the Prairie Provinces. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1990) and Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (1994) further supported a need for toxicological research on waterbirds and aquatic ecosystems to support regulations and development decisions. In 1976 the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada brought together experts in all taxa from across the country and began preparing lists of species at risk using criteria consistent with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. By the late 1990s there was political support for a national endangered species law, and in 2002 the Accord for the Protection of Species At Risk in Canada was a precursor to the Species At Risk Act."]}, {"page": "List of Cornell University faculty", "response": ["* David Peakall (1968\u20131975 Laboratory of Ornithology, senior research associate in the Section of Ecology and Systematics in the Biological Sciences Division)"]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* David Peakall (1931\u20132001), toxicologist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2001", "response": ["*David Peakall, 70, British environmental toxicologist and ornithologist."]}, {"page": "Peakall, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Peakall"]}, {"page": "Beyond Silent Spring", "response": ["Beyond Silent Spring: Integrated Pest Management and Chemical Safety. is a 1996 book about environmentalism edited by H.F. van Emden and David Peakall.
