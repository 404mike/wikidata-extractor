Although the action is taken from The Merry Wives of Windsor, some commentators feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare's play into a wholly Italian work. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy: \"it was all done through the music\".Osborne, p. 406 In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in The Observer, \"Because of Shakespeare we like to think of Falstaff as a work that has a certain Englishness. In fact the opera is no more English than Aida is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight into one of the archetypes of opera buffa.\"Heyworth, Peter. \"Falstaff and the Verdi canon\", The Observer, 14 May 1961, p. 26 Verdi himself, however, felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian buffo character, but portrays Shakespeare's fuller, more ambiguous Falstaff of the Henry IV plays: \"My Falstaff is not merely the hero of The Merry Wives of Windsor, who is simply a buffoon, and allows himself to be tricked by the women, but also the Falstaff of the two parts of Henry IV. Boito has written the libretto in accordance.\" A contemporary critic argued that the text \"imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare's verse\", but Hepokoski notes Boito's use of traditional Italian metric conventions."]}, {"page": "Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom", "response": ["Sir Tony O'Reilly, who holds both British and Irish nationality,A person born in the Republic of Ireland before 1949 who holds British nationality may be either a British subject or a British citizen.

However, in practice, the British government would consult the Irish government before offering honorary award to a solely Irish citizen, especially one not resident in the United Kingdom. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the German soprano, became entitled to be known as \"Dame Elisabeth\" when she took British nationality.

Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound\u2014\"part oboe, part clarinet\", as Claudia Cassidy described it\u2014and was noted for its veiled or \"bottled\" sound, as if she were singing into a jug. Walter Legge, husband of diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, attributed this sound to the \"extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth\"."]}, {"page": "Glenn Gould", "response": ["The success of Gould's collaborations was to a degree dependent upon his collaborators' receptiveness to his sometimes unconventional readings of the music. His television collaboration with American violinist Yehudi Menuhin in 1965, in which they played works by Bach, Beethoven and Schoenberg, was called a success by  because \"Menuhin was ready to embrace the new perspectives opened up by an unorthodox view\". His 1966 collaboration with soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, however, recording Strauss's Ophelia Lieder, was deemed an \"outright fiasco\". Schwarzkopf believed in \"total fidelity\" to the score, but objected to the temperature, which was to Gould's liking:The studio was incredibly overheated, which may be good for a pianist but not for a singer: a dry throat is the end as far as singing is concerned. But we persevered nonetheless. It wasn't easy for me. Gould began by improvising something Straussian\u2014we thought he was simply warming up, but no, he continued to play like that throughout the actual recordings, as though Strauss's notes were just a pretext that allowed him to improvise freely.Gould recorded Schoenberg, Hindemith, and Ernst Krenek with numerous vocalists, including Donald Gramm and Ellen Faull. He also recorded Bach's six sonatas for violin and harpsichord (BWV 1014\u20131019) with Jaime Laredo, and the three sonatas for viola da gamba and keyboard with Leonard Rose. Claude Rains narrated their recording of Strauss's Enoch Arden melodrama. Gould also collaborated with members of the New York Philharmonic, the flautist Julius Baker and the violinist Rafael Druian in a recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 4.Kazdin, Andrew (1989).
