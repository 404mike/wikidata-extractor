Kelley ensured that long-term prisoners received the best accommodation and they were allowed to have their own crockery, pictures and curtains. The prison created \"family\" groups of prisoners, group therapy and psychiatrists to support some prisoners where required.", "Holloway's Governor Joanna Kelley was promoted to Assistant Director of Prisons (Women) in 1966. In 1967, they began to rebuild Holloway Prison. The previous design had been a \"star\" design where a single warder could oversee many potentially troublesome prisoners and then act promptly to summon assistance. Kelley felt this was wrong as at the time most women prisoners were not violent. It was her ideas that inspired the redesigned prison based on her experience as governor. It was completed in 1977. During that time she had become an OBE in 1973. The new design allowed for \"family\" groups of sixteen prisoners. Her ideas were in the design of the buildings but her ideas were never enacted."]}, {"page": "Murree", "response": ["Murree became a popular tourist station for British citizens of the British Raj.
