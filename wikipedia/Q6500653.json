The show\u2019s 2017 post-election pilot episode features a sketch in which a newly elected Labour MP is sent to a \"voluntary mandatory reeducation program\" at Labour headquarters to be brainwashed into believing that current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (portrayed by Ullman in series one) has \"defeated Toryism\" and the number of seats won by the party are larger than they appear. A torture technique: sending Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell (portrayed by actor Laurence Howarth) in.", "A sketch featured in the series 2 premiere episode (broadcast on 1 June 2018) drew considerable ire from Labour Party members on social media. The sketch featuring Ullman as current Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn references the political leader's ties to Gerry Adams, former Leader of the Sinn F\u00e9in, a friend of his from Hamas, and focuses on the public debate surrounding antisemitism in the Labour Party and Corbyn's reaction to it. Conspiracy theories and erroneous claims arose on Twitter from Labour supporters that Jewish comedian David Baddiel wrote the sketch's script, that Ullman was Jewish, and that the bit was part of a \"Zionist conspiracy\" against the party. Politicians such as George Galloway were also responsible in pushing the claims. Baddiel, who is an outspoken atheist, who is not a Zionist, and has nothing to do with the show, responded on his Twitter account: \"Been told, hilariously, that Corbynistas like @jigsawman2014 have assumed that I wrote Tracey Ullman's JC sketch on her show: a brilliant example of how they truly eschew the idea of a Jewish conspiracy.\" Baddiel followed up, \"This is the literally the weirdest conspiracy theory I've ever seen. I've now seen it stated as fact that I wrote that sketch. Maybe I should ask for royalties. Or will that confirm the stereotype for the antisemites?\" Ullman, who is not Jewish, is a long-time Labour supporter, like Baddiel. Producer Caroline Norris added, \"I have no idea where [this idea] came from. He'd be on the credits if he'd written a sketch for the show.\"  In reality, the Corbyn sketch was written by Laurence Howarth who also wrote a series of sketches for the show's second series mocking Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Entertainers such as David Schneider, Al Murray, Emma Kennedy, Mitch Benn, a number of journalists, and actress Tracy-Ann Oberman, who's appeared on the show a number of times, came to the series' defense and condemned the antisemitic smears launched against Ullman, Baddiel and the show itself. Shane Allen, the head of BBC comedy commissioning, defended the Corbyn sketches because \"attacking the left, right and centre is part of the whole point of satire.\" He went on to say that comedians and writers shouldn't be afraid of Twitter controversy because \"Twitter is a playground for bullies, arseholes and cowards.\"", "* Laurence Howarth"]}, {"page": "Pilot (Tracey Breaks the News)", "response": ["* Laurence Howarth as Various"]}]}}
