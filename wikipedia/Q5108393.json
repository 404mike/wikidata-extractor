In May 2018, Doctors aired another themed week, based around mental health. The transmission dates coincided with Mental Health Awareness Week. Writer Andrew Cornish felt that due to the seriousness of the topic, it felt \"counter-productive and unrealistic\" to \"drop\" regular characters into numerous mental health-related storylines for that one week, so he planned to have several storylines come to a head in the week. These included Rob Hollins' (Chris Walker) PTSD and Al Haskey's (Ian Midlane) struggle with the diagnosis of his mother's dementia.

However, one ongoing storyline was that of the posse run by Sergeant Callum Stone. While Stone was not borderline corrupt, he used certain methods that were not legal. He was seen as a maverick when he arrived, but one of his biggest secrets came weeks after his arrival in the autumn of 2007; Stone was part of a uniform search for a missing girl, Chloe Parks, but it came to a tragic end when she was found dead at the bottom of a fire escape at a disused hospital. Stone let things get personal when footage emerged of the girl several years earlier stating she was sexually abused by her father Martin (Chris Walker). When he failed to confess in interview, PC Will Fletcher, Family Liaison Officer for the Parks family in the case of Chloe's death, went after him when he assaulted his wife. Finding Martin atop the fire escape where Chloe committed suicide, Stone forced Fletcher off the negotiation before goading Martin into jumping. Fletcher was mortified, but Stone callously told him \"What goes around, comes around\". After initial harsh feelings between the two, Fletcher sought Stone's help in the spring of 2008 when PC Sally Armstrong demanded justice for a suspected rapist who attacked the sister of one Armstrong's friends. Reminding Stone of his \"alternative methods\", Fletcher got him on side, and after the man gave evidence against a suspected drug dealer, Stone joined the arrest team before telling the suspect who was responsible for calling the cops. Taking Fletcher, Armstrong and PC Benjamin Gayle to the home of the suspected rapist, they lay in wait until a group of thugs burst in and savagely assaulted him, responding to the callout and arresting the men responsible. Happy with their alternative justice, the four officers formed a posse. A few weeks later, Armstrong was paired with PC Emma Keane when a burglar was seriously assaulted during a home invasion. Dejected that the victims may end up being prosecuted for defending their home, Armstrong took Keane to Stone to ask if there were any alternatives. Stone was furious that Armstrong asked Keane to get involved, as her father was a DCI at the DPS. Keane, however, thought Stone was harbouring a crush on her and began undermining him. After forcing her way onto an undercover operation, Stone laid down the law as she put herself in danger, attempting to kiss him before pulling out as he was drawn in, stating that her suspicions about him fancying her were confirmed."]}, {"page": "The Fix (1997 film)", "response": ["* Chris Walker as David 'Bronco' Layne"]}, {"page": "List of longest-serving soap opera actors", "response": ["|Chris Walker || Rob Hollins || Doctors || 2009\u2014 ||  years ||"]}, {"page": "Jimmi Clay", "response": ["After being called out to a house in the countryside, Jimmi is kidnapped by siblings Sissy Juggins (Debbie Chazen) and Ivor Juggins (Steven O'Donnell), who are big fans of his radio show.
