Within days of the takeover and still without a manager, the spine of the previous season's team (Carl Asaba, Barry Ashby and Paul Smith) were sold for six-figure fees, with Brian Statham sold later in the month and promising youngster Marcus Bent transfer-listed. Replacements were found in the lower divisions, non-league and in Premier League reserve teams, with Paul Barrowcliff, Derek Bryan, Leon Townley, Ricky Reina and Charlie Oatway arriving for five-figure fees.

Amidst rumours that David Webb had fallen out with chairman Swaisland, Webb resigned as chief executive, but remained on the board of directors. Former Swansea City manager Micky Adams was installed as manager and fared little better, failing to win until mid-December.

Injuries soon began to mount, with first-choice right back Ijah Anderson and summer signings Derek Bryan and Ricky Reina succumbing.
