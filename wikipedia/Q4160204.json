The Benny Hill Show had a music hall-derived format combining live on-stage comedy and filmed segments, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman. Short, bald Jackie Wright was a frequent supporting player who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head."]}, {"page": "2002 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 15 || Jeremy Hawk || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 83 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Call Me Madam", "response": ["Call Me Madam opened in the West End at the London Coliseum on March 15, 1952 for a run of 486 performances: Billie Worth headlined a cast which included Anton Walbrook as Cosmo Constantine and Shani Wallis - in her first major stage role - as Princess Maria.Call Me Madam listing broadwayworld.com, accessed March 3, 2009.
