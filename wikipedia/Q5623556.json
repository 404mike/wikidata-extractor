She came from a noble family, her full name in genealogies being given as Gwerful ferch Ieuan Fychan ap Ieuan ap Hywel y Gadair ap Gruffudd ap Madog ap Rhirid Flaidd. She was the heiress of the mansion of Caer-Gai, near Llanuwchllyn, Merioneth. The name Fychan was later anglicised as Vaughan.\nGwerful was married to Tudur Penllyn, a drover and wool-trader but also a notable poet, and their son Ieuan also wrote poetry which survives in a number of sources. They may also have had a daughter, Gwenllian, though her poetic abilities have been harder to prove.No work definitely ascribed to Gwerful Fychan is known to survive, but the cywydd titled Cywydd y March Glas (the Grey Horse), sometimes ascribed either to Gwerful Mechain or Tudur Aled, has been suggested as her work. Some early antiquaries confuse her with Gwerful Mechain, who was a contemporary. Her memory persisted in the area of Llanuwchllyn as late as the 20th century and a variety of traditional verses were claimed as by her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tudur Penllyn", "response": ["Tudur was married to Gwerful Fychan (Gwerful ferch Ieuan Fychan ap Ieuan ap Hywel y Gadair ap Gruffudd ap Madog ap Rhirid Flaidd, not be confused with Gwerful Mechain), who was herself a poet.

Tudur obtained the fort after marrying Gwerful Fychan, a descendant of Rhirid the Wolf (died c. 1160), and the fort may have been owned by Rhirid when he received the lordship of Penllyn.
