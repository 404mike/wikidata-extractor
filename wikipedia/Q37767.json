Considered one of the 20th century's major poets, he is a central figure in English-language Modernist poetry.\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, he moved to England in 1914 at the age of 25 and went on to settle, work, and marry there. He became a British citizen in 1927 at the age of 39, subsequently renouncing his American citizenship.Eliot first attracted widespread attention for his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" in 1915, which was received as a modernist masterpiece. It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including \"The Waste Land\" (1922), \"The Hollow Men\" (1925), \"Ash Wednesday\" (1930), and Four Quartets (1943). He was also known for his seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and The Cocktail Party (1949). He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948, \"for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edgar Allan Poe", "response": ["Poe describes his method in writing \"The Raven\" in the essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\", and he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. T.\u00a0S. Eliot said: \"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\" Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as \"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization\"."]}]}}
