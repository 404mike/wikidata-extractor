G. Corfield Ltd in Wolverhampton. The company first made accessories for photographers, then launched the Periflex camera in 1953; it also imported Exacta Varex and Minox cameras from East Germany.After a majority holding in the company was bought by Guinness in the early 1960s, he led the expansion of Parkinson Cowan, a maker of gas meters and gas appliances. In 1966 he moved to American company ITT, becoming managing director of their British subsidiary Standard Telephones and Cables in 1969 and then executive chairman from 1979. Here he followed an ambitious expansion strategy, including in 1984 the ill-fated acquisition of computer maker ICL, leading to his resignation the following year.Corfield was also involved in developing the Architect camera and, in partnership with Brian Gould, he purchased the Gandolfi company in 1982 to ensure its future. He was the chair of the Science Museum committee which in 1982 selected Bradford as the home for the National Museum of Photography, Film & Television, later the National Media Museum.\nCorfield was knighted in 1980.

An attempt to enter the mainframe computer market with the takeover of ICL led to financial strains. The rationale was the convergence of computing and telecoms but the vision was too early. Almost immediately, STC had financial problems and ICL was ring-fenced to preserve it as a profit centre.  By 1991, with an ageing workforce, loss of business from the newly privatised BT, production spread over too many expensive sites and no clear leadership succession to its former chairman, Sir Kenneth Corfield, STC was bought by Canadian company Northern Telecom (Nortel).Telecom bid to buy STC New York Times, 9 November 1990Nortel History - 1980 to 1989 "]}, {"page": "Parkinson Cowan", "response": ["*c.1960 to 1966: Kenneth Corfield is chairman."]}, {"page": "K.
