A fast forward, he won League Championship medals with Manchester City and Derby, and scored more than 200 goals in his career. In 2010, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.\nHe holds the English record for the greatest number of penalties scored in a season, a feat which earned him the nickname Lee 1 (Pen) because that was the way his name always seemed to appear on the list of goal scores for City in the match results listings in the Sunday papers. This led to accusations of diving. One such accusation, from Leeds United's Norman Hunter, led to an on-pitch fight.After retiring from football, Lee ran a successful toilet roll business, F.H. Lee Ltd, which made him a millionaire. In 1994, he became the major shareholder and chairman of Manchester City, but stepped down four years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 29", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Francis Lee, English footballer and businessman"]}, {"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["Banks made what he believed to be three of the best saves of his career in a Stoke shirt.
