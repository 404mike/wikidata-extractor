Dick Ray resigned as manager, and was replaced by Billy Hampson. Hampson went for experience and recruited former England internationals, such as Albert McInroy and George Brown. He also introduced promising youngsters Bert Sproston, Billy Furness and Eric Stephenson, who went on to play for England. In the 1934\u201335 season, Leeds adopted a half yellow-half blue strip, in tribute to the defunct Leeds City, and this kit stayed in place until 1948, with several variations on the colours being used between then and 1960\u201361. The club also adopted their first badge in 1934, using the city crest."]}, {"page": "Billy Hampson", "response": ["He had a short stint in charge of Ashington back in the north-east before taking over from Dick Ray as manager of Leeds United in March 1935. They finished 18th at the end of his first season in charge. Hampson felt the team needed experienced players which prompted him to sign former England internationals, goalkeeper Albert McInroy and forward George Brown, in the summer. The signings did not prove to have a great effect on the club's fortunes, but they consolidated their First Division status in the few years before World War II. They avoided relegation by just two points in 1936\u201337. Hampson began to develop a lot of young players, leading to Leeds' only Central League win that same season. He was also known for scouting Ireland for young players. His squad generally consisted of both youth and experience but by the team football officially restarted after the war, in 1946\u201347, these players were well past their best. Hampson stood by his pre-war squad which proved to be the downfall."]}, {"page": "1932 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||1 || Albert McInroy "]}, {"page": "David Fairhurst", "response": ["He was an ever-present in the successful FA Cup campaign in 1932, in which Newcastle defeated Arsenal in the final in rather controversial circumstances. Arsenal took an early lead, when Joe Hulme beat Fairhurst and centred the ball to Bob John who easily beat goalkeeper Albert McInroy. Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball had appeared to go over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies. The referee ruled that the ball had not gone out of play, even though photographic evidence later showed that the ball had actually crossed the line, and the goal stood.
