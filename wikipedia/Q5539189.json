The small British force was under the command of Commander George Farmer. Madariaga wrote to Farmer on 10 June that having with him fourteen hundred troops and a train of artillery, he was in a position to compel the English to quit, if they hesitated any longer. Farmer replied that he should defend himself to the best of his power; but when the Spaniards landed, after firing his guns, Farmer capitulated on terms, an inventory of the stores being taken, and the British were permitted to return to their country in the Favourite."]}, {"page": "French frigate Surveillante (1778)", "response": ["On 6 October 1779, off Ushant, Surveillante, under captain Cou\u00e9dic de Kergoaler, met with the 32-gun HMS Quebec, under Captain George Farmer. A furious, three-and-a-half-hour-long combat ensued. Both ships suffered heavy casualties and were completely dismasted. The battle ended when Quebec, firing through her own sails which covered her gunports, took fire and exploded. Surveillante, her hull leaking, had 30 killed and 85 wounded. Her boat rescued whatever British crew had survived, and British and French sailors then had to work together to keep her afloat. She returned to Brest the next day, and the British are said to have been treated as castaways rather than prisoners of war."]}, {"page": "HMS Seahorse (1748)", "response": ["In 1773 Digby Dent took command, before Seahorse was paid off to undergo another refit.

Quebec had run aground on a submerged rock and had to throw excess weight overboard to refloat her, sacrificing his 12-pound cannon.
