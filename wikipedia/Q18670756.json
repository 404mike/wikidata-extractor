One cartoon, published in 1951 by Antonia Yeoman, portrayed women in a doctor's waiting room, one of whom stated that she had seen eighteen doctors and seven psychiatrists.  Eventually, she had been diagnosed with a 'deep-seated guilt about getting things free from the National Health Service.'  Analysing cartoons about health featured in Punch magazine from 1948, the psychiatrist Bernard Zeitlyn argues that they 'centred on the bonanza of free spectacles, beards and trips abroad' that the NHS would bring.  Cartoonists also portrayed public excitement about the availability of free wigs on the NHS.  In one such example, from January 1949, cartoonist Joseph Lee showed an irate man chasing a child, asking, 'Who's been practising Home Perms on my free National Health Service wig?'"]}, {"page": "Men Only", "response": ["Humour was at the heart of the title, though from the start it carried fiction (including by P.
