He served as head of the department of chemistry at the University of Oxford from 1997 to 2006.Richards is a pioneer in the field of computer-aided molecular design, in particular its application to the pharmaceuticals industry. He was the founding scientist of Oxford Molecular Ltd., and introduced a novel model for the funding of research at Oxford University, which has been copied elsewhere. Richards was one of the scientific co-founders of Oxford Molecular Limited (OMG). The company developed software for modelling of small molecules and proteins, and drug design. Benefiting from the economic and legal changes, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1992, making the university \u00a310 million. The company was worth \u00a3450 million at its peak but was eventually sold for \u00a370 million.  Richards has published more than 300 scientific papers, including 15 books.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Birkenhead School", "response": ["*Graham Richards (born 1939) Head of Chemistry (1997\u20132006) at the University of Oxford."]}, {"page": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory (Oxford)", "response": ["* Graham Richards"]}, {"page": "List of Brasenose College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Professor Graham Richards, head of chemistry at the University of Oxford  (1997\u20132006)", "* Graham Richards, Head of Chemistry (1997\u20132006) at the University of Oxford"]}, {"page": "Mullard Award", "response": ["|1998 ||Graham Richards || ||"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R", "response": ["|Graham Richards||9 May 2018||1 October 1939"]}, {"page": "Tony Marchington", "response": ["In 1988, he started several companies in the areas of intellectual property, drug discovery and biotechnology.
