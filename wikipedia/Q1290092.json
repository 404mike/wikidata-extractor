Some historians, most notably Noel Malcolm, argue that the battle of Kosovo in 1389 did not end with an Ottoman victory and \"Serbian statehood did survive for another seventy years.\" Soon after, Lazar's son accepted Turkish nominal vassalage (as did some other Serbian principalities) and Lazar's daughter was married to the Sultan to seal the peace. By 1459, Ottomans conquered the new Serbian capital of Smederevo, leaving Belgrade and Vojvodina under Hungarian rule until second quarter of the 16th century.", "In the early sixteenth century, a large migration of Albanians into Kosovo resulted in a sizeable ethnic Albanian presence in some parts of Western Kosovo which continued into the next century. Historian Noel Malcolm challenges this view, using Ottoman documents that recorded migrants coming into the Kosovo region from the 15th to the 18th century and Albanian Catholic sources from the 17th century of northern Albania which recorded migrations out of the region, Malcolm argues majority of the migrants into the Kosovo region during this period were not Albanian. The population of Kosovo was also much bigger than that of northern and central Albania and its rate of growth lower. Kosovo was part of the wider Ottoman region to be occupied by Austrian forces during the Great War of 1683\u201399, but the Ottomans re-established their rule of the region. Such acts of assistance by the Austrian Empire (then arch-rivals of the Ottoman Empire), or Russia, were always abortive or temporary at best.Cirkovic. p. 115 Prior to the final conquest, the Turks often took inhabitants as slaves, frequently to Asia Minor In 1690, the Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III led thousands people from Kosovo to the Christian north, in what came to be known as the Great Serb Migration. Anscombe casts doubt on the fact that this exodus affected Kosovo, since there is no evidence that parts of Kosovo were depopulated. Evidence of depopulation can only be found in areas between Ni\u0161 and Belgrade. Some Albanians from Skopje and other regions were displaced in order to fill some areas around Ni\u0161, but there is no evidence that such events took place in Kosovo.The Serbs, Sima Cirkovic.

Critics said that the book was \"marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans\". In late 1999, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota reviewed the book in Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online and while praising aspects of the book also asserted that it was \"shaped by the author's overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths\", that Malcolm was \"partisan\", and also complained that the book made a \"transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false\". In 2006, a study by Frederick Anscombe looked at issues surrounding scholarship on Kosovo such as Noel Malcolm's work Kosovo: A Short History. Anscombe noted that Malcolm offered a \"a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history\" and that his work marked a \"remarkable reversal\" of previous acceptance by Western historians of the \"Serbian account\" regarding the migration of the Serbs (1690) from Kosovo.. \"Noel Malcolm, who offers a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history...

Most of the newly arrived settlers into Kosovo that were recorded in the early Ottoman period had Slavic names rather than Albanian.", "According to Noel Malcolm, except for migrations from Northern Albania, large parts of the Albanian demographic growth in Kosovo was the expansion of a native Albanian population within the Kosovo region itself.", "According to Noel Malcolm, the Albanians that were forced and settled by the Ottomans were mainly the Catholic Kelmendi tribe from the mountains of Northern Albania that had rebelled and held raids against the Ottomans. As a result, the Ottomans forcibly settled them in the plains to control them better. Many of these families returned to Northern Albania while some stayed. Many Albanian Catholic families from the North Albanian mountains migrated after the 17th century into Kosovo and many of these families fled blood feuds or to find better land and make space for a bigger population, many of these families also converted to Islam in the Kosovo region. However, there is no evidence of any large Albanian migrations into Kosovo up until the 17th century. Many scholars have concluded therefore also that the growth of the Albanian population in Kosovo was also largely due to the expansion of an indigenous Albanian population within the Kosovo region itself. From the 18th century and onwards, there was also a migration of Serbian families into the Kosovo region, many of these Serbian families came from Montenegro and neighboring Serb inhabited regions", "Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire and following the Balkan Wars (1912\u20131913), the western part was included in Montenegro and the rest within Serbia. Citing Serbian sources, Noel Malcolm also states that in 1912 when Kosovo came under Serbian control, \"the Orthodox Serb population [was] at less than 25%\" of Kosovo's entire population.", "After the Second World War and the Yugoslavia-Albania split, Yugoslav authorities attempted to downplay links between Albanians of Albania and Kosovo and to implement a policy of \"Turkification\" that encouraged Turkish language education and emigration to Turkey among Albanians. In 1953, an agreement was reached between Tito and Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, the foreign minister of Turkey that promoted the emigration of Albanians to Anatolia. Forced migration to Turkey increased and numbers cited by Klejda Mulaj for 1953\u20131957 are 195,000 Albanians leaving Yugoslavia and for 1966, some 230,000 people. Historian Noel Malcolm placed the number of Albanians leaving for Turkey at 100,000 between 1953\u20131966. Factors involved in the upsurge of migration were intimidation and pressure toward the Albanian population to leave through a campaign headed by Yugoslav police chief Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107 that officially was stated as aimed at curbing Albanian nationalism. Kosovo under the control of Rankovi\u0107 was viewed by Turkey as the individual that would implement \"the Gentleman's Agreement\". At the same time, a new phase of colonisation occurred in the region as Montenegrin and Serb families were installed in Kosovo.

According to Serbian authors T. O. Oraovac and S. S. Djuri\u0107, Du\u0161an's Code also served as the base of the Kanun of Lek Dukagjini, however, most scholars agree that, although there are some similarities between these two sets of law, that conclusion is far-fetched. Soon after the institution of Du\u0161an's Code in Albanian life the Turkish invaders conquered the greater part of the Balkans, and instead of Du\u0161an's Code customary law and several other patriarchal structures of social organisation were thereafter revived, in particular among the Albanians.

Men who had already served in the 13th SS Division were also deployed as guards at a concentration camp in Pristina. Early on, it became clear that most of the division's Muslim Albanian members seemed to be interested only in settling scores with their Christian Serb adversaries, who became the target of numerous atrocities. In order to put a stop to the crimes, the Germans had to disarm battalions of the division in the towns of Pe\u0107 and Prizren and arrest the Albanian officers, with one commanding officer even being sent to prison in Germany. On 14 May 1944, members of the division raided Jewish homes in Pristina, arrested 281 Jews and handed them over to the Germans, who sent them to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. The historian Noel Malcolm describes this event as \"the most shameful episode in Kosovo's wartime history.\" The division was later involved in a massacre of Albanian partisans. It was also responsible for the expulsion of up to 10,000 Slavic families from Kosovo as new Albanian settlers arrived from the poor areas of northern Albania. The arrival of these Albanians was encouraged by Italian authorities, and it is estimated that as many as 72,000 Albanians were settled or re-settled in Kosovo during the war. Between 28 May and 5 July 1944, the division apprehended a total of 510 Jews, communists and other anti-fascists and turned them over to the Germans. It also carried out retaliatory hangings of suspected saboteurs."]}, {"page": "Bosnian Institute", "response": ["The Board of Trustees is chaired by historian Sir Noel Malcolm, alongside Dr. Bojan Bujic, Cambridge historian Dr. Brendan Simms and journalist Melanie McDonagh."]}, {"page": "Brendan Simms", "response": ["Noel Malcolm praised Simms as \"a historian of unusual range and ability\", saying that \"knowing what he wants to say is one of Simms\u2019s strengths\".Europe by Brendan Simms: review, Noel Malcolm, The Telegraph, 15 April 2013 On the whole Malcolm praised the book, though regarding Simms' emphasis on the primacy of foreign policy in European affairs, Malcolm did wonder if there may be counterexamples, such as those where the foreign/domestic distinction is less clear."]}, {"page": "Category talk:English historians", "response": ["List of all pages in category English historians retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.
