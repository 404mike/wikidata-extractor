Bruce-Gardyne was educated at Twyford School, Winchester College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and then served for six years in Foreign Service before becoming a journalist. He was a council member of the Bow Group.\nAt the 1964 general election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for South Angus where the family seats of Gardyne Castle, Finavon Castle and Middleton all stood. He held the seat until the October 1974 general election, when he lost to Andrew Welsh of the Scottish National Party. Bruce-Gardyne was later elected as the MP for Knutsford at a by-election in 1979, but was effectively forced out of the House of Commons when the seat was abolished by boundary changes for the 1983 general election. He was a monetarist but was opposed to the Falklands War and was an independent-minded MP. His well-known publication, Meriden: Odyssey Of A Lame Duck, virulently attacked Tony Benn's creation of the Meriden Workers' Co-operative to continue production of Triumph Motorcycles. He was succeeded in the new Tatton seat by Neil Hamilton. He was created a life peer as Baron Bruce-Gardyne, of Kirkden in the District of Angus, on 7 October 1983.He married Sally Louisa Mary Maitland, daughter of Commander Sir John Maitland, in 1959. He died of a brain tumour in Kensington and Chelsea at the age of sixty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jock Bruce-Gardyne"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jock Bruce-Gardyne"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jock Bruce-Gardyne"]}, {"page": "Dick Douglas", "response": ["He first stood for Parliament at South Angus in the 1964 General Election, but was beaten by the Conservative Jock Bruce-Gardyne.
