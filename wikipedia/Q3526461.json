Martin played first-class cricket between 1885 and 1892, primarily for Kent County Cricket Club, and appeared twice in Test matches for the England cricket team. He was considered one of the best left-arm spin bowlers in the country between 1889 and 1891.Martin was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1892 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. He took six wickets in both innings of his Test debut in 1890, the first time any player had taken two five wicket hauls in his debut Test match. His 12 wickets for 102 runs in the match were the best match figures for a debutant in Test cricket at the time and remained so until 1972. They remain the best match figures for an England player on debut.\nHe took 100 first-class wickets in a season six times and took four wickets in four balls playing for MCC in 1895.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1891 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Great Bowlers \u2013 William Attewell, J T Hearne, Frederick Martin, Arthur Mold, John Sharpe"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Frederick Martin"]}, {"page": "1890 English cricket season", "response": ["|Frederick Martin || England, Kent, MCC, South || 29 || 8,507 || 190 || 13.05"]}, {"page": "1891 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five Great Bowlers) - William Attewell, J T Hearne, Frederick Martin, Arthur Mold, John Sharpe ", "|Frederick Martin || Kent || 15 || 4267 || 98 || 13.10", "|Frederick Martin || Kent, MCC, Players, South of England || 22 || 5735 || 140 || 13.37\t"]}, {"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["Some of Palairet's early success can be attributed to his father, who paid the professionals Frederick Martin and William Attewell, both later Wisden Cricketers of the Year, to bowl at his two sons during the Easter holidays, to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season. During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club. At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition. Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at Cattistock in Dorset, and it was in the south west that he chose to play his cricket.
