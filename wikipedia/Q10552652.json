It took a while to make his way into the first team, but by the time he left he had made 117 appearances over six seasons for the Division 2 club, and he'd netted 15 goals.He then had a short spell at Midland League King's Lynn before returning to his native Scotland and briefly playing for Third Lanark in the Scottish First Division. Apparently Doncaster were paid \u00a3500 for Herbert without the approval of the Third Lanark board, so the manager was forced to pay this back out of his own pocket, although stole it back before being dismissed from his post.Following an unsuccessful time at Third Lanark, he dropped down a league to Albion Rovers where he spent four seasons. Lastly he played league football for a season at Brechin City who finished bottom of the league that season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Herbert (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Bobby Herbert (1925\u20132006), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Paddy Gavin", "response": ["In 1955\u201356, he was again second in line behind Graham, only playing twelve games, however he did score his only Doncaster goal in that season. It was during a home game against Lincoln City on 27 December, the day after playing them away at Sincil Bank, and Rovers were winning 1\u20130 when a penalty was awarded. The regular penalty taker, Bobby Herbert, wasn't playing so Gavin took it and scored in front of the 18,323 Belle Vue crowd."]}]}}
