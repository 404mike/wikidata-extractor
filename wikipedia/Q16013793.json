He played for Essex between 1935 and 1954.Sonny Avery was a right-handed opening batsman, \"a good player of in-swing and a powerful cutter who held the bat low down and often suffered injured hands as a result\". He and Dickie Dodds formed a strong opening partnership for Essex in the seasons after the Second World War. He played in a Test trial match in 1946 when England were looking for new players, top-scoring with 79 in the first innings of the Rest of England team, but was never selected for the national team.A few days before the Test trial he had scored 210 for Essex against Surrey at The Oval. Surrey had been dismissed for 162 on the first afternoon, and by stumps Essex were 235 for no wicket, Avery on 140 not out. Essex went on to win by an innings.Avery made 1000 runs in a season seven times. His 25 centuries included four double-centuries, with a highest score of 224 against Northamptonshire in 1952.After his playing career ended he coached Gloucestershire and at Monmouth School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Essex matches were noted for high scores as Essex themselves scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most. Their two outstanding players were the cousins Peter and Ray Smith who both completed the double. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect Trevor Bailey was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder Frank Vigar took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain Tom Pearce, Chick Cray, Dickie Dodds and Doug Insole. Wicketkeeper Tom Wade had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped. Essex were also represented by Bill Dines, Bill Morris, Denys Wilcox, Dick Horsfall, Frank Rist, Harry Crabtree, Len Clark and Sonny Avery.Playfair, pp. 100\u2013102."]}, {"page": "Frank Vigar", "response": ["As the 1951 season progressed, Vigar also became involved with the Ilford cricket school, the first of its kind in Essex. Along with Trevor Bailey, Sonny Avery and Bill Morris, Vigar assisted Harold Faragher in its development."]}, {"page": "Edward Highton", "response": ["Highton made his debut for the Lancashire Second XI against the Warwickshire Second XI in the 1949 Minor Counties Championship. He made 27 further appearances for the Lancashire Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against Cheshire in 1952. Playing minor counties cricket for the Lancashire Second XI allowed him to be selected for a combined Minor Counties cricket team in 1950, making his first-class debut for the team against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1950. Batting first, the Marylebone Cricket Club were dismissed for 127, with Highton taking the wickets of Maurice Crouch and Adam Powell to finish with figures of 2/26 from thirteen overs. The Minor Counties were then dismissed for 172, with Highton scoring 2 runs before he was dismissed by Fred Titmus. Responding in their second-innings, the Marylebone Cricket Club made 229 all out, with Highton taking figures of 4/87 from 25 overs. Chasing 185 for victory, the Minor Counties were dismissed for 129, with Highton last man out when he was dismissed by Francis Appleyard. The following season, he made his only first-class appearance for Lancashire against Essex at Castle Park Cricket Ground, Colchester, in the County Championship. Essex won the toss and elected to bat first, making 384/8 declared in their first-innings, with Highton taking a single wicket, that of Sonny Avery to finish with figures of 1/49 from ten overs. Lancashire were then dismissed for 286 in their second-innings, with Highton scoring 6 runs before he was dismissed by Bill Greensmith. Essex then reached 40/2 declared in their second-innings, at which point the match was declared a draw."]}, {"page": "Dickie Dodds", "response": ["Dodds went straight into the Essex first team when he joined the county and made an impact as an opening batsman in his first match, against Sussex at Ilford, when his second innings of 63 was by some distance the highest score in a final innings which saw Essex lose nine wickets but hang on for a draw. A little over a month later, Dodds and Sonny Avery set an Essex first-wicket partnership record with a stand of 270 in the match against Surrey at The Oval; at this stage, Dodds was not yet following his \"instruction\" to hit the ball hard, and Avery comfortably outscored him, making 140 out of 235 on the first day \u2013 Dodds was 83 not out at close of play. He went on the following morning to his first first-class century, finishing with 103. Later in the season he improved on that with a second century, a score of 111, in the match against Hampshire at Westcliff, and he finished the season with 1050 runs at an average of 25.60."]}, {"page": "Alfred Avery", "response": ["#REDIRECTSonny Avery"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 1997", "response": ["*Sonny Avery, 82, English cricketer."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Returning Essex players in 1919 included Percy Perrin, Johnny Douglas, Frank Gillingham, John Freeman, Jack Russell, George Louden and Joseph Dixon.
