He predominantly played as a winger, but was also able to play as a striker.\nAlderson, who was born in Dundee, began his career with local youth side Lochee Harp before becoming a professional with Coventry City. He made his league debut against Chelsea on 20 September 1970. Alderson spent five years at Highfield Road, twice finishing as Coventry's top goalscorer, before moving to Leicester City in mid-1975. He spent three years with Leicester, although he was no longer a regular during his final season, 1977\u201378, owing to injury.\nIn 1978 Noel Cantwell, who had managed Alderson during his spell at Coventry, invited him to play for the newly formed New England Tea Men of the North American Soccer League. Alderson spent two years at the club before concluding his outdoor career with a two-year spell at the Atlanta Chiefs. He ended his career playing indoor football for the New Jersey Rockets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  Brian Alderson 17", "|  Brian Alderson 15", "|  Brian Alderson 8 David Cross 8"]}, {"page": "Kate Greenaway Medal", "response": [":\u2013 \tMichael Foreman, Popular Folk Tales (Gollancz), newly translated from Brothers Grimm by Brian Alderson"]}, {"page": "Brian", "response": ["*Brian Alderson (1950\u20131997), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1997 in association football", "response": ["*April 23 \u2013 Brian Alderson (46), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1950 in association football", "response": ["* May 5 \u2013 Brian Alderson, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Lochee Harp F.C.", "response": ["* Brian Alderson"]}, {"page": "Michael Foreman (author/illustrator)", "response": ["* 1978 Popular Folk Tales (illustrator) Gollancz, newly translated from Brothers Grimm by Brian Alderson \u2014a Greenaway runner up,"]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Brian Alderson", "|align=left| Brian Alderson", "|align=left| Brian Alderson", "|align=left| Brian Alderson", "|align=left| Brian Alderson", "|align=left| Brian Alderson", "|align=left| Brian Alderson David Cross", "|align=left| Brian Alderson"]}, {"page": "Alderson (surname)", "response": ["*Brian Alderson, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Alderson, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Alderson"]}]}}
