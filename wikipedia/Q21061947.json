In the summer of 2015 Stevenson was working on his father's farm setting up his own campsite business while playing for Devon and Torquay Cricket Club when he was spotted by Hampshire director of cricket Giles White who offered him a trial at Hampshire to play 2nd XI cricket. He made his Hampshire debut in an LV County Championship match against Durham at the Riverside Ground on 1 September 2015.Stevenson announced his retirement from professional cricket on 8 October 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["In the winter of 2015 Hampshire completed the signing of England seamer Reece Topley from Essex. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and South African all rounder Ryan McLaren had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's Twenty20 competition against the other team. On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers. The Vipers then won the inaugural Kia Super League on 21 August, defeating Western Force in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star Suzie Bates was named as player of the tournament. For the male team though it was a season of disappointment. A large number of injuries at the start of the season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, Chris Wood and Ryan Stevenson, coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler Hamza Ali in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman Michael Carberry being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the Natwest t20 Blast, where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the Royal London One-Day Cup. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against Durham on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement. Coach Dale Benkenstein departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by Craig White originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer James Tomlinson retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw on Kolpak deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire. On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated Warwickshire meaning relegation for Middlesex, with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners Nottinghamshire. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over Derbyshire scoring 249\u20138, with Pakistan overseas player Shahid Afridi scoring a century."]}, {"page": "King Edward VI Community College", "response": ["* Ryan Stevenson, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Ryan Stevenson", "response": ["Ryan Stevenson may refer to:", "* Ryan Stevenson (cricketer) (born 1992), English cricketer", "* Ryan Stevenson (drummer) (born 1987), Canadian drummer and singer", "* Ryan Stevenson (footballer) (born 1984), Scottish footballer", "* Ryan Stevenson (singer) (born 1979), American Christian musician, singer, guitarist"]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club in 2017", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|47|| Ryan Stevenson ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm fast-medium ||"]}]}}
