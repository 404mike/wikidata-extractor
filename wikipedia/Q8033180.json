The Sumo Family debuted in Escape magazine, and was serialised weekly in the Independent on Sunday newspaper in the UK, then monthly in both Manga Mania magazine, and German/Swiss Instant magazine. The Liberty Cat was published in Japan by Kodansha in Morning magazine.Phoenix's critical essays on comics have appeared in catalogues for exhibitions at the ICA in London, and at the University of Sussex. Books he has authored include a children's book titled Count Milkula: A Tale of Milk and Monsters! (ISBN 9780954657659); a cultural study Plastic Culture: How Japanese Toys Conquered the World (ISBN 978-4-7700-3017-7), an in-depth look at Japanese toy designs from the post-war era to present times, and their effect on the imaginations and Western markets along with their impact on trends in design and pop culture;In 2011 Phoenix edited and directed the production of Nelson from an original idea by Rob Davis. Nelson was a groundbreaking \"collective graphic novel,\" with 54 creators producing chapters of a single continuing story, a unique storytelling experiment that won huge critical acclaim. Published by Blank Slate Books, it was The Guardian newspaper's Graphic Novel of The Month, November 2011. The Times newspaper awarded it Best Graphic Novel of 2011, it was nominated for an Eisner Award and was voted Book of The Year in the British Comic Awards 2012.In 2012, for Blank Slate Books, Phoenix wrote and designed Felt Mistress: Creature Couture (ISBN 978-1-9066533-2-3), a book with similar design and pop-cultural concerns to Plastic Culture, focused on the work of a creative duo from Wales, Louise Evans and Jonathan Edwards.\nIn spring 2014 Phoenix completed a new graphic novel She Lives, unusual for its surprising size and dramatic presentation: a 96-page handmade, handbound book that is one metre square. The book is hardcover with an austere black surface featuring embossed giant type. Each interior page is composed of images drawn by hand in India ink rather than printed, making the entire book a one-off piece of original comics art. In a further challenge to standard comics production, Phoenix intends not to print this work so that it can only be viewed in person wherever it is exhibited.
