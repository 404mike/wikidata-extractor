In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. The programme's cliffhangers sometimes caused controversy, most notably Part Three of The Deadly Assassin (1976), which was altered for future broadcasts following a complaint from campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse objected to the violence of the scene (the Doctor's head is held underwater in an attempt to drown him). She often cited it in interviews as one of the most frightening scenes in Doctor Who, her reasoning being that children would not know if the Doctor survived until the following week and that they would \"have this strong image in their minds\" during all that time. The producer of Doctor Who at the time, Philip Hinchcliffe, cited the 1950s radio serial Journey into Space as an influence for its use of cliffhangers. A later serial, Dragonfire (1987), is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved the Seventh Doctor literally hanging from a cliff, which has been described as \"the most ludicrous ever presented in Doctor Who\". Another British science fiction series, Blake's 7 (1978-81), employed end-of-season cliffhangers for each of the four seasons the series was on air, most notably for its final episode in 1981 in which the whole of the main cast are seemingly killed. The final cliffhanger was never resolved."]}, {"page": "Tom Baker", "response": [" Baker was working on a construction site at the time, as acting jobs were scarce.

Under Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes the series gained a \"Gothic tone\" influenced by Hammer Film Productions and, according to Hinchcliffe, was aimed \"a bit more to the adults in the audience\".", "Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part, and his incarnation is often regarded as the most popular of the Doctors. According to BBC News in 2006, in polls conducted by Doctor Who Magazine, Baker had only lost the \"Best Doctor\" category to Sylvester McCoy in 1990 and to David Tennant in 2006. In a 2010 interview, Baker said that he had not watched Tennant's performance as the Doctor but thought his Hamlet was excellent. Many of the stories from his early period are considered to be classics of the series, including The Ark in Space (1975), Genesis of the Daleks (1975), The Brain of Morbius (1976), The Deadly Assassin (1976) and The Robots of Death (1977). However, the violent tone of the stories produced by Philip Hinchcliffe saw the series come under heavy criticism from morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Concerns over violence during this early period led to a lightening of the tone and an \"erratic decline\" in both the popularity and quality of the series. In a 2014 interview, Baker described Hinchcliffe as \"amazing\" and identified that as his favourite period of his time on the series. He described Hinchcliffe's successor, Graham Williams, as \"absolutely devoted\" but lacking his predecessor's flair and \"let me get away with murder\". He acknowledged that his final producer on the series, John Nathan-Turner, made changes he did not agree with and they \"did not see eye-to-eye really about very much\"; however, according to Baker, the two became good friends afterwards and forgot their disagreements. Baker additionally criticised season 18, his last on the show and Nathan-Turner's first as producer, for an increase in the regular cast, which resulted in what Baker saw as stories that were excessively reliant on the Doctor (rather than other principal characters) to drive the plot forward. Baker ultimately suggested that he may have stayed in the role for one series too many, stating in hindsight that he felt it would have been better for him to have left with Williams and let Nathan-Turner recast the role of the Doctor for season 18."]}, {"page": "Journey into Space", "response": [" Kenny Everett, John Major, Stephen Hawking, Miriam Margolyes and former Doctor Who producer Philip Hinchcliffe.Voice-over commentary on the BBC DVD The Robots of Death (1977, 2000)", "Philip Hinchcliffe has acknowledged growing up listening to Journey Into Space, citing in particular its cliffhangers, as an influence on his period as producer of the science-fiction television series Doctor Who between 1974 and 1977."]}, {"page": "Mary Whitehouse", "response": ["Doctor Who met with her heaviest disapproval during Philip Hinchcliffe's tenure as producer between 1975 and 1977.

In addition, Marks had been reading science magazine articles about antimatter, and decided to write a story incorporating the subject. Hinchcliffe, in the first season in which he could commission new material, planned to move away from the \"rubber-suited alien\" theme, which he felt was clich\u00e9d. For this story he proposed having three separate monstrous elements: Sorenson's transformation, the anti-matter monster and finally the planet itself, claimed by Sorenson in episode 1 to be conscious of his group's motives.\"A Darker Side\" documentary on the making of the serial (BBC DVD 1814)", "Despite the jungle setting of this serial, the shoot was entirely studio bound, and designer Roger Murray-Leach built an intricately detailed jungle set. The BBC was so impressed with it that they kept photographs of it for several years as an example of excellent set design and producer Philip Hinchcliffe recommended that he be nominated for an award for this work."]}]}}
