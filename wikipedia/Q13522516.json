In a review of another work by the MRS Bulletin in 2011, the book was said to be \"the indispensable work on electronic systems for experimental condensed matter physicists\", due largely to the book's \"lucidity and panache\". The book is also recommended in other textbooks on condensed matter physics, including The Solid State by Harold Max Rosenberg in 1979, where it is called a \"detailed, higher-level, modern treatment.\" The textbook Solid-State Physics for Electronics by Andre Moliton states in the foreword that the book aims to prepare students to \"use by him- or herself the classic works of taught solid state physics, for example, those of Kittel and Ashcroft and Mermin.\" Along with Kittel, the textbook Introduction to Solid State Physics and Crystalline Nanostructures by Giuseppe Iadonisi, Giovanni Cantele, and Maria Luisa Chiofalo included the book in the \"Acknowledgements\" section as \"special mentions\". It is also called one of the standard textbooks of solid state physics in the textbook Polarized Electrons In Surface Physics. In a 2003 article detailing Mermin's contributions to solid state physics, the book was said to be \"an extraordinarily readable textbook of the subject, which introduced a whole generation of solid state specialists to a subtle and elegant way of doing theoretical physics.\" The book, along with Kittel is also used as a benchmark for other books on solid-state physics; the publisher's description for the book Advanced Solid State Physics by Philip Phillips that was supplied to the Library of Congress for its bibliography entry states: \"This is a modern book in solid state physics that should be accessible to anyone who has a working level of solid state physics at the Kittel or Ashcroft/Mermin level.\""]}]}}
