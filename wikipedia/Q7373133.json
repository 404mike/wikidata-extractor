This, unlike many rivalries, is generally friendly as both sets of fans live and work together given their close geographic locations.  Due to the geographical proximity of the clubs and despite the rivalry, Inverness CT have signed many former Ross County players over the years, including Barry Wilson, Stuart Golabek, Roy McBain, Graham Bayne, Richard Hastings, Steven Hislop, John Rankin, Andrew Barrowman, Lionel Djebi-Zadi and Don Cowie. Many former Inverness CT players have also \"crossed the bridge\" in the opposite direction, most notably Grant Munro, Michael Fraser,  Ross Tokely and Coll Donaldson in recent years. Both Stuart Golabek and Andy Barrowman had two spells at County each, with the former also having two spells at ICT. A notable player is Iain Vigurs, who is one of (if not the first) few player(s) to cross the bridge more than twice, having spent two spells with both County and Caley Thistle."]}, {"page": "Dyce Academy", "response": ["*Roy McBain - footballer"]}, {"page": "Dundee derby", "response": ["|   1995 ||  Roy McBain ||Unknown", "* Roy McBain"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Aberdeen F.C. season", "response": ["Aberdeen began their SPL campaign with a 2\u20130 loss at home to North 'rivals' Inverness Caledonian Thistle through goals from Andrew Barrowman and Roy McBain. It was the first time that Aberdeen had been beaten by Inverness, having played them 17 times previously. The Dons travelled to Motherwell for their second game, The match was goalless until four minutes from time, when summer signing Charlie Mulgrew scored from a free-kick, to give Aberdeen their first win. Aberdeen then hosted Glasgow rivals Rangers. Veteran Scotland defender David Weir opened the scoring for the visitors, Derek Young followed up after Lee Miller's shot was blocked by rangers keeper Allan McGregor; to score Aberdeen's first goal of the new season at Pittodrie. The match ended 1\u20131, but aberdeen were fortunate as DaMarcus Beasley seemed to have won it for Rangers in stoppage time; his goal was disallowed for offside he was however clearly onside. Aberdeen then travelled to Paisley to play St Mirren. A mistake by the St Mirren defence allowed Darren Mackie to score a goal just before half-time, which proved to be the winner."]}, {"page": "North derby", "response": ["| align=\"left\"|  Roy McBain || Inverness Caledonian Thistle || 3 || \u2013 || \u2013 || 3"]}, {"page": "2003 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||10|| Roy McBain "]}, {"page": "Highland derby", "response": ["* Roy McBain"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["| Roy McBain"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["|Roy McBain"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Peterhead F.C. season", "response": ["| Roy McBain", "| Roy McBain"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Peterhead F.C. season", "response": ["|||MF||Roy McBain", "|  Roy McBain", "|  Roy McBain"]}, {"page": "Ross County F.C.
