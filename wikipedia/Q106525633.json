This included being the co-commentator on the FA Cup Final in both 1949 and 1950, and on coverage of England's matches against Scotland and Italy in April and November 1949, all alongside the BBC's main television football commentator of the time Jimmy Jewell.\nLloyd subsequently worked for the commercial ITV network following its launch in 1955, commentating for them on more than one FA Cup Final and on the 1958 World Cup. In the 1950s and 60s he also provided commentary for ITV on other sports such as figure skating and cricket, as well as on non-sporting events including royal wedding broadcasts in 1960 and 1961.
