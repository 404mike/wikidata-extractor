He is notable for having given, alongside former England captain Billy Wright, the first ever live television commentary on an English Football League match, when the second half of Blackpool versus Bolton Wanderers was shown by ITV on 10 September 1960.Lloyd had previously worked for BBC Television, providing live commentary on various football games from 1948 until 1955. This included being the co-commentator on the FA Cup Final in both 1949 and 1950, and on coverage of England's matches against Scotland and Italy in April and November 1949, all alongside the BBC's main television football commentator of the time Jimmy Jewell.\nLloyd subsequently worked for the commercial ITV network following its launch in 1955, commentating for them on more than one FA Cup Final and on the 1958 World Cup. In the 1950s and 60s he also provided commentary for ITV on other sports such as figure skating and cricket, as well as on non-sporting events including royal wedding broadcasts in 1960 and 1961. Lloyd also worked as a presenter, fronting ITV's Seeing Sport. This was a programme aimed at younger viewers, later described by The Stage newspaper as having been \"the only regular and popular sports programme\" of the network's early years. By the time of the publication of that article in The Stage in September 1976, Lloyd had died.In November 1958 he overpowered an intruder who had invaded a neighbour's house; the neighbour's 11-year-old son having run to Lloyd's home to ask for help.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Lloyd", "response": ["Peter Lloyd may refer to:", "* Peter Lloyd (mountaineer) (1907\u20132003), British climber and engineer", "* Peter Lloyd (aviator) (born 1920), Australian sporting aviator and administrator", "* Peter Lloyd (commentator) (1920\u2013not later than 1976), British television football commentator", "* Peter Lloyd (gymnast) (born 1949), Australian Olympic gymnast", "* Sir Peter Lloyd (politician) (born 1937), British Conservative Party politician, Member of Parliament, 1979\u20132001", "* Peter Lloyd (illustrator) (1944\u20132009), British-born American illustrator", "* Peter Lloyd (journalist) (born 1966), foreign correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Football League", "response": ["This season saw the first ever live television coverage of a Football League game, when ITV broadcast the second half of Blackpool versus Bolton Wanderers on September 10, 1960, with commentary from Peter Lloyd and Billy Wright"]}, {"page": "1960 in British television", "response": ["*10 September \u2013 ITV broadcasts the first live Football League match to be shown on television, and the last for 23 years.
