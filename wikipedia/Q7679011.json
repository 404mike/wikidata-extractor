Among his best-known work is The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's. He was a regular and prolific contributor to The Boy's Own Paper (B.O.P.), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a standard work on the subject: History of the Old English Letter Foundries.\nReed's father, Charles Reed, was a successful London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing as a vehicle for moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.\nIn 1881, following the death of his father, Reed became head of the company. By then he had begun his monumental history which was published in 1887. Along with his B.O.P. contributions Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the Leeds Mercury. He was a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the Bibliographical Society, and a trustee for his family's charities. All this activity may have undermined his health; after struggling with illness for most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41. Tributes honoured him both for his contribution to children's fiction and for his work as the definitive historian of English typefounding.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Talbot Baines Reed (1852\u20131893) \u2013 The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's"]}, {"page": "School and university in literature", "response": ["* Talbot Baines Reed: The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's"]}, {"page": "1894 in literature", "response": ["*Talbot Baines Reed \u2013 Tom, Dick and Harry"]}, {"page": "1881 in literature", "response": ["*Talbot Baines Reed \u2013 The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's"]}, {"page": "Talbot (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Talbot Baines Reed (1852\u20131893), English writer"]}, {"page": "Didone (typography)", "response": ["Didone types were developed by printers including  Firmin Didot, Giambattista Bodoni and Justus Erich Walbaum, whose eponymous typefaces, Bodoni, Didot, and Walbaum, remain in use today. Their goals were to create more elegant designs of printed text, developing the work of John Baskerville in Birmingham and Fournier in France towards a more extreme, precise design with intense precision and contrast, that could show off the increasingly refined printing and paper-making technologies of the period. (Lettering along these lines was already popular with calligraphers and copperplate engravers, but much printing in western Europe up to the end of the eighteenth century used typefaces designed in the sixteenth century or relatively similar, conservative designs.) These trends were also accompanied by changes to page layout conventions and the abolition of the long s.Bodoni, Giambattista. Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition [serial online].

Their designs were popular, aided by the striking quality of Bodoni's printing, and were widely imitated.", "One influential example in the late nineteenth century was William Morris's Kelmscott Press, which commissioned new custom fonts such as his Golden Type on medieval and early Renaissance models. Many fine press printers imitated his model, and while some printers such as Stanley Morison in the twentieth century found his work excessive, it was heavily imitated. Talbot Baines Reed in 1890, shortly before his company cast type for Morris, commented on a desire among typefounders to move back to earlier models: \"types appeared leaning this way and that, flowery and stringy, skeleton and fat, round and square...until it became almost a merit that the original shape was barely recognisable. I am not describing a thing of the past. Herod is out-heroded every week in some new fancy which calls itself a letter...I do not deny that may of our modern fancy letters are graceful...nor am I bold enough to suggest that at this time of day they can be dispensed with. But I admit to some misgivings at the lengths to which the craze is carrying us, and the almost total abandonment of traditional models which it involves.\""]}, {"page": "School story", "response": ["====Talbot Baines Reed====", "Talbot Baines Reed wrote a number of school stories in the 1880s, and contributed considerably to shaping the genre, taking inspiration from Thomas Hughes. His most famous work was The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's (1887) (serialised 1881\u201382). It was reprinted on a number of occasions, selling 750,000 copies in a 1907 edition. While seated in Baines Reed's Christian values, The Fifth Form at St Dominic's showed a definite leaning from the school story as instructional moral literature for children and with greater focus on the pupils and a defined plot.", "However, the core school story theme of the school as a sort of character in itself, actively formed by the pupils and their enjoyment of being there, is primarily a British and American phenomenon. In France, M\u00e9moires d'Un Coll\u00e9gien (1882) by Andr\u00e9 Laurie (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paschal Grousset), set in a boarding-school context similar to Talbot Baines Reed's St. Dominic's in England and Arthur Stanwood Pier's St. Timothy's in America,\"Arthur Stanwood Pier\" by William C. Dowling would have a considerable influence on French stories in the genre. German school stories tended to be written for adults, in the tradition of the earlier Bildungsroman, and explored the disruption the school environment made to a character's sense of individuality. Soviet stories tended to focus on how individualistic behaviour could be corrected and brought into line with collective goals by the school environment. Other notable examples of school stories include Japanese manga series such as Sket Dance and School Rumble; and US dramas such as Beverly Hills 90210, Freaks and Geeks, Glee and Pretty Little Liars."]}, {"page": "Angela Brazil", "response": ["Boys' school stories were popular from the 1870s until the 1930s and continued to find an audience into the 1970s.
