Melua also collaborated with Andrea McEwan on the album, who wrote the lyrics for \"What I Miss About You\" and \"Dirty Dice\". The album also featured a cover of \"In My Secret Life\" by Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson. Melua said of the cover, \"[It] completely got to me, about how we all have great ideals but in reality we end up conforming, following everyone else.\"", "Melua released four singles from the album: \"If You Were a Sailboat\", \"Mary Pickford\", \"If the Lights Go Out\", and \"Ghost Town\". \"Mary Pickford\", written by Mike Batt, was about the silent film star of the same name and the formation of United Artists along with Charlie Chaplin, D W Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks . \"Ghost Town\" was Melua's first reggae-sounding song.", "Melua's fifth studio album, Secret Symphony was released on 5 March 2012 and also debuted high in the UK album chart. The album was produced, arranged and conducted by Mike Batt. Melua said in a statement: \"This album was going to be my 'singer's album'. I had always wanted to do this one day; singing other people's songs brings something out of you and your voice that isn't perhaps where you would have gone vocally with your own material.\"", "Melua's sixth studio album, Ketevan, was released on 16 September 2013. It was co-produced by Mike Batt and his son, singer-songwriter Luke Batt, both of whom contributed songs, separately and in collaboration with Melua. When Ketevan entered the UK charts at number 6, Melua joined a very small group of female artists, which includes Madonna and Kate Bush, who have scored six consecutive UK top 10 studio albums. Ketevan also entered the top 10 in France, Poland, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland in its first week of release.", "Melua's seventh album, In Winter, was released on 14 October 2016. For this record, Melua went back to her native Georgia to record an album with the Gori Women's Choir, a native Georgian all-woman singing troupe. Melua revealed during an interview with The Guardian that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt's Dramatico records."]}, {"page": "Captain Sensible", "response": ["Captain Sensible's recording of \"The Snooker Song\" from Mike Batt's musical The Hunting of the Snark was used as the theme music for the BBC gameshow Big Break, and he also wrote and performed a song called \"Brain's Theme\" for the movie Skinned Deep in 2004."]}, {"page": "The Dreamstone", "response": ["The show was notable for its musical score, which is practically unique among cartoons in that it was performed by a full-size professional orchestra, namely the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The score, by Mike Batt, was heavily characterised by the use of leitmotifs and thematic variations, particularly on the two main songs used in the series, \"Better than a Dream\" (characterising the Noops & Wuts) and \"War Song of the Urpneys\" (characterising the Urpneys).", "Ozzy Osbourne, Frank Bruno, and Billy Connolly provided lead vocals on the \"War Song of the Urpneys\" single and album track, although the version heard in the series was largely sung by composer Mike Batt. Other artists who sang for The Dreamstone soundtrack included Bonnie Tyler, who recorded a duet with Mike entitled \"Into The Sunset\". This song was supposed to be used as the show's official love song (especially towards Rufus and Amberley), but it was never used in the show. Plus Joe Brown and Gary Glitter performed \"The Vile Brothers Mountain Band\", which was used on the show during the episode \"Albert is Fishnapped\".", "The TV version of \"Better Than A Dream\" contained some different lyrics to the version included on the soundtrack. The TV version mostly reflected Rufus's personality, with the lyrics \"I always dream myself to somewhere else each night\" and \"I know I dream much more than other people do\". The soundtrack version contained \"I used to dream myself to someone else each night\" and \"until I chanced upon this road that led to you\", among a few other changes that were made to the song. Mike Batt also re-recorded the chorus, used in the ending credits from the latter part of Series 1 onwards until series 4, in which it was then shortened.
