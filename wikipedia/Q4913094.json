Nesbitt started his football career, aged 16, with his local side, Cornholme, before later joining Portsmouth Rovers. In 1911, he was signed by Burnley manager John Haworth, where he would make almost 200 first-team appearances. Nesbitt was first signed as an amateur, but Haworth gained permission for him to be released from his apprenticeship as a wood turner. With Burnley, Nesbitt won both the FA Cup (1914) and Football League First Division (1920\u201321). He moved to Bristol City in 1923 and had a short spell with Clapton Orient, but in 1924, he was forced to retire from the professional game through injury.\nNesbitt was acutely deaf his whole life. At Burnley, his teammates communicated with him using a variety of methods, including shirt-pulling, hand signalling and lip-reading. When his football career ended, he opened a tobacconist and sweet shop in Paddington, Central London. He returned to Todmorden, and in 1972, he died in hospital in Halifax.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1914 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|MF || || Billy Nesbitt"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["Burnley's league campaign began on 28\u00a0August 1920 with a home match against Bradford City, who had finished 15th in the league in 1919\u201320. The season began inauspiciously for Burnley, beaten 1\u20134, but the match did see eventual top scorer Joe Anderson score the first of his 25\u00a0league goals of the campaign. Two further away defeats followed, 0\u20131 at Huddersfield Town and 0\u20132 at Bradford City, leaving Burnley at the bottom of the league table.Simpson (2007), p. 152 This run of defeats was Burnley's worst start to a league season since 1906\u201307, when they also lost their opening three matches.Simpson (2007), p. 14 Manager Haworth subsequently made several changes to the team; goalkeeper Jerry Dawson and defender Tommy Boyle were reinstated, while Bert Freeman and James Lindsay were dropped in favour of Billy Nesbitt and Benny Cross respectively. Burnley picked up their first win on 6\u00a0September 1920, beating Huddersfield Town 3\u20130 at Turf Moor; the goalscorers were Bob Kelly, Tommy Boyle, and Billy Nesbitt. They went on to defeat Middlesbrough 2\u20131 at home, and to draw with them 0\u20130 at Ayresome Park. On 25\u00a0September 1920, four players scored in a 4\u20130 victory against a weakened Chelsea team, giving Burnley their third successive home win.", "Burnley manager John Haworth used 23\u00a0different players during the 1920\u201321 season, and there were nine different goalscorers. The team played in a 2\u20133\u20135 formation throughout the campaign, with two fullbacks, three halfbacks, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre forward. Billy Watson played the highest number of games, appearing in all 45\u00a0First Division and FA Cup matches. Billy Nesbitt and Joe Anderson each played 43 times. Anderson was the top goalscorer for Burnley in the campaign with 31\u00a0competitive goals, including 25 in the league, the highest total since Bert Freeman's 36\u00a0goals in 1912\u201313.Simpson (2007), p. 129 With a tally of 23 goals, Bob Kelly was the second-highest scorer, followed by Benny Cross with 15, including the goal that won the title for Burnley. Club captain Tommy Boyle was the highest-scoring defender, with seven goals in 38\u00a0league appearances. Winger Billy Nesbitt scored five times during the season.", "|align=\"left\"|Billy Nesbitt"]}]}}
