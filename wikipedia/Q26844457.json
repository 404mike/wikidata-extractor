Pulley describes the myriad images, snippets of backstories, and tales within tales as \"assuredly beautiful\", but recognizes that \"there is no logic that binds these lovely set piece tableaux. Nobody explains why the Starless Sea is honey, or how a honey sea isn\u2019t full of dead flies. The novel reads like panel after panel of mythic illustrations: it expects a certain acceptance of unlikely images\". She writes that some readers might find this approach infuriating, while asserting that this is because it challenges deep-seated conventions of the fantasy genre. She further maintains that The Starless Sea demands to be read on its own terms, not those set in those different times and places readers have come to recognize: \"Rather than a traditional fantasy novel, this is an artificial myth in its own right, soldered together from the girders of skyscrapers \u2013 a myth from and for the US, rather than inherited from older nations. Like any myth, it refuses to decode its own symbols. A reader might find this deliberate vagueness either uplifting or maddening, but the novel\u2019s scope and ambition are undeniable.\""]}, {"page": "Sara Collins", "response": ["The Confessions of Frannie Langton takes the form of the deposition of a woman charged with murder, written for her trial at the Old Bailey in London in 1826. Frannie Langton had grown up as a slave on a Jamaican sugar plantation, where her slave-owner had employed her in his research \"desperate to prove that Africans aren't human\". She was given to George Benham and his French wife in London, and \"Then, in unclear circumstances, the Benhams are murdered\". The book was published in 2019 by Viking, who acquired it shortly before nine companies were due to bid for its rights. Reviewing the book in The Guardian, Natasha Pulley praised it and said \"Between her historical research, Frannie's voice and a plot that never slows to a walk, the novel pulls the gothic into new territory and links it back to its origins.\"  The reviewer in The Irish Times calls the novel \"a beguiling story with strong feminist overtones\". Collins won the First Novel award in the 2019 Costa Book Awards."]}]}}
