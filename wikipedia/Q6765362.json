Cheesman, and two sisters, Emily and Margaret Hunt, who nurtured Gurney's interests in music and literature. Gurney began composing music at the age of 14,Marion Scott Notes, Royal College of Music Library, no date. and won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in 1911. He studied there with Charles Villiers Stanford, who also taught Ralph Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Marion Scott, Rebecca Clarke, Frank Bridge, Arthur Bliss, Herbert Howells and many others. Stanford told Howells that Gurney was potentially \"the biggest of them all\", but he was \"unteachable\".Charles Villiers Stanford quoted by Herbert Howells in \"Ivor Gurney: The Musician\", Music and Letters, vol. 19/1, January 1938, p. 14.", "Gurney possessed a dynamic personality, but he had been troubled by mood swings that became apparent during his teenage years. He had a difficult time focusing on his work at college and suffered his first breakdown in 1913.Pamela Blevins, \"Ivor Gurney and Marion Scott: Song of Pain and Beauty\". After taking a rest, he seemed to recover and returned to college.", "Gurney's studies were interrupted by World War I, when he enlisted as a private soldier in the Gloucestershire Regiment in February 1915. At the front, he began writing poetry seriously, sending his efforts to his friend, the musicologist and critic Marion Scott, who worked with Gurney as his editor and business manager. He was in the midst of writing the poems for what would become his first book, Severn and Somme, when he was wounded in the shoulder in April 1917. He recovered and returned to battle, still working on his book and composing music, including the songs \"In Flanders\" and \"By A Bierside\". Sidgwick & Jackson accepted Severn and Somme in July, with publication set for the autumn. In the meantime, Gurney was gassed in September the same year and sent to the Edinburgh War Hospital, where he met and fell in love with a VAD nurse, Annie Nelson Drummond, but the relationship later broke down. ", "There remains some controversy about the possible effects of the gas on his mental health, even though Gurney had clearly shown signs and symptoms of a bipolar disorder since his teens.Blevins, Pamela, \"New Perspectives on Ivor Gurney's Illness, The Ivor Gurney Society Journal, vol. 6, 2000, pp. 29\u201358; Blevins, Pamela, Ivor Gurney and Marion Scott: Song of Pain and Beauty, The Boydell Press, 2008. \"Being gassed (mildly) [his parenthesis] with the new gas is no worse than catarrh or a bad cold,\" Gurney wrote in a letter to Marion Scott on 17 September 1917. After his release from hospital, he was posted to Seaton Delaval, a mining village in Northumberland, where he wrote poems, including \"Lying Awake in the Ward\". His volume Severn and Somme was published in November 1917.", "In March 1918, Gurney suffered a serious breakdown, triggered at least in part by the sudden breakdown of his relationship with Drummond.Ethel Voynich letter to Marion Scott, March 1938, The Gurney Archive, Gloucester, England He was hospitalised in the Gallery Ward at Brancepeth Castle, County Durham, where he wrote several songs, despite the piano sounding, he said, like \"a boiler factory in full swing because of the stone walls\".Ivor Gurney to Marion Scott, 12 March 1918, Collected Letters, p. 410. In June he threatened suicide, but he did not attempt it.", "Gurney slowly regained some of his emotional stability and in October was honourably discharged from the army. Gurney received an unconventional diagnosis of nervous breakdown from \"deferred\" shell shock. The notion that Gurney's instability should primarily be attributed to \"shell shock\" was perpetuated by Marion Scott, who used this term in the initial press releases after Gurney's death, as well as in his entry for Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians.", "Gurney died of tuberculosis while still a patient at the City of London Mental Hospital, shortly before dawn on 26 December 1937, aged 47. He was buried in Twigworth, near Gloucester. The service was conducted by his godfather, Rev. Alfred Cheesman. Gurney was \"a lover and maker of beauty\", it was stated on his gravestone. (The stone was replaced after it was damaged \u2013 the original is now stored inside Twigworth church.) Marion Scott preserved Gurney's manuscripts and letters and worked with composer Gerald Finzi to ensure that his legacy should not be forgotten.", "Gurney wrote hundreds of poems and more than 300 songs but only set a handful of his own poems to music, the best-known being \"Severn Meadows\". His well-known compositions include his Five Elizabethan Songs (or 'The Elizas' as he called them), written in 1913-14 while he was still a student at the Royal College of Music. The song cycles Ludlow and Teme (published 1923) and The Western Playland, (published 1926), both settings of poetry by A. E. Housman, were prepared for publication with the help of admirers and friends, including Gerald Finzi and his wife Joy, Howard Ferguson and Marion Scott.Chauvin, Ridley (2015). A Performer's Guide to Ivor Gurney's The Western Playland Oxford University Press issued two sets of ten songs in 1938, a year after his death, selected and edited by Finzi and Ferguson.
