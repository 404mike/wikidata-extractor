He helped the club win promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in May 2008, the first time Hull City made it to the top-flight in their 104-year history. In March 2009, Horton was featured heavily in the press after accusing Arsenal club captain Cesc F\u00e0bregas of spitting following an encounter in the FA Cup. F\u00e0bregas was later cleared of any wrongdoing. The \"Tigers\" struggled in the 2009\u201310 season, and Phil Brown was put on gardening leave on 15 March, as Horton and Steve Parkin were appointed as the club's joint-caretaker managers.
