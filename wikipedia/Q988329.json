On the death of Hon. John Robert Morrison, he succeeded him as Chinese Secretary in the Government of Hong Kong, which post he held till his death. He became a very expert Chinese scholar, and prepared a translation of the Bible. He also issued many historical and religious books. He was followed by Rev. Herman Rottger in 1832, who labored in Macau and Hong Kong until 1846, when he retired, and the Netherlands Mission ceased to exist. Dr. G\u00fctzlaff died in 1851."]}]}}
