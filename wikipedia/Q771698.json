On 1 May 1851 it was agreed to abolish the privilege of King's members to be granted a degree without passing the university examinations.  In 1861 the college statutes were amended so as to expand the college and, more radically, to allow for the election of non-Etonian King's members: the new statutes provided for forty-six Fellows, twenty-four scholarships reserved for boys from Eton, and twenty-four \"open\" scholarships for boys from any school.  At the same time all formal obligation to take Holy Orders \u2013 unenforced since the seventeenth century \u2013 was removed.  The statutes were again amended in 1882, this time ensuring fellowships were not always for life and were awarded on merit after submissions of original research.  In his 1930 memoir As We Were, A Victorian Peep Show, E. F. Benson, an alumnus of King's, recollected the peculiar behaviours of some of the surviving Life Fellows from his undergraduate years of 1887\u20131890 and before.

Whether of older or recent origin, the appearance of solid beams and half timbered exterior walls is only superficial. Artificially aged and blackened beams are constructed from light wood, bear no loads, and are attached to ceilings and walls purely for decoration, while artificial flames leap from wrought iron fire-dogs in an inglenook often a third of the size of the room in which they are situated. Occasionally, owners sought to replicate more closely the conditions of Tudor living; an example were the Moynes at Baliffscourt in West Sussex, a house which Clive Aslet describes as \"the most extreme - and most successful - of all Tudor taste country houses\". Lord Moyne's wife, Evelyn, a society hostess, employed the amateur architect Amyas Philips to create a house inspired by the medieval Baliffscourt Chapel which stood on the site.
