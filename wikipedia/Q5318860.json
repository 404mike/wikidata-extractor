However at the 1945 general election, which the Labour Party won in a landslide, White's majority in Fareham was cut to only 5% of the votes.The Fareham constituency was abolished in boundary changes for the  1950 general election, and White did not contest the new Gosport and Fareham constituency.", "link_mentions": {}}}
