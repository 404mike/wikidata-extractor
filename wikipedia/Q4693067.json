The war memorial is one of multiple buildings and structures by Lutyens in the village. He was a friend of two prominent local families, the Horners and the Asquiths, through his collaborations with Gertrude Jekyll on country houses and gardens early in his career. Gertrude's sister-in-law was Dame Agnes Jekyll, the sister of Lady Frances Horner, who was the incumbent owner (with her husband, Sir John) of Mells Manor, a manor house in the centre of the village dating originally from the 16th century. Shortly after their first meeting, Sir John commissioned Lutyens for renovations to the Horners' London town house. Lutyens first visited Mells in 1896 at the request of Lady Horner (with whom he became close friends), who commissioned him to rebuild the house, and later for several other works related to the manor.Gliddon, pp. 323\u2013324."]}, {"page": "Busbridge War Memorial", "response": ["The memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 1 February 1991.

She decided, she said, to study cookery \"in a practical way\", helped by a collection of recipes inherited from her great-grandmother, her grandmother and mother. Her recipe collection was first published in 1935, the year of her husband's death. Despite their position in the higher echelons of British society, the family were \"never particularly well\" off, according to The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and at one point had to withdraw their daughter from boarding school because they could not pay the fees. Unlike other upper-class food writers of the interwar years, such as Agnes Jekyll, Ria Sysonby needed the money that her cookbook brought her. But her love of food was wholly genuine, recalled her friend Lord Esher after her death, in a letter to The Times. He remembered her \"exquisite cookery\", her \"original and charming personality\" and that she demanded \"quality in everything around her\".
