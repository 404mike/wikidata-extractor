Others with him were George Fisher, scientist and chaplain, William Hooper, purser and diarist, lieutenant Henry Parkyns Hoppner and then midshipmen Francis Crozier and James Clark Ross. Experience from the previous voyage led to improvements. The two vessels were nearly identical since Gripper had not been able to keep up with Hecla, and all the equipment was made to be entirely interchangeable. They had cork insulation, cork plugs for the portholes and an improved heating system, coal-burning stove, placed in the lowest deck to deal with cold and condensation. The men were issued better clothing and lemon juice was stored in kegs rather than glass bottles."]}, {"page": "George Fisher", "response": ["George Fisher may refer to:", "*George Fisher (actor) (1891\u20131960), American actor", "*George Fisher (dramatist) (1909\u20131970), Welsh language author", "*George Fisher (journalist) (1909\u20131987), Hollywood gossip columnist and radio personality", "*George Fisher (cartoonist) (1923\u20132003), American political cartoonist", "*George Fisher (1927\u20132005), American actor a.k.a.

It set out at the same time as that of John Ross into Baffin Bay. Both were prompted by the interest of John Barrow in Arctic exploration and the fact that in 1817 whalers reported that the normal ice between Greenland and Spitzbergen had disappeared.This was one year after the year without a summer The ships were HMS Dorothea (Captain Buchan, first lieutenant Arthur Fleming Morrell, astronomer George Fisher) and  under John Franklin who was later famous for his disappearance in the Arctic. They left London on 4 April 1818 and reached Spitzbergen in June. They found that the ice had returned to normal. They entered Magdalena Bay on the west coast where they were frozen in for a few weeks. Escaping the bay they worked their way north through leads in the ice, often dragging the ships with ropes. By early July they were about 30 miles into the ice and could go no further. They were a little north of 80\u00b0, about the same latitude as northernmost Spitzbergen. No European had sailed this far north except William Scoresby. It took only nine days to return to open water, but almost immediately they were hit by a storm which threatened to drive them onto the ice. The storm died down but Dorothea was too damaged to continue in the Arctic. Franklin wanted to continue with Trent but Buchan overruled him. They reached home on 30 September."]}, {"page": "Royal Hospital School", "response": ["* The Revd George Fisher, FRS, FRAS (1794\u20131873) Astronomer, Arctic explorer.
