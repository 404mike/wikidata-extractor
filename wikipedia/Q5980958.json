On 26 March 1992, he joined Lincoln City on loan for the remainder of the season as cover for Ian Bowling following the departure of Matt Dickins to Blackburn Rovers and was not called upon to make an appearance.", "On 24 September 1992, he rejoined Lincoln City on a month's loan to cover for Ian Bowling who fractured his foot in a 3\u20131 League Cup defeat away to Crystal Palace two days previously. Pollitt made his Football League debut in the 1\u20130 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town on 26 September 1992 and made five league appearances for the club, one of which came against his parent club Bury, before relinquishing his place to the returning Bowling. Pollitt however remained on loan at Sincil Bank and at the end of the second month, Lincoln officially took over the remainder of Pollitt's Bury contract. Following a brief sojourn to appear a further time for Altrincham in the 2\u20130 home victory over Welling United on 19 December 1992, he managed to displace Bowling from the Lincoln side over the Christmas fixtures and a series of impressive displays saw him rewarded with a new two-year contract in March 1993. He began the 1993\u20131994 season as the Imps first-choice goalkeeper before briefly losing his place to John Burridge over the Christmas and New Year fixtures and permanently following the signing of Andy Leaning in March 1994. In the summer, one of the first acts of newly appointed Lincoln manager Sam Ellis was to transfer list Pollitt and Dave Ridings and Pollitt soon agreed a move to Darlington."]}, {"page": "Nathan Jarman", "response": ["Born in Scunthorpe, Jarman came through the youth ranks with Barnsley. He made his debut on 20 November 2004 against Oldham Athletic. In 2006, he played 2 games on loan with Bury, getting sent off on his debut. Jarman went on loan to Conference North side Worksop Town in February 2007. He played 13 times for the Tigers, scoring four goals. While his goal return was not as high as would have been hoped by manager Ian Bowling, some of his goals will live long in the memory of the Worksop fans. He marked his debut with a stunning overhead kick against Barrow and then added a 30-yard volley that crashed in off the post against Redditch. Jarman was eventually released from Oakwell at the end of the 2006\u201307 season."]}, {"page": "Steve Cherry", "response": ["Cherry featured eight times at the start of the 1997\u201398 season before being dropped by manager Brian Talbot. Talbot released him from his contract at Nene Park in September 1997 and set him up for a part-time arrangement at Rothwell Corinthians in the United Counties League Division One. He swiftly joined Northern Premier League Premier Division side Gainsborough Trinity on wages of \u00a3165-a-week, with the promise of a \u00a3500 signing-on fee from manager Steve Richards. He returned to the Conference with Stalybridge Celtic in January 1998, making ten appearances in a brief stay at Bower Fold. He played the opening game of the Third Division 1998\u201399 season for Mansfield Town on 9 August 1998, a 3\u20130 defeat at Brentford, as regular custodian Ian Bowling was unavailable and Steve Parkin needed a goalkeeper for the one match. He later provided cover for Oldham Athletic, with Oldham manager Andy Ritchie providing a \u00a3200 fee to be in the match-day squad against Wycombe Wanderers."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Ian Bowling||||1993, 1993\u20131995||36||0||"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|15||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ian Bowling"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ian Bowling"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ian Bowling"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|1||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ian Bowling"]}, {"page": "Frecheville Community Association F.C.", "response": ["*  Ian Bowling"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ian Bowling"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ian Bowling"]}]}}
