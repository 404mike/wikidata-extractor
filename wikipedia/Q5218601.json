This work, which has profoundly influenced liturgical study in England and which caused his recognition as the leading authority on the subject, was published in 1849 (vols. I and II) and 1853-4 (vol. III). After 1840 Dr. Rock was a prominent member of the Adelphi, an association of London priests who were working together for the restoration of the hierarchy. When this object was achieved, he was elected one of the first canons of Southwark (1852). Shortly after, he ceased parochial work, and having resided successfully at Newick, Surrey (1854\u201364), he went to live near the South Kensington Museum in which he took the keenest interest and to which he proved of much service. His Introduction to the Catalogue of Textile Fabrics in that Museum has been separately reprinted (1876) and is of great authority. He also contributed frequent articles to the Arch\u00e6ological Journal, the Dublin Review, and other periodicals. For many years before his death he held the honourable position of President of the Old Brotherhood of the English Secular Clergy."]}]}}
