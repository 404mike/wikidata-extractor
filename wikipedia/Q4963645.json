Apart from a short spell in the Third Division with Cambridge United he spent his entire career playing non-league football, most notably for Salisbury City where he earned two promotions as club captain.\nAfter retiring as a player he went into coaching at Bristol Rovers, joining up with former Salisbury City manager Darrell Clarke. He originally worked with the U21 squad and focused on player recruitment before being promoted to first team duties in December 2017.\nHe followed Clarke to Walsall in the summer of 2019 as his assistant manager, before taking over as interim head coach himself when Clarke left the club in February 2021. After the season was concluded, Walsall parted ways with Dutton in May 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dutton", "response": ["*Brian Dutton (born 1985), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Malton, North Yorkshire", "response": ["* Brian Dutton \u2013 English professional football coach and former player   "]}, {"page": "List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1974", "response": ["* Brian Dutton, deceased.
