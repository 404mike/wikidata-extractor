One was bassist Rick Kemp, who needed to recover from a serious shoulder injury, exacerbated by playing bass on stage. His eventual replacement (after two tours, each with a different bassist) was Tim Harries, who was brought in less than two weeks before the band was scheduled to start a tour. A friend of Pegrum's, Harries was a self-taught rock bassist, as well as a classically trained pianist and double bassist. With Harries on board, Steeleye released Tempted and Tried (1989), an album that formed the basis for their live set for many years to come.", "For a while the band consisted of just Peter Knight and Tim Harries, plus various guest musicians, as they fulfilled live commitments.  This was an uncertain time for the future of the band, and when Harries announced he was not keen to continue his role, even the willingness of Kemp to return to the line-up full-time was not enough to prevent an 18 month hiatus while Peter Knight and the bands manager, John Dagnell, considered whether it was worth continuing.", "In 1995 Steeleye recorded \"The Golden Vanity\" for the Time album, but it did not appear on it. It was released on the anthology The Best of British Folk Rock. Similarly they recorded \"General Taylor\" for Ten Man Mop but the song did not appear on it. It resurfaced on the compilation album Individually and Collectively instead. It was also included in another compilation The Lark in The Morning (2006), as well as re-issues of Ten Man Mop. \"Bonny Moorhen\" was recorded at the time of the Parcel of Rogues session. It appears, however, on the compilation album Original Masters, and is also packaged as part of A Parcel of Steeleye Span. The song \"Somewhere in London\", recorded for Back in Line (1986) was released instead as a B-side single, but returned to its proper place \"Back in Line\" when the album was reissued in 1991. \"Staring Robin\", a song about a man described by Tim Harries as an \"Elizabethan psycho\", was recorded during the Bedlam Born (2000) sessions, but it was left off the final album as it was deemed by Park Records to be too disturbing.", "* Tim Harries \u2013 bass, piano, guitars, vocals ", "* Tim Harries \u2013 bass, piano, vocals", "* Tim Harries \u2013 bass, piano, vocals", "* Tim Harries \u2013 bass, piano, vocals", "* Tim Harries \u2013 bass, piano, vocals", "* Tim Harries \u2013 bass, piano, vocals", "* Tim Harries \u2013 guitars, piano, vocals", "* Tim Harries \u2013 guitars, piano, vocals", "   bar:Harries      text:\"Tim Harries\""]}, {"page": "Bill Bruford", "response": ["In 1986, Bruford formed his jazz group Earthworks with Django Bates, Iain Ballamy and Mick Hutton (later replaced by Tim Harries), with initial assistance from Dave Stewart.
