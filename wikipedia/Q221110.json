M. Hastings, OBE, is a fictional character created by Agatha Christie as the companion-chronicler and best friend of the Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. He is first introduced in Christie's 1920 novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles (originally written in 1916) and appears as a character in seven other Poirot novels, including the final one Curtain: Poirot's Last Case (1975), along with a play and many short stories.

By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt he was \"an egocentric creep\". Thompson believes Christie's occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that \"in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood.\" Unlike Conan Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.

He first met Poirot in Belgium in 1904, during the Abercrombie Forgery. Later that year they joined forces again to hunt down a criminal known as Baron Altara. They also meet in England where Poirot often helps Japp and lets him take credit in return for special favours.

Compared to Wolfe, Archie is the man of action, tough and street smart. His narrative style is breezy and vivid.

But there is no doubt that Archie was an important addition to the genre of detective fiction.

The story was not rewritten to add more specific markers of the years post Second World War, such as car models, clothing styles, or world events.
