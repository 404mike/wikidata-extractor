Tebbs' batting style is unknown, though it is known he bowled left-arm medium-fast.  He was born at Leeds, Yorkshire.\nWhile studying at the University of Cambridge in 1929, Tebbs made a single first-class appearance for Cambridge University Cricket Club against Glamorgan at Fenner's, Cambridge.  During this match, he was dismissed for a duck in Cambridge University's first-innings by Jack Mercer.  In Glamorgan's first-innings he took the wicket of William Bates, finishing with figures of 1/70.  He wasn't required to bat in the university's second-innings, with the match ending in a draw.  This was his only first-class appearance for the university.\nFollowing World War II, Tebbs made four appearances for Berkshire in the 1946 Minor Counties Championship.  He appeared twice against Suffolk and once against Buckinghamshire and Dorset.  He died at Athens, Greece on 31 January 1973.", "link_mentions": {}}}
