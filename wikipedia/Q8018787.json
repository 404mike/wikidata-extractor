Beare took all his workers with him. The attraction of the location was its proximity to sandy beaches and to a forest of 11,500 hectares of maritime pine trees, which had been planted in the 13th century, initially by King Afonso III and later by his son King Denis. Originally planted to act as a barrier to the invasion of farming areas by coastal sand, the pine trees proved ideal for powering glass factories. Beare experienced financial difficulties and, following the closure of the factory for two years, it was developed by an Englishman, William Stephens.", "Stephens had been born in Exeter, England but made his way to Portugal at an early age, where, in 1746, he was apprenticed to a company in Lisbon operating lime kilns  and, over time, had been very successful in the business. In 1769, fourteen years after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake Portugal was still desperate for glass to assist with rebuilding the country, much of which had been affected by the earthquake. This need for glass was clearly identified by the Marquis of Pombal, prime minister at the time, who played a major role in the reconstruction of Portugal after the earthquake. William Stephens had come to his attention as a competent businessman and Pombal persuaded King D. Jos\u00e9 to grant a Royal Charter to allow Stephens to re-open an existing glass factory, which became known as the Royal Glassworks (). Stephens was also given a large interest-free loan as well as permission to use the pine trees to fire the factory's kilns. He was nevertheless hesitant to take on the task, given his lack of experience with glass making, and is said to have taken two years to make up his mind to accept Pombal's offer.", "Stephens was joined by his younger brother, John James, and by the end of the first year the Stephens brothers were employing 150 men in the glassworks, had manufactured 12,000 sheets of window glass and had sent over a hundred crates of glass to Lisbon. They recruited glass-making experts from both England and Genoa. In 1773, having petitioned the King to provide protection against imports from Bohemia, which, William Stephens argued, were being sold at low prices in order to drive the Marinha Grande factory out of business, they were granted a monopoly of glass supply within Portugal and its colonies. This monopoly and the tax exemptions William Stephens received as an English merchant in Lisbon enabled the brothers to become extremely rich.", "The factory led to the rapid development of Marinha Grande, as many other companies were attracted to the area. It was a pioneer in the provision of social welfare by employers, providing medical care, sick benefits and pensions, as well as a school. The Stephens Brothers established a horticultural farm and a slaughterhouse, the latter to address a shortage of meat caused by the rapid increase in the number of workers at the factory. They followed the agricultural schemes of Thomas Coke of Holkham Hall and transformed agricultural productivity in the area. The factory also had its own theatre, in which the employees performed, on several occasions for visiting royalty. These enlightened ideas for the time were shared by the Marquis of Pombal and William Stephens was a member of a group advising him on social and educational reform."]}, {"page": "British Cemetery, Lisbon", "response": ["*Stephens family graves.
