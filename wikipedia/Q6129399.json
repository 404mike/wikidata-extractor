Barr set several poems by his friend Robert Tannahill to music.\nAccording to Christina Macpherson, \"Waltzing Matilda\" was created in the sitting room of Dagworth Station in January 1895 with the help of a young solicitor and poet, \"Banjo\" Paterson. Tannahill wrote the words in 1805 and in 1818 Barr set them to music, possibly based on the melody of \"Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself.\"Barr emigrated for Canada in 1832, where he worked as a farmer until 1855.

She had emigrated to Australia and lived at Inglewood in Victoria. Her maiden name was Craigie and he composed and dedicated the march \u201cCraigielee\u201d to her as a tribute using the name Godfrey Parker as the composer. Thomas had made a practice of writing and dedicating music to all the female members of the family. In discussion with Adeline Bulch several years after her father's death she mentioned the soldiers returning from France whistling a popular song that she said was set to her father's music. This she identified as \u201cWaltzing Matilda\u201d. She also said that a woman had written to her father requesting permission to use the music, as she wanted to put words to it. Thomas had replied that he no longer had copyright of the music. It is widely thought that Thomas based Craigielee on James Barr's setting of Robert Tannahill's poem \u201cThou Bonnie Wood o' Craigielee\u201d (now commonly spelled as \u201cCraigielea\u201d).
