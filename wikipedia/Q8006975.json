Upon examination, he realized it contained dynamite and a lighted fuse. He rushed up the steps with it into Westminster Hall, intending to deposit the device in New Palace Yard. But before he could reach the door, a hot substance from the bag scalded his hand, causing him to drop it, and as he did so it exploded. He and a colleague, P.C. Cox, were thrown into the large crater torn into the floor of the Hall. Seconds later, another device exploded in the empty chamber of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, causing extensive damage, and a third at the Tower of London. All the bombings were committed by the terrorist group known as the Fenians, the precursors to the Irish Republican Army, nationalists battling British rule in Ireland.\nUnconscious and badly injured, Cole and his colleague were taken to hospital, where they were visited by the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt. Cole's actions had saved the lives of bystanders. Harcourt recognised Cole's gallantry in \"knowing full well the terrible risk he incurred\", and sought the Queen's approval for him to receive the Albert Medal. The award was approved a week later. Cole, who had been promoted to sergeant on 2 February 1885, very soon after the incident, was presented with the medal on 26 March by Harcourt at an impressive gathering in Westminster Hall attended by the Prime Minister, W.E. Gladstone, the Speaker (Arthur Wellesley Peel), and many members of the Lords and Commons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Cole", "response": ["* William Cole (musician) (1909\u20131997), English conductor and organist", "* William Cole (police officer) (c. 1840\u20131900), British policeman", "* William Cole, 1st Earl of Enniskillen (1736\u20131803), Irish peer and politician", "* William Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen (1807\u20131886), known as Viscount Cole", "* William Cole (Australian politician) (1858\u20131938), South Australian House of Assembly", "* William Cole (public servant) (1926\u20132019), Australian", "* William Cole (Dean of Lincoln) (c. 1530\u20131600), English Puritan clergyman", "* William Cole (antiquary) (1714\u20131782), Cambridgeshire clergyman ", "* William Cole (Dean of Waterford) (died 1804)", "* William Cole (botanist) (1626\u20131662), English herbalist", "* William Cole (scholar) (1753\u20131806), English classical scholar"]}, {"page": "William Cole (British constable)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Cole (police officer)"]}, {"page": "List of medals awarded to Metropolitan Police officers", "response": ["*1885 - PC William Cole, A Division, for actions containing a bomb attack on Westminster HallThe story behind the medal in our collection"]}]}}
