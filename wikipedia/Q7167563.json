His 1948 biography The Great Dr Burney was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.\nHe was born in Leeds in 1877 and was educated privately, owing to his poor health as a child. He became an organist, schoolteacher, music journalist,  lecturer, an Inspector of Music in Schools to London University and the Organist and Music Master of Kent College, Canterbury (1900), All Saints, Vevey, Switzerland (1902) as well as Kingswood College, Grahamstown, South Africa (1904).  He was Registrar at the City of Leeds (Municipal) School of Music (1908\u20131912). At various times he was music critic for the Evening Standard, The Observer (1920\u20131927) and the Radio Times (1923\u20131929). He was made an Officer of the Star of Rumania in 1930. He was founder and general secretary of the Anglo-American Conference on Musical Education, Lausanne (1929 and 1931); the president of the Union of Directors of Music in Secondary Schools; founder and editor The Music Student (which later became The Music Teacher); and during the First World War he directed the Music section of the YMCA for troops at home and abroad.

In the Baroque era it became a form of aesthetic expression, increasingly used to adorn religious, social and festive celebrations in which, in accordance with Plato's ideal, the music was subordinated to the text.Carter and Chew (n.d.), \u00a74 \"Theoretical and aesthetic basis of works\" Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, or monody, acquired greater significance towards the end of the 16th century, replacing polyphony as the principal means of dramatic music expression.Cruice (1997), p. 37 This was the changing world in which Monteverdi was active. Percy Scholes in his Oxford Companion to Music describes the \"new music\" thus: \"[Composers] discarded the choral polyphony of the madrigal style as barbaric, and set dialogue or soliloquy for single voices, imitating more or less the inflexions of speech and accompanying the voice by playing mere supporting chords. Short choruses were interspersed, but they too were homophonic rather than polyphonic.\"Ward (ed.)

The following year, the Elgars moved back to London, to a large house in Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, designed by Norman Shaw. There Elgar composed his last two large-scale works of the pre-war era, the choral ode, The Music Makers (for the Birmingham Festival, 1912) and the symphonic study Falstaff (for the Leeds Festival, 1913). Both were received politely but without enthusiasm. Even the dedicatee of Falstaff, the conductor Landon Ronald, confessed privately that he could not \"make head or tail of the piece,\"Kennedy (1971), p. 82 while the musical scholar Percy Scholes wrote of Falstaff that it was a \"great work\" but, \"so far as public appreciation goes, a comparative failure.\"Scholes, Percy A., \"Elgar's 'Falstaff' Reconsidered\", The Musical Times, 1 August 1929, p. 696"]}, {"page": "God Save the Queen", "response": ["In The Oxford Companion to Music, Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody, although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard, and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to \"God Save the King/Queen\". Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull (1619) which has some similarities to the modern tune, depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player (see musica ficta). He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell, one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, setting the words \"God Save the King\".

This may be due to the increased availability of reasonably priced instruments from companies using more automated production techniques, coupled with the greater accessibility of early music editions and historic treatises. The viol is also regarded as a suitable instrument for adult learners; Percy Scholes wrote that the viol repertoire \"belongs to an age that demanded musicianship more often than virtuosity.\" There are now many societies for people with an interest in the viol. The first was the Viola da Gamba Society (Great Britain), which was established in the United Kingdom in 1948 and has a worldwide membership. The Viola da Gamba Society of America followed in 1962, and with over 1000 members in North America and around the world remains the largest organization dedicated to the instrument. Since then, similar societies have been organized in several other nations. In the 1970s, the now-defunct Guitar and Lute Workshop in Honolulu, Hawaii generated resurgent interest in the viol and traditional luthierie methods within the western United States."]}, {"page": "Oxford University Press", "response": ["Foss responded with incredible energy. He worked to establish \"the largest possible list in the shortest possible time\",Oxford p. 6 adding titles at the rate of over 200 a year; eight years later there were 1,750 titles in the catalogue. In the year of the department's establishment, Foss began a series of inexpensive but well edited and printed choral pieces under the series title \"Oxford Choral Songs\". This series, under the general editorship of W. G. Whittaker, was OUP's first commitment to the publishing of music for performance, rather than in book form or for study. The series plan was expanded by adding the similarly inexpensive but high-quality \"Oxford Church Music\" and \"Tudor Church Music\" (taken over from the Carnegie UK Trust); all these series continue today. The scheme of contributed essays Foss had originally brought to Milford appeared in 1927 as the Heritage of Music (two more volumes would appear over the next thirty years). Percy Scholes's Listener's Guide to Music (originally published in 1919) was similarly brought into the new department as the first of a series of books on music appreciation for the listening public. Scholes's continuing work for OUP, designed to match the growth of broadcast and recorded music, plus his other work in journalistic music criticism, would be later comprehensively organized and summarized in the Oxford Companion to Music.

Difference is quantitative and qualitative: how far, and of what type, different. In many cases, form depends on statement and restatement, unity and variety, and contrast and connection."]}, {"page": "List of major opera composers", "response": ["# \"A Bird's Eye View of the World's Chief Opera Composers\" in The Oxford Companion to Music by Percy Scholes (10th edition revised by John Owen Ward, 1970). ."]}, {"page": "1958 in music", "response": ["** Percy Scholes, musicologist, 81"]}, {"page": "1877 in music", "response": ["*July 24 \u2013 Percy Scholes, English musicologist (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "Ferruccio Busoni", "response": ["Sir Henry Wood was surprised to hear Busoni playing, with two hands in double octaves, passages in a Mozart concerto written as single notes.

Scholes had his own copy of the work and used it profitably to discuss in some detail the faults of the work, in particular, the way the serial production caused major problems when editors were faced with new knowledge that appeared after the volume containing the appropriate section had been issued. They addressed this partially with an appendix in the last volume, and also by inventing contorted new subject titles in the main work (\"Cotton Manufacture\", Vol. 10, 1808, and \"Manufacture of Cotton\", Vol. 21, 1812).
