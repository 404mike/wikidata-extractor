I think Bellini comes closest to everything I believe about the greatness of singing.\" Her Adalgisa in a Met Norma (1975) had the misfortune to be paired with an incongruously cast Wagnerian in the opera's title role. Damning the production as \"a travesty of Bellini's work both musically and dramatically\", Donal Henahan of The New York Times wrote that Rita Hunter's \"monumental proportions and virtual immobility as an actress\" were not mitigated by her shrill top notes, her effortful coloratura in \"Casta diva\" and her being apparently often out of breath.

She returned to London in 1959 where she was appointed Professor of Singing at the Royal Academy of Music, a position she held until aged well into her 80s.
