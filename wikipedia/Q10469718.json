Rodman scored again just after the break, cutting in from the left channel and scoring from just outside the area. The home side restored parity for twenty minutes remaining; Mousinho's corner arrived to Luke Foster at the back post, who rifled his shot through a body of players to earn Stevenage a valuable point.
