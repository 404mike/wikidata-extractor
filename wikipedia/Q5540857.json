Hunt originally played football as an amateur for local team Ferndale Athletic, but joined the Army on the outbreak of World War II.\nDuring the war he served in the Middle East and alongside the Desert Rats. It was during a game between armed services in Italy that he was approached by Stan Cullis of Wolverhampton Wanderers, who offered him a trial at the club when the war finished. Hunt declined and returned to Swindon on demob.\nSwindon Town offered him a series of trials with him playing in the outside right position, but an injury during a game led him to dropping back into defence and taking up the Right Back role.\nHe signed for the club as a professional in 1947 and made his first senior appearance against Exeter in September 1948.\nOver his eleven years as a professional player for the club he made 328 appearances in total including 24 Cup appearances.\nHe retired in 1958 and as a qualified coach, assisted the club's back room staff on an intermittent basis whilst returning to work in the GWR Locomotive Works.\nIt was here that he eventually contracted Peritoneal Mesothelioma (also known as \"The Swindon Disease\") caused by exposure to asbestos which led to his death in 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Hunt", "response": ["George Hunt may refer to:", "*George Hunt (American football) (born 1949), American football player", "*George Hunt (footballer, born 1910) (1910\u20131996), English international footballer for Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal", "*George Hunt (footballer, born 1922) (1922\u20131987), English footballer for Swindon Town", "*George Hunt (rower) (1916\u20131999), American rower", "*George Hunt (attorney) (1841\u20131901), American politician", "*George Hunt (ethnologist) (1854\u20131933), Canadian ethnologist", "*George Hunt (merchant) (1845\u20131911), store proprietor in Adelaide, South Australia", "*George Hunt (trombonist) (1906\u20131946), American jazz trombonist", "*George Hunt (British Army officer) (1830\u20131882), credited as the founder of Huntsville, Ontario, Canada", "*George Hunt (Royal Navy officer) (1916\u20132011), highly decorated Second World War submarine commander", "*George Hunt (MP) (died 1798), British politician"]}, {"page": "George Hunt (defender)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Hunt (footballer, born 1922)"]}]}}
