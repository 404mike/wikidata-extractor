Sir John was the last British subject to have his passport personally signed by the monarch. Financial problems, perhaps the result of his passions for horse-racing and cards, led him on a number of occasions to attempt to sell Llanelly House and other parts of his estates. A notorious rake and member of the circle around Charles James Fox, Stepney never married but had a number of affairs, notably with the  society beauty Lady Almeria Carpenter. He had at least three illegitimate sons, one of whom, William Chambers, eventually inherited his estates under the terms of Sir John's remarkably complicated will. He moved abroad in 1802 and died at Trnava, now in Slovakia, on 3 October 1811.  With the death of Sir John's brother, Sir Thomas Stepney (1760\u20131825), a well-known figure in London's clubland and groom of the bed-chamber to the duke of York, the baronetcy became extinct. The last baronet's second wife was the Victorian novelist Catherine, Lady Stepney, who hosted fashionable soirees and patronised the likes of Disraeli and Bulwer-Lytton.Catherine Stepney,  Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, retrieved 5 December 2014"]}, {"page": "Catherine Manners", "response": ["*Catherine Stepney (1778\u20131845), British novelist"]}, {"page": "Stepney (surname)", "response": ["*Catherine Stepney (1778\u20131845), English novelist"]}, {"page": "Catherine Pollok", "response": ["#REDIRECT Catherine Stepney"]}]}}
