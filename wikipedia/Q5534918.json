Coldcut incorporated several new elements in producing their remix, including the addition of various vocal samples. The most prominent of these samples was the voice of Israeli singer Ofra Haza, taken from her recording of \"Im Nin'alu\". Jonathan More of Coldcut had previously played the Haza record in clubs and found that when he lowered its pitch, it synced perfectly with the \"Ashley's Roachclip\" drum sample. The success of the remix helped thrust Haza into the public eye. \"Im Nin'alu\" was remixed and released as a single in its own right, and sales of Haza's 1984 album Yemenite Songs increased dramatically. Haza only took issue to the fact that she was not informed of the sample. Another notable element of the Coldcut remix is its opening vocal sample, \"This is a journey into sound!\" \u2013 the voice of British actor Geoffrey Sumner. \"Now wait a minute, you better talk to my mother\" comes from Humphrey Bogart and the 1946 classic film The Big Sleep.  The lines \"Pump up the volume\" and \"Def with the record\" are sampled from Eric B. & Rakim's own song \"I Know You Got Soul\", also from Paid in Full. Other sample sources present in the remix include an anonymous James Brown, Don Pardo, the Peech Boys and the Salsoul Orchestra. \"Paid In Full\" is believed to be the first hip hop record to implement layers of singing vocal samples over a drumbeat."]}, {"page": "Side by Side (1975 film)", "response": ["*Geoffrey Sumner \u2013 Magistrate"]}, {"page": "Top Secret (1952 film)", "response": ["* Geoffrey Sumner - Pike"]}, {"page": "Those People Next Door", "response": ["* Geoffrey Sumner ...
