These include the testing of a lunar landing device by personnel from the White Sands Missile Range and a prank perpetrated by students from the nearby New Mexico Tech. Regarding the latter explanation, then-president of New Mexico Tech Stirling Colgate supported the idea that students from the school were responsible for the hoax, and additionally wrote that the object observed by Zamora was \"A candle in a balloon. Not sophisticated.\" UFO skeptic Steuart Campbell has suggested that what Zamora observed was \"almost certainly\" a mirage of the star Canopus.Campbell, Steuart. (1994). The UFO Mystery Solved.

In support of his hypothesis, Campbell reported that a blue and reddened Sun was reported in China as documented in 1983.\"F\u00e1tima's dusty veil\", New Humanist, Vol 104, No 2, August 1989 and \"The Miracle of the Sun at F\u00e1tima\", Journal of Meteorology, UK, Vol 14, no. 142, October 1989 Paul Simons, in an article entitled \"Weather Secrets of Miracle at F\u00e1tima\", stated that it is possible that some of the optical effects at F\u00e1tima may have been caused by a cloud of dust  from the Sahara.\"Weather Secrets of Miracle at F\u00e1tima\", Paul Simons, The Times, 17 February 2005."]}]}}
