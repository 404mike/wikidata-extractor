He came over and said it was very interesting. 'I am a producer of a programme called Late Night Line-Up. Would you like to come along and do something similar on the programme?' They liked it and asked me to come back next week and do another one. I initially signed a contract for six months, which grew and grew. I ended up staying with Late Night Line Up for five years. The talk and emphasis was always about old movies. Film Night came out of Late Night Line Up. It started with me and Tony Bilbow. Tony reviewed the new films whilst I related the new films to ones that were made earlier, linking them with either a director or a star or the style; something they had in common.\" He was later asked by Late Night Live producer Rowan Ayers to help him launch The Beatles Abbey Road album."]}, {"page": "1932 in British television", "response": ["* 17 April \u2013 Tony Bilbow, presenter and screenwriter"]}, {"page": "Set of Six (TV series)", "response": ["Set of Six was a British sketch comedy show, broadcast in 1990, starring Rowland Rivron as the Scrote sextuplets.
