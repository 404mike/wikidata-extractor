The home side took the lead seven minutes before half-time, with Chris Beardsley swivelling in the area before scooping the ball into the far corner of the goal, although the striker was subsequently substituted immediately after as a result of picking up a hamstring injury in the build-up to the goal. Substitute Ben May was sent-off for the home side after \"squaring up\" to Tranmere goalkeeper Paul Rachubka with twenty minutes remaining. Despite the visitors having a one-man advantage, it was Stevenage who doubled the lead, Mark Roberts heading in Robin Shroot's cross to score his fifth goal of the campaign. Tranmere's Joss Labadie scored a consolation goal for the away side in the third minute of injury-time, scoring from the penalty spot after Scott Laird was adjudged to have brought down Mark McChrystal. Nine days later, Stevenage faced a Boxing Day away trip to Colchester United. Stevenage won the game 6\u20131, their biggest Football League victory to date. The visitors scored the opening goal within the first ten minutes, Don Cowan and Chris Beardsley linked up well before the latter provided a square pass to the onrushing Robin Shroot, who made no mistake from six yards out. Cowan then set-up Beardsley, who scored from 25-yards with a low drilled effort. After hitting the post and forcing Chris Day into making a number of saves, Colchester halved the deficit shortly after the interval when Karl Duguid's cross looped across the face of the goal and Ian Henderson's headed in from six yards. Stevenage restored their two-goal cushion ten minutes later, when Michael Bostwick picked up Phil Edwards' pass and saw his 30-yard shot take a deflection and wrong-foot Ben Williams in the Colchester goal. Seven minutes later, Stevenage scored their fourth goal from a well-worked free-kick \u2014 with Bostwick playing the ball to Scott Laird, who sidefooted the ball into the net from inside the area. Another goal followed just two minutes later, when Luke Freeman picked up Joel Byrom's pass, beat his man and lashed the ball across the goal with a \"powerful strike\". Byrom added a sixth goal with ten minutes remaining when he ran onto Ronnie Henry's header and calmly scored from just inside the area. Five days later, on 31 December, Stevenage won their third consecutive game when they beat Wycombe Wanderers 1\u20130 at Adams Park. The only goal of the game came with just eight minutes remaining, substitute Luke Freeman's left wing cross found Lawrie Wilson, who lashed the ball into the net with a first time finish from six yards out."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|30 June 2011|| Mark McChrystal||||1 July 2013", "| 6 |||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mark McChrystal"]}, {"page": "Max Power (footballer)", "response": ["On 7 October 2014, Power opened the scoring as Tranmere drew 1\u20131 at home against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy second round, advancing via a penalty shootout.
