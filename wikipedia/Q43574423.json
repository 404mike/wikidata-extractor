E. Wortham was an English biographer, journalist, music critic and writer.\nWortham was educated at King's College, Cambridge and received an MA in 1921. He worked as a foreign correspondent, editor and journalist in Egypt, 1909\u20131919. From 1934 up until his death he wrote articles in the 'London Day by Day' column under the pseudonym 'Peterborough' in The Daily Telegraph.Wortham was the nephew of Oscar Browning. In June 1923 Browning sent a letter to Wortham requesting him to write a biography about his life. In 1927, he authored a biography of Browning. It was reprinted and revised in 1956 under the title Victorian Eton and Cambridge: Being the Life and Times of Oscar Browning.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mary Baker Eddy", "response": ["After she became well known, reports surfaced that Eddy was a medium in Boston at one time.Peel 1966, p. 133. At the time when she was said to be a medium there, she lived some distance away.Gill, 1998, p. 627. According to Gill, Eddy knew spiritualists and took part in some of their activities, but was never a convinced believer.Gill, 1998, pp. 179\u2013180. For example, she visited her friend Sarah Crosby in 1864, who believed in Spiritualism. According to Sibyl Wilbur, Eddy attempted to show Crosby the folly of it by pretending to channel Eddy's dead brother Albert and writing letters which she attributed to him.Sibyl Wilbur, \"The Story of the Real Mrs. Eddy,\" Human Life, March 1907, 10. In regard to the deception, biographer Hugh Evelyn Wortham commented that \"Mrs. Eddy's followers explain it all as a pleasantry on her part to cure Mrs. Crosby of her credulous belief in spiritualism.\"Wortham,  p. 220. However, Martin Gardner has argued against this, stating that Eddy was working as a spiritualist medium and was convinced by the messages. According to Gardner, Eddy's mediumship converted Crosby to Spiritualism.Gardner 1993, 26.", "* Hugh Evelyn Wortham. Three Women: St. Teresa, Madame de Choiseul, M\u1e5b\u1e63 Eddy.
