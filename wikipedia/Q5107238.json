On a lively Headingley pitch, his style took wickets and proved hard to score against.

He did play in four of the five ODIs on that tour, bowling particularly creditably in the 2nd in Kingston, Jamaica, with four wickets on his comeback after missing the 1st Test: but a loss of form in the later ODIs and a subsequent recurrence of his back problem cut his tour short, the only time injury got the better of him in his career.

Graham Gooch, although nearly 40, was captain, opening batsman, and in the form of his life: having only the previous year scored 333 against India. His long search for a reliable opening partner seemed to have been ended by the emergence of Michael Atherton, who had made the position his own over the previous year with centuries against New Zealand, India and Australia. In the middle order, Allan Lamb was still highly regarded as a fine player of fast bowling, and his record against the West Indies ensured him a place in the team at the start of the summer: while Robin Smith, the only one of many debutants in the disastrous 1988 series to emerge with credit, was utterly fearless against fast bowling, and already recognised as world-class.  Sadly, internal squabbles - and a belief that, despite having a better average than many of his competitors, he was still definitely aging (although younger than Gooch) - kept David Gower out of the side: but at the younger end of the scale, two highly regarded newcomers were coming through. Graeme Hick, Zimbabwean-born and having gone through a long residency qualification, had not only been breaking records all over the place in county cricket, but had thumped a magnificent 172* off the full West Indian attack for Worcestershire the only time he had faced them in 1988, was now qualified for England, and was rushed into the side: and not far behind his county record, came Mark Ramprakash of Middlesex.  In the one-day matches they would be joined by Neil Fairbrother, regarded as a brilliant specialist in the shorter format but not quite technically sound enough for Tests. Jack Russell, equally eccentric in manners and mannerisms both on and off the pitch, was widely thought of as one of the best wicket-keepers in the world, as well as being a more than handy nuisance with the bat: an alternative wicketkeeper was Alec Stewart, not as fine a keeper but a good enough batsman to be selected for that alone. For bowling, the picture was considerably less clear: especially because Angus Fraser, far and away England's best bowler of the past two years, had broken down injured on the winter tour of Australia, and would miss the series (and indeed the next two years).  Devon Malcolm, as fast a bowler as any of the West Indians but not always reliably accurate - perhaps best compared to Patterson - had mostly cemented a place in the team, although he was being pushed hard for it by the bulky David Lawrence of Gloucestershire - both being regarded as sufficiently risky that there was not room for both in the team.  England, unlike West Indies, would at least consider selecting a specialist spin bowler, and the choice was between two slow left-armers: Phil Tufnell who had bowled well in his debut series but had severe off-pitch disciplinary issues, and moreover was a hopeless batsman and fielder, or Richard Illingworth, who spun the ball less but was more accurate on the pitch and reliable off it, and moreover was a fine enough lower-order batsman to have scored first-class centuries.  The lively fast-medium swing of Phil DeFreitas had made him a first choice pick in English conditions: Chris Lewis was of similar repute, but untried, as a bowler with pretensions to batting, while the military-medium of Derek Pringle had slowed down recently but become more accurate, and Steve Watkin of Glamorgan had been taking wickets by the hatful in county cricket. The trouble was, as usual, deciding which of them deserved a place above the others, all being good but few having made a truly compelling claim to a permanent position. And waiting in the wings was that old warhorse of an all-rounder Ian Botham, now portly, aging and far slower than he had been, out of the team for two years, but still wanting one last crack at the only team he had never really done himself justice against.", "If the Third Test had seen England crash from a promising start, the Fourth saw an awful start, a couple of attempts to retrieve the situation, only to crash again. Smith, who had been batting at six, had sustained an injury in between the Third and Fourth tests: England's response was to drop Atherton down a place in the order - he had looked uncharacteristically fragile this series - also moving Hick, Lamb and Ramprakash down a place, and bring in Glamorgan's opener Hugh Morris for a Test debut (had Smith been fit, Morris would still have played, Lamb would have been dropped instead.) Lawrence was dropped to 12th man to make a place for Chris Lewis, another tall fast bowler with pretensions to all-rounder status. For West Indies, they were able to reverse the change they had been forced into at Lords, Patterson being fit again, and returning to replace Allen. England crashed to 188 all out: only Gooch (45) and Ramprakash (29, his own highest score) passing 20. West Indies, in return, passed England's score with only three wickets down, and reached 253/4 by the end of the second day, the pick of the batsmen being Richardson with a fine century. Even more worryingly, DeFreitas - pick of England's bowlers so far in the series - sustained an injury halfway through an over, was unable to complete it, and limped off.", "Chris Lewis tried to inspire a fightback: both overnight batsmen fell quickly to his bowling the next morning, as did the rest of the West Indies, Lewis finishing with six wickets, West Indies on 292. But England, in turn, were wrecked by the returning Patterson, bowling as fast as he had ever bowled, and for once adding gun-barrel accuracy to his pace. England were smashed to 5/3, then 94/5 (Gooch out for 40) and finally 145/8. For a second time Lewis, coming in at number 10, attempted a one-man fightback, smashing his way to 65: and again, as he had done so often this series, Pringle was able to hold out obdurately at the other end when he had someone to support, and made 45. These last two plus Illingworth between them added over a hundred to the score, turning a walkover target into a potentially tricky 152 on a pitch which was becoming itself increasingly tricky: then DeFreitas, bowling despite his injury, blew away three West Indians for 24 runs, and it was game on. Sadly he could not bowl at both ends, nor for long as the earlier injury continued to bother him: Pringle's earlier accuracy in the series deserted him, Lewis was unable to replicate his own first-innings heroics, and Illingworth's consistency also left him, Hooper and Richards finishing the job without further loss. Richards rubbed salt into the wound, finishing the match by belting Illingworth for six when only one run was needed, while Richardson's first innings century gave him the match award."]}, {"page": "Pakistani cricket team in England in 1992", "response": ["|| Chris Lewis || RHB, RFM"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in the West Indies in 1993\u201394", "response": ["The England team were captained by Mike Atherton in his first tour as captain, and they were looking to put their recent poor results behind them, and follow up on the Sixth Test victory over Australia.
