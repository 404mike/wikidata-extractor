To orthodox thinkers, Epicureanism was still regarded as immoral and heretical. For instance, Lucy Hutchinson (1620\u20131681), the first translator of Lucretius's On the Nature of Things into English, railed against Epicurus as \"a lunatic dog\" who formulated \"ridiculous, impious, execrable doctrines\"."]}, {"page": "17th century in literature", "response": ["* 1620 \u2013 Lucy Hutchinson"]}, {"page": "1664 in literature", "response": ["*Lucy Hutchinson \u2013 Memoirs Of The Life Of Colonel Hutchinson"]}, {"page": "1620 in literature", "response": ["*January 29 \u2013 Lucy Hutchinson, English biographer and translator (died 1681)"]}, {"page": "De rerum natura", "response": ["The first printed edition of De rerum natura was produced in Brescia, Lombardy, in 1473.
