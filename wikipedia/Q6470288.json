He was paralysed from the waist down and has used a wheelchair for mobility ever since.

Improvisers Bailey and Coxhill became \"enthusiastic supporters\" of Henry Cow and attended many of their concerts; Frith later stated that he was \"strongly affected by their critical engagement and encouragement\". For the first time the band started getting some attention from the national music press. Reviewing the first Cabaret Voltaire event with Kevin Ayers in October 1972 in New Musical Express, Ian MacDonald described Henry Cow as \"one of the most resilient and obstinate of that range of groups normally ignored by the popular music press\".
