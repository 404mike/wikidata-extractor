In Morton's time, this wasting disease was termed consumption, or by its Greek name of phthisis.  Recognition of the many possible symptoms of this infection belonging to a single disease was not until the 1820s and it was J.L. Sch\u00f6nlein in 1839 who introduced the term \"tuberculosis\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
