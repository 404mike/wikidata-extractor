It was described by The Guardian as \"an extraordinary, hydra-headed beast, combining music, dance, poetry, mime, burlesque, magic and theatre\". The show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Bush was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design, costume design and hiring. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her need to dance as she sang, sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion a headset microphone; it was the first used by a rock performer since the Spotnicks used a rudimentary version in the early 1960s."]}, {"page": "Raising Hell (video)", "response": ["The concert was the last to feature vocalist Bruce Dickinson until his return to the band in 1999.
