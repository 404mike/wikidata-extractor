Justice Grantham was himself a former Conservative MP, and this was the third petition hearing at that year in which he had been seen to express political partisanship, having previously heard petitions relating to the 1906 election in Bodmin and Maidstone. After an outburst in court in Liverpool, where he claimed the right to hold and express his political opinions, a motion was tabled in the House of Commons on the Great Yarmouth petition, which sought to begin the a formal process of examining \"complaints that have been made of the partisan and political character of the conduct during the trial of that petition of Mr. Justice Grantham.\" The motion, which had been signed by 347 MPs, was moved by South Donegal MP J. G. Swift MacNeill, who attacked Grantham to repeated cheers in the House. Baker, he pointed out, was a boatman whose wife was being sued for non-payment of her milk bill; and Grantham had described Colomb as \"my fear friend\". In a lengthy debate, the Attorney-General Sir John Walton described Grantham's conduct as \"most unfortunate\", but warned the House that proceeding to ask the Crown to remove a judge was an extreme step, and one he advised against. MacNeill withdrew the motion."]}, {"page": "1904 City of London by-election", "response": ["The writ for the City of London was opposed by the South Donegal MP J. G.
