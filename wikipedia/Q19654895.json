In this remote district, on the Atlantic coast, he designed and built and under his own personal supervision, a cruciform church on the model of the ancient cathedral of Iona, the labour being supplied by tin miners and people of the neighbourhood, chiefly in their leisure hours. He was \"anchored\" here and never held any other preferment.  Aitken was visited at Pendeen by the young William Booth (founder of the Salvation Army) and William Haslam. Haslam later recognised his debt to Aitken in the book From Death Unto Life.

It is home to the last remaining Grey Box gum trees (Eucalyptus microcarpa) on the Adelaide plains, some of which pre-date European settlement. The park takes its name from the place of birth of William Haslam, the property's last private owner; Heywood in Lancashire, England. The City of Unley council purchased the property and it was officially opened to the public on 10 December 1921. Today, the park is popular with families and children, in part due its \"huge, magnificent, thick-trunked trees.\" As of 2014, a number of these have been marked for removal following concerns about falling branches and public safety. Some community members have raised concerns about the tree removals' impact on the park's amenity, wildlife habitat value and cultural significance to the Kaurna people of the Adelaide plains.", "In 1913, the estate known simply as Heywood was owned and managed by Annie Haslam, widow to William Haslam, who died in 1898. It was regarded as \"practically the only park left in the vicinity\" and an account of a council inspection of the property's grounds stated:\"There has been some talk of cutting up the property into building lots, and if this is done Unley's last chance of owning a really fine public park will have been lost.\"After council acquired the land, 'sanitary conveniences' were constructed and an opening ceremony was planned for 10 December 1921. Community members held fundraisers to support the works and the hosting of a fair to be held in the park on the day of its opening. That year, the Unley Council resolved that Heywood Park should be \"...preserved in its natural state as a public park.\""]}, {"page": "List of South Australian Legislative Council by-elections", "response": ["|William Haslam"]}, {"page": "Haslam, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Haslam"]}, {"page": "North-Eastern District (South Australian Legislative Council)", "response": ["|rowspan=4| William Haslam (re-elected 1897)"]}]}}
