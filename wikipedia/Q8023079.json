He initially wrote poetry, but subsequently became a novelist and essayist. His writing style is often said to be abstract and densely metaphorical, and his subject matter wide-ranging. Harris is considered one of the most original and innovative voices in postwar literature in English.", "Wilson Harris was born in New Amsterdam in British Guiana, where his father worked at an insurance company. ", "His parents were Theodore Wilson Harris and Millicent Josephine Glasford Harris. After studying at Queen's College in the capital of Guyana, Georgetown, he became a government surveyor, before taking up a career as lecturer and writer. The knowledge of the savannas and rain forests he gained during his twenty years as a land surveyor formed the setting for many of his books, with the Guyanese landscape dominating his fiction. The experience of the Guyanese interior also shaped his approach to fiction. He writes: \"The impact of the forests and savannahs on those expeditions was to become of profound value in the language of the fictions I later wrote. My stepfather's disappearance in that immense interior when I was a child was the beginning of an involvement with the enigma of quests and journeys through visible into invisible worlds that become themselves slowly visible to require to require further penetration into other visible worlds without end or finality\" (\u201cAn Autobiographical Essay,\u201d in Adler 2003: ix\u2013x).", "Harris was created a Knight Bachelor in June 2010, in the Queen Elizabeth II Birthday Honours.\"Wilson Harris Knighted\", Stabroek News, 14 June 2010. In 2014, Harris won a Lifetime Achievement Prize from the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.", "Critics have described Harris's abstract, experimental narratives as difficult to read, dense, complex, or opaque.Criticism for Harris Wilson. Many readers have commented that Harris's essays push the boundaries of traditional literary criticism, and that his fiction pushes the limits of the novel genre itself. Harris's writing has been associated with many different literary genres by critics, including: surrealism, magic realism, mysticism and modernism.  Over the years, Harris has used many different concepts to define his literary approach, including: cross-culturalism, modern allegory,Stephen Slemon,\"Interview with Wilson Harris\", Ariel 19, no. 3 (July 1988): pp. 47\u201356. epic, and quantum fiction. One critic described Harris's fictions as informed by \"quantum penetration where Existence and non-existence are both real. You can contemplate them as if both are true.\"", "In his introduction to Tradition, the Writer, and Society (1967), C. L. R. James writes of a dialectical impulse at work in Harris' fiction and theory, linking Harris to Hegel and Heidegger. However, later critical work such as by Hena Maes-Jelinek, Paget Henry and Andrew Bundy argued that Harris was instead drawing on aesthetic resources of syncretism of African and Amerindigenous systems of belief and practice. Harris himself wrote in History, Fable & Myth in the Caribbean & Guianas (1970) that his work \"reads back through the shock of place and time for omens of capacity that were latent, unrealized, within the clash of cultures and movements of peoples into the South Americas and West Indies\u201d. Harris does not necessarily need to rely on a Hegelian historical theory, since he feels that a philosophy of history in fact lies within Caribbean arts (ibid). As much as James' materialist historical approach is an indelible influence on the Caribbean, modern criticism on Harris argues that the importance of the materialist approach cannot overshadow other Caribbean philosophies of history, such as presented by Harris. Paget Henry places Wilson Harris in the \"mythopoetic tradition\" of Caribbean thought in his foundational Caliban's reason (2000).", "The technique of Harris has been called experimental and innovative. Harris describes that conventional writing is different from his style of writing in that \"conventional writing is straightforward writing\" and \"My writing is quantum writing. Do you know of the quantum bullet? The quantum bullet, when it's fired, leaves not one hole but two.\"Sateesh Maharaj, \"Sir Wilson Harris\", Trinidad Express Newspapers, 3 July 2010.", "Harris sees language as the key to social and human transformations. His approach begins with a regard of language as a power to both enslave and free. This quest and understanding underlies his narrative fiction themes about human slavery. Harris cites language as both, a crucial element in the subjugation of slaves and indentures, and the means by which the destructive processes of history could be reversed.David P. Lichtenstein, Wilson Harris \u2013 Experimental Vision \u2013 Part One: The Technique of Combination; Brown University, 1999.", "In Palace of the Peacock, Harris seeks to expose the illusion of opposites that create enmities between people. A crew on a river expedition experiences a series of tragedies that ultimately bring about each member's death. Along the way, Harris highlights as prime factor in their demise their inability to reconcile binarisms in the world around them and between each other. With his technique of binary breakdowns, and echoing the African tradition of death not bringing the end to a soul, Harris demonstrates that they find reconciliation only in physical death, pointing out the superficiality of illusions of opposites that separated them.David P. Lichtenstein, Wilson Harris \u2013 Experimental Vision \u2013 Part Two: Combination and Humanity; Brown University, 1999.", "Harris noted in an interview that \"in describing the world you see, the language evolves and begins to encompass realities that are not visible\".Monica Pozzi, \"A Conversation with Wilson Harris\" Hollands, 10 September 1997; Journal of Caribbean Literature, 2.1 \u2013 3 (Spring 2000). Harris attributed his innovative literary techniques as a development that was the result of being witness to the physical world behaving as quantum theory. To accommodate his new perceptions, Harris said he realized he was writing \"quantum fiction\".Jefferson-Miles (2002), p. 180. The 'quantum' component of his work is his attempt to measure up to the demand of reality itself, deeply influenced by his two decades as a land surveyor of the Guyanese interior. Of the connection between nature and his literary style, Harris wrote:", "His writing has been called ambitiously experimental and his narrative structure is described as \"multiple and flexible\".Andrew Jefferson-Miles, \"Quantum Value in Harris's 'architecture of the tides'\", in Hena Maes-Jelinek & B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Ledent (eds), Theatre of the Arts: Wilson Harris and the Caribbean, Amsterdam \u2013 New York: Editions Rodopi, 2002, p. 178; . Common metafiction framing techniques in his novels include dreams and dreams within dreams (as in the Guyana Quartet (1985) and The Dark Jester (2001)), tropes from epic poetry, found or received archival material (such as the asylum journals analysed by the narrator in The Waiting Room (1966) or The Angel at the Gate(1982), or the papers of Idiot Nameless in Companions of the Day and Night (1975)), and the repeated use of the same characters across different novel-universes (such as the da Silva twins from Palace, who reappear throughout the oeuvre, for example in Da Silva Da Silva's Cultivated Wilderness (1977)).", "Harris categorized his innovations and literary techniques as quantum fiction.Jefferson-Miles (2002), p. 181.Fred D'Aguiar, \"Wilson Harris\" (interview), BOMB 82 magazine, Winter 2003. In a July 2010 interview with Michael Gilkes, he said: \"I came to the idea of a quantum reality through the kind of landscape I was dealing with. You had trees, rivers, cliffs, human beings, waterfalls and you had various opposites in them. There were opposites in the land, in the rivers, in the waterfalls, and in order to write about this I had to find a method which I later discovered was a quantum reality. At the time when I wrote Palace I knew nothing of quantum physics. Later on I used the idea consciously, since I had already opened myself to it.

On account both of her Jewish provenance and of her record of left-wing political activism, Kolmer could not expect an easy life in a state controlled by the Nazis.  The Pearson foundation which had sponsored her research earlier in the decade was based in England, and her own travels had enabled her to establish further contacts in London.  By now she had also mastered the English language.  Following the advice of party comrades she emigrated, leaving Vienna on 16 March 1938 with a train ticket that took her to Z\u00fcrich, from where she went on via Paris (where she encountered \"passport problems\"), arriving in London on 24 March 1938.  She arrived, one of the first of a wave of political exiles from Austria, with a British pound in her handbag and, as she later wrote, no idea that she was not to set foot in her native land for another seven years.  An \"invitation letter\" from an English friend had persuaded the authorities to let her into the country, and supported a three-month visitor's permit, but she had no long term visa and no permission to obtain work.  The invitation letter had been provided by Wilson Harris, a prominent journalist and the editor of The Spectator whom she had met the previous year while visiting London on a journalistic assignment of her own, on behalf of the \"Wiener Wirtschaftswoche\".  The Spectator's traditionalist conservatism reflected its editor's background, and it is hard to have seen that there can have been much meeting of minds between Kolmer and Harris on political matters.  Harris was, as it turned out, one of several contacts in the English establishment whom she had been able to cultivate during her visits to London during the 1930s.  Others included the Liberal politician, Geoffrey Mander who, like Wilson, took a particular interest in Austria, along with the formidable feminist campaigner Margery Corbett Ashby and the Duchess of Atholl, whom Kolmer later described as \"highly prominent but completely mad\".", "In due course the administrative issues began to be resolved and she obtained laboratory work with her former sponsors at the Pearson Organisation.  Fairly soon she was dropped by Pearson \"on political grounds\", however.  She was able to stay with Margery Corbett Ashby for her first month in England.  During this time she found time to produce a short report, describing the dramatic events of March 1938 in Austria.  Wilson Harris provided an introduction to the London publisher, Michael Joseph:  she published her account under the title \"Austria Still Lives\" in  London in May 1938 under the pseudonym \"Mitzi Hartmann\".  The fifty pounds she received for the little book enabled her to repay a debt and live on the balance for a short time.  She also found casual secretarial and journalistic work.  She was particularly appreciative of the learning opportunities provided by a stint working at \"The Peckham Pioneer Healther Centre\"."]}]}}
