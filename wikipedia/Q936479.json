In the early 2000s, he independently released a series of highly influential eskibeat instrumentals on white label vinyl, such as the first in the series \"Eskimo\" and is known as a grime MC both for his solo work and for material released with his crew Roll Deep.\nWiley first tasted success as a member of UK garage crew Pay As U Go, with whom he had a top 40 hit, \"Champagne Dance\" in 2001. Wiley has continued to make grime music while also releasing mainstream singles, such as the UK Singles Chart top 10 hits \"Wearing My Rolex\", \"Never Be Your Woman\", and his UK number-one \"Heatwave\". Wiley's eleventh album, Godfather (2017), peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, becoming his highest-charting album of his career, and also won an \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" award by NME.\nRegarded as a pioneer in the British underground music scene with a prolific work rate and a versatile music artist with many crossover hits, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music Wiley has been stabbed on several occasions.

Rascal's DJ, DJ Semtex, said in 2004, \"the biggest conflict I have is with major labels because they still don't get it\". Andy Bennett and Jon Stratton highlight in the book Britpop and the English Music Tradition (2010) how Rascal alongside Sway and M.I.A. created music that explored new soundscapes with new technologies, with lyrics expressing anger at Britain's \"racialized\" subordination of minority groups and that the innovation that generates new musical forms like grime and dubstep that are, inevitably, politically engaged.

In the mid-2010s, grime began to receive popular attention in Canada. The genre has been described as the \"most significant musical development within the UK for decades.\"", "The first grime track is often debated. Some will credit Pay As U Go's \"Know We\" or So Solid Crew's \"Dilemma\" (both were released in 2000), however, \"Eskimo\" by Wiley (produced in Christmas 1999, but released in 2002) and \"Pulse X\" by Youngstar (released in 2002), a member of Musical Mobb, are also often considered to be contenders. Dizzee Rascal personally claimed his song \"Crime\", released in 2000, was the first grime song. DJ Slimzee and DJ Karnage have also suggested \"Year 2000\" (released 2000) by Wiley as a contender. Other tracks that were among the first to be labelled as \"grime\" include \"Ice Rink\" and \"Igloo\" by Wiley, \"Creeper\" by Danny Weed, and \"Dollar Sign\" by Sticky featuring Stush.", "Wiley at the timed dubbed the sound 'eskibeat' rather than \"grime\", which had yet to gain popular usage. His song \"Eskimo\" was characterised by its sparse and cold production, and \"awkward, off-kilter rhythms\". Wiley explained this colder, darker sound, reflected his mental state at the time, stating \"The music reflects what\u2019s going on in society. Everyone\u2019s so angry at the world and each other. And they don\u2019t know why\" to Spin magazine in 2005. The name \"grime\" was coined by journalists who initially termed the music's sub-bass heavy sound as \"grimy\", which subsequently became \"grime\". It has also been suggested by artists themselves that the term fits as the music frequently talks about \"grimy goings-on\" in deprived areas. Initially, some referred to the genre as 'grimey garage'.", "At this point, the style was known by a number of names, including 8-bar (meaning eight-bar verse patterns), nu shape (which encouraged more complex 16-bar and 32-bar verse patterns), sublow (a music style and movement created by Jon E Cash with Dread D (T Williams) and crew \"The Black Ops\", the name sublow being a reference to the very low bassline frequencies, often around 40 Hz) and eskibeat, a term applied specifically to a style initially developed by Wiley and his collaborators, incorporating dance and electro elements. This indicated the movement of UK garage away from its house influences towards darker themes and sounds. Wiley's song \"Wot Do U Call It\" was released in 2004 and was made to address the identity problems grime was experiencing at the time, and to establish its separation from garage. It became Wiley's first grime hit song.", "Grime is not an offshoot of early electronic music, but rather a subgenre that draws from a wide variety of influences. Early innovative artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Wiley were able to take the strong thumping drums of drum and bass, lyricism and vocal styles of UK garage and alter some of the rhythms of dancehall to capture all three genre's essences and add a new half-time, down-tempo dimension to the mix. The genre's popularity grew exponentially in the United Kingdom, as people across the scene's musical spectrum appreciated grime's eclectic mix of instrumentation and subcultures. This hybridisation united many different music scenes, allowing for it to spread in the same word-of-mouth and mixtape-based style as hip-hop, yet still appeal to fans of electronic music. It also paved the way for more electronic music artists to incorporate stronger Jamaican influence in the future. Grime never received the same attention worldwide that it did in the UK. Much like many other less mainstream forms of British electronic music, its main scene and fan base remained in the United Kingdom.", "Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Kano and Lethal Bizzle were among the first to bring the genre to mainstream media attention in 2003\u20132004, with their albums Boy in da Corner, Treddin' on Thin Ice, Home Sweet Home and Against All Oddz respectively. Dizzee Rascal garnered widespread critical acclaim and commercial success with Boy in da Corner winning the 2003 Mercury Music Prize. From 2001-2006 The RWD magazine forum was cited as a key development in the genre's culture. Moderators included Logan Sama, and artists such as Wiley, Skepta and Jme would often come on the forum to engage with the community. This was the birthplace of Wiley's famous rants, where he would often target forum users and resort to either trolling or humorous insults.", "By the late 2000s, grime had begun to enter into a decline. Record labels, radio, and the media struggled with knowing what to do with grime, and as a result limited its impact and exposure. The rise of dubstep and UK funky also made it harder for grime to gain a limelight. Many grime MCs also began to move towards commercial electro house-influenced rap and away from grime music. Artists such as Tinchy Stryder, Chip, and Wiley began to shift away from grime music and instead began releasing music with pop elements to much success. Wiley's track \"Wearing My Rolex\", produced by Bless Beats, has been credited for kickstarting this wave of commercialisation, but while it managed to gain a number 2 spot in the official singles chart, many of the initial attempts to replicate this success failed. Tinchy Stryder's \"Stryderman\" only managed to peak of No. 73, while Roll Deep's \"Do Me Wrong\" failed to chart at all. Skepta's \"Rolex Sweep\" only peaked at number 86, although it did briefly start a dance craze after it was released, received a remix by the band Coldplay, and featured on the comedy show Misfits. Dizzee Rascal found more success than most, with his songs such as \"Dance wiv Me\" finding itself on the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. The wave of commercialised music received some criticism from fellow grime artists for being inauthentic to the original sound.", "In 2011, a new edition of Lord of the Mics was released, the first since 2006. Lord of the Mics is a series of grime clashes hosted by Jammer. Both the LOTM III DVD and CD charted. Wiley, inspired by the return of LOTM, also brought back Eskimo Dance the following year, a grime rave from the 2000s that had been discontinued. Jammer suggested that the success of Eskimo Dance encouraged more grime raves to be held than had been previously.", "In May 2016, Skepta's fourth studio album, Konnichiwa, entered the UK Albums Chart at number two. The album was awarded the 2016 Mercury Prize, and was later credited for introducing grime to a new generation of fans. In January 2017, Wiley released his eleventh studio album Godfather, debuting at number 9 in the charts.", "Other prominent artists include Deadly, who formed the grime group N.O.D.B, the first group from Birmingham to feature on BBC Radio 1Xtra; Mayhem, who is also a founding member of N.O.D.B, known for his bombastic sound and his 2012 feud with Wiley, C4, Sox, JayKae and SafOne. Many Birmingham artists have now had success outside the Birmingham region in recent years.

Stylistically, grime draws on many genres including UK garage, drum and bass, hip hop and dancehall. The lyrics and music combine futuristic electronic elements and dark, guttural basslines.", "Eskibeat was initially a name given to grime music by Wiley before grime was the agreed upon title. The term \"eskibeat\" is derived from Eskimo, indigenous people who live in the extremely cold northern circumpolar region. This reflected Wiley's mindset at the time, which was both \"angry\" and \"cold-hearted\". Eskibeat would later develop into a subgenre of grime, defined by the \"futuristic, icy cold synths, devastating basslines and awkward, off-kilter rhythms\" pioneered by Wiley in tracks like \"Igloo\" and \"Eskimo\", one of the first examples of grime music and eskibeat. Eskibeat production has had a massive impact on grime music, and has had an influence on UK drill.", "Notable producers of Eskibeat would be Wiley, Zomby, Danny Weed, and Lewi B.", "Rhythm & grime, also known as R&G or R'n'G, is a subgenre pioneered in 2004-5 by producers Terror Danjah, DaVinChe and Scratcha DVA, along with the support of BBC 1Xtra's DJ Cameo. The subgenre mixed grime with R&B, showcasing a softer side of grime, often with accompanying R&B vocals, while keeping the 140bpm rugged sound of grime. Many UK R&B singers, such as Sadie Ama, Lady Ny, Katie Pearl and Gemma Fox would perform over R&G instrumentals, usually without an MC rapping alongside them. Many grime artists also made various R&G tracks, such as Ruff Sqwad, Wiley, Kano, Skepta and Dizzee Rascal. Producers such as Blackjack, Iron Soul, Low Deep and Kid D also incorporated R&G elements into their instrumentals. Lady Ny has stated she was the first woman to sing on grime, and the first woman to bring out a grime mixtape.", "Sinogrime is a term coined by Kode9 in 2005 to describe a style of grime that incorporated East Asian motifs, such as traditional East Asian instruments and samples from vintage Kung Fu films. The style was present before this however, such as in Jammer's instrumental \"Chinaman\" which was released in 2003 and included a sample from the 1993 martial arts film Twin Warriors. The sound was initially pioneered by many people, such as DJ Target, Wiley, Terror Danjah, Ruff Sqwad, Jammer, Geenus, DJ Wonder and Wookie. In a 2003 interview, Wiley stated he \"used to watch a lot of Kung Fu films\" and used to go to a store called Sterns to find world music to sample. Dizzee Rascal stated his song \"Brand New Day\", released in 2003, was also inspired by Kung Fu films.", "The term does not necessarily apply to grime made in Japan or China, unless the instrumental includes East Asian motifs. Sinogrime first began being noticed in China in 2009 and would influence local producers, particularly in Shanghai and Beijing.

Beijing-based producer Howie Lee also produced an album with Sinogrime elements, called M\u00f9 Ch\u00e8 Sh\u0101n Ch\u016b. Howie Lee described sinogrime as \"propaganda\", a sound that represents an image in people's heads, but one that is not necessarily accurate.", "Sinogrime was described by music critic Dan Hancox as a genre that \"barely existed\". Dan Hancox suggested that sinogrime reflected a shift away from looking towards America for influence, and instead looking East.
