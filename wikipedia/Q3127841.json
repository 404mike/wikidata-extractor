After a win over Scotland, Thomas kept his place for the rest of the Championship, which saw victory over France and then Ireland. By beating all the other Home Nations, Wales won the Championship and collected the Triple Crown; and the victory over France, although not officially part of the tournament until the 1909/10 season, also gave Wales a Grand Slam of wins. Thomas played one more international match, the opening encounter with France for the 1910 Five Nations Championship, which Wales won 49-14.
