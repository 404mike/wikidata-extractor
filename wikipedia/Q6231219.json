As a junior officer, he was present at the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado in November 1845 during the Uruguayan Civil War. He also took part in operations in Sea of Azov during the Crimean War and went ashore with the quartermaster and a seaman, to destroy large quantities of enemy forage on the shore. After a difficult and dangerous journey they reached their objective \u2013 a magazine of corn \u2013 and managed to ignite the stacks, but the guards were alerted and immediately opened fire and gave chase. The men had difficulty in escaping, but they finally reached their ship and the lookouts later reported that the forage store had burned to the ground. He and his colleague, Quartermaster William Thomas Rickard, were awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\nCommerell went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope Station, Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station and then Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. He was also a Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1888.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)", "response": ["In practice the rank had lost its formal authority from 1828, when the professional head of the Royal Navy was given the title of First Naval Lord (renamed First Sea Lord in 1904). Thereafter it was periodically granted to retiring First Naval Lords as an honorary promotion, only passing to the most senior Admiral if there was no other candidate. On occasion even this seniority principle was abandoned, as on the death of Provo Wallis in 1892 when the promotion went to John Edmund Commerell rather than the senior Algernon Frederick Rous de Horsey."]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|John Edmund Commerell || Royal Navy || 1855 || Crimean War || Sea of Azov"]}, {"page": "John Commerell", "response": ["#Redirect John Edmund Commerell."]}, {"page": "William Thomas Rickard", "response": ["On 11 October 1855 in the Sea of Azov, Crimea, Quartermaster Rickard went with the commander (John Edmund Commerell) of  and a seaman to destroy large quantities of forage on the shore of the Sivash.

When he died in 1892 four admirals under him could immediately be promoted. By request of Queen Victoria, John Edmund Commerell became Admiral of the Fleet rather than Algernon Frederick Rous de Horsey, who as senior active admiral nearing the age limit would customarily have received the promotion; John Baird became an Admiral; James Erskine a vice-admiral; and Harry Rawson a rear-admiral. Ironically, all these younger men would die at least a decade before de Horsey. In the time before squadron distinctions were removed or age limits instituted, the death of James Hawkins-Whitshed resulted in ten men moving up to higher ranks."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir John Edmund Commerell"]}, {"page": "JE Commerell", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Edmund Commerell "]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Sir John Edmund Commerell"]}, {"page": "Groom in Waiting", "response": ["|26 May 1874 || rowspan=4| Captain John Edmund Commerell", "|31 December 1891 || rowspan=8| Admiral Sir John Edmund Commerell", "*23 June 1891\u201331 December 1891 Admiral Sir John Edmund Commerell"]}, {"page": "Naval Museum of Halifax", "response": ["VCJohnEdmundCommerell.jpg|John Edmund Commerell, Commerell was awarded the Victoria Cross for the Siege; served at Halifax (1882\u201385)"]}, {"page": "S.
