Writers ended this when they created an affair between Barry and Terry's wife, Sue Sullivan (Annie Miles). Producers then turned Barry into a murderer when he kills Sue and her young son Danny, by pushing them off a scaffolding. The story helped celebrate Brookside's 1000th episode and was played out as a \"whodunit\" story, with viewers initially unaware that Barry was responsible. Another notable plot included scenes in which Barry threatens to kill a dog. The story created controversy with viewer complaints and news stories. Other stories include his association with gangster Tommy McArdle (Malcolm Tierney), his relationship with  Tracy Corkhill (Justine Kerrigan) and her subsequent pregnancy. The character has proved popular with television critics and journalists, who often commented on Barry's numerous crimes and \"bad boy\" persona.

In addition, Young decided to kill off Sue's young son, Danny. Killing a child on-screen was controversial and had not been done before on a British soap opera. When the story was first pitched to writers, they believed it was too risky and they did not want to proceed. Young liked the reaction and decided that it would maximise interest in the show as they took it into the 1990s. To further add to the interest, Young wanted a \"whodunit\" narrative to keep the audience guessing. Only Young and Redmond knew that Sue and Danny would be murdered by Barry. They kept his identity a secret from Usher, the rest of the cast and the film crew. Young believed that in doing so, the story retained its authenticity as a mystery plot. The characters of Barry, Terry and Graeme Curtis were all dressed in white t-shirts, jeans and trainers.
