While Craig favoured stylised abstraction, Stanislavski, armed with his 'system,' explored psychological motivation. Craig conceived of the play as a symbolist monodrama, offering a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes alone. This was most evident in the staging of the first court scene. The most famous aspect of the production is Craig's use of large, abstract screens that altered the size and shape of the acting area for each scene, representing the character's state of mind spatially or visualising a dramaturgical progression. The production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre and placed it \"on the cultural map for Western Europe\"."]}, {"page": "Konstantin Stanislavski", "response": ["He collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his \"sole heir in the theatre\"), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov.Bablet (1962, 133\u2013158), Benedetti (1999a, 156, 188\u2013211, 368\u2013373), Braun (1995, 27\u201329), Roach (1985, 215\u2013216), Rudnitsky (1981, 56), and Taxidou (1998, 66\u201369).

A play could be adapted \"to the actor's inner experiences\", he explained to a sceptical Nemirovich. To support his position, Stanislavski cited Gogol's advice to \"take any play of Schiller or Shakespeare and stage it as contemporary art demands\" and Chekhov's delight at the MAT actor Ivan Moskvin's creative departure from Chekhov's intentions in his characterisation of Epikhodov in their production of The Cherry Orchard. One of his most important\u2014a collaboration with Edward Gordon Craig on a production of Hamlet\u2014became a landmark of 20th-century theatrical modernism.Bablet (1962, 133\u2013158), Benedetti (1999a, 188\u2013211), Senelick (1982, xvi), and Taxidou (1998, 66\u201369). Stanislavski hoped to prove that his recently developed 'system' for creating internally justified, realistic acting could meet the formal demands of a classic play.Bablet (1962, 135\u0096\u2013136, 153\u2013154, 156) and Benedetti (1999a, 189\u2013195). Craig envisioned a Symbolist monodrama in which every aspect of production would be subjugated to the protagonist: it would present a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes.Bablet (1962, 141\u2013142) and Benedetti (1999a, 189\u2013195).", "The French theatre practitioner Jacques Copeau contacted Stanislavski in October 1916.Benedetti (1999a, 248).

Director Leopold Jessner became famous for his expressionistic productions, often set on stark, steeply raked flights of stairs (having borrowed the idea from the Symbolist director and designer, Edward Gordon Craig). Staging was especially important in Expressionist drama, with directors forgoing the illusion of reality to block actors in as close to two-dimensional movement.
