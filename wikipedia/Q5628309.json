M. Trevelyan and H. J. Massingham. He described Massingham as \"perhaps the best of all present writers on Rural England\" and considered him among those writers who were \"so fond of the past that they seem sometimes almost to despair of the future\". Malcolm Chase, a historian, says that these authors, including Thomas himself, advocated an ultra-conservative, socially reactionary and idealistic philosophy that formed an important part of a national debate about the future of the land and agriculture. This attitude was coupled with an increasing public interest in pastimes such as cycling, motoring and walking; it was supported by the publication of popular, fairly cheap and colourful articles, books and maps that catered both to those pursuing such interests and those who were concerned about conservation and the effects of the influx of urban and suburban visitors. John Musty, in his comparative literary review of the works of Thomas and Massingham, believes that Thomas had a more \"gentle touch\" than Massingham, whose writings have \"frequently been judged as narrow and reactionary\"; he quotes Thomas as saying of the likes of Massingham that they \"preach an impossible creed, albeit an attractive one\"."]}, {"page": "The Regional Books (book series)", "response": ["|The Southern Marches||1952||H.

M. \"The Social and Economic Origins of the Vale of Evesham Market Gardening Industry\", The Agricultural History Review, v.33 (1985), 46 The ruralist writer H. J. Massingham, who was familiar with the operation of the Custom, expressed a belief that the tenant rights of Evesham were a direct descendant of those of the \"small masters\" who from the early mediaeval period practised cultivation in open fields owned by the Abbey.Massingham, H. J. \"Cottagers\" in Distributist Perspectives, vII, 2008 Massingham commented that after the 1874 agricultural depression, the area's large landlords split their farms up and let smaller parcels of land to labourers who were protected by the survival of ancient customary rights and by the local influence of Joseph Arch.  J. M. Martin has noted that an \"archaic\" form of life leasehold was practised in Pershore by the estates of the Duke of Westminster, where wills of the 18th century spoke of a \"tenant right of renewing\", and that a similarly archaic form of copyhold tenure was found in Shipston-on-Stour on land belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Worcester. Both had survived in areas where large estates had to manage many small tenancies, as in Evesham, and it is possible that a similar local tradition was the source of the rights enjoyed by the Vale of Evesham's market gardeners. Another view states that the Custom originated on a single small estate at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and subsequently spread throughout the district.Robinson, Agricultural Change, 1988, p.108"]}, {"page": "The Face of Britain (book series)", "response": ["* Chiltern Country by H.
