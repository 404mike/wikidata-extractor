The refrain of \"How to Disappear Completely\" was inspired by R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: \"I'm not here, this isn't happening\". The refrain of \"Optimistic\" (\"try the best you can / the best you can is good enough\") was an assurance by Yorke's partner, Rachel Owen, when Yorke was frustrated with the band's progress. The title Kid A came from a filename on one of Yorke's sequencers.

Don't look back and just carry on like nothing's happened.

Other songs reference science fiction, horror and fantasy, such as the wolves and vampires of \"A Wolf at the Door\" and \"We Suck Young Blood\", the reference to the slogan \"2 + 2 = 5\" in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, and the allusion to the giant of Gulliver's Travels in \"Go to Sleep\".Forbes, pg. 237."]}, {"page": "Thom Yorke", "response": ["On the strength of their first demo, On a Friday were offered a record deal by Island Records, but the members decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first.

Oxford University would have eaten me up and spat me out. It's too rigorous.\" In late 1988, Yorke left Oxford to study English and Fine Arts at the University of Exeter, which put On a Friday on hiatus aside from rehearsals during breaks.Randall, p. 43 At Exeter, Yorke performed experimental music with a classical ensemble, played in a techno group called Flickernoise, and played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met artist Stanley Donwood, who went on to produce artwork for Radiohead and Yorke's solo releases, and printmaker Rachel Owen, Yorke's future wife.Randall, p. 52 He credited his art school education for preparing him creatively for his later work.", "In a 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, Yorke said: \"In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. It's much harder to do that now ... If I was going to write a protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. It's not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone's mind.\" Working on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, Yorke worried that political songs alienated some listeners, but decided it was better than writing \"another lovey-dovey song about nothing\". Pitchfork wrote that Yorke's lyrics on A Moon Shaped Pool were less cynical, conveying wonder and amazement. Many critics felt the album's lyrics might address Yorke's separation from Rachel Owen, his partner of more than 20 years. However, in 2019, Yorke denied writing biographically, saying he instead writes \"spasmodic\" lyrics based on imagery.", "For 23 years, Yorke was in a relationship with artist and lecturer Rachel Owen, whom he met while studying at the University of Exeter. Their son, Noah, was born in 2001, and their daughter, Agnes, in 2004. Agnes collaborated on the artwork and Noah played drums on two tracks on Yorke's 2018 soundtrack album Suspiria. In 2012, Rolling Stone reported that Owen and Yorke were not married. However, The Times later found that they had married in a secret ceremony in Oxfordshire in May 2003. In August 2015, the couple announced they had separated amicably. Owen died from cancer on 18 December 2016, aged 48.

The lines \"No more going to the dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out\", from the track \"Atoms for Peace\", were inspired by an \"admonition\" from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. The song title references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. According to the Globe and Mail, \"The Clock\", influenced by Arabic music, is a \"gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'.\" \"Analyse\" was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: \"The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built.

In Consequence of Sound, Nina Corcoran wrote the long wait \"allowed Radiohead to peel its words when riper than ever\". Phoenix New Times writer Jozef speculated that the studio version was influenced by Yorke's recent separation from his partner of almost 25 years, Rachel Owen; whereas the early arrangement, likely written shortly after Yorke met Owen, has a \"hopeful, proud character\", the Moon Shaped Pool version sounds \"resigned, isolated, lost\".

Several critics felt the lyrics were coloured by Radiohead singer Thom Yorke's separation from his partner of 23 years Rachel Owen.

Artist Stanley Donwood created the abstract cover by exposing his paintings to weather.", "Godrich's father Vic died on the day of the recording of strings for \"Burn the Witch\". According to Godrich, \"I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this.\" Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. The special edition of the album is dedicated to Vic Godrich and drum technician Scott Johnson, who died in the 2012 stage collapse before Radiohead's scheduled show in Downsview Park, Toronto. Yorke told Rolling Stone: \"There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all.\"", "The lyrics discuss love, forgiveness, and regret with, according to Larson, \"a sense that beyond tectonic heartbreak there is an anaemic acceptance that is kind of beautiful if you don't get too sad about it\". Several critics felt the lyrics were coloured by Yorke's recent separation from his partner of almost 25 years, Rachel Owen, noting that the backmasked vocals of \"Daydreaming\", when reversed, resemble the words \"half of my life\".
