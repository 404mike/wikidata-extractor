He is the brother of Paul Griggs from the 1970s vocal group Guys 'n' Dolls. A professional musician since 1963, Nigel Griggs played in a number of bands, notably The Cortinas and Octopus, 1963\u20131971, with his brother Paul, Carmen and Steve Hillage's Khan. \nHe has been playing bass since he was 14 years old, because his brother's band needed a bassist. His other hobbies include photography, sound recording and Football.Griggs joined Split Enz in 1977 at the same time Neil Finn did, at the recommendation of the current drummer and close friend of Griggs, Malcolm Green. Griggs stayed with the Enz until their 1984 split. After the split, he joined Enz drummer Noel Crombie, Enz keyboardist Eddie Rayner, Split Enz founder Phil Judd and the guitarist Michael den Elzen in the band Schnell Fenster.\nIn 1996, when Crowded House split up and released their greatest hits album Recurring Dream, frontman Neil Finn approached Griggs to put together a collection of the band's greatest live performances, to append selected copies of Recurring Dream.In 2002, Griggs released a solo album, Sleeper, through the Split Enz fanclub, Frenz of the Enz.Due to being a core member, he has always participated in major Split Enz's reunions.

Chrysalis issued Mental Notes (the American title of Second Thoughts) in the USA, and at the end of February they set off for the US to support the album. The 23 day/40 show tour was a first attempt to establish themselves in America but it marked the end of an era in the band and proved to be the last tour with founding members Phil Judd and Mike Chunn. Chunn decided to leave at the end of the US tour, partly because he wanted to spend more time with his family but also because he suffered from agoraphobia. But tensions were also increasing between Phil and Tim. Although the band received a standing ovation in San Francisco, audience reactions in more remote areas ranged from puzzlement to outright hostility, and Phil was extremely sensitive to such negative reactions. Also like Mike Chunn he had a young family back in New Zealand and was tired of the endless grind of touring. The tensions climaxed after a concert when Phil, who was having trouble with an out-of-tune guitar, stormed off before the end of the set and when Tim challenged him backstage about what had happened, Phil punched him. The tour ended in April, and Phil left the band. They were due to begin their third English tour later that month, so Tim now took charge and hastily reorganised the group. On 4 April English bassist Nigel Griggs (ex-Octopus) was hired to replace Mike Chunn, who gave Tim a crucial piece of parting advice\u2014he suggested Tim's younger brother Neil as the replacement for Phil Judd. At the time Neil was playing in local Auckland band Afterhours, led by Geoff Chunn, plus Neil and Mark Hough, (aka Buster Stiggs who later joined The Swingers with Phil Judd).
