The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal, becoming one of the most successful extreme metal bands to date. John Serba of AllMusic commented that their first album \"made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage\". Some black metal fans did not consider Cradle of Filth to be black metal. When asked if he considers Cradle of Filth a black metal band, vocalist Dani Filth said he considers them black metal in terms of philosophy and atmosphere, but not in other ways. Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but \"began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area\" and \"almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result\". Dayal Patterson says successful acts like Cradle of Filth \"provoked an even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground\" scene due to concerns about \"selling out\".Patterson, Dayal.

Additionally, the album Dusk... and Her Embrace (1996) was largely inspired by Carmilla and Le Fanu's writings in general.

The band's musical style evolved originally from black metal to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. The band consists of its founding member, vocalist Dani Filth, drummer Martin 'Marthus' \u0160karoupka, bassist Daniel Firth, guitarists Richard Shaw and Marek 'Ashok' \u0160merda, and keyboardist Anabelle Iratni.", "Cradle of Filth's first three years saw three demos (Invoking the Unclean, Orgiastic Pleasures Foul and Total Fucking Darkness) recorded amidst the sort of rapid line-up fluctuations that have continued ever since, with the band having more than thirty musicians in its history. An album entitled Goetia was recorded prior to the third demo and set for release on Tombstone Records, but all tracks were wiped when Tombstone went out of business and the band could not afford to buy the recordings from the studio. The band eventually signed to Cacophonous Records, and their debut album, The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, was Cacophonous's first release in 1994. A step-up in terms of production from the rehearsal quality of most of their demos, the album was still nevertheless a sparse and embryonic version of what was to come, with lead singer Dani Filth's vocals in particular bearing little similarity to the style he was later to develop. The album was well-received however, and as recently as June 2006 found its way into Metal Hammer's list of the top ten black metal albums of the last twenty years.", "Thornography was released in October 2006. According to Dani Filth, the title \"represents mankind's obsession with sin and self... an addiction to self-punishment or something equally poisonous... a mania.\" On the subject of the album's musical direction, Filth told Revolver magazine, \"I'm not saying it's 'experimental', but we're definitely testing the limits of what we can do... A lot of the songs are really rhythmical\u2014thrashy, almost\u2014but they're all also really catchy.\" A flurry of pre-release controversy saw Samuel Araya's original cover artwork scrapped and replaced in May 2006, although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. Thornography received a similar reception to Nymphetamine, garnering generally positive reviews, but raising a few eyebrows with the inclusion of a cover of Heaven 17's \"Temptation\" (featuring guest vocals from Dirty Harry), which was released as a digital single and accompanying video shortly before the album. Thornography entered the Billboard chart at No.\u00a066, having sold nearly 13,000 copies.", "Cradle's relationship with Roadrunner came to an end in April 2010, with the announcement that the band's next album would be released by the British independent label Peaceville Records, using Cradle's own Abracadaver imprint. Dani Filth cited \"the artistic restrictions and mindless inhibitions imposed by a major label\" as the band's reason for going independent. Early press releases named the new album All Hallows Eve, but by August 2010 the title was confirmed as Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa. Released on 1 November 2010, it is a concept album in the same vein as its predecessor, Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder; this time centring on the demon Lilith, the first wife of the biblical Adam, and also making reference to Greek, Egyptian and Sumerian mythology, the Knights Templar and the Carmelite Nuns. The label referred to it as \"a dark tapestry of horror, madness and twisted sex\", while Filth called its sound \"creepily melodic, like Mercyful Fate or a dark Iron Maiden\". Metal Hammer's Dom Lawson felt it was \"another sumptuous and spectacular eruption of gothic melodrama, perverted sonic schlock and balls-out extreme metal bombast\", and likened it to an \"instalment in an ongoing series of novels.\"", "In April 2012, the compilation album Midnight in the Labyrinth was released, featuring orchestral re-recordings of songs from the band's first three albums and the V Empire EP. Dani Filth had described it in the preceding months as \"reinventing\" the tracks as \"full soundtrack quality stuff... with choirs, strings and some narration\". This album's version of \"Summer Dying Fast\" was included on Evermore Darkly as a teaser for the full release (the Evermore track listing subtitles this version \"Midnight in the Labyrinth breadcrumb trail\"), and \"A Gothic Romance (Red Roses for the Devil's Whore)\" was released online via Peaceville's website on 4 April.

Dani Filth stated about Allender departing the band: \"Paul has been enthralled [sic] in his own project and he could not do the tour due to personal reasons. Since then the band has grown as a unit, we were only writing as one guitarist for the last three records and we now have two very competent guitarists. Paul had a very strong opinion about doing that [writing single guitar parts], and we're a two-guitar band. So that may be one of the things that kind of opened the fissure a bit.\"", "On 2 April 2014, Cradle of Filth's website announced that they were working on their follow-up to The Manticore and Other Horrors.

The band have cited acts that were heavily influential to black metal such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said \"I use the term 'heavy metal', rather than 'black metal', because I think that's a bit of a fad now. Call it what you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...\". Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that \"few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days.\" In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer, then-guitarist Paul Allender said, \"We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out\u2014you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff\u2014we didn't sound anything like that.
