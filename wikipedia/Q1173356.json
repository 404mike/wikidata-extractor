He ended his playing career with Cambridge United before returning to Norwich city to coach the youth team, winning the FA Youth Cup in 1984. He went on to manage the reserve team and was appointed first team manager in December 1987 following the sacking of Ken Brown.\nHe saved Norwich from relegation that season, and in his first full season (1988\u201389) Norwich emerged as an unlikely contender for the league title and FA Cup; they finished fourth in the league and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Norwich reached another FA Cup semi-final in 1992, narrowly avoided relegation that season. Stringer then resigned.\nDuring his management, Norwich had one of its most successful spells but never again would he hold another managerial position; he returned to Carrow Road as a member of the coaching staff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich", "response": [" The principal local football club is Norwich City, known as the Canaries. In 2020\u201321 it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for 2021\u201322. Majority-owned by celebrity chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is Carrow Road Stadium. It has strong East Anglian rivalry with Ipswich Town. The club has enjoyed much success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has won two Football League Cups, and finished third in the inaugural Premier League in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions. Perhaps its most famous result came in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup, in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but been unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated Manchester United from the FA Cup in 1959 and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some highly-rated talent of that era, including striker Chris Sutton, winger Ruel Fox, defender Andy Linighan, midfielder Mike Phelan, midfielder Tim Sherwood and striker Justin Fashanu. The club's successful managers have included Ken Brown, Ron Saunders, Dave Stringer, Mike Walker, Nigel Worthington and Paul Lambert."]}, {"page": "Norwich City F.C.", "response": ["|1972|| Dave Stringer", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Dave Stringer"]}, {"page": "Chris Sutton", "response": ["He started his career at Norwich City, initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager Dave Stringer.
