The Evans family  had made a fortune from lead mines at Bonsall, and an iron slitting and rolling mill in Derby and a cotton mill at Darley Abbey. They also owned the Evans Bank in Derby. \n\nEvans was Member of Parliament (MP) for East Retford from 1818 to 1820, and in 1826 unsuccessfully contested Leicester at a cost of between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000. In 1830 a compromise was reached and Evans was returned for Leicester without a poll, the same happening in 1831 when Evans was a reformist. Evans was re-elected in the 1832 Reformed parliament, but lost his seat in 1835. He was then elected for North Derbyshire in 1837 and held the seat until 1853, when he resigned by taking the Chiltern Hundreds.\nEvans became High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1829 and was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire and J. P.. He lived at Allestree Hall and was philanthropic in his support of schools and churches.\nEvans married Mary Gisborne, daughter of Rev. Thomas Gisborne of Yoxall Lodge in July 1820.
