Grant (fl.\u20091830\u20131852) was a British artist and illustrator, chiefly remembered for his work as an engraver of political caricatures during the mid-1830s. His most remarkable work was The Political Drama (1833\u20131836), a series of 131 wood-engraved political satires expressing the views of the Radical movement and attacking the conduct of the Whig and Tory factions for failing to introduce more democratic constitutional reforms. He would go on to produce woodcuts for several Chartist newspaper titles during the late-1830s and early-1840s but his career appears to have entered a period of decline thereafter. His last known print was published in 1852 and it is possible that he died shortly thereafter. He typically signed his prints \"C.J. Grant\" or \"C.J.G.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Grant", "response": ["* Charles Jameson Grant, American editorial cartoonist"]}, {"page": "Before 1900s in comics", "response": ["* July 15: Charles Jameson Grant publishes Adventures of the Buggins's in three strips with speech balloons in Every Body's Album and Caricature Magazine #14.", "* Charles Jameson Grant, British illustrator, engraver and comics artist (Adventures of the Buggins's), dies at age 30."]}, {"page": "Edward Lloyd (publisher)", "response": ["To begin with, he was able to support himself by selling cheap items such as cards and songs.
