In the autumn of 1767, he wrote to the Earl of Shelburne, then the Southern Secretary, asking him to intercede on behalf of William Pearce and Richard Williams. The two had been condemned to death at the summer assizes at Bodmin for wrecking, and opinion in Morice's boroughs running much in their favour, he felt obliged to act on their behalf. In the event, Williams was reprieved by his judge and sentenced to transportation, while Pearce was hanged. Morice again put forth his candidates unchallenged at the 1768 election, and was chosen recorder of Launceston in 1771. But his influence was fading, and in the 1774 election, he anticipated a serious contest there, nominating himself and Richard Bull in both of his boroughs. While Morice finished at the head of the poll for Launceston, Bull was defeated by the challenger, John Buller. Morice chose to sit for Launceston, and put in John Frederick at Newport, but the event seems to have crystallised his resolution to leave politics. In early 1775, he sold Werrington to the Duke of Northumberland for a sum reputed to be nearly \u00a3100,000. Morice informed Lord North of his decision in a written memorial, explaining that the expense of electioneering (\u00a33,000 per year above and beyond the \u00a31,200 revenues of Werrington), the effects of his gout, the prodigality of his steward in maintaining his interest, and his check in the 1774 elections had all convinced him to give up control of the boroughs."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1796 British general election", "response": ["| Sir John Frederick, Bt"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1774 British general election", "response": ["| Humphry Morice \u2013 sat for LauncestonReplaced by John Frederick 1775"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1780 British general election", "response": ["| James Harris  \u2013  died replaced by (Sir) John Frederick 1783"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1784 British general election", "response": ["| (Sir) John Frederick"]}, {"page": "List of MPs in the first United Kingdom Parliament", "response": ["| Sir John Frederick, Bt"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir John Frederick, Bt"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1802 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir John Frederick, Bt"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1790 British general election", "response": ["|  William Clement Finch \u2013 died Replaced by Sir John Frederick"]}, {"page": "Sir John Frederick, 4th Baronet", "response": ["Sir John Frederick, 4th Baronet (28 November 1708 - 9 April 1783), was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1740 and 1763.thePeerage.com"]}, {"page": "2nd Royal Surrey Militia", "response": ["The first officers appointed to the 1st Surrey Supplementary Militia on 2 January 1797 included Colonel the Hon Thomas Onslow, Member of Parliament (MP) for Guildford and eldest son of the Lord Lieutenant of Surrey, Lord Onslow, and his Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir John Frederick, 5th Baronet, MP for Surrey.The Onslows at Queen's Royal Surreys.Burke's: 'Onslow'."]}]}}
