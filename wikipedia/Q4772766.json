As a leading proponent of British High Tech architecture and with a strong interest in both engineering and industrial design, Hunt was a major player in creating the High Tech movement of Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. He formed Anthony Hunt Associates in 1962. He worked with Rogers and Foster on Reliance Controls building in Swindon (1966) which was the first building of the British High Tech architecture, or more generally the High Tech architecture style. He was also a structural engineer on the Waterloo International railway station in London (1993).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stirling Prize", "response": ["*Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, Anthony Hunt for Eden Project, Cornwall"]}, {"page": "James Dyson", "response": ["James Dyson was born 2 May 1947 in Cromer, Norfolk, one of three children, and named after his grandfather, James Dyson. He was educated at Gresham's School, an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of prostate cancer. He excelled at long-distance running: \"I was quite good at it, not because I was physically good, but because I had more determination. I learnt determination from it.\" He spent one year (1965\u20131966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966\u20131970) before moving into engineering. It was while attending the Royal College of Art to study fine art that Dyson made the switch to industrial design due in part to the tutorage of the structural engineer Anthony Hunt."]}, {"page": "City, University of London", "response": ["Alumni include Colin Cherry, Stuart Davies and Anthony Hunt.

Rather than simply extending the existing structure as had been envisaged 15 years earlier, it was decided to look below ground. The sloping site allowed for an enlarged basement to emerge at a curved glass frontage overlooking a man-made lake (an echo of the nearby 13th century Norfolk Broads).

Steel, aluminium, glass, and concrete are all commonly found in high-tech structures, as these elements evoke a feeling of being mass-produced and widely available. Not all high-tech designs are made to accommodate truly mass-produced materials, but nonetheless seek to convey a sense of factory creation and broad distribution. Tensile structures, cross beams, and exposed support and maintenance elements are all important components found in high-tech designs. A focus on strong, simplistic, and transparent elements all connect high-tech as a style to the principles of engineering. The engineer Anthony Hunt was hugely influential in both the design, choice of materials, and ultimate expression of many of the earliest high-tech buildings in Britain, and as such many of these designs are suffused with a focus on the aesthetics of engineering and construction."]}, {"page": "List of structural engineers", "response": ["* Anthony Hunt"]}, {"page": "Waterloo International railway station", "response": ["Waterloo International had five platforms, numbered 20 to 24, one (20) taken from the mainline station, and four new ones. Unlike the platforms at the main station, they were long enough to accommodate trains of up to 20 coaches (total length 394 metres). The platforms were all covered by a 400\u00a0m long glass and steel vault of 36 arches forming a prismatic structure, conceived by Anthony Hunt Associates. The five vaults are supported by a grid of cylindrical concrete columns that rise up from the carpark level, through the circulation levels to the platforms.

The curvature of the roof is steeper on the western side and here the trains passed close to the structure. The roof arches are made up of two dissimilar curved trusses, triangular in section, with compression booms of tubular steel (CFS) and tension booms of solid steel. Both compression and tension members are curved \u2013 structural engineer Anthony Hunt described the trusses as \"banana shaped\".
