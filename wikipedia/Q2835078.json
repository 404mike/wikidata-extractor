During a long career Drury created a great number of decorative figures such as busts and statuettes plus larger monuments, war memorials, statues of royalty and architectural pieces. During the opening years of the 20th-century he was among the foremost architectural sculptors active in Britain and in that period created the series of works in central London for which he is perhaps now best known. These include the figures on the Old War Office building in Whitehall, elements of the facade of the Victoria and Albert Museum and four of the colossal statues on Vauxhall Bridge.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joshua Reynolds", "response": ["Reynolds was buried at St Paul's Cathedral.\"Memorials of St Paul's Cathedral\" Sinclair, W. p. 465: London; Chapman & Hall, Ltd; 1909.

Riley proposed erecting two  pylons topped with statues at one end of the bridge, and adding decorative sculpture to the bridge piers.

While Kingston was instrumental in bringing about several progressive social policies, such as electoral reform (including the first law to give votes to women in Australia), a legitimation Act, the first conciliation and arbitration act in Australia, and a progressive system of taxation, he was also one of the main architects of the White Australia policy. After the Black Lives Matter gained pace in June 2020, with various statues representing slave traders and various perpetrators of racism being removed or defaced both in the US and in the UK during the George Floyd protests, archaeologist and historian Jacinta Koolmatrie pointed out the irony of the statue being placed so close to the Aboriginal flag in the square, which was also the site of the Adelaide Black Lives Matter protest."]}, {"page": "City Square, Leeds", "response": ["The famous chemist and theologian Joseph Priestley lived in Leeds from 1767 to 1773, and was the minister at Mill Hill Chapel, which is on the square.
