He is notable for both A Dictionary of Modern English Usage and his work on the Concise Oxford Dictionary, and was described by The Times as \"a lexicographical genius\".\nAfter an Oxford education, Fowler was a schoolmaster until his middle age and then worked in London as a freelance writer and journalist, but was not very successful. In partnership with his brother Francis, beginning in 1906, he began publishing seminal grammar, style and lexicography books. After his brother's death in 1918, he completed the works on which they had collaborated and edited additional works.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 26", "response": ["*  1933   \u2013 Henry Watson Fowler, English lexicographer and educator (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "Guernsey", "response": ["Henry Watson Fowler moved to Guernsey in 1903.
