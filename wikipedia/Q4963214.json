There was a similar, but short-lived, scheme in the late 1960s when at least three supply officers were trained as helicopter aircrew; at least one \"pusser pilot\" served in a number of flying appointments.", "Only two Supply Officers have ever been promoted to the rank of 'full' admiral.  Retiring as chief of fleet support in 1977, Admiral Sir Peter White GBE (born 1919) was promoted on 28 June 1976, becoming the first of the branch to be appointed to the Admiralty Board.  He had a most appropriate surname for the first four-star pusser, given the colour of the distinction cloth worn historically by his branch.  Admiral Sir Brian Brown KCB, CBE was promoted to that rank on 26 August 1989.  Happily, there has been at least one serving Supply Officer with the surname Purser \u2013 Benjamin Purser was promoted lieutenant-commander in July 1973. While there have also certainly been supply officers with the surname of Cook, perhaps the surnames Beauclerk, Bezant, Cater, Clark(e)/Clerk(e), Pay, Purves/Purvis, Scriven(er), Steward and Storer have been those of supply officers, too, over the centuries."]}, {"page": "List of Supply Officers in the Royal Navy who have reached flag rank", "response": ["# Admiral Sir Brian Brown (personal correspondence)"]}, {"page": "Brian Brown", "response": ["* Brian Brown (Australian footballer) (born 1957), Australian rules footballer", "* Brian Brown (football coach) (born 1957), Australian association football player and coach", "* Brian Brown (Jamaican footballer) (born 1992), Jamaican footballer", "* Brian Brown (high jumper) (born 1967), American high jumper, former director of the Drake Relays", "* Brian Brown (racing driver) (born 1978), American race car driver", "* Brian Brown (musician) (1933\u20132013), Australian jazz saxophonist", "* Box Brown (Brian Brown, born 1980), American cartoonist", "* Brian Brown (Royal Navy officer) (1934\u20132020)", "* Brian Brown (North Carolina politician) (born 1979), American politician", "* Brian Browne (1937\u20132018), Canadian jazz pianist and composer"]}, {"page": "Admiral Brown", "response": ["*Brian Brown (Royal Navy officer) (1934\u20132020), Royal Navy admiral"]}, {"page": "Royal Naval College, Greenwich", "response": ["*Admiral Sir Brian Brown (1988\u20131991)'Brown, Adm.
