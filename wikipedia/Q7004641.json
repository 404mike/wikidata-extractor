From an impoverished home background, and mainly self-educated, he became The Manchester Guardian's cricket correspondent in 1919 and its chief music critic in 1927, holding the two posts simultaneously until 1940. His contributions to these two distinct fields in the years before the Second World War established his reputation as one of the foremost critics of his generation.\nCardus's approach to cricket writing was innovative, turning what had previously been largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism\u2014subjective, romantic and personal, in contrast to the objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.\nCardus spent the Second World War years in Australia, where he wrote for The Sydney Morning Herald and gave regular radio talks. He also wrote books on music, and completed his autobiography. After his return to England he resumed his connection with The Manchester Guardian as its London music critic. He continued to write on cricket, and produced books on both his specialisms. Cardus's work was publicly recognised by his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964 and the award of a knighthood in 1967, while the music and cricket worlds acknowledged him with numerous honours. In his last years, he became a guru and inspirational figure to aspiring young writers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. G.

In May 1944, at EMI's Abbey Road Studios with Gerald Moore as her accompanist, she made test recordings of music by Brahms, Gluck and Elgar. Her first published record, made in September 1944, was issued under the Columbia label; it consisted of two songs by Maurice Greene, again with Moore accompanying.Campion, pp. 5\u20136 Her time as a Columbia recording artist was brief and unhappy; she had poor relations with her producer, Walter Legge, and after a few months she transferred to Decca.Campion, pp. 8\u201311", "During the remainder of 1952 Ferrier attended her seventh successive Edinburgh Festival, singing in performances of Das Lied, The Dream of Gerontius, Messiah and some Brahms songs.Leonard, pp. 217\u2013219 She undertook several studio recording sessions, including a series of Bach and Handel arias with Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in October.Campion, pp. 97\u201398 In November, after a Royal Festival Hall recital, she was distressed by a review in which Neville Cardus criticised her performance for introducing \"distracting extra vocal appeals\" designed to please the audience at the expense of the songs. However, she accepted his comments with good grace, remarking that \"...\u00a0it's hard to please everybody\u2014for years I've been criticised for being a colourless, monotonous singer\".Fifield (ed.), p. 181 In December she sang in the BBC's Christmas Messiah, the last time she would perform this work.

In the 1930s Sir Thomas Beecham told the critic Neville Cardus, \"I would give the whole of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos for Massenet's Manon, and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange.\"Cardus, p. 29 By the 1950s critics were reappraising Massenet's works. In 1951 Martin Cooper of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Massenet's detractors, including some fellow composers, were on the whole idealistic, even puritanical, \"but few of them have in practice achieved anything so near perfection in any genre, however humble, as Massenet achieved in his best works.\"Cooper, French Music (1951), quoted in Hughes and van Thal, p. 250 In 1955 Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor commented in The Record Guide that, although usually dismissed as an inferior Gounod, Massenet wrote music with a distinct flavour of its own. \"He had a gift for melody of a suave, voluptuous and eminently singable kind, and the intelligence and dramatic sense to make the most of it.\" The writers called for revivals of Gris\u00e9lidis, Le jongleur de Notre-Dame, Don Quichotte and Cendrillon, all then neglected.Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 433 By the 1990s, Massenet's reputation had been considerably rehabilitated. In The Penguin Opera Guide (1993), Hugh Macdonald wrote that though Massenet's operas never equalled the grandeur of Berlioz's Les Troyens, the genius of Bizet's Carmen or the profundity of Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, from the 1860s until the years before the First World War, the composer gave the French lyric stage a remarkable series of works, two of which \u2013 Manon and Werther \u2013 are \"masterpieces that will always grace the repertoire\". In Macdonald's view, Massenet \"embodies many enduring aspects of the belle \u00e9poque, one of the richest cultural periods in history\".Macdonald, pp. 216\u2013217 In France, Massenet's 20th-century eclipse was less complete than elsewhere, but his oeuvre has been revalued in recent years. In 2003 Piotr Kaminsky wrote in Mille et un op\u00e9ras of Massenet's skill in translating French text into flexible melodic phrases, his exceptional orchestral virtuosity, combining sparkle and clarity, and his unerring theatrical instinct.Kaminsky, p. 864 Begun by Jean-Louis Pichon in November 1990, the Massenet Festival in Massenet's native Saint-\u00c9tienne have produced biennial performances to promote and celebrate his music."]}, {"page": "Rusholme", "response": ["The cricket writer and music critic Neville Cardus (1888\u20131975) was born in Rusholme, as were musicians Roy Harper (born 1941) and Marc Riley (born 1961), actors Alan Badel (1923\u20131982) and Tina O'Brien (born 1983), and the novelist and dramatist Ian Hay: John Hay Beith (1876\u20131952).

He did not reach three figures again that season, but his performances and batting technique impressed several critics, such as cricket correspondent Neville Cardus, former England and Middlesex captain Plum Warner, and The Times correspondent; Cardus described him as a future England player.Howat, pp. 22\u201323. In all first-class matches that season, Hammond scored 1,421 runs at an average of 27.86. With the ball, he took 18 first-class wickets at an average of 41.22, including figures of six for 59 against Hampshire. Reviewing the season, Wisdens correspondent declared that Hammond \"has all the world before him and there is no telling how far he may go\".Howat, p. 23.", "Selected for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1936\u201337 under the captaincy of Gubby Allen, Hammond was again part of the tour selection committee. He was successful with bat and ball, scoring 1,206 runs (average 67.00) and taking 21 wickets (average 24.57) in all first-class matches in Australia (he played two more in New Zealand at the conclusion of the tour). In Tests, Hammond scored 468 runs at an average of 58.50 and took 12 wickets at an average of 25.08. His tour began with four consecutive first-class hundreds against the state teams, but Wisden reported that he never recaptured this form during the remainder of the tour, owing to the bowling of Bill O'Reilly. Hammond could not overcome O'Reilly's use of slow leg theory in the later Tests which restricted scoring. England won the first two Tests, although Hammond did not contribute in the first, making a first ball duck. In the second he scored an unbeaten 231, then took three for 29 with the ball in Australia's second innings, during a period when the other bowlers lost control. From this point, his contributions fell away, although he believed that the best innings of his life, on one of the most difficult pitches he ever confronted, was his 32 in the third Test. Neville Cardus, who saw it, described it as remarkable. However, his free-scoring 51 in the second innings was not enough to prevent defeat in the face of an unrealistic target.Hammond, p. 128. In the fourth Test, Hammond took five for 57 in Australia's second innings, but his dismissal on the final morning by Fleetwood-Smith ensured that Australia won the match to level the series. One of Hammond's teammates opined that Bradman would not have been dismissed as easily in a similar situation.Cardus, p. 128.Gibson, p. 173.

Previously, batsmen had generally pushed forward; Ranji took advantage of the improving quality of pitches in his era and played more on the back foot, both in defence and attack. He is particularly associated with one shot, the leg glance, which he invented or popularised. The first-class cricket tournament in India, the Ranji Trophy, was named in his honour and inaugurated in 1935 by the Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. His nephew Duleepsinhji followed Ranji's path as a batsman playing first-class cricket in England and for the England cricket team.", "In his day, Ranjitsinhji's batting was regarded as innovative and history has come to look upon him as \"one of the most original stylists to have ever played the game\". His great friend and Sussex captain, C. B. Fry commented on Ranji's \"distinctiveness\", attributing it to \"a combination of perfect poise and the quickness peculiar to the athletic Hindu\".
