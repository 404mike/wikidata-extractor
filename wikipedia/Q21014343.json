In 1946 Ryle and Derek Vonberg were the first people to publish interferometric astronomical measurements at radio wavelengths. With improved equipment, Ryle observed the most distant known galaxies in the universe at that time. He was the first Professor of Radio Astronomy in the University of Cambridge and founding director of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory. He was the twelfth Astronomer Royal from 1972 to 1982.About Sir Martin Ryle Ryle and Antony Hewish shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research.Press release about Martin Ryle's Nobel Prize. In the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent."]}, {"page": "W\u00fcrzburg radar", "response": ["German radar equipment including two W\u00fcrzburg antennae (obtained from RAE Farnborough) was used by Martin Ryle and Derek Vonberg at the Cavendish Laboratory from 1945 to observe sunspots.CAVMAG - News from the Cavendish Laboratory, August 2015, Page 20"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Derek Vonberg, 93, British physicist.
