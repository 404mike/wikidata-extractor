The  Biblical \"Samson\", in the vernacular of the day, came from Longfellow's 1865 poem, \"The Warning\", containing the line, \"There is a poor, blind Samson in the land\" To explain the metaphor \"Sampson\", John Elliott Cairnes, an Irish political economist, in his 1865 article about Black suffrage, wrote that Longfellow was prophesizing; to wit: in \"the long-impending struggle for Americans following the Civil War, [he, Longfellow] could see in the Negro only an instrument of vengeance, and a cause of ruin\". The phrase, instrument of vengeance was also referenced in the 1831 work, The Confessions of Nat Turner, published by Thomas Ruffin Gray, wherein Turner explains how he saw the divine signs \u2013 God's will to eradicate the evil of slavery \u2013 that (a) vindicated him as an instrument of vengeance and (b) established his prophetic status.  However, Cairnes, in the article, went on to explain that Longfellow's prediction did not transpire: \"The hour of grim revel at length came, and the American Sampson  raised his hand, but for a purpose far different than that which the poet dreaded \u2013 not to shake, but to stay up the tottering temple of American liberties \u2013 that temple in which he had only received insult and unutterable wrong.\""]}, {"page": "John Elliot Cairnes", "response": ["#redirectJohn Elliott Cairnes"]}, {"page": "J.
