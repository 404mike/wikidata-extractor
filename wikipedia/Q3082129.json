Russell Smith, Emeritus Professor of Economic Geography at Columbia University, published \"Tree Crops \u2013 A Permanent Agriculture\" which stated that crop-yielding trees could provide useful substitutes for cereals in animal feeding programs, as well as conserve environmental health.Douglas 1984 Toyohiko Kagawa read and was heavily influenced by Smith\u2019s publication and began experimental cultivation under trees in Japan during the 1930s. Through forest farming, or three-dimensional forestry, Kagawa addressed problems of soil erosion by persuading many of Japan's upland farmers to plant fodder trees to conserve soil, supply food and feed animals. He combined extensive plantings of walnut trees, harvested the nuts and fed them to the pigs, then sold the pigs as a source of income. When the walnut trees matured, they were sold for timber and more trees were planted so that there was a continuous cycle of economic cropping that provided both short-term and long-term income to the small landowner.Douglas 1984  The success of these trials prompted similar research in other countries. World War II disrupted communication and slowed advances in forest farming.Douglas 1984  In the mid-1950s research resumed in places such as southern Africa.
