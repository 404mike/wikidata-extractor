His sea-songs form a class by themselves: they are calculated alike to cheer solitude and to animate social assemblages, to raise the laugh and the tear, and to engrave on the heart benevolence, courage, and a trust in Providence.\"J. Adolphus, Memoirs of John Bannister, Comedian Vol. 2 (Richard Bentley, London 1839), pp. 174\u201376.

In accepting this offer the tenor narrowly missed a better one \u2013 for higher fees and a longer term \u2013 made soon afterwards by Thomas Linley. Incledon kept his agreement however, although his experiences with Covent Garden were not always of the happiest. He made a successful debut there in 1790 as Dermont in The Poor Soldier by William Shield, who became a lifelong friend and associate. In February 1791 he appeared in Shield's opera The Woodman, being universally encored in his ballad 'The streamlet', and with Charles Bannister in the same cast singing 'Much more a helpless woman'.W. Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830), vol. 1, p. 136. ", "At Covent Garden, Incledon successfully took on as a tenor several important roles created by his friend the celebrated bass Charles Bannister, about a generation after the original productions. Thus he appeared as Tom Tug in Dibdin's The Waterman (first presented at the Haymarket in 1774)G.H. Davidson, The Songs of Charles Dibdin with a memoir by George Hogarth, 2 vols (G.H. Davidson, London 1848), I, pp. xx, xxxiii, 44\u201345. and in 1809 took the role of Mr. Steady in Dibdin's The Quaker (first presented at Drury Lane in 1777).The British Drama: A Collection of the Most Esteemed Tragedies, Comedies, Operas, and Farces, in the English Language. In Two Volumes, (Jones & Co., London 1824), Vol. 1, p. 233.A propos The Quaker, it is amusingly related that Incledon, finding himself in Margate to play Mr Steady without a suitable costume, induced a 'comfortable plump-looking Quaker' whom he met in the street to lend him his clothes for the night: and the Quaker attended the performance from a hidden vantage, to see how his people were represented. See Mrs Mathews, Memoir of Charles Mathews, Comedian (Richard Bentley, London 1838), Vol. 2, pp. 201\u201303 In 1810, similarly, he appeared as the Serjeant in Isaac Bickerstaffe's musical entertainment of The Recruiting Serjeant (formerly produced at the Royalty Theatre in 1789, first 1770),The British Drama, 1824, p. 210. and in 1814 as Mr. Belville (another Bannister role) in Mrs Brook's opera Rosina (presented first at Covent Garden in 1783).The British Drama, 1824, p. 241. Since the airs or ballads in these musical dramas stood alone with spoken dialogue, the transposition from bass to tenor did not create excessive difficulty.", "His friendship and professional involvement with William Shield, from his first days at Covent Garden, set the character of his career. He and Shield, Charles Bannister, Charles Dignum, 'Jack' Johnstone, Charles Ashley and William Parke in 1793 formed themselves into 'The Glee Club', a set which met on Sunday evenings during the season at the Garrick's Head Coffee House in Bow Street, once a fortnight, for singing among themselves and dining together.W. Parke, Musical memoirs (1830), pp. 175\u201379. Many of Shield's songs were either written for him or were sung by him, with the composer's high approval. Shield said of him that, not only did Incledon's interpretation of the songs he had written for him never disappoint his expectation, but that he often brought a grace, beauty and charm to them which the composer had not imagined to be present in his own work, and that a large share of the popularity of those songs might be credited to Incledon's unrivalled excellence in singing them. Many songs were written for him also by George Baker (1773\u20131847), the composer and organist of Stafford and Derby, who had been a fellow-pupil of Incledon's under Jackson at Exeter.W.H.

On 24 July 1771 at that house Master Suett was the original Cupid in 'Dido,' a comic opera assigned to Thomas Bridges. Charles Bannister then obtained for him an engagement on the York circuit with Tate Wilkinson, with whom he remained as singer and second low comedian for nine years, at the largest salary Wilkinson ever paid. His first appearance was made on 22 November 1771 in Hull, where he sang a once favourite song, 'Chloe's my myrtle and Jenny's my rose.' Wilkinson thought highly of him, calling him his pupil, speaking of him as about the age of 17, known only from having sung one season at Ranelagh, and pronounced him the possessor of 'a most unpromising pair of legs.' Suett proved 'of real importance' to Wilkinson; at the close of this engagement a further engagement for two years, with a penalty of \u00a3100 for forfeiture, was drawn up.
