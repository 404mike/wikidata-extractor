In 1848, with Joseph Mayer and Henry Clark Pidgeon, he established the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, of which he was a mainstay for many years. He began close social and statistical inquiries in some of the Liverpool parishes. During 1857 and 1858 he sent to The Times summaries of his previous year's work in his parish. In 1858 and 1859 he gave evidence before select committees of the House of Lords, first on  divine worship in populous places, and secondly on church rates."]}, {"page": "Henry Clarke Pidgeon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Clark Pidgeon"]}]}}
