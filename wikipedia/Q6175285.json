To be eligible, a player must be a British passport holder who was born in Gibraltar, or has Gibraltarian parents or grandparents, or has attended school for five years locally. Former Manchester United, Derby County, Southampton and Stoke City defender Danny Higginbotham, whose uncle Allen Bula was the team manager, was eligible to be called up because of this criteria adjustment. On 18 September 2013, Higginbotham announced that he agreed in \"principle\" to play for Gibraltar. Recruiting of English-born players by manager Allen Bula was unpopular with some fans, and in 2015 Bula's successor Jeff Wood said he would use more home-based players and develop local talent while still searching for eligible players elsewhere.", "On 29 March 2015, Gibraltar scored their first ever goal in a full international competitive match. Lee Casciaro scored against Scotland at Hampden Park, Glasgow during the first half to level the match at 1\u20131. However, Scotland went on to win 6\u20131. In July 2015, Englishman Jeff Wood was appointed manager, succeeding caretaker Dave Wilson who took over from Gibraltar's first manager Allen Bula in March 2015. Gibraltar could not repeat their performance of scoring a goal in the next two matches; losing 7\u20130 away against Germany and 4\u20130 against Republic of Ireland. On 7 September 2015, Jake Gosling scored Gibraltar's second-ever competitive goal; netting a late consolation goal as his team was defeated 8\u20131 by Poland. Gibraltar finished its maiden qualifying campaign last in its group with zero points. With a 0\u20136 defeat to Scotland in the final match of qualifying, Gibraltar allowed 56 total goals throughout qualification, surpassing San Marino's previous record of 53 in a 10-match qualification process."]}, {"page": "Jeff Wood", "response": ["Jeff Wood may refer to:", "* Jeff Wood (footballer) (born 1954), English former football goalkeeper", "* Jeff Wood (racing driver) (born 1957), former race car driver", "* Jeff Wood (singer) (born 1968), country music artist"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wood", "response": ["* Jeff Wood (disambiguation), several people", ":* Jeff Wood (footballer) (born 1954), English former football goalkeeper", ":* Jeff Wood (racing driver) (born 1957), former race car driver", ":* Jeff Wood (singer) (born 1968), country music artist"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Jeff Wood"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Jeff Wood||GK||||Islington||||0||0|| Charlton Athletic||Summer 1981||Undisclosed", "|Jeff Wood"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["The opening of the transfer window on 1 July saw Southport players Andy Parry and Shaun Whalley sign for undisclosed fees, and out-of-contract Histon duo Danny Fitzsimons and Jim Stevenson also join the club.
