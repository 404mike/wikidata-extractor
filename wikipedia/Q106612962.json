CIE (c.\u20091840 \u2013 12 May 1913) was a British surgeon and superintendent of the central prison in Agra, India, a position he held for 14 years. While superintendent he developed the prison as an important manufacturing centre for high-quality carpets. In 1886, he escorted 34 Indians, mostly prisoners, to the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886 in London, where their craftsmanship in weaving carpets was displayed. At Queen Victoria's request, he recruited the servant Abdul Karim, later known as \"the Munshi\", who served her for the last 14 years of her life. \nTyler was initially posted to the civil surgeoncy in the North-Western Provinces, before being appointed as superintendent of the prison at Meerut, and thereafter at Agra. He was knighted in 1888. In 2017, he was portrayed in the film Victoria & Abdul.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir James Reid, 1st Baronet", "response": ["As physician to the Queen, and at her instruction, Reid also attended to her \"Munshi\", Abdul Karim. In 1894, along with others, he protested against the role of Karim in Queen Victoria's life. On the question of the Karim's background, Reid noted in his diary that John W. Tyler, superintendent at the central jail in Agra, had informed him that he \"had constantly seen the Munshi's wife and female relations in India, as they were never shut up there from public gaze, belonging as they do to quite a low class; and that the idea of their being in purdah was never dreamt of until they came to England as ladies\". In later years, Reid would become the main communicator between the Royal Household and the Queen in matters relating to the Munshi.Basu, 2010, pp.59-60</Ref>"]}, {"page": "Sacred Heart Catholic Church (Mathura)", "response": ["It was built in the 1870s by Frederic Growse, a British civil servant and convert to Catholicism, on the site of a shed which had previously been used as a Catholic chapel.
