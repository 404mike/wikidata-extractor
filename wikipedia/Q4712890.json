He was the son of Peter Drummond-Burrell, 22nd Baron Willoughby de Eresby (died 1865), and Sarah Clementina, n\u00e9e Drummond (died 1865). He never married.\nOn his father's death in 1865, he succeeded him as Baron Willoughby de Eresby, Baron Gwydyr, Baronet Burrell of Knipp and joint (1/2) hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain. On his death the Willoughby barony fell into abeyance between his two sisters; the abeyance was later terminated in favour of the elder one, Clementina, who became the 24th Baroness. The joint hereditary Lord Great Chamberlainship was split equally between the two sisters, each holding one quarter. The Gwydyr barony was inherited by his cousin, Peter Burrell, who became the 4th Baron Gwydyr.\nHis tomb, alongside that of his nephew Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster (d. 1910), is to the rear of the Church of St Michael and All Angels at Edenham in Lincolnshire. Together, the tombs are Grade II listed.", "link_mentions": {}}}
