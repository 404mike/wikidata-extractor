First in was former Wales under-21 winger Nathan Craig.  Currently a free agent, Craig had impressed Ling while playing for the reserves and was offered what amounted to an extended trial until the end of the season. Another new face arrived in the shape of defender Angus MacDonald who was brought in on loan from Reading for the rest of the season. The new players had yet to make an appearance before Torquay's run of good form came to a shuddering halt with a surprise 2\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor to struggling Bradford City.  Fans may well have been wondering if they were feeling the delayed effects of the Manager of the Month 'curse' when the Gulls suffered a second successive loss away to Gillingham.  The 2\u20130 defeat at Priestfield ended in bizarre circumstances with the assistant referee flagging for a penalty when Brian Saah had seemingly brought down former Gulls-loanee Gavin Tomlin in the penalty box.  However, referee Jock Waugh (who had originally waved play-on) decided to send off Joe Oastler instead of Saah.  However, following an appeal, the FA rectified the error and the one-match ban was switched from Oastler to Saah.", "With a daunting eight fixtures scheduled for the month, Martin Ling endeavoured to strengthen the squad with the signing of Ryan Jarvis on loan from League One Walsall.  Jarvis had previously played under Ling at Leyton Orient but had recently failed to cement a regular place in the Saddlers' first team and so was allowed to the join the Gulls until the end of the season. Jarvis made his Torquay debut when he came on as a sub for the injured Danny Stevens in the month's first fixture, a tricky tie away to Crawley Town.  Also making his debut for the Gulls was Angus MacDonald who came in for the suspended Brian Saah.  The young defender gave an assured performance in his first ever League appearance to help Torquay gain a 1\u20130 victory over their promotion-chasing rivals.  It was a particularly satisfying result for the Torquay fans after August's humiliating 3\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor and the previous season's FA Cup exit.", "|21 ||  || DF || Angus MacDonald || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0", "|Angus MacDonald"]}, {"page": "Angus Macdonald (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Angus MacDonald (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["Several young players left the club on loan during the summer. Left back Joseph Mills became the first outgoing player, joining Burnley on a season long loan on 17 July, whilst two days later Gozie Ugwu, having just signed a new 2-year contract, was loaned to Yeovil Town until 1 January 2013. The following week Michael Hector joined League One team Shrewsbury Town until 2 January 2013 and on 30 July Angus MacDonald joined AFC Wimbledon on a six-month deal.

On the same day, the final game of the month took place at the Madejski Stadium with Reading earning a 2\u20132 draw against Newcastle United. Reading twice took the lead through Jimmy Kebe and Noel Hunt but a late Demba Ba goal was enough to secure Newcastle a share of the points. Despite suspicions of handball, Ba's goal was allowed to stand and Reading entered October in 19th position and still without a win in the league.", "In mid-November a series of loan returns and departures were completed. Firstly, on 20 November, goalkeeper Mikkel Andersen returned from Portsmouth having made 19 appearances during his three-month stay. He was followed the next day by Michael Hector who was recalled early from Shrewsbury Town having fallen out of first team contention. Within hours of being recalled Hector was on the move again, joining Aldershot Town until January whilst Angus MacDonald joined Torquay United on a similar deal. Lawson D'Ath extended his stay at Cheltenham Town and was joined at the club by Jake Taylor with both signing until the beginning of January. The loan business was completed by Simon Church who extended his stay at Huddersfield for a further five weeks.", "As well as the four permanent transfers, January saw several players return to, and leave the club on loan. On 1 January Gozie Ugwu returned from his spell at Yeovil Town, whilst Michael Hector extended his stay at Aldershot Town the following day, keeping him with the club until the end of the month. Young striker Dominic Samuel joined Colchester United on a one-month youth loan on 3 January with Karl Sheppard returning from his spell at Accrington Stanley the same day. The day after, Jake Taylor extended his loan with Cheltenham Town for another month, though Lawson D'Ath's deal with the Robins was not renewed and he returned to Reading having made three appearances. On 8 January Angus MacDonald's loan to Torquay United was extended until the end of the season and a week later Jon Henly returned after a one-month stay with Hungerford Town. Having returned from Yeovil two weeks earlier, Gozie Ugwu was on the move again, this time to Plymouth Argyle on a one-month youth loan on 17 January. A final flurry of activity began on 28 January when Jake Taylor was recalled from Cheltenham having started just one game since his loan was extended. The following day Michael Hector returned from Aldershot and was immediately loaned out again, swapping places with Taylor and joining Cheltenham for a month. The last day of the month saw two young players move out on loan. Jordan Obita joined Oldham Athletic for one month whilst Karl Sheppard rejoined his former club Shamrock Rovers until July 2013.
