In that year Edmund ravaged Strathclyde. According to the thirteenth-century chronicler Roger of Wendover, the invasion was supported by Hywel Dda, and Edmund had two sons of the king of Strathclyde blinded, perhaps to deprive their father of throneworthy heirs. Edmund then gave the kingdom to Malcolm I of Scotland in return for a pledge to defend it on land and on sea, a decision variously interpreted by historians. Dumville and the historian of Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards regard it as granting Strathclyde to the Scottish king in return for an acknowledgement of Edmund's overlordship, whereas Williams thinks it probably means that he agreed to Malcolm's overlordship of the area in return for an alliance against the Dublin Vikings, and Stenton and Miller see it as recognition by Edmund that Northumbria was the northern limit of Anglo-Saxon England."]}, {"page": "King Arthur", "response": ["This lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, \"at this stage of the enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [but ...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him\". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d", "response": ["Ceolwulf is not recorded after 879. His successor as the ruler of the English western half of Mercia, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's husband \u00c6thelred, is first seen in 881 when, according to the historian of medieval Wales, Thomas Charles-Edwards, he led an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of the north Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd. In 883 he made a grant with the consent of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship. In 886 Alfred occupied the Mercian town of London, which had been in Viking hands. He then received the submission of all English not under Viking control and handed control of London over to \u00c6thelred. In the 890s, \u00c6thelred and Edward, Alfred's son and future successor, fought off more Viking attacks. Alfred died in 899 and Edward's claim to the throne was disputed by \u00c6thelwold, son of Alfred's elder brother. \u00c6thelwold joined forces with the Vikings when he was unable to get sufficient support in Wessex, and his rebellion only ended with his death in battle in December 902."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelstan", "response": ["Whereas \u00c6thelstan was the first English king to achieve lordship over northern Britain, he inherited his authority over the Welsh kings from his father and aunt. In the 910s Gwent acknowledged the lordship of Wessex, and Deheubarth and Gwynedd accepted that of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d of Mercia; following Edward's takeover of Mercia, they transferred their allegiance to him. According to William of Malmesbury, after the meeting at Eamont \u00c6thelstan summoned the Welsh kings to Hereford, where he imposed a heavy annual tribute and fixed the border between England and Wales in the Hereford area at the River Wye.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 340\u2013341; Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, p. 163 The dominant figure in Wales was Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, described by the historian of early medieval Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards as \"the firmest ally of the 'emperors of Britain' among all the kings of his day\". Welsh kings attended \u00c6thelstan's court between 928 and 935 and witnessed charters at the head of the list of laity (apart from the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde), showing that their position was regarded as superior to that of the other great men present. The alliance produced peace between Wales and England, and within Wales, lasting throughout \u00c6thelstan's reign, though some Welsh resented the status of their rulers as under-kings, as well as the high level of tribute imposed upon them. In Armes Prydein Vawr (The Great Prophecy of Britain), a Welsh poet foresaw the day when the British would rise up against their Saxon oppressors and drive them into the sea.Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, pp. 497\u2013523", "According to William of Malmesbury, after the Hereford meeting \u00c6thelstan went on to expel the Cornish from Exeter, fortify its walls, and fix the Cornish boundary at the River Tamar. This account is regarded sceptically by historians, however, as Cornwall had been under English rule since the mid-ninth century. Thomas Charles-Edwards describes it as \"an improbable story\", while historian John Reuben Davies sees it as the suppression of a British revolt and the confinement of the Cornish beyond the Tamar. \u00c6thelstan emphasised his control by establishing a new Cornish see and appointing its first bishop, but Cornwall kept its own culture and language.Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, p. 432; Davies, \"Wales and West Britain\", pp.\u00a0342\u2013343; Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, p. 164; Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 341\u2013342"]}, {"page": "Aimend", "response": ["* Thomas Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland.

This was described by Welsh annals as \"revenge by God for Rhodri\". The defeat forced \u00c6thelred to abandon his ambitions in north Wales, but he continued to exercise overlordship over the south-eastern Welsh kingdoms of Glywysing and Gwent.Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, pp.\u00a0490\u2013491 According to Alfred's Welsh biographer Asser, \u00c6thelred's \"might and tyrannical behaviour\" forced these kingdoms to submit to the protection of King Alfred's lordship.Keynes and Lapidge, Alfred the Great, pp. 96, 262\u2013263, n. 183 By 883, \u00c6thelred had accepted Alfred's lordship.

The population was entirely rural and dispersed, with small ringforts the largest centres of human occupation. Some 40,000 of these are known, while there may have been as many as 50,000, and \"archaeologists are agreed that the vast bulk of them are the farm enclosures of the well-to-do of early medieval Ireland\". Souterrains, underground passages and chambers for hiding in or escaping through, are common. It is likely that raiding Great Britain for slaves and other loot gave an important boost to an otherwise almost entirely agricultural economy.
