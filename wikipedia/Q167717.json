Asquith. For Jenkins, Asquith ranked with Attlee as the embodiment of the moderate, liberal intelligence in politics that he most admired. Through Asquith's grandson, Mark Bonham Carter, Jenkins had access to Asquith's letters to his mistress, Venetia Stanley.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 236. Kenneth Rose, Michael Foot, Asa Briggs and John Grigg all favourably reviewed the book when it was published in October 1964.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 239. However, Violet Bonham Carter wrote a defence of her father in The Times against the few criticisms of Asquith in the book,Violet Bonham Carter, 'Asquith Revealed By Events', The Times (2 November 1964), p. 11. and Robert Rhodes James wrote in The Spectator that \"Asquith was surely a tougher, stronger, more acute man...than Mr. Jenkins would have us believe.

Asquith", "response": ["Above all else, Asquith thrived on company and conversation. A clubbable man, he enjoyed \"the companionship of clever and attractive women\" even more. Throughout his life, Asquith had a circle of close female friends, which Margot termed his \"harem\". In 1912, one of these, Venetia Stanley became much closer. Meeting first in 1909\u20131910, by 1912 she was Asquith's constant correspondent and companion. Between that point and 1915, he wrote her some 560 letters, at a rate of up to four a day. Although it remains uncertain whether or not they were lovers, she became of central importance to him. Asquith's thorough enjoyment of \"comfort and luxury\" during peacetime, and his unwillingness to adjust his behaviour during conflict, ultimately contributed to the impression of a man out of touch. Lady Tree's teasing question, asked at the height of the conflict, \"Tell me, Mr Asquith, do you take an interest in the war?\", conveyed a commonly held view.", "Failures in both the East and the West began a tide of events that was to overwhelm Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, \"As you know well, this breaks my heart. I couldn't bear to come and see you. I can only pray God to bless you\u2014and help me.\" Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a remark in a letter written in mid-1914: \"Keep close to me beloved in this most critical time of my life. I know you will not fail.\" Her engagement, \"a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me\", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith \"was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion.\""]}, {"page": "1948 in literature", "response": ["*August 3 \u2013 Venetia Stanley, English correspondent (cancer, born 1887)"]}, {"page": "Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet", "response": ["At the end of November and again in mid-December French told Wilson he was thinking of moving Murray to a corps command and insisting on Wilson replacing him, but Asquith, as he put it in a letter to Venetia Stanley (20 December), summoned French to London for \"a little talk\" and forbade him to promote \"that poisonous tho' clever ruffian Wilson who behaved \u2026 so badly \u2026 about Ulster\". Wilson claimed to have heard Joffre, on a visit to GHQ (27 December), complain that it was \"a pity\" that Murray had not been removed, but when he heard of this Asquith put it down to \"the constant intriguing of that serpent Wilson\" whom he and Kitchener were determined to block. Asquith felt he was too Francophile and too fond of \"mischief\" (political intrigue), but despite Wilson's advising French that the reasons for their objections were largely personal, he was not able to dissuade them from blocking the appointment. On a visit to London in early January Wilson heard from the King's assistant secretary Clive Wigram that it was Asquith rather than Kitchener who was blocking the promotion, which Carson and Law were eager for him to have."]}, {"page": "Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane", "response": ["To the detriment of their relationship, Asquith gave no personal expression to Haldane.

To the north lies the Rose garden, laid out by Lady Churchill and her cousin Venetia Stanley. The nearby Marlborough Pavilion was built by Tilden and decorated with frescos by Churchill's nephew, John Spencer Churchill in 1949.

H. Asquith outlined the sequence of events that might lead to a general war, but noted that there was no reason for Britain to become involved.: \"... the situation is just about as bad as it can possibly be. Austria has sent a bullying and humiliating ultimatum to Serbia, who cannot possibly comply with it, and demanded an answer within forty-eight hours-failing which she will march. This means, almost inevitably, that Russia will come to the scene in defence of Serbia and in defiance of Austria, and if so, it is difficult for Germany and France to refrain from lending a hand to one side or the other. So that we are in measurable, or imaginable, distance of a real Armageddon. Happily, there seems to be no reason why we should be anything more than spectators.\" The First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, wrote, \"Europe is trembling on the verge of a general war. The Austrian ultimatum to Serbia being the most insolent document of its kind ever devised\", but believed that Britain would stay neutral in the coming war. Grey suggested to the Austrian ambassador that the deadline for the ultimatum be extended as the best way of saving the peace. When Grey told his friend Lichnowsky that \"Any nation that accepted conditions like that would really cease to count as an independent nation\", Wilhelm wrote on the margin of Lichnowsky's report \"That would be very desirable. It is not a nation in the European sense, but a band of robbers!\"", "On 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian declaration of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: \"War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna.\" Asquith wrote in a letter to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that Russia was trying to entangle Britain in what he described as \"the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years\".: \"Russia is trying to drag us in. The news this morning is that Serbia had capitulated on the main points, but it is very doubtful if any reservations will be accepted by Austria, who is resolved upon a complete and final humiliation. The curious thing is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very bad case. But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make most people think that is a case of a big Power wantonly bullying a little one. Anyhow, it is the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years.\" To stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia."]}, {"page": "J.
