She agreed with Most's assessment of her image, saying that his influence, at which some of his artists such as Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart balked, did not extend to manufacture and that \"If he tried to build me into a Lulu, I wouldn't have it. I'd say 'go to hell' and walk out.\"  This was the height of the glam rock period of the 1970s and Quatro, who wore leather clothes, portrayed a wild androgynous image while playing music that \"hinged mostly on a hard rock chug beneath lyrics in which scansion overruled meaning.\""]}, {"page": "Tony Blackburn", "response": ["In 1972 he released a self named album on the RCA label.
