He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances. Wilcock's friend, Dave Murray, was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance. Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976, though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases."]}, {"page": "The Sweet", "response": ["Andy Scott and Mick Tucker organised their own version of Sweet with Paul Mario Day (ex-Iron Maiden, More, Wildfire) on lead vocals, Phil Lanzon (ex-Grand Prix) on keyboards and Mal McNulty on bass. The band performed at the Marquee Club in London in February 1986, with the shows recorded and gaining release a few years later, bolstered by four new studio tracks including a cover of the Motown standard \"Reach Out I'll Be There\". This line-up also toured Australian and New Zealand pubs and clubs for more than three months in 1985 and for a similar period again in 1986. Singer Paul Day ended up marrying the band's Australian tour guide and relocating downunder. He continued with Sweet commuting back and forth to Europe for the group's tours until this proved to be too cumbersome. He departed in late 1988. As McNulty moved into the front man spot, Jeff Brown came in to take over bass early in 1989. Lanzon too went back and forth between Sweet and Uriah Heep during 1986-1988 before Heep's schedule grew too busy. Malcolm Pearson and then Ian Gibbons (who had played with The Kinks and The Records) both filled in for Lanzon until Steve Mann (Liar, Lionheart, McAuley Schenker Group) arrived in December 1989."]}, {"page": "Iron Maiden (album)", "response": ["Although \"Strange World\" is credited solely to Harris, Paul Day, the band's original vocalist from 1975 to 1976, asserted that he also contributed to the song. \"Charlotte the Harlot\", their only song to have been written by Dave Murray alone, is the first of four Iron Maiden tracks about the fictional prostitute \"Charlotte\", although Murray states it was \"based on a true story\". The 7-minute \"Phantom of the Opera\" is one of Harris's favourites and is still performed live relatively frequently. With many mood and time-changes, Harris marks it as \"the first song I'd written that was a bit more proggy\". \"Transylvania\" is an instrumental piece composed by Harris, which was later covered by Iced Earth on the album Horror Show."]}, {"page": "List of Iron Maiden band members", "response": [";Paul Day", "*Paul Day \u2013 lead vocals"]}, {"page": "December 1975", "response": ["200px|thumb|right|December 25, 1975: Paul Day and Steve Harris create Iron Maiden", "*The British band Iron Maiden was formed by bass guitarist Steve Harris in Leyton, East London, who teamed up with vocalist Paul Day, drummer Ron Matthews, and guitarists Terry Rance and Dave Sullivan.\"Iron Men\", by Paul Sexton, Billboard magazine, May 17, 2008, p46; Neil Daniels, Iron Maiden: The Ultimate Illustrated History (Voyageur Press, 2012) p9"]}, {"page": "Paul Mario Day", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Day (musician)"]}, {"page": "Paul Day", "response": ["Paul Day may refer to:", "* Paul Day (musician) (born 1956), lead vocalist of Iron Maiden, 1975\u201376", "* Paul Day (sculptor) (born 1967), British sculptor", "* Paul Day (table tennis) (born 1958),table tennis player from England"]}]}}
