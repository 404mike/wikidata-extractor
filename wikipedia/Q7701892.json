His young son, Stephen, had a regular part in Doomwatch. Dudley also directed eight early episodes of All Creatures Great and Small, including the 1983 Christmas special.\nHe began an association with Doctor Who when he directed Meglos (1980) for John Nathan-Turner. That same year, he was asked to become producer of Blake's 7 after David Maloney was reassigned before it was known that a fourth season would be made. Dudley turned the offer down, as he no longer wished to work as a producer. The following year he embarked on a brief career as a screenwriter for Doctor Who. He wrote three scripts for the programme\u2014Four to Doomsday (1982), Black Orchid (1982) and The King's Demons (1983). He novelised the latter two stories for Target Books.
