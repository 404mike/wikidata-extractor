Just before half time, England led 21\u20130 through tries from Andrew Harriman, Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber, all converted by Nick Beal. Michael Lynagh scored a try before half time, but failed to convert his own try. In the second half Australia hit back strongly and first David Campese and then Semi Taupeaafe scored further tries, the latter also converted by Michael Lynagh. However, time ran out on the Australians and it was England captain \"Prince\" Andrew Harriman who was presented with the Melrose Cup by the Princess Royal.  Adedayo Adebayo, a member of that victorious side later recalled how surprising the victory had been to the players involved in it. He said \"We were basically a scratch side. We got together for the first time as a team the week before, played one practice match and went on to win! But there were a lot of quality players in that side and looking back that's why we were able to wing it slightly \u2013 the talent came through. Looking back though we had no expectations of winning at the start. We didn't know how far we would go. It just happened.\""]}, {"page": "Nigeria national rugby union team", "response": ["*Andrew Harriman - England"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1129||Andrew Harriman||wing ||1988-11-05||v Australia at Twickenham"]}, {"page": "Andy Harriman", "response": ["#redirect Andrew Harriman"]}, {"page": "Rugby union in Nigeria", "response": ["* Andrew Harriman"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 John Player Cup", "response": ["| ||14|| Andrew Harriman"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Pilkington Cup", "response": ["| ||14|| Andrew Harriman"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Pilkington Cup", "response": ["| ||19|| Andrew Harriman"]}, {"page": "1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens squads", "response": ["# Andrew Harriman (c)"]}, {"page": "Harriman, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Harriman"]}]}}
