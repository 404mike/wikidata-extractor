Turberfield's research is largely based on DNA nanostructures and photonic crystals, and his work on both nanomachines and photonic crystals has been highly cited.

The first DNA nanomachine\u2014a motif that changes its structure in response to an input\u2014was demonstrated in 1999 by Seeman.  An improved system, which was the first nucleic acid device to make use of toehold-mediated strand displacement, was demonstrated by Bernard Yurke the following year. The next advance was to translate this into mechanical motion, and in 2004 and 2005, several DNA walker systems were demonstrated by the groups of Seeman, Niles Pierce, Andrew Turberfield, and Chengde Mao.DNA machines:   The idea of using DNA arrays to template the assembly of other molecules such as nanoparticles and proteins, first suggested by Bruche Robinson and Seeman in 1987,Nanoarchitecture:  was demonstrated in 2002 by Seeman, Kiehl et al.Nanoarchitecture:  and subsequently by many other groups."]}, {"page": "International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering", "response": ["|Andrew Turberfield"]}, {"page": "British Biophysical Society", "response": ["In 2017, BBS and the Biological Physics Group of the Institute of Physics, jointly organized the IUPAB/EBSA/BBS/IoP Biophysics Congress in Edinburgh, with Tony Watts as Chair and Andrew Turberfield as co-chair of the congress."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (A)", "response": ["*Andrew Turberfield"]}, {"page": "Turberfield, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Turberfield"]}]}}
