He was the son of the Oxford University and Gloucestershire cricketer Herbert Page. He was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire and died at Cirencester, also in Gloucestershire.\nPage was a right-handed middle order batsman and a brilliant cover fieldsman, and played fairly regularly for Gloucestershire in County Championship matches in 1934, having made his debut the previous year. When the successful Bev Lyon stood down from the captaincy after six seasons at the end of 1934, Page, as the only regular amateur player in the side, was picked to succeed him for 1935.\nPage's first season as captain was not a success, and Wisden put some of the responsibility for a drop to 15th in the Championship on Page's inexperienced handling of a bowling attack that was in transition following the retirement of Charlie Parker. In 1936, however, Gloucestershire's rise to fourth in the final table was also due in part, Wisden said, to Page's enthusiasm and team-building.\nPage himself was a modest performer, with a career average of less than 20. He scored 1,000 runs in a season once only, in 1935, and made only one century.He was killed in a car crash near his home at Cirencester while returning from the final match of the 1936 season, where he had led his side to victory over Nottinghamshire at the Wagon Works Ground, Gloucester, and had taken the catch that finished the match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["As the 1936 season began, Hammond remained weak from the recent removal of his tonsils. Returning to cricket too soon, he was in poor form; he took a longer rest, which caused him to miss the first of three Tests against India. It was July before he felt fully well.Howat, p. 68. In all first-class cricket that season, Hammond scored 2,107 runs, averaging 56.94, and took 41 wickets. In county cricket, Gloucestershire appointed a new captain, Dallas Page. Hammond had been offered the joint captaincy with Bev Lyon, conditional on his becoming assistant secretary at the club to enable him to play as an amateur, but declined for financial reasons.Howat, pp. 67\u201368. Hammond returned to the England side for the second Test, making 167, his first century in 28 innings, scoring quickly throughout. He was praised by Wisden for his control. Hammond continued to score heavily in the third Test, making 217 after being dropped twice early on. His highest score came in the last county match of the season, at Gloucestershire, which was Tom Goddard's benefit match. A difficult pitch meant that wickets tumbled on the first day, prompting fears of an early finish which would possibly lose money for Goddard. Hammond batted all of the second day, ensuring the match lasted the full three days, to score 317 out of a total of 485.Foot, pp. 99\u2013100."]}, {"page": "Diamond Dallas Page", "response": ["Dallas Page (born Page Joseph Falkinburg, April 5, 1956), better known by his ring name Diamond Dallas Page (often stylized as DDP), is an American retired professional wrestler, fitness instructor, motivational speaker, and actor. In the course of his wrestling career, which spanned two decades, Page has wrestled for mainstream wrestling promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and All Elite Wrestling (AEW).", "He attended St. Joseph's High School (now Donovan Catholic High School) in Toms River, New Jersey for his freshman and second years, spending his first season on the JV basketball team and making the varsity squad as a sophomore.Davies, Ross.

After his injury had healed, Falkinburg returned to WCW television in 1994, with his wife Kimberly as the Diamond Doll, and an on-screen bodyguard, Max Muscle. He held open arm wrestling challenges to win Kimberly, but Max always helped him win or arm wrestled for him. He was also involved in an angle where he was said to have supposedly amassed the sum of 13 million dollars through victories in arm wrestling competitions, a fortune that he would later lose. He also had a long feud with Dave Sullivan because Sullivan gave Kimberly gifts (and largely because Falkinburg was defeated by Sullivan in one of the arm wrestling contests, which earned him a date with Kimberly). At Fall Brawl, Falkinburg won his first championship when he defeated Renegade for the WCW World Television Championship. In the build-up to his first title defense at Halloween Havoc, there was growing dissension between Falkinburg and Kimberly. Johnny B. Badd defeated Falkinburg for the TV title and again at World War 3 on November 26, winning Kimberly's freedom from DDP. At Uncensored on March 24, 1996 The Booty Man with Kimberly as The Booty Babe defeated Diamond Dallas Page in a Loser Leaves Town match.", "Falkinburg returned on the May 18, 1996, episode of WCW Saturday Night as a tweener defeating Billy Kidman. On May 19, Falkinburg participated in the Lord of the Ring Tournament (Battle Bowl) at Slamboree. Falkinburg was victorious when he defeated The Barbarian with two Diamond Cutters. The winner was to be the number one contender for the World Title which at that time was held by The Giant. However, he never received the title shot that he earned that night. Page was feuding with Eddie Guerrero when the New World Order (nWo) was formed. Since Nash and Hall were both former partners of Page, they assisted him in his matches in the tournament being held for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship. Believing their assistance was not appreciated, however, Hall and Nash attacked him during the tournament finals, therefore handing the belt to Guerrero. After demonstrating the benefits of the nWo, they asked him to join. He responded by giving them Diamond Cutters on January 25, 1997 at Souled Out, starting a face turn and a feud with the nWo. Soon after, Page began a feud with recent nWo recruit \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage. On an episode of Nitro, Savage, aided by Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, attacked Page and spray-painted \"nWo\" on his back. A few weeks later at Uncensored, Savage and Miss Elizabeth \"broke\" (a worked shoot) by revealing to the world that Page and Kimberly were, in fact, married. Savage then proceeded to beat up Page, ensuring a future match between the two. At Spring Stampede, in Page's first pay-per-view main event, he and Savage battled in a match where Page emerged victorious, but it was not the end of conflict between the two. A few months later at The Great American Bash, they squared off again in an anything goes, lights out match. The match ended with Savage defeating Page with help from (then) Tag Team Champion Scott Hall. At Bash at the Beach, Scott Hall and Randy Savage defeated Diamond Dallas Page and Curt Hennig. Curt Hennig, who Diamond Dallas Page had recruited personally to join WCW and team with him, turned on DDP during the match. Hennig defeated Diamond Dallas Page in a grudge match at Road Wild. At Fall Brawl, Page teamed with Lex Luger to defeat Scott Hall and Randy Savage in a No Disqualification match. Page even dressed up as masked wrestler La Parka and beat Savage on the July 7 edition of Monday Nitro. Around this time, Page also started fighting nWo leader, Hollywood Hogan. Page and Savage battled for the last time at Halloween Havoc. The match was billed as a Las Vegas sudden-death match, where Savage pinned Page after Hogan, dressed as Sting, came out and hit Page with a baseball bat in his already \"injured\" midsection, resulting in Savage picking up the win. On an episode of Nitro shortly after Halloween Havoc, Page fought Hogan, but was again beaten down by the nWo.", "Shortly after Slamboree, Page entered into an alliance with fellow New Jerseyan Bam Bam Bigelow and won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from then champions Perry Saturn and Raven on May 31, thanks to Chris Kanyon turning heel on former ally Raven and costing the team the championships. Page, Bigelow, and Kanyon became known as the Jersey Triad and through their alliance with WCW \"President for Life\" Ric Flair took advantage of the Freebird Rule in their subsequent matches (meaning any combination of the three could defend the championship). The Triad held the titles until June 10, when Saturn and Chris Benoit (now stablemates in The Revolution) took the title from them. They regained the belts at The Great American Bash three days later, and lost them to Harlem Heat at Road Wild in August. Later that night, Chris Benoit defeated Diamond Dallas Page to retain the United States title. The group broke up shortly thereafter and Page began feuding with Hogan again, joining Sid Vicious and Rick Steiner in a team effort to take on Hogan, Sting, and Goldberg. Soon after that feud ended Page turned into a hero again and feuded with both Kanyon and Bigelow before the year ended.", "On August 9, 2009, Diamond Dallas Page made a special appearance for Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW) at their Bloodymania III event, aligning himself with the jWo.
