As the land was already deeded to others, however, the Bouligny heirs were entitled to claim  of public lands elsewhere in the country at a price of $1.25 per acre. The following year, the 40th Congress passed a joint resolution suspending the act. When Mary Elizabeth, now married to George Levey, sought to claim the promised land in 1888, her petition was rejected by the Department of the Interior, a decision that was a year later affirmed by the Supreme Court. During the 1876 presidential election, the Democratic Party noted that Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes's only speech before the House as a member of Congress was in support of revoking the act."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Normanby (Victoria)", "response": ["|| George Levey"]}, {"page": "George Collins Levey", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Levey"]}, {"page": "Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition", "response": ["A London Committee was formed under Chairman the Duke of Manchester, while secretary George Levey contributed largely to the Melbourne, London, Philadelphia, New York and Paris press, and wrote various important official reports."]}, {"page": "Levey, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Levey"]}]}}
