He did not take an interest in music until he was nine years old. At the time, Jenkins was a member of a choir which was to compete in a local Eisteddfod.At age sixteen, his musical interest deepened and Jenkins began serious study of the Tonic-Solfa system.  Two years later, he received an advanced certificate from the Tonic-Solfa college and began conducting his own choir. At age 20, Jenkins and his choir won a competition at Llanddeusant.  He next turned his attention to the study of composition, harmony and counterpoint and was awarded a prize for the best anthem from the Tonic-Solfa college.In 1874, he began studying music at Aberystwyth.  By his second term, he had been awarded a three-year scholarship and became an assistant to Joseph Parry. Jenkins continued participating in various Eisteddfodau at home and abroad.  He had won a prize at the Utica, New York Eistoddfod in 1873 and won a national prize at Pwllheli in 1875. Jenkins also continued composing and studying music.  He was awarded the top prize in composing for his cantata Arch y Cyfamod at Carnarvon in 1876; the next year, Jenkins received a Bachelor of Music degree from Cambridge University.Jenkins spent four months touring the United States in 1885; during that time he served as a conductor and as a judge at the various singing festivals.  In 1893 he returned to Aberystwyth as a lecturer. Jenkins continued composing while at the university; composing an oratorio, Dewi Sant (Saint David), for the 1894 Eisteddfod at Carnarvon, and a cantata, The Psalm of Life for the 1895 Cardiff Triennial Festival.  This work was performed by 2,000 voices at  the Crystal Palace, London in the same year.He continued his activities conducting choirs and serving as a judge at various Eisteddfodau; Jenkins also became a co-editor of the music journal Y Cerddor, sharing the duties with Emlyn Evans. He rose to Professor at Aberystwyth in 1910; retaining this position until his death in 1915.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Jenkins", "response": ["David Jenkins may refer to:", "* David Jenkins (composer) (1848\u20131915), Welsh composer", "* David Jenkins (musician) (born 1947), singer for the band Pablo Cruise", "* David Jenkins (television writer), creator of People of Earth", "* David Jenkins, set designer", "* David Jenkins (North Carolina), 18th Century North Carolina politician", "* David Jenkins (Georgia politician), American politician from Georgia", "* David Jenkins (bishop) (1925\u20132016), of Durham", "* David Jenkins (Archdeacon of Westmorland and Furness) (1929\u20132014), Anglican priest", "* David Jenkins (archdeacon of Sudbury) (born 1961), Anglican priest", "* David Jenkins (rugby, born 1904) (1904\u20131951), rugby union and rugby league footballer for Wales", "* David Jenkins (rugby, born 1914) (1914\u20131979), rugby union and rugby league footballer for Cardiff ", "* David Jenkins (figure skater) (born 1936), American figure skater", "* David Jenkins (footballer) (born 1946), English footballer for Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur", "* David Jenkins (sprinter) (born 1952), Scottish athlete", "* David Jenkins (Olympic diving coach) (1989-2021), Team Great Britain Olympic diving coach", "* David Jenkins (Royalist) (1582\u20131663), Welsh judge and Royalist during the English Civil War", "* David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins (1899\u20131969), British Law Lord", "* David Jenkins (librarian) (1912\u20132002), Welsh librarian", "* David Jenkins (British Army officer), British Army major general", "* David Jenkins, journalist and editor of GameCentral"]}, {"page": "1915 in music", "response": ["*December 10 \u2013 David Jenkins, Welsh choral composer (b. 1848)"]}, {"page": "1848 in music", "response": ["**David Jenkins, composer (died 1915)"]}, {"page": "Music of Wales", "response": ["Although choral music in the 19th century by Welsh composers was mainly religious, there was a steady body of secular songs being produced. Composers such as Joseph Parry, whose work Myfanwy is still a favourite Welsh song, were followed by David Jenkins and D. Emlyn Evans, who tailored songs specifically for the Victorian music market.Davies (2008), pg 581. These secular hymns were embraced by the emerging male voice choirs, which formed originally as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, but also sang outside the church in a form of recreation and fellowship.Davies (2008), pg 532. The industrial workforce attracted less of a jollity of English glee clubs and also avoided the more robust militaristic style of music. Composers such as Charles Gounod were imitated by Welsh contemporaries such as Parry, Protheroe and Price to cater for a Welsh fondness of dramatic narratives, wide dynamic contrasts and thrilling climaxes. As well as the growth of male voice choirs during the industrial period, Wales also experienced an increase in the popularity of brass bands. The bands were popular among the working classes, and were adopted by paternalistic employers who saw brass bands as a constructive activity for their work forces.Davies (2008), pg 79. Solo artists of note during the nineteenth century included charismatic singers Robert Rees (Eos Morlais) and Sarah Edith Wynne, who would tour outside Wales and helped build the country's reputation as a \"land of song\".Davies (2008) p.445Davies (2008) p.734"]}, {"page": "Joseph Parry", "response": ["David Jenkins, who was a student and assistant to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic to be a good conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music.

When these funds ran low, Rees was faced with the possibility of leaving the university until David Jenkins arranged for him to teach Solfa classes in Pen-y-garn.
