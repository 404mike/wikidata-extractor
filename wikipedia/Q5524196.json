In his first full season as manager, Lloyd won immediate promotion back to the Second Division with a runners-up finish, largely thanks to 32-goal forward Garry Nelson. Two successful battles against relegation followed, before Lloyd guided the club to the 1991 Second Division play-off Final, which was lost 3\u20131 to Notts County.
