Holgate pushed Firmino into the advertising boards, which was followed by the pair exchanging words, with Firmino seemingly insulting the player. Following the match, Holgate accused Firmino of racially abusing him, which he denied. A day later, the Football Association opened an investigation on the matter. Nearly two months later, after they had took statements from 12 different players, several referees and consulted two Portuguese lip-readers, the Football Association cleared Firmino of any offence as a result of \"insufficient evidence\"."]}, {"page": "Jed Steer", "response": ["Jed Steer was recalled to cover for Villa's new signing Lovre Kalini\u0107 after Orjan Nyland was injured, but following an injury to Kalinic during a match against West Brom, Steer was subbed on at halftime. He then started the following match against Stoke City, and his impressive performance meant that he continued to play the next match against Derby, despite Kalinic returning from injury, before retaining his place in Villa's following match, the Second City Derby against Birmingham City. Steer's good performances continued, and he quickly became first-choice keeper for Dean Smith, which saw Steer become part of a record-breaking ten-league-game winning streak for Aston Villa. Steer starred in Aston Villa's Championship play-offs semi-final win against West Bromwich Albion, saving two penalties from Mason Holgate and Ahmed Hegazi in a 4\u20133 shoot-out win to help send Aston Villa to the play-off finals for a second consecutive year."]}, {"page": "List of Nike sponsorships", "response": ["*  Mason Holgate"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["| 13 August 2015 || RB ||  || Mason Holgate || Everton || \u00a32,000,000 || "]}, {"page": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "response": ["Following his World Cup performance, BBC Sport expected Calvert-Lewin to make a first team breakthrough ahead of the 2017\u201318 season.
