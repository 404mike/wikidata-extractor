Born in Prescot, Merseyside, Whalley played for Norwich City and Southport as a youth before making his Football League debut with Chester City in 2004.\nAfter leaving Chester, he spent time in non-League football with Runcorn F.C. Halton and Witton Albion. While on the books at Witton, he spent five weeks on trial with Football League One side Crewe Alexandra but was not offered a contract, so he signed for League Two side Accrington Stanley in 2006. Whalley spent almost two years with the Lancashire club, but following his release in the summer of 2008, he returned to non-League, initially with Wrexham. While at Wrexham, he had a short loan spell with Southport where he helped the team to the Conference North play-offs. He subsequently played at Droylsden, where he was part of the team that won the Manchester Premier Cup in 2010, and Hyde before joining Southport again on a permanent basis in January 2011. He was signed by Luton Town in the summer of 2013 for an undisclosed fee, and joined AFC Telford United on loan in 2014. Both Luton and Telford won their respective leagues during the 2013\u201314 season, making Whalley a winner of both the Conference Premier and the Conference North in the same season. He left Luton in May 2015, later joining Shrewsbury.\nDescribed as an \"express-train down the wings\" by former teammate Paul Mullin, Whalley was called up to the Football Association XI standby squad for a game against Hallam, the game taking place to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the club. He is the son of the former Preston North End captain Neil Whalley, who was also a midfielder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Rush", "response": ["But after Rush ruled himself out of the running for the vacant Welsh manager's job on 1 November 2004 things never seemed to go as well. Several heavy defeats were inflicted and Rush was criticised for long-ball tactics  his managerial team opted to use. Despite pressure from chairman Stephen Vaughan, Rush refused to resign after a humiliating 5\u20130 loss to neighbours Shrewsbury Town in February 2005. But when Vaughan sacked Rush's assistant Mark Aizlewood in April, after a 1\u20130 defeat at Darlington, without his knowledge, Rush resigned on principle. By the point of his resignation, Chester were virtually safe from relegation. His spell in charge saw youngsters such as Robbie Booth, Michael Walsh and Shaun Whalley all given their Football League debuts, while players including Michael Brown, George Elokobi and Robbie Foy all spent time on loan at the club."]}, {"page": "Southport F.C.", "response": ["| Shaun Whalley", "*Shaun Whalley\u00a0\u2013 Shrewsbury Town"]}, {"page": "Sam Ricketts", "response": ["In the summer of 2019, Ricketts made more notable signings to strengthen the squad for the upcoming 2019\u201320 season, bringing in players such as Jason Cummings from Nottingham Forest, Sean Goss from Queens Park Rangers, Donald Love from Sunderland, Ethan Ebanks-Landell from Wolves and Aaron Pierre from Northampton Town. Ricketts started the season with a 1\u20130 win at home to Portsmouth on 4 August, with loanee Ryan Giles scoring the goal. During the 2019\u201320 season, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup for the second time during his management spell, defeating Bradford City, Mansfield Town and Bristol City along the way. The fourth round would see Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side host Premier League leaders and European and World champions Liverpool, where Shrewsbury came from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 with 2 goals from substitute Jason Cummings, forcing a replay at Anfield. In the replay, Shrewsbury fell short after a Shaun Whalley goal was disallowed by VAR for offside and an own goal from Ro-Shaun Williams saw the hosts win 1\u20130. This cup run brought repercussions, however, as Ricketts and the club went 10 league games without a win between December 2019 and February 2020. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Accrington Stanley on 11 February 2020 followed by another 2\u20130 defeat away at Portsmouth on 15 February put Ricketts' job under severe pressure. The winless run ended a week later on 22 February after a 1\u20130 win at home to Doncaster Rovers. On 14 March 2020, Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side were scheduled to take on top-of-the-table Coventry City at St Andrew's, however the match was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, the 2019\u201320 League One season was cut short and it was decided that final league positions would be based on a points-per-game basis. This saw the club finish 15th in the final table."]}, {"page": "Luke Foster", "response": ["During the 2008\u201309 season, Foster continued to play regularly at centre-back for Oxford,. In Oxford's match against Wrexham on 21 August 2008, Foster was sent off after just 11 minutes for \"denying Wrexham's Shaun Whalley a clear goalscoring opportunity\". As a result, he missed the next two games, returning to the first-team against Ebbsfleet United on 30 August 2008, but was once again sent off, this time for a foul on Craig Stone. Consequently, Foster did not play again in the first-team for a month. He regained his place in Oxford's defence, and played regularly until the end of the season. He scored his only goal of the season in a 2\u20131 victory over Lewes in February 2009. Foster made 44 appearances for the club during the season, scoring one goal, as Oxford narrowly missed out on a place in the Conference Premier play-offs. The following campaign, Foster was again a regular under manager Chris Wilder, appearing in all of Oxford's games up until December 2009. He scored his first goal of the season in Oxford's 1\u20131 draw against Barrow on 3 October 2009. Foster was sent off in a 1\u20131 draw against Barrow in the FA Cup on 28 November 2009, resulting in Barrow being awarded a penalty kick and subsequently scoring. In January 2010, Wilder stated that Oxford would not be extending Foster's contract in the summer, with Foster \"wanting that option to pursue offers from other clubs\"."]}, {"page": "Steve Halford", "response": ["After his release from Droylsden in September 2010 he signed for their local rivals Hyde United on 1 October 2010.
