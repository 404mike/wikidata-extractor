He wrote over 800 poems, some in Dorset dialect, and much other work, including a comprehensive English grammar quoting from more than 70 different languages. A linguistic purist, Barnes strongly advocated against borrowing foreign words into English, and instead supported the use and proliferation of \"strong old Anglo-Saxon speech\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*William Barnes (1801\u20131886, E)"]}, {"page": "Wessex", "response": ["Thomas Hardy used a fictionalized Wessex as a setting for many of his novels, adopting his friend William Barnes' term Wessex for their home county of Dorset and its neighboring counties in the south and west of England.

Over half the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport near Bournemouth. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to the Great Dorset Steam Fair, one of the biggest events of its kind in Europe. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.", "Dorset is famed in literature for being the native county of author and poet Thomas Hardy, and many of the places he describes in his novels in the fictional Wessex are in Dorset, which he renamed South Wessex.Blamires (pp. 112\u2013114) The National Trust owns Thomas Hardy's Cottage, in Higher Bockhampton, east of Dorchester; and Max Gate, his former house in Dorchester.

Powys lived in Chaldon Herring for over 20 years and used it as inspiration for the fictitious village of Folly Down in his novel Mr. Weston's Good Wine;Blamires (p. 225) John Cowper Powys, his elder brother, also set a number of his works in Dorset, such as the novels Maiden Castle and Weymouth Sands. Children's author Enid Blyton drew inspiration for many of her works from Dorset. The 19th-century poet William Barnes was born in Bagber and wrote many poems in his native Dorset dialect.

Moule remained a close friend of Hardy's for the rest of his life, and introduced him to new scientific findings that cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible, such as those of Gideon Mantell. Moule gave Hardy a copy of Mantell's book The Wonders of Geology (1848) in 1858, and Adelene Buckland has suggested that there are \"compelling similarities\" between the \"cliffhanger\" section from A Pair of Blue Eyes and Mantell's geological descriptions.

In its mildest form, purism stipulates the use of native terms instead of loanwords. In stronger forms, new words are coined from Germanic roots (such as wordstock for vocabulary) or revived from older stages of English (such as shrithe for proceed). Noted purists of Early Modern English include John Cheke, Thomas Wilson, Ralph Lever, Richard Rowlands, and Nathaniel Fairfax. Modern linguistic purists include William Barnes, Charles Dickens, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Elias Molee, Percy Grainger, and George Orwell.", "Linguistic purism saw renewed interest in the 19th century; American statesman Thomas Jefferson observed in an 1825 letter that \"a taste is reviving in England for the recovery of the Anglo-Saxon dialect\". Dorset poet, minister, and philologist William Barnes coined several words to promote \"strong old Anglo-Saxon speech\", including speechcraft for grammar, birdlore for ornithology, and bendsome for flexible. Poet Gerard Manley Hopkins discussed Barnes in an 1882 letter to Robert Bridges, lamenting the \"utter hopelessness\" of Barnes's purism but nonetheless writing in support of it, claiming that \"no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity\". Charles Dickens emphasized the importance of Germanic elements of English during this period, stressing that a writer should not \"seek abroad\" for new words. ", "Paul Jennings coined the term \"Anglish\" in a three-part series in Punch commemorating the 900th anniversary of the Norman conquest of England. Jennings's articles, entitled \"1066 and All Saxon\" and published in June 1966, envisioned an England in which the conquest had failed and included linguistically pure English passages; Jennings gave \"a bow to William Barnes\" as an inspiration. In 1989, science fiction writer Poul Anderson released a similarly-written text about basic atomic theory called Uncleftish Beholding composed almost fully of Germanic-rooted words. In 1997, Douglas Hofstadter jokingly entitled the style \"Ander-Saxon\"."]}, {"page": "Octavius Pickard-Cambridge", "response": ["Pickard-Cambridge was born in Bloxworth rectory, Dorset, the fifth son of Revd George Pickard, rector and squire of Bloxworth: the family changed its name to Pickard-Cambridge in 1848.

Unlike this one, some of Barnes's coinages caught on, such as foreword, Barnes's replacement for the preface of a book. Later, Poul Anderson wrote a jocular piece called Uncleftish Beholding in a constructed language based on English which others have called \"Ander-Saxon\"; this attempted to create a pure English vocabulary for nuclear physics.
