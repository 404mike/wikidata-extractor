Becoming, after his early death, one of the most influential British artists of his time, the facility of his style was inspired by the old masters, yet was entirely modern in its application. His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical cabinet paintings in a freely-handled version of the troubadour style.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History painting", "response": ["Romantic artists such as G\u00e9ricault and Delacroix, and those from other movements such as the English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood continued to regard history painting as the ideal for their most ambitious works.

The style troubadour (\"troubadour style\") was a somewhat derisive French term for earlier paintings of medieval and Renaissance scenes, which were often small and depicting moments of anecdote rather than drama; Ingres, Richard Parkes Bonington and  Henri Fradelle painted such works. Sir Roy Strong calls this type of work the \"Intimate Romantic\", and in French it was known as the \"peinture de genre historique\" or \"peinture anecdotique\" (\"historical genre painting\" or \"anecdotal painting\").Strong, 36-40; Wright, 269-273, French terms on p. 269"]}, {"page": "Normandy", "response": ["Romanticism drew painters to the Channel coasts of Normandy.

The lives of great artists such as Raphael were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted.
