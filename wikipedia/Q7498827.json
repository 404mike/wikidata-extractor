She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1991 by John Major after delivering victory in Westminster for the Conservatives in the 1990 elections, but was stripped of this title in 2003. \nWhile leader of Westminster City Council, Porter oversaw the \"Building Stable Communities\" policy \u2014 later described as the \"homes for votes scandal\" \u2014 and was consequently accused of gerrymandering. The policy was judged illegal by the district auditor, and a surcharge of \u00a327m levied on her in 1996. This was later raised to \u00a342 million with interest and costs. She eventually settled in 2004, paying a final settlement of \u00a312.3 million.Porter moved to Herzliya Pituah, Israel in 1994 during the inquiry, and returned to London in 2006.

Aristocratic properties appeared during the late 18th century, including Breadalbane House, Somerset House, and Londonderry House. The road grew in popularity during the 19th century after improvements to Hyde Park Corner and more affordable views of the park, which attracted the nouveau riche to the street and led to it becoming one of the most fashionable roads to live on in London. Notable residents included the 1st Duke of Westminster's residence at Grosvenor House, the Dukes of Somerset at Somerset House, and the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli at No.\u00a093. Other historic properties include Dorchester House, Brook House and Dudley House. In the 20th century, Park Lane became well known for its luxury hotels, particularly The Dorchester, completed in 1931, which became closely associated with eminent writers and international film stars. Flats and shops began appearing on the road, including penthouse flats. Several buildings suffered damage during World War II, yet the road still attracted significant development, including the Park Lane Hotel and the London Hilton on Park Lane, and several sports car garages. A number of properties on the road today are owned by some of the wealthiest businessmen from the Middle East and Asia. Current residents include business mogul Mohamed Al-Fayed and former council leader and Lord Mayor Dame Shirley Porter.", "Property prices on Park Lane remain some of the highest in London.
