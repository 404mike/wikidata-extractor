Manager Arthur Shallcross moved Watkin to inside-left where he developed into a tricky linkman between McColl and Harry Crossthwaite. Watkin still retained his eye for goal, top scoring with 16. Of his hat tricks early on against Nottingham Forest the Sentinel's Nimrod wrote: \"Stoke followers have waited patiently for a glimpse of the real Watkin and they were rewarded by an exhibition which very few forwards can surpass. How the mind went back to season 1914\u201315, when he struck terror to the hearts of opposing defenders.\" But dreams of promotion faded and Watkin's goals tailed off and Stoke were almost relegated. By this time Watkin had developed a reputation for either scoring two or three in a game or being anonymous. Some reporters believed that his experiences in the army had given him a nervous temperament. Watkin also had problems combining football with his job as a pottery department manager at Grimwade's. Once Stoke were relegated his company pressured him into quitting Stoke and he duly spent a season with Congleton Town. New Stoke manager Tom Mather brought him back for a short spell in 1924. Watkin worked as a full-time manager at the pot bank until retirement and he died on 27 August 1972."]}, {"page": "1919\u201320 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Harry Crossthwaite"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Harry Crossthwaite"]}]}}
