Warren Christie portrayed the character disguised as Bruce Wayne. Kevin Conroy voices the character in the Batman: Arkham video game series.", "* Tommy Elliot / Hush appears in Batwoman, primarily portrayed by Gabriel Mann and by Warren Christie while he posed as Bruce Wayne. Debuting in the episode \"Down Down Down\", this version retains his childhood friendship with Bruce Wayne, but is depicted as a real estate mogul with a grudge against Wayne Enterprises. He later reveals to Bruce's cousin Kate Kane that he learned Bruce's identity as Batman and intends to seek revenge via a rail gun stolen from Wayne Enterprises. After redesigning her Bat-suit, Kane becomes Batwoman to foil Elliot's plans, though the latter is knocked out by Alice after the former breaks off to save civilians. Elliot is subsequently arrested and taken to Arkham Asylum. In \"A Narrow Escape\", Elliot attacks Dr. Butler's therapy session, but Alice provokes him into attacking her to acquire a shank, which leads to Elliot being placed in solitary confinement. Concurrently, Batwoman and Luke Fox discover Elliot hired an accomplice to steal Lucius Fox's journal, which led to the latter's accidental death. In \"If You Believe in Me, I'll Believe in You\", Alice and her partner Mouse disguised as Dr. Butler visit Elliot and cut a deal with him to obtain Lucius' journal in exchange for disguising him as anyone he wants. Once they facilitate his escape from Arkham, they remove his face, but leave it wrapped in bandages until they can properly translate the journal, which is written in a code created specifically by Lucius. Once the journal's code has been cracked, Alice gives Elliot Bruce Wayne's face. In the second season premiere, \"Whatever Happened to Kate Kane?\", Elliot infiltrates the Batcave and steals Kryptonite, believing it can penetrate the Batsuit. However, Luke and Julia Pennyworth quickly discover his identity. Elliot attempts to escape, but encounters the new Batwoman. In the ensuing fight, his Kryptonite fails to work, and he is defeated and sent back to Arkham. In contrast to Elliot's traditional portrayal as a master manipulator and planner, this version of Elliot is more of a wannabe than a true threat, trying to take credit for teaching Bruce everything he knows without ever showing such abilities himself, making various mistakes in his attempt to impersonate Bruce after the surgery, and culminating in him being defeated by an all-new Batwoman her first time out in the suit."]}, {"page": "Batman (franchise)", "response": ["Bruce Wayne appears briefly on a magazine cover in The CW's Batwoman season one finale, portrayed by Warren Christie.
