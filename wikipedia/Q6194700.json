His membership of the band ran from 1962 until the group disbanded in 1981.Douglas wrote and self-published a semi-autobiographical book, Tunes, Tours and Travel-itis - Eighteen years of Facts, Faces and Fun with the Alex Welsh Band. in which he cites several humorous encounters with legends of the business, as well as recounting the band's many strange and bizarre misadventures. He followed this up three years later with Teenage to Travel-itis - Growing Up in a World of Jazz. The sequel chronicles his adventures in the Jazz world before and after his time with the Alex Welsh Band.\nHe played drums in his youth before switching to guitar.

The music of African American artists like Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by rock musicians. Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin, etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by Americans (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these Americans discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American Blues artists. Some of those influenced by this British Invasion went on to form garage rock bands, which later influenced the first wave of punk music in the UK."]}, {"page": "Big Bear Records", "response": ["The 1980s saw Big Bear Records returning to Simpson's first love, mainstream jazz and swing. Assembling a lineup of leading British jazz musicians including Humphrey Lyttelton, Dick Morrissey, Digby Fairweather, Dave Shepherd and Jim Douglas, Big Bear promoted a live jam session on 12 August 1984 at Birmingham's Cannon Hill Park, recorded and released on LP as The M&B Jam Session. The success of the event provided the impetus for the first Birmingham International Jazz Festival the following summer, which continues to be organised annually by Big Bear Music every July. In 1987, Big Bear launched The Jazz Rag magazine, which continues to publish bi-monthly, as well as The British Jazz Awards. The first edition of the awards was marked with a ceremony at Birmingham's Grand Hotel, where the jam session featuring the poll winners was recorded and released as the British Jazz Awards 1987 album."]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1942 in jazz, deaths of Bunny Berigan, Charlie Christian, Jaroslav Je\u017eek, Jimmy Blanton, Leo Adde, and Willie Cornish; births of Alan Skidmore, Amina Claudine Myers, Andrew White, Andy Summers, Aretha Franklin, Art Murphy, Bill Elgart, Bill Goodwin, Buster Williams, Byard Lancaster, Carl Saunders, Carlton Kitto, Cecil Bridgewater, Charles Braugham, Charles Tolliver, Cornell Dupree, Curtis Mayfield, Dan Jacobs, Dave Bargeron, Dave Green, David Friesen, Dave Matthews, Ditlef Eckhoff, Donald Ayler, Doug Hammond, Flora Purim, Frankie Lymon, Geoff Bull, Graeme Lyall, Han Bennink, Jack DeJohnette, James Blood Ulmer, Jane Getz, Jean-Luc Ponty, Jeremy Steig, Jim Douglas, Jimmy Owens, Ji\u0159\u00ed Stiv\u00edn, Jocelyne Jocya, Joe Chambers, John McLaughlin, John Taylor, Jon Lucien, Keith Ingham, Leon Russell, Letta Mbulu, Lionel Grigson, Lonnie Smith, Lyman Woodard, Maki Asakawa, Marc Moulin, Marlena Shaw, Michel Donato, Mike Abene, Nara Le\u00e3o, Oliver Lake, Peter Lemer, Philip Catherine, Pocho Lapouble, Randolph Colville, Ranee Lee, Richard Badendyck, Richard Stoltzman, Robin Kenyatta, Rusty Jones, Sammy Rimington, Steve Brown, Terje Fj\u00e6rn, Terumasa Hino, Teruo Nakamura, Tim Maia, Tomasz Stanko, Torgrim Sollid, Walter Payton, Wendell Harrison, Y\u014dsuke Yamashita, and Zdzis\u0142aw Piernik."]}]}}
