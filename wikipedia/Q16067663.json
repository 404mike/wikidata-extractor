Knott played for Oxford University Cricket Club and Kent County Cricket Club in the years before the First World War. He played occasionally after the war, including once for Sussex in 1926.\nKnott was considered one of cricket's brightest schoolboy talents at Tonbridge School but had a more disappointing time at Oxford. He also played varsity rugby union and was a fine all-round sportsman, later becoming a scratch golfer. He served in the British Army in both World Wars and won the Military Cross after being wounded in Macedonia in 1917.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ronald Poulton", "response": ["For the Varsity Match of 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Poulton play. That year he was at left centre, with Geen on the wing. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes and, moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5\u20130. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for another try, but the latter dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying to get closer to the posts. Geen did get a second try, from another Poulton break, but Cambridge, meanwhile, scored two tries and were leading 15\u201313 at the break. Another Cambridge try early in the second half gave them a five-point lead, but an injury to a winger reduced them to 14 men. Poulton capitalised on it: he scored from a dummy pass to Geen; and ran in a solo try after receiving a pass from flyhalf Freddie Knott. The end score was 23\u201318 to Oxford."]}, {"page": "Billy Geen", "response": ["Geen got his second try after another break from Poulton. Cambridge meanwhile scored two tries and at half-time were leading 15\u201313. Fifteen minutes into the second half, a second try for Cambridge put them five points ahead. An injury to one of Cambridge's scoring wings reduced the team to fourteen players; a forward moved to cover the wing, giving Oxford an advantage in the forwards. Poulton capitalised on it: he scored from a dummy pass to Geen; and ran in a solo try after receiving a pass from flyhalf Freddie Knott.

Against Oxford University at Cricket Field Road, Horsham, Sussex won the toss and elected to bat first, making 414 in their first-innings, during which Simms was dismissed for 4 runs by John Vidler.  Oxford University made 186 in their first-innings, during which Simms bowled fourteen overs, conceding 41 runs and taking the wicket of Freddie Knott.  Sussex forced Oxford University to follow-on in their second-innings, dismissing them for just 81 runs, to win by an innings and 147 runs.  In his second match against Gloucestershire at the County Ground, Hove, Sussex won the toss and elected to bat first, making 352 in their first-innings, during which Simms was dismissed for a single run by Charlie Parker.  Gloucestershire responded in their first-innings by making 155, during which Simms bowled nine overs, conceding 23 runs and taking the wicket of Cyril Sewell.

Keith Barlow played against both Cambridge and Oxford University, the only first-class appearances of his career. Other than Barlow, four players made their senior debuts for Kent during 1910: Eric Hatfeild, Charles Hooman, Freddie Knott and Percy Morfee. Hooman appeared 15 times for the county during the season, his only season of first-class cricket with Kent."]}, {"page": "John Knott (cricketer)", "response": ["Knott was considered a powerful batsman who could drive effectively. He played for Kent mainly during the school holidays when not working. His brother, Freddie Knott, had played cricket for Kent before World War I. Knott died in 1988. At the time of his death he was the oldest living Kent player and the oldest to have gained a cricket Blue at Oxford."]}]}}
