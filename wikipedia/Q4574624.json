He shaped Labour Party foreign policy in the 1930s, opposing pacifism and promoting rearmament against the German threat, and strongly opposed the appeasement policy of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Dalton served in Winston Churchill's wartime coalition cabinet; after the Dunkirk evacuation he was Minister of Economic Warfare, and established the Special Operations Executive. As Chancellor, he pushed his policy of cheap money too hard, and mishandled the sterling crisis of 1947. His political position was already in jeopardy in 1947 when he, seemingly inadvertently, revealed a sentence of the budget to a reporter minutes before delivering his budget speech. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted his resignation; Dalton later returned to the cabinet in relatively minor positions.", "Hugh Dalton was born in Neath, in Wales.

His father's first wife, Anne Dalton Allies, was a cousin of John Neale Dalton, tutor to Prince Albert Victor and Prince George and godfather to Fripp. Anne died in 1850 after giving birth to Fripp's half-sister, Annie. Fripp had another sister, Jeanie (Edith Jane), and a brother, Rex (Reginald). Annie married Edward Penny, who became physician to Marlborough College. Rex, a pupil of the school, died aged eighteen - in 1895; their parents died in the same bronchial epidemic. Jeanie had gained a 'Senior Optime' in Mathematics at Girton in 1886 and soon after married William Hale-White, son of Mark Rutherford. Hale-White, a physician, and Fripp, a surgeon, were to work at Guy's Hospital together for over thirty years.", "In 1883, on a visit to Cambridge to visit his sister, Fripp called on his godfather, John Neale Dalton, at Trinity, where the Canon was acting as 'chaperone' to Prince Albert Victor to whom Fripp was introduced. A year later he spent a few days at Cambridge in Prince \"Eddy's\" company. Six years passed in medical studies, sporting activities and theatre-going, when he accepted a two-week job as a locum tenens for Dr. Jalland, M. D., and an old Guy's man - in York. As Prince Eddy was stationed in the area and had to be attended to, they met up again. The Prince insisted that he accompany him to Deeside where Fripp became an accepted, if unofficial, doctor-in-residence to the Prince and other members of the Royal Family. Fripp was sent with Eddy on a Royal Tour to South Wales - with only the Prince's equerry, George Holford, in attendance. At the age of twenty-four, and still with exams to pass, he had the seal of Royal approval. When his \"hope of hopes\",Alfred Fripp by Cecil Roberts Prince Albert Victor, died in the 'flu' epidemic of 1892, he thought his Royal days were over; but four years later Edward, Prince of Wales, made him his Surgeon-in-Ordinary. With Holford's help and his own persistence, he persuaded Edward to preside over the Guy's Hospital Fund, ensuring the financial security of the Hospital - before he had been given a post there. However, after this Cooper Perry and Cosmo Bonsor persuaded the Board to create an Assistant Surgeon post for him. This, and his private practice in his brother-in-law's house in Harley Street, established him as a doctor, teacher and surgeon. A year later, just before his marriage, he set up as a consultant in his own home, 19 Portland Place. For the next thirty years aristocrats, plutocrats and famous stage personalities were frequent visitors - most as patients and friends."]}, {"page": "Deputy Clerk of the Closet", "response": ["* Rev'd Canon John Neale Dalton, KCVO 1897\u2013 (re-appointed 1901)"]}, {"page": "1931 in Wales", "response": ["*28 July - John Neale Dalton, chaplain and tutor to the British royal family, settled in South Wales, 91"]}, {"page": "Dalton (surname)", "response": ["*John Neale Dalton (1839\u20131931), British cleric"]}, {"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*John Neale Dalton (1839\u20131931) \u2013 chaplain to Queen Victoria and tutor to George V of the United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "1830s in Wales", "response": ["**24 September - John Neale Dalton, royal chaplain and tutor (d. 1931)"]}, {"page": "1839 in Wales", "response": ["*24 September (in England) \u2013 John Neale Dalton, royal chaplain and tutor (d. 1931)"]}, {"page": "Dean and Canons of Windsor", "response": ["*32.
