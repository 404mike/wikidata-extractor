British daily casualty rates (3,645 per day) were heavier during this period than at the Somme (2,950) or Passchendaele (2,121) (but not Arras: 4,070 over a shorter period), because British forces were attacking across the line, instead of being rotated through a single offensive.Hart 2008, p. 364. The military historian, Gary Sheffield, called this, the so-called Hundred Days Offensive, \"by far the greatest military victory in British history\".", "One of Haig's defenders was the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (The Educated Soldier) in 1963, in which Haig was portrayed as a \"Great Captain\" of the calibre of the Duke of Marlborough or the Duke of Wellington. Terraine, taking his cue from Haig's \"Final Despatch\" of 1918, also argued that Haig pursued the only strategy possible, given the situation the armies were in: that of attrition which wore down the German army and delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce of 1918. Gary Sheffield stated that although Terraine's arguments about Haig have been much attacked over forty years, Terraine's thesis \"has yet to be demolished\".", "Haig was played by Sir John Mills in the 1969 film, Oh! What a Lovely War, in which much of the dialogue is taken from Clark's The Donkeys. He is portrayed as being indifferent to the fate of the troops under his command, his goal being to wear the Germans down even at the cost of enormous losses and to prevail, since the Allies will have the last 10,000 men left. Gary Sheffield notes that although the film said more about 1960s attitudes than it did about the war, it helped to shape popular memory of the war, being \"much quoted, alluded to and parodied\".Sheffield 2002, pp. 20\u201321."]}, {"page": "Mike Jackson (British Army officer)", "response": ["At the end of 2006 Jackson took up a consultancy job with PA Consulting Group, and he has given lectures on leadership. He also serves as a non-executive director for ForceSelect and security company Legion and is a member of Rolls-Royce's International Advisory Board.

Gary Sheffield, writing in The Independent, called the book \"an engaging and honest account that would repay reading by all those who seek to understand the 21st-century British Army\", but Peter Beaumont, foreign affairs editor for The Observer, called it \"disappointing\" and commented that \"in the end it is Jackson's opinions\u00a0... rather than any powerful new detail that emerges\".

Along with Smith-Dorrien and Allenby, he served under the overall command of Lieutenant-General French.Farrar-Hockley 1974, p. 60 Gough was marked for consideration for a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy in late April 1901, although this promotion was not to take effect until he became a substantive major in his own regiment.Farrar-Hockley 1975, p. 62: Sheffield writes that he actually held this brevet rank in 1901, which appears to be an error; Farrar-Hockley's more detailed account states that he was a local unpaid major Major-General Smith-Dorrien wrote to Gough's father praising him and expressing a wish that he could be promoted straightaway.Farrar-Hockley 1974, pp. 63\u201364 On 17 September 1901 he led the Composite Regiment, after inadequate reconnaissance, to attack what appeared a tempting target of Boers near Blood River Port, only to be taken prisoner with his entire force by larger Boer forces which had been out of sight. After he escaped, Kitchener (the commander-in-chief) expressed his \"deepest sympathy\", and he may have survived with his reputation largely intact because his overconfidence was in favourable contrast to the timidity which had contributed to other British defeats. To his credit, according to Gary Sheffield, Gough discussed the matter at length in his memoirs Soldiering On. Although preparations were made to restore the Composite Regiment to full strength, Gough was wounded in the right hand and arm in November, losing the tip of one finger. He was invalided home on the steamship Plassy in January 1902, and reverted to his substantive rank of captain.Farrar-Hockley 1975, p. 69", "Gough practised top-down command to a degree which was unusual in the British Army of that era, with its culture, evolved in an army designed for fighting small colonial wars, of leaving decisions to \"the man on the spot\". Andy Simpson argues that although Gough's command methods were clearly more prescriptive than those of Rawlinson's Fourth Army, in which a 20-page summary of division commanders' views was circulated in late August, given Rawlinson's lack of grip this was not necessarily a bad thing. Simpson argues that Gough's hands-on control may have been at Haig's urging, given Haig's dissatisfaction with Rawlinson, and suggests that this may also have been a factor in Gough being employed in major offensives in 1917, whereas Rawlinson was not.Simpson 2006, pp. 49\u201350, 53 Michael Howard cited Gough's love of micro-managing divisions as evidence that he had been overpromoted, and Gary Sheffield concedes that Gough's reputation for touring the trenches to spot dirty rifles suggests that he had found it hard to adapt to his greater responsibilities.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 83", "Ian Beckett (1999), building on Tim Travers' (1987) concept of a \"command vacuum\", argues that Gough's failings can in part be attributed to structural failings in the BEF chain of command, as officers grappled with the problems of commanding large formations under stalemate conditions, and the degree of initiative which should be permitted to subordinates. Gary Sheffield does not agree, and argues that before 1918 Gough's \"poor performance at Third Ypres\" masked the \"tactical and operational improvements\" which were being made.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 80"]}, {"page": "38th (Welsh) Infantry Division", "response": ["Historian Gary Sheffield commented that, since the division was \"employed on trench-holding duties from September 1917 to July 1918\", it likely \"was not regarded by GHQ as an elite 'storm' formation\". He noted, \"judged by the results of their attacks during the Hundred Days\" the division \"was in a select band of elite divisions\" akin to the Australian, Canadian and a limited number of other British formations. Sheffield credited Cubitt, \"a hard-bitten, ruthless 'fire-eater'\", for the improved performance of the division during this period, along with the various breaks the division had away from the line when they were able to train and assimilate new knowledge that resulted in \"devolution of command\" which allowed command flexibility among lower ranks. In addition, Sheffield cited improved staff work and tactical doctrine and high morale, which had led to the ability of the division to carry out effective combined arms operations."]}, {"page": "Battle of Flers\u2013Courcelette", "response": ["In his 2011 biography of Haig, Gary Sheffield wrote that the tanks had been slow and unreliable and were the cause of huge casualties where tank lanes had been left in the barrage. In August, after watching a demonstration, Haig had written that army thinking about the tactical use of tanks needed to be clarified. The integration of tanks into the BEF weapons system that was developing was rudimentary and Rawlinson was much less optimistic about their potential. Sheffield criticised the \"20/20 hindsight\" of writers who complained that using the tanks was premature and agreed with Haig that it was \"folly [to fail] to use every means at my disposal in what was likely to be the crowning effort this year\". With the tanks in France, the secret of their existence would have been revealed before long anyway."]}, {"page": "Lions led by donkeys", "response": ["Later, Strachan, in reviewing Aspects of the British experience of the First World War edited by Michael Howard, observed that \"In the study of the First World War in particular, the divide between professionals and amateurs has never been firmly fixed\".

The Sunday Times November 5, 2008 Gordon Corrigan, for example, did not even consider Clark to be a historian.Corrigan, p. 213. \"Alan Clark was an amusing writer, a brilliant story teller and bon viveur. British political life is the poorer for his passing, but he cannot be described as a historian\". The phrase \"lions led by donkeys\" has been said to have produced a false, or at least very incomplete, picture of generalship in the First World War, giving an impression of Generals as \"ch\u00e2teau Generals\", living in splendour, indifferent to the sufferings of the men under their command, only interested in cavalry charges and shooting cowards. One historian wrote that \"the idea that they were indifferent to the sufferings of their men is constantly refuted by the facts, and only endures because some commentators wish to perpetuate the myth that these generals, representing the upper classes, did not give a damn what happened to the lower orders\". Some current academic opinion has described this school of thought as \"discredited\".Simpson, Andy, Directing Operations: British Corps Command on the Western Front, p. 181.Sheffield, Gary.

The article quotes Andrew Gordon stating \"It really is time to put away this enduring myth. To claim that Germany failed to invade in 1940 because of what was done by phenomenally brave and skilled young men of Fighter Command is hogwash.
