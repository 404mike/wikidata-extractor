Her experiences as a nurse at St. Catherine's Hospital for the Mentally Handicapped and other hospitals led to a career as a child care expert. She was nicknamed \"the baby whisperer\" for her ability to placate infants. Hogg emigrated to the United States in 1992 and became famous in her last years for guiding young parents in California, among them Jodie Foster, Cindy Crawford, Jamie Lee Curtis and Calista Flockhart. Her fee for 3 weeks of babysitting was said to be over $15,000.\nHer first book, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer: How To Calm, Connect, and Communicate With Your Baby, co-authored by journalist Melinda Blau, was published in 2001. It became a New York Times bestseller. One year later, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers was published and became a national bestseller as well.\nIn June 2002 Hogg teamed up with Discovery Health in Great Britain to produce a fifteen-part television series entitled The Baby Whisperer. In 2004, as she was battling cancer, Hogg and Blau collaborated on The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems. Hogg died of melanoma on 25 November 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Secrets of the Baby Whisperer", "response": ["Secrets of the Baby Whisperer: How to Calm, Connect, and Communicate with Your Baby is a popular book by Tracy Hogg and Melinda Blau, aimed at guiding new parents through their baby's first year."]}, {"page": "The Baby Whisperer", "response": ["The Baby Whisperer is a fifteen-part Discovery Home and Health TV series presented by Tracy Hogg (The Baby Whisperer).", "# Baby Ella - Tracy Hogg helps a baby and her parents break the association between food and sleep.", "# Baby James - Tracy Hogg is called in to help baby James sleep for longer when his parents complain that he keeps them awake all night.", "# Caitlin Hall - Fifteen-month-old Caitlin will not eat solids, so Tracy Hogg suggests how to wean her off milk.", "# Hamish Frost - Baby whisperer Tracy Hogg visits a mother who is finding it difficult to care for her premature baby.", "# Leanne O'Condell - A mother-to-be is worried at the thought of breastfeeding, so Tracy Hogg tries to reassure her by offering guidelines.", "# Max Brown - A toddler is rough with his baby brother, so Tracy Hogg helps him and his mother adjust to life with the new arrival.", "# Primrose Lennon - Baby Primrose will not take a bottle and her mother is reaching the end of her tether, prompting a visit from Tracy Hogg.", "# Sophia Calkins - Baby Sophia refuses to be weaned off breast-feeding, so Tracy Hogg comes up with a solution to encourage her to eat solids.", "# Xavier Blore - Baby Xavier's parents hide anxiously in the kitchen to avoid waking him, until Tracy Hogg arrives to offer suggestions on how their child should be treated."]}]}}
