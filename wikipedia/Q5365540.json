The writer Player in the Brisbane Courier, believed that the first Test was Australia's only chance to beat the British team, as he felt that with the British team's condition improving during the tour, they would be impossible to beat. The British team had been dealing with some illness and injury, necessitating the fielding of a team in the Test that was not their first choice, but in the end identical to the team that played New South Wales the previous weekend. Elliot Nicholson, Alec Timms, and Charles Thompson were all listed as playing, but last minute changes were made. While at a swimming bath, Nicholson injured his foot on a protruding nail, and was unable to play. Bucher played in his place. Timms did not recover from an injury received in the match at Goulburn in time to make the field. Adamson, was moved from the halves to the three-quarters to fill his place, and in turn Cookson filled the opening in the halves left by Adamson. Martelli, who had injured his thumb in the match against Goulburn, and had taken the field against New South Wales, but had to retire due to injury, recovered in time to play in place of Thompson. It had been feared on the evening before the match, that Gwyn Nicholls had caught influenza and would be incapacitated, but instead was a severe cold. Rev. Mullineux also took to the field with a cold. The British played field of four players, at three-quarters, and two half-backs, that contrasted with the Australian field of only one half-back, two at five-eighth, and three at three-quarters.", "British Isles: Esmond Martelli, Charles Thompson, Alf Bucher, Alec Timms, Elliot Nicholson, Charlie Adamson, Gwyn Nicholls, Gerry Doran, Matthew Mullineux captain, George Cookson, Frank Stout, William Judkins, Guy Evers, Wallace Jarman, Tom McGown, John Francomb, Blair Swannell, H.G.S.
