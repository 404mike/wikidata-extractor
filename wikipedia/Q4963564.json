The road crew included Geoff Mann as backdrop painter, and Rick Battersby as dry ice engineer.  Devoil's previous musical experience was of various local bands in Reading, including Trash with whom he recorded a single \"Priorities\" released by Polydor in October the previous year. Revell's previous bands (in Bournemouth) included Joe Soap and The Bubbles and Abraxas. Later in 1978, Clive Mitten wandered into a rehearsal and asked for a job. Devoil described Mitten as being very good in creating opportunities, convincing them when he said \"you need a bass player\". Mitten had previously played with local bands in Brighton, including Luna Hare.", "In the period since the band's demise, a number of archive live recordings have become officially available from Brian Devoil's archives and a new compilation album, Voices in the Night was released in 2007.", "Quite unexpectedly in June 2007, Clive Mitten and Andy Sears announced a one-off gig performing Twelfth Night material to take place in November 2007. By July, it had been confirmed that they would be billed as Twelfth Night, and in September, a 2nd gig was added and both Andy Revell and Brian Devoil were revealed as part of the line-up, with Mark Spencer (formerly the vocalist in 80s prog band LaHost, Andy Sears' one time flatmate, and an old friend of the band) replacing Rick Battersby. The band were invited to headline the 10th Tiana Festival in Barcelona in May 2008 - their second only concert outside of the UK, the previous being a concert in Germany in 1984.
