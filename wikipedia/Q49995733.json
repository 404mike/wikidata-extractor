Following the death of her father in an industrial accident in 1900, Driscoll took up employment as a domestic servant to a local publican's family. She rapidly descended into crime and alcoholism, and over the next few years was regularly convicted of prostitution, theft, and alcohol-related public order offences. She married in 1906, becoming Catherine Lynch, and although her criminal activity appears to have fallen somewhat following her marriage she continued drinking heavily.\nIn October 1908, at the age of 28, she collapsed and died at home while preparing to go out for the evening. A subsequent inquest attributed her death to a syncope induced by alcohol. The presiding coroner was harshly critical of her, describing her as \"one of a class who were a nuisance to themselves, their husbands and everybody else\" and as symptomatic of an increase in drunkenness among Swansea's women. He was also critical of her husband John Lynch for having continued to support her despite her alcoholism, instead of having taken the opportunity to have her incarcerated.\nIn her lifetime, Lynch attracted little notice beyond official records and local newspaper accounts.  Her life was examined by local historian Elizabeth Belcham in her book Swansea's 'Bad Girls': Crime and Prostitution 1870s\u20131914.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Prisoner characters \u2013 inmates", "response": ["* Jackie Louise Donahue (Catherine Lynch \u2013 episodes 261\u2013290) \u2013 a young prostitute who is picked up by a middle-aged man named Ron Crosby in episode 261 and goes back with him to his motel in a taxi driven by prisoner Judy Bryant who is now on parole who witness Crosby treating Jackie in a harsh manner during the ride.
