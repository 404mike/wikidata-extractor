The expansion of its cultivation throughout the islands and its export to England from 1870 to 1878  had an enormous impact on the economy of the Canary Islands for more than a century until the consolidation of mass tourism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elizabeth Murray (painter)", "response": ["thumb|Watercolour portrait of Alfred Diston by Elizabeth Murray, painted in 1854", "The Murrays were close friends with the Diston family. Alfred Diston was born on 8 January 1793 in Lowestoft, England and arrived in the commercial centre of Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife in 1810. Here he married Mar\u00eda Soledad de Orea, with whom he had a daughter, Soledad \"Solita\" Diston y Orea. He was named an Honorary Academic of RACBA on 24 October 1851, possibly sponsored by French naturalist and ethnologist Sabin Berthelot. ", "In 1859, Murray published her monograph Sixteen Years of an Artist's Life in Morocco, Spain, and the Canary Islands. In it she described Canarian society at that time and explained some questions regarding her artwork and the representation of said society. Alfred Diston's contribution to support Murray, Notes furnished Mrs. Murray for her intended work on these islands, was very important. Its description was historically and culturally significant with regards to the festivities, customs, and folklore of the islands, as well as demographic data and descriptions of the cities.", "Soledad Diston, also known as Solita, was born on 2 November 1837 in Puerto de la Cruz. She was the daughter of Alfred Diston and Mar\u00eda de la Soledad de Orea. She was 13 years old when Murray arrived in the Canary Islands. The quick friendship between the Murrays and Distons meant that Soledad's first artistic endeavours were under the tutelage of Elizabeth Murray. She even travelled with Murray to Tenerife to continue her studies."]}]}}
