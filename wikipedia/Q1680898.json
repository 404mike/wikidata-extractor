Having no suitable meeting place to host the meeting, the town raised the money themselves by personal subscription and built the Music Hall. It was capable of holding about 2,500 people and so successful was the meeting that associate membership, necessary to gain access to the proceedings, had to be capped. Prominent among the local organisers were Professors James Clerk Maxwell (Natural Philosophy) and James Nicol (Geology) of Marischal College. Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, took on the role of President for the year. The young Maxwell himself, still only 28, spoke on three different subjects, one being a presentation of his newly discovered law of molecular velocities in a gas. The \u2018Maxwell distribution law\u2019, as it is now known, is the law of physics with the strongest Aberdeen connection. In addition, Sir Charles Lyell, President of the Geological Section of the British Academy, and a champion Charles Darwin's work, made one of the first announcements that Darwin had undertaken a body of work on evolution and was about to release his findings. The organisers felt that they might be risking something in holding the meeting much further north than they had done before but in the event the Aberdeen meeting was the most well attended the BA had ever had."]}, {"page": "Roderick Murchison", "response": ["The chief geological investigation of the last decade of his life was devoted to the Highlands of Scotland, where he wrongly believed he had succeeded in showing that the vast masses of crystalline schists, previously supposed to be part of what used to be termed the Primitive formations, were really not older than the Silurian period, for that underneath them lay beds of limestone and quartzite containing Lower Silurian (Cambrian) fossils.

During the nineteenth century Knockan Crag became the subject of much debate when geologists noted that the Moine schists at the top of the crag appeared to be older than the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks such as Durness limestone lower down. Disagreements over the processes that could have caused this to occur were referred to at the time as the 'Highlands Controversy'. The argument was primarily between Roderick Murchison and Archibald Geikie on the one hand and James Nicol and Charles Lapworth on the other. Murchison and Geikie believed the sequence was wrong and that the Moine schists must be the younger rocks. The controversy was finally resolved by the work of Ben Peach and John Horne whose 1907 paper on the subject remains a classic text. Peach and Horne demonstrated that the situation resulted from the action of a thrust fault - this being the first to be discovered anywhere in the world. The older rocks had been moved some 70\u00a0kilometres to the west over the top of the younger rocks due to tectonic action.Dryburgh, P. M. et al. (1995) Assynt: The geologists' Mecca.

Wondering whether the Northwest Highlands of Scotland might be Precambrian he visited in 1880 and presented a paper to the Geological Society in which he rejected Roderick Murchison's theory that gneiss was overlying limestone without an intervening unconformity. He considered that the limestone had been deposited over the gneiss which had then been raised to the surface by faulting. He thought the variability and complexity of the highland rock structures made it impossible to accept a theory that there was an overall succession in time of rock strata. He went on to take a major part in the Highlands controversy, generally confirming the work of James Nicol but finding that along a thrust fault from Loch Eriboll to Ullapool Nicol's \"igneous rock\" was usually Lewisian gneiss, about  thick, thrust over Ordovician rock."]}]}}
