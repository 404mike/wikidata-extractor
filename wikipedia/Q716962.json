In 1727, Alexander Pope satirized Theophilus Cibber in his Dunciad as a youth who \"thrusts his person full into your face\" (III 132). On the stage, he was famous for playing Pistol in Henry IV, Part 2, and some of the comic roles his father had played when younger, but unsympathetic critics accused him of overemphasis.

Even more important was the attention of her father-in-law Colley Cibber who, recognizing in Susannah the makings of a great tragic actress, trained her. Susannah received hours of acting tuition from her new father-in-law, and he helped teach her valuable vocal intonations and tragic gestures that shaped her into the most celebrated tragedienne of her time. Further, adopting a 'Cibberian identity' proved very advantageous for Susannah's career. Public audiences began to view her as the young ing\u00e9nue of the Cibber acting dynasty, which in turn, helped land her leading roles.

In the eight to ten years before the Act was passed, the Haymarket was an alternative to John Rich's Theatre Royal, Covent Garden and the opera-dominated Drury Lane Theatre.

With the aid of the Duke of York he procured a royal licence to exhibit plays during four months in each year from May to September during his lifetime.

Despite her father's request to reinstate her position, Charlotte decided to the Drury Lane behind and move on to different endeavours.  Charlotte was denied entry to many theatres once she left Drury Lane which made it very difficult to find work, so Charlotte picked a smaller Venue and wrote/performed a story called The Art of Management (Fields Part II). She decided to create her own company in the summer of 1735 in Lincoln's Inn Fields.  She wrote her first play, The Art of Management, in September 1735.  It was an explicit attack on Fleetwood, who attempted to buy up all printed copies of the play to prevent its circulating.", "In 1742, Charlotte got a new acting company in the New Theatre in St. James's, and she produced her second play, Tit for Tat, or, Comedy and Tragedy at War.
