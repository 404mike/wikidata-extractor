He is a computer professional, an expert on IRC and has written a book on the subject, IRC Survival Guide: Talk to the World with Internet Relay Chat, published in 1995 by Addison-Wesley. He is also a performer with three years experience as a semi-professional actor on the festival circuit, two years as a professional in London and in provincial repertory theatre, and further experience as a director in television. The aforementioned extensive cross-disciplinary experience motivated Harris to explore the potential of creating a Shakespeare performance online; namely, a contemporary production of Shakespeare's Hamlet known as Hamnet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Hamnet Players", "response": ["The Hamnet Players were founded in 1993 by Stuart Harris, an Englishman living in San Diego, California, a former actor, computer professional and author of computer manuals.  In December 1993 they debuted the concept of internet theatre with their debut production of \"Hamnet\", a parody of William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\", followed later in April 1994 with their second production of \"PCbeth: an IBM clone of Macbeth,\", another parody of a Shakespeare play, this time using \"Macbeth\". In February 1995 they moved away from Shakespeare and used the plot of the Tennessee Williams's play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", to create their third original piece \"An IRC Channel Named #desire\". The Hamnet Players performances are a form of virtual theatre, first of all, because they are focused gatherings, just like face-to-face encounters.Goffman.
