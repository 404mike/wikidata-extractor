He was a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and a psychotherapist and lecturer at the Department of Psychiatry, Leeds University, and also a Congregationalist minister. He was described by Dr. Jock Sutherland as \"one of the psychoanalytic immortals\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Psychoanalysis", "response": ["Members of the Society have included: Michael Balint, Wilfred Bion, John Bowlby, Ronald Fairbairn, Anna Freud, Harry Guntrip, Melanie Klein, Donald Meltzer, Joseph J.

The psychiatrist Carl Jung, founder of analytical psychology, valued the work. The biographer Vincent Brome recalls Jung remarking in 1938 that it exposed \"some of the shortcomings of science\". The philosopher Paul Ric\u0153ur endorsed \"procedures of invalidation\" similar to Popper's criteria for falsifiability. The historian Peter Gay described the work as \"an important treatise in epistemology\". The philosopher Bryan Magee considered Popper's criticisms of logical positivism \"devastating\". In his view, Popper's most important argument against logical positivism is that, while it claimed to be a scientific theory of the world, its central tenet, the verification principle, effectively destroyed all of science.Magee, Bryan. Confessions of a Philosopher. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1997, p. 46. The physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont argued that critiques of Popper's work have provoked an \"irrationalist drift\", and that a significant part of the problems that currently affect the philosophy of science \"can be traced to ambiguities or inadequacies\" in The Logic of Scientific Discovery.Sokal, Alan.
