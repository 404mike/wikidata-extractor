Both clubs made comfortable progress; Luton scored 14 goals and conceded three, Arsenal on the other hand conceded two fewer. Luton for the final were without Darron McDonough who injured himself in training, but David Preece and Ricky Hill both returned to the side after lengthy periods of treatment. Goalkeeper Les Sealey was not fit in time to play, so Andy Dibble deputised in goal for only his sixth appearance of the season. Gus Caesar replaced David O'Leary in Arsenal's starting eleven, as the Irishman was ruled out for the final having damaged his achilles weeks prior.", "Luton manager Ray Harford had doubts over his team selection for the final. Though buoyed by the return of David Preece and Ricky Hill to full training, he was without Darron McDonough who injured his knee ligaments in training. Harford said the instability presented a selection dilemma, telling reporters: \"I think I have got to break somebody's heart by telling him he is not playing.\" He admitted Luton's poor run of form since losing the Full Members Cup was a reason why he would make changes for the Wembley final, and noted his side's difficulty on grass away from home. Harford identified David Rocastle as Arsenal's biggest threat and felt they had few weaknesses in the side other than the ability to finish chances. He believed O'Leary absence through injury was a big loss for Arsenal, and implied that Williams was needed in midfield: \"Without him they don't have a leader. He has a presence and that Wembley flair.\""]}, {"page": "1988 Full Members' Cup Final", "response": ["|CM ||4 || Darron McDonough"]}, {"page": "Darren McDonough", "response": ["#REDIRECT Darron McDonough"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Darron McDonough"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": [" Mervyn Day was brought in as a short-term replacement, while midfielder Darron McDonough moved to Newcastle United.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Darron McDonough", "| March 1992 ||  Darron McDonough || Newcastle United ||align=\"right\"| \u00a390,000 ||align=\"center\"|"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Darron McDonough"]}, {"page": "Darron", "response": ["*Darron McDonough (born 1962), former English footballer"]}]}}
