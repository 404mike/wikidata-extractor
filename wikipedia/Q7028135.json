His son, Nick Weir, was the host of several game-shows, before becoming a cruise ship entertainment manager."]}, {"page": "Catchphrase (British game show)", "response": ["Catchphrase was presented by Northern Irish comedian Roy Walker from its 1986 premiere until 1999, airing weekly at night. Nick Weir took the programme over in 2000 and hosted it until the end of series 16 on 23 April 2004. Mark Curry replaced Weir for the final series, which moved to a daytime slot and ran from 24 June to 19 December 2002.", "In the original series, two contestants, one male and one female, standing in blue lectern and red lectern, (in the Roy Walker era), and the purple lectern and orange lectern (in the Nick Weir/Mark Curry era) would have to identify the familiar phrase represented by a piece of animation accompanied by background music. The show's mascot, a golden robot called \"Mr. Chips\", appears in many of the animations. In the revived version of the show, the same format remains, but there are three contestants and there is no particular attention paid to gender.", "In the Nick Weir series, there was no money randomiser; the cash prize was set as default to \u00a3100 in round 1 and \u00a3150 in round 2. In Weir's third and final series, the round 2 amount for a normal catchphrase was doubled to \u00a3200, and for the final series with Mark Curry, these were replaced with the corresponding points values.", "When Nick Weir took over as host in 2000, not only would contestants win the money allocated but they would also win spot prizes if a sound was played after the contestant guessed a catchphrase correctly. During the 2001 series, this new feature was changed, with the (now different) sound to indicate a spot prize could be won being played before the catchphrase was shown, this was carried over into the revived Mulhern series. In Weir's last series, the spot prizes were removed and instead, one catchphrase in the first half of the game was also worth a 'Travel Bonus' prize, which was generally a weekend/short break away in a European city. If one player got a normal catchphrase wrong and the other player incorrectly guesses the same catchphrase, the game would just continue with neither player getting the predetermined amount of money or a chance at solving the bonus catchphrase. There was no bell used for the first half of the game for the Weir/Curry/Mulhern era.", "A correct answer won the contestant the predetermined money amount, plus a chance to solve the bonus catchphrase, which was hidden behind nine squares with the show's logo on each (or random shapes in the Nick Weir/Mark Curry era). The contestant chose a square by hitting their buzzer to stop a randomiser on one of them. That square was then removed, and the contestant had five seconds to come up with an answer. If they were right, they won the amount of money in the bonus bank.", "In series 1, the bonus bank would start at \u00a3100 and increase by \u00a3100 each round for the first two episodes and for the rest of that series, it would start at \u00a350 and increase by \u00a350 each round. However, in series 2, the bonus bank increased with each regular round, not counting the Ready Money Round. This format carried on from series 2 until series 9. In series 10 (the first Carlton series), it would start at \u00a3150 and increase by \u00a350 each round, but \u00a310 would be deducted for each square removed. From series 11 until series 15, it would start at \u00a3200 and increase by \u00a350 each round, again with \u00a310 deducted for each square removed but in series 16 (Nick Weir's third and final series), the bonus bank still started at \u00a3200 in round 1 and \u00a3400 in round 2. In rounds 1 and 2, it would still eliminate \u00a310 for every random shape removed (Mark Curry's round 2 would deduct by 20 points on the 400 points bonus). In rounds three and four, the bank would start at \u00a31,000 and reduce by \u00a3100 increments. For the final series (with Mark Curry), the pound values were replaced with corresponding point values.", "In 2000, when Nick Weir took over as host, this round was replaced by the \"Cash Countdown\", in which the amount for each normal catchphrase started at \u00a3250 before quickly counting down \u00a31 every .08 of a second. The quicker the contestants could answer, the more money they would win. In 2001, the starting value was increased to \u00a3500 minus \u00a31 for each .04 of a second (\u00a325 per second).", "When Nick Weir took over as host in 2000, the format of the Super Catchphrase changed considerably. Now, in a similar fashion as on Blockbusters, the contestant had to make their way from the left-hand side of the board to the right (in a horizontal line), making adjoining moves and passing on a square meant that they would be blocked and would have to find an alternative path (excluding diagonals). This format was also used in the Mark Curry series. As before, the top prize was a holiday. In Weir's first series in 2000, the holiday randomiser remained, but from series 15 (2001), this was dropped and instead both contestants each nominated a location of their choice to go to if they won, revealed at the beginning of the show. In the Curry daytime series in 2002, this feature was still included but the choice was limited to somewhere in Europe, and these choices were revealed before the second round of the main game. Each square was worth \u00a3100 if the contestant was not successful in getting all the way across the board.", "Throughout Nick Weir's series of Catchphrase, Mr. Chips was not featured in any of the Catchphrases. Instead, a family of a father, mother, son and two other men appeared. These characters were also featured in the opening sequence, showing the family trying to 'catch' the 'letters' of the phrase \"Catchphrase\", the family themselves as the letters of \"Catch\". This family were not as popular as Mr. Chips, but despite this, the family appeared until the series finished in 2002.

The winner got a bonus prize, as in the US version, but the loser had to pay a forfeit. The prizes and forfeits were based on the storylines of the grudge.
