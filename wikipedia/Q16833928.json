The sport of cricket had acquired most of its modern features by this time and the period saw the establishment of roundarm bowling as an accepted practise.\nCounty cricket clubs began to become more formally established during this period and Sussex County Cricket Club, the oldest professional sporting organisation in the world, was formerly established in 1839. This would soon be followed by formal organisations in other counties, although the County Championship was not formally established until 1890.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1726 and 1840 inclusive.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duke (surname)", "response": ["Duke is a surname meaning 'the leader' or 'son of Marmaduke'. It is the 856th most common surname in the United States.", "The first is that the surname Duke and its variant, Dukes, are both derived from the various Middle English words duc, duk, and douc, which all came from the Old French word \"duc.\" This ultimately stemmed from the Latin dux, meaning \"leader,\" and is a derivative of ducere, \"to lead.\" The surname was evidently acquired by someone who was looked upon as a leader, not denoting one of noble birth since many captains or military leaders were titled landholders who would have taken their last names from their estates. The surname Dukes translates literally as \"Duke's son.\"", "References date back to the late twelfth century, with Herbert le Duc, a member of the Knights Templar, using the Gallicized version of the name. From 1190\u20131191, Roger le Duc was Sheriff of London, and three generations of his family succeeded him in this office. The Pipe rolls for Berkshire refer to Adam Duke in the year 1198, and in 1214 one Henry Dukes is recorded in the Curia Regis rolls for Warwickshire.", "==Dukes==", "Dukes is a patronymic form of the surname Duke that originated in medieval England, of Anglo-Norman origin. The meaning is derived from son or descendant of Duke, which was originally recorded le Duc, a term used to mean \"leader\" before it became associated with a specific rank of the nobility. It is an uncommon name; the 2000 United States Census showed it to be the 1,577th most popular surname,namenum.com while the United Kingdom Census of that same year showed it to be the 1,749th most popular.", "*Arnold de Dukes in 1200, Cambridgeshire,", "*Henry or Henricus Dukes in 1214, Warwickshire.sourced from the Curia Regis Rolls of Warwickshire", "Duke families were also found very early in Ireland. According to O\u2019Hart\u2019s Irish Pedigrees, Vol. II, some were residing in County Westmeath in the Fifteenth century. The will of one William Duke, of Kyllenagh, Kildare, recorded 1551, is found in the records at Dublin. After this early date, the family name appears with more or less variation in form, and with increasing frequency upon the pages of the Irish Public Records. Hanna, in his Scotch-Irish Families of Ulster, estimates that there were in 1890 within the province of Ulster 268 persons bearing the name Duke.", "Thus the Dukes were one of the ancient families of England and of Ireland. They are among the earliest recorded by Burke in his pedigrees of the nobility and of the landed gentry. The first mention made of them by this authority was the aforementioned Roger le Duc, sheriff of London. The names of Duke and Dukes have been well-established in the Americas, with one of the earliest arrivals to New England being one Captain Edward Duke in 1634. Humphrey Dukes sailed to Barbados with his wife and servants in 1630.", "==Notable people named Duke==", "* Duke (Cambridgeshire cricketer), given name unknown, active 1831", "* Annie Duke (born 1965), American poker player", "* Basil W.
