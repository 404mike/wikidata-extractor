He established the University's Electronic Music Studio (EMS) in 1968, the first in a university in the North of England. The studio began as a \u2018classical\u2019 tape studio, but later adopted the technologies of the voltage-controlled synthesizer and digital systems. He proposed the Project teaching system which is still the basis of teaching at York and which has been emulated by many University Music departments around the world. He established the Mediamix series of concerts, which combined performances of electro-acoustic compositions with film, dance and other performance media. He was a co-founder of the Composers Desktop Project, which placed affordable sound technologies on the individual composer's desk, and developed musical composition software, which formed part of the CDP system. \nIn the early 1980s, with his colleague Dr. Ross Kirk from the Department of Electronics at York, he started work on the concept of Music Technology as an academic discipline. This led to the establishment of the world's first postgraduate course in Music Technology in 1986.\nIn 1992 he began working on his algorithmic composition language, Tabula Vigilans, designed for real-time performance.\nOn taking early retirement from the University of York in 1996, he was honoured by the University with a lifetime Emeritus Readership.\nDuring his lifetime, he wrote a considerable amount of music. As well as this, he contributed teaching materials to the Open University in its early days and wrote \"Electronic Music for Schools\", published in 1981.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ondes Martenot", "response": ["* Richard Orton and Hugh Davies: \"Ondes martenot\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, first edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell, London, Macmillan Publishers, 1980, pp. 237\u2013242"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Richard Orton, 72, composer and academic."]}, {"page": "Orton (surname)", "response": ["*Richard Orton (1940\u20132013), British academic and composer of electronic music"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2013", "response": ["*Richard Orton, 72, British composer and academic.Richard Orton (1940 - 12 Feb 2013), composersdesktop.com, 23 February 2013"]}, {"page": "Orton, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Orton"]}]}}
