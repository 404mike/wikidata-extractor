This disagreement forms part of a wider debate on the meaning of the mainly Venetian tradition of the reclining female nude, which Titian had created, or helped to create, some 25 years before with the Dresden Venus of around 1510\u201311.

The latter painting is dated 1511, very close to the timeline of completion for this painting. As Hope observed, Pastoral Concert itself has not been cleaned. It is impossible to tell if the painting could be Mancini's without proper restoration.As an artist, Mancini was known to borrow elements and mimic the style of certain Italian Masters. His painting Madonna with Saints Francis and Roch takes significant cues from Giovanni Bellini's San Zaccaria Altarpiece."]}]}}
