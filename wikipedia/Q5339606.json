In 2016, Edmund King, president of the Automobile Association, attributed congestion on the M25 to excessive junctions. This leads to \"junction hoppers\" who only use the motorway for a short distance before exiting; their difference in speed when entering and leaving the main carriageway causes a domino effect, resulting in all vehicles slowing down. Drivers who only use the M25 to travel a short distance are believed by some to have less overall driving experience, exacerbating traffic and safety issues."]}, {"page": "Derek Bell (racing driver)", "response": ["He was presented with Honorary Life membership of the AA in recognition of his 50 years in motorsport, commemorated by a plaque presented by Lord March at the Moving Motorshow during the 2014 Goodwood Festival of Speed in the presence of Chris Jansen, CEO of the AA, and Edmund King, the president of the AA."]}, {"page": "RAC Foundation", "response": ["The foundation's first director was Edmund King.
