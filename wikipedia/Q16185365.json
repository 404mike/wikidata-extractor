Green had formerly played with Love Affair, The Honeycombs (both of them long after their run of 1960s hits), and Octopus. He was joined in Split Enz by Octopus bassist Nigel Griggs, who replaced Mike Chunn.\nGreen was sacked from Split Enz in 1981 after disagreements with frontman Tim Finn over the rejection of Green's songwriting contributions, and released a non-charting solo single, \"Follow Me.\" He subsequently settled in Sydney, where he produced music at his own home studio. He also drummed for and acted as a mentor to Sydney band Gethsemane.\nIn 2005, Green accepted an invitation to play with Split Enz at its induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame in Australia. In 2006 he rejoined Split Enz for its Australian reunion tour, sharing drumming duties with Noel Crombie. Green did not, however, take part in Split Enz's reunion tour of New Zealand in 2008, during which drumming duties were handled by Michael Barker.\nIn 2014 Green returned to Britain to be closer to his elderly father.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Split Enz", "response": ["To promote the album they toured as support to English folk-rockers Jack the Lad.
