U.S. Advisor on climate change, James Gustave Speth, said: \"I used to think that top environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. I thought that thirty years of good science could address these problems. I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy, and to deal with these we need a cultural and spiritual transformation.\"", "Some in Spiritual Ecology argue that a pervasive patriarchal world-view, and a monotheistic religious orientation towards a transcendent divinity, is largely responsible for destructive attitudes about the earth, body, and the sacred nature of creation.See Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, The Return of the Feminine and the World Soul, ch. 3, \"Patriarchal Deities and the Repression of the Feminine.\" Thus, many identify the wisdom of indigenous cultures, for whom the physical world is still regarded as sacred, as holding a key to our current ecological predicament.", "More recently, leaders in the Engaged Buddhism movement, including Thich Nhat Hanh, also identify a need to return to a sense of self which includes the Earth.Confino, Jo. \"Beyond environment: falling back in love with Mother Earth,\" The Guardian, Feb. 2010. Joanna Macy describes a collective shift \u2013 referred to as the \"Great Turning\" \u2013 taking us into a new consciousness in which the earth is not experienced as separate. Sufi teacher Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee similarly grounds his spiritual ecology work in the context of a collective evolutionary expansion towards oneness, bringing us all toward an experience of earth and humanity \u2013 all life \u2013 as interdependent. In the vision and experience of oneness, the term \"spiritual ecology\" becomes, itself, redundant. What is earth-sustaining is spiritual; that which is spiritual honors a sacred earth.", "An important element in the work of these contemporary teachers is the call for humanity's full acceptance of responsibility for what we have done \u2013 physically and spiritually \u2013 to the earth. Only through accepting responsibility will healing and transformation occur.Also see the video Taking Spiritual Responsibility for the Planet with Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, and Engaged Buddhism", "The Engaged Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh speaks of the importance of mindfulness in taking care of our Mother Earth, and how the highest form of prayer is real communion with the Earth.  Franciscan friar Richard Rohr emphasizes the need to experience the whole world as a divine incarnation. Sufi mystic Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee directs our attention not just to the suffering of the physical world, but also its interior spiritual self, or anima mundi (world soul).
