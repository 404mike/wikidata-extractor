He worked as a reporter on the BBC's Panorama for many years before joining ITN, initially as a reporter but later as a newscaster for ITV's main early evening bulletins in the 1970s. In November 1963, he was deputy correspondent for the BBC in Washington and his Radio Newsreel report on the assassination of John F. Kennedy is a historic recording. Between 1976 and 1987 he was, along with Peter Sissons, one of the main presenters for ITN's News at One, and often hosted the News at 5:45 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He regularly presented News at Ten from October 1967, shortly after its launch, until January 1976.\nParkin was one of the most popular newsreaders ever to work for ITN, and, like his former co-host of the News at 5:45 Michael Nicholson, he became renowned for his cheerful and friendly disposition. He always began the News at One by saying \"hello, good afternoon..\" then reading the headlines. During school holidays, he would also make a point of welcoming younger viewers at the start of the News at One. When he presented News at 5:45 on 24 October 1979, he was the first ITN newscaster to be seen on ITV following the conclusion of the ITV strike of August\u2013October 1979.\nDuring the Falklands War of 1982, Parkin temporarily replaced Michael Nicholson as main presenter of the News at 5:45, and broke to the UK the news that the General Belgrano had been sunk in a controversial incident during the Falklands War. He and Nicholson provided a detailed report of this incident. He left ITN in 1987, returning to his native Yorkshire to make a series of documentaries about the county for Yorkshire Television, entitled Pieces of Parkin.\nA Freemason, he was a member of a Lodge which met at The Cloisters in Letchworth Garden City.\nParkin died of cancer of the spine, in Scarborough, on 20 September 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Sissons", "response": ["Sissons joined ITN in 1964, working his way up to the role of journalist. He was wounded by gunfire whilst covering the Biafran War in 1968, sustaining severe nerve damage in his left leg. After recovering from his injuries, he became ITN's Industrial Editor, covering many high-profile disputes during the 1970s. On 6 September 1976, Sissons joined the list of presenters of ITN's lunchtime ITN News at One bulletin, alternating with Leonard Parkin. He also co-presented ITN's 1983 General Election Night programmes (with Sir Alastair Burnet and Martyn Lewis) and in 1987 (with Burnet and Alastair Stewart)."]}, {"page": "Thurnscoe", "response": ["*Leonard Parkin (1929-1993), Journalist and newscaster on ITN\u2019s News at One and News at 5:45.

The original newscasting team included Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, George Ffitch and Leonard Parkin. News at Ten also employed several other distinctive features which proved popular with viewers: the use of Big Ben's chimes (or \"bongs\") to separate the news headlines being read in the opening sequence, and the \"\u2026 And Finally\" report \u2013 a quirky and often humorous end piece designed to send the viewing audience to bed \"on a high note\" after 30 minutes of hard news coverage.", "*Leonard Parkin (1968\u20131976)"]}, {"page": "ITV Evening News", "response": ["Alastair Burnet was the original presenter of the News at 545.
