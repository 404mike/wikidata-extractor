He regained the number one ranking in 1982, but his form declined thereafter and he dropped out of the elite top-16 ranked players after the 1986\u201387 season. He retired from the professional game in 1991.\nReardon remained one of snooker's top players into his 50s, setting a number of records. He became snooker's oldest World champion (in 1978, aged 45 years and 203 days), and the oldest player to win a ranking event (in 1982, aged 50 years and 14 days). His highest break in competition was 146. He also worked with Ronnie O'Sullivan in a coaching role, helping him to win the 2004 World Snooker Championship.
