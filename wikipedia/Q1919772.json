A highly regarded and famously affable figure of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras he played major investigative roles in cases that led to the establishment and acceptance of fingerprint identification. He was also a major player in the pursuit and capture of Dr. Crippen, and of the exoneration of a wrongly convicted man, Adolph Beck, which helped lead to the creation of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907.\nWhen he prematurely retired in 1913 due to illness, Macnaghten claimed to journalists that he knew the exact identity of Jack the Ripper, the nickname of the unknown serial killer of poor prostitutes in London's impoverished East End during the late Victorian era. The police chief called the killer \"that remarkable man\", but refused to name him or divulge details that might identify him, except to reveal that he had taken his own life at the end of 1888. Macnaghten further claimed that he had destroyed the relevant papers to keep forever secret the deceased killer's identity. Since 1965 the public has known that Macnaghten's suspect was Montague John Druitt, a country doctor's son and young barrister who inexplicably drowned himself in the River Thames in early December 1888. The source of Macnaghten's alleged \"private information\" about Druitt has two candidates, both only uncovered in the early 21st Century. One is a Tory politician, H. R. Farquharson, who lived near the Druitts and also went to Eton with Macnaghten, and the other is Colonel Sir Vivian Majendie, a very close friend of the police chief and whose clan was related to the Druitt family. It is likely both men, in succession, were the unnamed sources of information for the police chief regarding the drowned barrister being strongly suspected of being the Ripper by his closest relations. \nSince 1959 Macnaghten has been known for a major report written in the 1890s on the Ripper case, naming three possible Jack the Ripper suspects. There are two versions of this document, one that was filed in the archives of Scotland Yard. It was, however, a copy of the privately held version in the possession of his daughter, Christabel, Lady Aberconway \u2013 the version which strongly advocated \"M. J. Druitt\" as the likeliest suspect to have been the Whitechapel assassin \u2013 that was revealed in 1959. Macnaghten's opinion that the case was likely solved, and that it was a \"Protean\" maniac who had taken his own life, had already been confirmed in his 1914 memoir, \"Days of My Years\" (London, Edward Arnold) though Druitt was not named (and no other suspects are mentioned as possibilities).\nMore recently, French writer Sophie Herfort has argued that Macnaghten himself was responsible for the Jack the Ripper murders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921", "response": ["** Sir Melville Macnaghten, British police officer (b. 1853)"]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 12 May \u2013 Sir Melville Macnaghten, police officer (born 1853)"]}, {"page": "Jack the Ripper suspects", "response": ["left|60px|Montague John DruittMontague John Druitt (15 August 1857 \u2013 early December 1888) was a Dorset-born barrister who worked to supplement his income as an assistant schoolmaster in Blackheath, London, until his dismissal shortly before his suicide by drowning in 1888.Rumbelow, p. 155 His decomposed body was found floating in the Thames near Chiswick on 31 December 1888. Some modern authors suggest that Druitt may have been dismissed because he was homosexual and that this could have driven him to commit suicide.Marriott, pp. 233\u2013234 However, both his mother and his grandmother suffered mental health problems,Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 260 and it is possible that he was dismissed because of an underlying hereditary psychiatric illness. His death shortly after the last canonical murder (which took place on 9 November 1888) led Assistant Chief Constable Sir Melville Macnaghten to name him as a suspect in a memorandum of 23 February 1894. However, Macnaghten incorrectly described the 31-year-old barrister as a 41-year-old doctor.Fido, p. 203; Marriott, pp. 231\u2013234; Rumbelow, p. 157 On 1 September, the day after the first canonical murder, Druitt was in Dorset playing cricket, and most experts now believe that the killer was local to Whitechapel, whereas Druitt lived miles away on the other side of the Thames in Kent.Marriott, p. 223 Inspector Frederick Abberline appeared to dismiss Druitt as a serious suspect on the basis that the only evidence against him was the coincidental timing of his suicide shortly after the last canonical murder.Interview in the Pall Mall Gazette, 31 March 1903, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 264", "Aaron Kosminski (born Aron Mordke Kozminski; 11 September 1865 \u2013 24 March 1919) was a Polish Jew who was admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum in 1891.Colney Hatch Register of Admissions, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 269 \"Kosminski\" (without a forename) was named as a suspect by Sir Melville Macnaghten in his 1894 memorandumMacnaghten's notes quoted by Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 584\u2013587; Fido, pp. 147\u2013148 and Rumbelow, p. 142 and by former Chief Inspector Donald Swanson in handwritten comments in the margin of his copy of Assistant Commissioner Sir Robert Anderson's memoirs.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 269; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 243; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 635; Rumbelow, p. 179 Anderson wrote that a Polish Jew had been identified as the Ripper but that no prosecution was possible because the witness was also Jewish and refused to testify against a fellow Jew.Quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 266; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 236; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 626\u2013633 and Fido, p. 169 Some authors are sceptical of this, while others use it in their theories.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 276; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 249\u2013253; Rumbelow, p. 182 In his memorandum, Macnaghten stated that no one was ever identified as the Ripper, which directly contradicts Anderson's recollection.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 255 In 1987, author Martin Fido searched asylum records for any inmates called Kosminski, and found only one: Aaron Kosminski. Kosminski lived in Whitechapel;Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 269\u2013270; Marriott, p. 238; Fido, p. 215 however, he was largely harmless in the asylum. His insanity took the form of auditory hallucinations, a paranoid fear of being fed by other people, a refusal to wash or bathe, and \"self-abuse\".Asylum case notes quoted by Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 270 and Fido, pp. 216, 228 In his book The Cases That Haunt Us, former FBI profiler John Douglas states that a paranoid individual such as Kosminski would likely have openly boasted of the murders while incarcerated had he been the killer, but there is no record that he ever did so. In 2014, DNA analysis tenuously linked Kosminski with a shawl said to have belonged to victim Catherine Eddowes, but experts \u2013 including Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, the inventor of genetic fingerprinting \u2013 dismissed the claims as unreliable. In March 2019, the Journal of Forensic Sciences published a study that claimed DNA from Kosminski and Catherine Eddowes was found on the shawl, though other scientists have cast doubt on the study.", "Thomas Hayne Cutbush (1865\u20131903) was a medical student sent to Lambeth Infirmary in 1891 suffering delusions thought to have been caused by syphilis.Rumbelow, pp. 141\u2013142 After stabbing a woman in the backside and attempting to stab a second he was pronounced insane and committed to Broadmoor Hospital in 1891, where he remained until his death in 1903. In a series of articles in 1894, The Sun newspaper suggested that Cutbush was the Ripper. There is no evidence that police took the idea seriously, and Melville Macnaghten's memorandum naming the three police suspects Druitt, Kosminski and Ostrog was written to refute the idea that Cutbush was the Ripper.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 284; Cook, pp. 198\u2013199; Marriott, p. 235; Rumbelow, pp. 141\u2013142; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 105, 110 Cutbush was the suspect advanced in the 1993 book Jack the Myth by A. P. Wolf, who suggested that Macnaghten wrote his memo to protect Cutbush's uncle, a fellow police officer.Quoted in Whitehead and Rivett, p. 110 Another recent writer, Peter Hodgson, considers Cutbush the most likely candidate.Hodgson, Peter Jack the Ripper Through the Mists of Time David Bullock also firmly believes Cutbush to be the real Ripper in his book.Bullock, David The Man Who Would Be Jack: The Hunt for the Real Ripper"]}, {"page": "Mary Jane Kelly", "response": ["Contemporary reports estimated Kelly's height at 5 feet and 7 inches (1.70 metres).

Sir Melville Macnaghten of the Metropolitan Police Force, who never saw Kelly in the flesh, reported that she was known to have \"considerable personal attractions\" by the standards of the time. The Daily Telegraph of 10 November 1888 described her as \"tall, slim, fair, of fresh complexion, and of attractive appearance\".Evans and Skinner, p. 336"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Stride", "response": ["As two other murders (those of Mary Ann Nichols and Annie Chapman) had occurred in the districts of Whitechapel and Spitalfields\u2014both of which had been initially caused by knife wounds to the throat\u2014within the previous month, Stride's murder was added to the Whitechapel murders investigation, and was widely believed to have been perpetrated by the same killer. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the other canonical murdersSee for example Stewart, William (1939), Jack the Ripper: A New Theory, Quality Press, quoted in Evans and Skinner 2000, p. 418 This opinion is upon the basis that the body had not been subjected to any mutilation and that this murder was the only murder ascribed to Jack the Ripper to occur south of Whitechapel Road.Marriott, p. 124 Furthermore, it is believed that the blade used to cause the wound to Stride's neck may have been shorter and of a different design than that used to murder and subsequently mutilate the other four canonical murder victims.Cook, p. 157; Marriott, p. 125; Woods and Baddeley, p. 86 Most experts, however, consider the similarities in this case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with the two earlier Ripper murders, in addition to the murder of Catherine Eddowes later that same night.e.g. Melville Macnaghten quoted by Cook, p. 151; Evans and Skinner 2000, pp. 584\u2013587 and Rumbelow, p. 140; Thomas Bond (British physician) quoted in Evans and Skinner 2000, pp. 360\u2013362 and Rumbelow, pp. 145\u2013147"]}, {"page": "Martha Tabram", "response": ["The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect her death with the later five murders.In an interview reported in the Pall Mall Gazette, 24 March 1903, Inspector Frederick Abberline referred to \"George-yard, Whitechapel-road, where the first murder was committed\" (quoted in Begg, p. 56). Walter Dew wrote in his memoirs, that \"there can be no doubt that the August Bank Holiday murder\u00a0... was the handiwork of the Ripper\" (I Caught Crippen, p. 97, quoted in Begg, p. 56). In his memoirs, Assistant Commissioner Robert Anderson said the second murder occurred on 31 August (quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 632). Later students of the Ripper murders have largely excluded Tabram from the list of Ripper victims, chiefly because her throat was not cut in the manner of later victims, nor was she eviscerated.Marriott, p. 13 This view was advanced by Sir Melville Macnaghten, Assistant Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police Service Criminal Investigation Department, who implied that Tabram was murdered by an unidentified soldier or soldiers in an 1894 memorandum on the murders.Fido, p. 152 Dr Killeen, who performed the post mortem on Tabram, strengthened this belief with his opinion that two weapons were used\u2014one of Tabram's wounds, which penetrated the chest bone, was inflicted with a weapon longer and stouter than the others, a dagger or possibly a bayonet, while the others were inflicted with a shorter, slimmer knife.Cook, p. 218", "Sir Melville Macnaghten was only actively involved in the Whitechapel murders investigation between 1889 and 1891; thus, his notes reflect only the opinions of some police officers at the time, and include several factual errors in the information presented pertaining to possible suspects. Serial killers have been known to have changed their murder weapons, but especially to develop their modus operandi over time, as the Ripper did with increasingly severe mutilations. While the five canonical Ripper murders were located roughly to north, south, east and west of Whitechapel, Tabram's murder occurred close to their geographic centre.

Macnaghten, however, thought that Montague Druitt was more likely to be the killer, and he did not mention anything about any alleged identification of Kosminski that had been withdrawn by a witness. That was strange because Macnaghten was an Assistant Chief Constable in the Criminal Investigation Department and Anderson was in charge of that department. Aaron Kosminski was sent to Colney Hatch Asylum, via the Mile End Old Town asylum, in February 1891, and we may suppose that the identification at the \"seaside home\" took place a little earlier, perhaps in January of that year. Macnaghten went to Scotland Yard in 1889 and so would have been there when the identification took place, if it did indeed involve Aaron Kosminski. Quite obviously he was not told about it and, if Anderson was confident that Kosminski had been the Ripper, he would have thought that there was no reason for Macnaghten to compile his memorandum, speculating about the Ripper's identity. Of the three men suspected at the time of the murders, Macnaghten thought Druitt was the most likely but in 1972, two years before she died, Macnaghten's daughter Christabel, Lady Aberconway, told her friend Michael Thornton that in nominating Druitt her father was \"only following the official line.
