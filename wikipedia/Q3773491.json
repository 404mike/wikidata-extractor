Cullen presented a new theory and methodology for urban visual analysis and design based on the psychology of perception, such as on the human need for visual stimulation and the notions of time and space. He is best known for the book Townscape, first published in 1961. Later editions of Townscape  were published under the title The Concise Townscape.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Theories of urban planning", "response": ["* The Concise Townscape, Gordon Cullen, 1961"]}, {"page": "Urban design", "response": ["Urban design theory deals primarily with the design and management of public space (i.e. the 'public environment', 'public realm' or 'public domain'), and the way public places are used and experienced. Public space includes the totality of spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public, such as streets, plazas, parks, and public infrastructure.  Some aspects of privately owned spaces, such as building facades or domestic gardens, also contribute to public space and are therefore also considered by urban design theory. Important writers on urban design theory include Christopher Alexander, Peter Calthorpe, Gordon Cullen, Andres Duany, Jane Jacobs, Jan Gehl, Allan B. Jacobs, Kevin Lynch, Aldo Rossi, Colin Rowe, Robert Venturi, William H. Whyte, Camillo Sitte, Bill Hillier (Space syntax), and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk.", "In 1956, the term\u00a0 \u201cUrban design\u201d was first used at a series of conferences hosted by Harvard University.

The program also utilized the writings of famous urban planning thinkers: Gordon Cullen, Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch, and Christopher Alexander.", "In 1961, Gordon Cullen published The Concise Townscape. He examined the traditional artistic approach to city design of theorists including Camillo Sitte, Barry Parker, and Raymond Unwin. Cullen also created the concept of 'serial vision'. It defined the urban landscape as a series of related spaces."]}, {"page": "Festival of Britain", "response": ["Lettering and type design featured prominently in the graphic style of the Festival and was overseen by a typography panel including the lettering historian Nicolete Gray. A typeface for the Festival, Festival Titling, was specially commissioned and designed by Philip Boydell. It was based on condensed sans-serif capitals and had a three-dimensional form making it suitable for use in exhibition display typography.Berry, W.T., Johnson, A.F., and Jaspert, W.P., The Encyclopaedia of Type Faces, London: Blandford Press, 1963 It has been said to bear \"a vague resemblance to bunting\". The lettering on the Royal Festival Hall and the temporary Festival building on the South Bank was a bold, sloping slab serif letter form, determined by Gray and her colleagues, including Charles Hasler and Gordon Cullen, illustrated in Gray's Lettering on Buildings (1960) and derived in part from typefaces used in the early 19th century. It has been described as a \"turn to a jauntier and more decorative visual language\" that was \"part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture\". The lettering in the Lion and Unicorn Pavilion was designed by John Brinkley.Alex Seago, Burning the Box of Beautiful Things: The Development of Post-Modern Sensibility, Oxford University Press, 1995John Lewis and John Brinkley, Graphic Design, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1954"]}, {"page": "Wraysbury", "response": ["Former actor Robert Rietti had a home in Wraysbury, but after his wife died in August 2008, he sold the house in 2009.

It is one of only a few buildings he designed which were actually built. The main store in the village was Wraysbury Stores until its closure in May 2006. The building is Victorian and had been continuously occupied since the late 1800s. It was formerly a post office before becoming a general store. Its neighbours include a garage and fish and chip shop and is opposite the Perseverance pub. There are many shops located on the High Street, and there is also a park including a children's playground which is a popular spot for dog-walkers and kite-flyers. 1st Wraysbury Scouts Group is based on the village green.
