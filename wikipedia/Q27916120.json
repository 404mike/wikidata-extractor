Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it, but, in England at least, a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it, than of any other of the customary abuses of force: for its motive was the love of gain, unmixed and undisguised: and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country, while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it, was unmitigated abhorrence."]}, {"page": "Autosport BRDC Award", "response": ["| Westley BarberAdam CarrollDan EaglingChristian EnglandDanny Watts"]}, {"page": "United Autosports", "response": ["United Autosports made the team's d\u00e9but in the European Le Mans Series at Silverstone in April with a pair of Ligier JS P3 sports cars and drivers Alex Brundle, Mike Guasch, Christian England, Mark Patterson, Wayne Boyd and Matt Bell.
