He turned professional in 1969 and played on the European Tour from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. He never won a European Tour event, but he finished second four occasions, with one being a defeat in a matchplay final, and twice losing out in a playoff. His best finish on the European Tour Order of Merit was 20th in 1988. In 1985 he won the PLM Open, which became a European Tour event the following season, and he was twice the British Club Professional Champion.\nDurnian played in The Open Championship every year from 1982 to 1990, only making the 36-hole cut on one occasion, in 1983 at Royal Birkdale, when he went on to finish tied for 8th place. During the second round he set the record for the lowest nine-hole total in the Open, with 28 on the front nine.After turning fifty Durnian joined the European Seniors Tour. He has won three tournaments at that level and was second on the end of season Order of Merit in both 2001 and 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bob Charles (golfer)", "response": ["| Brian Barnes,  Denis Durnian, Nick Job"]}, {"page": "Seve Ballesteros", "response": ["| Denis Durnian"]}, {"page": "Nick Faldo", "response": ["| Denis Durnian,  Wayne Riley"]}, {"page": "Tommy Horton", "response": ["| Denis Durnian,  Anders Starkman"]}, {"page": "Open de France", "response": ["| 1988 ||  Nick Faldo (2) || align=center|274 || align=center|\u22126 || 2 strokes ||  Denis Durnian Wayne Riley || Chantilly"]}, {"page": "David Frost (golfer)", "response": ["| Denis Durnian"]}, {"page": "Brian Barnes (golfer)", "response": ["| Bob Charles,  Denis Durnian, Nick Job", "| Bob Charles,  Denis Durnian, Nick Job"]}, {"page": "Eamonn Darcy", "response": ["| Denis Durnian"]}, {"page": "UBS Cup", "response": ["*  Denis Durnian 2001, 2002"]}, {"page": "Christy O'Connor Jnr", "response": ["He would build on this success, finishing in the top 30 of the Order of Merit every year, until winning the 1989 Jersey Open.
