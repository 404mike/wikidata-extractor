He was born on 4 June 1738 and was educated by Rev. Matthew Bloxam, vicar of Overbury and  Rev. James Graham, of  Hackney. On leaving school he entered the family banking house. He married  Penelope Skipp, daughter  of Joseph Skipp of Upper Hall, Ledbury, Herefordshire on 17 February 1774.Martin was elected Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury in a by-election on 8 April 1776 following the death of his brother Joseph. He acquired a reputation for his scrupulously independent attitude. Wraxall described him as 'one of the most conscientious and honest men who ever sat in Parliament'.  His strong religious views\u2014tending to unitarianism and firmly anti-clerical\u2014led him to press for a number of humanitarian reforms: he spoke often against the slave trade and the press gang, and for some mitigation in the penal code. On political questions he took a radical line, advocating economical and parliamentary reform. A diffident and portentous speaker, his frequent protestations of independence bored the House, and he was not always well heard. He expounded his creed: Whoever may be in power will be unsolicited by me for place or emoluments ... I should as soon think of lurking in the avenues of the House as a petty pilferer, as I would barter the interests of the public or my constituents for anything a minister could grant me, or for any private advantage or emolument whatever. Ambition, Sir, as the word is generally understood, is entirely out of my line of life; but, Sir, I own I have an ambition, and of which I am not ashamed; it is to be an honest, independent, useful Member of Parliament. After this he intervened frequently in debate, though he admitted later that he 'never rose to speak in the House without great awe and embarrassment'.Martin was returned unopposed for Tewkesbury in the 1780 general election. He acquired the nickname Starling Martin after condemning  Fox's India bill on 1 December 1783 as 'pernicious and unconstitutional', and wished there were a starling to perch on the Speaker's chair and repeat incessantly 'disgraceful, shameless Coalition'. Lord North responded a few days later :\u201cIt had been said on a former day that a starling ought to be brought, placed in this House, and taught to speak the words 'Coalition! Coalition! cursed Coalition'. Now, for my part, I think that while there is in this House an honourable gentleman who never fails, let what will be the subject of debate, to take an opportunity to curse the Coalition, I think there will be no occasion for the starling; and while he continues to speak by rote, and without any fixed idea, I think what he says will make just as much impression as if the starling himself was to utter his words.\u201d It was said that here the House could scarcely give the noble lord an opportunity to proceed, they fell into so violent a fit of laughter. The immoderate response to a pleasant witticism suggests that Martin was already regarded as a ludicrous figure: indeed, a few weeks later, he referred to himself wryly as the deputy-starling.  His extreme portliness made him conspicuous, and his behaviour was often eccentric. Though there was a contest at Tewkesbury at the 1784 general election, Martin's seat was not in danger. He returned to Westminster to pursue his old vendettas against Lord North and the encroachments of the peers.\nBy 1790, Martin was head of the family bank in London and continued to sit for Tewkesbury on their interest. He was returned unopposed in  1790 but there was a contest in  1796. He was returned unopposed in  1802. He was considering retiring before the next election, but in  1806 he stood again and was returned unopposed. He was granted three weeks' leave because of ill health on 10 March 1807. He retired at the subsequent dissolution to make way for his eldest son John who was beaten at the polls in the 1807,.Shortly afterwards Martin retired from the bank. On 1 February 1808, now 'old and infirm', he agreed to sign Wyvill's petition for religious toleration, being to the last 'a most hearty advocate for civil and religious liberty to its utmost extent'. He died on 26 January 1810.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Martin", "response": ["*James Martin (Scottish actor) (born 1931), Scottish actor on Still Game", "*James Martin (attorney), U.S. Attorney in Missouri", "*James Martin II (1826\u20131918), American Medal of Honor recipient", "*James Martin (1738\u20131810), British banker and politician who sat in the House of Commons for 31 years from 1776 to 1807", "*James Martin (1807\u20131878), British Liberal Party politician and banker ", "*James Martin (Australian politician) (1820\u20131886), Premier of New South Wales", "*James Martin (South Australian politician) (1821\u20131899), engineer and politician of Gawler, South Australia", "*James Martin (New South Wales politician) (1850\u20131898), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for South Sydney and Sydney-Bligh", "*James Martin (trade unionist) (1850\u20131933), British trade unionist and politician", "*James Martin (Irish politician) (1905\u20131969), Fianna F\u00e1il Senator from 1965 to 1969", "*James Martin (Maine politician) (born 1965), member of the Maine House of Representatives", "*James Martin (mayor), Republican mayor of Ansonia, Connecticut, 1969\u20131971", "*James Martin (South Carolina politician) (died 1868), member of the South Carolina House of Representatives", "*James Martin (Queensland politician) (born 1981), Queensland politician (elected 2021)", "*James Martin (priest, born 1960), American Jesuit priest and writer", "*James Martin (cricketer) (1851\u20131930), Australian cricketer", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131940), Scottish footballer", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u20131969), English footballer", "*James Martin (American football) (born 1944), head college football coach at Tuskegee University", "*James Martin (rugby league) (born 1987), British rugby player", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1994) (born 1994), Scottish footballer", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1998), English footballer", "*James Martin (philosopher) (fl. 1577), Scottish writer", "*James Martin (convict) (c. 1760\u2013?), convict transported to New South Wales, author of the only extant First Fleet convict account of life in the colony", "*James Martin (author) (1933\u20132013), computer systems design author, writer", "*Sir James Martin (engineer) (1893\u20131981), inventor of the modern aircraft ejection seat", "*James Martin (chef) (born 1972), British celebrity chef", "*James Martin (photographer), American photojournalist", "*James Martin & Co, Australian engineering firm", "*James Martin House (disambiguation)", "*Martin High School (Arlington, Texas), also known as James Martin High School"]}, {"page": "James Martin (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Martin (1738\u20131810)"]}, {"page": "James Martin (1738-1810)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Martin (1738\u20131810)"]}, {"page": "Tewkesbury Town Hall", "response": ["Works of art in the town hall include a portrait by Nathaniel Dance-Holland of Sir William Codrington, and a portrait by George Romney of the local member of parliament, James Martin."]}]}}
