He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying descriptions of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble.Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, p. 30 Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept \u00c6thelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine.Keynes, \"England, c. 900\u20131016\", p. 467; Abels, Alfred the Great, p. 307 However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that \u00c6thelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife.Yorke, \"Edward as \u00c6theling\", pp. 26, 33; Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, pp. 29\u201331 She may have been related to St Dunstan.Yorke, Bishop \u00c6thelwold: His Career and Influence, pp.\u00a066\u201367", "Edward married his second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, at about the time of his father's death, probably because Ecgwynn had died, although she may have been put aside. The new marriage weakened \u00c6thelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, \u00c6lfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting \u00c6lffl\u00e6d aside.Williams, \"\u00c6lffl\u00e6d\"; Miller, \"Edward the Elder\" Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred.

She may have been related to St Dunstan, the aristocratic tenth-century Archbishop of Canterbury. But William of Malmesbury also stated that \u00c6thelstan's accession in 924 was opposed by a nobleman who claimed that his mother was a concubine of low birth. The suggestion that Ecgwynn was Edward's mistress is accepted by some historians such as Simon Keynes and Richard Abels, but Yorke and \u00c6thelstan's biographer, Sarah Foot, disagree, arguing that the allegations should be seen in the context of the disputed succession in 924, and were not an issue in the 890s.
