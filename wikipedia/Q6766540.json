Six minutes elapsed before the Strikers got another chance to counterattack, but after Darnell King raced down the left side his pass into the box was just out of reach of Mark Anderson and the scorebook remained closed for the time being.

In the 62nd minute the Strikers nearly went ahead through a long-range effort by Shawn Chin, but Saunders was on the spot and dived low to make the save.  On the rebound the Strikers were awarded a penalty kick after Anderson was brought down in the box.
