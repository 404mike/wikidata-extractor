Len Langford had made over 100 appearances and had appeared in the 1933 FA Cup Final, which City lost 3\u20130 to Everton. He missed the final game of the 1932\u201333 season and the opening match of 1933\u201334, but went on to play 18 consecutive League games before injury on 16 December 1933 ended his time as City's first choice. Langford's replacement for the following game was James Nicholls, but he endured a torrid time as Manchester City lost 8\u20130 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Consequently, Swift was given an opportunity for the Christmas double-header against Derby County. He conceded four goals in his debut at the Baseball Ground on 25 December, but in the return match the next day, his 20th birthday, he kept a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 win. After making his debut, Swift played in every first team match for more than four seasons, a run of more than 200 consecutive matches. His only absence prior to the suspension of football due to World War II was a single match in September 1938, where without Swift, Manchester City lost 6\u20131 at home to Millwall.James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p. 354."]}, {"page": "Manchester derby", "response": ["!scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| Len Langford"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Len Langford||  || Goalkeeper || 1930\u20131933||125||0|| ||"]}, {"page": "Alfred Chalkley", "response": ["Chalkley signed professional forms with West Ham in 1931 after impressing in a trial game and played 29 games of the 1931\u201332 season.
