They married in late 1873 and lived together on Nagi Island (also known as Naghir or Mount Ernest Island) where Jardine continued his pearl shell business and built a family home. In 1877 this house burnt down with much of the Jardines' personal possessions. Fortunately for them, the government in that same year had decided to move its base of Torres Strait operations from Somerset to Thursday Island and approached Frank Jardine with the offer to purchase the old site at Cape York. He accepted and the Premier of Queensland, John Douglas, noted that Jardine would also be able to protect British interests in the area from the remnant Yadhaigana people who still offered resistance to colonisation."]}, {"page": "Vaiee", "response": ["The village is situated in the Safata subdistrict of the larger Tuamasaga district. To the West it is bordered by Niusuatia, and to the East by Fusi Safata. The village of Vaiee is known for many activities and sports such as Samoan Cricket and Rugby. The village is predominantly Christian and has only one established and recognized denomination, being the Ekalesia Faapotopotoga Kerisiano o Samoa (CCCS). The church was founded in 1843 by the LMS Missionary Rev. George Turner and the people of Vaiee Safata, the same Rev. Turner who went on to establish and run the Malua Theological College. The village has a tapu or taboo on other denominations besides the EFKS/CCCS being formally established within the village. However, a handful of the village belong to other denominations outside the village such as Catholicism, Mormonism, Evangelical Christian Churches and others.

On Upolu he took as wife the daughter of Tui-a-Ana. Now, most Samoan lore agrees that Pili's sons were in order of birth Tua (founder of Atua), Ana (founder of Aana), Saga (founder of Tua-ma-Saga), and Tolufale (founder of Manono and Sapapalii). This suggests that Pili may have taken to wife his own granddaughter, not unlike the custom of Egyptian pharaohs."]}, {"page": "Tui Fiti", "response": ["The missionary George Turner wrote in Samoa, a Hundred Years Ago and Long Before (1884) that Tuifiti was the name of a village god in Savai'i who appeared as a man who walked about but was never visible to the people of the place.
