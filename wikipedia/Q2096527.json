He painted in a flat, stately style, and was influenced by French Symbolism.  He also worked in stained glass, most probably learning from his father, Edward Frampton, who was a stained-glass artist. His work usually depicted symbolic subjects and landscapes; early in his career he made sculpture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elaine of Astolat", "response": ["Elaine has captured the minds of many artists, becoming one of the most recognizable tertiary characters from the Arthurian legends.
