He painted in a flat, stately style, and was influenced by French Symbolism.  He also worked in stained glass, most probably learning from his father, Edward Frampton, who was a stained-glass artist. His work usually depicted symbolic subjects and landscapes; early in his career he made sculpture.", "link_mentions": {}}}
