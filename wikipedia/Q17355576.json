There was no co-ordination or central direction on the Commune side; each neighborhood fought on its own. The National Guard disintegrated, with many soldiers changing into civilian clothes and fleeing the city, leaving between 10,000 and 15,000 Communards to defend the barricades. Delescluze moved his headquarters from the Hotel de Ville to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement. More public buildings were set afire, including the Palais de Justice, the Prefecture de Police, the theatres of Ch\u00e2telet and Porte-Saint-Martin, and the Church of Saint-Eustache. Most of the Palais de Justice was destroyed, but the Sainte-Chapelle survived. Fires set at the Louvre, Palais-Royal and Notre-Dame were extinguished without causing significant damage.The Paris Commune 1871, Robert Tombs, p.11", "In 1876 Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, who had fought on the barricades during Bloody Week, and had gone into exile in London, wrote a highly popular and sympathetic history of the Commune. At the end, he wrote: \"No one knows the exact number of victims of the Bloody Week. The chief of the military justice department claimed seventeen thousand shot.\"  This was inaccurate; Appert made no such claim, he referred only to prisoners.  \"The municipal council of Paris,\" Lissagaray continued, \"paid for the burial of seventeen thousand bodies; but a large number of persons were killed or cremated outside of Paris.\" Later historians, including Robert Tombs, could not find the source Lissagaray cited for the city payment for seventeen thousand burials, and Lissagaray provided no evidence that thousands of Communards were cremated or buried outside Paris. \"It is no exaggeration,\" Lissagaray concluded, \"to say twenty thousand, a number admitted by the officers.\"Lissagaray, Prosper-Olivier (1876), Histoire de la Commune de 1871, La Decouverte/Poche (2000). p. 383  But neither MacMahon or Appert had \"admitted\" that twenty thousand were killed, they both said the number was exaggerated.", "Between 1878 and 1880, a French historian and member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, Maxime Du Camp, wrote a new history . Du Camp had witnessed the last days of the Commune, went inside the Tuileries Palace shortly after the fires were put out, witnessed the executions of Communards by soldiers, and the bodies in the streets. He studied the question of the number of dead, and studied the records of the office of inspection of the Paris cemeteries, which was in charge of burying the dead. Based on their records, he reported that between 20 and 30 May, 5,339 Communard corpses had been taken from the streets or Paris morgue to the city cemeteries for burial. Between 24 May and 6 September, the office of inspection of cemeteries reported that an additional 1,328 corpses were exhumed from temporary graves at 48 sites, including 754 corpses inside the old quarries near Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, for a total of 6,667.du Camp, Maxime, Les Convulsions de Paris, Hachette, (1881), p. 303. Marxist critics attacked du Camp and his book; Collette Wilson called it \"a key text in the construction and promulgation of the reactionary memory of the Commune\" and Paul Lidsky called it \"the bible of the anti-Communard literature.\" In 2012, however, historian Robert Tombs made a new study of the Paris cemetery records and placed the number killed between 6,000 and 7,000, confirming du Camp's research. Jacques Rougerie, who had earlier accepted the 20,000 figure, wrote in 2014, \"the number ten thousand victims seems today the most plausible; it remains an enormous number for the time.\"", "Edwin Child, a young Londoner working in Paris, noted that during the Commune, \"the women behaved like tigresses, throwing petroleum everywhere and distinguishing themselves by the fury with which they fought\".Eye-witness accounts quoted in 'Paris under Siege' by Joanna Richardson p.197 (see bibliography) However, it has been argued in recent research that these famous female arsonists of the Commune, or , may have been exaggerated or a myth.Robert Tombs, The War Against Paris: 1871, Cambridge University Press, 1981, 272 pages Gay Gullickson, Unruly Women of Paris, Cornell Univ Press, 1996, 304 pages  Lissagaray claimed that because of this myth, hundreds of working-class women were murdered in Paris in late May, falsely accused of being , but he offered no evidence to support his claim. Lissagaray also claimed that the artillery fire by the French army was responsible for probably half of the fires that consumed the city during the Bloody Week. However, photographs of the ruins of the Tuileries Palace, the Hotel de Ville, and other prominent government buildings that burned show that the exteriors were untouched by cannon fire, while the interiors were completely gutted by fire; and prominent Communards such as Jules Bergeret, who escaped to live in New York, proudly claimed credit for the most famous acts of arson."]}, {"page": "Adolphe Thiers", "response": ["He was also a notable popular historian.

It is now believed that the buildings destroyed at the end of the Commune were not burned down by p\u00e9troleuses but were largely caused by Versailles cannon fire. The H\u00f4tel de Ville, the Palais de Justice, the Tuileries Palace and other government buildings and symbols of authority were burned by Commune forces as they retreated. Other fires were started by Communard forces, as a tactic to push back Versailles' troops if ground was lost. Some buildings along the Rue de Rivoli were burned down during street-fighting between Communards and Versaillais troops. Gullickson suggests that the myth of the p\u00e9troleuses was part of a propaganda campaign by Versaillais politicians, who portrayed Parisian women in the Commune as unnatural, destructive, and barbaric, giving loyalist forces a moral victory over the \"unnatural\" Communards.", "* Robert Tombs, The War Against Paris: 1871, Cambridge University Press, 1981, 272 pages "]}, {"page": "Criticism of Wikipedia", "response": ["In November 2021, the English Wikipedia's entry for \"Mass killings under communist regimes\" was nominated for deletion, with some editors arguing that it has \"a biased 'anti-Communist' point of view\", that \"it should not resort to 'simplistic presuppositions that events are driven by any specific ideology\", and that \"by combining different elements of research to create a 'synthesis', this constitutes original research and therefore breaches Wikipedia rules.\" This was criticized by historian Robert Tombs, who called it \"morally indefensible, at least as bad as Holocaust denial, because 'linking ideology and killing' is the very core of why these things are important.
