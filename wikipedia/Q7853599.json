The first Test was a dull and even draw on a pitch that Wisden said was \"devoid of life\": Deane made 29 out of 44 in his only innings in the game. The second Test at Lord's was also drawn, but was a much more exciting game in which the South Africans, having matched England in the first innings, were saved from what Wisden saw as likely defeat by bad light in the second innings; Deane failed in both innings. Depleted by injuries, the South Africans were beaten in the third Test despite a last-wicket stand of 103 between Tuppy Owen-Smith and Sandy Bell, with Deane again making little impression as a batsman, and the fourth Test was a heavier defeat, with England losing only seven wickets and winning by an innings. With the series now lost, Deane came into better form himself, making his only century of the tour, an unbeaten 133, in the game against Hampshire, scoring his runs in 140 minutes. That innings led to him batting at No 5 in the fifth and final Test; in South Africa's only innings of the match, he came to the wicket to join Herby Taylor with the score at 25 for three, and the pair added 214 in 190 minutes before Deane was out for 93, his best Test innings; the game finished as a draw. Wisden wrote: \"The batting of both men reached a very high standard and, coming as it did in such circumstances, was easily the best in point of class and skill shown by the South Africans in the whole series of Tests.\" Deane finished the tour with 1239 first-class runs and an average of 34.41."]}, {"page": "Sandy Bell", "response": ["Injuries before the second Test to the bowlers Neville Quinn and Cyril Vincent, however, meant that he was called up for the game at Lord's. He took his opportunity: in England's first innings, following an early three-wicket burst by Denys Morkel, and then a fourth wicket for the same player, Bell took the remaining six wickets at a cost of 99 runs. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that Bell \"maintained an excellent length and owed most of his success to his ability to make the ball swerve\". The bowling analysis remained the best of Bell's Test career. He was not able to maintain that form, failing to take a wicket in England's second innings. But the performance, and the team's worsening injury crisis, meant he retained his place in the team for the third Test, played at Headingley. In this match, he was not successful with his bowling, but he made instead an unexpected impact with the bat: in South Africa's second innings, he came in at No 11, his customary place in the batting order, with the score on 172 for nine, a lead of only 80. He and Tuppy Owen-Smith, who made 129, then proceeded to add 103 runs for the final wicket in 65 minutes, with Bell's share an unbeaten 26, which remained his highest Test innings. The partnership was South Africa's highest for the 10th wicket and remained the record until beaten by AB de Villiers and Morne Morkel in 2010\u201311. Bell retained his place for the fourth match in the series, but was successful with neither ball nor bat and, after a heavy defeat for the South African team which settled the rubber in favour of England, he was dropped for the final game. In all first-class matches on the tour he took 61 wickets at an average of 27.83."]}, {"page": "List of Middlesex County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Tuppy Owen-Smith (1935\u20131937) : H.
