These definitions, then, effectively preclude reciprocity and are constructed here in such a way as to prevent the possibility of consent.

Morland critically analyses the legacy of psychologist and sexologist John Money, including his development of gender identity as a concept, and the utilization of scientific theories about the plasticity of human nature to develop controversial but still widespread treatment protocols for the management of intersex conditions. Fuckology is co-authored with Lisa Downing and Nikki Sullivan, and published by University of Chicago Press in 2014. A chapter on \"Gender, Genitals, and the Meaning of Being Human\" includes material previously published as \"Plastic Man: Intersex, Humanism and the Reimer Case\" in 2007. New Scientist described the book as \"ably capturing\" Money's story while Susan Stryker described the book as a \"careful, critical and nuanced\" analysis of Money's career."]}]}}
