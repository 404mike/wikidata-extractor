After forty years running his family's pottery business, he set up his own pottery studio in Stoke-on-Trent in 1905 where he made art pottery with the help of a few assistants. After closing the studio in 1915, he worked as a ceramic consultant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dora Billington", "response": ["Dora Billington was born into a family of potters in Stoke-on-Trent, specifically Tunstall. From 1905 to 1910 she attended Tunstall School of Art and later Hanley School of Art, becoming a teacher assistant in her final year. She worked as a decorator for Bernard Moore, 1910-1912 and then studied at the Royal College of Art (RCA) 1912-1916 and the Slade School of Art.John Farleigh, The Creative Craftsman, London: G.Bell & Sons, 1950 At the RCA she studied in the design department under W. R. Lethaby and was taught calligraphy by Edward Johnston, embroidery by Grace Christie and pottery by Richard Lunn. Billington remained an amateur embroiderer and an occasional writer on textiles. Lunn died in 1915 at the age of about 75 and Billington was asked to take over his class with John Adams (who later ran the Poole Pottery). She taught pottery at the Central School of Arts and Crafts from 1919 and left the RCA in 1925 when William Rothenstein appointed William Staite Murray as pottery instructor. The circumstances of her leaving remain somewhat unclear. By that date Rothenstein had been in place for five years, and although he supported Billington's work he criticised the teaching of pottery and other crafts as \"too unexperimental and derivative. No consistent attempt appears to have been made to deal with the interpretation of the contemporary world in design and execution... the research work towards the discovery of new subject matter and new treatment, so noticeable on the Continent, seem to have been wanting.\"Colman, including Rothenstein quote"]}, {"page": "Art pottery", "response": ["Victoria Bergesen groups the wares into broad stylistic groups. Firstly came stonewares and earthenwares that were initially strongly influenced by historical styles. Then there were painted wares that related to the Aesthetic Movement, and overlapped with amateur china painting.  Another group made wares with a rural, folk art,   style, often in very small potteries; this perhaps survived the longest, and from the 20th century is often called \"craft pottery\".  Another group was interested in advanced glaze effects, whether trying to recreate historic Asian ones such as sang de boeuf glaze (for example Bernard Moore), or new experimental ones such as the still radioactive orange uranium glazes.Bergesen, 213, 224 on uranium glazes by Pilkington's Lancastrian Pottery & Tiles  Then came another wave of hand-painting, but less realist, and more geometric and stylized.  This style greatly influenced industrial wares after World War I.Bergesen, 213"]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Bernard Moore (1850\u20131935), pottery manufacturer and ceramic chemist."]}, {"page": "Bernard Moore", "response": ["Bernard Moore may refer to:", "* Bernard Moore (poet) (1873\u20131953), British poet", "* Bernard Moore (burgess), sometime member of the Virginia House of Burgesses", "* Bernard Moore (potter) (1850\u20131935)", "* Bernard Moore (footballer) (1923\u20132014), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Sang de boeuf glaze", "response": ["In England the Ruskin Pottery in Smethwick achieved a glaze around 1900; all their formulas were deliberately destroyed when the pottery closed in 1935.Petrie and Livingstone, 99 Another English art pottery which produced sang de boeuf was that of Bernard Moore.
