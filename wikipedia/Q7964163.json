He became a professional in 1899 with Sheffield United and made four appearances in the First Division of the Football League over the next two years. Anderson was transferred to Second Division side Woolwich Arsenal in December 1901. He made his first team debut against Preston North End in a 0\u20130 draw on 11 January 1902 and scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 win at Chesterfield Town three weeks later. Having formed a partnership in the team's forward line with Bill Gooing, Anderson scored five goals in 13 league games as the club finished fifth in the Second Division table. The following season, he competed with Tim Coleman for a place in the team. Anderson scored five league goals in 15 matches that season and one in the FA Cup, a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Sheffield United, taking his overall tally to 11 goals in 30 appearances.Anderson was transferred to Southern League club Plymouth Argyle in the summer of 1903.
