The film-maker Tony Palmer thought that Tippett's temporary ascendancy might have been a question of the two composers' contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during the final years of the 20th century. Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as \"inimitable, possessed of\u00a0... a voice and sound too dangerous to imitate\". Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became \"a phenomenal father-figure\". Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: \"He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture in the second half of the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate.\""]}, {"page": "Pierre Boulez", "response": ["Boulez's ear for sound was legendary: \"there are countless stories of him detecting, for example, faulty intonation from the third oboe in a complex orchestral texture,\" Paul Griffiths wrote in The New York Times.

After Britten's own death in 1976, the artistic direction of the Festival was shared; many world-class musicians joined the artistic team, including at various times Philip Ledger, Colin Graham, Steuart Bedford, Mstislav Rostropovich, Murray Perahia, Simon Rattle, John Shirley-Quirk and Oliver Knussen.

Comparison of Green (for orchestra, 1967) and A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden (1977) quickly reveals the seeds of this change. The latter was composed according to a pre-compositional scheme, in which pentatonic modes were superimposed over one central pentatonic scale (the so-called \"black-key pentatonic\") around a central sustained central pitch (F-sharp), and an approach that is highly indicative of the sort of \"pantonal\" and modal pitch material seen gradually emerging in his works throughout the 1970s.Burt, 170. The former, Green (or November Steps II) written 10 years earlier, is heavily influenced by Debussy,Takemitsu, \"Notes on November Steps\", Confronting Silence, 83Anderson, Julian, liner notes to Toru Takemitsu, Arc/Green, performed by London Sinfonietta/Oliver Knussen/Rolf Hind, SINF CD3-2006. and is, in spite of its very dissonant language (including momentary quarter-tone clusters), largely constructed through a complex web of modal forms. These modal forms are largely audible, particularly in the momentary repose toward the end of the work.Burt, 118\u2013124 Thus in these works, it is possible to see both a continuity of approach, and the emergence of a simpler harmonic language that was to characterise the work of his later period.", "Takemitsu's sensitivity to instrumental and orchestral timbre can be heard throughout his work, and is often made apparent by the unusual instrumental combinations he specified. This is evident in works such as November Steps, that combine traditional Japanese instruments, shakuhachi and biwa, with a conventional Western orchestra. It may also be discerned in his works for ensembles that make no use of traditional instruments, for example Quotation of Dream (1991), Archipelago S., for 21 players (1993), and Arc\u00a0I & II (1963\u201366/1976). In these works, the more conventional orchestral forces are divided into unconventional \"groups\". Even where these instrumental combinations were determined by the particular ensemble commissioning the work, \"Takemitsu's genius for instrumentation (and genius it was, in my view) ...\", in the words of Oliver Knussen, \"... creates the illusion that the instrumental restrictions are self-imposed\".Knussen, Oliver, Liner notes to Takemitsu: Quotation of Dream, performed by Paul Crossley/Peter Serkin/London Sinfonietta/Oliver Knussen, Deutsche Grammophon: Echo 20/21 453 495\u20132.", "During the composition of Green (November Steps II, for orchestra, 1967: \"steeped in the sound-color world of the orchestral music of Claude Debussy\")Frank, Andrew, \"Review: Orchestral and Instrumental Music: T\u014dru Takemitsu: Green\", Notes, 2nd ser., vol. 33, no. 4 (June 1977), 934. Takemitsu said he had taken the scores of Debussy's Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune and Jeux to the mountain villa where both this work and November Steps I were composed. For Oliver Knussen, \"the final appearance of the main theme irresistibly prompts the thought that Takemitsu may, quite unconsciously, have been attempting a latter-day Japanese Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune\".Quoted in Anderson, i. Details of orchestration in Green, such as the prominent use of antique cymbals, and tremolandi harmonies in the strings, clearly point to the influence of Takemitsu's compositional mentor, and of these works in particular.Burt, 118.", "Composer Peter Lieberson shared the following in his program note to The Ocean that has no East and West, written in memory of Takemitsu: \"I spent the most time with Toru in Tokyo when I was invited to be a guest composer at his Music Today Festival in 1987.
