The first play (entitled simply Henry VI) featured a much shortened version of 1 Henry VI and half of 2 Henry VI (up to the death of Beaufort). The second play (entitled Edward IV) featured the second half of 2 Henry VI and a shortened version of 3 Henry VI, which was then followed by a shortened version of Richard III as the third play. In all, 1,450 lines written by Barton were added to 6,000 lines of original Shakespearean material, with a total of 12,350 lines removed.Taylor (2003: 33) The production starred David Warner as Henry, Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, Donald Sinden as York and Paul Hardwick as Gloucester. Barton and Hall were both especially concerned that the plays reflect the contemporary political environment, with the civil chaos and breakdown of society depicted in the plays mirrored in the contemporary milieu, by events such as the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. The directors allowed these events to reflect themselves in the production, arguing that \"we live among war, race riots, revolutions, assassinations, and the imminent threat of extinction. The theatre is, therefore, examining fundamentals in staging the Henry VI plays.\"Goodwin (1964: 47) They were also influenced by politically focused literary theory of the time; both had attended the 1956 London visit of Bertolt Brecht's Berliner Ensemble, both were subscribers to Antonin Artaud's theory of \"Theatre of Cruelty\", and Hall had read an English translation of Jan Kott's influential Shakespeare Our Contemporary in 1964 prior to its publication in Britain. Both Barton and Hall were also supporters of E.M.W. Tillyard's 1944 book Shakespeare's History Plays, which was still a hugely influential text in Shakespearian scholarship, especially in terms of its argument that Shakespeare in the tetraology was advancing the Tudor myth.Knowles (1999: 12\u201313)"]}, {"page": "Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay", "response": ["* In the television drama Churchill and the Generals by Paul Hardwick."]}, {"page": "Octopussy", "response": ["* Paul Hardwick as Soviet Chairman, presides over meeting between Orlov and Gogol."]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Edward Woodward,Ronald Fraser,Vivian Pickles,Paul Hardwick,James Villiers,Donald Layne-Smith,Trader Faulkner,Tim Preece,Nicholas Hawtrey,David Savile,Clifford Cox,Jimmy Gardner,Keith Pyott,Esmond Webb,Richard Hampton,Denis McCarthy", "|James Villiers,Charlotte Rampling,Anthony Bate,Paul Hardwick,Tim Preece,Gordon Waller,Jean Aubrey,Norman Shelley,Barbara Couper"]}, {"page": "The Prince and the Showgirl", "response": ["* Paul Hardwick as Major Domo"]}, {"page": "1990 (TV series)", "response": ["Jim Kyle (Edward Woodward) is a journalist on the last independent newspaper, called The Star, who turns renegade and fights the PCD covertly.
