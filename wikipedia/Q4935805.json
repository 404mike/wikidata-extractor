A versatile master of poetry, fictional prose and criticism, he was born in Cardiff in 1929, educated at the University of Wales, Cardiff (now Cardiff University) and University College Dublin. Jones held the chair in Welsh language at Aberystwyth from 1980 until his retirement.

He is considered the father of Dutch Neo-Calvinism and had considerable influence on the thought of philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd.

More recently he won first prize for Cornish poetry in the Cornish Gorsedd in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 1974 Berresford Ellis wrote, \"Probably the most able young writer in the language today is N.J.A. Williams (Golvan), a worthy successor to Edwin Chirgwin.\" Some of Williams's poetry in Cornish was published by Tim Saunders in The Wheel (1990) and Nothing Broken (2006). The Welsh critic Bobi Jones says in the introduction to this anthology, \"Nicholas Williams, the well-known scholar, is also the T. Gwynn Jones of Cornwall \u2013 polished, classical, rather conservative, soundly rooted in medieval romanticism.\" Williams's \"Ancow Arthur\", a translation of Tennyson\u2019s \"Morte D'Arthur\", published in Delyow Derow 15 (1996) is an example of his verse."]}, {"page": "R. Tudur Jones", "response": ["Most of Jones' publications were of an historical nature. Nevertheless, his theology and his opinions on doctrine would surface regularly in his work. He was a firm Calvinist, and although it is tempting to classify him as evangelical (see also his fellow Welsh Christian scholars Bobi Jones and R. Geraint Gruffydd), he distanced himself from the pietistic evangelicalism that rose from the ashes of the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival. He opposed liberal theology and feared humanism's effect on the people of Wales."]}, {"page": "Robert Maynard Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bobi Jones"]}, {"page": "Cymdeithas y Dysgwyr", "response": ["One of its founders and current honorary president is Professor Bobi Jones, a renowned Welsh scholar."]}, {"page": "2003 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones \u2013 Beirniadaeth Gyfansawdd \u2013 Fframwaith Cyflawn Beirniadaeth Lenyddol"]}, {"page": "1994 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones \u2013 Crist a Chenedlaetholdeb (Christ and Nationalism)"]}, {"page": "1988 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones - Llenyddiaeth Gymraeg 1902-36"]}, {"page": "1986 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones \u2013 Hunllef Arthur"]}, {"page": "1980 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones is appointed to the professorial Chair in Welsh at University of Wales, Aberystwyth."]}, {"page": "1974 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones - Tafod y Llenor"]}, {"page": "1972 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones \u2013 Allor Wydn"]}, {"page": "Robert Jones", "response": ["* Bobi Jones (Robert Maynard Jones, 1929\u20132017), Welsh Christian academic"]}, {"page": "1958 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones \u2013 Nid yw Dwr yn Plygu"]}, {"page": "1957 in Wales", "response": ["*Bobi Jones \u2013 Y G\u00e2n Gyntaf"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh writers", "response": ["*Bobi Jones (Robert Maynard Jones, born 1929, W), writer and academic"]}, {"page": "Robert Maynard Jones (Bobi Jones)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bobi Jones"]}, {"page": "1929 in Wales", "response": ["*20 May - Bobi Jones, author (died 2017)"]}, {"page": "Gustave Guillaume", "response": ["* He heavily influenced the Welsh academic, Bobi Jones."]}, {"page": "Y Fflam", "response": ["It was edited by Euros Bowen, Pennar Davies and J.
