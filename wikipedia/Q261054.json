He has written 11 novels, five collections of shorter fiction, three novellas and five collections of non-fiction writing.\nHis 2002 novel Dorian, an Imitation was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and his 2012 novel Umbrella was shortlisted. His fiction is known for being satirical, grotesque and fantastical, and is predominantly set within his home city of London. His writing often explores mental illness, drug abuse and psychiatry.\nSelf is a regular contributor to publications including The Guardian, Harper's Magazine, The New York Times and the London Review of Books. He currently writes a column for the New Statesman, and he has been a columnist for the Observer, The Times, and the Evening Standard. His columns for Building Design on the built environment, and for the Independent Magazine on the psychology of place brought him to prominence as a thinker concerned with the politics of urbanism.\nSelf is a regular contributor to British television, initially as a guest on comic panel shows such as Have I Got News for You. In 2002, Self replaced Mark Lamarr on the anarchic BBC comedy panel show Shooting Stars  for two series, but was himself replaced by comedian Jack Dee when the programme returned in 2008.  He has since appeared on current affairs programmes such as Newsnight and Question Time. Self is contributor to the BBC Radio 4 programme A Point of View, to which he contributes radio essays delivered in his familiar \"lugubrious tones\". In 2013, Self took part in discussions about becoming the inaugural BBC Radio 4 Writer-in-Residence, but later withdrew.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Clockwork Orange (novel)", "response": ["A Clockwork Orange was written in Hove, then a senescent seaside town.
