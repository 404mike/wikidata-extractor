His fiction has appeared in anthologies, magazines, and the collections The Silver Voices, Written by Daylight, Cities and Thrones and Powers, and Buried Shadows. The majority of Howard's stories have central and eastern European settings; many are set in the fictional Romanian town of Steaua de Munte. The Defeat of Grief is a novella set in Steaua de Munte and the real Black Sea resort of Balcic; the novellas \"The Fatal Vision\" (in Cities and Thrones and Powers) and The Lustre of Time form part of an ongoing series with Steaua de Munte architect and academic Cristian Luca as protagonist. Numbered as Sand or the Stars attempts a 'secret history' of Hungary between the World Wars.\nJohn Howard has published three collections jointly written with Mark Valentine. Secret Europe comprises 25 short stories set in a variety of real and fictional European locations. Ten of the stories are by Howard and fifteen by Valentine. The expanded edition published in 2014 added an introduction and an extra story by Mark Valentine. Inner Europe (2018) is in the same vein, and comprises six stories by Howard and seven by Valentine. Powers and Presences (2020), a tribute to the 'theological thrillers' of Charles Williams, comprises the novella \"The Dance of Gold\" by Howard and two novelettes by Valentine. \nHoward contributed a story to Dreams of Ourselves, an anthology published in tribute to the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa. Contributors and editor used Pessoa heteronyms, with the authors' names only revealed in the sealed envelope supplied with each copy of the book.\nSince 2003 John Howard has occasionally collaborated on short stories with Mark Valentine. Seven have featured Valentine's long-running series character The Connoisseur, an occult detective whose real name is never revealed. All tales of The Connoisseur then extant, including the collaborations, were reprinted in The Collected Connoisseur (Tartarus Press, 2010).John Howard has written essays for numerous magazines including Book and Magazine Collector, Supernatural Tales, Wormwood, Studies in Australian Weird Fiction, and All Hallows for the Ghost Story Society. He contributed essays to the Fritz Leiber special issue of Fantasy Commentator (No. 57/58, 2004) and to the books Black Prometheus: A Critical Study of Karl Edward Wagner (Gothic Press, 2007), Fritz Leiber: Critical Essays (McFarlane, 2008), and The Man Who Collected Psychos: Critical Essays on Robert Bloch (McFarlane, 2009), all edited by Benjamin Szumskyj. Most of these essays were included in Touchstones: Essays on the Fantastic (2014), which was a British Fantasy Award nominee the following year. In 2013 Howard took over the review column Camera Obscura in Tartarus Press' journal Wormwood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Howard (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Howard (born 1939) was Prime Minister of Australia from 1996 to 2007.", "John Howard may also refer to:", "*John Howard (died 1437) (1366\u20131437), MP for Essex, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk", "*John Howard (MP for Faversham) (1863\u20131911), British Member of Parliament for Faversham 1900\u20131906", "*John Howard (Southampton Test MP) (1913\u20131982), British Member of Parliament, 1955\u20131964", "*John Howard (Australian actor) (born 1952), Australian actor", "*John Howard (American actor) (1913\u20131995), American actor", "*John Howard (cyclist) (born 1947), Olympic cyclist who set a land speed record on a pedal bicycle", "*John Howard (athlete) (1888\u20131937), Canadian athlete who ran in the 1912 Summer Olympics", "*John Howard (fighter) (born 1983), mixed martial arts fighter", "*John Howard (lacrosse) (1934\u20132007), American educator and lacrosse player and coach", "*John Howard (sprinter) (born 1981), Micronesian sprinter", "*John Howard (adventure racer), New Zealander considered the pioneer of adventure racing", "*John Howard (singer-songwriter) (born 1953), English singer-songwriter and pianist", "*John Howard (civil engineer) (1901\u20131986), British civil engineer", "*John Howard (industrialist) (1791\u20131878), British industrialist", "*John Howard (mathematician) (1753\u20131799), Scottish mathematician", "*John Howard (NIOSH director), American public health administrator", "*John Howard (optical physicist) (1921\u20132015), president of the Optical Society of America in 1991", "*John Howard (British Army officer) (1912\u20131999), best known for leading a vital assault during D-Day in the Second World War", "*John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (c. 1425\u20131485), Duke of Norfolk and Lord High Admiral", "*John Howard, 15th Earl of Suffolk (1739\u20131820), British soldier and nobleman", "*John Howard (author) (born 1961), English author", "*John Howard (prison reformer) (1726\u20131790), English prison reformer of the 18th century, also refer to the John Howard Society of Canada", "*John Howard, American professor of English and humanities", "*John Howard (UK businessman), British businessman", "*John Howard, a minor character in Marvel Comics.", "*John Wagner (born 1949), comics writer who used the nom de plume John Howard"]}, {"page": "Mark Valentine", "response": ["Valentine's short stories have been published in a number of collections and in anthologies.
