It is about the life of the 16th-century French nobleman, wine grower, philosopher, and essayist Michel Eyquem de Montaigne. In it, Bakewell \"roughly maps out Montaigne's life against the questions he raises along the way,\" drawing the answers to these questions from his Essays.", "Bakewell's writing voice and enthusiasm about Montaigne have also been praised. In his review of the book in The Independent, Michael Bywater writes that \"Sarah Bakewell embraces [Montaigne's] exuberant digressiveness with delight and obvious profound affection. It's rare to come across a biographer who remains so deliciously fond of her subject. She turns her extensive research towards making the reader not just know Montaigne but love him.... Bakewell pulls off the great trick of writing Montaigne in both the context of his own time and of subsequent ages. If you know his work, How to Live will delight and illuminate. If you don't, the book stands splendidly alone, as a picture of a man worth knowing, and will certainly turn you to the Essays. In short, Montaigne has here the biography he deserves, and would have enjoyed its unconventional structure.... Bakewell makes no attempt to efface herself, yet her vivid presence never obscures his. It's rather like having a conversation about a mutual friend, with one who knows him much better.\" Meanwhile, in his introduction to Bakewell's article on Three Guys One Book, Denis Haritou writes that \"Reading How to Live is like wandering in a sun-dappled forest of literature. There are so many paths to take, so many hints of other great writers to explore, that you could never track them all down from one reading.

The book discusses the ideas of the phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, and how his teaching influenced the rise of existentialism through the likes of Martin Heidegger, Jean Paul Sartre, Simone De Beauvoir, who are the main protagonists of the book.
