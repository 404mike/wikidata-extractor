When the chief executive of that body made contact with the diocese on the matter, he was met with lack of co-operation.  Meetings held with Bishop John Magee and representatives of the diocese in March failed to elicit his full co-operation with the National Board for Child Protection's investigation. As per BBC News, \"The report found that Bishop John Magee falsely told the government and the health service that his diocese was reporting all abuse allegations to authorities. It also found that the bishop deliberately misled another inquiry and his own advisors by creating two different accounts of a meeting with a priest suspecting of abusing a child, one for the Vatican and the other for diocesan files\".", "On 28 June 2008, Ian Elliott, the chief executive officer of Safeguarding, completed a damning report on the handling of both cases by Magee, by his delegate for Child Protection, O'Callaghan, and by his inter-diocesan case management committee.  The Elliot Report was examined by that case management committee on 9 July 2008, and it adopted a position threatening Elliot and Safeguarding with legal action were they to publish the Report.  In the meantime, Elliott passed the report to the Irish Government and to the minister for Children, Barry Andrews who did not read the report but passed it to the Health Service Executive to compile another report on it."]}, {"page": "2005 NCAA Men's Water Polo Championship", "response": ["*Ian Elliott, Loyola Marymount"]}, {"page": "2013 Rugby League World Cup qualification \u2013 Atlantic", "response": ["|  New York Knights || Fitz James Adams, Charles Cortalano, Ian Elliott, Justin Ripley, Sean Taylor"]}]}}
