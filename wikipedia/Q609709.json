Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, Teller was invited to the United States to become a professor of physics at George Washington University, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. At George Washington University in 1937, Teller predicted the Jahn\u2013Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, Teller also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) isotherm.Journal of the American Chemical Society, 60 (2) , pp. 309\u2013319 (1938).

The latter process is called the Jahn-Teller effect; this effect was recently considered also in relation to the superconductivity mechanism in YBCO and other high temperature superconductors.

In cooperation with the head of the theory department Brian Flowers, fundamental work was carried out in the 1950s that helped to unite the shell model with collective models of the core structure. In particular, they investigated the structure of light nuclei (oxygen, fluorine). He was at the University of Rochester for a year and was from 1962 professor at the University of Sussex, where he retired in 1994, but remained scientifically active until his death.
