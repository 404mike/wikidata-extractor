Local residents were pleased with the news, but a survey suggested 90% still preferred a diversion away from the stones instead. The plan was finalised the following year as part of a \u00a32 billion programme. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the improvements would \"transform\" the A303 and would be important for removing congestion. In November 2020, the plans were confirmed again in a report by Transport Secretary Andrew Stephenson, and endorsed by Highways England. Though the Government said it had carefully listened to all opinions on the tunnel, the decision to proceed was condemned by environmental campaigners."]}, {"page": "Gordon Prentice", "response": ["He had lived in Newmarket, Ontario for almost three years by January 2014, therefore permanently leaving the United Kingdom; he continues to reside there to this day.
