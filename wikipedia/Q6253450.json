In 1802 he won a scholarship to the Bristol Baptist College to train as a minister, but in 1807 funds were abruptly withdrawn, on the grounds that he was 'entertaining opinions widely different from us on most of the doctrines we consider to be essential to Evangelical Religion'. At 19 years old he was already showing the courage and independence of mind that were to characterise his life, however it led to a break with his parents who never spoke to him again. Over the following four years Smith turned to Unitarianism, influenced by William Blake, a minister at Crewkerne, Somerset: Blake put him in touch with John Prior Estlin at Lewin's Mead, Bristol. Another friend, and Unitarian convert from Baptism who became a physician, was Benjamin Spencer.

He was educated in Bristol in John Prior Estlin's school, before spending two years at Daventry Academy, his father's alma mater, 1787-89. William Priestley was a mild-tempered and softly-spoken bohemian with long brown hair thrown back over his shoulders, and a passion for nature and music. He was a proficient flautist, who spoke French and German, studied Anglo-Saxon texts, and read Norse mythology. He carved wooden chess-pieces, and sculpted clay models of ancient temples.Life of Mary Anne Schimmelpenninck (2 vols, London, 1858), I, 132-5, 156-8.

His father, writing to a friend, regretted that William's \"temper [frame of mind] and high spirit [zest for life], will hardly suit trade.\"In the eighteenth-century, temper indicated either a calmness of mind, or simply frame of mind; high spirit meant ebullience or zest for life. In this, William and his father were very much alike, for, when he was nineteen, Joseph Priestley himself, had rejected a firm offer of a career in commerce; as a minister at Needham Market, his congregation had objected to Priestley's \"gay and airy disposition;\" and at Nantwich he had a habit of vaulting over the counter of the grocer's shop at which he lodged.Anne Holt, A life of Joseph Priestley (Oxford, 1931), 7, 19. Regrettably some modern historians have misunderstood contemporary word-usage, and have read the clause: \"William's temper and high spirit, will hardly suit trade,\" in a twenty-first-century idiom, mistakenly accusing William of being \"too high-spirited and hot-tempered;\"Robert E Schofield, The enlightened Joseph Priestley (Pennsylvania, 2004), 317. and erroneously denouncing him as the \"black sheep\" of the family.James J Hoecker, Priestley pedigree, Price-Priestley Newsletter, no.4 (1980), 75-8."]}]}}
