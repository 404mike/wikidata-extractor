He was notable for his contributions of ethnographic and typological studies of the indigenous peoples of Botswana and South Africa. Additionally, he was one of the founders of the group that would develop British social anthropology.\nNot only did Schapera write numerous publications of his extensive research done in South Africa and Botswana, he published his work throughout his career (1923\u20131969), and even after he retired. As an anthropologist he focused on the lives and customs of the indigenous peoples of South Africa and was considered to be a specialist in the topic. Early in his career he would focus on studies of the Khoisan of South Africa until the 1930s, when he would begin to focus on Tswana of Botswana.\nSchapera also received many honours and titles, such as being the president of the Royal Anthropology Institute. Additionally, he was awarded an honorary doctorate when the University of Botswana was founded in 1985, was elected as Chair of the Association of Social Anthropology, and the Journal of African Law was founded in his honour.\n\nTo compile his work for future generations and note his anthropological contributions a bibliography was published in the Botswana Journal of African African Studies. This academic journal has also dedicated an entire issue to the work he had done throughout his career. In 2003 his obituary was published in the academic journal Anthropology Today, titled \"The Legacy of Isaac Schapera\". In the wake of his death, photographs he had taken of South Africa were published in a book Picturing a Colonial Past; The African Photographs by Isaac Schapera and the Recovering the Botswana project would be dedicated to him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Afroasiatic languages", "response": ["Greenberg developed his model fully in his book The Languages of Africa (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably Nilo-Saharan. Following Isaac Schapera and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the  Khoekhoe language as a member of the Khoisan languages, a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian Hadza and Sandawe, though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages regard them as linguistic isolates. Despite this, Greenberg's classification remains a starting point for modern work on many languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this."]}, {"page": "International African Institute", "response": ["The IAI has been involved in scholarly publishing since 1927.

South African anthropologist Meyer Fortes noted how the term was commonly used in the European sociological context as a \"synonym for such words as 'pathological', 'disintegrated', 'demoralized', in a pejorative or deprecatory sense.\" Isaac Schapera recognized that the term was being misapplied by Europeans who assumed that urbanization in colonial society implied detribalization: \"it is not correct to assume that all people who go to the Union [of South Africa] from Bechuanaland tend to become 'detribalized'.\"Bovenkerk 1975, p. 27. H. M. Robertson states that \"the urban native is classed as 'detribalized,' but this is not necessarily the case.\"Robertson 2015, p. 143. Ellen Hellmann similarly described in her sociological work \"that 'the process of detribalization has been exaggerated' among the urban African population, although 'the average European would unhesitatingly classify these Natives as detribalized'.\" In his sociological study, William Watson concludes that while \"under urban conditions, Africans rapidly assimilate European dress, material culture, and outward forms of behaviour, this assimilation does not necessarily imply detribalization. On the contrary, many attempts to organize African industrial workers on a common basis of economic interest have encountered great difficulties because of African tribal solidarities and inter-tribal hostilities.\"Watson 1958, p. 4-6.", "While Europeans and white South Africans during this period classed all urban Africans as \"detribalized,\" this was largely an extension of existing racism which had flattened all Africans into indistinguishable masses of \"disorderly\" racialized subjects and was not necessarily reflective of reality. In fact, many Indigenous people working on European-owned farms and in urban districts were not formally \"detribalized,\" or detached from their \"tribal\" identities or communities. Professor at Stellenbosch University J. F. W. Grosskopf recorded that \"many Europeans coming into touch with the native only in the bigger centres seem inclined to over-estimate the number of 'detribalized' natives... Such natives may have adopted a semi-European urban mode of life for several years, while it still remains a difficult matter for the white man to say how far tribal influence and connection has actually ceased.\" In 1914, Grosskopf documented an instance in which several urbanized Black South Africans who had \"never visited their tribe in Thaba Nehu\" left their \"permanent and well-paid jobs in Bloomfontein\" after a Baralong chief \"bought land for his followers in the southern part of Rhodesia.\" They recorded in a notice to their employers that they were leaving \"'for our chief is calling us'.\" Anthropologist Isaac Schapera similarly noted that urbanization did not necessarily imply detribalization, essentially recognizing the differences between assimilation in Western society and detribalization."]}]}}
