He was born as Eli Parish in Teignmouth, Devon; his father was a local organist. His baptismal record at St James\u2019s Church, West Teignmouth, reads: \"Eli, son of Joseph and Mary Ann Parish\".Parish gave his first concert in Totnes in 1818 and in 1820 was sent to London to study with Nicolas-Charles Bochsa. In 1822 he applied to the Royal Academy of Music, where Bochsa had been appointed harp professor, but was not accepted, because he could not afford the tuition fees without a scholarship. He was able to continue his lessons with Bochsa by undertaking teaching and playing at dances. He was also later able to study in Paris, and in 1828 studied music in Florence. At around this time he changed his first name to \"Elias\"; Parish appears to have used the name \"Parish Alvars\" from the early 1830s; the origins of the name are not known. In 1836, the first publication of his music by Artaria in Vienna used the name \"Elias Parish Alvars\", which was subsequently used in all his publications.In 1836 Alvars became first harp at the Vienna Opera. His 1838 Fantasia, op. 35, is dedicated to Sigismond Thalberg, who is said to have been inspired by Alvars's playing to develop his own three-hand effect piano technique. Alvars's tour of the Near East in the period 1838-1842 resulted in his suite Voyage d'un harpiste en l' Orient, op. 79.In 1842 Alvars married the harpist Melanie Lewy, a member of a Vienna-based family of musicians with whom Alvars frequently performed. His pupils included Charlotte Rothschild of the Rothschild family, to whom he dedicated his Serenade, Op. 83.<ref> In the same year he acquired a double-action pedal harp designed by Pierre \u00c9rard; the innovations he was able to bring to harp technique using this new instrument impressed many of his fellow musicians including Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn and Franz Liszt. Liszt wrote of Alvars \"From beneath his forehead speak his dreamy eyes, expressive of the glowing imagination which lives in his compositions\"; Berlioz called him \"the Liszt of the harp\".In 1847 Alvars was appointed chamber musician to Ferdinand I of Austria. His last performance was in Vienna, at a concert of his own compositions, in January 1848.On 13 March 1848 riots erupted in Vienna and in April amid the general confusion Alvars found himself in serious financial straits. His health worsened suddenly and he died, probably of pneumonia, on 25 January 1849. He was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Concerto", "response": ["* Elias Parish Alvars: Harp Concertos  and "]}, {"page": "1808 in music", "response": ["*February 28 \u2013 Elias Parish Alvars, English-born arranger and harpist (died 1849)"]}, {"page": "1832 in music", "response": ["*Spring \u2013 Elias Parish Alvars gives concerts in Constantinople before Sultan Mahmud II."]}, {"page": "Teignmouth", "response": ["Fanny Burney, the diarist and novelist, visited Teignmouth several times in the late 18th century.

Various intricate problems in piano playing were solved during this period, and unusual techniques invented. Advances in piano technology also enabled innovative techniques.See Loesser (1990), pp. 358\u2013359, and Harding (1978), p. 153. Sigismond Thalberg employed a three-hand effect in his Fantasy on Don Juan (1833\u201334) and subsequently gained great success using it in his Fantasy on Rossini's Mo\u00efse (1835). Thalberg primarily used the technique in settings of other composers' works. Arthur Loesser describes his style as \"drawing scarves of quick arpeggios\" above and below a melody. He adds \"[Thalberg's] clever shading that helped make this device convincing: since the accompanying arpeggios were very soft, the resonance of the well brought out melody tones...could seem to 'sing'.\"Loesser (1990), p. 372. Moriz Rosenthal alleged that Thalberg had adapted this effect from the harp technique of Elias Parish Alvars (1808\u20131849).Rosenthal (2005), p. 75. A contemporary review of Thalberg playing in London mentioned \"myriads of notes sounding from one extremity of the instrument to the other without disturbing the subject, in which the three distinct features of this combination are clearly brought out by his exquisite touch.\"Cited in Harding (1978), p. 155. Carl Czerny noted that the technique also required careful novel use of the piano pedals, especially the sustaining pedal; normally having been used to sustain notes in the bass register, Thalberg applied it \"to the notes of the middle and higher octaves, and thereby [produced] entirely new effects, which had hitherto never been imagined.\"Cited in . Thalberg's entry in Grove Music Online is more circumspect, explaining that \"Thalberg's basic compositional method was relatively simple, consisting of placing the melody in the centre of the keyboard first in one hand, then in the other (the thumbs and the sustaining pedal used in particular to prolong the sound), and ornamenting it with florid counterpoint and chords above and below\", and concluding that \"Thalberg's compositions are of questionable value\". Douglas Bomberger has commented \"Thalberg has come to represent the excesses of the romantic period, when bigger was better and two hands could sound like three.\""]}, {"page": "Florence Sitruk", "response": ["In 2008 she was  of the Elias Parish Alvars Harp Festival in Teignmouth.
