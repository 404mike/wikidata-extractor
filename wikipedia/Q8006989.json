He is best known for writing Watermills and Windmills, published in 1933 and reprinted in 1976, which is considered a standard work on the topic of Kent windmills.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chatham, Kent", "response": ["*William Coles Finch, author and historian, lived at Luton, Chatham."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed", "response": ["Over the years she took thousands of photographs, about four hundred of which were included in various publications, Including Water, its Origin and Use by William Coles Finch. Elizabeth developed and printed her own work often in terrible conditions and would sell them in aid of charity, give them as gifts, or give them as a prize at mountaineering events. Sadly very little of Elizabeth's  photography work is left from her days mountaineering and traveling."]}, {"page": "Biddenden Maids", "response": ["In 1900, antiquarian George Clinch investigated the Biddenden Maids in detail. Examining the costumes of the figures on the Biddenden cake moulds, he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of Mary I (1553\u20131558), a date roughly consistent with the \"two hundred and fifty years ago\" reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century. He suggested that the \"1100\" date on Biddenden cakes had originally read \"1500\", and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error. It is likely that the cake moulds examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775. Writing in the early 1930s, William Coles Finch explains the confusion over the dates, saying \"the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one\". He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be unleavened bread."]}, {"page": "Coffin Stone", "response": ["In 1893, the antiquarian George Payne described the monument in his Collectanea Cantiana, noting that locally it was known as both the Coffin Stone and the General's Stone. Ashbee later suggested that Payne was actually confusing the Coffin Stone with the General's Stone, which was a separate megalith found several hundred metres away, in the same field as Kit's Coty House. In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coffin Stone alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In his 1927 book In Kentish Pilgrimland, William Coles Finch included a plate of the Coffin Stone; the photograph featured his son standing on it and shows various broken sarsens piled up at the monument's eastern end. Finch's plate was the first published photograph of the megalith, and was likely also the last published depiction of it before another large sarsen was placed over it. Finch measured the sarsen and found it to be wider than Thorpe had reported, also making note of plough damage and breakages. In a 1946 article on the folklore involving the Medway Megaliths, Evans noted that the Coffin Stone, like several other megalithic features in the area, was associated with a burial following the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford. The idea that one or more of these monuments had been linked to the battle was first mooted by early modern antiquarians, before entering local folklore."]}, {"page": "White Horse Stone", "response": ["In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Upper White Horse Stone alongside the other Medway Megaliths. William Coles Finch then discussed the site in his 1927 work, In Kentish Pilgrimland, its Ancient Roads and Shrines, including a photograph of it; at this point it was in the open air rather than being found in a patch of woodland. In 1970, the archaeologist R. F. Jessup published an account of the stone alongside another photo, indicating that by this time trees had grown up around it."]}, {"page": "Pilgrims' Way", "response": ["From Thomas Becket's  canonization in 1173, until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538, his shrine at Canterbury became the most important in the country, indeed \"after Rome...the chief shrine in Christendom\",Wright (1971: 16) and it drew pilgrims from far and wide. Winchester, apart from being an ecclesiastical centre in its own right (the shrine of St Swithin), was an important regional focus and an aggregation point for travellers arriving through the seaports on the south coast.  It is \"widely accepted\" that this was the route taken by Henry II on his pilgrimage of atonement for the death of Bishop Thomas, from France to Canterbury in July 1174, although this has been disputed and some evidence points to his having taken a route via London. A Pipe Roll record for the hire of horses for the King's escort to London is extant. Travellers from Winchester to Canterbury  naturally used the ancient way, as it was the direct route, and research by local historians has provided much by way of detail\u2014sometimes embellished\u2014of the pilgrims' journeys. The numbers making their way to Canterbury by this route were not recorded, but the estimate by the Kentish historian William Coles Finch that it carried more than 100,000 pilgrims a year is surely an exaggeration; a more prosaic estimate\u2014extrapolated from the records of pilgrims' offerings at the shrine\u2014contends an annual figure closer to 1,000. Hooper (1936) 44 \"In their train have followed the host of guide-books and popular writers who have expanded and embellished ad libitum as fancy prompted\".  A separate (and more reliably attested) route  to Canterbury from London was by way of Watling Street, as followed by the storytellers in The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer."]}, {"page": "WCF", "response": ["* William Coles Finch, English author who signed his sketches \"W.C.F.\""]}, {"page": "Coles (surname)", "response": ["* William Coles Finch (1864\u20131944),English author and historian"]}]}}
