He is one of the few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is because he has the establishment status that Basil craves. He usually wears the Royal Artillery jagged-striped tie, and once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir being in France in 1918. He often is introduced as their \"oldest resident\" and in the episode \"Waldorf Salad\" Basil reveals that the Major has lived there for seven years. He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers' strikes (the frequent strikes at British Leyland during the time of the series' original transmission were often mentioned), and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode \"The Germans\" he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. The best he can say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between \"wogs\" and \"niggers\". Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode \"Communication Problems\" in which Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil."]}, {"page": "1904", "response": ["* August 6 \u2013 Ballard Berkeley, British actor (died 1988)"]}, {"page": "1988 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 16 || Ballard Berkeley || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 83 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| National Lampoon's European Vacation || Warner Bros. || Amy Heckerling (director); John Hughes, Robert Klane (screenplay); Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Dana Hill, Jason Lively, John Astin, Malcolm Danare, William Zabka, Gary Owens, Jeannette Charles, Mel Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Maureen Lipman, Paul McDowell, Ballard Berkeley, Eric Idle, Jacques Herlin, Willy Millowitsch, Claudia Neidig, Victor Lanoux, Moon Unit Zappa || Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "The BFG", "response": ["* The Heads of the Army and the Air Force: Two bombastic officers answering to the Queen.
