Set in London in 1985 and the planet Telos in the future, in the serial the Cybermen intend to change the course of history by destroying Earth with Halley's Comet in 1985, which would prevent the destruction of the Cybermen's original home planet Mondas. In addition to its contemporary London setting, it also features several other references to the previous season's Resurrection of the Daleks, notably the return of Lytton (played by Maurice Colbourne) and his henchmen (who again masquerade as policemen), and is directed by Matthew Robinson in his second and final contribution to the series.", "Attack of the Cybermen was the first of several stories from this season to provoke controversy over its depiction of violence. In 1985, Australasian Doctor Who Fan Club president Tony Howe singled out the crushing of Lytton's hands until they oozed blood as being an instance of \"sick, shock violence like Andy Warhol's\" that was present for \"cheap shock value only\". Doctor Who: The Television Companion's own review of the story is similarly critical of the scene, describing it as a \"gratuitous incident\" which is \"unnecessarily nasty and gory\". It acknowledges some \"saving graces\", including Matthew Robinson's \"polished direction\" and Maurice Colbourne's return, who \"manages to give a boost to every scene in which he appears\", but states the story is \"superficially exciting but it does not stand up to considered scrutiny or repeated viewing\", describing it as \"one of the most derivative stories that Doctor Who ever turned out\"."]}, {"page": "Resurrection of the Daleks", "response": ["For Radio Times, Mark Braxton awarded the serial three stars out of five.

And there is so much in the way of homage that Resurrection of the Daleks is less than the sum of its parts. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Does it feel like a proper story? Sadly not.\" The serial was awarded four stars out of five by Andrew Allen in a review for Cultbox. Allen thought the story bore a closer resemblance to a Blake's 7 episode than a standard Doctor Who story with its \"grim-faced mercenaries, disaffected crew members\" and \"unrelenting body count\". Although he thought the \"location filming in Wapping looks wonderful\", he was critical of \"perfunctory\" production aspects including the presentation of the Daleks \"without fanfare, majesty or indeed a fresh lick of paint\", and Davros' introduction \"glowering behind a sheet of frosted plastic, unremarked upon for a healthy chunk of screentime\". He also thought it was \"not a great story to serve as Janet Fielding\u2019s swansong\". Overall, he concluded that it was \"not the best Dalek story\" but \"quite far from the worst: full of drive, energy, and quite genuinely never a dull moment.\""]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Maurice Colbourne, actor"]}, {"page": "Gangsters (TV series)", "response": ["Gangsters is a British television programme made by BBC television drama and shown in two series from 1976 to 1978.
