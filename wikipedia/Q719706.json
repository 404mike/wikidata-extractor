He was a glover and whittawer (leather worker) by trade. Shakespeare  was elected to several municipal offices, serving as an alderman and culminating in a term as bailiff, the chief magistrate of the town council, and mayor of Stratford in 1568, before he fell on hard times for reasons unknown. His fortunes later revived and he was granted a coat of arms five years before his death, probably at the instigation and expense of his son, the actor and playwright.He married Mary Arden, with whom he had eight children, five of whom survived into adulthood.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
