He was a glover and whittawer (leather worker) by trade. Shakespeare  was elected to several municipal offices, serving as an alderman and culminating in a term as bailiff, the chief magistrate of the town council, and mayor of Stratford in 1568, before he fell on hard times for reasons unknown. His fortunes later revived and he was granted a coat of arms five years before his death, probably at the instigation and expense of his son, the actor and playwright.He married Mary Arden, with whom he had eight children, five of whom survived into adulthood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pub", "response": ["In 1393, King Richard II of England compelled landlords to erect signs outside their premises. The legislation stated \"Whosoever shall brew ale in the town with intention of selling it must hang out a sign, otherwise he shall forfeit his ale.\" This law was to make alehouses easily visible to passing inspectors, borough ale tasters, who would decide the quality of the ale they provided. William Shakespeare's father, John Shakespeare, was one such inspector."]}, {"page": "Recusancy", "response": ["Some scholars also believe there is evidence that several members of Shakespeare's family were secretly recusant Catholics. The strongest evidence is a tract professing secret Catholicism signed by John Shakespeare, father of the poet. The tract was found in the 18th century in the rafters of a house which had once been John Shakespeare's, and was seen and described by the reputable scholar Edmond Malone. Malone later changed his mind and declared that he thought the tract was a forgery.Quoted in Schoenbaum (1977: 49) \"In my conjecture concerning the writer of that paper I certainly was mistaken\". Although the document has since been lost, Anthony Holden writes that Malone's reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by Charles Borromeo and circulated in England by Edmund Campion, copies of which still exist in Italian and English.Holden, Anthony. William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius  Little, Brown (2000). Other research, however, suggests that the Borromeo testament is a 17th-century artefact (at the earliest dated from 1638), was not printed for missionary work, and could never have been in the possession of John Shakespeare.Bearman, R., \"John Shakespeare's Spiritual Testament, a reappraisal\", Shakespeare Survey 56 [2003] pp. 184\u2013204. John Shakespeare was listed as one who did not attend church services, but this was \"for feare of processe for Debtte\", according to the commissioners, not because he was a recusant.Mutschmann, H. and Wentersdorf, K.,  Shakespeare and Catholicism, Sheed and Ward: New York, 1952, p.\u00a0401."]}, {"page": "September 7", "response": ["*1601 \u2013 John Shakespeare, father of William Shakespeare (b. 1529)"]}, {"page": "William Shakespeare", "response": ["Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.", "Shakespeare conformed to the official state religion, but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law. Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \"for fear of process for debt\", a common Catholic excuse. In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove."]}, {"page": "1757", "response": ["* April 29 \u2013 Inside a house at Stratford-upon-Avon in England, a bricklayer, identified only as \"Mosely\", discovers the testament of John Shakespeare, father of William Shakespeare, more than 150 years after the elder's death.
