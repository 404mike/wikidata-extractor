In the 1930s he was editor of the influential magazine New Verse, and went on to produce 13 collections of his own poetry, as well as compiling numerous anthologies, among many published works on subjects including art, travel and the countryside. Grigson exhibited in the London International Surrealist Exhibition at New Burlington Galleries in 1936, and in 1946 co-founded the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Grigson's autobiography The Crest on the Silver was published in 1950. At various times he was involved in teaching, journalism and broadcasting. Fiercely combative, he made many literary enemies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dylan Thomas", "response": ["Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: \"And death shall have no dominion\", \"Before I Knocked\" and \"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower\". \"And death shall have no dominion\" appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933. When \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" appeared in The Listener in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S.

The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves.  A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him."]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Geoffrey Grigson (1905\u20131985, E)"]}, {"page": "March 2", "response": ["*  1905   \u2013 Geoffrey Grigson, English poet and critic (d. 1985)"]}, {"page": "November 25", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 Geoffrey Grigson, English poet and critic (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "W.

Keating welcomed her inside and told her all about his life as a restorer and artist, not discussing his life as a forger.
