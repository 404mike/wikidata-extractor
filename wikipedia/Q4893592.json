He was a half-back, usually on the right side, and is regarded as one of the club's greatest ever players.\nRobinson played 380 League and Cup games for Norwich after joining from King's Lynn, from his debut on 2 April 1932 at Exeter City to his final appearance on 12 March 1949 against Ipswich Town at Carrow Road, scoring 14 goals. The Second World War took six years out of his career, but for which he may well have become the club's appearance record holder - he also played in 160 wartime matches for the Canaries. He was a member of the Norwich team that won the Division Three (South) Championship in 1934 and was considered an expert penalty taker, as well as a long throw specialist.\nAfter retiring from football, Robinson briefly ran a public house. By the time of the club's centenary celebrations in 2002, Robinson was the club's oldest surviving player, living in retirement in Sprowston, near Norwich.\nFive days after Robinson's death, a minute's silence was held before Norwich's home match against Fulham, and the squad wore black armbands in further tribute.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bernard Robinson", "response": ["Bernard Robinson may refer to:", "*Bernard Robinson (production designer) (1912\u20131970), English set designer", "*Bernard Robinson (basketball) (born 1980), American National Basketball Association player", "*Bernard Robinson (footballer) (1911\u20132004), English professional football player", "*Bernard Robinson (kickboxer) (born 1966), American kickboxer and Guinness World Record holder"]}]}}
