Often called the doyenne of Scottish literature, she wrote over 90 books of historical fiction, science fiction, travel writing and autobiography. Her husband Dick Mitchison's life peerage in 1964 entitled her to call herself Lady Mitchison, but she never did. She was appointed CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1981. The Corn King and the Spring Queen (1931) is seen by some as the prime 20th-century historical novel.", "link_mentions": {}}}
