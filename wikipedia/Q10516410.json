He left after a year, and then spent a short time as joint-manager of Arbroath with George Mackie in 1994, before joining Hibs as a coach in July of that year. He served as a youth coach under managers Alex Miller and Alex McLeish, and became the interim manager when McLeish left for Rangers in 2001. When Franck Sauz\u00e9e was appointed as McLeish's successor, Park was promoted to the position of the assistant manager. Sauzee was sacked by Hibs after only 69 days as manager, and Park left the club at the end of the 2001\u201302 season.
