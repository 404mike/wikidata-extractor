The courts were basic very with nets only 16 feet wide, posts with extended canes and chalked lines. The principal event organisers were Mr Richard Fleming St Andrew St John (Honorary Secretary of the BA) and Mr Percy Buckley (Secretary of the Guildford Badminton Association and President of the BA).

Her full name was Julia Margaret St.John. The evidence relating to her name is the fact that she was a member of the Ealing Club, as were her father Richard Fleming St Andrew St John (Honorary Secretary of the English Badminton Association), younger sister Catherine Frances Muriel St.John and older brother Richard Stukeley St.John. The latter two competed as a mixed doubles pairing at the 1900 All England Badminton Championships."]}]}}
