All of the main chronicler accounts carry significant regional biases in how they portray the disparate events. Several of the key chronicles were written in the south-west of England, including the Gesta Stephani, or \"Acts of Stephen\", and William of Malmesbury's Historia Novella, or \"New History\".Davis, p. 146. In Normandy, Orderic Vitalis wrote his Ecclesiastical History, covering Stephen's reign until 1141, and Robert of Torigni wrote a later history of the rest of the period. Henry of Huntingdon, who lived in the east of England, produced the Historia Anglorum that provides a regional account of the reign.Davis, pp. 147, 150. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was past its prime by the time of Stephen but is remembered for its striking account of conditions during \"the Anarchy\".Davis, p. 151. Most of the chronicles carry some bias for or against Stephen, Robert of Gloucester or other key figures in the conflict.Davis, pp. 146\u2013152. Those writing for the church after the events of Stephen's later reign, such as John of Salisbury for example, paint the King as a tyrant due to his argument with the Archbishop of Canterbury; by contrast, clerics in Durham regarded Stephen as a saviour, due to his contribution to the defeat of the Scots at the battle of the Standard.Barlow, p. 188. Later chronicles written during the reign of Henry II were generally more negative: Walter Map, for example, described Stephen as \"a fine knight, but in other respects almost a fool\".Stringer, p. 3.

Vampiric beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people.

His mother's identity is unclear. The medieval chronicler Walter Map claimed she was a whore named Ykenai, and that he was not actually Henry's son. This is the only contemporary source that gives her name, and as Map was hostile to Geoffrey, the information must be judged carefully. Instead, Ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight.
