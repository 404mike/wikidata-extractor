The books do not include businesses that provide therapeutic massage services. The term massage parlour is used in the title of the books because the term massage is commonly used in Britain to euphemistically advertise sex work, soliciting prostitution being illegal in the country. McCoy has also written several other guides to sexual services in Britain and appeared in the media to discuss the country's sex industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prostitution in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* George McCoy"]}, {"page": "McCoy (surname)", "response": ["*George McCoy, author of a guide to sexual services in Britain"]}, {"page": "McCoy's British Massage Parlour Guide", "response": ["#REDIRECT George McCoy Category:Handbooks and manuals"]}, {"page": "Punternet", "response": ["* George McCoy"]}, {"page": "Internet prostitution", "response": ["Books reviewing the providers of sexual services in the United Kingdom have been published by George McCoy since 1996 and by 2013 McCoy was running a website reviewing over 5,000 massage parlours and individuals."]}, {"page": "McCoy's Guide", "response": ["#REDIRECT George McCoy"]}, {"page": "McCoy, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge McCoy"]}]}}
