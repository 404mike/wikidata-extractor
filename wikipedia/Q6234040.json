The following year he returned to Edinburgh to work as an anaesthetist at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.  He was then appointed as anaesthetist to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE). Here he worked in the professorial surgical unit, initially  with  Sir John Fraser and subsequently with  Sir James Learmonth and latterly with Sir John Bruce. In 1940 Gillies set up the Department of Anaesthetics in the RIE, the first such in Scotland with two junior anaesthetists whose training he supervised. When  the National Health Service was established in 1948 he was appointed  Director of Anaesthesia. He determined to make anaesthetics an academic discipline in Edinburgh and recommended that anaesthetists in the RIE should have university status. He  was appointed lecturer in anaesthetics by the University. and was later promoted to  J Y Simpson Reader in anaesthesia."]}]}}
