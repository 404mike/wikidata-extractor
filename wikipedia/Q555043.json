The Sicilian was fairly popular for much of the nineteenth century; Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, Adolf Anderssen, Howard Staunton, Louis Paulsen, and Carl Jaenisch all played it with some consistency. In the ninth edition of Modern Chess Openings, Walter Korn noted that the Sicilian \"received three of its earliest practical tests, and a big boost in popularity, in the 1834 Alexander McDonnell [sic]\u2013La Bourdonnais match, 1843 Staunton\u2013St. Amant match, and the London 1851 chess tournament.\" Staunton wrote of the Sicilian, \"In the opinion of Jaenisch and the German Handbuch, with which I coincide, this is the best possible reply to 1.P-K4, [1.e4 in algebraic notation] 'as it renders the formation of a centre impracticable for White and prevents every attack.'\u00a0\" Modern players would consider the notion that the Sicilian \"prevents every attack\" naive.", "The Kalashnikov Variation (ECO code B32) is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variation, and is sometimes known as the Neo-Sveshnikov. The move 4...e5 has had a long history; Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais used it in his matches against Alexander McDonnell in 1834, and it was also popular for a short time in the 1940s. These earlier games focused on the L\u00f6wenthal Variation (similar to the Kalashnikov but the reply to 5.Nb5 is 5...a6) with 4...e5 5.Nb5 a6 6.Nd6+ Bxd6 7.Qxd6 Qf6, where Black gives up the two bishops to achieve a lead in development. The move fell out of use, however, once it was determined that White kept the advantage in these lines. Another fifth move alternative for Black is 5...Nf6, which can transpose into the Sveshnikov Variation after 6.N1c3 or 6.Bg5 d6 7.N1c3.", "2.f4 is the Grand Prix Attack or McDonnell Attack: the latter name stems from the 14th match game played in London in 1834 between Alexander McDonnell and Charles Louis Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, won by Black. According to Jeremy Silman and others, Black's best reply is 2...d5 3.exd5 Nf6!, the Tal Gambit, which has caused the immediate 2.f4 to decline in popularity.Tal Gambit Declined  jeremysilman.com White may decline the gambit with 3.Nc3, called the \"Toilet Variation\", so named after its reputed place of invention. A less common option is 2...e6, as La Bourdonnais played against McDonnell. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack nowadays by playing 2.Nc3 first before continuing 3.f4. The modern main line runs 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7. Here White can play the positional 5.Bb5, threatening to double Black's pawns with Bxc6, or the more aggressive 5.Bc4, aiming for a kingside attack."]}, {"page": "John Cochrane (chess player)", "response": ["Cochrane was one of the earliest notable British chess masters, his playing career beginning during those of Jacob Henry Sarratt (1772\u20131819) and William Lewis (1787\u20131870).

(obituary) In 1844 George Walker described Cochrane's approach to the game:\"Mr. Cochrane is the most brilliant player I have ever had the honour to look over or confront; not even excepting De la Bourdonnais; and pity it is that his very brilliancy so often mars success.\" Cochrane was also a well-known chess theoretician, although his innovations in the openings were generally unsound, and only he could get away with playing them."]}, {"page": "Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais", "response": ["La Bourdonnais was forced to earn his living as a professional chess player after squandering his fortune on ill-advised land deals.
