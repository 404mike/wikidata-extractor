In the first four tracts, he maintained that Germany is a nation of peace; England's political system is a sham, while Germany exhibits true freedom; German is the greatest and only remaining \"living\" language; and the world would be better off doing away with English and French-styled parliamentary governments in favour of German rule \"thought out by a few and carried out with iron consequence\". The final two discuss England and Germany at length.Chamberlain, Houston Stewart (1915) The Ravings of a Renegade: Being the War Essays of Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Charles H. Clark (trans.). London: Jarrold and Sons Chamberlain's basic argument was that democracy was an idiotic system as equality was a myth\u2014humans were very different with different abilities and talents, so democratic equality where the opinions of one voter mattered much as the opinions of the next was a completely flawed idea.Field (1981), pp. 368\u201369 Quoting the French scientist Gustave Le Bon, Chamberlain wrote the vast majority of people were simply too stupid to properly understand the issues, and as such Germany with its rule by elites was a much better governed nation than France.Field (1981), p. 369 In Germany, Chamberlain asserted, true freedom existed, as freedom came from the state alone which made it possible for society to function, not the individual as was the case in Britain and France, which Chamberlain claimed was a recipe for chaos.Field (1981), p. 368 Field summarized Chamberlain's thesis \"... the essence of German freedom was the willing submission as a matter of conscience to legitimately constituted authorities; it implied duty more than rights and was something spiritual and internal for which each moral being had to strive. Consigning 'liberty' to an inner, 'nonpolitical' moral realm, Chamberlain closed off any discussion of the specific conditions for a free society and simply asserted that freedom was perfectly compatible with an authoritarian system of government.\" Quoting\u2014sometimes wildly out of context\u2014various British, French and American authors, such as John Richard Green, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, John Robert Seeley, John Ruskin, Thomas Carlyle, Paul Bourget, Francis Delaisi, James Bryce, John Burgess, Woodrow Wilson, and H. G. Wells, Chamberlain argued that in democratic states, it was always big business that was really in charge; as such democracy was a fraud and democratic governments only served the rich; and democratic states only existed \"to further the interests of money making all over the globe\".Field (1981), pp. 367\u201371 Chamberlain's attacks on democracy as a sham designed to allow \"Jewish plutocrats\" to rule the world were not only very anti-British and anti-French, but also anti-American.Field (1981), pp. 368\u201371 Right from the start of the war, Chamberlain attacked all democratic governments in the world including the neutral United States as a fraud perpetrated by the Jews.Field (1981), pp. 370\u201371 Chamberlain wrote that America \"is a hellish whirlpool, in which all the contradictions of the world, all the greed, envy and lust brew and simmer; a wild struggle of millions of ignorant egotists, men without ideas, ideals, or traditions, without shared values, without any capacity for sacrifice, an atomic chaos endowed with no true power of nature\".Field (1981), p. 371 Until the United States entered the war in 1917, the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt worked hard to prevent Chamberlain's essays with their strong anti-American content from appearing abroad out of the fear that they would offend opinion in America. Chamberlain's wartime writings also gained much attention \u2013 albeit of a highly negative sort \u2013 in his native Britain, with The Times Literary Supplement declaring: \"The most ignorant of the Germans has not written greater nonsense.\"Field (1981), p. 366.
