Chopra initially refused the role, feeling she would not be able to do it justice. 6 months later, she agreed to appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.", "Chopra said she studied method acting to make her character seem real. The actress said that her character is determined and added, \"While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry\". Addressing rumours that the film was an expos\u00e9 of the fashion industry, she said, \"It is nothing like that. Whatever problems that come up to my character in the film are not because of the profession but because of the choices that my character makes in her life\". Ranaut said, \"In this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that you have never delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it was something new and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting.\" Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described as \"outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken\". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters."]}, {"page": "Soni (name)", "response": ["*Samir Soni, actor"]}, {"page": "List of Punjabi people", "response": ["* Samir Soni"]}, {"page": "A Mouthful of Sky", "response": ["* Samir Soni as Ashok Mathur"]}, {"page": "Hello Friends (TV series)", "response": ["*Samir Soni"]}]}}
