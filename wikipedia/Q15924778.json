Before a video was made for the previous single \"The Return of Pan\", Scott had refused to shoot videos for most of the Waterboys' singles. He considered the medium to taint the listener's relationship with a song and spoil their imagination of it by presenting imagery that was often \"shallow and moronic\". Scott suggested and controlled the vision for the video for \"The Return of Pan\", but was still left disappointed by the results as it was \"a thousand miles from the intent of the song\". As a result of that experience, Scott decided to give the director of \"Glastonbury Song\" the freedom to do as they wished.", "Scott received a number of ideas for the video from various directors, but he felt most were clich\u00e9d. After Geffen provided him with boxes of showreels from numerous directors, Scott opted to work with John Downer as he admired the director's video for Peter Gabriel's 1992 hit \"Digging in the Dirt\". Although Scott felt Downer's subsequent video treatment for \"Glastonbury Song\" contained a lot of clich\u00e9s and misinterpretations of the song's lyrics, he agreed to go along with it and flew from the United States to England to shoot it. In his autobiography, Scott recalled how he felt \"ill at ease\" during the shoot and looked awkward on camera. Downer's attempts to rectify that by directing him more closely only worsened Scott's experience, making him feel like \"a prisoner in my own promo: a kind of animated, patronised prop\"."]}, {"page": "Supersense", "response": ["Supersense is a six-part nature documentary television series produced by the BBC Natural History Unit, originally broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in 1988.
