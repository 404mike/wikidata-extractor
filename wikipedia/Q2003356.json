He was associated with nurseries at Stockwell, Fulham and Chelsea. In 1812 he joined Colvills, the famous Chelsea nursery, and was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society. By 1818 he was publishing horticultural and botanical works.\nHe published a number of beautifully illustrated works on plants cultivated in British gardens and hothouses. The fine plates were mainly drawn by Edwin Dalton Smith (1800\u20131883), a botanical artist, who was attached to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.  His works include Hortus Suburbanus Londinensis (1818), Geraniaceae (five volumes) (1820\u201330), Cistineae, Sweet's Hortus Britannicus (1826\u201327), Flora Australasica (1827\u201328) and British Botany (with H. Weddell) (1831).  He died at Chelsea, London in January 1835.\nHe was charged with receiving a batch of plants allegedly stolen from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. It was suggested that this was an attempt to frame him by an official at Kew whom Sweet had criticised. He was acquitted after a well-publicised trial.\nRobert Sweet received high praise from his contemporaries at his trial and was described as possibly the first practical botanist.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leucojum", "response": ["In 1807, Richard Anthony Salisbury illustrated two species in The Paradisus Londinensis. He initially used the name Leucojum autumnale for the plant illustrated in plate 21, but when discussing Leucojum pulchellum (now included in L.\u00a0aestivum), illustrated in plate 74, Salisbury noted the differences between the two species, and considered them sufficient to move Leucojum autumnale into a new genus, Acis. Although some botanists accepted the split between Leucojum and Acis, including Robert Sweet in 1829, most did not; for example, Brian Mathew in 1987 placed all the species in Leucojum. Acis was reinstated in 2004, after it was determined on morphological and molecular grounds that the broadly defined genus Leucojum was paraphyletic, with Acis and a more narrowly defined Leucojum being related as shown the following cladogram."]}, {"page": "Camellia sinensis", "response": ["Robert Sweet shifted all formerly Thea species to the genus Camellia in 1818..

Baxter sent to Clapton Nursery a package of Banksia seed labelled \"Dryandroides\", and this was successfully germinated. The species became part of \"the collection of Mr Mackay, at Clapton\", before being procured for \"the superb collection of the Comtesse de Vandes', at Bayswater\", where it flowered in cultivation for the first time. There it was seen by Robert Sweet, who in 1826 listed it under the unpublished manuscript name \"Banksia dryandroides\" as having been in cultivation in British gardens since 1824. Two years later, Sweet published a formal description of the species in his Flora Australasica, accompanied by a hand-coloured engraving by Edwin Dalton Smith. Thus B.\u00a0dryandroides became the first published of the 18 Banksia species discovered by Baxter; the remaining 17 would be published in Robert Brown's 1830 Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae, based on Baxter's specimen sheets.Baxter discovered 10 species of Banksia sensu stricto; see Collins (2008): 8.

The seed was likely originally collected near King George Sound by William Baxter. Banksia alliacea was known as Dryandra pteridifolia for many years until a 1996 revision of Dryandra by Alex George, who determined that D. pteridifolia was a separate species and resurrected the name Dryandra nervosa. It was then known as Dryandra nervosa until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As the name \"Banksia nervosa\" had already been published by Otto Kuntze for the plant now known as Pimelea angustifolia, Mast and Thiele were forced to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"alliacea\", is from the Latin alliaceus (\"onion-like\"), in reference to scent of the flowers."]}]}}
