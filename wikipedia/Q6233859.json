Martin Thorpe, writing in The Guardian described it as a \"rough, tough affair\" in which six players were shown the yellow card, and although Plymouth had more chances to score, the match ended goalless.  The second leg took place three days later at Home Park in Plymouth.  The home side took the lead a quarter of an hour into the match through Dwight Marshall: Burnley failed to clear a free-kick from Paul Dalton and the ball fell to Marshall who struck it past Marlon Beresford, the Burnley goalkeeper.  John Francis then levelled the score in the 29th minute, beating the goalkeeper after a \"marvellous run\".  Two minutes later he doubled his and Burnley's tally, scoring after receiving a pass from Adrian Heath. Warren Joyce scored with nine minutes remaining to make the final score 3\u20131 and Burnley progressed to the final with an aggregate victory of the same scoreline.", "|10||John Francis  "]}]}}
