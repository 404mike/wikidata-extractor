Wainwright is rather more down-to-earth than Weisel, and tends to give more practical advice. She knows Sir Humphrey's tricks and is able to give the Prime Minister instant advice how to get past his manipulations. Sir Humphrey is aware of this and sees her as a threat. He usually condescendingly addresses her as \"Dear Lady\", rather than using her name. Earlier Prime Ministerial advisers had appeared from time to time in episodes of Yes Minister, including Daniel Moynihan as Daniel Hughes in \"The Writing on the Wall\" (1980) and Nigel Stock as Sir Mark Spencer in \"Bed of Nails\" (1982). In the later stage play and 2013 television revival, Hacker's young advisor, Claire Sutton, had a larger role than any of her predecessors.", "The first series of Yes, Prime Minister introduced Dorothy Wainwright (played by Deborah Norton) as a highly able special political adviser to the Prime Minister. Her experience and insight into many civil service tricks ensure a lasting mutual distrust between her and Sir Humphrey and provide an invaluable second opinion for Hacker.

At his wife's insistence, Erik joins the Nazi Party to earn income and rapidly advances within the SS. In a short time he becomes the right-hand man of Reinhard Heydrich (David Warner), the top-level Nazi and one of the engineers of the \"Final Solution\". Coordinating mass murder bothers Dorf at first, but he grows more merciless as he discovers that ideological fervor gains him prestige. This backfires after a feud with SS field officers who resent his orders and they send an anonymous letter to Heydrich, accusing Dorf of having Communist sympathies. These accusations stunt his career. After Heydrich is assassinated in 1942, Dorf is put in charge of major extermination operations at Nazi death camps. Dorf continues to follow orders, and commits further war crimes as well as covering them up.", "* Deborah Norton as Marta Dorf"]}, {"page": "What the Butler Saw (play)", "response": ["* Deborah Norton \u2013 Mrs Prentice"]}, {"page": "Friends' School, Saffron Walden", "response": ["* Deborah Norton, actress"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1972", "response": ["|Adult Fun||James Scott||Peter Marinker, Deborah Norton||Comedy/thriller|| "]}, {"page": "The Wildcats of St Trinian's", "response": ["* Deborah Norton as Miss Brenner"]}, {"page": "Harold Shipman: Doctor Death", "response": ["* Deborah Norton as Debra King"]}, {"page": "Health and Efficiency (TV series)", "response": ["The show starred Gary Olsen and Roger Lloyd-Pack who both starred in 2point4 Children, as well as Victor McGuire and Deborah Norton.", "* Deborah Norton - Diana Ewerts"]}, {"page": "One (radio series)", "response": ["Performers include Graeme Garden, Dan Antopolski, Simon Greenall, Lizzie Roper, and Deborah Norton.
