At cricket, he was a right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler who played two first-class matches for the Ireland cricket team, also playing for Lancashire. In rugby union, he was a fly-half who played 19 times for the Ireland national rugby union team, scoring 72 points, and was regarded as one of the best goal kickers of the time. He is rated by his school, Portora Royal School, as one of their most famous pupils, alongside Samuel Beckett and Oscar Wilde.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portora Royal School", "response": ["*Dickie Lloyd, cricketer and rugby union player."]}, {"page": "Ronald Poulton", "response": ["Moving to Liverpool, Poulton played for Liverpool Football Club (which later merged with St Helen's RUFC to form Liverpool St Helens FC) under the captaincy of Freddie Turner, a former Oxford teammate, and captain of Scotland. The team also included Dickie Lloyd, Ireland's flyhalf and captain, so that the club had in the 1913\u201314 season three international rugby captains of the same era. The club lost 57 members in the First World War, including both Turner and Poulton.", "Poulton was appointed captain of England in 1914, and led the team for all four matches of the Five Nations Championship, and a second successive 'Grand Slam', though the term had not yet been coined. The first match was against Wales, and England only just managed to win. For the next game, against Ireland, a large police contingent was posted outside the ground in anticipation of violent protests relating to the Home rule debate, but the 40,000 crowd were peaceable and kept entertained. The Irish flyhalf and captain that day was Poulton's Liverpool teammate Dickie Lloyd, who praised Poulton as 'the greatest player I ever came in contact with\u00a0... It was as much a pleasure to play against him as with him for he was always the same fascinating figure\u00a0...' The next match was against Scotland for the Calcutta Cup and the Triple Crown. England, through a hat-trick of tries from Lowe, got ahead 16\u20136, but Scotland fought back to within one point."]}, {"page": "List of Ireland national rugby union players", "response": ["|Dickie Lloyd"]}]}}
