The newcomers are known to have included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, and there is evidence of other groups as well. These groups captured territory in the east and south of England, but at about the end of the fifth century, a British victory at the battle of Mount Badon (Mons Badonicus) halted the Anglo-Saxon advance for fifty years.Hunter Blair, An Introduction, pp. 13\u201316.Campbell et al., The Anglo-Saxons, p. 23. From about 550, however, the British began to lose ground once more, and within twenty-five years it appears that control of almost all of southern England was in the hands of the invaders.Peter Hunter Blair (Roman Britain, p. 204) gives the twenty-five years from 550 to 575 as the dates of the final conquest."]}, {"page": "Wessex", "response": ["Theories about the settlement of Saxons, Jutes and Angles in Britain are divided into two categories by the historian Peter Hunter Blair (1956), namely \"Welsh\" and \"English\". The Welsh tradition is exemplified by Gildas, in De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae. In brief, it states that after the Romans left, the Celtic Britons managed to continue for a time without any major disruptions. However, when finally faced with northern invaders, a certain unnamed ruler in Britain (called \"a proud tyrant\" by Gildas) requested assistance from the Saxons in exchange for land. There were no conflicts between the British and the Saxons for a time, but following \"a dispute about the supply of provisions\" the Saxons warred against the British and severely damaged parts of the country. In time, however, some Saxon troops left Britain; under Ambrosius Aurelianus, the British subsequently defeated those who remained. A lengthy conflict ensued, in which neither side gained any decisive advantage until the Britons routed the Saxons at the Battle of Mons Badonicus. After this, there occurred a peaceful period for the Britons, under which Gildas was living at the time he wrote the De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae.Blair 2003, pp. 13\u201314 One of the \"English\" traditions about the Saxon arrival concerns Hengest and Horsa. When Bede wrote his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, he adapted Gildas' narrative and added details, such as the names of those involved. To the \"proud tyrant\" he gave the name Vortigern, and the Saxon commanders he named Hengest and Horsa. Further details were added to the story in the Historia Brittonum, which was partially written by Nennius. According to the Historia, Hengest and Horsa fought the invaders of Britain under the condition of gaining the Island of Thanet. The daughter of Hengest, Rowena, later arrived on a ship of reinforcements, and Vortigern married her. However, a war arose in Kent due to a dispute between Hengest and Vortigern's son. After losing several battles, the Saxons finally defeated the British by treacherously attacking them once the two parties had convened for a meeting. Some additional details of the Hengest and Horsa legend are found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The Chronicle then records subsequent Saxon arrivals, including that of Cerdic, the founder of Wessex, in 495.Blair 2003, pp. 14\u201316"]}, {"page": "Offa of Mercia", "response": ["In Anglo-Saxon England, Stenton argued that Offa was perhaps the greatest king of the English kingdoms, commenting that \"no other Anglo-Saxon king ever regarded the world at large with so\u00a0... acute a political sense\".Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0224. Many historians regard Offa's achievements as second only to Alfred the Great among the Anglo-Saxon kings.For example, Peter Hunter Blair describes him as \"perhaps the greatest of all the Anglo-Saxon kings, save only Alfred\"; Blair, Introduction, p. 53. Offa's reign has sometimes been regarded as a key stage in the transition to a unified England, but this is no longer the general view among historians in the field. In the words of Simon Keynes, \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\" It is now believed that Offa thought of himself as \"King of the Mercians,\" and that his military successes were part of the transformation of Mercia from an overlordship of midland peoples into a powerful and aggressive kingdom.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0114."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelwulf, King of Wessex", "response": ["In the twenty-first century he is seen very differently by historians. \u00c6thelwulf is not listed in the index of Peter Hunter Blair's An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England, first published in 1956, but in a new introduction to the 2003 edition Keynes listed him among people \"who have not always been accorded the attention they might be thought to deserve\u00a0... for it was he, more than any other, who secured the political fortune of his people in the ninth century, and who opened up channels of communication which led through Frankish realms and across the Alps to Rome\". According to Story: \"\u00c6thelwulf acquired and cultivated a reputation both in Francia and Rome which is unparalleled in the sources since the height of Offa's and Coenwulf's power at the turn of the ninth century\"."]}, {"page": "Aldhelm", "response": ["Modern historians have contrasting views of his writings. Peter Hunter Blair compares him unfavourably to Bede: \"In the mind of his older contemporary, Aldhelm, learning of equal depth produced little more than an extravagant form of intellectual curiosity...Like Bede he drank deeply from the streams of Irish and Mediterranean scholarship, but their waters produced in him a state of intellectual intoxication which delighted its beholders, but which left little to posterity.\" However, Michael Lapidge praises his immense learning, observing that his knowledge of Latin texts is greater than any other pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxon writer, and that \"the originality and importance of his corpus of Latin writings well justifies his status as the first English man of letters\"."]}, {"page": "Wilfrid", "response": ["The historian Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: \"Wilfrid left a distinctive mark on the character of the English church in the seventh century. He was not a humble man, nor, so far as we can see, was he a man greatly interested in learning, and perhaps he would have been more at home as a member of the Gallo-Roman episcopate where the wealth which gave him enemies in England would have passed unnoticed and where his interference in matters of state would have been less likely to take him to prison.\"Blair World of Bede p. 152 R. W. Southern, another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was \"the greatest papal enthusiast of the century\".Southern Western Society pp. 57\u201358 James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him \"He was certainly one of the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman.\"Campbell \"Bede I\" Essays in Anglo-Saxon History p. 16"]}, {"page": "Paulinus of York", "response": ["There is some difficulty with Bede's chronology on the date of \u00c6thelburh's marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede's chronology. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and \u00c6thelburh must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624, and that Paulinus went north, not as a bishop, but as a priest, returning later to be consecrated. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting agrees with Kirby's reasoning.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 66 Another historian, Peter Hunter Blair, argues that \u00c6thelburh and Edwin were married before 625, but that she did not go to Northumbria until 625.Kirby Earliest English Kings pp. 33\u201334 If Kirby's arguments are accepted, then the date of Paulinus's consecration needs to be changed by a year, to 21 July 626.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 206 footnote 2"]}, {"page": "\u00c6lfric of Eynsham", "response": ["\u00c6lfric of Eynsham (; ; ) was an English abbot and a student of \u00c6thelwold of Winchester, and a consummate, prolific writer in Old English of hagiography, homilies, biblical commentaries, and other genres.

Blair, Northumbria, p. 53\u201354, writes of Aldfrith as \"a man perhaps not so very far removed from the Platonic ideal of the Philosopher king\" and as \"one of Northumbria's first and greatest scholars\".
