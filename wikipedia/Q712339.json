The tickets would be numbered by hand, and validated by a separate date-stamping press when purchased. He also invented and built a foot-operated version of the latter device.\nWhen the Manchester and Leeds Railway opened in 1839 Edmondson became the company's chief booking clerk at Manchester.\nThe invention which made Edmondson's fortune was his final development: a machine which would print tickets in batches complete with the serial numbers. He patented this machine, and was able to charge a royalty to railway companies amounting to ten shillings  per annum per mile of the company's routes.\nHis machines and their improved successors quickly became the standard for British and other railways. He died a wealthy man; members of his family carried on the business for many years  afterwards.\nThe South Tynedale Railway based at Alston in Cumbria operates an 0-4-0 Henschel designed steam locomotive named for Thomas Edmondson on the 125th anniversary of his card ticket invention.
