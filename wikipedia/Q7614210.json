His father is former Stoke City manager, Tony Waddington.\nA midfielder, he made 201 league appearances in an eight-year career in the Football League. He began his career at Stoke City in 1976, before moving on to Walsall three years later. He joined Port Vale in July 1982, before transferring to Chesterfield in July 1983. He moved on to non-league club Macclesfield Town the following year. He played very minor roles in promotion campaigns for both Stoke and Vale, though played a much bigger part in Walsall's promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1979\u201380.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Waddington (surname)", "response": ["* Steve Waddington, an English footballer"]}, {"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["Promotion was eventually achieved with a third-place finish in 1982\u201383.

He made five free signings: John Ridley (a former Valiant), Wayne Cegielski (Wrexham), Les Lawrence (Torquay United), Steve Waddington (Walsall), and Barry Siddall (Sunderland). He further sold Neville Chamberlain to Stoke for \u00a340,000, bringing in burly striker Bob Newton from Hartlepool United for \u00a315,000. Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign. He bought striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, whilst letting Ernie Moss go to Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee after judging him to be too old to be of any further use.

Four of the more important newcomers were John Ridley, Wayne Cegielski, Les Lawrence and Steve Waddington. In August, Mark Chamberlain and Mark Harrison were sold to rival's Stoke for a combined fee of \u00a3180,000. There was little option to sell due to the financial situation, though McGrath's plans were heavily disrupted. As a result, five players made their d\u00e9buts on the opening game of the season. A bold attempt to sign Mick Channon failed, forcing McGrath to settle for dedicated forward Bob Newton. The season finished with promotion, third place with seven points to spare.

He spent the 1982\u201383 campaign with league rivals Darlington, and played 12 games before he was released by manager Billy Elliott. He moved into non-League football with Stafford Rangers, Witton Albion, Macclesfield Town, and Newcastle Town.

He played five Fourth Division games under Dennis Butler in 1978\u201379, before becoming a first team regular under new boss John McGrath from February 1980 to the end of the 1979\u201380 season. He scored his first goal in the Football League on 9 February 1980, in a 1\u20131 draw with Huddersfield Town. He fell out of favour the next season though, and was restricted to 23 appearances before being handed a free transfer in May 1981.
