The next year the two entered into a formal partnership, with Ware holding a one-fourth interest, that lasted until 1791 when Ware started his own practice.\"Ware, James (1756-1815)\" in The Dictionary of National Biography Although Ware ultimately became the better known of the two, and was even admitted as a Fellow to the Royal Society, he acknowledged in print his debt to his mentor and former partner Jonathan Wathen.see the preface dedicated to Jonathan Wathen, Esq. in Ware, James (1905), Chirurgical observations relative to the eye, J.
