In February 2012, it was reported that Neville would help England's Under-21s coaching staff in the absence of Stuart Pearce in the Under-21 European Championship qualifier against Belgium. The Everton captain received a special dispensation to help Brian Eastick prepare the side for the game at the Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough as Pearce would be in charge of the senior team in the friendly against the Netherlands at Wembley. England defeated Belgium 4\u20130. Continuing his work with the England under-21 side, in March 2013 it was announced that Neville would join the coaching staff of the England under-21s for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship."]}, {"page": "Jordan Parkes", "response": ["Parkes signed his first professional contract with Watford on 1 February 2007.

Bath were relegated to the Southern League out of the Conference in the 1987\u201388 season, though in January 1988 Bodin went in the opposite direction as he made a return to the English Football League with Brian Eastick's Newport for a \u00a315,000 transfer fee, who themselves were heading for relegation at the end of the season. Newport's financial difficulties meant that Bath never received payment for Bodin's transfer."]}, {"page": "Krystian Pearce", "response": ["In September 2007 Pearce was called up to the England under-19 squad for the qualifying tournament for the 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, despite being a year younger than most of the squad. He played the whole of England's first two games and was rested for the third, coming on at half time and scoring the third goal in a 3\u20131 win. Called up for a friendly against Russia under-19 in March 2008, Pearce was withdrawn and allowed to play for his loan club Port Vale, on the grounds that both England under-19 coach Brian Eastick and Birmingham City saw \"playing in a League One game against Gillingham as being beneficial to his development\". He was part of the under-19 squad that topped their group at the elite qualification stage, starting in their second match and coming on as a very late substitute in the third. In England's first group match in the finals, a lack of communication between Pearce and his goalkeeper cost England a goal against their Czech counterparts. He retained his starting place for the remaining group games, keeping clean sheets in a goalless draw with Italy, where he made a vital late interception, and a 3\u20130 defeat of Greece. Though England failed to reach the semifinals, their performance was good enough to qualify for the final stages of the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup."]}, {"page": "Birmingham City F.C.
