The debate was moderated by Mike McArdell of Global TV. Lytton-Cobbold provided a spirited and crowd-inspiring defence of his ancestor, and despite a factual and well-researched presentation by Rice, Lytton-Cobbold emerged as the crowd favourite by a wide margin. In the end, Rice begrudgingly admitted to an admiration of Bulwer-Lytton. This event was held as part of the Village of Lytton's BC150 celebrations, as it was the 150th anniversary of the community receiving its name, in addition to the province-wide celebration of the establishment of the original Colony of British Columbia on August 2, 1858."]}, {"page": "Knebworth", "response": ["*Henry Lytton-Cobbold"]}, {"page": "Knebworth House", "response": ["As of 2019, its residents are Henry Lytton-Cobbold and his family.

He said that it was \"rather unfair that Professor Rice decided to name the competition after him for entirely the wrong reasons.\"] The phrase \"the almighty dollar\", however, had been used earlier by Washington Irving."]}, {"page": "David Lytton-Cobbold, 2nd Baron Cobbold", "response": ["* Henry Lytton-Cobbold b. 12 May 1962; the heir, and current occupier of the family seat Knebworth House"]}, {"page": "Henry Cobbold", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Lytton-Cobbold"]}, {"page": "Lytton (surname)", "response": ["* Henry Lytton-Cobbold (born 1962), English screenwriter and country house manager"]}]}}
