His disinclination for studies led his family to purchase him a commission in the Rifle Brigade in 1825; in 1833, he obtained a captaincy in the Connaught Rangers. He rose to become lieutenant-colonel commanding that regiment in 1848 and led it to the Crimean War in 1854. During the Siege of Sevastopol, Shirley supervised a successful attack on the Quarries in front of the Great Redan and received the CB and command of a brigade. Wounded in the Battle of the Great Redan, he returned home on leave and commanded troops in Great Britain and Ireland until 1861. Made a K.C.B. and a general in retirement, he became colonel of his old regiment before his death in 1879.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
