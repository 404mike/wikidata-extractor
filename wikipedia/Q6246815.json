As noted above, A History of the University in Europe lists Durham as the third oldest university in England, and Oxford historian William Whyte similarly states: \"Thus it was that the first new university for almost 250 years was founded\u2014and funded\u2014by the amply endowed Bishop of Durham.

The historian and politician Sir John Marriott also named Durham as the third university, saying \"A third University had been established at Durham in 1832, and four years later London University came into being, but only as an examining body, until in 1900 it was endowed with the full status of a teaching University with a number of constituent colleges.\" Other historians generally concur, with some stating that \"using the date of the incorporating Act of Parliament or Royal Charter as the founding date\" is \"accepted practice\" in naming Durham as third."]}, {"page": "John Arthur Ransome Marriott", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Marriott (British politician)"]}, {"page": "Maurice Francis Egan", "response": ["*  Maurice Francis Egan's 1922 review of a book by John Marriott."]}, {"page": "John Marriott", "response": ["John Marriott may refer to:", "*John Marriott (poet) (1780\u20131825), English poet and clergyman", "*Sir John Marriott (British politician) (1859\u20131945), British historian and member of Parliament", "*John Marriott (actor) (1893\u20131977), American actor", "*John Marriott (Australian politician) (1913\u20131994), Australian Senator", "*Sir John Marriott (philatelist) (1922\u20132001), British philatelist, Keeper of the Royal Philatelic Collection", "*John Marriott (footballer), Australian rules footballer in the SANFL"]}, {"page": "John Arthur Marriott", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Marriott (British politician)"]}, {"page": "Stubbs Society", "response": ["*Sir John Marriott - Educationist and Conservative Member of parliament "]}, {"page": "Marriott (surname)", "response": ["* John Marriott (British politician) (1859\u20131945), English political economist and historian"]}, {"page": "1917 Oxford by-election", "response": ["The Oxford by-election of 1917 was held on 30 March 1917.
