It is located to the northwest of the Hellas impact basin within the furthest outskirts of the Hellas debris apron. The crater is 165\u00a0km in diameter and likely formed during the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of intense bolide impacts affecting the entirety of the Solar System; during the Hesperian period, aeolian processes caused significant degradation of the crater's rim features and infilled the crater's floor (which is nearly at the same elevation as the surrounding plains terrain). Similar to other large craters in this region of Mars, wind-eroded features are sporadically found on the basin floor. The presence of wrinkle ridges of varying orientations within and around the Denning basin has been correlated to regional tectonic events, including the formation of the Hellas basin itself. The crater was named for British astronomer William Frederick Denning."]}, {"page": "72P/Denning\u2013Fujikawa", "response": ["72P/Denning\u2013Fujikawa is a periodic comet discovered on 4 October 1881 by William Frederick Denning.
