From 1844 to 1848 he toured Europe and Great Britain and by the time he returned to Australia he had married a Stirling lass, Mary Isabella Morrison. The farm prospered, allowing him to represent the area in the Tasmanian parliament. His wife survived him and continued to run the property for the next twenty three years.\nHe was father of Donald Norman Cameron (MHR for Tasmania 1901\u201303, MHA 1904-06) and Cyril St Clair Cameron (Senator for Tasmania 1901-03) and grandfather of Donald Keith Cameron (MHA 1934-37).", "link_mentions": {}}}
