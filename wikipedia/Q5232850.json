He was born on 9 February 1742 of Welsh parentage at Machynlleth and educated at Codrington College, Barbados and Jesus College, Oxford. His father was Richard Davies.\nHe was Rector of Barkham in Berkshire, England, from 1781 until his death.\nDavies studied the condition of the labouring poor, recorded statistics of their wages, cost of food, etc. in various districts of England and Scotland. A controversial rapid rise in Poor Law costs at the time (especially in rural parishes) instigated debates on the issue, and inspired Davies to compile statistics from which he produced data covering the income and expenditure of certain families in the country (including three in the parishes of Llandegla and Llanarmon (Denbighshire), and two in the parishes of Llanfor and Llanycil (Merioneth).\nHe published his findings in 1795 as a book called Cases of Labourers in Husbandry Stated and Considered in Three Parts, an important work in social history. Part 1, Section 2 contains what is considered the first usage of household surveys. Davies claims to have collected 2\u20133 surveys from every county in the kingdom with the help of his friends. From these surveys, poor households on average spent 75% of their income on food. \nThrough this publication, Davies called for a marked improvement in the standard of living for agricultural labourers. He demonstrated that the 'Poor Rates' were used as a means to keep wages down. He presented calculations in Section 7, which show that the number of days an average laborer had to work to afford a quarter of wheat doubled between the 14th century and the 18th century. For policy recommendations, he advocated the principle of a minimum wage.He died on 6 February 1819 at Barkham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Davies", "response": ["David Davies may refer to:", "*David Davies (industrialist) (1818\u20131890), also known as David Davies Llandinam, MP for Cardigan, 1874\u20131885, and Cardiganshire, 1885\u20131886", "*David Davies (Australian politician) (c. 1840\u20131894), politician in colonial Victoria, Australia", "*David Davies (textile merchant) (1852\u20131934), Liberal politician, MP for Denbigh 1918\u20131922", "*Sir David Davies (dairyman) (1870\u20131958), Conservative politician", "*David Davies (Welsh politician) (born 1970), Welsh Conservative politician, and British Member of Parliament elected in 2005", "*David Davies (English actor), English actor", "*David Davies (Welsh actor) (1906\u20131974), Welsh actor", "*David Davies (artist) (1864\u20131939), Australian artist", "*David Davies (author) (1741\u20131819), Welsh author", "*David Davies (composer) (1810\u20131875), Welsh composer of \"Glan'rafon\"", "*David Davies (harpist) (1817\u20131855), Welsh harpist", "*David Davies (musician) (born 1954), British flautist, conductor and composer", "*David Davies (football administrator) (born 1948), former Executive Director of the (English) Football Association", "*David Davies (footballer, born 1879) (1879\u20131956), Brecon F.C., Hereford Town F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*David Davies (footballer, born 1888) (1888\u2013?), Oldham Athletic F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*David Davies (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s, and 1910s for Wales, Merthyr Tydfil, Swinton, and Oldham", "*David Davies (rugby league, born 1902) (1902\u20131992), rugby league footballer of the 1920s, and 1930s for Wales, and Broughton, Warrington, Huddersfield and Keighley", "*David Davies (rugby league, born c. 1915), rugby league footballer of the 1930s, and 1940s for Wales, and Salford", "*David Davies (swimmer) (born 1985), British long-distance swimmer", "*David Davies (electrical engineer) (born 1935), professor of electrical engineering at UCL; MoD Chief Scientific Adviser, 1993\u20131999", "*David Davies (Archdeacon of Llandaff) (1858\u20131930), Welsh clergyman", "*David Davies (Baptist minister) (1800\u20131856)", "*David Davies (Dean of Wellington) (1912\u20131987), Welsh clergyman in New Zealand", "*David Davies (Independent minister and magazine editor) (died 1807), Welsh editor of \"Y Geirgrawn\"", "*David Davies (Welsh priest) (1742\u20131819), Welsh clergyman in the Church of England", "*David Davies, 1st Baron Davies (1880\u22121944), Liberal MP for Montgomershire 1906\u20131929, grandson of the industrialist David Davies (see above)", "*David Davies, 2nd Baron Davies (1915\u22121944), major in the Royal Welch Fusiliers", "*David Davies, 3rd Baron Davies (born 1940), British peer and engineer", "*David Davies (Dai'r Cantwr) (1812\u20131874), Welsh activist sentenced for his part in the Rebecca Riots", "*David Davies (physician) (1792\u20131865), Welsh physician"]}, {"page": "List of clergy educated at Jesus College, Oxford", "response": ["Some students became ministers in other denominations of Christianity.
