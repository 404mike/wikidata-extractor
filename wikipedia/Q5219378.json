Trust, who called the storyline an \"unhelpful portrayal\" and said it had already received calls from members of the public who were \"distressed about the EastEnders scene where a social worker snatches a baby from its mother's arms\". The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC \"too lazy and arrogant\" to correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken \"without sufficient grounds to do so\". Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked \"real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs ..
