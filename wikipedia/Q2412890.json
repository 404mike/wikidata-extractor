Biggles made his first appearance in the story The White Fokker, published in the first issue of Popular Flying magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, The Camels Are Coming (both 1932). Johns continued to write \"Biggles books\" until his death in 1968. The series eventually included nearly a hundred volumes \u2013 novels as well as short story collections \u2013 most of the latter with a common setting and time.\nThe chronology of the canon, spanning both world wars, set up certain inconsistencies over the unavoidable ageing of Biggles and his friends.

The first appearance of the Spanish Inquisition characters occurs in a drawing room set in \"Jarrow, 1912,\" with a title card featuring a modern British urban area with a nuclear power plant. A mill worker (Graham Chapman) enters the room and tells a woman sitting on a couch knitting (Carol Cleveland) in a thick accent that \"one of the cross beams has gone out askew on the treadle\". When the woman says that she can't understand what he's talking about, the mill worker repeats the line, this time without the thick accent, then grows defensive and says, \"I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition!\" Suddenly, the Inquisitionconsisting of Cardinal Xim\u00e9nez (Michael Palin) and his assistants, Cardinal Biggles (Terry Jones) (who resembles his namesake Biggles wearing a leather aviator's helmet and goggles) and Cardinal Fang (Terry Gilliam)burst into the room to the sound of a jarring musical sting. Xim\u00e9nez shouts, with a particular and high-pitched emphasis on the first word: \"NO-body expects the Spanish Inquisition!\"", "After entering, Xim\u00e9nez begins enumerating their weapons (\"fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, nice red uniforms\"), but interrupts himself as he keeps forgetting to mention additional weapons and has to begin numbering his list over again. After several attempts, Xim\u00e9nez states that he will come in again, and herds the Inquisition back off the set. The straight man mill worker repeats the cue line, the Inquisition bursts back in (complete with jarring chord), and the introduction is tried anew. But Xim\u00e9nez fails again and tries to get Cardinal Biggles to do the introduction, but Biggles is also unsuccessful.", "Xim\u00e9nez decides to forget the introduction and has Cardinal Fang read out charges of heresy against the woman. The woman pleads \"innocent\", and the cardinals respond with laughter (as an on-screen caption reads \"DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER\") and threats (as the on-screen caption changes to \"DIABOLICAL ACTING\"). Xim\u00e9nez intends to torture the woman with \"the rack\", but Cardinal Biggles instead produces a dish-drying rack. This rack is tied to the woman and Biggles pretends to turn a lever, but it has no effect whatsoever. As they work, the mill worker answers the door to find a BBC employee (John Cleese) requesting him to open a door for a gag on \"the neighboring sketch\", leading into the \"Jokes and Novelties Salesman\" segment. ", "Biggles tries to torture the woman by poking her repeatedly with soft cushions. When this fails, Xim\u00e9nez orders Fang to get \"the comfy chair\", which is brought out and the woman placed in it. Xim\u00e9nez states that she must stay in the chair \"until lunch time with only a cup of coffee at 11\", and begins to shout at her to confessonly to have Biggles break down and confess. This frustrates Xim\u00e9nez, but he cannot complain about it since he is distracted by a cartoon character from the next scene.", "In the Monty Python Live (Mostly) stage show, the sketch ends when Xim\u00e9nez orders Biggles to \"torture\" the victim (who is sitting in the comfy chair) by giving her a glass of cold milk from the fridge.

Johns: best known for creating the fictional air-adventurer Biggles.", "Johns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book Biggles Goes to School (1951). In the summer of 1907, he was apprenticed to a county municipal surveyor for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in Swaffham in Norfolk. Soon afterwards, his father died of tuberculosis at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914, Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882\u20131961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of Little Dunham, Norfolk. Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.", "During this time Johns's probationary commission was confirmed. He continued to serve as a flying instructor until August 1918, when he transferred to No. 55 Squadron RAF, at the time part of the Independent Air Force, a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing targets deep inside Germany. Casualties in the Independent Air Force were high and Johns' career flying strategic bombing missions was characteristically short, lasting only six weeks. On 16 September 1918, he was piloting one of six DH.4s on their way to bomb Mannheim when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single  bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of Fokker D.VII fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns' observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to Georg Weiner, the commander of Jagdstaffel 3. Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day.Amey's medals were sold at auction in the United Kingdom in 2005, in a lot that included a letter to his family from Johns, describing the circumstances of his death (see: Bosleys 2005, Lot 556). In the preface of Biggles Pioneer Air Fighter (1954), on page vi, Johns wrote: \"Lieutenant A. E. Amey, who fought his first and last fight beside me, had not even unpacked his kit!\" Johns remained a prisoner of war until after the Armistice of 11 November 1918.", "W. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor.

After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine Popular Flying which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of Popular Flying that Biggles first appeared.", "The first Biggles book, The Camels are Coming (a reference to the Sopwith Camel aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to \"William Earle\", but later Johns adopted the more familiar \"Capt. W. E. Johns\". While his apparent final RAF rank of flying officer was equivalent to an army (or RFC) lieutenant, captain is commonly used for the commander of a vessel or aircraft.", "Johns was also a regular contributor to The Modern Boy magazine in the late 1930s as well as editing (and writing for) both Popular Flying and Flying. From the early 1930s, Johns called for the training of more pilots, for if there were not enough when war came, \"training would have to be rushed, and under-trained airmen would die in accidents or in combat against better trained German pilots.\"Patrick Cockburn, \"Biggles flies uncensored: more whisky, less jingoism.\" The Independent, Sunday 17 November 2013 Retrieved 23 November 2013. He was removed as editor at the beginning of 1939, probably as a direct result of a scathing editorial, strongly opposed to the policy of appeasement and highly critical of several Conservative statesmen of the time. Cockburn, however, feels that the government was concerned about being so \"expertly attacked\" on the lack of trained pilots by the editor of the most widely read aviation magazines in the world, including readers \"in the RAF or connected with flying.\"Cockburn 2013.", "Johns' opposition to appeasement is reflected in some of his books. For example, in The Black Peril (1935) the storyline revolves around German preparations for conquest.
