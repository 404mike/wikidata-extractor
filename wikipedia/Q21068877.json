Coles obtained a position as a junior clerk with the Murray River Navigation office, but gave this up to become assistant dispenser and receiver of stores at the Adelaide hospital for three years. He then joined the mounted police and served for three years in the country. On leaving this service he became an auctioneer and stock salesman and a member of the real estate firm of Coles and Goodchild, with which James White was later associated. The business prospered so much that Coles was able to practically retire from it before he was 40. He was returned to the South Australian House of Assembly as member for Light in 1875, but did not stand at the 1878 election as he found that the strain of carrying on both business and parliamentary duties was too great. In 1881 he was elected for Light, afterwards merged into Wooroora, and represented the district for over 30 years. He was commissioner of crown lands from June 1884 to February 1885, and commissioner of public works from February to June 1885 in the second John Colton ministry and showed himself to be a vigorous administrator. He was commissioner of crown lands again in the Thomas Playford II ministry from June 1887 to June 1889. In 1890 he was elected speaker of the house of assembly in succession to Sir John Bray, and held the position until he resigned, about three weeks before his death of Bright's disease on 6 December 1911. He married in 1865 Ellen Henrietta Briggs, who survived him with four sons and seven daughters. Two of his sons founded the auctioneering firm Coles Brothers of Kapunda.
