Midway through the first half, Gary Jones put Grimsby into the lead from a Curtis Woodhouse cross.  Two further Lincoln goals were disallowed, one for a foul and one for offside, and both sides struck the goal frames, Paul Bolland for Grimsby and Scott Kerr for Lincoln; the match ended 1\u20130.  The second leg of the semi-final took place three days later at Blundell Park in Grimsby.  Marvin Robinson scored for Lincoln with a header from Kerr's free kick on 27 minutes.  Ben Futcher, who had come on as a substitute, levelled the match in the 60th minute.  Jones then scored from a Woodhouse free kick with ten minutes remaining to make it 2\u20131 to Grimsby, before being sent off in the last minute.  Grimsby progressed to the final with a 3\u20131 aggregate win."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["Stoke soon started to get their act together and began to find the back of the net regularly with Peterborough United beaten 3\u20130 and Oxford United 4\u20130 and a 3\u20133 draw away at Reading. The first Potteries derby ended 1\u20131 but in the next match against Rotherham United on-loan striker Marvin Robinson broke his leg in a nasty collision with the Rotherham goalkeeper. A last minute victory over Millwall was a vital win against a promotion rival and with the arrival of Dadason it seemed that Stoke could continue their push for an automatic position but two truly awful defeats in the FA and League Cup saw the feeling around the club drop and after a 3\u20131 defeat at home to bottom of the table Luton Town there was a major danger that those results could affect their league form. But City to their credit got their act together and went on a 13 match unbeaten run cementing their place in the play-offs.", "|align=\"left\"|32||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Marvin Robinson"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|26||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Marvin Robinson"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["* Marvin Robinson \u2013 Tranmere Rovers, 29 November"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|12||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Marvin Robinson"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Premier League goalscorers", "response": ["*Marvin Robinson \u2013 Derby County"]}, {"page": "Clarence Johnston (jazz drummer)", "response": ["* 1965: All That's Good - Freddie Roach, Conrad Lester, Calvin Newborn, Clarence Johnston, Marvin Robinson, Phyllis Smith, Willie Tate (Blue Note)"]}]}}
