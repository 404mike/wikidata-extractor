By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners  and , to be broken up at the yard.Wilkinson, p. 264 However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \"a waste of time\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\".Pickard, p. 26 These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \"a heroic failure\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\", and thus paved the way to social reform."]}, {"page": "Labour Party Conference", "response": ["* Real Britain: an event hosted by The Mirror it was chaired by journalist Kevin Maguire and had speakers such as John McDonnell, Len McCluskey and former footballer Neville Southall.

The group became more widely known in the public and media as the \"awkward squad\", after journalist Kevin Maguire coined the term in an article in The Guardian in 2001, in which he also reported that Rix had recently rejoined Labour after a period in the Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party. Rix insisted that the FUWL group had not to ape the left of the old days but had to include a senior officer, senior lay member and a trusted staffer, so that the decisions made at FUWL meetings would go through the various networks of union internal structures. FUWL insisted that it was not the preserve of males, and included the very powerful TUC women's network, along with the editor of the Morning Star. FUWL became a powerful block on the TUC. FUWL basically wrote the policy agenda and in 2001 it ended the right wing dominance at the TUC on policy, and in winning elections to the general council elections in a number of unions.
