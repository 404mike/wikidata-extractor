Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 London terrorist bomber Germaine Lindsay, is accused of causing the deaths of more than 400 people. She is a fugitive from justice in Kenya, where she was wanted on charges of possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony and is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice requesting her arrest with a view to extradition.Lewthwaite was alleged to be a member of the Somalia-based radical Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab. She was accused of orchestrating grenade attacks at non-Muslim places of worship, and is believed to have been behind an attack on those watching football in a bar in Mombasa during Euro 2012. In September 2013, there was speculation over her possible involvement in the Nairobi Westgate shopping mall attack, although other reports cast doubt on this, or said her role had been exaggerated. She was dubbed the \"White Widow\" by the news media, a play on words referencing her race and the death of her first husband and the practice of referring to Chechen female suicide bombers as \"black widows\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Irish people", "response": ["* Samantha Lewthwaite \u2013 terrorism suspect"]}, {"page": "Aylesbury", "response": ["* Samantha Lewthwaite, terrorist, grew up in Aylesbury"]}, {"page": "Germaine Lindsay", "response": ["Lindsay had converted to Islam shortly after his mother, Maryam McCleod Ismaiyl, converted to the faith in 2001 and encouraged him to do the same.
