The patriarch of the family, George Barnard, built a collection of insect and bird eggs and specialised in moths, butterflies and beetles. George's wife Maria was an artist who drew specimens.  George's collection grew so large that a private museum was built on the cattle station.  Upon his death, George Barnard's collection was acquired by Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild's Natural History Museum at Tring but his children continued similar work, making names for themselves with their own achievements.
