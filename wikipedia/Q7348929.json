Platt's position was that hypertension was a simple disease caused by perhaps just one genetic defect, and he presented evidence of its autosomal dominant inheritance and a bimodal distribution of blood pressures, indicating that hypertensives were a distinct subpopulation in humans.\nIn contrast, Pickering's viewpoint was that blood pressures varied continuously and unimodally, with hypertensives representing the upper end of the bell curve. Though Platt's view was favoured during his lifetime, Pickering's view ultimately dominated and is the basis of current understanding and treatment policies.\nDuring his lifetime, Platt held the salaried position of head of the Central Manchester Health authority, and he later (1957\u20131962) became the president of the Royal College of Physicians. During his presidency he was influential in the writing and publication of the first College report on Smoking and Health, which assembled all the evidence for a causative relationship. It predated the first report on smoking and lung cancer from the US Surgeon General, which appeared in 1964.\nOn 14 July 1959 he was made a Baronet 'of Grindleford'. On 16 January 1967 he was created a life peer as Baron Platt, of Grindleford, in the County of Derby. On his death the baronetcy was inherited by his son: the life peerage became extinct. His autobiography, titled Private and Controversial, was published in the UK by Cassell and Company in 1972.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Platt (author)", "response": ["Charles Platt (born 26 April 1945) is an author, journalist and computer programmer.
