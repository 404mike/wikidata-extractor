The author of Vulcan 607, Rowland White, claimed that Vice Admiral Juan Lombardo was led to believe that Black Buck One was the prelude to a full-scale landing by the British. As a consequence, he ordered Rear Admiral , the commander of the Argentine Sea Fleet, to immediately attack the British fleet. This attack took the form of a pincer movement, with the light cruiser  to the south and aircraft carrier  to the north. On 2 May, General Belgrano was sunk by the submarine . Thereafter the Argentine Navy withdrew to territorial waters and played no further part in the conflict."]}, {"page": "Battle of Mirbat", "response": ["* The battle is described in Rowland White's \"Storm Front\"."]}, {"page": "Rowland White", "response": ["Rowland White may refer to:", "* Rowland White (British writer) (born 1970), British writer on aviation", "* Rowland White (Irish writer) (died 1572), Irish writer, and political and religious reformer"]}]}}
