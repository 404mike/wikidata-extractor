His 1932 book Memoirs of a British Agent became an international bestseller and brought him to the world's attention by telling of his failed effort to sabotage the Bolshevik Revolution in Moscow in 1918. His co-conspirators were double agents working for the Bolsheviks. In the end, the \"Lockhart Plot\" was revealed as a cunning sting operation controlled by Felix Dzerzhinsky with the goal of discrediting the British and French governments.", "link_mentions": {}}}
