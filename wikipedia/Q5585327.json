Hunter, who scored very few goals in his career, got the winner for Hibs in an Edinburgh derby match in 1994 that ended a record 22-game unbeaten run by Heart of Midlothian in the derby.As of 2005, Hunter ran a taxi business in Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Canberra Cosmos FC", "response": ["Canberra's second season was much more forgettable however. In finishing last, the club ended the season 16 points behind second-last placed team.

This allowed the Cosmos to recruit the 1996\u201397 coach of the year Branko Culina and after losing their best players the previous year, Canberra was a net importer of quality players for this season.  New signings included Scottish defender Gordon Hunter from Hibernian, Sydney United midfielder Ante Moric and the return of Michael Musitano.  Unfortunately, this did not translate into on-field performance, winning only once in the first thirteen games\u00a0\u2013 a run including an 8\u20130 loss to Wollongong\u00a0\u2013 and only three times in the season (including a record 8\u20131 win over UTS).
