Richard Ridings provided voice-overs such as the mentor.Manual, p. 75. The music was composed by Russell Shaw and, according to Healey, this came late in development. The prospect of working on Dungeon Keeper motivated artist and former Bullfrog employee Gary Carr to return from The Bitmap Brothers (he had left Bullfrog because of a disagreement with Molyneux on Theme Park), but he was assigned to Theme Hospital instead. Healey produced 90 per cent of the graphics. Most of the creatures were the team members' ideas, although Molyneux was involved with the Imps. Healey designed the Horned Reaper (who is based on an ex-girlfriend of his), who ultimately become the game's mascot. According to Molyneux, each character takes 1024 bytes of memory. The game as it ended up was developed mostly in the final few months: the team started again from scratch long into the development cycle because they felt it played like Command & Conquer. Before the redesign, instead of having Imps dig the gold and minions entering through portals, the game had the player dig gold and use it and mana to create minions.
