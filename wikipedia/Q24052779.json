It became the fourth-largest party in the D\u00e1il and entered government in coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael. Ryan, Martin and Roderic O'Gorman were appointed as cabinet ministers, with four Green Ministers of State. Clare Bailey, the leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland, was amongst a number of Green members who stood against the coalition. She said it proposed the \"most fiscally conservative arrangements in a generation\" and that \"the economic and finances behind this deal will really lead to some of the most vulnerable being hit the hardest\", as well as it not doing enough on climate and social justice. She also said the deal \"fails to deliver on our promise to tackle homelessness and provide better healthcare\", \"represents an unjust recovery\" and \"sets out an inadequate and vague pathway towards climate action\". In the 2020 Seanad election the party returned two senators. A further two senators were nominated by Taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin bringing the total party representation in the Oireachtas to 16. In July 2020, Eamon Ryan retained his leadership of the party with a narrow leadership election victory over Catherine Martin in the 2020 Green Party leadership election by 994 votes to 946, a margin of 48 votes."]}, {"page": "List of political parties in the United Kingdom", "response": ["| Clare Bailey"]}, {"page": "List of political parties in Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Clare Bailey"]}, {"page": "Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["4.
