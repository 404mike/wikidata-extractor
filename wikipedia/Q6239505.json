Initially, he struggled to adapt and he preferred going to nightclubs over playing for Colchester, Harrop says, \"It took a lot of hard work by the staff at Colchester. Micky Cook, the director of youth, had to spend endless hours with him and [manager] Steve Wignall and then [the next manager] Steve Whitton had to spend a lot of time with him talking him through the tactical side of the game and what his role was within the team\". LuaLua scored within four minutes of his debut where he appeared as a substitute in a 3\u20131 defeat to Chesterfield. In two seasons, he made 68 league and cup appearances for Colchester, 44\u00a0starts and 24 substitute appearances, scoring a total of 21\u00a0goals. His performances attracted the attention of several Premiership clubs and despite manager Steve Whitton's denial that LuaLua was for sale, LuaLua joined Newcastle United in September 2000 for a fee of \u00a32.25\u00a0million. An earlier offer by Newcastle of \u00a3300,000 for LuaLua made by former manager, Ruud Gullit, had been rejected, but the much increased bid offered financial security and assistance towards a new ground and was one that Colchester felt they could not turn down."]}, {"page": "Liam Chilvers", "response": ["On 24 January 2003, he joined Colchester United on loan until the end of the season, after impressing manager Steve Whitton on a trial. He only made six appearances. At the end of the campaign Arsenal and Northampton Town agreed a transfer that would see Chilvers sign a three-year deal at Northampton; however Chilvers backed out on the deal in the final stages of negotiations."]}, {"page": "Graham Barrett", "response": ["During the 2001\u201302 season, Barrett again went out on loan, this time to Crewe Alexandra, where he made three appearances in his month-long loan stint. He then returned to Arsenal before Wenger agreed to allow him to join Colchester United on loan in December 2001. Barrett quickly became a fan favorite at the club, in scoring a brace during a 3\u20132 win against Northampton Town on Boxing Day 2001. These were his first goals in professional football in only his third game with the U's. Barrett then netted a further two goals in 20 games for Colchester, but an injury suffered during a 0\u20130 draw with Wycombe Wanderers curtailed the rest of his season. As a mark of respect, United fans dressed in green in their final home game of the season, in a nod to Barrett's Irish roots. Colchester manager Steve Whitton thus sought to have Barrett back at Layer Road for the following season. With this being said he opted to go to Brighton & Hove Albion on a season-long loan deal. Prior to joining Brighton he made his full international debut for Ireland in August 2002. This came after having made 24 appearances for the under-21s and representing Ireland at every age group since turning 15. He also scored in a pre-season friendly for Arsenal against Stevenage. With Brighton, Barrett managed to attain 20 league starts, making a further ten appearances as a substitute, but again suffered a series of niggling injuries that held back his progress. At Brighton he also scored once against Sheffield United."]}, {"page": "Peter Beadle", "response": ["In September 2002, Beadle was told he could leave the club on loan. Colchester United manager Steve Whitton confirmed he was interested in signing the striker, but no deal was made. City reached Football League Trophy for a second time in three years at the end of the season. They tasted victory at the Millennium Stadium, beating Carlisle United 2\u20130 with goals from Peacock and Rosenior; Beadle was an unused substitute. He posted 32 appearances in 2002\u201303, scoring four goals. Beadle was released by the club in July 2003, with manager Danny Wilson looking to cut his wage bill in order to make new signings. He then went on trial at Cheltenham Town, but was not offered a contract."]}, {"page": "Justin Richards (footballer)", "response": ["Richards began his career at West Bromwich Albion, joining as an apprentice in July 1997 and turning professional in 1999. He made his Albion debut as a substitute against Ipswich Town in March 1999, and made one further substitute appearance the following season before moving on to Ian Holloway's Bristol Rovers for \u00a375,000 in January 2001. A week after signing him Holloway left the club. Richards joined Colchester United on loan on 22 October 2002. He spent six weeks at Layer Road, making three substitute appearances for Steve Whitton's \"U's\". In three seasons with the \"Pirates\" he started just three games and could do little to prevent the club's relegation from the second to third tier in 2000\u201301. At the end of 2002 he joined non-league Stevenage Borough on loan, scoring six goals in thirteen games, including a hat-trick against Farnborough Town."]}]}}
