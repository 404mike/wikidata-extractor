He is best known for his work in Montreal, Quebec, most notably the Bank of Montreal Head Office and St. Anne's Market, that afterwards housed the Parliament Buildings at Montreal.\nWells was born at Norwich, where he trained as a carpenter. He worked on the facade of St Mary Moorfields in London, after which he became an architect, displaying his works at the Royal Academy in 1823 and 1828. Exploiting the rapid growth and population boom, he came to Montreal in about 1830. His first commission was to erect the new prison, and afterwards he constructed the Ste. Ann's Market (1832), that stood until the Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal. In 1834, he was commissioned by John Redpath and Peter McGill to design and build a new home for St. Paul's Presbyterian Church. He completed several religious buildings for all denominations, including Chalmers-Wesley United Church, and his personal popularity won him private commissions for some of Montreal's leading figures within the Golden Square Mile - such as the Notman House (1845) and Prince of Wales Terrace, completed in 1860 for Sir George Simpson. His biography in The Canadian Encyclopedia, states that \"due to the disappearance of a majority of his works, he has been overlooked as the arbiter of architectural taste in early Victorian Montreal\". He died at Montreal April 26, 1864, and was survived by at least one son (G.H. Wells) and one daughter (Mrs Deborah Wadsworth).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Quebec architects", "response": ["* John Wells"]}, {"page": "John Wells", "response": ["John Wells may refer to:", "*John Wells (artist) (1907\u20132000), Cornish painter", "*John Wells (filmmaker) (born 1956), theater and television producer and writer", "*John Wells (poet), winner of Eric Gregory Award", "*John Wells (satirist) (1936\u20131998), British satirist", "*John Wells or John Wels, screen name of Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 in A Fistful of Dollars", "*John Wells (sportscaster) (born 1946), Canadian sportscaster", "*John Wells, fictional character in the self-titled spy fiction series by Alex Berenson", "*John Wells (politician, born 1761) (1761\u20131848), British MP for Maidstone, 1820\u20131830", "*Sir John Wells (John Julius Wells; 1925\u20132017), British Conservative MP for Maidstone, 1959\u20131987", "*John Wells (Nova Scotia politician) (1772\u2013?), merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia", "*John Wells (New York politician) (1817\u20131877), member of the House of Representatives, 1851\u20131853", "*John Wells (Mormon) (1864\u20131941), general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints", "*John Wells (priest), Archdeacon of Ludlow", "*John Wells (minister), see Morning Exercises", "*John Wells (bishop), Bishop of Llandaff", "*John Wells (baseball) (1922\u20131993), pitcher in Major League Baseball", "*John Wells (cricketer) (1760\u20131835), English cricketer", "*John Wells (jockey) (1833\u20131873), British champion jockey", "*John Wells (rower) (1859\u20131929), represented the United States at the 1904 Summer Olympics", "*John Wells (rugby union) (born 1963), English rugby union footballer and coach", "*John Wells (rugby league) from Stanley Rangers", "*John Wells (soccer) from Colorado Springs Blizzard", "*John Wells (sports administrator) from New Zealand Halberg Awards", "*John Wells (outfielder) in 1978 College World Series", "*Jack Wells (footballer) (John Wells, 1883\u20131966), Australian rules footballer", "*John Wells (architect) (1789\u20131864), architect whose works include the Bank of Montreal Head Office, Montreal", "*John Wells-Thorpe (born 1928), English architect", "*John Wells (Massachusetts judge) (died 1875), member of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court", "*John Wells (Royal Navy officer) (1763\u20131841), admiral who fought at the Battle of Camperdown"]}, {"page": "Tartu College", "response": ["Tartu College was built in 1970, two years after its sister building, the David A.
