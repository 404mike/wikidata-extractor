He quickly established himself as the first choice goalkeeper, however he lost his place by October 1920. He was a member of the sides that won the Staffordshire Senior Cup and shared the North Staffordshire Infirmary Cup in 1920. He proved himself superior to Jonathan Hammond and played 32 Second Division games in the 1919\u201320 season. However, he only featured ten times in the league in the 1920\u201321 campaign, as new signing Walter Smith was preferred. Bourne played 13 matches in the 1921\u201322 season, as he battled with Smith, Teddy Peers and Ernest Blackham for a first team place. Peers won the battle, and Bourne was released from The Old Recreation Ground at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ernest Blackham"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["| Summer 1923 || GK ||  || Ernest Blackham ||  || Released || "]}, {"page": "Blackham (surname)", "response": ["* Ernest Blackham (1898\u20131966), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 1966", "response": ["* Ernest Blackham, English footballer (b. 1898)"]}]}}
