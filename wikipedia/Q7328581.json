He was a part of the \"art turning\" movement that saw turned objects move into galleries where they are presented as works of art.  Although he has created large and valuable works of exotic woods, in his books he has also championed simple utilitarian works created for daily use. He finishes much of this work simply, using vegetable oil and beeswax, and has written admiringly of the patina of well used wooden items. \"An indescribable surface that begs for a caress of the hand--that's what I think wood should provide.\"He was born at Zeal Monachorum in Devon in the UK, lived in Sydney, Australia from 1947 to 1950, and returned to Devon where he was raised. He emigrated to Australia in 1982.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Woodturning", "response": ["* Richard Raffan"]}, {"page": "Taunton Press", "response": ["Taunton Press also publishes books on topics covered in their magazines: woodworking, home building, home design, cooking, gardening and crafts.
