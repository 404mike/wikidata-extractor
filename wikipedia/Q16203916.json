It was the final episode of the final series of Agatha Christie's Poirot, and the first of the final series to be filmed. Hugh Fraser again returned to the role of Hastings, following a ten-year absence; stars such as Alice Orr-Ewing (Judith Hastings), Helen Baxendale (Elizabeth Cole), Anne Reid (Daisy Luttrell), Matthew McNulty (Major Allerton), Shaun Dingwall (Dr Franklin), Aidan McArdle (Stephen Norton) and Philip Glenister (Sir William Boyd-Carrington) were among the other cast. The programme was aired in Britain on 13 November 2013, and later on Acorn TV on 25 August 2014. The adaptation mentions only the Litchfield, Sharples, and Etherington murders. Margaret Litchfield is hanged during the opening credits, whereas in the novel she dies in an asylum. The killer is not labelled 'X' as in the novel, the purpose of the label being achieved in other ways. Otherwise, the adaptation remains extremely faithful to the novel. The rest of the ITV Poirot series are set in the 1930s, regardless of when the novels were written, or the contemporary features in each of the novels; this last story sets the year as 1949."]}, {"page": "Orr (surname)", "response": ["* Alice Orr-Ewing (born 1989), British actress"]}, {"page": "Heathfield School, Ascot", "response": ["*Alice Orr-Ewing, actress"]}, {"page": "A Fantastic Fear of Everything", "response": ["* Alice Orr-Ewing as Lavinia"]}, {"page": "The Scapegoat (2012 film)", "response": ["* Alice Orr-Ewing as Frances, Spence's wife"]}, {"page": "A Very English Scandal (TV series)", "response": ["* Alice Orr-Ewing as Caroline Allpass"]}, {"page": "Orr-Ewing", "response": ["*Alice Orr-Ewing (born 1989), British actress"]}, {"page": "Orr-Ewing, Alice", "response": ["#redirectAlice Orr-Ewing"]}]}}
