This would give the Scottish Government the power to make decisions on policies relating to issues such as welfare benefits, income tax and corporation tax, effectively making it a fully self-governing region of the United Kingdom. The Commission, chaired by Lamont and including politicians, academics and trade union members, met for the first time in October 2012. It published an interim report in April 2013, recommending that Scotland have autonomy over income tax, but leaving decisions on corporation tax and welfare to the UK Parliament. But party members opposed it, warning that the plans could threaten the Barnett formula, the financial mechanism under which Scotland receives an annual average of \u00a31,600 per head more in UK Government spending than does the rest of the UK. Ian Davidson, chair of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee said the proposals could affect spending in poorer areas. Macintosh subsequently warned that devolving responsibility for income tax would reduce the Scottish tax base and result in independence by default, a claim that Guy Lodge and Alan Trench of the Institute for Public Policy Research called \"highly disingenuous\" because income tax makes up only 23% of the taxes collected by the UK Government.", "Miliband paid tribute to Lamont shortly after she announced that she intended to relinquish the leadership role, saying she had \"led the Scottish Labour Party with determination\". McLeish and McConnell both indicated that Lamont's sudden departure following weeks of speculation could have implications for Miliband's leadership. McLeish said that Miliband's chance of becoming Prime Minister could be affected if Labour returned fewer Scottish MPs in 2015, something he called a problem of \"historic, epic proportions\", while McConnell said that he was \"very, very angry\" and suggested Miliband had questions to answer about the circumstances surrounding the resignation. Salmond echoed the views of his predecessor, arguing that Miliband \"should be answering questions about why Labour in Scotland is run as an extension of his Westminster office, and why he has effectively forced the resignation of a Labour leader in Scotland.\" Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, rejected Lamont's claims about UK Labour's treatment of its Scottish counterpart. Ian Davidson claimed that supporters of Murphy, who subsequently announced his intention to stand in the leadership contest to succeed Lamont, had conducted a whispering campaign against her. He further suggested that those on the right of the party had resented her election as leader and ignored her, treating her as a \"wee lassie\"."]}, {"page": "Glasgow South West (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Ian Davidson"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Ian Davidson"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: D", "response": ["*Ian Davidson (1992\u20132015)"]}, {"page": "1994 Labour Party leadership election", "response": ["| Ian Davidson || Prescott || Prescott"]}, {"page": "Tony's Cronies", "response": ["The accusations of cronyism also extended to a number of public appointments Blair made.
