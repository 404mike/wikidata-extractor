He was born in Halifax, Yorkshire.\nIn 2017, Sladdin was convicted of the sexual grooming of a fourteen year old girl and sentenced to one year in prison.The most important spinner within the Derbyshire lineup in the early part of the 1990s, he debuted in a draw against Yorkshire in July 1991, as Derbyshire finished in third position in the season's table. A common fixture until the middle of the 1994 season, his career was quickly over, as he hit zero wickets for 190 runs, the single worst bowling figures in the history of Derbyshire County Cricket Club.\nPrior to the end of his career, he played briefly in the 1997 season, for Somerset, though his career finished there. He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler. He hit five wickets in an inning twice in his career, including once in his sole first-class game for Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matthew Taylor (cricketer, born 1973)", "response": ["Taylor represented Derbyshire in four matches during the 1994 season, and though it looked like he would benefit from the release of Richard Sladdin during 1994, Taylor found himself relegated to the second team, where he would find team-mates Andy Cottam and Tom Harrison ahead of him in the batting lineup."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Richard Sladdin (1997) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "Sladdin, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Sladdin"]}]}}
