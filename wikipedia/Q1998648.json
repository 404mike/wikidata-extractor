These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos: for series III (the first-ever release), \"Bodyswap\" and \"Timeslides\" were swapped round, so that the latter could receive top billing on the second VHS volume; for the second VHS volume of series I, \"Confidence and Paranoia\" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being \"Waiting for God\" which shared its name with the title of another comedy series (set in a retirement home); and for series V, \"Back to Reality\" and \"Quarantine\" were given top billing on their respective video release, which completely re-organised the order of episodes from that in which they were originally broadcast. Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context. All eight series were made available on VHS, and three episodes of series VII were also released as special \"Xtended\" [sic] versions with extra scenes (including an original, unbroadcast ending for the episode \"Tikka To Ride\") and no laugh track; the remastered versions of series I\u2013III were also released individually and in a complete box-set.
