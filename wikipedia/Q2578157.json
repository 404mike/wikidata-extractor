They were undertaken by William Burke and William Hare, who sold the corpses to Robert Knox for dissection at his anatomy lectures.\nEdinburgh was a leading European centre of anatomical study in the early 19th century, in a time when the demand for cadavers led to a shortfall in legal supply. Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison, suicide victims, or from foundlings and orphans. The shortage of corpses led to an increase in body snatching by what were known as \"resurrection men\". Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed\u2014such as the use of mortsafes\u2014exacerbated the shortage. When a lodger in Hare's house died, Hare turned to his friend Burke for advice and they decided to sell the body to Knox. They received what was, for them, the generous sum of \u00a37 10s. A little over two months later, when Hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in the house, he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox. The men continued their murder spree, probably with the knowledge of their wives. Burke and Hare's actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim, Margaret Docherty, and contacted the police.\nA forensic examination of Docherty's body indicated she had probably been suffocated, but this could not be proven. Although the police suspected Burke and Hare of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven\u2014a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards; his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as at 2021, it remains.\nThe murders raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act 1832. The events have made appearances in literature, and been portrayed on screen, either in heavily fictionalised accounts, or as the inspiration for fictional works.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The New Exhibit", "response": ["Martin Senescu works at a wax museum.

The anatomist  John Barclay bought the building in 1800 and began to teach anatomy. The house also contained a dissection room. His classes proved extremely popular and by the time he retired in 1825 he was teaching some 300 students per year. After Charles Bell left Edinburgh in 1808 and Alexander Monro secundus  retired from anatomy teaching at the university the same year, Barclay became the most popular anatomy teacher in Edinburgh. His popularity was further enhanced by the unpopularity of Alexander Monro tertius, who had succeeded his father in  the university chair.  Barclay had amassed a large collection of comparative anatomy specimens used for teaching and this collection was bought by the RCSEd to form the Barclay collection in their museum. Barclay was  succeeded in his anatomy school by Robert Knox. Knox catalogued the Barclay collection and the Charles Bell collection as curator of the Surgeons' Hall museum. The greatly enlarged collection was housed from 1832 in the new Surgeons' Hall which had been built to accommodate it. Knox was also a gifted anatomy teacher in marked contrast to Alexander Monro tertius at the university. Knox's classes were made more attractive by offering anatomical dissection under his supervision. As the demand for bodies for dissection exceeded supply, the serial killers William Burke and William Hare sold the bodies of their victims to Knox's anatomy school. After Burke was hanged for these crimes Knox was exonerated by a committee of 'distinguished citizens' and continued to teach at 10 Surgeons' Square until 1833. At the height of his popularity as a teacher in 1826, Knox attracted over 500 students to his anatomy classes, the largest number ever seen in the British Isles. William Fergusson assisted Knox with anatomy teaching until 1840 when he was appointed professor of surgery at King's College London and later became sergeant-surgeon to Queen Victoria."]}]}}
