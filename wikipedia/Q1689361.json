David is attracted to Beshraavi's girlfriend Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), who tells him that Beshraavi had Ragheeb killed and will do the same to him once he decodes the message. Their conversation is interrupted by Beshraavi. David keeps hidden until Sloane brings it to Beshraavi's attention that David and the cipher are missing. Overhearing the conversation, David wraps the cipher in a candy in his pocket, among others, a red one with the number \"9\". As Beshraavi's men search for David, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley (Jimmy Gardner), that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge.  Forced to show himself, David seemingly abducts Yasmin. They flee from one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha (Larry Taylor). In the course of the chase, Mustapha and David struggle at the zoological gardens, when another man intervenes and kills Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster (Duncan Lamont) with CID. When a guard approaches, Webster kills him before revealing that he is working with Yasmin. Webster knocks David unconscious."]}, {"page": "Here Come the Double Deckers", "response": ["* David Hutcheson, Jimmy Gardner, Robin Askwith in episode 10."]}, {"page": "The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb", "response": ["*Jimmy Gardner: Fred's mate"]}, {"page": "Gardner (surname)", "response": ["* Jimmy Gardner (disambiguation)", "** Jimmy Gardner (ice hockey) (1881\u20131940), Canadian professional ice hockey forward", "** Jimmy Gardner (boxer) (1885\u20131964), Irish-American boxer", "** Jimmy Gardner (actor) (1924\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "Eddie Yeats", "response": ["After his brief stay with the Ogdens, Eddie lived at Monkey Gibbons's house. Stan and Hilda began to regard Eddie as the son they never had. In 1977, he started a short-lived curtain-making business with Hilda but this ended when Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) would not let Hilda use his factory. Eddie regularly tried to sell products to his neighbours, insisting nothing was stolen or faulty, but there was always a problem of some sort. He sold Rovers Return landlady Annie Walker (Doris Speed) a carpet with her initials on it. The initials were the same because the carpet came from the Alhambra Weatherfield Bingo Hall. His promise to get a colour television for the Ogdens was similarly unsuccessful as he only managed to get them a colour tinted screen. In 1978, Eddie was suspected by the police of stealing Stan's handcart and filling it with lead stolen from Farraday Street, even though Eddie's friend, Tiny Hargreaves (Jimmy Gardner), was the real culprit. The cart was impounded by the police when Hilda took it back and Eddie and Stan claimed it was stolen. But the police found Eddie's fingerprints on the cart and Stan discredited Eddie's alibi by claiming not to know him. Eddie forgave Stan when he told the police the truth, but to clear themselves, they had to admit who the real culprit was and Eddie hated the thought of shopping his friends to the police."]}, {"page": "1924 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Jimmy Gardner, actor (died 2010)"]}, {"page": "Take Me High", "response": ["* Jimmy Gardner as Hulbert"]}, {"page": "The Committee (film)", "response": ["* Jimmy Gardner as Boss"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* Jimmy Gardner"]}, {"page": "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1967 TV serial)", "response": ["* Jimmy Gardner \u2014 Mr. Beaver"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2004", "response": ["| Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban || Warner Bros.
