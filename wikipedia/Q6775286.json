This would make Holland the first American in history to become a full-time entrant in the UK's most popular racing series. New to almost every circuit on the calendar Holland stated moderate goals of finishing in the points by the second half of the season. With the newly built S3 only completed a few days prior to the first round at Brands Hatch, Holland struggled to break into the top 20, with a best finish of 20th in the third race. The next round at Donington would prove to be a major set back for Holland who was collected by James Cole in the Toyota Avensis, as Cole swerved to avoid a spinning Rob Austin  This incident left the Audi badly damaged and unable to be repaired in time for the following round at Thruxton. Coming back for the race at Oulton Park, Holland turned qualifying issues into a strong final race in monsoon-like conditions, where the American was able to move from the back row at the start into the top 12 by mid race. Contact from Dan Welch in the Proton cut down a rear tire on the Audi, ending Holland's run. Holland was able to get into the points at Snetterton where he battled former champions Fabrizio Giovanardi and Andrew Jordan for the finial points-paying position. Holland was able to follow that result up with finishes in the top 20 at Knockhill, and scored further points at Rockingham before another incident with James Cole and Martin Depper at Silverstone ended Holland's season prematurely in 27th place overall."]}]}}
