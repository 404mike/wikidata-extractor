Spending his entire career at the Brasenose College, Oxford, he wrote the most commonly cited edition of Seneca the Younger's Letters.The central academic achievement of Reynolds's career was the publication in 1965 of The Medieval Tradition of Seneca's Letters, in which he reconstructed how the text was transmitted through the Middle Ages and revealed that most of the younger manuscripts were of little use for the establishment of the text. He also wrote critical editions of Seneca's Dialogues, the works of the historian Sallust, and Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum. In 1968, Reynolds and his Oxford colleague Nigel Guy Wilson co-authored Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature, a well-received introduction to textual criticism.\nWriting about the set of critical editions authored by Reynolds, the Latinist Michael Reeve stated that Reynolds's scholarship had the ability to \"to cut through dozens of manuscripts to the serviceable core\". At the time of its publication, his work on Seneca was considered by some commentators to be difficult to surpass.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in December 1999", "response": ["*Leighton Durham Reynolds, 69, British academic."]}]}}
