During this spell, Millwall played 55 different teams, kept 35 clean sheets, scored 112 goals and conceded 33. This was thanks largely to managers Billy Gray, who laid the foundations, and Benny Fenton, a former player who continued to build on Gray's side. All the players, which included winger Barry Rowan, goalkeeper Alex Stepney and strikers Hugh Curran and Len Julians, were presented with a commemorative gold cigarette lighter by the Football Association. The record was eventually broken by Liverpool, who were unbeaten for 63 games at home between 1978 and 1981.", "* Hugh Curran"]}, {"page": "Derek Dougan", "response": ["Wolves finished fourth in the 1970\u201371 season, with Dougan claiming 12 goals from 25 league games as he was rotated throughout the campaign with Hugh Curran and Bobby Gould. Wolves also won the inaugural Texaco Cup after beating Heart of Midlothian 3\u20132 on aggregate in the final. The following season, he formed an understanding with John Richards that teammate Derek Parkin described as the \"best partnership in Europe\", which helped to boost Dougan's scoring tally and make Wolves one of the top teams in the country during the early 1970s. They qualified for the UEFA Cup, and Dougan scored a hat-trick in a first round 7\u20131 aggregate victory over Portuguese side Acad\u00e9mica. Wolves then progressed past Dutch side Den Haag by the same score, beat East German side Carl Zeiss Jena 4\u20130 on aggregate, and overcome Italian giants Juventus 3\u20132 on aggregate before knocking out Ferencv\u00e1ro of Hungary 4\u20133 on aggregate to reach the final. There they lost 3\u20132 on aggregate to fellow English side Tottenham Hotspur, \"Spurs\" goalkeeper Pat Jennings putting in a number of saves at White Hart Lane to deny Dougan and Richards from levelling the tie after the first leg at Molineux ended in a 2\u20131 defeat. Wolves finished ninth in the league in the 1971\u201372 season, but managed to beat Leeds United on the final day of the season to prevent them from reaching league champions Derby County's point tally, Dougan scoring his 24th goal of the season to secure a 2\u20131 win at Molineux."]}]}}
