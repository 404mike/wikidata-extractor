This influence can be traced right through to Alexander Scott and the various members of the Castalian Band in the Scottish court of James VI (1567\u20131603) which included Alexander Montgomerie and, once again, the king himself. The king composed a treatise, the Reulis and Cautelis (1584), which proposed a formalisation of Scottish prosody and consciously strove to identify what was distinctive in the Scots tradition. Written in the Language of the Scottis Nation, p.64 (online source) The removal of the Court to London under James after 1603 is usually regarded as marking the eclipse of the distinctively Scottish tradition of poetry initiated by the Makars, but figures such as William Drummond might loosely be seen as forming a continuation into the seventeenth century."]}, {"page": "List of Aberdonians", "response": ["*Alexander Scott (1920\u20131989), poet in Braid Scots and English"]}, {"page": "1920 in poetry", "response": ["* November 28 \u2013 Alexander Scott (died 1989), Scottish poet and literary scholar"]}, {"page": "Alexander Scott (16th-century poet)", "response": ["Alexander Scott (Scots: Sanderris Scott: 1520?1582/1583) was a Scottish Court poet.Daiches, D.
