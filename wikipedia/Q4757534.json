He was born at Southampton, Hampshire.\nJones was a tail-end right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who played principally second eleven cricket for Somerset between 1984 and 1986. In 1985 he played three first-class matches, taking three wickets, though never more than one per innings, and scoring three runs in four visits to the wicket to bat, again never managing more than one run per innings. In his single List A match against the 1985 Zimbabweans, he broke the mould somewhat by scoring three runs, though he reverted to type by taking only one wicket when he bowled.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Jones", "response": ["Andrew Jones may refer to:", "*Andrew Jones (Australian politician) (1944\u20132015), Australian politician", "*Andrew Jones (British politician) (born 1963), British politician", "*Andrew Jones (fl. 1386), MP for Cricklade", "*Andrew Jones (Alabama politician), Republican member of the Alabama Senate", "*Andrew Jones (cricket administrator) (born 1972), current CEO of Cricket NSW", "*Andrew Jones (Australian cricketer) (born 1964), Australian cricketer", "*Andrew Jones (New Zealand cricketer) (Andrew Howard Jones, born 1959), New Zealand test cricketer, played for Central Districts Stags, Otago Volts and Wellington Firebirds", "*Andrew Jones (Welsh cricketer) (Andrew James Jones, born 1972), former Welsh cricketer, played for Wales Minor Counties", "*Andrew Jones (Staffordshire cricketer) (Andrew James Jones, born 1977), former English cricketer, played for Staffordshire", "*Andrew Jones (Somerset cricketer) (Andrew Paul Jones, born 1964), former English cricketer, played for Somerset", "*Andrew Jones (basketball) (born 1997), American basketball player", "*Andrew Jones (Canadian football) (born 1982), Canadian football player", "*Andrew Jones (racing driver) (born 1980), Australian racing driver", "*Andrew Jones (artist), American visual artist", "*Andrew Jones (Medal of Honor) (1835\u2013?), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*Andrew Jones (filmmaker) (born 1983), British screenwriter and director", "*Andrew Jones (priest) (born 1961), Church in Wales priest"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Andrew Jones (1985) 3 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Andrew Paul Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Jones (Somerset cricketer) "]}]}}
