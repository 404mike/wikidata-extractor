He was only convicted for three murders, although two further cases were left to lie on file and police later found proof that he had killed one of these victims.\nOfficially diagnosed as a psychopath, Mackay has been repeatedly denied parole since 1995 on the basis that he is considered too dangerous for release, although in recent years has been imprisoned in open prison conditions with day release provisions. In 2019, police launched fresh inquiries into his suspected murders, but were unable to find sufficient evidence.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cheyne Walk", "response": ["* No 19 was site of the horrific 1973 killing of elderly widow Isabella Griffith, by the serial killer Patrick Mackay."]}, {"page": "List of serial killers by country", "response": ["*Patrick Mackay: charged with the murders of five individuals in London and Kent, convicted of three; confessed to killing eleven people from 1974 to 1975."]}, {"page": "Colin Pitchfork", "response": ["*Patrick Mackay \u2013 a British murderer believed to have murdered up to 13 people who has been considered for release since 1995"]}, {"page": "Patrick (given name)", "response": ["*Patrick Mackay (born 1952), British serial killer "]}, {"page": "Dartford", "response": ["* Patrick Mackay (born 1952), serial killer"]}, {"page": "List of serial killers by number of victims", "response": ["| Patrick Mackay", "| Burglar suspect of 12 violent murders during robberies, charged with five, convicted of three.
