The scheme was enthusiastically taken up by John Stuart Mill, ensuring international interest.  The 1865 edition of the book included the transfer of preferences from dropped candidates and the STV method was essentially complete, Although Hare pictured the entire British Isles as one single district.  Mill proposed it to the House of Commons in 1867, but the British parliament rejected it.  The name evolved from \"Mr.Hare's scheme\" to \"proportional representation\", then \"proportional representation with the single transferable vote\", and finally, by the end of the 19th century, to \"the single transferable vote\".", "*F.D.

Hare's view was that STV should be a means of \"making the exercise of the suffrage a step in the elevation of the individual character, whether it be found in the majority or the minority.\" In Hare's original system, he further proposed that electors should have the opportunity of discovering which candidate their vote had ultimately counted for, to improve their personal connection with voting. At the time of Hare's original proposal, the UK did not use the secret ballot, so not only could the voter determine the ultimate role of their vote in the election, the elected MPs would have been able to determine who had voted for them. As Hare envisaged that the whole House of Commons be elected \"at large\" this would have replaced geographical constituencies with what Hare called \"constituencies of interest\" \u2013 those people who had actually voted for each MP. In modern elections, held by secret ballot, a voter can discover how their vote was distributed by viewing detailed election results. This is particularly easy to do using Meek's method, where only the final weightings of each candidate need to be published. The elected member is, however, unable to verify whom their supporters were.", "Advocacy of STV spread throughout the British Empire, leading it to be sometimes known as British Proportional Representation.

The Country Party split the anti-Labor vote in conservative country areas, allowing Labor candidates to win on a minority vote. The conservative federal government of Billy Hughes introduced preferential voting as a means of allowing competition between the two conservative parties without putting seats at risk.
