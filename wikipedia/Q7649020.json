Later swimsuit designs like the tankini and trikini further cemented this derivation. Over time the \"\u2013kini family\" (as dubbed by author William SafireWilliam Safire, No Uncertain Terms, page 291, Simon & Schuster, 2003, ), including the \"\u2013ini sisters\" (as dubbed by designer Anne ColeTrish Donnally, \"\"Inis\" Are In\", San Francisco Chronicle, May 18, 1999), expanded into a variety of swimwear including the monokini (also known as a numokini or unikini), seekini, tankini, camikini,  (also hipkini), minikini, face-kini, burkini, and microkini.

It is broadcast on Channel 4 and currently presented by Anne Robinson, assisted by Rachel Riley, with resident lexicographer Susie Dent. It was the first programme to be aired on Channel 4, and 83 series have been broadcast since its debut on 2 November 1982. With over 7,000 episodes, Countdown is one of the longest-running game shows in the world, along with the original French version, Des chiffres et des lettres (Numbers & Letters), which has been running on French television continuously since 1965. Countdown was initially recorded at The Leeds Studios for 27 years, before moving to Manchester-based Granada Studios in 2009. Following the development of MediaCityUK, Countdown moved again in 2013 to the new purpose-built studios at Dock10, Greater Manchester.", "In the early years, the show had multiple assistant presenters, including Carol Vorderman, who was hired for the first series to check calculations in the numbers round. Vorderman's role expanded to include placing the number and letter tiles and being a co-host of the show. She left in 2008, at the same time as O'Connor, and was replaced by Rachel Riley. Susie Dent has been the permanent lexicographer since 2004, and appears in \"Dictionary Corner\" alongside a guest.", "!scope=row|Susie Dent", "Over time, the additional hostesses on the programme were dropped by production staff, who retained Vorderman and assigned her primarily to handle the selection of letter and number tiles, as well as verifying contestant calculations. Thus her role was expanded to that of a co-presenter alongside Whiteley.Independent.co.uk  on viewer dissatisfaction with Vorderman's expanded role\u2014Retrieved 20 June 2006. The programme frequently rotated between various lexicographers, including Richard Samson and Alison Heard, for each series, until in 2004 the role was permanently given to Susie Dent, after her debut on Countdown in 1992.The Countdown Page on lexicographers.", "Since the change to 45-minute episodes, the game has been split into three sections, separated by advertising breaks. The first section contains two letters rounds and a numbers round, the second has two letters rounds and a numbers round followed by the anecdote from the Dictionary Corner guest and then a further two letters rounds and a numbers round, while the last section has two letters rounds, Susie Dent's \"Origins of Words\" item, two further letters rounds, a numbers round and a final \"Conundrum\" puzzle. With the exception of the Conundrum, the contestants swap control after every round so that each of them has control for five letters rounds and two numbers rounds.", "In September 2007, an \"Origin of Words\" feature was added to the show, in which Susie Dent explains the origin of a word or phrase she has been researching. This feature follows the eighth letters round, partway through the third section of each episode. The feature was omitted during the time that Dent was absent for maternity leave, and was reinstated upon her return.", "When the 15-round format was first introduced in September 2001, the composition of the rounds was different from that used by the programme today. The three sections each had five rounds, four letters rounds and one numbers round in each of the first two sections, with three letters rounds, one numbers round and the conundrum in the third section. This meant that there was a slight imbalance, whereby one contestant made the letters sections for six rounds, but had the choice of the numbers selection just once, whereas the other contestant chose letters five times and numbers twice. The Dictionary Corner guest's spot was immediately before the first advertising break, and Susie Dent's Origin of Words spot preceded the second numbers game shortly before the second break. The change to the present format was made on 25 March 2013, three weeks into the second section of Series 68, to comply with Channel 4's decision to increase the amount of adverts and alter the times when they occur during the programme, therefore reducing Countdown's actual show length from 36 to 35 minutes.", "Richard Whiteley and Carol Vorderman competed in another special episode on Christmas Day 1997. For this game, the presenter's chair was taken by William G. Stewart, the host of fellow Channel 4 game show Fifteen to One. Susie Dent took over Vorderman's duties, and Mark Nyman occupied Dictionary Corner, accompanied by Magnus Magnusson. The game was close-fought, and decided only by the crucial Countdown conundrum mistletoe which Vorderman solved in two seconds, after Whiteley had inadvertently buzzed after one second, because when he regularly hosted the show, he hit the button to reveal the conundrum and kept his old habit up.The Countdown Page recap of Whiteley vs. Vorderman Christmas special\u2014Retrieved 25 June 2006."]}, {"page": "John Sergeant (journalist)", "response": ["Sergeant has appeared on television programmes such as Have I Got News for You.

Because the nerves involved in transmitting \"light\" touch and itch differ from those nerves that transmit \"heavy\" touch, pressure and vibration, it is possible that the difference in sensations produced by the two types of tickle is due to the relative proportion of itch sensation versus touch sensation.
