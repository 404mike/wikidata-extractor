He claims that the references to these artists are not direct quotations, but alterations and combinations of several works by different artists,Glenn Brown: \"People may think that a single painting stimulates me to make a 'copy', but I never make a direct quotation. I start with a vague idea of the kind of painting I want to make, and I do small sketches of it. These will more or less determine the size of the painting, the colour, the type of background, etc, but at that point I still don\u2019t know what the subject matter will be, or which artist will inspire the work. Then I spend some time looking through books and catalogues to find a painting that fits my idea as closely as possible. I look at hundreds of images to find a reproduction I can transform by stretching, pulling or turning it upside down so it fits into my practice.\u201d Quoted in   although the artists whose work is appropriated do not always agree.Richard Alleyne, How inspiration can be mistaken for imitation The Telegraph, 29 Nov 2000 (accessed 7 January 2014). As art critic Michael Bracewell states, Brown is \"less concerned with the art-historical status of those works he appropriates than with their ability to serve his purpose \u2013 namely his epic exploration of paint and painting.\" In most cases, the artist uses reproductions printed in exhibition catalogues, found on the internet or ordered through print-on-demand companies. By scanning and changing the image with programmes like Photoshop, Brown playfully alters the image to his specific needs. He distorts, stretches, pulls, turns the image upside down and changes the colour, usually based on other found images, as well as the background setting. Describing his working practice in an interview, Brown stated: \"I\u2018m rather like a Dr Frankenstein, constructing paintings out of the residue or dead parts of other artist\u2018s work. I hope to create a sense of strangeness by bringing together examples of the way the best historic and modern-day artists have depicted their personal sense of the world. I see their worlds from multiple or schizophrenic perspectives, through all their eyes. Their sources of inspiration suggest things I would never normally see \u2013 rocks floating in far-off galaxies, for example, or a bowl of flowers in an 18th-century room, or a child in a fancy-dress costume. It\u2018s those fictions that I take as subject matter. The scenes may have been relatively normal to Rembrandt or Fragonard but because of the passage of time and the difference in culture, to me they are fantastical.\"Quoted in ", "*Glenn Brown in conversation with Michael Bracewell, held 5 May."]}, {"page": "Bracewell", "response": ["* Michael Bracewell (born 1958), British writer and novelist"]}, {"page": "Dexter Dalwood", "response": ["Michael Bracewell & Terry R Myers, Dexter Dalwood   jrpringier, 2010 "]}, {"page": "Ged Quinn", "response": ["*Ged Quinn, text by Michael Bracewell and Dr Brian Dillon (2013), New Art Gallery Walsall, West Midlands, UK", "*My Great Unhappiness Gives Me a Right to Your Benevolence, text by Michael Bracewell (2007), Wilkinson Gallery, London, UK"]}, {"page": "Tom Hunter (artist)", "response": ["*Tom Hunter.
