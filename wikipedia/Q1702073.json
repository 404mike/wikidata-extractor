N. Watkins. In justificationism, criticism consists of trying to show that a claim cannot be reduced to the authority or criteria that it appeals to. That is, it regards the justification of a claim as primary, while the claim itself is secondary. By contrast, non-justificational criticism works towards attacking claims themselves."]}, {"page": "John Watkins", "response": ["* John W. N.

One such reply provided by John W. N. Watkins is that even if life were destroyed, life could evolve again, perhaps in a worse way. So the world-exploder would need to destroy the possibility of life, but that is in principle beyond human power.John W. N. Watkins describes himself as \"a sort of negative utilitarian\" . He replies to R. N. Smart that \"even if all life were destroyed, in due course living matter might emerge from the slime once more, and the evolutionary process start up again\u2014this time accompanied, perhaps, by even more pain than would have accompanied the continued existence of the human race. So the pain minimiser would need to destroy the very possibility of life. And I like to think that this is something which is in principle beyond human power\" . To this, J. J. C.
