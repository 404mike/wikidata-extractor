Working with the Mad Professor, he combined dancehall and dub styles of reggae, although he has avoided a more commercial crossover approach.

He emigrated from Guyana to London at the age of 13 and later began his music career as a service technician.

Fraser's Dub Me Crazy series of albums won the support of John Peel, who regularly aired tracks from the albums.
