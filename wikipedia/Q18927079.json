It was subsequently acquired by Baron Hans Thyssen for \u00a3600,000 in the late 1970s. Thyssen hired the Italian designer Lorenzo Mongiardino to redecorate the interior at a cost almost equal to the purchase price of the house. Thyssen subsequently estimated that he had spent \u00a33 million on Daylesford, having renovated houses on the estate and increased the surrounding landholding to 12,000 acres. Thyssen described the expenditure as \"...endless, and the weather was appalling, so we only went in the winter so at least we knew what to expect\". It was sold in 1986 to Sir Anthony Bamford.
