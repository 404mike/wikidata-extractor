On 6 June 1859, Queen Victoria signed Letters Patent to form the separate colony of Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government. Brisbane was selected as the capital city. On 10 December 1859, a proclamation was read by George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland, formally establishing Queensland as a separate colony from New South Wales. On 22 May 1860 the first Queensland election was held and Robert Herbert, Bowen's private secretary, was appointed as the first Premier of Queensland."]}, {"page": "Diamantina National Park", "response": ["Diamantina National Park is a national park in the Channel Country of South West Queensland, Australia,  west of Brisbane.

Instead, Grey drafted what would later become the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, which determined the right to vote based on land-ownership franchise. Since most M\u0101ori land was communally owned, very few M\u0101ori had the right to vote for the institutions of the colonial government. Following the election of the first parliament in 1853, responsible government was instituted in 1856. The direction of \"native affairs\" was kept at the sole discretion of the Governor, meaning control of M\u0101ori affairs and land remained outside of the elected ministry. This quickly became a point of contention between the colonial government and Governor, who retained their own \"Native Secretary\" to advise then on \"native affairs\". In 1861, Governor Grey agreed to consult the ministers in relation to native affairs, but this position only lasted until his recall from office in 1867. Grey's successor as Governor, George Bowen, took direct control of native affairs until his term ended in 1870. From then on, the elected ministry, lead by the Premier, controlled the colonial government's policy on M\u0101ori land."]}, {"page": "Roma, Queensland", "response": ["Roma is a town, locality and the administrative centre in the Maranoa Region, Queensland, Australia.

His proposal, incorporating the Southern Cross, was approved on 23 October 1869. It was initially to be used only on government ships."]}, {"page": "Te Kooti's War", "response": ["News of Te Kooti's presence in Te Kuiti, and the prospect of the two M\u0101ori leaders forming an alliance, alarmed the government. Premier William Fox said the development heightened \"the probability of a combined attack on the settled districts in the neighbourhood of Auckland\" and both Houses of Parliament accepted government motions asking Major-General Sir Trevor Chute, commander of the British forces in New Zealand, to cancel orders for a planned withdrawal of the 18th Regiment, the sole remaining British regiment in New Zealand. Yet Binney has  speculated that history could well have turned had T\u0101whiao decided to join Te Kooti's campaign. In official correspondence between Auckland and London in 1869, Governor George Bowen advocated granting \"a separate principality\" for T\u0101whiao as a means of attaining peace, while the British government similarly urged the colonial government to \"cede the lands conquered by the Queen's troops\" and surrender \"the Queen's sovereignty\" in those areas, while recognising \"absolute dominion\" by the King within his borders. Premier Fox, who was desperately trying to cut military expenditure, strongly opposed proposals for M\u0101ori self-government under the M\u0101ori king, as urged by Bowen and former Chief Justice Sir William Martin, but the formation of a more robust pan-M\u0101ori alliance could have become a tipping point to create a system of separate M\u0101ori rule in their territory."]}, {"page": "T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene", "response": ["T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene died on 4 August 1871, and is buried in Russell.

At the time the M\u0101ori chiefs Te Kooti and Titokowaru had the colonial government and settlers extremely alarmed with a series of military successes. With the support of the Premier Edward Stafford, Grey evaded instructions from the Colonial Office to finalise the return of the regiments, which had commenced in 1865 and 1866. In the end, the British government recalled (removed) Grey from the office of Governor in February 1868. He was replaced by Sir George Bowen and during his term hostilities concluded with the abandoned pursuit of war leader Riwha Titokowaru \u2013 again in Taranaki \u2013 in 1869."]}, {"page": "Governor of Hong Kong", "response": ["| Sir George Bowen\u5bf6\u96f2"]}, {"page": "Ali Pasha of Ioannina", "response": [" According to George Bowen, Ali Pasha was part of the Lab tribe; as this tribe was in disrepute among the other Albanians for their poverty and predatory habits, he thought it proper to call himself after Tepelena, a town of the Tosks; no one dared to dispute this until after his death.George Bowen (1852), Mount Athos, Thessaly and Epirus: A diary of a Journey, Francis & John Rivington, London, p. 192, cited in Hart Laurie Kain (1999)Culture, civilization and demarcation at the northwest borders of Greece, American Ethnologist, 26(1), pp. 196\u2013220, footnote 19.

This exemplified by the establishment of M\u0101ori seats in parliament in 1867, and by Stafford's request for the governor to pardon \"rebel\" M\u0101ori chiefs. The sudden military successes of Te Kooti and Titokowaru caused many to claim that Stafford's attempts at reconciliation had been misjudged. Stafford sought to call an election and gain a fresh mandate, but his move was blocked by Governor George Bowen, who had a strong dislike of Stafford. Stafford's government was defeated in 1869.
