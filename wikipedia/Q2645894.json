The heralds are also entitled to distinctive sceptres, which have been a symbol of their office since the Tudor period. In 1906 new sceptres were made, most likely the initiative of Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty. These take the form of short black batons with gilded ends, each with a representation of the badges of the different offices of the heralds. In 1953 these were replaced by white staves, with gilded metal handles and at its head a blue dove in a golden coronet or a \"martinet\". These blue martinets are derived from the arms of the College. Another of the heralds' insignia of office is the Collar of SS, which they wear over their uniforms. During inclement weather, a large black cape is worn. At state funerals, they would wear a wide sash of black silk sarsenet over their tabards (in ancient times, they would have worn long black hooded cloaks under their tabards)."]}, {"page": "Margaret Gatty", "response": ["Gatty was the mother of Juliana Horatia Ewing, also a writer of children's books, of the musician and author Charles Tindal Gatty, and of Alfred Scott-Gatty who served as Garter Principal King of Arms.

When new lord mayoralties were created in the 1890s it was not clear if they also enjoyed this privilege. When the grant of a lord mayor was made to Liverpool and Manchester in 1893, Sir Albert William Woods, Garter Principal King of Arms, was of the opinion that ...the chief magistrates of those cities on which the dignity was conferred should be able to use the prefix of \"right honourable\" in the same way as London had done from time immemorial.Ten years later his successor as Garter, Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty, decided that this was in error. However, the Lord Mayors of Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol continued to use the prefix. The matter came to a head in 1921, when King George V visited Liverpool, and the Home Office was forced to write to the council to inform that it could not be used without the express permission of the monarch. In the meantime, the prefix had been formally granted to the Lord Provost of Glasgow in 1912. In 1923 the Lord Mayor of Belfast was granted the honour in recognition of the city's new status as capital of Northern Ireland.J V Beckett, City Status in the British Isles, 1830-2002, Aldershot, 2005"]}, {"page": "Lord Mayor of Liverpool", "response": ["For a substantial period of time the Lord Mayor of Liverpool used the prefix of \"The Right Honourable\" as did the Lord Mayor of London.

When Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty succeeded as King of Arms, he expressed the view that his predecessor had made an error.  This changed nothing, however, and the city continued to use the prefix up until a Parliamentary statement in 1927.
