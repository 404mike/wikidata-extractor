Thompson has defined it as \"the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed\".  Valentine M. Moghadam defined it as \"an increasing trend toward multilateralism (in which the United Nations plays a key role), to an emerging 'transnational state apparatus,' and toward the emergence of national and international nongovernmental organizations that act as watchdogs over governments and have increased their activities and influence\". Manfred B. Steger in turn wrote that it \"refers to the intensification and expansion of political interrelations across the globe\". The longer definition by Colin Crouch goes as follows: \"Political globalization refers to the growing power of institutions of global governance such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). But it also refers to the spread and influence of international non-governmental organizations, social movement organizations and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of global civil society.\" Finally, Gerard Delanty and Chris Rumford define it as \"a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of global politics: global geopolitics, global normative culture and polycentric networks.\""]}, {"page": "European Journal of Social Theory", "response": ["The European Journal of Social Theory is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers all aspects social theory.
