On 10 September 1853, he wed Lady Augusta Bingham, the daughter of George Charles Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan. They had three children:-\n\nHumphrey Napier Sturt, 2nd Baron Alington (1859\u20131919) (died of wounds),\nWinifred Selina Sturt (1868\u20131914), and\nMildred Cecilia Harriet Sturt (1869\u20131942), who herself made two notable marriages - first to Henry Cadogan, Viscount Chelsea, and, after his death, to Hedworth Lambton.
