Guest once again sought to create a film that felt as real as possible, using many cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day\u2019s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots he wanted to make that day.", "Critical opinion of Quatermass 2 in the years since its release remains divided. Writing in Science Fiction in the Cinema, John Baxter found the film \u201ca faithful but ponderous adaptation of Kneale's TV sequel. There are effective sequences, director Guest and cameraman Gerald Gibbs shooting with light lancing up through the shadows in a manner reminiscent of Jacques Tourneur's Night (or Curse) of the Demon. Otherwise the film is indifferent\u201d. Similarly, John Brosnan, in his book The Primal Screen, wrote that \u201cQuatermass 2 isn't as good as the first one, despite a bigger budget. Again the theme is possession (all four Quatermass stories are variations on the same theme) with Kneale again cleverly mixing sf with the supernatural. The alien invasion may be sf but it is presented with the trappings of traditional horror, such as the V-shaped \"mark of the devil\" that all possessed people display\u201d. On the other hand, Bill Warren, in Keep Watching The Skies!, found Quatermass 2 to be \u201cone of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. It is not notably better than [The Quatermass Xperiment], but the story idea is more involving, the production is livelier and there are more events in the unfolding of the story\u201d. Kim Newman in 1986 praised the film as \"extraordinary\" and, comparing it to Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Newman notes that while Don Siegel\u2019s film is \"a general allegory\" about dehumanisation and conformity, Quatermass 2 is \u201ca specific attack on the Conservative Government of the time, down to the inclusion of several characters obviously based on real political figures\u201d.Jack Sullivan (ed.)
