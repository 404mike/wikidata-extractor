Nicholas Rudall (1940, in Llanelli, Wales \u2013 19 June 2018) was a Welsh professor of classical languages and literature as well as humanities and Ancient Mediterranean history at the University of Chicago. He specialized in Greek drama, and translated numerous works by Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes. His translations and adaptations are published by Ivan R. Dee of Chicago, for whom he was co-editor of the Plays for Performance Series with longtime friend and colleague Bernard Sahlins. Among undergraduates, Rudall is known particularly for his work with prominent Shakespearean David Bevington, with whom he created and co-taught a two-quarter sequence entitled \"History and Theory of Drama\".\nRudall was the founding director of the Court Theatre in Chicago, where he transformed the school's amateur outdoor summer theater into a multi-million-dollar professional theater focused on classic work. He led the institution for 23 years (1961-1994).\nRudall died on 19 June 2018 at age 78 from complications with colon and liver cancer.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bacchae", "response": ["* Nicholas Rudall, 1996"]}, {"page": "1996 in film", "response": ["| Chain Reaction || 20th Century Fox || Andrew Davis (director); J.

This course was co-taught with actor/translator Nicholas Rudall, dramaturg Drew Dir, Director of Undergraduate Studies in Theater and Performance Studies Heidi Coleman, and actor David New. It is now taught by Professor John Muse, a transition which first occurred when Bevington chose to decrease his teaching hours and focus on Shakespeare-centric classes. The first quarter of this course spans drama from Greek drama to the Renaissance. The second quarter begins with Ibsen's A Doll's House and ends with the postmodern, including Beckett's Endgame and the work of Pinter and Caryl Churchill.  For midterms and finals, students either write a paper critically analyzing a play, or else perform scenes from plays relevant to the course (though not necessarily those read in class). Bevington required, from those opting to perform, a reflection paper analyzing the challenges of staging the scene."]}, {"page": "Nicholas rudall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas Rudall "]}, {"page": "David Grene", "response": ["*The Oresteia, by Aeschylus, translated by David Grene and Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, with introductions by David Grene, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, and Nicholas Rudall, The University of Chicago Press, 1989."]}, {"page": "Nick Rudall", "response": ["#REDIRECTNicholas Rudall"]}, {"page": "Welsh history in Chicago", "response": ["* Nicholas Rudall \u2013 Head of the Classic Department, University of Chicago (retired 2007)."]}, {"page": "Rudall (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Nicholas Rudall (1940\u20132018), Professor of Classical Languages and Literatures, University of Chicago"]}, {"page": "Rudall, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Rudall"]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Nicholas Rudall, 78, British academic and theatre director, colon and liver cancer"]}, {"page": "Sandra Marquez", "response": ["Sandra Marquez is an actor, director, and educator.
