His commercial success was damaged by his often tactless dealings with patrons, and by the enormous scale on which he preferred to work. He was troubled by financial problems throughout his life, which led to several periods of imprisonment for debt. He died by suicide in 1846.\nHe gave lectures on art, and kept extensive diaries that were published after his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antonio Canova", "response": ["Also in 1815, he visited London, and met with Benjamin Haydon.

Keats also met regularly with William Hazlitt, a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed \"a new school of poetry\".Motion (1997) p. 130. At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.\"Keats's letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817 This passage would eventually appear in the concluding lines of \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": Beauty is truth, truth beauty' \u2013 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training, and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, made large loans to friends such as the painter Benjamin Haydon. He would go on to lend \u00a3700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.Bate (1964) p. 632."]}, {"page": "Marathon", "response": ["The name Marathon comes from the legend of Philippides (or Pheidippides), the Greek messenger. The legend states that, while he was taking part in the battle of Marathon, he witnessed a Persian vessel changing its course towards Athens as the battle was near a victorious end for the Greek army. He interpreted this as an attempt by the defeated Persians to rush into the Greek capital and claim a false victory in the Battle of Marathon, which took place in August or September, 490 BC, hence claiming their authority over Greek land. It is said that he ran the entire distance to Athens without stopping, discarding his weapons and even clothes to lose as much weight as possible, and burst into the assembly, exclaiming \u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (nenik\u0113kamen, \"we have won!\"), before collapsing and dying. The account of the run from Marathon to Athens first appears in Plutarch's On the Glory of Athens in the 1st century AD, which quotes from Heraclides Ponticus's lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.Moralia 347C This is the account adopted by Benjamin Haydon for his painting , published as an engraving in 1836 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.

The exact order the poems in which the poems were written is also unknown, but they form a sequence within their structures.
