His commercial success was damaged by his often tactless dealings with patrons, and by the enormous scale on which he preferred to work. He was troubled by financial problems throughout his life, which led to several periods of imprisonment for debt. He died by suicide in 1846.\nHe gave lectures on art, and kept extensive diaries that were published after his death.", "link_mentions": {}}}
