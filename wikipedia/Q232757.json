After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose!
