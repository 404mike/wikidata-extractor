While suspended, Craig was replaced by Harlee Dean in the starting lineup and lost his place in the team for the first time since arriving at Griffin Park. He signed a new contract on 11 November, which would run until the end of the 2016\u201317 season. Craig again lost his starting place to Dean in January 2015 and fell out of the squad entirely when Liam Moore arrived on loan in late February. After Moore was dropped in early March, Craig returned to the bench and did not appear again before the end of the season. Craig finished the 2014\u201315 season having made 24 appearances and departed Griffin Park on 4 July 2015, after his contract was terminated by mutual consent. Craig made 129 appearances in three seasons with Brentford."]}, {"page": "Nigel Pearson", "response": ["After Mandaric and Hoos had departed the club, Pearson was persuaded to rejoin Leicester City under their new ownership by chairman Vichai Raksriaksorn, and after days of negotiations he was finally re-appointed as manager on 15 November 2011 with Leicester sitting 12th in the Championship. Pearson started well, taking seven points from his first three games, which took Leicester into the top six for the first time since he had last been at the club, over 18 months previously, before Leicester faced the Hull City side Pearson had left just 18 days earlier. Leicester lost the game 2\u20131 thanks to a late Robert Koren strike, as Pearson was greeted with chants of \"Judas\" from the Hull fans. That result also signalled a downturn in form, beginning a run which saw Leicester fail to win for 5 consecutive games. However, after the new year, Pearson rang the changes for the trip to Crystal Palace in an attempt to get back to winning ways, recalling Aleksander Tunchev to play his first match of the season and bringing in reserve team player Tom Kennedy and 18-year-old youth academy graduate Liam Moore to make his first team debut for the club. His inexperienced team selection paid off as Leicester earnt a 2\u20131 victory to end their winless run."]}, {"page": "Andy Carroll", "response": ["On 15 November 2021, Reading announced the signing of Carroll on a short-term contract until mid-January 2022.
