In the European view, Islam lacked divine authority and regarded the sword as the route to heaven. Hume appears to represent this view in his reference to the \"bloody principles\" of Islam, though he also makes similar critical comments about the \"bloody designs\" characterizing the conflict between Catholics and Protestants during the Reformation. Many contemporary works about Islam were available to influence Hume's opinions by authors such as Isaac Barrow, Humphrey Prideaux, John Jackson, Charles Wolseley, Hugo Grotius, Paul Rycaut, Thomas Hyde, Pierre Bayle, and Blaise Pascal.

Having foreseen King Henry VIII's intention to dissolve religious houses, Prior Thomas Mundy, a son of Sir John Mundy (died 1537) Lord Mayor of London in 1522, made plans to place the assets of his priory beyond the king's reach, which he did by granting to his friends and relations at nominal ground-rents long leases of the priory's possessions. The manor of Padstow he leased for 99 years at an annual rent of \u00a310 to his niece Johanna Mundy and her husband, William Prideaux (died 1564) of Trevose, St Merryn, Cornwall, a younger son of Humphrey Prideaux (1487\u20131550) of Theuborough, the latter who together with his lawyer brother Nicholas Prideaux (died 1560), had acted as business adviser to the prior. Bodmin Priory was surrendered to the crown by the prior in 1539.", ":On 20 October 1537 he received a 99-year lease of the manor of Padstow from his father-in-law Thomas Munday, the last Prior of Bodmin. He was the second son of Humphrey Prideaux (1487\u20131550) of Theuborough in the parish of Sutcombe, by his first wife Joane Fowell, daughter of Richard Fowell of Fowell's Combe. His father had acquired for him the marriage of Johanna Munday (died 1561), daughter of John Munday of Rialton, the niece of the last Prior of Bodmin, Thomas Mundey, and he married Johanna Munday in 1537. The couple resided at Trevose for as yet no grand manor house existed at Padstow. His son John Prideaux (born 1547) received a lease in 1583 of premises in Padstow from Oliver Polwhele, and his own son John Prideaux (died 1633) was buried in Padstow.

He was the third son of Humphrey Prideaux of Soldon by his wife Honor Fortescue. He inherited Prideaux place from his childless half-uncle John Prideaux (1583\u20131649). During the Civil War he supported the Parliamentarians, and after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 his return to royal favour may have been due to the fact that his sister Elizabeth Prideaux was the wife of Sir William Morice (1602\u20131676) of Werrington, Devon, Secretary of State to King Charles II. 43 letters between Edmund Prideaux and Morrice survive in the library at Prideaux Place. His mother Honor Fortescue is said by tradition to have jumped to her death from the staircase at Prideaux Place, and her ghost, known as \"The Green Lady\" is said to remain at the house. He married Bridget Moyle. His third son was Very Rev. Humphrey Prideaux (1648\u20131724), Dean of Norwich, whose son Edmund Prideaux (1693\u20131745) eventually inherited Prideaux Place.", ":Son of Very Rev.

He was brought up in Norfolk, and in 1728, inherited Prideaux Place from his childless first cousin Edmund Prideaux. He was a connoiseur of art and architecture and went on a grand tour of Italy late in life. He visited many of the great country houses of Devon, Cornwall, Norfolk and elsewhere and made architectural drawings of them, which today are preserved at Prideaux Place. Amongst his drawings are several of Prideaux Place, of Netherton, the seat of his cousins, and of Stowe House, Kilkhampton, in Cornwall, seat of the Grenville Earls of Bath. When Stowe was demolished in the 1720s, it was probably Edmund Prideaux who purchased many of the fittings and installed them at Prideaux Place, where he carried out substantial re-modelling. The present cantilevered staircase in the hall and the wood-panelled \"Grenville Room\" (or Reading Room) both came from Stowe House at that time. In 1717 he married Hannah Wrench (1697\u20131726), daughter of Sir Benjamin Wrench of the City of Norwich.
