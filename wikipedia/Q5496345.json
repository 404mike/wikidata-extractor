He took up his first managerial role in 1896 with Lancashire League side Stockport County and led them to their first title in 1900. Their success saw them elected to the Second Division of the Football League. The club struggled initially and, after being forced to seek re-election on several occasions, Stewart was replaced by Sam Ormerod. However, Ormerod also struggled and Stewart was reinstated a year later. \nHe remained with Stockport until 1911, achieving a highest place finish of 10th in his second spell. He was appointed manager of Southern Football League Second Division side Cardiff City in 1911 and led the side to their first Welsh Cup victory in his first season. The side won promotion to the First Division a year later and were eventually elected into the Second Division of the Football League in 1920. In their first season in the new league, Stewart led the club to promotion to the First Division. \nStewart was in charge of the side during the 1920s when the club enjoyed success by reaching two FA Cup finals, losing in 1925 before becoming the only team from outside England to win the competition in 1927. They also finished as runners-up to Huddersfield Town in the 1923\u201324 First Division season, missing out on the title after failing to win their final game of the season. The later years of the decade saw a steady decline as the club's finances dropped and by 1931 the club had been relegated to the Third Division South. Following a 19th place finish in 1933, Stewart resigned from the role after 22 years. \nDespite managing for more than 30 years, his only two clubs were Stockport and Cardiff and he remains the longest serving manager of both sides as of December 2020.", "link_mentions": {}}}
