He took up his first managerial role in 1896 with Lancashire League side Stockport County and led them to their first title in 1900. Their success saw them elected to the Second Division of the Football League. The club struggled initially and, after being forced to seek re-election on several occasions, Stewart was replaced by Sam Ormerod. However, Ormerod also struggled and Stewart was reinstated a year later. \nHe remained with Stockport until 1911, achieving a highest place finish of 10th in his second spell. He was appointed manager of Southern Football League Second Division side Cardiff City in 1911 and led the side to their first Welsh Cup victory in his first season. The side won promotion to the First Division a year later and were eventually elected into the Second Division of the Football League in 1920. In their first season in the new league, Stewart led the club to promotion to the First Division. \nStewart was in charge of the side during the 1920s when the club enjoyed success by reaching two FA Cup finals, losing in 1925 before becoming the only team from outside England to win the competition in 1927. They also finished as runners-up to Huddersfield Town in the 1923\u201324 First Division season, missing out on the title after failing to win their final game of the season. The later years of the decade saw a steady decline as the club's finances dropped and by 1931 the club had been relegated to the Third Division South. Following a 19th place finish in 1933, Stewart resigned from the role after 22 years. \nDespite managing for more than 30 years, his only two clubs were Stockport and Cardiff and he remains the longest serving manager of both sides as of December 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ninian Park", "response": ["In 1923, plans were initiated to build new dressing rooms and offices at the ground but the project proved too costly. This was partly due to the expense of replacing the sea-washed turf, which had proved troublesome and had been described as \"treacherous\" in the two years since it had been installed. The pitch at the ground would prove problematic for several seasons and the club eventually enlisted the help of seed specialists Suttons to improve the quality of the surface. Victory in the 1927 FA Cup Final raised enough funds for a roof to be erected over the terrace at the Grangetown end of the ground. Built by local company Connies & Meaden Limited, it was officially opened on 1 September 1928 before a league match against Burnley by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Arthur John Howell. It could hold 18,000 spectators. The investment in the stadium proved detrimental to the team as manager Fred Stewart was left with little money to reinvest in an ageing squad. Replacements were sourced from amateur clubs, but the side was relegated to the Football League Third Division South by 1932. With the club's finances dwindling, the board was keen to add new revenue streams. Boxing matches were soon held at Ninian Park with the first professional event in August 1931 featuring former British light-heavyweight champion Frank Moody. The 1932 Cardiff Sports Carnival was also based at the ground, which included the final of the 12-mile road race finishing with three laps around the stands. The idea of installing a greyhound track at the stadium was also proposed the same year but was met with opposition from council and footballing authorities before being abandoned."]}]}}
