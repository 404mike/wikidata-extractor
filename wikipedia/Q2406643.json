(1984\u20131992) was reminiscent of 1970s sitcoms such as Are You Being Served? and Dad's Army:Hannah Hamad \"'Allo 'Allo (1984-92)\"!, BFI screenonline unsurprising since all three involved the writer/producer team of David Croft and  Jeremy Lloyd. Set in World War II Nazi-occupied France and starring Gorden Kaye as Ren\u00e9, a caf\u00e9 owner, a total of 85 episodes were produced over nine series. Croft and Lloyd, who wrote the first six series (the rest were scripted by Lloyd and Paul Adam) devised the concept as a farcical parody of BBC wartime drama Secret Army (1977 to 1979) from which many elements were directly taken. Some actors from Secret Army also appear in 'Allo 'Allo!: Richard Marner, Guy Siner, John D. Collins, Hilary Minster and David Beckett. Although it did not have the same measure of magic as Dad's Army, it retained a strong family following and proved popular with viewers, with respectable ratings. Its success led to it being reproduced on stage. A special entitled The Return of 'Allo 'Allo!, aired in 2007, featuring a number of cast members returning to reprise their original roles in a special story, alongside a documentary about the sitcom including a highlight reel of episodes, and interviews with the cast, production team and fans."]}, {"page": "Timeslip", "response": ["*German Sailor: Hilary Minster"]}, {"page": "Minster", "response": ["* Hilary Minster (1944\u20131999), English character actor"]}, {"page": "1999 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 24 || Hilary Minster || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 55 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "'Allo 'Allo!", "response": ["| Hilary Minster", "The show's premise was not to make fun of the war but to spoof war-based film and TV dramas, and in particular a BBC1 drama Secret Army, which ran from 1977 to 1979 and dealt with the activities of a Belgian \"escape line\" that returned allied pilots to Britain, working from a Brussels caf\u00e9 and later restaurant. Many of the elements and characters are directly taken from Secret Army, such as the caf\u00e9 owner having an affair in the restaurant under the nose of his wife, a bed-ridden woman in a room above who knocks on the floor for attention, a pianist who is also the forger, and the enmity between the Gestapo and the German military. Many storylines for  'Allo 'Allo also derive directly from episodes of Secret Army, such as the valuable paintings and the accompanying forgeries, which both the Germans and the Resistance are seeking to obtain in the Secret Army second series episode \"Weekend\".
