As a result, Quinell and Whittaker were informed the band had split, and Hunt began work on a new record with Mark McCarthy (ex-Radical Dance Faction) and Luke Johnson (ex-Amen and son of one-time Wonder Stuff manager, Les Johnson). Sessions for this new solo record were later joined by Malc Treece.  The result of this was The Wonder Stuff's first new album for over a decade, Escape from Rubbish Island, which was released in September 2004 with \"Better Get Ready for a Fist Fight\" and the title track becoming singles. Andres Karu (who had previously worked with Miles as part of The Miles Hunt Club) replaced Luke Johnson on drums.

In early 2005, the band again toured the UK; Hunt missed the violin sound onstage, which left them unable to play several older tracks. Matt Terry (a friend of Hunt's), had seen a woman busking with a violin in Stratford-upon-Avon, and told Hunt about her. Hunt realised that Terry was describing Firewswitch member Erica Nockalls, whom Hunt had met when the Wonder Stuff was playing a benefit concert.

Around this time, drummer Tony Arthy departed from Jesus Jones. He added recorded EPs with Hunter in 2000, and joined the Wonder Stuff upon being asked. Hunt came across guitarist Dan Donnelly at the end of the 2000s while him and violinist Erica Nockalls were performing on their Never Ending Acoustic Tour. Donnelly audition for Hunt, and was promptly added to the line-up. Hint began writing material for the band's next album at his home, where he made demo recordings. Despite a fruitful January 2015, which saw the creation of five songs, for the next two months, Hunt struggled for more songs. He told Arthy about this, who then asked how the original line-up wrote their debut studio album The Eight Legged Groove Machine (1988), to which he replied by jamming in a rehearsal space. At Arthy's suggestion, all of the members met up in Stourbridge in May 2015 for a period of three days to come up with new songs.", "* Erica Nockalls \u2013 violin, keyboards, backing vocals"]}]}}
