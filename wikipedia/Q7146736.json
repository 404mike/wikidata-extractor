The P.1121 was cancelled after the release of the British Government's 1957 Defence White Paper, which advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. This policy resulted in the termination of the majority of aircraft development projects then underway for the British military.Jefford 2006, p.\u00a011. Hawker sought to quickly move on to a new project and became interested in Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which did not need runways. According to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine this interest may have been stimulated by the presence of Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force.Jefford 2006, pp.\u00a011\u201312."]}, {"page": "Order of the British Empire", "response": ["|Air Chief Marshal|| Sir Patrick Hine||||1991"]}, {"page": "RAF Strike Command", "response": ["*Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine 1988\u20131991"]}, {"page": "Operation Granby", "response": ["The Joint Commander Gulf Forces, based in the United Kingdom at RAF High Wycombe, was Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Sir Patrick Hine 1 October 1990 \u2013 31 March 1991, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon from 31 March 1991.

Aviation author Francis K. Mason expressed a contrary view, stating that Hawker's decision to proceed was independent of British government initiatives, and that the P.1127 project was primarily based upon the NATO requirement instead. Hawker had a keen ally in its development in the form of Bristol, but by that point the latter was experiencing financial difficulties, and the lack of foreseeable commercial applications for the Pegasus engine in particular, coupled with refusals from HM Treasury, meant that development would have to be financed by NATO institutions instead. The close cooperation between Hawker and Bristol was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis as a key factor which had enabled the P.1127's development to proceed in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.Jefford 2006, p. 23."]}, {"page": "Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)", "response": ["| Sir Patrick Hine KCB"]}, {"page": "King of Arms of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["|Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, GCB, GBE"]}, {"page": "Coalition of the Gulf War", "response": ["* Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine RAF -  joint commander of all British forces "]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Patrick Hine||1932\u2013"]}, {"page": "Brabazon Trophy", "response": ["| 1949 || Stoneham Golf Club ||  Patrick Hine || 287"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*1991: Jeremy Black, Sir Patrick Hine, Brian Jenkins"]}, {"page": "Air Member for Materiel", "response": ["*27 November 1987 Air Marshal Sir Patrick Hine                 "]}, {"page": "1989 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, , Royal Air Force."]}]}}
