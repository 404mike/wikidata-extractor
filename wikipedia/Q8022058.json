Aged 11, Oxley played for G. D. Cunningham, the Birmingham City Organist, whose advice was that Oxley should study at King Edward's School, Birmingham (to which he won a scholarship in 1946) and aim for a career as a musician. He won a silver medal from the Associated Board for his results in a piano examination when he was 12, and won the under-20 piano class aged 13.  As a pupil at King Edward's, he studied under the school's Director of Music, Willis Grant, who appointed him as his Assistant.  He became organ scholar of Christ Church, Oxford in 1951, under Thomas Armstrong; he was appointed assistant organist in 1953 and obtained a first-class degree in music from the University of Oxford in 1954.
