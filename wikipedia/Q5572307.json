Gluck joined the Lamorna artists\u2019 colony near Penzance, and was noted for portraits and floral paintings, as well as a new design of picture-frame.

", "From 1943 Maufe was principal architect UK to the Imperial War Graves Commission, eventually becoming chief architect and artistic adviser until 1969. Among his war memorial designs are those at Tower Hill which was an expansion to the already established memorial by Sir Edward Lutyens and the Air Forces Memorial at Cooper's Hill overlooking Runnymede (1950\u201353). Maufe's domestic work had a stylish modernity, in direct contrast with the new functionalism. In the architectural language of the time it was called \u2018modernity with manners\u2019 and very much reflected the established taste of the inter-war period. Maufe often wrote and lectured on architecture chiefly on furnishing within the home and on present-day architecture. His designs were considered by interior designers to be modern and stylish, with built-in fitments and pastel colour-schemes, particularly pink, mauve, and cream, contrasted with silver-lacquered furniture and mirrors. One of his house designs was Yaffle Hill, Broadstone, Dorset, built in 1929 for Cyril Carter of Poole Pottery. Other schemes included an extension to Baylins, Beaconsfield in 1927, for Ambrose Heal, Hanah Gluck's studio in Bolton Hill, Hampstead (1932), and the studio for religious services at Broadcasting House (1931). He also designed several branch banks for Lloyds Bank, including 50 Notting Hill Gate, London in 1930."]}, {"page": "1937 in art", "response": ["* Gluck \u2013 Medallion"]}, {"page": "1978 in art", "response": ["* 10 January \u2013 Gluck, born Hannah Gluckstein, English painter (b. 1895)"]}, {"page": "1895 in art", "response": ["* August 13 \u2013 Gluck, born Hannah Gluckstein, English painter (died 1978)"]}, {"page": "Gluck (disambiguation)", "response": ["Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714\u20131787) was a composer of Italian and French opera.", "Gluck may also refer to:", "* Gl\u00fcck or Gluck, a surname and list of people with the name", "* 7624 Gluck, a main-belt asteroid", "* Gluck (card game)", "* Gluck (crater), a crater on Mercury", "* Gluck (painter) (1895\u20131978), British painter (birth name Hannah Gluckstein)"]}, {"page": "Margaret Furse", "response": ["A portrait is in the permanent collection of London's National Portrait Gallery.

Together with her husband, who was 30 years older, she led an international existence. The couple lived variously in their home in the English countryside, their flat in London, or their villa at Grasse on the French Riviera. They wintered in Switzerland to take advantage of the sporting events and spent their summers in Venice. Sawyer once claimed that after her marriage she and her husband rarely stayed \"more than three nights in any one place\". She was known for her daring, obtaining a pilot's licence against her husband's wishes, and later learning to surf. She also earned competitive gold medals for speed skating and skiing. In 1932, at a dinner party given by Molly, Lady Mount Temple, she met the artist Gluck.", "With her husband's encouragement, Sawyer began writing plays. Her first production, Black Magic, opened at the Royalty Theatre in London in 1931. It was staged in 1935 by the Theatre Guild in New York City and adapted for television, airing in 1938. Her second play So Good, So Kind was presented in 1933 at the Playhouse Theatre, as was Little White Lies, which opened the autumn season. She also read dramas, poems, and comedies on BBC Radio throughout the 1930s and 1940s. During this same period, Sawyer's relationship with Gluck intensified. On 25 May 1936, Gluck confided to her diary that the two were married, had exchanged rings, and the date became their anniversary. Their affair lasted until 1944 and was marked by the creation of Medallion, which Gluck called the YouWe Picture. It is a dual portrait of Gluck and Sawyer, inspired by their attendance in 1936 of Fritz Busch's production of Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. Gluck acknowledged Sawyer as her one great love and her inspiration, saving the letters that they had written in a shoebox, which was discovered after her death.", "In 1969, Obermer moved to Switzerland, settling in Le Tourbillon, a luxury estate in the Canton of Vaud. She continued her social lifestyle, entertaining such notables as Joyce Carey, Diana Menuhin, Graham Payn, Ginette Spanier, Joan Sutherland, as well as Gluck and her new partner Edith Shackleton Heald. In 1972, Obermer helped Gluck mount what would be her last solo exhibit, inviting her personal contacts to ensure its success. In 1978, she was honoured by Northwood University in Midland, Michigan with their Distinguished Women Award for her philanthropy and stature as a role model for women.", "Obermer died on 3 October 1984 in Paudex, (near Lausanne) in Vaud, Switzerland. The scholarship fund established in her name is still granted by the University of Hawaii.
