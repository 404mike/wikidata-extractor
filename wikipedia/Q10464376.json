He played for Aston Villa, Cardiff City, Norwich City, Millwall, Chelmsford City, Kettering Town, Peterborough United, Luton Town, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southend United, Port Vale, and Halifax Town. He was twice named on the PFA Team of the Year and was promoted out of the Second Division with Wolves in 1982\u201383.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derek Dougan", "response": ["Dougan was appointed player-manager at Southern League Premier Division side Kettering Town in 1975, and immediately set on former Wolves teammate Brian Thompson as his assistant. Goalkeeper Gordon Livsey remembered Dougan as a great motivator, but tactically limited. Dougan negotiated a four figure shirt sponsorship with Kettering Tyres, which was the first such deal in England. After its use in the Southern League Premier Division match against Bath City on 24 January 1976 the FA demanded that the club remove the sponsor's logo threatening a fine of \u00a31000, and were not impressed when Dougan initially attempted to circumvent the FA's demands by shortening the branding 'Kettering Tyres' to simply 'Kettering T'.James Ferguson: \"Defining Moment: Kettering Town puts a logo on its football shirts, January 1976\", Financial Times, 27 February 2020 The logo was removed, though in June 1977 the FA decreed that a 2.5 square inch logo would be permitted in the future provided it was not \"detrimental to the image of the game\". He led the \"Poppies\" to a third-place league finish and the Third Round of the FA Cup in 1976\u201377. He helped to improve the career prospects of many of his players, particularly Billy Kellock, who went on to play over 250 games in the Football League after leaving Kettering in 1979. Dougan left the club after chairman John Nash resigned in June 1977."]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town. Tommy Gore soon announced his retirement due to a neck injury. The Vale then went five games unbeaten, as the club announced a new five year shirt sponsorship deal with Trentham firm Eagle Delivery Service. Young winger Ray Walker also arrived on loan from Aston Villa. The fans chanted 'what a load of rubbish' on 1 October, as Vale lost 3\u20130 at home to struggling side Northampton Town. Rudge stated that 'In truth we were rubbish' and promptly cancelled the player's day off. Another five game unbeaten run followed, as Brown showed his 'class' and Walker impressed. On 5 November, Eamonn O'Keefe scored a 'brilliant' hat-trick past Southend United in a 4\u20131 win. Rudge then signed Stockport County's outside-right Oshor Williams for \u00a37,000. Vale's form then suffered after Walker returned to Villa Park. To remedy this Rudge signed Southend United midfielder Billy Kellock, who made 'a stunning impact' in his debut, playing a key part in the 5\u20131 victory over Exeter City on New Year's Day. This was the first of a sixteen-game unbeaten run, in which the team equalled a club-record six straight away draws between 19 January and 29 March.", "On the financial side, a loss was made of \u00a37,793 due to a 20% drop in attendance figures.

Five players left on free transfers, most significant were the departures of: Terry Armstrong and Derek Monaghan (retired); Colin Tartt (Shepshed Charterhouse); and Ian Griffiths (Wigan Athletic). Billy Kellock also refused terms, and so joined Halifax Town, whilst John Ridley joined Stafford Rangers as a player-coach.
