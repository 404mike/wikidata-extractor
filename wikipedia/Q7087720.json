Transferring in April 1883 to the King's Royal Rifle Corps, he was promoted to captain on 15 October 1890 and served in the Hazara, Miranzai (where he was mentioned in dispatches) and Chitral expeditions, being mentioned in dispatches again and being awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Promoted to major on 21 October 1899, he then served in the Second Boer War where he was wounded and taken prisoner at the battle of Talana Hill.After his return to the United Kingdom, he was on 19 October 1902 appointed deputy assistant quartermaster general to the 3rd Army Corps, stationed in Ireland. The First World War saw him serving in England until 1915 when he was appointed to command the 41st Infantry Brigade (part of the 14th (Light) Division) on the Western Front. In September 1915 he was appointed to command the 36th (Ulster) Division with which he served until 1918. He was promoted Major-General 1 January 1916.\n\nNugent devised the strategy that led to the Ulster Division going 'over the top' twenty minutes before Zero Hour. This  allowed his soldiers to get the advantage and capture the main objective of the Schwaben Redoubt. However along the rest of the line, the attack faltered and this caused the 36th Division to withdraw.\nHe commanded the Meerut Division in India from August 1918 to 1920, and retired in 1920 to the family estate in Farren Connell, County Cavan, where he died from pneumonia on 31 May 1926.\nNugent's portrait by William Conor is in Belfast City Hall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "36th (Ulster) Division", "response": ["The Ulster Volunteers were a unionist militia founded in 1912 to block Home Rule for Ireland.
