Born in London, he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1805. Except for one year he exhibited annually at the Royal Academy from 1811 until his death. He was elected A.R.A. on 1 November 1830 and R.A. on 10 February 1840. He retired as an academician on 28 May 1863.\nHis early works were mostly landscapes, but the influence of artists like George Morland (1763\u20131804) can be seen in the importance he gave to the figurative element in his paintings.\nWitherington enjoyed painting English scenery and never travelled abroad. As with many of his works, he does not depict the harsh realities of rural life, but instead records incidents of family life. Like his contemporary, Augustus Wall Callcott, RA, he creates a composition with a lively foreground of figures and animals, combined with a landscape with distant vistas glimpsed through the wood.\nHe died on the 19th April, aged 79, and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. His grave (plot no.13865) no longer has a headstone or any marker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richmond Park", "response": ["The Earl of Dysart's Family in Richmond Park by William Frederick Witherington (1785\u20131865) is in The Hearsum Collection at Pembroke Lodge."]}, {"page": "James Dafforne", "response": ["|William Frederick Witherington"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| William Frederick Witherington   ||align=\"center\" |  1840  || "]}, {"page": "Penguin Popular Classics", "response": ["| Vanity Fair || William Makepeace Thackeray ||  || William Frederick Witherington"]}]}}
