After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his \"keen and fearless\" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3\u20131 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935\u201336 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games."]}, {"page": "1977 in Wales", "response": ["*date unknown - Cecil Smith, footballer"]}, {"page": "Cecil Smith", "response": ["Cecil Smith may refer to:", "*Cecil Smith (figure skater) (1908\u20131997), Canadian figure skater", "*Cecil Smith (politician) (1927\u20131988), Manitoba member of Canadian Parliament", "*Cecil Smith (footballer, born 1904) (1904\u20131977), Welsh footballer", "*Cecil Smith (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u20131990), English footballer", "*Cecil Smith (polo) (1904\u20131999), American polo player", "*Cecil Smith (Auditor General), Auditor General of Sri Lanka", "*Cecil Smith (track and field) (1936-2016), athletics coach and builder, publisher", "*R.
