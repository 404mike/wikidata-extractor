Graduating from Oxford in 1976 he attended a Law School in Guildford, Surrey. A further scholarship in literature and the fine arts took him to a cultural foundation at Vence in France. He became organist of the Basilica of Notre Dame de Nice, taught music at a choir school for boys in Grasse, and studied music at the Nice Conservatoire.\nHe has performed (as a solo singer, organist, and conductor) in almost every western and central European country. His performances in the British Isles include a song recital at St John's, Smith Square, and St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. He is based mainly in France.\nMonckton also lectures around the world. In 2005, he formed a travel company, Thomas Martlet Ltd, to organize cultural tours to places of artistic, architectural and musical interest.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Greshamians", "response": ["*Christopher J.
