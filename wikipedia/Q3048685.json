Neale, who had been stationed in Beijing from 1860 as Secretary of the Legation following the settlement of the Second Opium War, was transferred to Japan in March 1862, when Rutherford Alcock went home on leave.

Reportedly, Richardson had failed to yield for Shimazu's entourage while travelling on a road near Kawasaki, Kanagawa, and was subsequently killed under Kiri-sute gomen \u2013 the right for samurai to kill people of lower class for perceived disrespect. Richardson's death sparked outrage from Europeans for violating the extraterritoriality they enjoyed under terms of the Unequal treaties. Lieutenant-Colonel Edward St. John Neale, the British Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires, demanded from the Bakufu (the central government of the Tokugawa Shogunate) an apology and a indemnity of \u00a3100,000, representing roughly 1/3 of the total revenues of the Bakufu for one year.Totman, pp.68\u201369 Neale kept threatening a naval bombardment of Edo, the Tokugawa capital city, if the payment was not made.Totman, p. 71 Britain also demanded the Satsuma Domain arrest and put on trial the perpetrators of Richardson's death, and \u00a325,000 compensation for the surviving victims and the relatives of Richardson.

However, in May 1862, Lieutenant Colonel Edward St. John Neale who had assumed duties as Charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Japan during Alcock's period of extended home leave ordered the legation to be returned to T\u014dzenji, pending the construction of a new purpose-built diplomatic compound at nearby Gotenyama. The staff, including a contingent from the Royal Marines, numbered around 30 men. The Shogunate ordered \u014cgaki, Kishiwada and Matsumoto Domains to provide security, for a total of 500 men. One of the guards from Matsumoto, It\u014d Gunbei, was concerned about the expense his domain was incurring providing this security and about the possibility that he would be forced to kill fellow Japanese in order to protect the hated foreigners, so he decided to assassinate Neale himself. In the early morning of  June 27, 1862 he attempted to break into Neale's bedroom but was discovered by the Royal Marines and killed two men from the HMS Renard before he was subdued. He subsequently committed seppuku, and the British withdrew back to  Yamate, in Yokohama. The incident resulted in the creation of the permanent British Military Garrison in Japan and marked the final abandonment of the use of T\u014dzen-ji as the official residence of the British legation in Japan."]}, {"page": "Neale (surname)", "response": ["* Edward St. John Neale, Lieutenant-Colonel and British representative in Japan (1862-1863)"]}, {"page": "Colonel Neale", "response": ["#Redirect Edward St. John Neale"]}, {"page": "Lieutenant-Colonel Neale", "response": ["#Redirect Edward St. John Neale"]}, {"page": "Alexander von Siebold", "response": ["Alexander assisted British consul Edward St. John Neale during the Anglo-Satsuma War and was based on the flagship  during the conflict.
