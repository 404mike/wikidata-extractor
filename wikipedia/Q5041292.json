Because no Turkic word with a similar meaning is known, \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry connected the ethnonym to the Kirghiz words kangir (\"agile\"), kangirmak (\"to go out riding\") and kani-kara (\"black-blooded\"), while Carlile Aylmer Macartney associated it with the Chagatai word gang (\"chariot\"). Omeljan Pritsak proposed that the name had initially been a composite term (K\u00e4ng\u00e4r As) deriving from the Tocharian word for stone (kank) and the Iranian ethnonym As.

Its principal subject is the conquest of the Carpathian Basin and it narrates the background and the immediate aftermath of the conquest. Many historiansincluding Carlile Aylmer Macartney and Andr\u00e1s R\u00f3na-Tasagree that Simon of K\u00e9za's chronicle, the Illuminated Chronicle and other works composed in the 13th\u201315th centuries preserved texts which had been written before the completion of the Gesta. They say that the first \"Hungarian Chronicle\" was completed in the second half of the 11th century or in the early 12th century. The existence of this ancient chronicle is proven by later sources. One Ricardus's report of a journey of a group of Dominican friars in the early 1230s refers to a chronicle, The Deeds of the Christian Hungarians, which contained information of an eastern Magna Hungaria. The Illuminated Chronicle from 1358 refers to \"the ancient books about the deeds of the Hungarians\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 82), p. 111. in connection with the pagan uprisings of the 11th century. The earliest \"Hungarian Chronicle\" was expanded and rewritten several times in the 12th\u201314th centuries, but its content can only be reconstructed based on 14th-century works.", "The view of modern historians on the Gesta Hungarorum is mixed: some consider it a reliable source; others consider its information doubtful. Alexandru Madgearu, who wrote a monography of the Gesta Hungarorum, concluded that the \"analysis of several fragments of\" the Gesta Hungarorum \"has demonstrated that this work is generally credible, even if it ignores important events and characters and even if it makes some chronological mistakes\". According to Neagu Djuvara, the factual accuracy of Anonymus's work is likely high, because it is the earliest preserved Hungarian chronicle and is based on even older Hungarian chronicles. On the other hand, Carlile Aylmer Macartney described Anonymus's work as \"the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts\" in his book of medieval Hungarian historians. Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes in his critical and analytical guide of Anonymus \"this is not evidence that he introduced the whole person of Gelou or the presence of Vlachs in Transylvania\". Paul Robert Magocsi also regarded the Gesta as an unreliable work. Dennis Deletant joins the opinion that it is a debatable chronicle, but he categorically states that the Romanians had continuity and that they were in Transylvania before the arrival of the Hungarians, as described in Gesta Hungarorum."]}, {"page": "Hungarian prehistory", "response": ["The first Hungarian chronicles were written in the late 11th or early  but their texts were preserved in manuscripts compiled in the 13th to 15th centuries. Most extant chronicles show that the earliest works contained no information on the history of the Hungarians before their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century. The only exception is the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle, whose principal subject is the Magyars' pagan past. However, the reliability of this work, which was written by a former royal notary now known as Anonymus, is suspect. In his monograph of medieval Hungarian historians, Carlile Aylmer Macartney describes it as \"the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts\"."]}, {"page": "Menumorut", "response": ["Many historians debate the reliability of the reports of the Gesta concerning Menumorut and the other opponents of the Magyars who are not named in other primary sources.

According to Neagu Djuvara, the factual accuracy of Anonymus's work is likely high, because it is the earliest preserved Hungarian chronicle and is based on even older Hungarian chronicles. On the other hand, Krist\u00f3 writes that Anonymus, who had little information of the real conditions of the Carpathian Basin around 900, could only turn \"to one thing when he outlined the history of the Hungarian conquest: his own imagination,\" and Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy says that Menumorut was one of the personalities whom Anonymus invented and named after a location. The existence of two villages named \"Morut's house\" (Mar\u00f3tlaka in Hungarian) and a clan Morut in Bihar County in the 13th century is well-documented, proving that at least one Morut had settled in this region. Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes that the majority of events that the Gesta mentions in connection with Menumorut are \"a simple repetition, with variants\" of the story of Salan in the same chronicle, showing that Anonymus \"had little material on which to work\" when writing about Menumorut. Historian Ryszard Grzesik says that Menumorut \"never existed and never ruled over Bihar\", but \"it was not an invented person\". He writes that Menumorut's name derived from the Turkic adjective m\u00e9n\u00fc (\"great\") and the Moravians' Hungarian exonym, mar\u00f3t, thus he says that Menumorut was the \"personification\" of Svatopluk I of Moravia."]}, {"page": "Gelou", "response": ["According to Anonymus, Gelou \"was not steadfast and did not have around him good warriors\". The Vlachs and Slavs of Transylvania were \"the basest of the whole world\" because \"they had nothing else for arms than bows and arrows\"; Transylvanian weakness was the result of frequent raids by \"the Cumans and Pechenegs\". According to Ioan Aurel Pop, Anonymus' description of Gelou's subjects indicates a sedentary people called to arms. Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes that the Blasii and Picenati words for Vlachs and Pechenegs and the reference to their \"bows and arrows\" suggest that Anonymus borrowed the text from a work describing the route of the Third or Fourth Crusade across the Balkans; the late-12th-century Historia de expeditione Friderici imperatoris refers to Vlachs and Cumanians and their bows and arrows. Based on Anonymus's narrative, S\u0103l\u0103gean says that Gelou's polity was small compared with the other five mentioned in the Gesta Hungarorum."]}, {"page": "Ajtony", "response": ["The principal source of Ajtony's life is the Long Life of Saint Gerard, compiled from a number of earlier sources in the early 14th century. According to modern historians (including Carlile Aylmer Macartney and Florin Curta), all information on Ajtony incorporated into the Long Life was based on a ballad about the heroic deeds of Csan\u00e1d\u2014Ajtony's former commander-in-chief\u2014because a shorter version of Bishop Gerard of Csan\u00e1d's life does not mention Ajtony. Most historians agree that the ballad was composed shortly after Ajtony's death. In addition to the Long Life, Ajtony is mentioned in the Gesta Hungarorum; the Hungarian chronicle was written after around 1150. According to the Gesta, Ajtony was descended from Glad (in the same source, lord of the Banat); however, its credibility is questioned. In a 1499 sermon the Franciscan Osv\u00e1t Laskai wrote that Ajtony was from the Ny\u00edrs\u00e9g region, but no evidence exists to indicate that Laskai knew his place of birth."]}, {"page": "Gerard of Csan\u00e1d", "response": ["The Long Life of Saint Gerard is a compilation of multiple sources, including the biography that the author of the shorter legend had also utilized. The Long Life was completed in the late 13th century or in the 14th century. It was regarded as a source of absolute reliability for centuries, but this view radically changed in the 20th century. Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy even stated that the Long Life was a forgery. Historian G\u00e1bor Klaniczay also emphasizes that the longer legend contains obviously anachronistic elements.

Historians have continuously debated the reliability of Anonymus's work which was first published in 1746. Anonymus's reference to the Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs supporting Glad is one of the key points in the scholarly debate, because the Cumans did not arrive in Europe before the 1050s. Vlad Georgescu, Victor Spinei, Ioan-Aurel Pop and many other Romanian historians identify the \"Cumans\", or Cumani, as Pechenegs, Avars or Kabars, saying that the Hungarian word that Anonymus translated as \"Cuman\" (kun) originally dubbed any Turkic tribe. According to other historians, including Dennis Deletant, Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy and Carlile Aylmer Macartney, Anonymus's reference to the three peoples is an anachronism, which reflects the ethnic composition of the late 13th-century Bulgaria."]}, {"page": "Xionites", "response": ["Differences between the Xionites, the Huns who invaded Europe in the 4th century, and the Turks were emphasised by Carlile Aylmer Macartney (1944), who suggested that the name \"Chyon\", originally that of an unrelated people, was \"transferred later to the Huns owing to the similarity of sound\". The Chyon who appeared in the 4th century, in the steppes on the northeastern frontier of Persia were probably a branch of the Huns that appeared shortly afterwards in Europe. The Huns appear to have attacked and conquered the Alans, then living between the Urals and the Volga about 360 AD, and the first mention of the Chyon was in 356 AD."]}, {"page": "Macartney, C.A.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carlile Aylmer Macartney"]}, {"page": "Nicolae Petrescu-Comnen", "response": ["Choosing to remain in exile to Italy after the Soviet occupation of Romania, Petrescu-Comnen spoke out against communization and lectured in particular against the Danubian Confederation project; nevertheless, he intervened to mitigate the effects of drought and famine in his native country.Petrescu, pp. 349\u2013350 By 1947, he was also collecting and publishing in Florence his records of the war, and of his own part in it, as  (\"Preludes of the Great Tragedy\"), followed in 1949 by the more detailed  (\"The Culprits\"), at Mondadori.
