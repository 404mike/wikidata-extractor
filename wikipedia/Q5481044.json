By summer 1714 the debate on The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity had ramified, and provoked a formal complaint from the Lower House of Convocation: the Blasphemy Act 1697 still made it an offence for \"any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity\". Clarke drew up an apologetic preface, and then gave explanations which satisfied the Upper House of Convocation. He had strong supporters among the bishops. Clarke promised not to preach or write on the topic. Arthur Ashley Sykes and John Jackson from then on acted as his proxies. Other main participants in the controversy were John Edwards, Francis Gastrell, James Knight who published with Bull's biographer Robert Nelson, Richard Mayo of Great Kimble (son of the nonconformist Richard Mayo), Stephen Nye, Edward Welchman and Edward Wells."]}, {"page": "Boyle Lectures", "response": ["* 1697 - The Certainty of the Christian Revelation and the Necessity of believing it, established, by Francis Gastrell (Bishop of Chester)"]}, {"page": "Milnrow", "response": ["Declared religion from 2001 was recorded as 80% Christian, 0.8% Muslim, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Buddhist, and 0.1% Jewish.

In 1717, Francis Gastrell, the then Bishop of Chester, noted there were \"a few [...] avowed Presbyterians\" in Milnrow. In 1773, Baptists established a chapel at Ogden; the building closed in 1964 with the congregation moving to a new building in Newhey in 1972, but retaining the name Ogden Baptist Church. The Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion established a school in Milnrow in 1840, and St Stephen's Church building in 1861, attracting clergy and worshippers with leanings to Methodism and Calvinism; the congregation severed ties with the Connexion in 1865, and chose to join the Congregational Union.", "Milnrow has a \"distinct and separate character\". It is one of the towns of northern England that observed the custom of Rushbearing, an annual Anglican religious festival where rushes are brought by rushcart to by strewn in the parish church to refresh the flooring. Milnrow's Rushbearing occurred on the Sunday prior to St James's Day, and in 1717, Francis Gastrell, the Bishop of Chester, wrote that Milnrow's festival was a particularly \"disorderly custom\". Parishioners would travel as far as Marsden to gather rushes. Established in 1968, Milnrow and Newhey Carnival is an annual summer community parade with floats, morris dancers and brass bands. The Milnrow Band is a British brass band ranked as a \"top class group of amateur musicians\". It formed from a succession of mergers and amalgamations of Milnrow- and Rochdale-based brass bands, the earliest of which was St Stephen's Band founded in Milnrow in 1869. In 2006 it was promoted to the top-rank Championship section of Great Britain, and in 2017 were the All England Masters International Champions. In his 2015 memoir, the Manchester-born comedy-singer Mike Harding recalled \"a place called Milnrow, on the extreme edge of the then known world, [...where...] everything stopped for pie and peas\"."]}, {"page": "Calveley", "response": ["*Francis Gastrell.

He gained a reputation as an outspoken enemy of the local Roman Catholic inhabitants, who were in the majority. In November 1715, when Jacobite forces came to Preston, Peploe is said to have preached a brave sermon urging support for King George I, who had become king the previous year. His sermons on the dangers of popery also brought him wider attention, and in 1717 he was nominated as the warden of Manchester collegiate church; however, Francis Gastrell, as Bishop of Chester, refused to sanction the appointment on the basis that Peploe's Lambeth degree of Bachelor of Divinity was not a valid qualification. It took many years of litigation before it was ruled that Lambeth degrees, which are awarded by the Archbishop of Canterbury, were of equal status with university degrees. For that reason he returned to Jesus College and obtained his Bachelor of Divinity degree on 10 March 1718."]}, {"page": "Francis Robert Raines", "response": ["*Francis Gastrell, Notitia Cestriensis: Or Historical Notices of the Diocese of Chester (1850) editor"]}, {"page": "John Mapletoft", "response": ["On 18 November 1679 Mapletoft married Rebecca, daughter of Lucy Knightley of Hackney, a Hamburg merchant, and younger brother of the Knightleys of Fawsley in Northamptonshire.
