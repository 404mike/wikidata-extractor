Freke and Gandy argue that orthodox Christianity was not the predecessor to Gnosticism, but a later outgrowth that rewrote history in order to make literal Christianity appear to predate the Gnostics. They describe their theory as the \"Jesus Mysteries thesis\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christ myth theory", "response": ["According to Doherty, the Christ of Paul shares similarities with the Greco-Roman mystery cults.
