His prosody \u2013 notably his concept of sprung rhythm \u2013 established him as an innovator, as did his praise of God through vivid use of imagery and nature. Only after his death did Robert Bridges publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 Hopkins's work was seen as one of the most original literary advances of his century. It intrigued such leading 20th-century poets as T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis.", "Hopkins studied classics at Balliol College, Oxford (1863\u20131867).W. H. Gardner (1963), Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems and Prose Penguin p. xvii. He began his time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet, but seems to have alarmed himself with resulting changes in his behaviour. There he forged a lifelong friendship with Robert Bridges (later Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom), which would be important to his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim. Hopkins was deeply impressed with the work of Christina Rossetti, who became one of his great contemporary influences and met him in 1864.Gardner, W. H. (1963) Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems and Prose Penguin p. xviii. During this time he studied with the writer and critic Walter Pater, who tutored him in 1866 and remained a friend until Hopkins left Oxford for the second time in October 1879.Jude Nixon (1993), Gerard Manley Hopkins and His Contemporaries, Liddon, Newman, Darwin, and Pater p. 175.", "Hopkins was a supporter of linguistic purism in English. In an 1882 letter to Robert Bridges, Hopkins writes: \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity.\"Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p. 328. He took time to learn Old English, which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English \"a vastly superior thing to what we have now.\"Brook, George Leslie (1955). An Introduction to Old English, Manchester University Press, p. 1.", "During his lifetime, Hopkins published few poems. It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins's death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then poet laureate, published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by Charles Williams, appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by William Henry Gardner appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).", "Timothy d'Arch Smith, antiquarian bookseller, ascribes to Hopkins suppressed erotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met Robert Bridges's distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian Digby Mackworth Dolben, \"a Christian Uranian\".Timothy d'Arch Smith. Love in Earnest, p. 188. Robert Martin asserts that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben's 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it \"was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.\"Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life, p. 80; see also Norman White, Hopkins: A Literary Biography, p. 110. According to Robert Martin, \"Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.\"Robert Bernard Martin, \"Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben,\" DNB) Martin also considers it \"probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.\"", "Hopkins composed two poems about Dolben, \"Where art thou friend\" and \"The Beginning of the End\". Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben's poems as well as Hopkins's, cautioned that the second poem \"must never be printed,\" though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918). Another indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins's high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Hopkins never saw Dolben again after the latter's short visit to Oxford during which they met, and any continuation of their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben's drowning two years later in June 1867. Hopkins's feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time, but he was nonetheless greatly affected by his death. \"Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben's death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ... [for] many of Hopkins's best poems \u2013 impregnated with an elegiac longing for Dolben, his lost beloved and his muse \u2013 were the result.\"Michael M. Kaylor, Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde. Brno, CZ: Masaryk University Press, 2006. p. 401.

On his appointment The Times wrote of him: \"his poetry could touch to beauty the plain speech of everyday life\".The Times, 1930. Masefield took his appointment seriously and produced a large quantity of poems for royal occasions, which were sent to The Times for publication. Masefield's modesty was shown by his inclusion of a stamped and self-addressed envelope with each submission so that the poem could be returned if it was found unacceptable. Later he was commissioned to write a poem to be set to music by the Master of the King's Musick, Sir Edward Elgar, and performed at the unveiling of the Queen Alexandra Memorial by the King on 8 June 1932. This was the ode \"So many true Princesses who have gone\"."]}, {"page": "Macbeth", "response": ["Yet for other critics, it has not been so easy to resolve the question of Macbeth's motivation. Robert Bridges, for instance, perceived a paradox: a character able to express such convincing horror before Duncan's murder would likely be incapable of committing the crime. For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first act appear vague and insufficient. John Dover Wilson hypothesised that Shakespeare's original text had an extra scene or scenes where husband and wife discussed their plans. This interpretation is not fully provable; however, the motivating role of ambition for Macbeth is universally recognised. The evil actions motivated by his ambition seem to trap him in a cycle of increasing evil, as Macbeth himself recognises: \"I am in bloodStepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er.\""]}, {"page": "October 23", "response": ["*  1844   \u2013 Robert Bridges, English poet and playwright (d. 1930)"]}, {"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["Writers associated with Oxford include Vera Brittain, A.S.

While Hardy first established his reputation the late 19th century with novels, he also wrote poetry throughout his career. However he did not publish his first collection until 1898, so that he tends to be treated as a 20th-century poet.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble, p. 439. Gerard Manley Hopkins's Poems were posthumously published in 1918 by Robert Bridges."]}]}}
