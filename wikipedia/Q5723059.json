Otto Jespersen found similar examples (\"pronouns or nouns plus I after a preposition\", in Robert J. Menner's words) in Ben Jonson, John Bunyan, Charles Dickens, and Graham Greene, and Menner adds Noah Webster, Samuel Pepys, Thomas Middleton, and others.", "The cause for this particular error is given by such authorities as a kind of trauma deriving from incorrect usage caused by \"you\" being both nominative and oblique, and the awareness of the possible incorrectness of \"me\": \"People make this mistake because they know it's not correct to say, for example, 'John and me went to the shops'. They know that the correct sentence would be 'John and I went to the shops'. But they then mistakenly assume that the words 'and me' should be replaced by 'and I' in all cases.\" Writer Constance Hale notes that Ernest Hemingway frequently made such pronoun errors\u2014\"Gertrude Stein and me are just like brothers.\" In The Language Wars (2011), Henry Hitchings provides a similar explanation, adding that for many speakers \"you and I\" seem to belong together, which is noted also by Kenneth Wilson. That the problem typically occurs when two pronouns are used together is widely recognized: \"these problems rarely arise when the pronoun [I] stands alone\". James Cochrane, author of Between You and I: A Little Book of Bad English (2004), gives a similar explanation\u2014in this case, \"people\"'s feeling some unease with a sentence like \"Me and Bill went out for beers\"; Cochrane does not, however, mark it as a hypercorrection, and suggests the phrase only came about \"in the last twenty or so years\"\u2014linguist J. K. Chambers, however, points out that the usage is not \"a change in progress\".", "More complex explanations than \"trauma\" or \"unease\" are provided by linguists and sociolinguists. Without expanding on the topic, Henry Hitchings considers the phrase a very specific, class-oriented kind of hypercorrection, which he calls \"hyperurbanism\", which \"involves avoiding what is believed to be a 'low' mistake and using a supposedly classier word or pronunciation, although in fact the result is nothing of the sort\". A similar reason is given by Bryan Garner (pace Chambers), who says \"this grammatical error is committed almost exclusively by educated speakers trying a little too hard to sound refined but stumbling badly\", and says the phrase is \"appallingly common\". The notion that educated people are prone to this error is shared by Grammar Girl, who says that Jessica Simpson can therefore be forgiven (for the 2006 song \"Between You and I\"). According to legal scholar Patricia J. Williams, however, members of \"the real upper class\" recognize it immediately as substandard; she comments that such usage easily marks one as belonging to a lower class. Sociolinguist Gerard van Herk discusses \"between you and I\" and similar phrases with pronoun errors (which are all incorrect according to prescriptive linguists) in the context of social mobility."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Henry Hitchings"]}, {"page": "Somerset Maugham Award", "response": ["* Henry Hitchings for The Secret Life of Words"]}, {"page": "Fences (play)", "response": ["In 2013, the play was revived again in the UK by Theatre Royal Bath, starring Lenny Henry as Troy Maxson and directed by Paulette Randall.
