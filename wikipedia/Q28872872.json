Phyllis Francis led off taking an early lead, making up the 3-turn stagger distance and passing both teams, Canada and Ukraine to her outside early into the final turn.  Poland's lone fresh athlete Iga Baumgart-Witan and Jamaica's Anastasia Le-Roy held relatively close to the stagger, passing just three step and five steps behind.  GBR's Zoey Clark and Belgium's Hanne Claes kept them in the mix after one leg.  Second leg for USA was their young hurdling star Sydney McLaughlin.  She was so far ahead at the break, there was no need for strategic maneuvering, and she ran a perfect tangent from lane 7 to the beginning of the far turn taking a 5 metre lead on Patrycja Wyciszkiewicz with Britain's Jodie Williams close behind.  McLaughlin built up a 9 metre lead by her handoff to the hurdle world record holder Dalilah Muhammad, who true to form from her hurdle race, took off hard, expanding the gap to 15 metres through the first turn.  It was almost 20 metres over Poland's Ma\u0142gorzata Ho\u0142ub-Kowalik by the handoff, which behind her, Jamaica's Stephenie Ann McPherson was able to pull back lost ground against Britain's fresh Emily Diamond.  On anchor USA put 400 meter 4th place Wadeline Jonathas, Jamaica had their rested bronze medalist Shericka Jackson while Poland also had their best finalist, 7th place Justyna \u015awi\u0119ty-Ersetic, but with that lead, the battle was for silver.  Tightening the gap through the turn, Jackson ran by GBR's Laviai Nielsen and \u015awi\u0119ty-Ersetic on the backstretch.  With Jonathas long gone over 20 metres ahead, \u015awi\u0119ty-Ersetic stayed on Jackson's shoulder through the final turn then pulled into lane 2 for running room.  She couldn't sprint by Jackson, but \u015awi\u0119ty-Ersetic slowly narrowed the gap.  Just before Jonathas crossed the finish line, \u015awi\u0119ty-Ersetic edged back ahead.  Unable to respond, Jackson gave up the fight and eased across the finish line with bronze 3 metres behind.", "| 3 || 2 || 3 || align=left| || align=left|Zoey Clark, Jodie Williams, Jessica Turner, Laviai Nielsen || 3:24.99 || Q, ", "| 4 || 5 || align=left| || align=left|Zoey Clark, Jodie Williams, Emily Diamond, Laviai Nielsen  || 3:23.02 || "]}]}}
