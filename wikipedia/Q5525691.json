After broadcast, Thames commissioned a full series to be shown the following year, under the name The Bill as the show had the potential to appeal to a mass audience. Although The Bill is clearly a continuation from this episode, the main series contradicts it in a number of ways. For instance, in Woodentop Litten has completed his secondment to CID and is close to securing his place in the detective branch, whereas in The Bill he does not gain his CID secondment until halfway through Series One. In addition many central characters in \"Woodentop\" - such as Sergeant Wilding and Inspector Deeping - vanish between the pilot and the series.  Deeping does gain one mention in Series One, in the episode \"It's Not Such a Bad Job After All\", where Ackland is informed that he is coming to meet her on the scene of a suicide - a later radio transmission, however, reports that Sgt. Bob Cryer is to meet her instead.  Although Wilding is not mentioned following Woodentop, he shares several characteristics with Sgt. Cryer - including a position as the \"father figure\" of the Sun Hill relief, and an apparently tumultuous relationship with Roy Galloway, whom both Cryer and Wilding refer to as a \"bloody superstar\".  In the first episode of Series One, \"Funny Ol' Business - Cops and Robbers\", Galloway and Cryer make apparent reference to the events of Woodentop in regards to Jim Carver.  Galloway suggests that it is Cryer who requested the favour, further suggesting that Cryer and Wilding are in fact the one character, and that, like PC Taffy Morgan (later Taffy Edwards), Jack Wilding's name has merely been changed to Bob Cryer. There are also discrepancies with the naming of some of the characters. In the 2003 live episode of The Bill, made to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of broadcast, Carver and Ackland discuss events from the pilot, whereupon Carver incorrectly refers to the character of Taffy by the surname Morgan, a name that was dropped for the series proper in favour of \"Edwards\". There are also mistakes made in some of the uniforms the cast wore during the episode, for example, in one scene, PC Dave Litten is on foot patrol with PC Jim Carver, and PC Litten's helmet has GR on the helmet badge where it should have had ER, the same that was on PC Carver's helmet. Also the tunics the male officers wore had buttoned down epaulettes, whereas they should have just had the insignia placed on the shoulder of the tunic as this is what the Metropolitan Police wore at the time.  Only four of the cast of \"Woodentop\" would go on to be regulars in the main series of The Bill: Mark Wingett, Trudie Goodwin, Gary Olsen and Colin Blumenau, while a number of characters were re-cast, including Roy Galloway.Colin Blumenau", "* PC Dave Litten - Gary Olsen"]}, {"page": "Shaggy Dog Story (TV)", "response": ["*Gary Olsen (as Ben Porter from 2 point 4 Children)"]}, {"page": "Mo Hayder", "response": ["After (in her own words) \"a wild child phase\" and a brief marriage to Gary Olsen she emigrated at 25 to Japan where she became a teacher of English as a foreign language in Tokyo.
