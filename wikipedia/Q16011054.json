In 1989, Idle co-wrote and sang the theme tune to the popular British sitcom One Foot in the Grave and although the series became immensely popular, the song did poorly in the charts. However, when \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" was adopted as a football chant in the late 1980s, Idle's then neighbour Gary Lineker suggested Idle re-record and release the popular track. With help from Radio 1 breakfast show host Simon Mayo, who gave the song regular airplay and also used the chorus within a jingle, it became a hit, some 12 years after the song's original appearance in Life of Brian, reaching number 3 in the UK charts and landing Idle a set on Top of the Pops in October 1991. The following month Idle, accompanied by opera singer Ann Howard, sang the song at the Royal Variety Performance. He recorded a special version for Mayo's own use on air (\"Come on Simon, get another song on now; why don't you put on a nice Cliff Richard record?\") and changed the line \"life's a piece of shit\" to \"life's a piece of spit\" in order to get daytime airplay on radio. Idle presented Mayo with a model human foot, akin to the one used in the Monty Python title sequence, as a thank you gift for promoting the song."]}, {"page": "The Arcadians (musical)", "response": ["In 1968 most of the score was recorded in stereo by EMI, with Vil\u00e9m Tausk\u00fd conducting a cast headed by June Bronhill, Ann Howard, Michael Burgess and Jon Pertwee.
