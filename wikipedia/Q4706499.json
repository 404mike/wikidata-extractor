Marsh once told Wogan on air that his wife was called Janet, and a series of \"Janet and John\" stories followed, read by Wogan during the breakfast show. These were a pastiche of children's learn-to-read stories, with humorous sexual double-entendres, which often led to Wogan and Marsh breaking into laughter. Six CDs and two books of the stories have been sold in aid of Children in Need, raising over \u00a34 million. A long-running campaign by Wogan criticising the British government for levying VAT on the CDs eventually led to a government rebate of \u00a3200,000. Another feature of the programme was Wogan's exchanges with \"the Totty from Splotty\" \u2013 Lynn Bowles, the Welsh traffic reporter from Splott, Cardiff \u2013 which often involved reading limericks from listeners cut short after one or two lines, as risqu\u00e9 innuendo in the later lines was telegraphed."]}, {"page": "BBC Radio WM", "response": ["* Alan Dedicoat (1979-1985)"]}, {"page": "Hollywood, Worcestershire", "response": ["*Alan Dedicoat, former presenter at BBC Radio WM and now 'Voice of the Balls' on The National Lottery Draws, born in the village."]}, {"page": "Strictly Come Dancing", "response": ["The show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (with Zoe Ball covering for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show. For some of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge Britain's Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her. Bussell remained a judge alongside Goodman, Tonioli and Horwood until 2018. Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday."]}, {"page": "King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys", "response": ["* Alan Dedicoat, BBC announcer and newsreader"]}, {"page": "Ken Bruce", "response": ["Bruce holds a PCV (Passenger Carrying Vehicle) driving licence and is the co-owner of a number of AEC Routemaster buses with Charles Nove, Alan Dedicoat and Steve Madden.
