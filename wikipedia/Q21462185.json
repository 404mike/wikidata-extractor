The AMC is credited with having facilitated the assimilation of the Indian subcontinent's artistic traditions into mainstream British culture. Founded by Indian writer and former political activist Ayana Angadi and his English wife, Patricia Fell-Clarke, a painter and later a novelist, the organisation was run from their family home in the north London suburb of Finchley.", "Late in 1939, Angadi met Patricia Fell-Clarke at a social event held at London's Dorchester Hotel. The daughter of a wealthy English industrialist, Patricia had similarly rejected societal norms, finding her identity as a portrait painter. Despite strong objections from her family and peers, the couple were married on Labour Day 1943.Massey, pp. 58\u201359. Patricia would draw inspiration from this disapproval during her later career as a successful novelist, beginning with 1985's The Governess."]}]}}
