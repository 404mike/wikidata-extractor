He achieved this feat at the age of 37 years and 254 days.He was born in Charing Cross, London and died in Lambeth, London.\nGunn took up boxing at the Surrey Commercial Docks Boxing Club in 1893 after joining his father's East End tailoring business.  He was British amateur champion from 1894 to 1896. He was so much better than his rivals at the time that authorities asked him to retire after he won his third Amateur Boxing Association (ABA) title. Gunn did so, but in 1908, having served on the ABA council for more than ten years, he returned to win the Olympic title before hanging up his gloves for good. Gunn died in London aged 90, having only lost one fight in fifteen years.", "link_mentions": {}}}
