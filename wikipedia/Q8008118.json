They are probably excerpts of the Progressive lessons for the harpsichord and piano forte, published in 1778 (or 1785).\nDuncombe is frequently confused with the writer William Duncombe (1690 \u2013 1769).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Duncombe (disambiguation)", "response": ["William Duncombe (1690\u20131769) was a British author and playwright.", "William Duncombe may also refer to:", "*Sir William Duncombe, 2nd Baronet (1658\u20131706), of the Duncombe baronets", "*William Duncombe (composer) (c.1736-1738\u20131818/19), English composer", "*William Duncombe, 2nd Baron Feversham (1798\u20131867), British landowner and politician", "*William Duncombe, 1st Earl of Feversham (1829\u20131915), British politician", "*William Duncombe, Viscount Helmsley (1852\u20131881), British politician"]}]}}
