Their May 2002 report \"Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001\", written by Chris Allen and Jorgen S. Nielsen of the University of Birmingham, was based on 75 reports\u00a0 \u2013 15 from each EU member nation.Allen, Chris and Nielsen, Jorgen S. \"Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001\" , EUMC, May 2002. The report highlighted the regularity with which ordinary Muslims became targets for abusive and sometimes violent retaliatory attacks after 9/11. Despite localized differences within each member nation, the recurrence of attacks on recognizable and visible traits of Islam and Muslims was the report's most significant finding. Incidents consisted of verbal abuse, blaming all Muslims for terrorism, forcibly removing women's hijabs, spitting on Muslims, calling children \"Osama\", and random assaults. A number of Muslims were hospitalized and in one instance paralyzed. The report also discussed the portrayal of Muslims in the media. Inherent negativity, stereotypical images, fantastical representations, and exaggerated caricatures were all identified. The report concluded that \"a greater receptivity towards anti-Muslim and other xenophobic ideas and sentiments has, and may well continue, to become more tolerated.\"", "The classification of \"closed\" and \"open\" views set out in the Runnymede report has been criticized as an oversimplification of a complex issue by scholars like Chris Allen, Fred Halliday, and Kenan Malik. Paul Jackson, in a critical study of the anti-Islamic English Defence League, argues that the criteria put forward by the Runnymede report for Islamophobia \"can allow for any criticism of Muslim societies to be dismissed...\". He argues that both jihadi Islamists and far-right activists use the term \"to deflect attention away from more nuanced discussions on the make-up of Muslim communities\", feeding \"a language of polarised polemics\". On one hand, it can be used \"to close down discussion on genuine areas of criticism\" regarding jihadi ideologies, which in turn has resulted in all accusations of Islamophobia to be dismissed as \"spurious\" by far-right activists. Consequently, the term is \"losing much [of its] analytical value\"."]}, {"page": "Chris Allen", "response": ["Chris Allen may refer to:", "*Chris Allen (academic) (born 1966), British sociologist", "*Chris Allen (footballer, born 1972), English football player", "*Chris Allen (footballer, born 1989), English football player ", "*Chris Allen (ice hockey) (born 1978), Canadian ice hockey defenceman", "*Chris Allen (skier) (born 1959), Australian Olympic skier", "*Chris Allen (author) (born 1964), Australian author", "* Chris Allen (born 1952), vocalist with The Troggs", "*Chris Allen, founding member of the band Shadowkeep"]}, {"page": "Tell MAMA", "response": ["Government advisor and academic expert on Islamophobia, Dr Chris Allen, suggested that there was likely to be significant under-reporting of anti-Muslim incidents, based on a large 2009 EU-wide survey.
