In addition to inspecting the forces and raising morale, Sikorski was also occupied with political matters; around that time, a conflict was growing between him and General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders, as Sikorski was still open to some normalization of Polish\u2013Soviet relations, to which Anders was vehemently opposed. On 4 July 1943, while Sikorski was returning from an inspection of Polish forces deployed in the Middle East, he was killed, together with his daughter, his Chief of Staff, Tadeusz Klimecki, and seven others, when his plane, a Liberator II, serial AL523, crashed into the sea 16 seconds after takeoff from Gibraltar Airport at 23:07 hours. The crash was attributed to cargo on the plane shifting to the back upon takeoff. Only the pilot, Eduard Prchal (1911\u20131984), survived the crash. Sikorski was subsequently buried in a brick-lined grave at the Polish War Cemetery in Newark-on-Trent, England on 16 July that year. Winston Churchill delivered a eulogy at his funeral. On 14 September 1993, his remains were exhumed and transferred via Polish Air Force TU-154M, and escorted by RAF 56 Sqn Tornado F3 jets, to the royal crypts at Wawel Castle in Krak\u00f3w, Poland."]}, {"page": "Victor Cazalet", "response": ["The plane, a B-24 Liberator II LB-30 AL523 was also carrying General Sikorski and fellow Conservative MP Brigadier John Whiteley; Sikorski, Whiteley and everyone else on board (except for first pilot Eduard Prchal)\u2014sixteen in all\u2014died in the crash.

I pulled the stick back and the aircraft started to climb. When I was at 150ft I pushed the controls of the aircraft forward to gain speed. Suddenly I discovered I was not able to pull the stick back. The steering mechanism was jammed or locked.\" The aircraft then lost height rapidly.

The aircraft crashed into the sea.", "The only survivor of the accident was the pilot Flight Lieutenant Eduard Prchal, one of six crew on the aircraft. Among the 11 passengers killed were:", "In 2012, Jerzy Zi\u0119borak revisited the evidence gathered by the Court of Inquiry in 1943 as well as other material that has been made available to date. His conclusion was that the accident resulted from the combination of factors. Firstly, the aircraft was overloaded and its centre of gravity was displaced beyond the permissible limit. Secondly, the aircraft speed at take-off was too low due to the excessive weight. Finally, the autopilot was switched on just after the take-off \u2013 contrary to the flight manual \u2013 and that caused an effect similar to the controls' jamming as seen by the second pilot. Evidence has been found that the surviving pilot Eduard Prchal did perform the second pilot's duties during the take-off, which he did not reveal at the time of the investigation. Zi\u0119borak rejects General N\u00f6el Mason-MacFarlane's opinion that Prchal's mental state during the take-off was the reason for the accident. He then compares Prchal's article written ten years after the accident with the relevant documents from the accident. Not only did Prchal write an untrue description of the accident, but he omitted some details he had earlier mentioned during his meetings with pilots. The differences included details of his injuries mentioned in the article and those reported in the medical examination after the accident. The author considered whether it was possible that Prchal had completely forgotten such details of the accident as for example the number of victims. The reason for these differences, i.e. whether Prchal lied deliberately in his article or suffered from a type of partial amnesia as a result of his injury is not discussed. However, Zi\u0119borak thinks that Prchal lied on purpose about the Mae West lifejacket. Despite the deficiencies of the report, the results of the Court's investigations were finally accepted. The author concluded that this was a convenient solution for both the British and Polish government, as the details of VIPs' flight procedure could not be published in the Court's report during the war.", "Eduard Prchal himself was an average pilot, and in particular he was not an experienced pilot of heavy transport machines. He was a fighter pilot first and began training on the Liberator only on 22 December 1942.  At the time of the accident, he had 292 hours and 10 minutes of flight time with this aircraft type. Co-pilot Stanley Herring, although an experienced bomber pilot, had no experience in solo piloting the Liberator. Liberator aircraft were difficult to fly and did not tolerate errors, which resulted in a high accident rate during training. In addition, aircraft of the first two Liberator production series AL and AM had individual quirks in flight. Prchal and Herring did not know their aircraft AL523 well, and had previously made only one daytime take-off and flight on it. Prchal himself was not Sikorski's personal pilot.  Sikorski had flown with him for the first time from England to Cairo, and expressed a wish that Prchal would pilot his aircraft on the way back as well. As a result, Prchal was assigned to Liberator AL523, scheduled for the return trip. Sikorski planned to use his trust in the Czechoslovak pilot for propaganda, to improve harsh relations between the Polish and Czechoslovakian governments in exile. After taking off too early, the aircraft started to lose height, and Prchal may have had an impression of jammed elevators due to a gust of wind. The aircraft then came to a stall and crashed within twelve seconds of take-off. In conclusion, the accident, according to M. R\u00f3\u017cycki, was a simple disaster caused by taking off in unfavorable weather, from a too-short airstrip, and with an overloaded aircraft - with the Liberator's flight characteristics, the increased difficulty of night take-off, limited pilot experience and lack of knowledge of this particular aircraft's characteristics as contributing factors."]}, {"page": "W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski's death controversy", "response": ["The only survivor of the accident was the pilot Flight Lieutenant Eduard Prchal, one of six crew on the aircraft. The 11 passengers killed were:", "Another controversy surrounds the sole survivor of the flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who did not wish to tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket\u2014but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory\u2014essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely under the control of the second pilot, who died in the crash.", "In 1968, the play Soldaten.

The play partially drew on the work of David Irving and contained the sensational allegation that Winston Churchill had been in on the plot. In Hochhuth's play, Sikorski and other passengers were murdered by axe-wielding British commandos.
