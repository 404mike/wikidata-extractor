Despite being born in Kingston, Jamaica, he represented England at under-21 level. His nephew is the former Oldham Athletic defender Reuben Hazell, and his son Rohan is a non-League player.A big physical defender, he began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, featuring in the FA Youth Cup final in 1976. He moved on to Queens Park Rangers in 1979. He helped QPR to the Second Division title in 1982\u201383, and also played in the 1982 FA Cup Final. He moved on to Leicester City in 1983, and had a brief spell back on loan at Wolves in 1985, before he signed with Reading. He joined Port Vale in December 1986, and was a regular for the \"Valiants\" until a back injury forced his retirement in June 1989.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["Major signings for the start of the 1986\u201387 season were Mark Grew and Ray Walker (\u00a312,000 from Aston Villa), who would feature heavily for the club in the coming years, as well as Paul Smith. Smith was purchased for \u00a310,000 from Sheffield United and was sold for four times that figure to Lincoln City just over a year later. The club finished mid-table, twelve points above the drop. The winter signing of veteran Bob Hazell helped to shore up the Vale's defence. At the end of the season, Bill Bell was made the club's chairman. Also Darren Beckford was signed from Manchester City for \u00a315,000. He would become the club's top scorer for the next four seasons."]}, {"page": "1982 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The first game was a tense and largely dull game of few clear cut chances. QPR's young goalkeeper Peter Hucker was certainly the busier keeper although Spurs were mainly being kept to long range efforts. Hucker's performance in the first match would ultimately earn him the Man of the Match award. QPR were not outclassed however, although their attacking options were hindered when prolific striker Clive Allen, who had scored the winner in the semi-final, was injured early in the game and was a peripheral figure thereafter. He was replaced by Gary Micklewhite five minutes into the second half. Ninety minutes came and went with the score 0\u20130. With ten minutes of extra time remaining, Glenn Hoddle found himself just outside the QPR penalty box. His shot took a deflection (off Tony Currie) and found the right-hand corner of Hucker's goal. Not to be outdone, five minutes later Simon Stainrod took a long throw ten yards from the Spurs goal line. Rangers' burly centre-back Bob Hazell, flicked the ball on at the near post and Terry Fenwick headed the ball past Spurs keeper Ray Clemence at point-blank range, making the final score 1\u20131.", "|CB ||5 || Bob Hazell", "|CB ||5 || Bob Hazell"]}, {"page": "1978 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Arsenal entered the 1977\u201378 FA Cup in the third round where they faced Second Division team Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.  Four goals in a ten-minute spell in the first half, from David O'Leary, Malcolm Macdonald (2) and Frank Stapleton, effectively ended the match as a contest.  United had missed a penalty after O'Leary's opener and conceded a fifth to Stapleton in the second half, as Arsenal proceeded to the fourth round with a 5\u20130 victory.  Wolverhampton Wanderers were Arsenal's fourth round opponents at Highbury.  In front of a crowd of nearly 50,000, Wolves made the better start but Alan Sunderland's header from a Macdonald cross gave Arsenal a lead against the run of play.  Kenny Hibbitt equalised but the game was decided in the final minutes when Wolves' defender Bob Hazell was sent off; Macdonald scored the winner seconds later.  The fifth round saw Arsenal drawn at home against Walsall, against whom, in the 1932\u201333 FA Cup they had lost 2\u20130 in what is regarded as one of the greatest FA Cup upsets in the history of the competition.  The upset was not repeated as Arsenal won 4\u20131 with goals from Stapleton (2), Macdonald and Sunderland; Alan Buckley scored the consolation for Walsall."]}, {"page": "Simon Mills (footballer)", "response": ["Unable to fit him into the side due to the form of Ray Walker and others, Rudge converted Mills from a midfielder to a right-back. He made 19 Third Division appearances in 1987\u201388, scoring five goals. He played 55 games in 1988\u201389, playing in partnership first with fellow centre-backs Phil Sproson and Bob Hazell (who both struggled with injuries) and later Gary West and Dean Glover (who were signed mid-season), alongside full-backs Alan Webb and Darren Hughes, in front of goalkeeper Mark Grew. This proved to be the most successful defence in the division, conceding just 48 goals in 46 league games. However a third-place finish meant that they had to overcome Bristol Rovers 2\u20131 over two legs in the play-off final, with Robbie Earle hitting both goals. Mills missed just one Second Division game in 1989\u201390, forming a formidable defensive partnership with Glover. He played 45 games in 1990\u201391, as Vale retained their second tier status. He played 40 games in the 1991\u201392 relegation season, scoring twice, and helped the club to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. However, in autumn 1992 he developed knee trouble and underwent a series of unsuccessful operations, limiting him to just three league appearances in 1992\u201393. He was given a free transfer in May 1994. After retiring as a professional, he later attempted a comeback with Northern Premier League Premier Division sides Boston United and Matlock Town."]}, {"page": "Dean Glover", "response": ["Glover was signed by John Rudge in February 1989 for a then-club record \u00a3200,000 fee; Rudge intended him to be a replacement for injured defenders Phil Sproson and Bob Hazell. He became an instant hit with the Port Vale fans as he marked England international Steve Bull out of the game on his debut, a goalless draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He went on to play both legs of the play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers, as a Robbie Earle inspired Vale played their last game of Third Division football thanks to a 2\u20131 victory."]}, {"page": "List of people from Kingston, Jamaica", "response": ["* Bob Hazell, former footballer"]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["Rudge steadied the ship, slashing the wage bill by \u00a320,000. A young Robbie Earle began to show his promise, though it was veteran Alistair Brown who was the season's top scorer, with 21 strikes. A mid-table finish was acceptable considering the rebuilding effort Rudge made with the squad. In May 1985, young Welshman Andy Jones was purchased from Rhyl for \u00a33,000. He was soon joined by \u00a312,000 defender John Williams and numerous others. Vale were promoted back to the third tier in 1985\u201386, finishing in fourth place, losing just once at Vale Park. During the season, they went on an eighteen-match unbeaten run, building their record largely on a solid defence. Jones and Earle scored eighteen and seventeen goals respectively. The only downside was the finances, as a loss of \u00a379,474 was recorded, partly due to promotion bonus payouts. In the summer of 1986, new signings included Ipswich Town's reserve goalkeeper Mark Grew on a free, Aston Villa midfielder Ray Walker for \u00a312,000, Sheffield United winger Paul Smith for \u00a310,000 and Walsall striker Richard O'Kelly for \u00a36,000. Rudge also turned down the management position at Preston North End. He also made an attempt to bring a young Steve Bull to Vale Park. After an unconvincing start to 1986\u201387, Rudge sold John Williams to Bournemouth for \u00a330,000 and brought in Bob Hazell from Reading on a free. This helped transform the club's defence, while Andy Jones' fantastic record of 37 goals helped win the Vale a twelfth-place finish. The only worrying sign was a \u00a353,373 loss, increasing the club's debt to \u00a3363,878."]}, {"page": "Robert Joseph Hazell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Hazell"]}, {"page": "Robert Hazell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Hazell"]}, {"page": "Hazell", "response": ["*Bob Hazell (born 1959), British football player"]}]}}
