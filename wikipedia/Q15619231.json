His adolescence saw time spent both in Paris and Budapest before attending Balliol College at the University of Oxford, graduating with a degree in Modern History.  Upon graduating, Cheetham spent a year teaching English at a school in Valberg, Norway, to Tibetan refugees between the ages of 13 and 18.The Author, \"Publishing Profiles 14\", Autumn 1987."]}]}}
