It included the likes of Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby to add to the already attack minded Peter Ndlovu. The addition of Gary McAllister, following UEFA Euro 1996, should have provided mid-table stability but the team's defensive frailties often undermined Dublin's scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premier League history in May 1997. Despite having won away to Liverpool (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and at home to Chelsea in their previous two games, Coventry City went into the final day second from bottom of the table, needing not only to beat Tottenham Hotspur away from home but also for results elsewhere in the league to go their way for them to escape relegation. Goals from Dublin and Paul Williams gave Coventry a 2\u20131 win at White Hart Lane, while both Middlesbrough and Sunderland lost, and Coventry finished one point outside the relegation zone."]}, {"page": "Lee Carsley", "response": ["On 28 September 2015, Carsley was promoted to head coach of the first team following the departure of Marinus Dijkhuizen, with his former Derby County and Coventry City teammate Paul Williams promoted from logistics manager to assistant head coach.
