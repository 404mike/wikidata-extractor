He played for Chelsea and Southampton as a right-back, and made three appearances for England. He was the older brother of John Sillett, who managed Coventry City to FA Cup success in 1987.

Throughout its Southern League tenure Ashford had been a mid/lower table team. Their previous high point was 7th in 1963\u201364. But this was eclipsed by a fourth-placed finish under the managership of Peter Sillett in 1969\u201370 \u2013 a position that was rewarded with promotion to the Southern League Premier Division. This was a big step up for the club and represents their highest placing in the football pyramid. They were only one division below the Football League \u2013 indeed the 1969\u201370 Southern Premier champions, Cambridge United, had been elected to the Football League (there being no automatic promotion at this time).", "During the 1973\u201374 season long-time manager Peter Sillett moved to Folkestone and was replaced by Dennis Hunt who moved in the opposite direction. Dennis had been a member of the Gillingham team that defeated Ashford in the FA cup in 1960\u201361. He brought with him Trevor Pearce who five years earlier had been plucked form non-league football by Arsenal.", "A slump to 19th position in 1984\u201385 saw the two-year reign of Chris Weller as manager end with the re-appointment of Peter Sillett. The turnaround from 18th position in 1985\u201386 to League runners-up and promotion in 1986\u201387 was striking. The promotion was founded on a tight defensive unit who conceded only 32 goals \u2013 the fewest in any season by Ashford Town. Sillett was the first manager to pilot the club to promotion since he initially achieved the feat back in 1969\u201370 season. Assisting him in the role of trainer on both occasions was George Sargeant. The former Irish Cup winner had previously played for the Town, joining from Hastings in 1952 and fulfilled the 'man with the magic wet sponge' role since the 1960s and would continue for many more years yet!", "Following the 1986\u201387 promotion the club moved-up to the Southern Premier League \u2013 now sponsored by Beazer Homes. Manager Peter Sillett left for Poole Town immediately following the promotion and his assistant Nicky Sparks took up the reins for the following two seasons now playing at Folkestone. The 1989\u201390 season saw the team return to Ashford with the opening of the newly built Homelands facility. The stadium boasted a capacity of 3,300 with 500 seated. But it wasn't an auspicious inaugural season \u2013 the team, managed by former incumbent Chris Weller (Nicky Sparks had joined his former boss Peter Sillett now at Hastings), finished 19th of 22 teams and were relegated back to the Southern Division."]}, {"page": "Ted Drake", "response": ["Without much ado he was appointed manager of First Division Chelsea in June 1952. This is so due to the rivalry between the Gunners and the Blues being non existent at the time. Upon Drake's arrival at Chelsea, he made a series of sweeping changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous amateurish, music hall image. He discarded the club's Chelsea pensioner crest and with it the Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new one be adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club's previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable players.
