Junior Lewis was employed as first team coach, working with assistant manager Wayne Jacobs and youth team coach David Wetherall. Taylor signed a one-year contract at Bradford the day before Bradford played Northampton. In January 2011, Taylor turned down an offer from Premier League Newcastle United to be assistant to their new manager Alan Pardew. After three successive defeats later in the month, Taylor came under pressure but vowed to carry on, saying: \"I'm not a fool, I can tell that I'm probably not the most popular manager Bradford City's ever had. I'm not prepared to walk away, I'm prepared to take this difficult job head on.\" City's run of poor form continued and the following month, Taylor and City parted company by mutual consent; although the announcement came before City's game with Stockport County, Taylor remained in charge for one final time."]}, {"page": "Darren Moore", "response": ["Moore was a pivotal figure in the 2006\u201307 Derby side that clinched promotion back to the Premier League after a five-year absence by winning the Championship play-off final 1\u20130 against his former club West Brom. This was the fourth time he had been part of a squad which won promotion to the Premier League, following on from his successes at West Brom (twice) and Bradford. His form that year led to him being named in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2006\u201307 Championship. In the 2007\u201308 Premiership season, Derby were relegated as the bottom club, although Moore was awarded the club's internal Player of the Season award. Following the club's relegation, manager Paul Jewell allowed Moore to talk to his former club Bradford City, who were managed by his former teammates Stuart McCall and Wayne Jacobs as assistant. However, Bradford City decided not to pursue their interest in Moore, instead opting to sign Graeme Lee."]}, {"page": "David Wetherall", "response": ["Wetherall was one of four senior players to act as Bradford City manager for two weeks during November 2003, following the sacking of Nicky Law. He, as well as Peter Atherton, Wayne Jacobs and Dean Windass oversaw training but just one game when Bradford City lost 1\u20130 to Stoke City with Jacobs taking charge from the touchline. Wetherall took his first full steps into management on a caretaker basis when he was appointed player-manager at Bradford City following the sacking of Colin Todd on 12 February 2007. The side were on a poor run of form but Wetherall, whose role was extended in March, could not reverse the fortunes and the side were relegated to League Two. During Wetherall's short stint in charge the club won just two games and drew another four. During his spell in charge of Bradford, Wetherall appointed his former Leeds teammate Nigel Martyn as goalkeeping coach, a position he kept under McCall. Wetherall returned to concentrate on his playing career after Stuart McCall was named full-time manager during the summer of 2007."]}, {"page": "Peter Atherton (footballer)", "response": ["In June 2007, Atherton was appointed assistant manager of Halifax Town, replacing Wayne Jacobs.
