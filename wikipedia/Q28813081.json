Lamb selected the site of Kusura, conducting a trial excavation in 1935 with Elinor W. Gardner and full excavations in 1936 and 1937 with James Rivers Barrington Stewart, Eleanor Mary Barrington Stewart, Rachel Maxwell-Hyslop, R.H. Macartney, and Nine Six; as well as excavating the cemetery, finds included a cult site and pottery relating to Troy VI. Lamb presented her findings in a lecture to the Society of Antiquaries in London on 'Recent developments in the prehistory of Anatolia' in 1937, pointing out Kusura's location on a major Bronze Age route between central Anatolia and the Aegean. A second lecture to the Society of Antiquaries in 1938 similarly emphasized Kusura's relationships with both of these areas. Lamb also published the Anatolian material held by the Fitzwilliam Museum. She felt that more excavation was required in Anatolia, but her work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II."]}, {"page": "Hilda Lorimer", "response": ["She was a skilled Latin linguist, but at Oxford her interests turned toward archaeology. She took a sabbatical to attend the British School at Athens in 1901 and 1902.

In 1911, she participated in excavations at Phylakopi on Melos. Dorothy Lamb, Lillian Tenant and  Lorimer were the first women to participate in an excavation conducted by the British School at Athens. The excavation, led by Richard MacGillivray Dawkins, the director of the British School, was conducted from March to May 1911. The project was a supplementary excavation of a site that had been explored from 1896 to 1899."]}]}}
