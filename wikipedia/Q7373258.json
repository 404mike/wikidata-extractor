His works have been likened to those of John Constable, Edward Seago, and Campbell Mellon, British painters whose styles were influenced by the Barbizon school and Impressionism.\nBeginning life in a children's home, he became one of the first artists to open an art gallery in Cork Street, a prestigious street lined with art galleries in London's Mayfair. His works are popularly collected by British royalty, including Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grantham", "response": ["*Roy Petley (born 1951), Grantham-born plein air painter"]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Roy Petley (born 1951)"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"P\"", "response": ["*Roy Petley (born 1951), English painter"]}, {"page": "Petley", "response": ["*Roy Petley (born 1950), British painter."]}, {"page": "Petleys", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roy Petley#Petleys"]}]}}
