The name \"Osbert\" has been used by members of the Mordaunt family since the 12th century, in honour of a direct ancestor of that name.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage 2003, volume 2, pg 2771 Mordaunt was educated at Eton College, where he played for the college cricket eleven. From Eton he went up to Christ Church, Oxford. While at Oxford he was a member of the Oxford University Cricket Club, but did not play first-class cricket for the club. However, while at Oxford he did play first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1866 against Oxford at Lord's. He batted twice in the match and made scores of 6 and 5, being dismissed by Stirling Voules and Edward Kenney respectively. He played below first class level for the counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire and (in one match in 1867) for Shropshire. He was described in Scores and Biographies as a \"capital hitter and a good field, generally at point or slip. He developed into a good lob-bowler, delivering with either hand, and was also a very sound judge of the game\"."]}]}}
