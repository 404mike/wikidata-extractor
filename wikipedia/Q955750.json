He found particular fault with Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket, and accused Whistler of asking two hundred guineas for \"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\".Linda Merrill, A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin. \u2013 book review, Art in America, January 1993, by Wendy Steiner  Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin, but Ruskin was ill when the case went to trial in November 1887, so the artist Edward Burne-Jones and Attorney General Sir John Holker represented him. The trial took place on 25 and 26 November, and many major figures of the art world at the time appeared at the trial. Artist Albert Moore appeared as a witness for Whistler, and artist William Powell Frith appeared for Ruskin. Frith said \"the nocturne in black in gold is not in my opinion worth two hundred guineas\". Frederic Leighton also agreed to give evidence for Whistler, but in the end could not attend as he had to go to Windsor to be knighted. Edward Burne-Jones, representing Ruskin, also asserted that Nocturne in Black and Gold was not a serious work of art. When asked to give reasons, Burne-Jones said he had never seen one painting of night that was successful, but also acknowledged that he saw marks of great labour and artistic skill in the painting. In the end, Whistler won the case, but the jury awarded damages of only a derisory farthing (the smallest coin of the realm) to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription organised by the Fine Art Society, but Whistler was bankrupt within six months, and was forced to sell his studio. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, and may have accelerated his mental decline.For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, \"Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity\" in Nineteenth-Century Prose, vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13\u201334.
