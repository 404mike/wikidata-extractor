The duo's first season in charge of Derby saw the club finish one place lower, 18th, than the previous campaign but it saw the recruitment of numerous players, such Roy McFarland, John O'Hare and Alan Hinton, who between them made 1,154 appearances for the club and would go on to form the spine of the club's most successful ever side. Of the inherited squad, eleven players departed and only four were retained: Kevin Hector, Alan Durban, Ron Webster and Colin Boulton. Clough also fired the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a defeat. The season was notable for a run to the League Cup semi finals, the club's first ever notable run in the competition, where they lost 4\u20132 on aggregate to eventual winners Leeds United. The campaign also saw Reg Matthews set the club record of 246 appearances by a goalkeeper, as he surpassed Harry Maskrey's previous record of 222.", "Murphy lasted just 6 games into the 1977\u201378 season before being replaced by former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty. Docherty was constantly engaged in the transfer market whilst at Derby, but the only truly successful capture was Steve Buckley, a \u00a3163,000 signing from Luton Town who was Derbys first choice leftback for the next 8 years. In his two years in charge at Derby, Docherty could only oversee 12th placed and 19th placed finishes. During his spell, the backbone of Derby's glory era departed, as Colin Boulton, Colin Todd, Archie Gemmill, Kevin Hector Charlie George and Leighton James either retired or were sold and on and not adequately replaced, with Docherty's \"three Van Goghs\" midfield trio of Bruce Rioch, Gerry Daly and Don Masson flopped in particular.

He was on the bench for the first round of the UEFA Cup against Irish club Finn Harps in the 1976\u201377 season due to Colin Boulton being out on loan and Steve Bowtell being illegible. He represented the Midland Intermediate League, though had his reserve team opportunities limited until Boulton left the club. He was given his first professional contract in 1978, still with six months left to run of his apprenticeship contract. He was called up to the England Youth Team later in the year and won four caps: two playing against Las Palmas Select' team, one against the USSR and one against Italy.
