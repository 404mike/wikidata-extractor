His personal and sartorial peculiarities were copied by his friend Frederic Reynolds to enliven the characters in his comedies.The Life and Times of Frederic Reynolds, H. Colburn (1826) ii. 25\u201346 Meanwhile, Topham's talent as a writer of prologues and epilogues introduced him to the leading actors of the day, and led to his first appearance as a playwright. An epilogue, spoken by Charles Lee Lewes in imitation of a Moli\u00e8re character, filled Drury Lane for several nights. Another, on a recent tragedy, spoken by Miss Farren, was equally popular. He wrote an epilogue for the benefit of Mary Wells, and their friendship soon became intimacy. They lived together for several years, and four children resulted from the union.Memoirs of the life of Mrs. Sumbel, late Wells; of the Theatres-Royal, Drury-Lane, Covent-Garden, and Haymarket... C.

Topham contributed articles under the title of The Schools, in which he gave reminiscences of many of his companions at Eton, and his Life of the Late John Elwes (1790) made its first appearance in its columns. This memoir of the miser (sometimes credited with being the inspiration for Ebenezer Scrooge) passed through six editions during 1790, and in 1805 reached a twelfth edition, \"corrected and enlarged, and with a new appendix\". A German translation was published at Danzig in 1791. Horace Walpole considered it \"one of the most amusing anecdotal books in the English language\". It is said to have raised the sale of The World by a thousand copies a day; but an even better hit was made by the correspondence between the rival pugilists Richard Humphries and Daniel Mendoza.", "After five years Topham disposed of his paper, abandoned Mary Wells for someone else, and retired with his three surviving daughters to Wold Cottage, about two miles from Thwing, East Riding of Yorkshire.  It was rumoured that he intended to spend the rest of his days in farming some hundreds of acres of land and in writing the history of his own life. His kennels were considered the best in England, and his greyhound \"Snowball\" was praised as \"one of the best and fleetest greyhounds that ever ran\", and \"his breed all most excellent\".Alexander Mackintosh (d.1829), The Driffield Angler (1806, self-published?)
