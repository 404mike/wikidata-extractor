Under Steve Coppell, Hunt was put in the first team which gave Hunt his debut for the club until Coppell's unexpected resignation over his lack of passion for the job. Under Coppell's assistant manager Keith Millen, Hunt was given more playing time until Hunt fell out favour with Millen.

Millen favoured Carey and Jordan Spence at right back until he was sacked. At the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Millen was keen to offload him but received no offers for the player.
