In spring 1900, the Boxer movement spread rapidly north from Shandong into the countryside near Beijing. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. American Minister Edwin H. Conger cabled Washington, \"the whole country is swarming with hungry, discontented, hopeless idlers.\" On 30 May the diplomats, led by British Minister Claude Maxwell MacDonald, requested that foreign soldiers come to Beijing to defend the legations. The Chinese government reluctantly acquiesced, and the next day a multinational force of 435 navy troops from eight countries debarked from warships and travelled by train from Dagu (Taku) to Beijing. They set up defensive perimeters around their respective missions.", "The legations of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Russia and Japan were located in the Beijing Legation Quarter south of the Forbidden City. The Chinese army and Boxer irregulars besieged the Legation Quarter from 20 June to 14 August 1900. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers, marines and sailors from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge there. Under the command of the British minister to China, Claude Maxwell MacDonald, the legation staff and military guards defended the compound with small arms, three machine guns, and one old muzzle-loaded cannon, which was nicknamed the International Gun because the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells Russian and the crew American. Chinese Christians in the legations led the foreigners to the cannon and it proved important in the defence. Also under siege in Beijing was the Northern Cathedral (Beitang) of the Catholic Church. The Beitang was defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 Catholic foreign priests and nuns, and about 3,200 Chinese Catholics. The defenders suffered heavy casualties especially from lack of food and mines which the Chinese exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound. The number of Chinese soldiers and Boxers besieging the Legation Quarter and the Beitang is unknown.", "One newspaper called the aftermath of the siege a \"carnival of ancient loot\", and others called it \"an orgy of looting\" by soldiers, civilians and missionaries. These characterisations called to mind the sacking of the Summer Palace in 1860.James L. Hevia, \"Looting and Its Discontents: Moral Discourse and the Plunder of Beijing, 1900\u20131901\", in Bickers and Tiedemann, ed., The Boxers, China, and the World (2007): 94. Each nationality accused the others of being the worst looters. An American diplomat, Herbert G. Squiers, filled several railway carriages with loot and artifacts. The British Legation held loot auctions every afternoon and proclaimed, \"Looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly manner.\" However, one British officer noted, \"It is one of the unwritten laws of war that a city which does not surrender at the last and is taken by storm is looted.\" For the rest of 1900\u20131901, the British held loot auctions everyday except Sunday in front of the main-gate to the British Legation. Many foreigners, including Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald and Lady Ethel MacDonald and George Ernest Morrison of The Times, were active bidders among the crowd. Many of these looted items ended up in Europe. The Catholic Beitang or North Cathedral was a \"salesroom for stolen property.\"Chamberlin, Wilbur J. letter to his wife (11 December 1900), in Ordered to China: Letters of Wilbur J.

Myers was wounded in the leg by a spear; his attack was claimed by the British Consul, Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald, as \"one of the most successful operations of the siege, as it rendered our position on the wall, which had been precarious, comparatively strong.\" As a result of his bravery in this action, he was brevetted major and advanced four numbers in rank. In 1921, Myers would also become one of only 20 living marines to be awarded the USMC Brevet Medal when that decoration was created.
