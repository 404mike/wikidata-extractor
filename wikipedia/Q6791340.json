Being second favourites for the title, Wednesday were expected to come out with a comfortable win in their first game against Rochdale. In front of the home crowd at Hillsborough Stadium the game finished in a 2\u20130 win, after goals from captain Rob Jones from a corner-kick, and then a superb volley from outside the area by David Prutton, after the ball was cleared away from a corner. The goal is now up for contention for Sheffield Wednesday's goal of the season. Three days later, The Owls confirmed the signing of striker Chris O'Grady from Rochdale. It was rumoured before the previous game that O'Grady was soon to sign for Wednesday, and actually played his last game for Rochdale against Sheffield Wednesday when he came off the bench in the later stages of that game. Chris O'Grady signed on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. With Wednesday only having two first team forward's for their first game of the season, they desperately needed some attacking players. O'Grady made it three strikers at the club, and still needing more depth in that department, The Owls confirmed that Nigerian Danny Uchechi had signed on a six-month loan deal from fellow country team FC Dender. 21-year-old Uchechi had never made a first team professional appearance throughout his career, although having experience at several other English clubs, including Charlton Athletic, West Ham United and Leicester City. However, the next day Uchechi did make his first career appearance when The Owls were hosts to Blackpool in the Football League Cup. The game, which was live on ESPN, was made clear by manager Gary Megson of its unimportance to the club and its seasons expectations, with it possibly being a distraction in gaining promotion in the league. Megson therefore made several changes to the team's starting line-up including giving debuts to youngsters Cecil Nyoni, and Matthew Tumilty \u2013 who came off the bench. Blackpool being a league above The Owls were inevitably favourites, even though making several changes themselves. The match went without any goals throughout the full 90 minutes and extra time, even though Blackpool were reduced to ten men after Ashley Eastham was sent-off in the seventy-eighth minute. Wednesday went on to win 4\u20132 on penalties, after Blackpool missed their first two. Another signing for The Owls was made the same evening of the Blackpool game, this time in midfield with Chris Lines from Bristol Rovers on an undisclosed fee, and a contract lasting three-years. The end of a busy week for Wednesday was ended with their first away trip of the campaign, against AFC Bournemouth. Sheffield Wednesday continued their same away form as the end of the previous season \u2013 losing 2\u20130. Goals in each half from Adam Barrett and Harry Arter finished off The Owls. Wednesday were away again three days later in their first mid-week game of the season. An early goal from Ryan Lowe and a goal five minutes before half-time by Damien Mozika meant Bury led 2\u20130 at half-time. Although, Chris Sedgwick pulled a goal back for The Owls at the beginning of the second half, Wednesday could not grab another for a draw, the game ended 2\u20131 and meant a second consecutive loss for Sheffield Wednesday. Before the weekends game back at Hillsborough Stadium against Notts County, Wednesday confirmed the loan signing of winger Ben Marshall from Premier League club Stoke City. Marshall made his debut for Sheffield Wednesday in the 2\u20131 win against Notts County on the following Saturday. Jeff Hughes gave Notts County an early lead from the penalty spot on the tenth minute. It was not until the second half when Wednesday equalised through Julian Bennett, scoring his first goal for the club having joined in mid-July. Then Gary Madine got the winner fourteen-minutes later, giving The Owls two wins on the bounce at home. A second consecutive mid-week game saw Wednesday visit Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in the Football League Cup. Megson made several changes for the Football League Cup tie once again, and within the first seven-minutes The Owls were already 3\u20130 down. Although, Clinton Morrison did pull a goal back in the second half, the game finished 3\u20131, sending Wednesday out of the competition in the second round. The last league game in August saw Wednesday visit captain Rob Jones's former club, Scunthorpe United. With Scunthorpe United recently being relegated from the above division, it was expected to be the toughest opposition in the league yet. The game showed to be a close encounter, in front of a crowd of 16,862 at Hillsborough Stadium, the game finished 3\u20132 to The Owls. A double-brace from Gary Madine and a first goal in two appearances for Ben Marshall were the goal scorers for Wednesday, and Robert Grant and Mark Duffy both scoring for Scunthorpe United. On 30 August The Owls confirmed another loan signing, this time with defender David Kasnik being brought into the team from Slovenian side Olimpija Ljubljana for six months. The same day Sheffield Wednesday were to play live on Sky Sports in the Football League Trophy against Bradford City. Gary Megson's intentions for this competition were clear again, as just another unimportant fixture, of which was a distraction to the club. He gave a debut to youngster Ayo Obileye who became one of the youngest ever players to play for the club, at the age of 16 years and 363 days. The competition however states that a club has to start at least 'six first team players', so The Owls were unable to make as many changes as they would have liked, but instead three of their 'first team players' were subbed within the first seventeen minutes of the game. One player who did come on was Cecil Nyoni, who was given is second ever career appearance. The game finished goalless and went to penalties, with Bradford City going through 3\u20131 on penalties. Throughout that game there were many reports that Bury striker Ryan Lowe was in the later stages of signing for the club. It was confirmed after the game that he indeed had signed on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be around \u00a31million. The next day saw the last day of the transfer window, The Owls let go Giles Coke on loan to Bury for six months, and Mark Beevers on loan to Milton Keynes Dons.", "|25 || ||DF ||Matthew Tumilty || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["Pre-season for Sheffield Wednesday is due to kick-off at the beginning of July 2012.

This is after the club released two goalkeeper's and had yet to confirm if other goalkeeper's Stephen Bywater and Arron Jameson had re-signed with the club, their previous contracts had expired that summer. However a day after this it was confirmed that one of these goalkeeper's had signed a new two-year contract at the club. Wednesday Academy product Arron Jameson signed to make his stay at the club last up to six-years by 2014. Jameson had only ever made two appearances for the club, both against Milton Keynes Dons. On 28 May 2012 the Owls confirmed the highly expected capture of defender Kieran Lee on a free transfer and a three-year contract. The signing of Lee had been expected to be confirmed at any time within the last two weeks after an Oldham Athletic member of staff confirmed that they could not compete with a club of Sheffield Wednesday's position and stature. After confirming a pre-season friendly with Kilmarnock as a testimonial for James Fowler, Sheffield Wednesday signed another free-agent. Joe Mattock signed on a three-year-contract after his contract ran out at West Bromwich Albion. On 14 June 2012, 2012\u201313 Football League Cup draw was made and Wednesday found out which team they would play in their first competitive match of the season. The Owls were drawn away to Oldham Athletic, a team who the side will be familiar with after being in the same league as them the previous season. Later that same day Sheffield Wednesday revealed the game would be live on Sky Sports, and be a day earlier than the majority of the rest of the games in Round 1, on Monday 13 August. 4 days after the League Cup draw, the fixtures for the 2012\u201313 Football League Championship were announced.

The long anticipated signing of defender Anthony Gardner was made on 20 June 2012. The signing again was on a free transfer and the thirty-one-year-old signed on a two-year contract from Crystal Palace. It was however speculated that same morning that Gardner may not be signing for Wednesday after all, and that Dave Jones was getting impatient, with interest from Chinese clubs as well. However, just hours later the deal was done and the Owls made their fourth summer signing. The day after this Sheffield Wednesday completed another signing, this time in the forward position, with Chris Maguire signing on an undisclosed fee from Derby County on a three-year contract. With June coming to a close it was time for players who had been offered contracts to either agree terms or look to play elsewhere. Goalkeeper Stephen Bywater signed a new deal to keep him with the club for a further season, meaning a total of four potential first-team goalkeeper's were now at the club. Then two days later on 29 June, Sheffield Wednesday Academy product Mark Beevers signed a two-year deal which would see his Sheffield Wednesday professional career span to seven-years. On 6 July 2012, rumours became official of assistant manager Terry Burton joining Premier League side Arsenal to take on their Reserve and Head of Development Coach role.
