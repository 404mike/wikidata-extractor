Carroll and Evans were subsequently signed to the team and Panasonic was named as the team's main sponsor. Lear Corporation, who used to support Jaguar in their Formula One campaign, were announced as the secondary sponsor. In October 2016, Gorillaz guitarist Noodle became Jaguar's global ambassador, following a commercial that shows her driving in an electric open-wheeled car, before getting out and saying the experience could be improved.", "Evans and Piquet were retained for the 2018\u201319 season. Ho-Pin Tung was also retained in his position. In addition to his reserve driver duty, Tung also served as a pundit and was part of the Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy broadcast team. For the 2019 rookie test (which was once again held in Marrakesh following the ePrix), the team opted to bring back Pietro Fittipaldi and pair him with Harry Tincknell. In March 2019, just after the inaugural Sanya ePrix, Piquet left the team following a string of poor results (in contrast to Evans' string of points finishes) and was replaced by former Virgin driver Alex Lynn. Evans managed to win the following race in Rome, giving Jaguar their first win \u2013 this was also the team's first actual podium finish in the series. His teammate Lynn finished 12th on his Jaguar debut. Evans' car was subsequently sent to the FIA headquarters in Geneva for checks to analyse one of the wishbones and its compliance with the wishbone/arm element sealed at the homologation. No issues were found, thus the win became officially confirmed."]}, {"page": "Andy Priaulx", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Marino Franchitti Harry Tincknell", "|align=\"left\"|  Harry Tincknell Pipo Derani", "|align=\"left\"|  Harry Tincknell Tony Kanaan", "|align=\"left\"|  Jonathan Bomarito Harry Tincknell"]}]}}
