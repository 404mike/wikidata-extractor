Matthews as the butler's ranking boss, a beautifully addle-brained old codger, runs away with the show. Mr. Matthews' illustration of the complacence of an impoverished earl may not be wholly consistent but it glistens brightly in spots. David Tomlinson also does nicely as the thoroughly light-weight young lord and Lana Morris, Tom Macaulay and Marjorie Fielding are amusing in other roles.\""]}, {"page": "Second Thoughts (1938 film)", "response": ["* Marjorie Fielding as Mrs Gaunt"]}, {"page": "Portrait of Clare (film)", "response": ["* Marjorie Fielding as Aunt Cathie"]}, {"page": "The Net (1953 film)", "response": ["* Marjorie Fielding as Mother Heathley"]}, {"page": "Circle of Danger", "response": ["* Marjorie Fielding as Margaret McArran "]}, {"page": "Conspirator (1949 film)", "response": ["* Marjorie Fielding as Aunt Jessica "]}, {"page": "The Woman's Angle", "response": ["* Marjorie Fielding - Mrs. Mansell"]}, {"page": "Quiet Wedding (play)", "response": ["In 1941 a film adaptation Quiet Wedding was directed by Anthony Asquith, starring Margaret Lockwood, Derek Farr and Marjorie Fielding.
