Billy Hardy featured in more games than any other player, being ever present in both the league and FA Cup with 49 appearances. He missed only one senior match for the side, the club's Welsh Cup defeat. Forward Jimmy Gill, signed at the start of the season, was the club's top goalscorer. He scored 20 times in all competitions, finishing the campaign eight goals clear of the next highest scoring player, Arthur Cashmore. The club attracted an average home attendance at Ninian Park of more than 28,000 for their first season in the Football League, an increase from previous years in the Southern League. Home matches against Coventry City and Bristol City both recorded season-high league attendances of 42,000, although an FA Cup tie against Chelsea attracted 50,000.", "Cardiff were handed an away fixture in their first Football League match, facing Stewart's former club Stockport County. Considered underdogs against the more experienced side, Cardiff secured a 5\u20132 victory with two goals from new signing Gill and one each from Jack Evans, Billy Grimshaw and Keenor. The performance led The Times to describe the win as \"one of the best performances of the day\" in the Football League. The team's second match was the first Football League tie held at Ninian Park as 25,000 fans witnessed a goalless draw with Clapton Orient. The first home victory at the ground came in the team's following match, when they recorded a 3\u20130 win over Stockport in the reverse fixture, a week after their first meeting. At the time, the Football League used Charles Sutcliffe's fixture system that paired club's home and away matches against the same side on consecutive weekends or in close proximity wherever possible. The club's previous season's top goalscorer Arthur Cashmore opened the scoring, becoming the first player to score a Football League goal at Ninian Park, before Grimshaw added a brace. Cardiff suffered their first defeat in the Football League in the reverse fixture against Clapton Orient on 6 September, losing 2\u20130.", "! scope=row|Arthur Cashmore"]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Cardiff's next fixture was against unbeaten league leaders Middlesbrough in a match that was described in The Times as \"the most noteworthy example of disparity of strength between contesting clubs\". In a surprising turn of form given the club's league form, Cardiff recorded their first victory in the First Division after causing an upset to win 3\u20131 and sceure two points. Jimmy Gill, who had been the club's top scorer the previous season, scored his first goals of the campaign with a brace and Harry Nash added a third. The victory prompted an upturn in fortune for the team as they lost only one of their five matches in October, a 2\u20131 defeat to Bolton Wanderers. Gill enjoyed a fine run of form during this time, scoring six goals in the five matches including braces during victories over West Bromwich Albion and Bolton in the reverse fixture. With the club struggling for goals, October also saw the arrival of Joe Clennell from Everton for \u00a31,500 (approximately \u00a375,000 in 2020). In an attempt to recoup some of the transfer fee, two forwards who had played an integral role in promotion in the 1920\u201321 season, Arthur Cashmore and Fred Pagnam, were sold having failed to score in a combined 17 appearances. The club also signed Jimmy Nelson from Irish side Crusaders for \u00a3500 (approximately \u00a325,000 in 2020).
