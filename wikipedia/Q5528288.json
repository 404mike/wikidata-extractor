He was a versatile player who could play as a striker, on both left and right wings and attacking midfield.\nA former Gillingham youth team player, he played non-league football for Ashford Town (Kent), Aylesbury United, Staines Town, St Albans City, Yeading and Windsor & Eton, before having a brief spell in the English Football League with Brentford in 2006. He returned to the non-league scene with Fisher Athletic, before winning a contract at Yeovil Town in June 2008. Two years later he switched to Dagenham & Redbridge, but was not a success at his new club, and was loaned out to Torquay United and Gillingham. He signed with Southend United in July 2012, and played in the club's defeat in the 2013 Football League Trophy Final. He joined Port Vale in June 2013, and stayed with the club for one season before moving on to Crawley Town. Following two seasons with Crawley, he joined Dulwich Hamlet in summer 2016 and went on to help the club win promotion out of the Isthmian League Premier Division via the play-offs in 2018, before moving on to Cray Valley Paper Mills in January 2019. Mills won the Southern Counties East League Premier Division title in the 2018\u201319 season and reached the 2019 FA Vase final.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["In preparation for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed to replace the departing Ashley Vincent.

On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place \u2013 far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month."]}, {"page": "Jabo Ibehre", "response": ["Walsall signed Ibehre up following his release from Leyton Orient on 2 July 2008, signing a one-year contract at the club. He scored in the pre-season friendly win against Port Vale on 3 August, and looked to have cemented his place in the starting lineup for the opening League One fixture against Yeovil Town. He started the game on 9 August and duly scored on his professional debut for the club, netting a 77th-minute equaliser after Gavin Tomlin had opened the scoring for Yeovil in the tenth minute. He brought his tally to two goals in two league games on 16 August when he fired home an 89th-minute winner in the Saddlers 2\u20131 win at home to Scunthorpe. At this stage, Ibehre kept his goal target for the season a closely guarded secret, but did say that he believed the decision to leave Brisbane Road would make him a better player and the time was right for a fresh challenge. Manager Jimmy Mullen was impressed by Ibehre's early performances, where he formed a good partnership with former England international striker Michael Ricketts."]}, {"page": "Windsor & Eton F.C.", "response": ["More recently, Morgaro Gomis, Solomon Taiwo and Gavin Tomlin played for the club."]}, {"page": "Craig Reid (footballer, born 1985)", "response": ["Although Aldershot did not initially release Reid, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent, and on 1 August 2013, he returned to League Two when he signed a one-year deal with Southend United.

Reid made his Southend debut two days after signing for the club, on 3 August 2013, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute in a 1\u20130 win over Plymouth Argyle.

With that in mind, Paul Buckle once again dipped into the loan market.  Although current loanee Ryan Gilligan unfortunately had to make an early return to Northampton following a family bereavement, Buckle was able to make an immediate replacement in the form of young Derby midfielder Ben Pringle.  Shortly afterwards, Plainmoor also saw the arrival of two loan strikers in Ronan Murray from Ipswich Town and Gavin Tomlin of Dagenham & Redbridge.   With Buckle eventually negotiating for both forwards to remain with Torquay until the end of the season, the Gulls now had a variety of attacking options with the likes of Jake Robinson, Chris Zebroski, Eunan O\u2019Kane and Billy Kee already causing problems to opposition defences.", "Gavin Tomlin was to make an instant impact, scoring just five minutes into his debut in the home match against Shrewsbury.  It was a game in which the Gulls went on to win 5\u20130, a particularly impressive performance considering the Shrews were currently 4th in the table and had spent the majority of the season in the play-off positions.  Even that result was arguably bettered by Torquay's trip to Gigg Lane three days later where they beat 2nd placed Bury 2\u20131 after coming back from a goal down.  Earlier in the month, Torquay had already claimed four points from two other play-off challengers, grabbing a 1\u20131 draw with Rotherham and a 2\u20130 victory against Stevenage.  In fact, Torquay seemed to be experiencing more problems against teams lower down in the division; the only defeat of the month came away to Aldershot and the Gulls only just managed to sneak a point with a 91st minute Guy Branston header to secure a 3\u20133 draw away at Macclesfield.", "Easter Monday's trip to Burton saw Torquay find their shooting boots again with Chris Zebroski and Gavin Tomlin putting the Gulls 2\u20130 up within the first 15 minutes.  However, not for the first time this season, Torquay managed to surrender a two-goal lead and had to rely on a stunning 78th-minute strike from Billy Kee to rescue a point in a thrilling 3\u20133 draw.  This was a result which left Torquay just outside the play-offs with two games remaining.  The penultimate game of the league campaign was a Friday night encounter at home to champions-elect Chesterfield.  Over 5,000 supporters witnessed yet another 0\u20130 draw which was also Craig Stanley's last game before having to return to parent club Morecambe.  Stanley was perhaps one of Paul Buckle's most successful loan signings and many Gulls fans were hopeful that the midfielder would make a return to Plainmoor next season.  The significance of the Chesterfield draw was only fully felt the following day with Gillingham and Stevenage both losing their matches.  This meant all three teams would go into the final day of the season tied on 68 points with just two play-off spots remaining, although Torquay's superior goal difference left them in pole position.  The Gulls now had to travel to Rotherham knowing they only had to equal or better the Gillingham and Stevenage results in order to guarantee a place in the play-offs.", "|6 || FW ||  || 15 || Gavin Tomlin || 4 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 4", "|15 ||  || FW || Gavin Tomlin || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0", "|15 ||  || FW || Gavin Tomlin || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0", "|Gavin Tomlin"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["* 13 May:The club announces Aidan Downes, Andre McCollin, Scott Murray and Richard Martin will be released; Danny Hutchins has been transfer listed.

The home side doubled their advantage in first-half stoppage time after Eunan O'Kane's  strike beat the Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Ben Smith.  After a goalless second half, the match ended 2\u20130 to Torquay United.  The second leg was held six days later at New Meadow in Shrewsbury.

Fans may well have been wondering if they were feeling the delayed effects of the Manager of the Month 'curse' when the Gulls suffered a second successive loss away to Gillingham.  The 2\u20130 defeat at Priestfield ended in bizarre circumstances with the assistant referee flagging for a penalty when Brian Saah had seemingly brought down former Gulls-loanee Gavin Tomlin in the penalty box.

His ban was later overturned and handed to Chris Lines, who had committed the tackle from behind which started the brawl in which Robertson had attempted to intervene as peacemaker. Vale went on to beat Walsall 1\u20130 with a controversial penalty and in doing so recorded their first double over Walsall in 114 years. Captain Loft and Dan Jones were ruled out of the Vale's next fixture after a training ground confrontation between the pair left Loft with a facial injury. Following a short investigation Jones was sacked by the club. This upheaval seemed not to affect the team as they went 2\u20130 up over Notts County at Meadow Lane, but then four goals without reply from County all but ended Vale's faint hopes of a play-off push. Vale then recorded their fourth straight home win after Jordan Hugill scored the only goal of the game against Milton Keynes Dons. A trip to third-place Rotherham ended with a 1\u20130 defeat, despite the hosts going down to ten men.

Promising forward Jordan Hugill also rejected a contract, and instead signed with Preston North End.

They then disposed of Conference Premier outfit Salisbury City with a 4\u20131 win, though the game had been level at 1\u20131 with less than 15 minutes to go. In the Third Round were League Two side Plymouth Argyle, and Vale seemed to be on their way through to the Fourth Round after first half goals from Gavin Tomlin and Tom Pope, but failed to make the most of their advantage and instead were forced to go to a replay after conceding two goals in the second half. Manager Micky Adams was angry with his team's performance, particularly the defending. Vale twice came from behind in the replay and went on to win 3\u20132 and survived having Chris Lines sent off for a foul in the box as Chris Neal saved the resulting penalty.
