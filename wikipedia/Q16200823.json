Brown described himself as \"a risk-taker; I had a taste for doing plays that are a bit between-the-eyes: most London theatres didn't dare put on Brad Fraser['s plays] because of the explicit sex\". Fraser has been hailed by director Dominic Dromgoole as \"the early prophet, the John the Baptist of the brutalist school that flourished in the mid-nineties. A lot of tricks that tired by the end of the Nineties, the rimming, the sadism, the antibodies, the sexual frankness, the cool irony in the face of outrage, began with Fraser\". Brown also developed \"Scottish work with Scottish actors\" such as the \"provocative\" 1992 play The Life of Stuff written by \"local actor\" Simon Donald. Sierz has said that Brown unknowingly was \"opening the long road that led to Anthony Neilson, to Mark Ravenhill (who was influenced by the work of Canadian Brad Fraser) and to that 1990s youth anthem, Trainspotting\".
