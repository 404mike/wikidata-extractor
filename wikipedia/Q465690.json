Blue Lines was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album's hit single \"Unfinished Sympathy\" and several other tracks, while their rhythms were largely sample-based, were not seen as hip hop songs in any conventional sense. Produced by Dollar, Shara Nelson (an R&B singer) featured on the orchestral \"Unfinished\", and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack's career. Massive Attack released their second album entitled Protection in 1994.
