Los Angeles Times columnist Meghan Daum wrote: \"By asserting that what's between a woman's ears is directly informed by what's between her legs \u2014 'the vagina mediates female confidence, creativity and sense of transcendence,' Wolf writes \u2014 it acts as a perverse echo of Republican efforts to limit reproductive rights.\" In the book, according to Suzanne Moore in The Guardian, \"feminism becomes simply a highly mediated form of narcissism devoid of any actual brain/politics connection.\""]}, {"page": "Next plc", "response": ["In October 2014, the company was one of several retailers criticised by journalist Janice Turner in The Times for failing to pay what she described as a living wage. Turner further argued UK taxpayers pay \u00a328\u00a0billion to low-paid workers through tax credits, and retail companies \u2013 which have the highest proportion of low paid workers \u2013 are exploiting austerity and effectively adding staff wages to the UK welfare bill. When asked to explain the salaries of lower-wage workers despite large profits, a Next spokesperson replied that the company had thirty applicants for every job advertised."]}, {"page": "Robert Webb", "response": ["In December 2018, Webb tweeted his support of an article by Janice Turner in which she criticised Mermaids \u2013 a charity which supports transgender children and their families \u2014 that had sought (and was eventually awarded) a \u00a3500,000 UK National Lottery grant. He also identified himself as a gender-critical feminist, but claimed to oppose transphobia. He stood by the comments in a 2020 interview with The Sunday Times.  In a 2021 interview with Jesse Thorn on the NPR show Bullseye, Webb said that his criticism of Mermaids should not be confused with an opposition to supporting transgender children, and that the debate around gender-nonconforming children had become overheated. When asked about what his opposition to Mermaids was he declined to elaborate further, stating he could no longer remember the specifics. Webb has been criticised by some LGBT news outlets, charities and activists for this stance."]}, {"page": "British Press Awards 2006", "response": ["* Janice Turner (The Times)"]}, {"page": "Orwell Prize", "response": ["**Janice Turner", "**Janice Turner"]}, {"page": "Great Lives", "response": ["|Janice Turner, journalist"]}, {"page": "Have a nice day", "response": ["Janice Turner of The Times supported the phrase, writing that she is indifferent to it being used insincerely or 1,000 times a day.

Speaking on the Moral Maze, she argued that transgender adults should be free to define themselves as they wish, but questioned whether positive affirmation was the only way to help children expressing confusion about gender. Subsequently, she was no-platformed from a King's event by students, and three transgender members complained to the party that she was \"promoting prejudice against the transgender community\". Brunskell-Evans was investigated by the party and subsequently resigned.

Several days later, the NSPCC offered Bergdorf a 'full, frank and unreserved apology' for the way in which it had handled her dismissal. The NSPCC's CEO, Peter Wanless, explained that Bergdorf had been dismissed 'because of her public statements, which we felt would mean that she was in breach of our own risk assessments and undermine what we are here to do'."]}, {"page": "Travis Alabanza", "response": ["In November 2017, Alabanza was denied access to a female dressing-room while shopping at Topshop in Manchester, the fashion retailer owned at the time by Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group. Alabanza was told to use the men's dressing-room. They left the store and filed a complaint through social media. Alabanza accused Topshop of going against their policy to allow trans individuals to use the dressing rooms associated with their preferred gender. The Times published an opinion piece by Janice Turner, incorrectly implying that Topshop's policy was changed because of Alabanza's tweet and claiming the policy would lead to child abuse. Subsequently, Alabanza received online death threats over Topshop's policy."]}, {"page": "Titania McGrath", "response": ["Janice Turner of The Times praised the author in her review of Woke for \"perfectly captur[ing] the chiding, self-righteous, intolerant, joyless tone of the 'woke'\", and added that though \"the politics can be heavy-handed, [...], its satire is a direct hit on the awful state of the left, in all its nihilism, narcissism and illogic, and its self-defeating, petty-minded thought policing. Woke is no joke.\" Patricia Casey of the Irish Independent hailed McGrath's tweets as \"outrageous and hilarious\", leaving her \"addicted, hooked, devoted\". The New Criterion praised Doyle's satirical humour, writing that \"blessed with a pitch perfect ear for absurdity, [he] has revealed the malign hilarity of woke culture\". Emily Sheffield, writing for the Evening Standard, called McGrath's book \"hilarious\", though \"in book form [...] the parody becomes repetitive\". However, she added that \"Virtuousness, virtual or otherwise, is an easy target. Being woke even simpler to satirise.\""]}, {"page": "Kathleen Stock", "response": ["Journalist Janice Turner wrote in The Times that Stock \"teaches trans students, respecting their pronouns, and has written repeatedly in support of their human rights\".", "Stock is lesbian, having come out later in life; in Material Girls, she describes herself as \"a lesbian and... a sex-nonconforming woman\".
