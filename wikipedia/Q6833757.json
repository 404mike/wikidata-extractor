Acting against the advice of the Council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had \"made up his mind\" to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, \"I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people\u2014this is not acceptable\". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, \"Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view\u00a0...

Frank Dobson became Secretary of State and was supported by a team of Ministers keen on introducing clinical and health outcome measures to achieve improvements in the quality and delivery of care. The team included Alan Milburn, Baroness Margaret Jay, and Tessa Jowell. The name and mission was agreed in a meeting between the Ministerial team, Dr Tim Riley and Dr Felicity Harvey shortly after the election and it was agreed that NICE should be described in the first policy white paper, The New NHS: Modern, Dependable 1997. Riley led the team that developed the policy for NICE and which managed the legislation through Parliament in addition to formalising the new institute as a Special Health Authority. Riley joined Sir Michael Rawlins (the then recently appointed Chair of NICE) at the Health Select Committee in February 1999 where questions were raised as to whether NICE was just a means to \"ration\" healthcare. Rawlins presented a compelling case that positioned NICE as a standards setting body first and foremost.
