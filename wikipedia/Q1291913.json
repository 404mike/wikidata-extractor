In a speech made in July 2004 to the British Business Association of Kenya, he famously remarked that the \"gluttony\" of senior figures in the government of President Mwai Kibaki was causing them to \"vomit all over our shoes\". His outspoken views earned him widespread popularity among Kenyan citizens but he became persona non grata with the Kenyan government. More surprisingly, his own (British) government also came to see him as problematic, undermining the distribution of British aid funding to Kenya.He won a scholarship to study at Magdalen College, Oxford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anglo-Leasing scandal", "response": ["The then-British envoy to Kenya, Sir Edward Clay, publicly raised the issue of Anglo-Leasing at a dinner in Nairobi (see the Guardian Newspaper article).
