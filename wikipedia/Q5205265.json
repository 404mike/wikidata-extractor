The subgenre mixed grime with R&B, showcasing a softer side of grime, often with accompanying R&B vocals, while keeping the 140bpm rugged sound of grime. Many UK R&B singers, such as Sadie Ama, Lady Ny, Katie Pearl and Gemma Fox would perform over R&G instrumentals, usually without an MC rapping alongside them. Many grime artists also made various R&G tracks, such as Ruff Sqwad, Wiley, Kano, Skepta and Dizzee Rascal. Producers such as Blackjack, Iron Soul, Low Deep and Kid D also incorporated R&G elements into their instrumentals. Lady Ny has stated she was the first woman to sing on grime, and the first woman to bring out a grime mixtape."]}, {"page": "Cameo", "response": ["* DJ Cameo, a British disc jockey and radio presenter"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend", "response": ["DJ Cameo"]}, {"page": "List of UK garage artists", "response": ["* DJ Cameo"]}, {"page": "Cameo (DJ)", "response": ["#redirect DJ Cameo"]}, {"page": "Glastonbury Festival 2011", "response": [" Comperes MistaJam and DJ Cameo"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 1Xtra", "response": ["* DJ Cameo"]}, {"page": "Scrufizzer", "response": ["Scrufizzer, a member of the production group Funkystepz, released his first mixtape entitled My First Steps in 2007.
