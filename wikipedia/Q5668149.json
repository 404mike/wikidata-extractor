He served in the RAF, rising to the rank of Flight Lieutenant, and took part in more than 70 bombing sorties. He returned to the RAF as a recruiting officer after the end of his cricket career.Crick also played cricket for the Combined Services in 1947, and scored 65 opening the innings for the RAF against the Army at Lord's in 1946.  He kept wicket quite regularly for the Yorkshire Second XI during his career, and played for the South of England and Maurice Leyland's XI in 1947. He was a wicket-keeper who took 20 catches and completed eight stumpings.  He was hampered in his first-class career by a lack of success with the bat, scoring just 124 runs at an average of 9.53, with a best score of 22.\nCrick died in a car crash in February 1960 in Lower Wyke, Bradford, aged 50.  He died the same day as Ted Brooks, the Surrey wicket-keeper, against whom he had played in Arthur Mitchell's benefit match in 1937.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Don Brennan (cricketer)", "response": ["Born in Eccleshill, Bradford, Yorkshire, Brennan played Bradford League cricket for his home town before his break into first-class cricket in 1947.Double debut joy for Tykes, Telegraph & Argus, Retrieved on 19 December 2008 Brennan played two second XI matches in 1946, but first team opportunities were blocked by Paul Gibb, Arthur Wood and Kenneth Fiddling. However, all three had left the club by the start of the 1947 season, leaving Brennan and Harry Crick in competition for the keeper spot."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper Don Brennan, batsmen Willie Watson and Gerald Smithson, fast bowler Alec Coxon and left arm spinner Johnny Wardle. In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches. Other players included Harry Crick, Harry Halliday, Freddie Jakeman, Geoffrey Keighley and pace bowler John Whitehead.Playfair, pp. 95\u201397."]}]}}
