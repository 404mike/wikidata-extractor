He won 12 caps for Wales and was seen as intelligent, mobile forward player.

During the 1891\u201392 season, under captain Tom Graham Newport went unbeaten, winning 29 games and drawing four.

Gould lost the team captaincy for the first match to Frank Hill, a game which Wales lost to Scotland 5\u20131, though Gould did score his first international try. The game is also notable for featuring the first appearance of Billy Bancroft, the Swansea all-round sportsman who would take over the captaincy from Gould on his retirement. Bancroft was fullback in Gould's next 18 international games. Gould regained the captaincy for the next game, an encounter with England at Crown Flatt in Dewsbury, and from that point held the captaincy whenever he represented Wales. The encounter was an historic day for Wales, with the country's first win over England, a single try from Buller Stadden giving Wales the victory. The campaign ended in a disappointing away draw with Ireland, which saw the introduction of Tom Graham, a Newport forward who would become Gould's club captain during the 1891\u201392 \"invincible\"

Wales had never beaten the English, but the England team had missed the last two seasons after an argument with the Scottish Rugby Union and this was their first Championship game of the tournament.

Day represented Wales for the first two games of the tournament, a narrow win over England at Cardiff and a more convincing victory over the Scottish away at Raeburn Place. Although Day was replaced by Swansea's David Samuel for the final game, the resulting win over Ireland gave Wales the Championship, and made Day a Triple Crown winner."]}]}}
