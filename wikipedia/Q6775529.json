He was a founder member and original drummer for The Wonder Stuff, based in Stourbridge (West Midlands, England).\nGilks who was born in Stourbridge, was originally the drummer with Midlands-based The Mighty Lemon Drops before leaving in 1985 (allegedly sacked for not wanting to cut his hair), and later joined Miles Hunt, Malcolm Treece, and Rob \"The Bass Thing\" Jones to form The Wonder Stuff in March 1986. As part of The Wonder Stuff, Martin went on to have a string of top-forty singles and album as well as being voted the best drummer on the planet in an NME poll in 1989. The group split up in 1994.\nHe continued to work with Treece and Paul Clifford (Rob Jones' replacement who joined The Wonder Stuff in 1990) after the split under the name of We Know Where You Live with Ange Dolittle (formerly of Eat) on lead vocals.\nGilks left the group at the end of 1995 to join his brother \"Tank\" in forming Furtive Mass Transit Systems, a management company who would later look after Reef, Lowgold, Cable, A and Hundred Reasons.  We Know Where You Live disbanded the following year.\nWhen The Wonder Stuff reformed in 2000, performing five sell-out shows at the London venue Forum, Gilks also acted as the group's manager and continued to do so until a much-publicised split of the original members in 2004.\nGilks died, aged 41, on 3 April 2006, after losing control of his motorbike in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1965", "response": ["** Martin Gilks, English musician and band manager (d. 2006)"]}, {"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Martin Gilks (The Wonder Stuff)"]}, {"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Martin Gilks"]}, {"page": "The Wonder Stuff", "response": ["The original line-up of Miles Hunt (whose uncle Bill Hunt was keyboard player with ELO and Wizzard) on vocals and guitar; Malcolm Treece on guitar and vocals; bassist Rob \"The Bass Thing\" Jones (died July 1993); and Martin Gilks (died April 2006) on drums grew from Hunt and Treece's collaboration with future members of Pop Will Eat Itself in a band called From Eden that featured Hunt on drums.", "In April 2006, original Wonder Stuff drummer Martin Gilks was killed in a motorcycle accident in London.

The band headed to the US and recorded the album at Supernatural Sound Recording Studio in Oregon and Lash's home studio. The band then enlisted drummer Rob Lee for live dates. The album Welcome To Winners was released in October 2003, named as Symons\u2019 cousin's house backed onto Winnersh railway station where someone had crossed out the H on the \"Welcome To Winnersh\" sign. The band embarked on a UK tour in support of the album, which saw them supported by an up-and-coming Keane at Manchester Roadhouse. The band's comeback single \"We Don't Have Much Time\" wasn't promoted and was then cancelled at the last minute, despite it having already having been distributed to record shops. The album received little promotion and the follow-up single \"The Same Way\" failed to get any radio play in a musical landscape of teen pop and nu metal, the band felt neglected by Sanctuary and the label didn't take up the option for a follow-up. On the band's time with Sanctuary, Ford commented it was \"like watching a misunderstood fat kid swim too far out to sea. Sanctuary decided Tubby wasn't worth saving and the lifeboat stayed in the harbour\".", "Ford continued to write, but had no intention of letting anyone else hear anything until the death of manager Martin Gilks in April 2006 which saw the band reunite to play at his funeral. After Symons heard the demos Ford had recorded, the band started demoing new material in early 2007 and released Promise Lands, their fourth studio album on 31 March 2008 through Goldhawk Recordings/Cooking Vinyl. Ford described the album as \"a very sad record. There are bits of it that are quite raw, bits of it that are quite difficult to listen to for the same reason they were quite hard to write. It\u2019s probably the most personal thing that we\u2019ve done\"."]}, {"page": "The Mighty Lemon Drops", "response": ["After losing original drummer Martin Gilks (later to join the Wonder Stuff), the Drops line-up settled as Paul Marsh (vocals), David Newton (guitar), Tony Linehan (bass), and Keith Rowley (drums). In December 1985 the quartet, now officially the Mighty Lemon Drops, released their first independent single \"Like an Angel\", on Daniel Treacy of Television Personalities' Dreamworld Records label which went to the top of the UK Indie Chart and sold 14,000 copies. They also recorded a session for John Peel around the same time. Becoming part of the C86 movement, which was championed by the New Musical Express, they were soon snapped up by Geoff Travis of Rough Trade for his new Blue Guitar label, a subsidiary of Chrysalis Records.  They signed with Sire Records for the United States and Canada around the same period. Derek Jarman produced the video for the \"Out of Hand\" single in 1987 which was followed by their hit \"Inside Out\" in 1988. In the UK, albums Happy Head and World Without End both charted (#58 and #33 respectively). In the US, World Without End was a number one Modern Rock/College album in 1988 and Happy Head was one of the 50 best albums of the year 1986 according to Sounds magazine critics poll. These two albums relied heavily on Newton's use of a vintage Vox Mark VII semi-acoustic \"Teardrop\" 12-string electric guitar and a Micro-Frets Spacetone 6-string guitar. The band eventually parted company with Chrysalis in the UK after three albums (Happy Head, World Without End and Laughter), failing to repeat their initial independent success, but remained signed with Sire in the US, with Laughter, another US Modern Rock No.\u00a01 entering the lower regions of the Billboard 200 in 1990.
