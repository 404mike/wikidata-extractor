The picaresque plot elements have prompted scholars and reviewers to compare it to similar British urban adventure stories written by Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe.", "When Sarah Waters was 19 years old, she joined a student house in Whitstable, Kent, sharing a bed and then falling in love with another young woman. They lived there for two winters in what became a six-year relationship. She recalled, \"It was cold, isolated, romantic and so intense\u2014quite special.\"McCrum, Robert (10 May 2009). \"What Lies Beneath: Ghosts, Gothic horror, lesbians, poltergeists, female hysteria... There are hidden depths to Sarah Waters...\", The Observer (England), p. 20. In 1995, Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD dissertation on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era. While learning about the activism in socialism, women's suffrage, and utopianism of the period, she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would like to read. Specifically, Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting, diverging from previous lesbian-themed books such as Isabel Miller's Patience and Sarah, in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods. She said to herself at the time, \"there's so much more to lesbian history than that\".Seajay, Carole (Spring 2006). \"Sarah Waters\". Lambda Book Report, pp. 4\u20135.Stockwell, Anne (22 June 1999). \"Sarah Waters: Tipping the Velvet\", The Advocate, p. 124.", "Waters was drawn to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, \"I find it a fascinating period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of the things we think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong\". Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by \"Walter\".Taylor, Debbie (2004), \u2018Sarah Waters\u2019, MsLexia 20, pp. 15\u201317.", "Although Waters was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, she considers herself a London writer because of her intense affection for the city, due in part to her immigration to it. Specifically, Waters is moved by walking through London and seeing remnants of many historical eras: \"It's ... almost like it's peopled with ghosts\u2014again, jostling up against each other or passing through each other. I find that very exciting\".Armitt, Lucy (2007). \"Interview with Sarah Waters (CWWN conference, University of Wales, Bangor, 22 April 2006)\", Feminist Review 85, pp. 116\u2013127. Her love for the city is apparent to many reviewers. In the Lesbian Review of Books Donna Allegra writes, \"[S]he summons the era's attitudes and ambiance projecting them onto the screen of the reader's mind with Dolby wrap-around sound such that you feel you're vacationing on all points between Chelsea and the East End\".Allegra, Donna (Spring 2001). \"Embroidering Life\", Lesbian Review of Books, 7 (3), p. 21.", "Nan's experiences eventually reveal serious faults of the society she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel.Ciocia, Stefania (March 2005). \" 'Journeying against the Current': A Carnivalesque Theatrical Apprenticeship in Sarah Waters's Tipping the Velvet, Literary London: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Representation of London, 3 (1). Retrieved on 30 August 2009. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens;\"Palmer, Paulina (Spring 2008). \" 'She began to show me the words she had written, one by one': Lesbian Reading and Writing Practices in the Fiction of Sarah Waters\", Women, 19 (1), pp. 69\u201386.Stone, Martha (Fall 1999). \"Victorian Soap\", Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review, 6 (4), p. 59.Sweeney, Aiobheann (24 February 2002). \"Stolen Hearts\", The Washington Post, p. T04. the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable until the end of the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.Brace, Marianne (19 January 2002). \"Books: The Books Interview: Bodice-Grippers with Staying Power\", The Independent (London), p. 10.", "Sexuality and sexual identity is the most prevalent theme in the novel. The title is an obscure Victorian pornographic slang reference to cunnilingus.Waters, Sarah (13\u00a0May 2003). \"Taking Velvet Public\", The Advocate, Issue 889, pp. 59\u201360. Nick Rennison in Contemporary British Authors characterises Tipping the Velvet as an \"unabashed and unapologetic celebration of lesbian eroticism and sexual diversity\".\"Sarah Waters\", in Contemporary British Novelists by Rennison, Nick (2005), Routledge. . Donna Allegra writes with appreciation of how the existence of Waters' characters in a heterosexual existence forces an analysis of closeted positions. The sexism of the period puts a stranglehold on women, forcing readers to compare women in the Victorian era with present-day sexual attitudes. Nan never has difficulty accepting her love for Kitty Butler and other women; Kitty's union with Walter, however, \"reeks of lesbophobia\", according to Allegra. Music halls could be rough in some areas, but Kitty is shown handling drunken and rowdy audiences with humour and grace. The only instance where she is overcome and flees the stage is when a drunken patron shouts a euphemism for a lesbian at her. This episode leads to the final scene of Part I when Nan stumbles upon Kitty and Walter in bed. Kitty does not display any pleasure in their union, but rather complacence tinged with shame.Waters, pp. 170\u2013171. Allegra compares Kitty's desire for normality overshadowing her desire for love with Nan to \"compulsory heterosexuality\u00a0... emblematic of and particular to lesbian existence\".", "Music halls, where both Nan and Kitty are employed\u2014and put on display\u2014as male impersonators, allow about half the novel's action and commentary on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers for the first time to perform as Kitty's partner and realises the impact of their double act together, she states, \"whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy\".Wilson, Cheryl (April\u2013May 2006). \"From the Drawing Room to the Stage: Performing Sexuality in Sarah Waters's Tipping the Velvet\", Women's Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 2006 35 (3): pp. 285\u2013305.Waters, p. 123. Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London \"swells\": gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves. Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.", "Writing in 1998 about a period more than 100 years before, Waters employs a continuity between the past and present, particularly as it relates to an outsider's view of sexuality and gender. Diana bestows Nan with the finest gift she had ever received, an expensive watch that requires no winding. She has nowhere to be except at Diana's beck and call, and never leaves Diana's mansion without her.Waters, p. 285. Emily Jeremiah uses this as an example of how Tipping the Velvet fits Judith Halberstam's declaration that homosexual historiographies \"produce alternative temporalities\". Gay and lesbian stories do not use the same rites of passage that most mainstream stories do, leaving aside the importance of birth, marriage, reproduction, and death.Jeremiah, Emily (Summer 2007). \"'The 'I' Inside 'Her': Queer Narration in Sarah Waters's Tipping the Velvet and Wesley Stace's Misfortune, Women: A Cultural Review, 18 (2): pp. 131\u201344. This transcendence of time is evident in the narration of the novel. It is Nan's first-person account of her own past, told many years later. When Nan divulges her past to Florence, Waters uses the first line of the novel to signify where she begins, cycling the story.", "Several reviewers compared Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for a similar story of a woman's sexual awakening.Thomson, Margie (30 June 2001). \"Sarah Waters' knack for demi-monde\", The New Zealand Herald. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing,Atkinson, Frances (17 June 2001). \"Coming Out With a Novel\", Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia), p. 10. but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson was the only other lesbian author they could recall.", "In 2009, UK playwright Amanda Whittington wrote a stage adaptation of Tipping the Velvet.
