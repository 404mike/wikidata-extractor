Observers noted his \"bonhomie and accessibility\" in comparison to the \"asperity and seclusiveness of Mr Fisher\". Cook's term as High Commissioner formally concluded on 10 August 1927, after a six-month extension from the original five-year term.

The main division of opinion centred on the contention of Alfred Deakin, that the lower house must be supreme, as opposed to the views of Barton, John Cockburn and others, that a strong Senate with co-ordinate powers was essential.
