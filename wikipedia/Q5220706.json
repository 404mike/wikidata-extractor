The visitors took the lead late in the first half: Dion Dublin headed down a cross from a short corner to Kevin Russell who struck a left-footed volley into the far corner of the Cambridge goal.  With fifteen minutes of the match remaining, Cambridge's captain Danny O'Shea headed in a equaliser to see the match end in a 1\u20131 draw.  The return leg, at Filbert Street, took place three days later.  Mick Heathcote hit the bar for the visitors and Dublin volleyed wide in an opening period dominated by Cambridge, but it was Leicester who took the lead.  In the 29th minute, Tommy Wright scored after taking advantage of a Richard Wilkins defensive miskick and seven minutes later Steve Thompson made it 2\u20130. Three goals in five second-half minutes settled the match: Russell headed Leicester's third goal in the 59th minute, then Wright scored from a Ian Ormondroyd pass before Ormondroyd scored the fifth of the game.
