He was capped 42 times by the England national team between 2005 and 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country during that time, and appearing at two FIFA World Cup tournaments. He is one of 32 players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals, and holds the record for the most headed goals in Premier League history.Crouch began his career as a trainee with Tottenham Hotspur. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at Dulwich Hamlet and Swedish club IFK H\u00e4ssleholm he joined Queens Park Rangers. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, Portsmouth acquired him in a transfer deal worth \u00a31.5 million. He had a strong first season at Fratton Park, and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined Aston Villa in March 2002 for \u00a35 million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to Norwich City in 2003 before making a move to Southampton, where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining Liverpool in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup and FA Community Shield in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final.\nAfter scoring 42 goals in three seasons at Anfield, Portsmouth re-acquired Crouch for \u00a311 million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international Jermain Defoe. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and Harry Redknapp. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against Manchester City which earned the club a place in the UEFA Champions League. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010\u201311, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined Stoke City in August 2011, for a club record fee of \u00a310 million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's Player of the Year award. He scored eight in 2012\u201313 and ten in both the 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315 seasons. Crouch spent seven-and-a-half years with Stoke, scoring 62 goals before joining Burnley in January 2019.
