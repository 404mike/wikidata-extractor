The philosopher Edward Caird, a fellow at Merton during Creighton's student days there, said of him, \"Creighton possesses common sense in a degree which amounts to genius.\" Later, at Cambridge, some colleagues were perplexed by his personality.  When teaching or transacting academic business, he displayed a shrewd, canny intelligence. However, at social gatherings, much to the delight of the students present, he was continually outrageous and flippant. His relationship with Louise was not easily characterised. In the months after the Peterborough appointment, husband and wife would frequently quarrel, sometimes bitterly, as a niece would later recall. But the couple could also be surprisingly demonstrative for their times: during this same period, a nephew caught sight of Louise locked in passionate embrace with the bishop in the latter's study. Creighton could be stern with his seven children, on one occasion tying a daughter to a table's leg with a rope to aid her in recognising her folly. However, he could also romp around the house with them, engage in horseplay, and make up nonsensical stories\u2014all of which, many years later, they would consider the highlights of their childhood. He was the father of seven: Beatrice in 1872, Lucia in 1874, Cuthbert in 1876, Walter in 1878, Mary in 1880, Oswin in 1883 and, finally, Gemma, born in 1887."]}, {"page": "William Temple (bishop)", "response": ["In 1900 Temple went up to Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a double first in classics and served as president of the Oxford Union. The master of Balliol was the philosopher Edward Caird; the biographer Adrian Hastings comments that Caird's neo-Hegelian idealism provided the philosophical inspiration for many of Temple's academic writings. Temple learned to search for a synthesis in apparently conflicting theories or ideals, and later wrote of \"my habitual tendency to discover that everybody is quite right \u2013 but I was brought up by Caird and I can never get out of that habit\".Iremonger, F.

Long afterwards Lang commented on the inability of some of these eminent figures to handle \"the Scottish boors who formed a large part of their classes\". Lang was most strongly influenced by Caird, who gave the boy's mind \"its first real awakening\". Lang recalled how, in a revelation as he was passing through Kelvingrove Park, he expressed aloud his sudden conviction that: \"The Universe is one and its Unity and Ultimate Reality is God!\" He acknowledged that his greatest failure at the University was his inability to make any progress in his understanding of mathematics, \"to me, then and always, unintelligible\".Lockhart, pp. 10\u201313"]}, {"page": "John Collier (painter)", "response": ["Rudyard Kipling (1891); the painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1884); the actors J.L.

She spent her early years in Liverpool. Her family encouraged her to concentrate on social issues; the family motto was \"What ought to be done, can be done.\" Rathbone went to Kensington High School (now Kensington Prep School), London; and later went to Somerville College, Oxford, over the protests of her mother, and supported by Classics coaching from Lucy Mary Silcox. She studied with tutors outside of Somerville, which at that time did not yet have a Classics tutor, taking Roman History with Henry Francis Pelham, Moral Philosophy with Edward Caird, and Greek History with Reginald Macan. Some of these classes were taken together with Barbara Bradby, a lifelong friend. Rathbone was devoted to her studies, taking little part in the entertainments available to female students such as games, and engaging in limited socialising with male students. Her handwriting was reportedly so poor that she had to dictate her final exam papers to a typist, and she received a result in the Second class. In 1894 she was one of the seven founding members of the \"Associated Prigs\". This was the unofficial name of the discussion group that met on Sundays evenings. The first meeting was in Edith Marvin's room. They never agreed a name or leader but the group would keep notes and the links established were valuable after they left Somerville.
