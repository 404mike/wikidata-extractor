In an attempt to overcome the idea of subcultures as forms of deviance or resistance, they describe subcultures as collectivities which, on a cultural level, are sufficiently homogeneous internally and heterogeneous with respect to the outside world to be capable of developing, as Paul Hodkinson points out, consistent distinctiveness, identity, commitment and autonomy. Defined by Sarah Thornton as taste cultures, subcultures are endowed with elastic, porous borders, and are inserted into relationships of interaction and mingling, rather than independence and conflict, with the cultural industry and mass media, as Steve Redhead and David Muggleton emphasize. The very idea of a unique, internally homogeneous, dominant culture is explicitly criticized. Thus forms of individual involvement in subcultures are fluid and gradual, differentiated according to each actor's investment, outside clear dichotomies. The ideas of different levels of subcultural capital (Sarah Thornton) possessed by each individual, of the supermarket of style (Ted Polhemus) and of style surfing (Martina B\u00f6se) replace that of the subculture's insiders and outsiders \u2013 with the perspective of subcultures supplying resources for the construction of new identities going beyond strong, lasting identifications."]}, {"page": "Moral panic", "response": ["In 1995, Angela McRobbie and Sarah Thornton argued \"that it is now time that every stage in the process of constructing a moral panic, as well as the social relations which support it, should be revised.\" Their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so \"that 'folk devils' are less marginalized than they once were,\" and that 'folk devils' are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well.
