He was convicted and executed for the murder of a woman in Melbourne, Australia. He is remembered today because he was suspected by some of being the notorious serial killer Jack the Ripper.\nDeeming was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, England, son of Thomas Deeming, brazier, and his wife Ann (n\u00e9e Bailey). He was a \"difficult child\" according to writers Maurice Gurvich and Christopher Wray. At 16 years of age, he ran away to sea, and thereafter he began a long career of crime, largely thieving and obtaining money under false pretenses. He was also responsible for the murder of his first wife Marie and his four children at Rainhill, England, on or about 26 July 1891, and a second wife, Emily Mather, at Windsor, Melbourne, on 24 December 1891.\nLess than three months elapsed between the discovery of Mather's body in Windsor, Melbourne, in March 1892, and Deeming's execution for her murder in May 1892; a remarkably short time by comparison to modern western legal standards. This was not only due to efficient police work, but also a result of the considerable international media interest the murder attracted. For example, it was an English journalist working for the Melbourne Argus who first approached Mather's mother in Rainhill and delivered the news of her daughter's murder. Another factor was Deeming's behaviour in public, for while he often used different names, he usually drew attention to himself with behaviour variously described as aggressive, ostentatious, ingratiating and overly attentive to women.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Deakin", "response": ["The government was brought down in 1890, over its use of the militia to protect non-union labour during the maritime strike.

Miss Emily Mather married Frederick Bailey Deeming, who called himself Albert Williams and posed as an officer in the army. The couple emigrated to Melbourne, where Deeming murdered his wife and buried her under the floor of their kitchen. Victoria Police contacted Scotland Yard, who, as a result of information passed onto them, made a search of Dinham Villa, home of Deeming's supposed sister and her four children.
