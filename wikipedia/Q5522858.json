He started his career as an apprentice at Chelsea and made his first team debut on 5 May 1987 against Wimbledon, having featured in a reserve match earlier in the day. He made a total of 198 League appearances during his time at the club, although the number of matches he played was limited by the presence of Steve Clarke. Hall was a member of the Chelsea team that won the 1990 Full Members Cup at Wembley Stadium.He moved to Sunderland in January 1996, having originally been on loan there. Hall went on to make 48 League appearances for the club.Hall joined Swindon Town in May 1998 and played in most games during his first two seasons. Following the arrival of Colin Todd he was told he could leave on a free transfer, but continued training with the team and he ended up playing a few more matches for them, before leaving in May 2001 to join Havant & Waterlooville. In total he made 97 senior appearances for Swindon, scoring 3 goals.He won 9 international caps for Wales, first being selected for the senior side on 23 March 1988, in a 2\u20131 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia. His last cap came on 29 April 1992 in a 1\u20131 friendly draw with Austria.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Chelsea F.C. players", "response": ["|  Gareth Hall"]}, {"page": "Darren Barnard", "response": ["Chelsea paid non-league Wokingham Town \u00a3100,000 to seal the signature of 18-year-old Barnard in July 1990. He had to wait almost 2 years for his first-team debut as he was competing with the established first-team players Gareth Hall and Frank Sinclair for a place in the team. During his time at Chelsea, Barnard played for Bobby Campbell, Ian Porterfield and Glenn Hoddle, but was only given a regular run in the team by caretaker manager David Webb. Barnard was signed at a time when the Blues were attempting to boost their standing in the First Division with the expensive purchases of Dennis Wise and Andy Townsend, Barnard was forced to wait almost two years for his first-team debut. Comfortable playing anywhere along the left-flank, his first appearance was as a replacement for Vinnie Jones in a 2\u20131 win over West Ham United towards the end of the 1991\u201392 season, and after two further substitute appearances he was rewarded with his first start, it comes in a disappointing 3\u20131 defeat at Aston Villa. Manager Ian Porterfield resisted the opportunity to include Barnard in his side at the beginning of the following campaign, preferring to play Gareth Hall out of position in the absence of regular left-back Frank Sinclair, and with the exception of an outing at Coventry City in October it wasn't until the final three months of the campaign \u2013 after David Webb was drafted in to replace Porterfield for the remainder of the season \u2013 that Barnard became a regular fixture. Given the freedom to roam on the left of Chelsea's midfield, he impressed with a number of cultured displays, the best of which came against Middlesbrough when he came up against Boro's right-back Curtis Fleming eventually leading to the Irishman's injuring Barnard with a cut to the shin. He scored his first goal for the club that day, in what was a 4\u20130 win, and could look back with pride on a record that season of eight starts resulting in five wins, two draws and just a single defeat. However, Barnard was restricted to only nine starts in 1993\u201394, primarily as a left-back. A mid-table league campaign was compensated for by a run to the final of the FA Cup, and although he did not feature in the final itself, Barnard did play in the semi-final victory over Luton Town after replacing the injured Craig Burley late in the first half. He struck his only goal of the season in a 2\u20130 defeat of West Ham in March, and his final appearance for the club came six weeks later when he was selected for in the side that was beaten by Coventry City as Hoddle chose to protect his likely cup final team. Despite remaining with the club for a further 18 months, Barnard failed to reappear in the first-team, eventually joining Bristol City in October 1995 for a fee of \u00a3175,000, a move which proved to be a launching pad for his career as he went on to become a full international in the colours of Wales."]}, {"page": "West London derby", "response": ["* Gareth Hall \u2013 first Chelsea, then Brentford."]}, {"page": "Hall (surname)", "response": ["*Gareth Hall (born 1969), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.
