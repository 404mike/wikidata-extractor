Based on this description, she is typically assumed to be between fifteen and seventeen years old upon meeting him and thus born in 1100\u201301.Historia Calamitatum, in Betty Radice, trans, The Letters of Abelard and Heloise, (Penguin, 1974), p. 66 There is a tradition that she died at the same age as did Abelard (63) in 1163 or 1164. The term adolescent, however, is vague, and no primary source of her year of birth has been located. Recently, as part of a contemporary investigation into Heloise's identity and prominence, Constant Mews has suggested that she may have been so old as her early twenties (and thus born around 1090) when she met Abelard.Constant J Mews, Abelard and Heloise, (Oxford, 2005), p. 59 The main support for his opinion, however, is a debatable interpretation of a letter of Peter the Venerable (born 1092) in which he writes to H\u00e9lo\u00efse that he remembers that she was famous when he was still a young man. Constant Mews assumes he must have been talking about an older woman given his respect for her, but this is speculation. It is just as likely that a female adolescent prodigy amongst male university students in Paris could have attracted great renown and (especially retrospective) praise.  It is at least clear that she had gained this renown and some level of respect before Abelard came onto the scene.", "Abelard tells of their subsequent illicit relationship, which they continued until H\u00e9lo\u00efse became pregnant. Abelard moved H\u00e9lo\u00efse away from Fulbert and sent her to his own sister, Denise, in Brittany, where H\u00e9lo\u00efse gave birth to a boy, whom she called Astrolabe (which is also the name of a navigational device that is used to determine a position on Earth by charting the position of the stars).Historia Calamitatum, in Betty Radice, trans, The Letters of Abelard and Heloise, (Penguin, 1974), p. 69", "Abelard agreed to marry H\u00e9lo\u00efse to appease Fulbert, although on the condition that the marriage should be kept secret so as not to damage Ab\u00e9lard's career. Heloise insisted on a secret marriage due to her fears of marriage injuring Abelard's career. Likely, Abelard had recently joined Religious Orders (something on which scholarly opinion is divided), and given that the church was beginning to forbid marriage to priests and the higher orders of clergy (to the point of a papal order re-affirming this idea in 1123),Brief History of Celibacy in the Catholic Church. https://www.futurechurch.org/brief-history-of-celibacy-in-catholic-church public marriage would have been a potential bar to Abelard's advancement in the church. H\u00e9lo\u00efse was initially reluctant to agree to any marriage, but was eventually persuaded by Abelard.Historia Calamitatum, in Betty Radice, trans, The Letters of Abelard and Heloise, (Penguin, 1974), pp. 70\u201374. H\u00e9lo\u00efse returned from Brittany, and the couple was secretly married in Paris. As part of the bargain, she continued to live in her uncle's house.", "Fulbert immediately went back on his word and began to spread the news of the marriage. H\u00e9lo\u00efse attempted to deny this, arousing his wrath and abuse. Abelard rescued her by sending her to the convent at Argenteuil, where she had been brought up. H\u00e9lo\u00efse dressed as a nun and shared the life of the nuns, though she was not veiled. Fulbert, infuriated that Heloise had been taken from his house and possibly believing that Abelard had disposed of her at Argenteuil in order to be rid of her, arranged for a band of men to break into Abelard's room one night and castrate him. In legal retribution for this vigilante attack, members of the band were punished, and Fulbert, scorned by the public, took temporary leave of his canon duties (he does not appear again in the Paris cartularies for several years).Historia Calamitatum, in Betty Radice, trans, The Letters of Abelard and Heloise, (Penguin, 1974), p. 75", "Heloise rose in the church, first achieving the level of prioress of Argenteuil. At the disbandment of Argenteuil and seizure by the monks of St Dennis under Abbot Suger, Heloise was transferred to the  Paraclete, where Abelard had stationed himself during a period of hermitage. (He had dedicated his chapel to the Paraclete, the holy spirit, because he \"had come there as a fugitive and, in the depths of my despair, was granted some comfort by the grace of God\".\"The Letters of Abelard and Heloise\", Betty Radice, Trans. London: Penguin, 1973. P. 30) They now rededicated it as a convent, and Abelard moved on to St. Gildas in Brittany where he became abbot. Heloise became prioress and then abbess of the Paraclete, finally achieving the level of  prelate nullius (roughly equivalent to bishop).

Of all the versions available to him, only E could be called a complete narrative of Gibbon's life up to the 1790s, yet this one was very short on detail, and by no means a substantial work.  The other manuscripts were more circumstantial, but all left the story unfinished.  His solution was to produce a composite version, taking passages or individual sentences from each, especially from F, and shaping them into an artistically satisfying whole.  Choosing the title Memoirs of My Life and Writings, he made the resulting work the centerpiece of a collection of inedited Gibboniana published in 1796 in two quarto volumes as Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon Esquire.  The work was reprinted many times through the 19th century, and remained the only published form of Gibbon's autobiography until 1896, when the publisher John Murray produced an edition giving the full text of all six manuscripts.  Two years later the American scholar Oliver Farrar Emerson edited the manuscripts along similar lines.  In 1966 Georges Bonnard returned to Lord Sheffield\u2019s plan of producing an eclectic edition, though with far greater scholarly conscientiousness.
