Yam [2008] (trial of Wang Yam for the murder of Allan Chappelow) \u2013 In December 2007 the Crown Prosecution Service indicated it would ask for this trial for murder, burglary and deception to be held \"in camera\", making it the first UK murder trial ever heard behind closed doors without access by press or public. A public-interest immunity certificate was sought by the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith; it was reported by the Times on 13 December 2007 that the grounds were \"on the basis of protecting national security interests and to protect the identity of informants\". A further order was made under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 prohibiting the press from any speculation as to the reasons for parts of the trial being held in private. In the Court of Appeal on 28 January, the \"gagging order\" was upheld, with the Lord Chief Justice insisting that a fair trial would be possible even if some or all of it is held \"in camera\".Regina v.
