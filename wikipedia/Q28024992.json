It was innovated by Chris Kanyon. Baron Corbin's finisher is a variant of this move called the End of Days while Angelina Love uses the move as a signature (previously a finisher) called Lights Out. Another variation of this move involves using a pumphandle lift where the wrestler sets the opponent up for a pumphandle hold and then lifts them into the execution of the move. Pete Dunne uses this variation as a finisher previously calling it Drop Dead but now known as the Bitter End. Austin Theory uses a flipping version of this move in which, to a bent over opponent, he hooks his opponent's near arm with his far arm and hooks their near leg with his near arm. He then lifts the opponent off the mat flipping them forwards while simultaneously falling backwards to catch the falling them with his near arm completing the rotation and dropping them into the facebuster. He calls this move Ataxia."]}, {"page": "In Your House", "response": ["| Karrion Kross (c) vs. Adam Cole vs. Kyle O'Reilly vs. Johnny Gargano vs. Pete Dunne in a fatal five-way match for the NXT Championship"]}, {"page": "Ladder match", "response": ["|Pete Dunne defeated Kyle O'Reilly", "|Pete Dunne"]}]}}
