Clark attended King's College, Cambridge before leaving at the age of 18 to join the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War.  Discovered to be colour blind he was relegated to non-seagoing posts, a prospect he found unappealing.  He volunteered for service with the Special Operations Executive and saw active service in Italy, first on amphibious missions and later as a liaison officer with partisans in the Piedmont Mountains.  Clark was captured by the Germans, and was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his gallantry.\nA chance meeting after the war led to a position at the law firm of Slaughter & May, where he was soon made a partner.  He switched career to become a merchant banker with Hill Samuel, where he developed an expertise in company mergers and acquisitions.  Clark acted as chairman or director for numerous firms and sat on many governments bodies and committees.  Clark met Robert Maxwell in 1969 when Maxwell attempted to outbid Rupert Murdoch for the News of the World, starting a lifelong acquaintance.  He led Hill Samuel through their takeover by TSB before Maxwell brought him on as a non-executive director at his Mirror Group of media companies.\nClark became embroiled in the scandal at the Mirror Group that unfolded after Maxwell's death in 1991.  Clark claimed to be ignorant of Maxwell's \u00a3492 million defrauding of the company and its pension scheme, and faced a non-confidence vote by the shareholders.  He survived to be made chairman of the group and to rebuild it after the scandal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Clark", "response": ["*Robert Clark (actor) (born 1987), American-born Canadian television actor", "*Robert Clark (film executive) (1905\u20131984), Scottish film executive", "*Robert Clark (author) (born 1952), American novelist", "*Robert Clark (poet), see 1911 in poetry", "*Robert Clark (academic), co-founded The Literary Encyclopedia", "*Robert Clark (gridiron football) (born 1965), American football player", "*Robert Clark (footballer, born 1962), Scottish association football player", "*Robert Clark (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131970), English footballer for Liverpool F.C.", "*Robert Clark (wrestler) (born 1939), Australian Olympic wrestler", "*Robert Clark (Australian politician) (born 1957), member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "*Robert Clark (mayor), mayor of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 1890\u20131894", "*Robert Clark (New York politician) (1777\u20131837), member of Congress from New York", "*Robert Clark (physicist), Australian Chief Defence Scientist and academic; involved in development of Kane quantum computer", "*Robert Clark (businessman) (1924\u20132013), British naval officer and businessman", "*Robert Clark (exonerated convict), exonerated with help of the Georgia Innocence Project after 24 years in prison", "*Robert Clark (missionary) (1825\u20131900), British Church Missionary Society missionary", "*Robert Clark (naval architect), British yacht designer, designed British Steel", "*Robert Clark (photojournalist), American photojournalist; see Mem Nahadr", "*Robert Indiana (1928\u20132018), American artist born Robert Clark", "*Robert Clark (priest) (1907\u20131998), Dean of Edinburgh", "*Robert Clarke (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Sir Robert Clark", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Clark (businessman)"]}]}}
