A right-handed batsman, he played cricket for Warwickshire from 1883 until 1896.  He made three centuries, against Yorkshire in 1889, against Hampshire in 1889, and against Cheshire in 1890, but all before Warwickshire achieved first-class status in 1894.  He played seven games of first-class cricket after Warwickshire became a first-class county, six in 1895 and one in 1896.  He achieved his highest first-class score of 61 not out against Lancashire in July 1895, his only first-class half century.[1]  He also took 4 catches in first-class matches.\nHe was an umpire in the University Match in 1895, and in the County Championship match between Yorkshire and Middlesex at Bramall Lane in August 1897.  He was a regular first-class umpire from 1898 to 1914.  He umpired 10 Test matches between 1899 and 1912, all played in England, six involving Australia and four South Africa\nHe made his debut as a Test umpire in the 5th Ashes Test in August 1899, played at the Oval, standing with Archibald White.  His second Test as umpire was the 3rd Ashes Test in July 1902, the only Test match played at Bramall Lane.  He umpired the 2nd Ashes Test, at Lord's, in June 1905, and then the 3rd Test, at the Oval, against South Africa in August 1907.  He was umpire in the 3rd, 4th and 5th Ashes Tests in 1909, at Headingley, Old Trafford and the Oval, and umpired three matches between England and South Africa in the 1912 Triangular Tournament, at Headingley, Lord's and the Oval.\nHe died in Hollywood, Worcestershire, near Birmingham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Walter Richards \u2013 Cricketer and umpire"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Walter Richards||||10||1899||1912"]}, {"page": "Aubrey Faulkner", "response": ["Faulkner was first coached as a cricketer by Walter Richards, a former cricketer-turned-umpire. After the end of the war, Faulkner was given a chance to play two first-class cricket matches for Transvaal in the 1902/03 Currie Cup Tournament. He batted at nine in both games and only bowled for five wicketless overs. He wasn't seen as anything more than an average cricketer at the time, and he didn't play a match in the following season."]}, {"page": "Walter Richards", "response": ["Walter Richards may refer to:", "*Walter Richards (umpire) (1863\u20131917), English first-class cricketer and Test match umpire", "*Walter Richards (canoeist) (born 1942), American sprint canoer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Walter Richards (1895\u20131896) : W.

Whitehead attended the match and, according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, was \"apparently in his usual health\". A newspaper report later that week, however, states that at the end of the match on the Wednesday evening, \"he complained of feeling unwell, but his colleagues thought he was suffering from the effects of excitement\". The following day, the newspaper reported, a doctor was called and pronounced that Whitehead had \"English cholera\", now called dysentery; he died the same evening. Further explanation came from an inquest held the following week: Whitehead, the inquest heard, had drunk some \"stale beer\" while playing for Stratford Cricket Club on the Saturday preceding his benefit match and that, combined with consumption (tuberculosis), had produced \"acute gastro enteritis\" which was cited as the cause of death."]}, {"page": "James Whitehead (South African cricketer)", "response": ["Whitehead was a protege of Walter Richards, the old Warwickshire cricketer who coached in South Africa, and returned with Richards with a view to joining the Warwickshire staff when qualified through residence. He was described as \"a left-handed medium-paced bowler [who] makes the ball get up very quickly from the pitch\" and a left-handed \"promising\" batsman, and had played for the Cape Town Cricket Club. In the event, as he was not qualified for County Championship games, he played only one first-class match for Warwickshire, the match against London County in 1902, scored just one run in his only innings and failed to take a wicket."]}]}}
