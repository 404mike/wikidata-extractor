He was the son of Benjamin Harper Burrows (1864-1915), a scholar and teacher of some repute, who played violin, viola and later cello, and was closely involved with the Leicester Orchestral Union from 1884 until his death. His mother was Mary Elizabeth (born Gray 1867) who was an excellent pianist. His sister was violinist, teacher and orchestra conductor Grace Burrows.  He was born at 12 College Street, Leicester and attended Alderman Newton's Boys School. He showed such a marked aptitude for science that he moved to a school specialising in this. Later he was tutored privately which was felt necessary due to a serious problem with his left eye. Music played a huge part in his upbringing and having chosen music as a career, Burrows studied organ with H. P. Ellis and music theory with Charles Kitson. In 1912 he graduated ARCO at the Royal College of Organists and soon afterwards becoming a fellow (FRCO). In both exams he won recognition for achieving top marks. By 1914 he had set up as a music teacher and was giving organ recitals in De Montfort Hall, Leicester. During WW1 he served as a Kite Balloonist at Orford Ness, Suffolk. He also met Doris Katharine Hayes who he married in 1921, the same year in which he was awarded his doctorate. Their only child, Benjamin Hayes Burrows was born in 1925. He served briefly as organist at Leicester Cathedral but in 1929 he was appointed organist at Victoria (now University) Road Church then a Baptist church, in line with his non-conformist principles. He remained there for 27 years.  "]}, {"page": "Leicester Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Leicester Symphony Orchestra is based in Leicester, England.
