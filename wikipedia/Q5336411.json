This success was largely driven by the network of underground fanzines, the most important and far reaching of which were Extraordinary Sensations, produced by future radio DJ Eddie Piller, and Shadows & Reflections, published by future national magazine editor Chris Hunt. The latter in particular pushed back the boundaries of fanzine production, producing glossy, professionally written and printed publications at a time (1983\u201386) when most fanzines were produced via photocopier and letraset."]}, {"page": "The Brand New Heavies", "response": ["The group came up with the Heavies name after signing their first record contract, borrowing from a liner note on a James Brown single declaring the artist \"Minister of New Super Heavy Funk\".Interview with Jon Scragg, Jazz FM 102.2 (London), 22 October 2004.

The name refers to the acid house genre, which was popular in UK clubs in the 1980s.", "Acid jazz has its origins in the 1960s, when psychedelic styles were being incorporated into other musical genres, jazz being one of these. Some cite \"Six Pack\" and \"Soul Fiesta\" by The Apostles (1969) as acid jazz records during the 1960s. Acid jazz became popular in London clubs during the 1980s when disc jockeys associated with the rare groove movement played obscure jazz records. Their interests were in the fringe of jazz fusion, jazz funk, and the soul jazz of the 1950s and 1960s. Particularly significant were records from the Blue Note catalogue. These DJs included Gilles Peterson, who had residencies at several London clubs in the 1980s. Peterson began in a small pirate radio station and then moved to the larger Kiss-FM. In 1988 with producer Eddie Piller he formed the label Acid Jazz Records. The first release from the company was the compilation Totally Wired, which contained obscure jazz funk tracks from the 1970s with updated new tracks."]}, {"page": "Martin Freeman", "response": ["Freeman's personal style follows that of British mod subculture, and he cites Paul Weller as one of his heroes and influences on his style.

Playing alongside fellow London DJ Patrick Forge, the night, dubbed Talkin' Loud And Sayin' Something, ran for five years. It coincided with the rise of acid house in UK clubland and would grow to establish itself as a legendary session. The sessions were characterised by jazz dancers in suits, hats and spats, well-known jazz dance classics including tracks from Yusef Lateef, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Airto, Herbie Hancock, and the anthemic In The Fast Lane by Jean-Luc Ponty; but the jazz was fused with hip-hop and the more experimental tracks. It was at a Special Branch show, with fellow DJ Chris Bangs, that the term \"acid jazz\" was coined, starting as an in-joke. At the time, acid house was in the ascendant, and at one of the shows Bangs played a rare groove record, grabbed the mic and shouted: \"Fuck that, if that was acid house, this is acid jazz!\u201d.
