She released two singles, \"Woman to Man\" and \"Temple of Love\", in 1990, on EastWest/Atlantic Records. \"Temple of Love\" cracked the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1991, peaking at #39. Her single also reached #14 on the US Billboard R&B chart.  Harriet released an album, Woman To Man on East West Records, but is remembered only as a one-hit wonder in the US.\nIn 1991, Harriet took part in the Italian Song Festival in San Remo with the English version of the song \"In questa citt\u00e0\"  (written by Pino Daniele and performed in Italian by Loredana Bert\u00e8). The English version was titled, \"All That We Are\".\nShe co-wrote the song \"Whatever You Need\" with Russ Courtenay for Tina Turner's 1999 album, Twenty Four Seven.\nIn 2014, she released the digital album Reality containing ten tracks, under the name Harriet Roberts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harriet (tortoise)", "response": ["Harriet ( \u2013 23 June 2006) was a Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise (Chelonoidis porteri) who had an estimated age of 175 years at the time of her death in Australia. Harriet is one of the longest-lived known tortoises, behind Tu'i Malila, who died in 1965 at the age of 188, and possibly Adwaita, who died in 2006 at an estimated age of between 150 and 255 years. At the time of her death, she lived at the Australia Zoo which was owned by Steve and Terri Irwin.176-year-old 'Darwin's tortoise' dies in zoo, from NBC News", "Harriet was reportedly collected by Charles Darwin during his 1835 visit to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands as part of his round-the-world survey expedition, transported to England, and then taken to her final home, Australia, by John Clements Wickham, the retiring captain of the Beagle. However, some doubt was cast on this story by the fact that Darwin had never visited the island that Harriet originally came from.", "==Harriet's species==", "That the species Harriet represents was not from one of the islands visited by Darwin is not actually problematic. Darwin definitely collected tortoises on San Cristobal, San Salvador, and Santa Maria; however, the species on Santa Maria (G. nigra) was, in fact, already nearing extinction when Darwin visited the islands, having been killed and eaten by prisoners on the prison colony there. Yet Darwin still collected tortoises on Santa Maria: the tortoises he found had been retrieved by the prisoners from other islands for food and Darwin collected some of these before they reached the stewpot. Hence they were a mixture of subspecies from a number of islands. Harriet, as a G. porteri, is from Santa Cruz. One of the other tortoises (Tom) is still in the Queensland Museum and has been identified as a G. chathamensis (from San Cristobal).", "==Other theories about Harriet==", "thumb|Harriet, 2002", "An initial analysis of Harriet's DNA was unable to identify her species in a cross section of 900 animals representing 26 extant and extinct populations. After reanalysis she was assigned to G. porteri. However, her genetic diversity and other factors in her DNA sequence data indicated she was most likely at least two generations removed from the oldest specimens of her species in the dataset. The oldest G. porteri in the dataset were collected as adults in 1907 and, hence, this would require Harriet to be hatched by 1860.", "This dating rules out many alternate possibilities for Harriet as, prior to 1900, Australia was a very difficult place to get to. There were only two imports of Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises prior to 1900, and four of the five animals involved have been accounted for and are still represented by museum material. The suggestion in some quarters that Harriet was collected by whalers and brought to Australia is not likely, as Australia had its own whaling industry and whaling ships from South America did not visit Australia.", "The tortoises collected by Darwin were all recorded in Fitzroy's journals of the voyage, including their measurements. As they averaged  in length, and this represented an approximate age of 5 years for the species, Harriet's year of birth was estimated by Scott Thomson to 1830, with an error of two years either way, in the 1995 paper describing the events of Harriet's life and the results of the research.", "Some also believe that Harriet was left with the Yabsley family of Coraki who were also on the Beagle.", "Harriet was thought to be male for many years and was actually named Harry after Harry Oakman, the creator of the zoo at the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, but this was corrected in the 1960s by a visiting director of Hawaii's Honolulu Zoo (as it happens, Tom, the specimen in the Queensland Museum, was also a female).", "On 15 November 2005, her much-publicized 175th birthday was celebrated at Australia Zoo. This event was attended by Scott Thomson (the researcher on Harriet's history), three generations of the Fleay family, Robin Stewart (author of Darwin's Tortoise), and many hundreds of others who knew this tortoise during the latter part of her life.", "Harriet died in her enclosure on 23 June 2006 of heart failure following a short illness.", "Harriet was said to be very good-natured. She loved the attention of humans and enjoyed it when people patted her on the scutes (plates which make up the carapace, or upper shell). Harriet spent a majority of her day napping at her home pond. Her favourite food was hibiscus flowers.", "* ca. 1828\u20131832: Harriet hatches, probably on Santa Cruz.", "* 1835: Harriet is probably collected by Charles Darwin and taken to England.", "* ca. 1870: The earliest first-hand account of Harriet.", "* 1952: Harriet moves to Fleay's Fauna Sanctuary.", "* 1987: Harriet moves to the Queensland Reptile Park (Australia Zoo).", "* 1995: Harriet's remarkable history and the results of the research are presented.", "* 2005: Harriet's 175th birthday is attended by many people who had a long association with her.", "* 2006: On 23 June, Harriet dies of heart failure at Australia Zoo.", "Harriet's story was told in Robin Stewart's book Darwin's Tortoise: The Amazing True Story of Harriet, the World's Oldest Living Creature.
