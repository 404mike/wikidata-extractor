He joined Northamptonshire in 1964, and the following season, coming into the side regularly from mid-July, took 42 wickets at an average of 18 each, including 27 in just three matches. Northamptonshire finished second in the County Championship, four points behind the eventual winners, Worcestershire, the closest the team has ever come to winning the title.\nIn 1966, Sully played the full season and took 101 wickets at 21 runs each, the only time he took 100 wickets in a season. He was awarded his county cap as the side's leading wicket-taker. He played regularly for Northamptonshire in both the 1967 and 1968 seasons, but though he took 80 wickets in 1967, the average had risen to more than 30, and his 51 wickets in 1968 cost more than 34 runs each. He played only a few matches in 1969 and left first-class cricket at the end of the season.\nSettling in Devon where he worked for Whiteways Cyder, Sully played a few times for Devon in the Minor Counties in 1970 and 1971, and captained the Sidmouth cricket club for several years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Haydn Sully"]}, {"page": "Sampford Brett", "response": ["It was the birthplace of the professional cricketer Haydn Sully."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Haydn Sully (1959\u20131963) 12 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Haydn Sully", "|align=left|Haydn Sully"]}, {"page": "Sully (surname)", "response": ["* Haydn Sully (1939\u20132006), English cricketer"]}]}}
