He founded the empirical brand of philosophy known as Australian realism.\nAnderson's promotion of 'freethought' in all subjects, including politics and morality, was controversial and brought him into constant conflict with the august senate of the university. However, he is credited with educating a generation of influential 'Andersonian' thinkers and activists\u2014some of whom helped to place Sydney in the forefront of the 'sexual revolution' of the 1950s and 1960s.\nTo Anderson, an acceptable philosophy must have significant 'sweep' and be capable of challenging and moulding ideas in every aspect of intellect and society.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
