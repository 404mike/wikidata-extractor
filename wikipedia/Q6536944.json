Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French scaphandre \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of lifejacket\"). Some of these distortions may have been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including Daniel O'Connell among other international figures. Nevertheless, Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later \"re-translations\" continued to recycle its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas)."]}, {"page": "Mercier", "response": ["*Lewis Page Mercier, or Louis Mercier, an English translator of Jules Verne's novels"]}, {"page": "Around the Moon", "response": ["* Round the Moon \u2014 This is the original translation of Lewis Page Mercier and Eleanor E.
