I. Best, was an Irish scholar who specialised in Celtic Studies.Best was born into a Protestant family in Derry and educated at Foyle College before working for a time in a bank. As a young man he went to Paris to study Old Irish, where he met Kuno Meyer and attended Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville's lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. On his return to Ireland he translated the latter's  Le Cycle Mythologique Irlandais et la Mythologie Celtique into English and became Assistant Director at the National Library of Ireland in 1904.He married Edith Oldman, a musician, in 1906 and the couple were active in the administration of the Feis Ceoil. Edith was six years Best's senior and the sister of Professor C. H. Oldman of University College Dublin. The couple had no children.From 1913 onwards he published his multi-volume Bibliography of Irish Philology and Manuscript Literature: Publications (1913\u20131941). Best was director of the National Library from 1929 to 1940. He was Senior Professor of Celtic Studies at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies from its establishment in 1940. He was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy from 1943 to 1946. He served as chairman of the Irish Manuscripts Commission from 1948 to 1956 and was an honorary fellow of the Bibliographical Society of Ireland. Best was awarded honorary doctorates by the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin and the Leibniz Medal of the Royal Prussian Academy.He died at his home, 57 Upper Leeson Street, on 25 September 1959.Best was an acquaintance of J. M. Synge and James Joyce. Joyce depicted Best in Ulysses as one of the characters in the National Library scene in Episode 9 Scylla and Charybdis. Best was known to have disapproved of Joyce's characterisation of him. According to Frank O'Connor, Best boasted that he was the only person in Dublin from whom Joyce never succeeded in  borrowing  money. Flann O'Brien affectionately satirised him alongside his fellow scholars D. A. Binchy and Osborn Bergin in his poem Binchy and Bergin and Best. He was a close friend of George Moore, and according to a well-known story,  he had to explain to Moore that \"it were better\"  is not bad English but the subjunctive mood; Moore apparently had never heard of it, but vowed that he would never again use any mood  but the subjunctive.The R. I. Best Memorial Lectures were established by the National Library in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aos S\u00ed", "response": ["* De Jubainville, M. H.

Yeats, Richard Irvine Best, Frank O'Connor, Francis Stuart and Iseult Gonne. She became particularly close to Yeats, who she confided in. Yeats recorded their weekly consultations in his diary while working on A Vision (1925). In his Oxford anthology of English verse from 1936, he included one of O'Neill's poems. In 1917, she contributed lyrics to her husband's play The kingdom maker. She published her only book in 1929, Prometheus and other poems.

I. Best, \"Notes on the Script of Lebor na hUidre\", \u00c9riu 6, 1912, pp. 161\u2013174 A and M are believed to be contemporary. A began the manuscript and wrote the opening pages of several of the texts, which were continued by M, who Best identified as M\u00e1el Muire mac C\u00e9ilechair meic Cuinn na mBocht, based on matching the handwriting with two marginal probationes pennae or pen tests, in which the scribe wrote his name. A much later note elsewhere in the manuscript names M\u00e1el Muire as the person who \"wrote and compiled this book from divers[e] books\". His murder by Vikings at Clonmacnoise is recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters in 1106,Annals of the Four Masters M1106.7 giving us a latest possible date and location for the main body of the manuscript. Some time later, H (named for his addition of two homilies) added a number of new texts and passages, sometimes over erased portions of the original, sometimes on new leaves.

F. O'Rahilly. He pioneered an approach to early Irish texts which focused on their literary merit and their affinities with the other literatures of the medieval world. His Studies in Irish Literature and History which appeared in 1956 challenged the 'nativist' approach to Irish literature which had dominated the scholarship of the previous decades. His work on Saint Patrick also proved controversial. Carney had controversial views that Christianity had in fact been an overthrow of the pagan druidic order. The 1955 publication of James Carney's \u2018Studies in Irish Literature and History\u2019 was seen as the beginning point of the late-twentieth century \u2018anti-nativist\u2019 movement. The group for the first time promoted the idea that very little can be known of the earlier oral tradition of the Irish, since all that remains are Christian texts written by Christian clergy and that these clergy were not sympathetic to, but critical of paganism.
