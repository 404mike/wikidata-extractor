In 1943, there was much trade union and student protest across the country against the British Foreign Secretary Herbert Morrison's decision to release Oswald Mosley from prison. For many in the left, Morrison's action was considered a betrayal of the troops fighting fascism across the world.\"Release of Sir Oswald Mosley from Internment\" (1942\u20131943) in Hull History Centre (Ref: U DCL/41/3). One former club member, active in the early-1960s, has spoken of a letter from Herbert Morrison, dated from 1942, justifying his policy to Hull students. It allegedly remained in club executive hands, passed on from member-to-member, although no trace of said letter can now be foundColin Livett, \"Personal Testimony (1961\u20131964)\" in Tom Stephens (ed.), Reddest of the Red Bricks: Labour Student Activism at Hull University (2013), pp. 11-25. and Kevin McNamara has denied ever having seen such a letter when he was active in the club in the 1950s.", "The political economy of Britain, and with it the social basis of Britain's universities, changed after 1945. The first working-class beneficiaries of the 1944 education reforms, with a strong loyalty to the Labour Party, started to study at Hull in the 1950s, and this had consequent effects on left-wing student politics in Hull. Two such beneficiaries of the 1944 education reforms, future Labour MPs Roy Hattersley and Kevin McNamara, arrived at Hull in 1950 to discover a Socialist Society, but no Labour Club, in operation on campus. This Socialist Society was affiliated to the Student Labour Federation (SLF), an offshoot of the ILP's United Front organisations of the 1930s, which sought to bring together various shades of political opinion under a single anti-fascist umbrella. SLF was one of the more successful of these United Front operations and throughout the war, and afterwards, SLF represented all socialist, labour and other student organisations in Britain.Peter Sizer, \"Personal Testimony\" (1952\u20131955) in Tom Stephens (ed), 'The Reddest of the Red Bricks': Labour Student Activism at Hull University (2013), pp. 5-8.", "thumb|A young Kevin McNamara, then Secretary of Hull University students' union, leading a protest of Hull students in Hull city centre against the Franco-British invasion of Suez in 1956.

Thus, in 1952, the bulk of Socialist Society students - led by Roy Hattersley, Kevin McNamara, Fred Moorhouse and Kath Hart - formed the Hull University College Labour Society (Hull didn't become a University until 1954), affiliated to NALSO, as a break-away unit from the Socialist Society. It quickly outgrew the Socialist Society and became the dominant force on campus, playing a key role both in the Hull College Students' Union and NALSO, with Hattersley, Moorhouse and McNamara taking executive positions in both bodies. Hull contributed two NALSO chairmen in the 1950s, Fred Moorhouse (1954\u201355) and Roy Hattersley (1956\u201357); only Oxford, with four chairmen, exceeded Hull\u2019s tally in the early stages of NALSO from 1947 to 1959.

One of the club's key early focuses was on foreign policy, in part because there was broad cross-party consensus on domestic issues, and in part because the club had a sizeable number of Nigerian members, as well as a couple of Cypriots, who accorded a high priority to colonial policy. The club thus hosted many colonial speakers, most notably in 1953, when, jointly with the Socialist Society, it hosted Cheddi Jagan, the deposed Chief Minister of Guyana, in the joint common room of the University Union. Jagan had been dismissed by the Churchill government and army earlier in the year, under American pressure, due to fears of his Marxist sympathies. In 1956, then-Hull University Union Secretary Kevin McNamara led a march against Anthony Eden's invasion of the Suez, in which he was nearly kidnapped, as a joke, by members of the Hull University Conservative Association.
