Kirsty was in a relationship with Tom Archer before he broke up with her for someone else. She then dated Sam Batton, who ended the relationship because he was in love with Ruth Archer. In 2013 Kirsty and Tom got back together and became engaged. He jilted her at the altar. Kirsty was good friends with Tom's sister, Helen, but they fell out when Kirsty discovered that Helen had known before the wedding day that Tom had doubts. She ultimately returned to Ambridge several months later, got a job at Grey Gables and moved in with Roy Tucker while also making amends with Helen and the rest of the family. Her time away meant that she saw clearly the changes in both Helen's appearance and her personality following her marriage to Rob Titchener, which immediately alerted her to the fact that something was off about them and she ended up being the only person to spot the signs that he was abusing her emotionally. Eventually, after persuading Helen to meet Jess, Rob's ex-wife, she was horrified when Helen decided to confront Rob about his behaviour, a confrontation that led to Helen stabbing him. After having a one-night stand with Tom shortly after the trial, Kirsty became pregnant with his son and despite her initial reservations decided to keep the baby. However a couple of weeks later she miscarried. After initially repressing her grief Kirsty eventually agreed to take compassionate leave and grieved properly. Unfortunately Tom\u2019s handling of both the pregnancy and the miscarriage ultimately proved to be the final nail in the coffin of any lingering romantic feelings she had for him.  Kirsty married local builder Phillip Moss, though their relationship was over once it was revealed that his business was viable only through modern slavery."]}, {"page": "The Six Wives of Henry VIII (2001 TV series)", "response": ["*Annabelle Dowler as Catherine of Aragon"]}, {"page": "List of longest-serving soap opera actors", "response": ["| Annabelle Dowler|| Kirsty Miller || The Archers || 1999\u2013 ||  years ||"]}, {"page": "Toby Swift", "response": ["| Dominic West, Shaun Dingwall, Jim Norton, Sasha Pick, Annabelle Dowler, John Guerrasio, John Kay Steel, Joe Montana, Matt Addis, David Hargreaves, Stephen Hogan, Benjamin Askew and Philip Fox"]}, {"page": "Ruth Archer", "response": ["After expanding the dairy herd in May 2004, David and Ruth hired specialist herdsman Sam Batton (Robin Pirongs).Frith 2010, p.200-201.

Ruth found herself becoming jealous when Sam went on holiday with Kirsty. In their book, The Archers Archives, Simon Frith and Chris Arnot commented that the \"simmering mix of sexual chemistry\" between Ruth and Sam reached boiling point when David's ex-girlfriend, Sophie Barlow, returned to Ambridge and asked David to help organise a charity fashion show. Ruth became stressed and insecure about David spending time with his ex-girlfriend and she turned to Sam. The main reason for Ruth's insecurity was her image, as she had recently undergone a mastectomy and felt \"dowdy\" next to Sophie. Ruth became emotionally confused when Sam informed her that he had broken up with Kirsty. She then caught David lying about meeting up with Sophie and believed he was having an affair. Unbeknownst to Ruth, Sophie had tried to entice David into an affair, but he resisted her advances."]}, {"page": "Dowler", "response": ["*Annabelle Dowler (born 1974), English actress"]}, {"page": "Sense8 (season 2)", "response": ["** Annabelle Dowler as Elizabeth"]}, {"page": "My Turn to Make the Tea", "response": ["In 2004 My Turn to Make the Tea  was adapted as a four-part radio serial for BBC Radio 4; the book was adapted for radio by Sheila Goff and was directed by David Hunter.
