This example popularized watercolors as a form of personal tourist journal. The confluence of these cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and amateur interests culminated in the celebration and promotion of watercolor as a distinctly English \"national art\". William Blake published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry, provided illustrations to Dante's Inferno, and he also experimented with large monotype works in watercolor. Among the many other significant watercolorists of this period were Thomas Gainsborough, John Robert Cozens, Francis Towne, Michael Angelo Rooker, William Pars, Thomas Hearne, and John Warwick Smith."]}, {"page": "Ludlow Castle", "response": ["The town of Ludlow was increasingly fashionable and frequented by tourists, with the castle forming a particularly popular attraction. Thomas Warton published an edition of Milton's poems in 1785, describing Ludlow Castle and popularising the links to Comus, reinforcing the castle's reputation as a picturesque and sublime location.;  The castle became a topic for painters interested in these themes: J. M. W. Turner, Francis Towne, Thomas Hearne, Julius Ibbetson, Peter de Wint and William Marlowe all produced depictions of the castle during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, usually taking some artistic licence with the details in order to produce atmospheric works.; "]}, {"page": "William Woollett", "response": ["Thomas Hearne became apprenticed to him in 1765, Woollett came to consider him the finest landscape engraver of his day; he stayed for six years."]}, {"page": "Landscape painting", "response": ["Leading artists included John Robert Cozens, Francis Towne, Thomas Girtin, Michael Angelo Rooker, William Pars, Thomas Hearne, and John Warwick Smith, all in the late 18th century, and  John Glover, Joseph Mallord William Turner, John Varley, John Sell Cotman, Anthony Copley Fielding, Samuel Palmer in the early 19th.See Wilton & Lyles, for all these"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Hearn", "response": ["* Thomas Hearne (antiquarian), English antiquarian", "*Thomas Hearne (artist), landscape painter"]}, {"page": "Leiston Abbey", "response": ["The plan of the ruins taken by Alfred Suckling in 1848 provides an outline of walls still surviving, which can be recognized in views made by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck (1738), Thomas Hearne (engraved 1781), Henry Davy and others.

Despite his openness for romantic poetry, Beaumont was less receptive of new developments in painting. A staunch defender of the academic ethos of Sir Joshua Reynolds, he was one of J. M. W. Turner's most vehement critics, regularly denouncing his handling of colour. This oppressive stance on matters of taste was to earn him the epithet of \"supreme Dictator on Works of Art\" from his old friend Thomas Hearne. Nonetheless, Beaumont did welcome some sympathetic artists, including the young John Constable, to study the Old Masters in his collection. The most famous fruit of Beaumont's patronage is the Constable's painting of the cenotaph erected to Reynolds in the grounds at Coleorton (painted 1833\u20136; now in the National Gallery)."]}, {"page": "St Mary's Abbey, Kenilworth", "response": ["A priory for Augustinian canons was built on this site in about 1124 by Geoffrey de Clinton,Herbert Art Gallery: The Priory Gate at Kenilworth by Thomas Hearne (1784)  Watercolour of the Month: November 2007  which is about the same time as he built Kenilworth Castle.
