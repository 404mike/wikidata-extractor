Featuring \"simple, mostly upbeat songs\" and 1980s new wave influences, the album was noted for its distinctly small list of featured artists compared to previous Gorillaz work, with only two tracks featuring any outside artists (the album's lead single \"Humility\" featuring George Benson and \"Hollywood\" featuring Snoop Dogg and Jamie Principle). Albarn mentioned that the few numbers of featured artists was partially due to the album's quick production, which in turn was a result of Albarn wanting to finish the album before the band's touring schedule resumed: \"We've been very lucky to be offered all the festivals this year on the back of the last record [Humanz]... but I didn't want to do that unless I had something new to work with, so the only option was to make another record really quickly and not have lots of guests on it, because that takes a long time to organize; just do it all myself, really.\" Albarn also explained that with The Now Now he sought to make a Gorillaz album \"where I'm just singing for once\" and that the album is \"pretty much just me singing, very sort of in the world of 2-D.\"", "* James Ford\u00a0\u2013 instrumentation, songwriting, production (2018\u201320)", "  bar:james  text:James Ford"]}, {"page": "Leek, Staffordshire", "response": ["Dave Hill,  Demon discography at Discogs retrieved 6 March 2018 vocalist for English new wave of British heavy metal band Demon, lives in Leek and currently operates rides at Alton Towers.

They received their first mention in a national newspaper in April, with a Daily Star reporter describing them as \"the most exciting band to emerge this year\". They self-released an EP, featuring the single \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\", in May and commenced their first nationwide tour soon afterwards. In June, in the midst of a bidding war, Arctic Monkeys signed to the independent label Domino Recording Company. After initial sessions with James Ford and Mike Crossey, they recorded an album in rural Lincolnshire with producer Jim Abbiss. Turner began dating London-based student Johanna Bennett around this time. In October, the single \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, Arctic Monkeys' debut album, was released in January 2006, and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Turner's lyrics, chronicling teenage nightlife in Sheffield, were widely praised. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times remarked: \"Mr. Turner's lyrics are worth waiting for and often worth memorizing, too ... He has an uncanny way of evoking Northern English youth culture while neither romanticizing it nor sneering at it.\" Musically, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that the album was influenced by guitar bands \"from the past five years ... Thrillingly, their music doesn't sound apologetic for not knowing the intricacies of rock history.\"", "Arctic Monkeys' second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released in April 2007, just over a year after their debut. It was produced in London by Mike Crossey and James Ford. As of 2020, Ford has produced every subsequent Turner project. Lyrically, the album touches on fame, love, and heartache. Turner and Bennett had ended their relationship in January; she was credited as a co-writer on \"Fluorescent Adolescent\". While uninterested in the songs concerning fame, Marc Hogan of Pitchfork said the album displayed Turner's \"usual gift for vivid imagery\" and explored \"new emotional depth\". Petridis of The Guardian noted that the band were \"pushing gently but confidently at the boundaries of their sound\", with hints of \"woozy psychedelia\" and \"piledriving metal\". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while Arctic Monkeys headlined Glastonbury Festival in the summer of 2007. Also that year, Turner began to collaborate with other artists. He worked with rapper Dizzee Rascal on the Arctic Monkeys B-side \"Temptation\", a version of which also featured on Rascal's album Maths and English. He co-wrote three songs on Reverend and The Makers' debut album The State Of Things, after briefly sharing a Sheffield flat with the frontman Jon McClure. Another Sheffield singer, Richard Hawley, featured on the Arctic Monkeys' B-side \"Bad Woman\" and performed with the band at the Manchester Apollo, as part of a concert film directed by Richard Ayoade. Turner also announced plans to form a side-project band, The Last Shadow Puppets, with Ford and Miles Kane, whom he had befriended during a tour in mid-2005.", "While living in Brooklyn, New York, where he moved with Chung in the spring of 2009, Turner wrote an acoustic soundtrack for the coming-of-age feature film Submarine (2010); it was released as an EP in March 2011. Director Richard Ayoade initially approached Turner to sing cover versions but, instead, he recorded six original songs in London, accompanied by James Ford and Bill Ryder-Jones. Two of the songs had already been written; Turner wrote the rest after watching dailies from the film set. The songs existed within the world of the film as a mixtape made by the main character's father. Paul Thompson of Pitchfork felt \"Turner's keen wit and eye for detail\" had created a \"tender portrayal\" of adolescent uncertainty.  Ben Walsh of The Independent said the \"exquisite\" soundtrack was \"reminiscent\" of Cat Stevens's work on Harold and Maude. In 2014, the Submarine soundtrack appeared on The Times's list of 100 Soundtracks to Love. Turner also co-wrote six songs for Miles Kane's debut solo album Colour of the Trap (2011) and co-wrote Kane's standalone single \"First of My Kind\" (2012).", "Turner wrote Arctic Monkeys' fourth album, Suck It and See, in New York and met up with his bandmates and James Ford for recording sessions in Los Angeles. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork enjoyed the album's \"chiming indie pop balladry\" and \"muscular glam-rock\". Petridis of The Guardian remarked that Turner's new lyrical style of \"dense, Dylanesque wordplay is tough to get right. More often than not, he pulls it off. There are beautifully turned phrases and piercing observation.\" Richard Hawley co-wrote and provided vocals for the B-side, \"You and I\", and performed the song with the band at the Olympia in Paris. Turner joined Elvis Costello on stage in New York to sing \"Lipstick Vogue\".", "Columbia Records approached Turner about working with Alexandra Savior in 2014, and he co-wrote her debut album, Belladonna of Sadness, in between Arctic Monkeys' touring commitments. Turner and James Ford co-produced the album in 2015, with Turner also playing bass, guitars, keyboards, and synthesisers. An additional song \"Risk\" was recorded with T Bone Burnett for an episode of the crime drama True Detective. While Turner and Savior performed together in Los Angeles in 2016, the album was not released until April 2017. In reviewing it, Hilary Hughes of Pitchfork remarked: \"Turner's musical ticks are so distinct that they're instantly recognizable when someone else tries to dress them up as their own.\" Savior later said the press attention surrounding Turner's involvement was overwhelming: \"I'm so grateful for him, but I'm also like, 'Alright, alright!'\"", "Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, Arctic Monkeys' sixth album, was released in May 2018. After receiving a Steinway Vertegrand piano as a 30th birthday present from his manager, Turner wrote the space-themed album from the perspective of \"a lounge-y character\". He recorded demos at home, alone and later with Helders, and shared them with Cook in early 2017. Cook was initially taken-aback by the change in direction but was \"very, very excited by what he'd come up with.\" By mid\u20132017, the whole band was recording the project, produced by Turner and James Ford, in both Los Angeles and France. They were joined by musicians from the bands Tame Impala, Klaxons, and Mini Mansions. Upon release, Jonah Weiner of Rolling Stone characterised Tranquility Base as \"a captivatingly bizarre album about the role of entertainment \u2013 the desire to escape into it, and the desire to create it \u2013 during periods of societal upheaval and crisis.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it \"quietly impressive\" that the band chose to release the \"thrilling, smug, clever and oddly cold album\" rather than more crowd-pleasing fare. Jazz Monroe of Pitchfork declared it \"a delirious and artful satire directed at the foundations of modern society.\" The album became the eighth number one album of Turner's career in the UK. The band toured the album from May 2018 to April 2019."]}, {"page": "Test Icicles", "response": ["According to the NME, Domino Recording Company signed Test Icicles near sight-unseen. This probably explains the label's surprise and suggested re-working of initial album material completed by the band.

Following the release of the album in October 2005, the band toured the United States with Art Brut before returning to Europe for additional performances."]}, {"page": "Making Dens", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by James Ford (musician)"]}]}}
