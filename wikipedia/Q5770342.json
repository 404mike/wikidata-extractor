John Harrison, a Baptist minister, after having been thrown out for non-payment of rent. In November 1885, he got lost on an excursion and was found after several days \"in a state of hypothermia sheltering inside a roofless building next to St. Catherine's Oratory and afterwards developed pneumonia\". He found dead in his room on 7 February 1886, and was buried in the graveyard of the local Church of England church on 10 February. His grave remained unmarked until 1902 when his biographer Thomas Greenwood paid his debts and erected a monument over his grave."]}, {"page": "Thomas Greenwood", "response": ["Thomas Greenwood may refer to:", "* Thomas Greenwood (activist) (1908\u20131988), American labor and Indian affairs activist", "* Thomas Greenwood (historian) (1790\u20131871), English barrister and academic", "* Thomas Greenwood (publisher) (1851\u20131908), English publisher"]}, {"page": "Cornelius Sherlock", "response": ["Sherlock's work for Sir James Picton on extending the William Brown Library followed the opening of the Walker Art Gallery, and the Picton Reading Room opened in 1879. Sherlock's design, modelled on the Pantheon in Rome, was critically acclaimed. His choice of a Classical rotunda surrounded by a colonnade of Corinthian columns is considered a graceful solution to turn the corner of the street, and together with the Walker gallery and the Brown library, the Picton forms part of a Neoclassical ensemble that was acclaimed by the public library advocate Thomas Greenwood as \"without doubt the finest pile of buildings for this purpose in the whole United Kingdom and Ireland\"."]}]}}
