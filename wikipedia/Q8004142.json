He was a left-handed batsman who played first-class cricket for Northamptonshire. He was born in Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire and died in Ashton, Northamptonshire.\nAdams had represented Buckinghamshire on six occasions in the Minor Counties Championship from 1911 to 1913, making his debut as an opening order batsman but moving down the order upon several substandard batting performances.\nAdams did not play another cricket match until the 1920 season, when he made his County Championship debut at the age of 35 for Northamptonshire, batting extensively throughout the next two seasons, though the team would struggle for decent form in the two years in which he played. Following the close of the 1921 season, Adams spent five years out of the game, returning in an innings victory against Dublin University in 1926.\nAdams played regularly in the County Championship during 1927, though Northamptonshire had still made little progress in the league, finishing second bottom. Over the next two years, before making his exit from the game, Adams played just two first-class games, quitting in 1929.\nHe scored 2 first-class centuries, with a best of 154 not out against Hampshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Adams", "response": ["William Adams may refer to:", "*William Adams (Royal Navy officer, died 1748), British naval officer", "*William Adams (Royal Navy officer, born 1716) (1716\u20131763), British naval officer", "*William Adams (pilot) (1564\u20131620), English sailor and samurai in Japan", "*Willy Northpole (William Adams, born 1980), rapper signed to Ludacris' DTP Records", "*William Adams (British Columbia politician) (1851\u20131936), rancher and politician in British Columbia, Canada", "*William Adams (1752\u20131811), MP for Totnes", "*William Adams (New Zealand politician) (1811\u20131884), New Zealand politician", "*William Adams (locomotive engineer) (1823\u20131904), British locomotive engineer", "*William Adams (Master of Pembroke) (1706/7\u20131789), English scholar", "*William Adams (oculist) (1783\u20131827), English ophthalmic surgeon", "*William Adams (cricketer) (1885\u20131957), English cricketer", "*William Adams (footballer), footballer who played for Walsall and West Bromwich Albion", "*William Adams (wrestler), British wrestler", "*William Adams (author) (1814\u20131848), English religious writer", "*William Adams (Dedham) (1650\u20131685), minister of the First Church and Parish in Dedham", "*William Adams (minister) (1807\u20131880), American religious leader and college president", "*William Adams (haberdasher) (1585\u20131661), London haberdasher and founder of Adams' Grammar School", "*William Adams (lawyer) (1772\u20131851), English lawyer, helped negotiate settlements with the US c.1814/1815", "*William Adams (potter) (c. 1746\u20131805), North Staffordshire potter, founded the Greengates Pottery", "*William Adams (mining engineer) (1813\u20131876)", "*William Adams (lifesaver) (1864\u20131913), English lifesaver from Gorleston"]}, {"page": "Charles Addis", "response": ["Addis's second and final first-class appearance came against the very same team almost exactly two years later, with the same end result, thanks to century innings from team-mates William Adams and John Timms.
