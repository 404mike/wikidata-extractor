Notable guitarists to adopt this hardware are Ani DiFranco, Doyle Dykes, Don Ross, and Richard Smith.", "Fingerstyle jazz on the electric guitar was pioneered by George van Eps (1913\u20131998) who was respected for his polyphonic approach, sometimes using a seven string guitar. Wes Montgomery (1925\u20131968) was known for using the fleshy part of his thumb to provide the bass line while strumming chordal or melodic motives with his fingers. This style, while unorthodox, was widely regarded as an innovative method for enhancing the warm tone associated with jazz guitar. Montgomery's influence extends to modern polyphonic jazz improvisational methods. Joe Pass (1929\u20131994) switched to fingerstyle mid career, making the Virtuoso series of albums. Little known to the general public Ted Greene (1946\u20132005) was admired by fellow musicians for his harmonic skills. Lenny Breau (1941\u20131984) went one better than van Eps by playing virtuosic fingerstyle on an eight string guitar. Tommy Crook replaced the lower two strings on his Gibson switchmaster with bass strings, allowing him to create the impression of playing bass and guitar simultaneously. Chet Atkins (1924\u20132001) sometimes applied his formidable right-hand technique to jazz standards, with Duck Baker (b. 1949), Richard Smith (b. 1971), Woody Mann and Tommy Emmanuel (b. 1955), among others, following in his footsteps. They use the fingerpicking technique of Merle Travis and others to play wide variety of material including jazz. This style is distinguished by having a steadier and \"busier\" (several beats to the bar) bass line than the chord melody approach of Montgomery and Pass making it suited to up-tempo material."]}, {"page": "List of people from Beckenham", "response": ["*Richard Smith (born 1971), fingerstyle guitarist"]}, {"page": "Pat Bergeson", "response": ["Bergeson is also a member of the Hot Club of Nashville with renowned fiddler Stuart Duncan and guitarist Richard Smith among others.", "* Country Gentleman \u2013 A Tribute To Chet Atkins feat.
