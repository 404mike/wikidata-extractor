The following year, he moved to Merseyside, where he turned out for amateur team Graysons of Garston of the West Cheshire Association Football League, an amateur side that represented a local shipping company, whilst also working for the company. Beadles often commented on his role at the company to family members, believing he was only employed due to his footballing skills as he would spend most working days making tea. In June 1921, he signed for Liverpool, one of the leading teams in the country at the time, along with teammate Danny Shone."]}, {"page": "Shone (surname)", "response": ["*Danny Shone (born 1899),  English association footballer who played as a striker for Liverpool F.C."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Loughlin", "response": ["At the beginning of January 1929, he and teammate Danny Shone were sold to Coventry City of the Third Division South for what were described as substantial fees. According to the Coventry Evening Telegraph, it was Loughlin's \"desire to get a chance in League football which was the deciding factor in inducing him to come to Coventry.\" Loughlin made his debut in a 3\u20130 win against Brighton & Hove Albion, and the following week, at home to Fulham, converted a cross from Ernie Toseland to open the scoring after half an hour, but Coventry were unable to retain their lead and lost 2\u20131. He scored twice in the next match, away to Exeter City. The first was a tap-in after Toseland's shot rebounded to him off the goalpost, the second, to clinch a 3\u20131 win, came from a solo run in which he dribbled past centre-half, both backs and the goalkeeper to walk the ball into the net. He missed only one match in what remained of the season, with a thigh injury in February. His form varied, as did that of the team, and he finished the campaign with eight goals from 19 league appearancesonly two players scored more."]}]}}
