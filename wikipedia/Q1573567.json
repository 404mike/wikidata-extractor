In Central and Northern Europe Imlach enjoyed a strong reputation as a vivid live artist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Martyn", "response": ["Mentored by Hamish Imlach, Martyn began his professional musical career when he was 17, playing a fusion of blues and folk resulting in a distinctive style which made him a key figure in the British folk scene during the mid-1960s.

Joseph saw several of Connolly's performances and noted his comedic skills. Joseph had nurtured the recording career of another Scottish folk entertainer, Hamish Imlach, and saw potential in Connolly following a similar path. He suggested to Connolly that he drop the folk-singing and focus primarily on becoming a comedian."]}, {"page": "Motherwell", "response": ["* Hamish Imlach \u2013 folk singer; lived in Muirhouse, Motherwell"]}, {"page": "Transatlantic Records", "response": ["* Hamish Imlach"]}, {"page": "Music of Scotland", "response": ["The history of the guitar in traditional music is recent, as is that of the cittern and bouzouki introduced into Celtic folk music by folksinger Johnny Moynihan in the late 1960s.O'Toole, Leagues (2006).

F. Schwartz, How Britain Got the Blues: The Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom (Aldershot Ashgate, 2007), pp, 65\u20136. Beside the many later jazz, blues, pop and rock musicians that started performing in skiffle bands were a number of future folk performers, including Martin Carthy and John Renbourn. It also brought a greater familiarity with American roots music and helped expand the British folk club movement where American folk music also began to be played and which were an important part of the second revival. This started in London where MacColl began the Ballads and Blues Club in 1953. These clubs usually met in urban locations, but the songs sung in them often harked back to a rural pre-industrial past. In many ways this was the adoption of abandoned popular music by the middle classes. By the mid-1960s there were probably over 300 folk clubs in Britain, providing an important circuit for acts that performed traditional songs and tunes acoustically, where some could sustain a living by playing to a small but committed audience. Some clubs developed policies around their musical preferences and which artists they would book. These ranged from \"the rural idyll\" through \"anything which entertains\" to \"stick to your own culture,\" the latter meaning \"if you're British don't copy American songs and styles.\" Artists such as Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger refused to confine themselves to rural or even early industrial songs, but wrote or brought burning political issues into their repertoire.  Other artists who built a reputation performing traditional songs in British clubs included English singers the Copper Family, The Watersons, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, Shirley Collins and Martin Carthy,S.
