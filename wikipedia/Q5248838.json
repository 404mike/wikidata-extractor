She noticed that the Green Party office was in Clapham, where she was living at the time, so thought: \"Right! I'm going there now, I'm just going to dedicate the rest of my life to this party'.\" Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987\u201389) and Co-Chair (1989\u201390). In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: \"when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be focusing on what you look like but on what you're saying\".", "Lucas was elected as the Green Party's first leader on 5 September 2008, gaining 92% of the vote (against one other candidate, Ashley Gunstock) on a turnout of 38%. Previously the party had operated under a collective leadership. The change \"was about having a face the country recognises - or hopefully\", she told Decca Aitkenhead in 2009, \"comes to recognise. It was in recognition of the fact that people don't really relate to abstract ideas, they relate more to the people who embody them.\" Lucas was elected as the Green Party's first-ever MP (for Brighton Pavilion) at the general election of 2010."]}, {"page": "Respect Party", "response": ["Respect made \"rapid progress\", aided by growing finances and the existing campaign experience of the far left.

Galloway, however, told Decca Aitkenhead in April 2012 for a Guardian profile that Respect, at its peak, only had about 3\u20134,000 members.

Saunders recorded her entire role in only four days over the course of one year. The actress found working on an animated film to be liberating and found the experience to have several advantages as an actor, describing voice acting as a \"perfect\" career \"because you get all these perks ... but you don't have to do any of that other, you know, filming ... no one's going to say, 'That movie didn't work because Jennifer Saunders' voice wasn't good'\". Saunders concluded that performing in Shrek 2 \"has been one of my favourite jobs in the world\", additionally appreciating that critics and viewers were not able to judge her physical appearance. Saunders recorded her dialogue solely opposite director Andrew Adamson, who temporarily fulfilled all other characters' roles during Saunders' sessions. Saunders elaborated, \"You feel that you've just done some stuff, and they then go away and pull it all apart and make this fantastic thing. Everyone in the cast has the same experience of the film ... It's like you haven't really been in it\". Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian believes that Saunders \"must have been the obvious choice for the producers of Shrek 2, for this ambiguous sensibility is the very essence of the film - a Hollywood send-up of Hollywood\". At Saunders' request, the filmmakers allowed her to record a line of her character promising to return despite her death scene, as Saunders insisted that they would surely want to bring back Fairy Godmother in further installments, but the decision to kill off the character remained.", "The Washington Post's Michael O'Sullivan wrote that Saunders \"brings a deliciously nasty edge to her role\". Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net wrote that the actress \"delivers a fine performance\", concluding, \"If you liked her in Absolutely Fabulous, you\u2019ll enjoy her in Shrek 2.\" Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat observed that Saunders \"seems to enjoy giving voice to the Fairy Godmother\", preferring her over Charming. Kevin Lally of Film Journal International wrote that Saunders steals \"the rest of the show ... bringing her Absolutely Fabulous haughtiness and wicked wit to the role\", while Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail reviewed Fairy Godmother as some of Saunders' best work, hailing her character's entrance as \"a gorgeous piece of animation\". Also comparing Fairy Godmother to Saunders' Absolutely Fabulous character Edina Monsoon, The Guardian journalist Decca Aitkenhead described her as \"an ambitious fag hag who bullies the royals as if they were her family in Ab Fab\", believing that her performance, humor and delivery can only be rivaled by Eddie Murphy's Donkey. Variety film critic Todd McCarthy wrote that Saunders did \"her best to elevate\" the film via a performance he described as \"worthy of the most cunning storybook characters.\" McCarthy also identified the addition of musical numbers to Saunders' performance as a bonus. Logan Raschke of The Daily Eastern News concluded the character \"wouldn't be who she is if it wasn't for Jennifer Saunders (and fantastic writing)\", describing the actress's portrayal as \"stern, controlled and yet gentle when need be.\" The A.
