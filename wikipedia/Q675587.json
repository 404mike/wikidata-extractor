He has also played with the Cult, Ultravox, From the Jam, Procol Harum, Rick Astley, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Roger Daltrey, Fish, Steve Harley, Howard Jones, Nik Kershaw, the Pretenders, Thunderclap Newman, Tiffany, Midge Ure, Pete Townshend and many others. Brzezicki was also the sole drummer on Shine, the second (and final, to date) English-language studio album by Swedish singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad of ABBA. He uses both the traditional and matched grips.\nHe is the son of an English mother and a Polish veteran of the Second World War. Brzezicki left Big Country in July 1989, but rejoined in 1993. He, together with bassist Tony Butler and guitarist Bruce Watson, began gigging again as Big Country in 2007, as part of their 25th anniversary tour.\nIn 2004, Brzezicki helped found a new band, Casbah Club, with Bruce Foxton and Simon Townshend.\nSmash Hits magazine had a running gag in the 1980s wherein they referred to the drummer as \"Mark Unpronounceablename of Big Country\". On Pete Townshend's All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes and White City: A Novel albums, there are joking references to the spelling of Brzezicki's last name.\nHis brother Steve is a session bassist with whom he frequently collaborates.\nOn 10 October 2009, Mark Brzezicki rejoined the Cult onstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He joined original members Ian Astbury, Billy Duffy and Jamie Stewart, with whom he had recorded their Love (1985) album, to perform \"The Phoenix\" and \"She Sells Sanctuary\" as a second and final encore to a live performance of Love.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fish (singer)", "response": ["Fish\u2019s debut solo album Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors was released in January 1990.
