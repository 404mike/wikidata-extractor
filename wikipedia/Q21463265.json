Friedman gifted much of his collection to institutions, often local. For example, a painting by Percy Hague Jowett is held in the collection of The Stanley and Audrey Burton Gallery, University of Leeds and he made other generous donations to Leeds Museums & Galleries Collection and that of the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art was another recipient of Friedman's largesse."]}]}}
