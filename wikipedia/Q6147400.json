Torquay dominated the early stages of the game with Jack making a number of runs.  After 19 minutes, McFarlane struck the ball into the net but the goal was disallowed for offside. Midway through the first half, Steve Forbes tried to lift the ball over Torquay's Gittens but the ball struck the defender's arm and the referee awarded a penalty.   David Gregory struck the spot-kick into the Torquay goal off the left-hand goalpost having sent the Torquay goalkeeper Gregg the wrong way.  Nine minutes later, Neil Gregory was unmarked in the Torquay penalty area but shot wide.  Just before half-time, Gittens struck the ball over the bar from  after a shot was blocked on the goal-line by Jamie Robinson.  Soon after the interval Simon Betts struck a shot from around  which went under Gregg's body and wide of the post.  Forbes was then prevented from shooting when he was tackled after beating three defenders.  Torquay began to dominate once again although Colchester were denied a penalty after Gibbs had brought down David Gregory.  Torquay then missed numerous chances to score:  a strike from Gibbs was deflected wide, Gittens headed the ball over the bar and Jack shot wide.  In the 71st minute, Emberson pushed Andy Gurney's shot round the post.  Seven minutes later, Mark Sale's header from Joe Dunne's cross was straight at Gregg and the match ended 1\u20130 with Colchester being promoted to the Second Division.", "|DF ||4||Jamie Robinson"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jamie Robinson"]}]}}
