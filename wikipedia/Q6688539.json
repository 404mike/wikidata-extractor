Charles Corbett strongly supported votes for women. He was a partisan in Parliament of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and a vigorous campaigner outside. In 1913 he helped to form the East Grinstead branch of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage. . Like her husband and her famous daughter, Marie Corbett was more radical on women's suffrage issues than the mainstream WLF.  She was a friend of Louisa Martindale and close to other Liberal feminists. In 1904, with Margery and her other daughter Cicely, she travelled to Berlin to attend an International Women's\u2019 Suffrage conference and in 1907, again with Margery, she left the WLF to form the Liberal Women's Suffrage Group.Cheryl Law, Women: A Modern Political Dictionary; I B Tauris, 2000 pp. 44-45 The Corbett family's opinions and campaigning on the question of votes for women often attracted hostility in the traditionally conservative area of East Grinstead.Anne Commire, Deborah Klezmer, Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia; Yorkin Publications, 2000 p112 Marie and her two feminist daughters were among those such as Helen MacRae, Lilla Durham, and Mary Sackville who founded the East Grinstead Suffrage Society associated with the Women's Social and Political Union suffragettes and often made public speeches on the subject of women's rights in East Grinstead High Street. At one time the group were pelted with rotten food on a parade in the town. East Grinstead was traditionally a safe Conservative seat and the crowds were usually very hostile. A survey carried out in 1911 suggested that less than 20% of the women in East Grinstead supported women having the vote in parliamentary elections.  This may have been one factor in Charles Corbett's loss of his seat in the January 1910 general election where the Tory candidate was said to have inflicted a crushing defeat.The Times, 29 January 1910 p9"]}, {"page": "St Giles' Church, Horsted Keynes", "response": ["The Martindale Centre, named after Louisa Martindale, is used as the church office and parish hall.
