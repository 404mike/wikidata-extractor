Over the course of the next 11 years, Smith blended \"nature photography with painstaking laboratory work,\" on the series, \"providing an atmospheric account of British wildlife,\" which filmmaker, historian and critic Paul Rotha described in 1930 as \"the sheet anchor of the British film industry.\" He later went on to work for Gaumont-British Instructional Films on the similar Secrets of Life series, where he made the controversial A Family of Great Tits (1934), highlighting the brutality of nature with footage from a specially constructed nesting box. Working until 1947, he made over 50 films many of which showed animal behaviour that had never before been recorded."]}, {"page": "Edgar P.

Pike, featuring the nesting habits of the common cuckoo, which changed public perception of how the birds reproduce. Chance asked local children to watch nests around Pound Green Common so he could work out the ones the cuckoo was most likely to visit next and thus instruct Pike as to where to position his cameras to catch the best shots. The resulting footage provided the first documented proof that the birds lay their eggs directly in the nests of the species they parasitise, rather than laying them on the ground and carrying them to the nest, and inaugurated the new film series.
