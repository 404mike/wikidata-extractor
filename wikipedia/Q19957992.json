Buzzfeed reported Johnson had been in contact with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former chief adviser.

In January 2019, Johnson came under criticism for remarks he had made during the 2016 Leave campaign regarding the prospect of Turkish accession to the European Union; he denied making such remarks. In March 2019, Johnson said that expenditure on investigating historic allegations of child abuse, instead of more police on the streets, was money \"spaffed up the wall\".
