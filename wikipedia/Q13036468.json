They are credited with reviving the popularity of modern dancing.  Castle was a stage name: Vernon (2 May 1887 \u2013 15 February 1918) was born William Vernon Blyth in Norwich, Norfolk, England.  Irene (7 April 1893 \u2013 25 January 1969) was born Irene Foote in New Rochelle, New York.\nThe couple reached the peak of their popularity in Irving Berlin's first Broadway show, Watch Your Step (1914), in which they refined and popularized the Foxtrot.  They also helped to promote ragtime, jazz rhythms and African-American music for dance.  Irene became a fashion icon through her appearances on stage and in early movies, and both Castles were in demand as teachers and writers on dance.\nAfter serving with distinction as a pilot in the British Royal Flying Corps during World War I, Vernon died in a plane crash on a flight training base near Fort Worth, Texas, in 1918.  Irene continued to perform solo in Broadway, vaudeville and motion picture productions over the next decade.  She remarried three times, had children and became an animal-rights activist.  In 1939, her life with Vernon was dramatized in  The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1918", "response": ["* February 15 \u2013 Vernon Castle, American dancer (b. 1887)"]}, {"page": "1887", "response": ["** Vernon Castle, British dancer (d. 1918)"]}, {"page": "1912 in music", "response": ["* The Lady of the Slipper Broadway production opened at the Globe Theatre on October 28 and ran for 232 performances.
