Around 1813 he tried portrait painting, generally small full-lengths with landscape backgrounds using no body-colour. As a watercolour painter, Cristall gained an honourable position from the freedom and simplicity of his style and manner of execution. Five of his drawings (including The Young Fisher-Boy and The Fish Market on Hastings Beach) are in the South Kensington Museum. Cristall was an early member of the Sketching Society. He also furnished some of the classical figures in Barret's landscapes and some groups in George Fennell Robson's Scotch Scenery."]}, {"page": "Robert Hills", "response": ["Hills was known to draw animals in works of other artists, such as George Barret, Jr. and George Fennell Robson.
