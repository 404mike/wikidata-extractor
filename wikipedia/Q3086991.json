Lines of small children begging stretched for miles outside cities; at night, children could be heard \"crying bitterly and coughing terribly ... in the pouring monsoon rain ... stark naked, homeless, motherless, fatherless and friendless. Their sole possession was an empty tin\". A schoolteacher in Mahisadal witnessed \"children picking and eating undigested grains out of a beggar's diarrheal discharge\". Author Freda Bedi wrote that it was \"not just the problem of rice and the availability of rice. It was the problem of society in fragments\".", "Beginning in mid-July 1943 and more so in August, however, these two newspapers began publishing detailed and increasingly critical accounts of the depth and scope of the famine, its impact on society, and the nature of British, Hindu, and Muslim political responses. A turning point in news coverage came in late August 1943, when the editor of The Statesman, Ian Stephens, solicited and published a series of graphic photos of the victims. These made world headlines and marked the beginning of domestic and international consciousness of the famine. The next morning, \"in Delhi second-hand copies of the paper were selling at several times the news-stand price,\" and soon \"in Washington the State Department circulated them among policy makers\". In Britain, The Guardian called the situation \"horrible beyond description\". The images had a profound effect and marked \"for many, the beginning of the end of colonial rule\". Stephens' decision to publish them and to adopt a defiant editorial stance won accolades from many (including the Famine Inquiry Commission), and has been described as \"a singular act of journalistic courage without which many more lives would have surely been lost\". The publication of the images, along with Stephens' editorials, not only helped to bring the famine to an end by driving the British government to supply adequate relief to the victims, but also inspired Amartya Sen's influential contention that the presence of a free press prevents famines in democratic countries. The photographs also spurred Amrita Bazar Patrika and the Indian Communist Party's organ, People's War, to publish similar images; the latter would make photographer Sunil Janah famous. Women journalists who covered the famine included Freda Bedi reporting for Lahore's The Tribune, and Vasudha Chakravarti and Kalyani Bhattacharjee, who wrote from a nationalist perspective."]}, {"page": "Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa", "response": ["In 1974, with the help of Freda Bedi, he embarked on his first world tour.
