His father, John Edmund Bentley, was professionally a civil servant but was also a rugby union international having played in the first ever international match for England against Scotland in 1871. Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including The Daily Telegraph. He also worked for the imperialist weekly called The Outlook during the editorship of James Louis Garvin.  His first published collection of poetry, titled Biography for Beginners (1905), popularized the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, More Biography (1929) and Baseless Biography (1939). His detective novel Trent's Last Case (1913)Trent's Last Case,  was much praised, numbering Dorothy L. Sayers among its admirers, and with its labyrinthine and mystifying plotting can be seen as the first truly modern mystery. It was adapted as a film in 1920, 1929, and 1952. The success of the work inspired him, after 23 years, to write a sequel, Trent's Own Case (1936). There was also a book of Trent short stories, Trent Intervenes (1938)."]}, {"page": "John Bentley", "response": ["*John Edmund Bentley (1847\u20131913), English rugby international"]}, {"page": "Gipsies Football Club", "response": ["*John Edmund Bentley - capped 1871 and 1872"]}, {"page": "1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match", "response": ["England: A.
