However, during the 1960s, historians such as John Terraine began to challenge that interpretation. In recent years, as new documents have come forth and the passage of time has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as Gary D. Sheffield and Richard Holmes observe that the military leadership of the British Army on the Western Front had to cope with many problems that they could not control, such as a lack of adequate military communications, which had not occurred. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war, culminating in the Hundred Days Offensive advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely but are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers."]}, {"page": "Battle of Passchendaele", "response": ["Leon Wolff, writing in 1958, gave German casualties as  and British casualties as  Wolff's British figure was refuted by John Terraine in a 1977 publication.

In Chapter 89, he poured scorn on Haig's recently published diaries (clearly \"carefully edited\" by Duff Cooper) describing Haig as \"intellectually and temperamentally unequal to his task\" and \"second-rate\" (compared to Foch, p.\u00a02014), although \"above the average for his profession\u2014perhaps more in industry than intelligence\". He attributed his own \"distrust of his capacity to fill such an immense position\" to Haig's lack of a clear grasp even of the Western Front (likening him to \"the blind King of Bohemia at Crecy\"), let alone the needs of other fronts and his inability, given his preference for being surrounded by courteous \"gentlemen\", to select good advisers. He also criticised Haig for lacking the personal magnetism of a great commander, for his intrigues against his predecessor Sir John French, his willingness to scapegoat Hubert Gough, for the defeat of March 1918 (although he had actually defended him and the alternative would probably have been Haig's own dismissal) and his claims to have subsequently accepted the appointment of Foch as Allied Generalissimo, which Lloyd George claimed that Haig had opposed. On another occasion he is said to have described Haig as \"brilliant \u2013 to the top of his boots\".Laffin 1988, p. 162. Lloyd George's biographer John Grigg (2002) attributed his vitriol to a guilty conscience, that he had not intervened to put a stop to the Passchendaele Offensive. John Terraine, writing of the \"shrill venom\" with which Lloyd George sought to \"exculpate himself\", also found some \"faint stirring of consciousness\" of how he had destroyed trust between politicians and soldiers by the Nivelle Affair (making it impossible for Robertson to raise his concerns about the Battle of Passchendaele with the Prime Minister) and called the memoirs \"a document as shabby as his behaviour at Calais\".Terraine 1977, p. 341.", "One of Haig's defenders was the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (The Educated Soldier) in 1963, in which Haig was portrayed as a \"Great Captain\" of the calibre of the Duke of Marlborough or the Duke of Wellington. Terraine, taking his cue from Haig's \"Final Despatch\" of 1918, also argued that Haig pursued the only strategy possible, given the situation the armies were in: that of attrition which wore down the German army and delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce of 1918. Gary Sheffield stated that although Terraine's arguments about Haig have been much attacked over forty years, Terraine's thesis \"has yet to be demolished\".", "Haig has been criticised for the high casualties in British offensives, but it has been argued by historians like John Terraine that this was largely a function of the size of the battles, as British forces engaged the main body of the German Army on the Western Front after 1916.Terraine 1980, pp. 37, 105, 108 Although total deaths in the Second World War were far higher than in the First, British deaths were lower, because Britain fought mainly peripheral campaigns in the Mediterranean for much of the Second World War, involving relatively few British troops, while most of the land fighting took place between Germany and the USSR (the Soviets suffered roughly as many dead in the Second World War, not including civilians, as every country in the First World War combined).Corrigan 2002, p. 70. When British forces engaged in Normandy in 1944, total losses were fewer than on the Somme in 1916, as Normandy was around half the length and less than half the size but casualties per unit per week were broadly similar.Corrigan 2002, pp. 298\u2013300, 408.

Kitchener, angry that Wilson had acted without consulting him, summoned him to his office for a rebuke. Wilson was angry that Kitchener was confusing the mobilisation plans by deploying troops from Aldershot to Grimsby in case of German invasion, and recorded in his diary that \"I answered back as I have no intention of being bullied by him especially when he talks such nonsense \u2026 the man is a fool \u2026 He is a d---- fool\". On Huguet's return (12 August) he met with French, Murray and Wilson. They agreed to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, but Kitchener, in a three-hour meeting which was, according to Wilson, \"memorable in showing K's colossal ignorance and conceit\", tried to insist on a deployment to Amiens where the BEF would be in less danger of being overrun by the Germans coming north of the Meuse.Jeffery 2006, pp. 133\u20134. Wilson wrote not just of the difficulties and delays which Kitchener was making but also of \"the cowardice of it\", although historian John Terraine later argued that Kitchener's opposition to a forward deployment was proven entirely correct by the nearness which the BEF came to disaster.Terraine 1960, p. 40.

Haig may well have chosen Gough to spearhead Third Ypres because his aggression and preference to attack \"at the hurroush\" contrasted with the more cautious tactics favoured by Rawlinson and Plumer, and perhaps also because his inexperience and lack of knowledge of the Ypres Salient made him more willing to do Haig's bidding.In January 1917 Plumer had been asked to prepare plans to \"attack with rapidity and push through quickly\". Rawlinson was Haig's next choice to command Third Ypres, but Haig wrote in the margin of his proposals \"our objective is to break through rapidly\".
