Following building speculation, the county team moved across the River Itchen to Day's Antelope Ground, although the building proposal fell through and so Hampshire returned across the river to the Antelope Ground. Hampshire County Cricket Club, formed in September 1863, became tenants. In 1883, James Fellowes began negotiations for the lease and development of  land in Northlands Road which formed part of the Hulse estate. With an agreement reached between Hampshire County Cricket Club and the estate, Hampshire played their final match at the Antelope Ground in August 1884 and moved to Northlands Road for the 1885 season."]}, {"page": "Antelope Ground", "response": ["In 1883, Col.

Speaking in 1999, Carter's daughter-in-law, Nellie Carter, said that Carter was \"not at all happy\" about being posted to Southampton and that Carter maintained that the move was arranged by Dr. Russell Bencraft who was medical officer at the Ordnance Survey and was later to become the president of Southampton St. Mary's F.C. As secretary of the Hampshire County Cricket Club, Bencraft was also a colleague of Col. James Fellowes, who was an assistant to the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey. It would seem, therefore, that Carter was transferred to Southampton as a quasi-professional footballer."]}, {"page": "Harry Thornber", "response": ["Thornber played his club cricket for Manchester and Sale, before making his appearance in first-class cricket for Lancashire in 1874 against Kent at Maidstone.
