About two brothers in south-east London, the series was in many ways a forerunner to Only Fools And Horses, only Jason was in the more dopey 'Rodney' role with Peter Armitage playing the cleverer of the two. The brothers drove around in a comical bubble car, a precursor to the famous Trotters' van; and there was even the joke where, just as he was trying to impress the girl (Cheryl Hall), Jason casually leaned back against the bar, without his knowing that barman had just lifted it behind his back, and fell through. This situation was re-enacted in Only Fools And Horses. He played the lead role of Peter Barnes in the ATV sitcom A Sharp Intake of Breath (1977\u201381), alongside Alun Armstrong and Richard Wilson. In 1979, he appeared as Buttons in the pantomime Cinderella at Newcastle's Theatre Royal, starring Leah Bell and Bobby Thompson, produced by Michael Grayson and directed by John Blackmore."]}, {"page": "Survivors (1975 TV series)", "response": ["* Cheryl Hall as Mavis (eps. 3, 5)"]}, {"page": "Citizen Smith", "response": ["*Cheryl Hall as Shirley Johnson (series 1\u20132)", "From episode three, \"Abide with Me\", Wolfie Smith (Robert Lindsay) lives, with his religious, teetotal friend Ken Mills (Mike Grady), in a flat in the house of his girlfriend's family\u2014Shirley Johnson (Cheryl Hall, at the time Lindsay's wife); her affable but na\u00efve mother, Florence, who mistakenly calls Wolfie \"Foxy\"; and her strict, right-wing father, Charlie, who disapproves of Smith's lifestyle and refers to him as a \"flaming yeti\" or \"Chairman Mao\".
