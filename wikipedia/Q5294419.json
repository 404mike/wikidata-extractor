The structure was the subject of a limited competition between three selected Australian architects and three selected British architects. Assessors of the competition were Lord Holford, Sir Donald Gibson and Sir John Overall (Chairman of the National Capital Development Commission). The winners were the Western Australian firm of Cameron Chisholm Nicol. The Carillon was designed in 1967, built during 1969 and completed in 1970. The three columns of the design symbolise the British and Australian Governments and the City of Canberra. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the National Carillon on 26 April 1970. The Carillon has a symbolic value in the link between Britain and Australia. It also has some historic value for its association with the commemoration of the 50th Jubilee of the founding of Canberra. The tower stands  tall. The concept was developed in 1968 by Don Ho, an architect at Cameron Chisholm Nicol. The carillon bells and mechanism were designed and constructed by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough.

Its cramped medieval streets were becoming dangerously congested and overcrowded, and in 1938 the City Council appointed Donald Gibson to become the first city architect.

To cope with a rapidly growing population, the city council tasked city engineer Ernest Ford with modernising the roads; he went on to build Corporation Street and Trinity Street, projects which involved large-scale demolition and relocation of residents. Donald Gibson was appointed city architect in 1939 and began work on a city centre redevelopment plan more radical than Ford's. After large areas of the city were destroyed by German bombs in the Coventry Blitz, Ford and Gibson formulated rival visions for its reconstruction. The council chose Gibson's more radical plan, which included the ring road. Priority was given initially to building the shopping precinct and central plaza, but detailed planning began in 1955, the council deciding to build the road in six stages. In 1959 the first section of the road was built, linking London Road and St Patrick's Road in the south east of the city centre. This was followed in 1961 by stage two, Bishop Street to Hill Street, in the north west.", "In the early 20th century, Coventry was the fastest-growing city in the UK, as immigrants from across the country moved in to work in the expanding automotive, bicycle, aviation and armament industries. The city's boundaries expanded in stages, absorbing nearby villages as well as new residential areas. As the city grew, the council built upgrades to the city's radial roads but these did not include the city centre, which retained its medieval character until 1930. By then its buildings and infrastructure were unable to cope with the needs of the increased population and the council tasked city engineer Ernest Ford with modernising it. During the 1930s Ford oversaw the construction of Corporation Street and Trinity Street as well as widening other roads. This involved large-scale demolition and relocation of residents to other areas of the city, and created the city's first sections of inner ring road, on what is now the inner circulatory route. He also created the southern by-pass, re-routing the A45 around the city. In early 1939 the council appointed Donald Gibson as city architect. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Patrick Abercrombie at the University of Liverpool School of Architecture, Gibson assembled a young team or architects and began work on plans more radical than Ford's. These were presented to the public at an exhibition in summer 1940 and included a new civic zone north-east of the cathedral, an area not well-developed at the time."]}, {"page": "Donald Gibson", "response": ["Donald Gibson may refer to:", "*Donald Gibson (architect) (1908\u20131991), City architect for Coventry from 1938 to 1954"]}, {"page": "David Eyre Percival", "response": ["He then became Deputy City Architect under Donald Gibson in Coventry."]}, {"page": "Owen Owen Building, Coventry", "response": ["The architectural theme around which most buildings in Coventry's post-war shopping precinct were based was set in 1948 by Donald Gibson's design for Broadgate House.
