When he finally played, against Oxford University in 1949, he took eight catches and a stumping, setting a Warwickshire record. However, he had to remain the county's reserve wicket-keeper, because the regular wicket-keeper, Dick Spooner, was a better batsman.\nLewis played as an amateur, and was selected three times to keep wicket for the Gentlemen against the Players.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sandy Allen (cricketer)", "response": ["His grandfather, Esmond Lewis, was also a first-class cricketer, playing 47 matches for Warwickshire after the Second World War.Sandy Allen at ESPNcricinfo"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Esmond Lewis (1949\u20131958) : E.
