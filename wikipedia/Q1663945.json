He is best remembered for his work with the physicist Hans Geiger, which resulted in the Geiger\u2013Nuttall law of radioactive decay.\nNuttall graduated from the University of Manchester in 1911 and was appointed Assistant Lecturer in Physics at the University of Leeds. During World War I, he served as a captain with the Royal Engineers. In 1921 he became Assistant Director of the University of Manchester's Physical Laboratories, a post he held until 1955.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hans Geiger", "response": ["In 1911 Geiger and John Mitchell Nuttall discovered the Geiger\u2013Nuttall law (or rule) and performed experiments that led to Rutherford's atomic model.H.
