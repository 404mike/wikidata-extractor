For instance, the concept of matter should be interpreted not as an absolute property of nature in itself, but instead of how scientifically-grounded mathematical relations describe how the concept of matter interacts with other properties, whether that be in a broad sense such as the gravitational fields that mass produces or more empirically as how matter interacts with sense systems of the body to produce sensations such as weight. Its aim is to comprise all important aspects of an empirical theory in one formal framework.

The Logical Structure of the World, Berkeley: University of California Press. was resurrected by John Worrall (1989), who proposes that there is retention of structure across theory change. Worrall, for example, argued that Fresnel's equations imply that light has a structure and that Maxwell's equations, which replaced Fresnel's, do also; both characterize light as vibrations. Fresnel postulated that the vibrations were in a mechanical medium called \"ether\"; Maxwell postulated that the vibrations were of electric and magnetic fields.  The structure in both cases is the vibrations and it was retained when Maxwell's theories replaced Fresnel's.J. Worrall (1989). \"Structural realism: The best of both worlds?\" Dialectica, 43: p. 119; available online.  Because structure is retained, structural realism both (a) avoids pessimistic meta-induction and (b) does not make the success of science seem miraculous, i.e., it puts forward a no-miracles argument.The term is due to Hilary Putnam (see Putnam, H., 1975.
