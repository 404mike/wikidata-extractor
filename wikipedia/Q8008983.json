He was a noted all-rounder and right-arm underarm fast bowler who played major cricket from 1786 to 1816.As a batsman, Fennex was reputed to be one of the first to use forward play and was said to be a good driver of the ball. As a bowler, at a time when only underarm bowling was permitted, he was said to have the highest delivery of anybody, \"his hand, when propelling the ball, being nearly on a level with his shoulder\".He began his working life as a blacksmith, and stood five feet ten inches tall, \"muscular and abstemious\". His playing career began with Berkshire in 1785 but he was chiefly associated with Middlesex and was keeper of the ground at Uxbridge.  He made 85 known first-class appearances until 1800 and then played occasionally, making nine more appearances from 1802 to 1816. He played for the Players in the inaugural Gentlemen v Players match in 1806.He kept the Portman Arms inn at Marylebone for a time, and in old age was employed as a gardener and groundsman. Like William Beldham, he provided James Pycroft with his reminiscences.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Beldham", "response": ["Although he was remembered primarily as a fine attacking batsman, Beldham was an all-rounder who took many wickets by operating as a change bowler. When he was interviewed by James Pycroft, Beldham claimed that he, William Fennex and Harry Walker had revolutionised batting by introducing the cut (Walker) and forward play (Beldham and Fennex).Harry Altham (1962) A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin. p. 46. This is contradicted by John Nyren who says that the earlier Hambledon batsman Tom Sueter was noted for his cut shot and probably invented forward play, being the first player known to leave his crease and play the drive.Nyren, p. 60."]}, {"page": "1838 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** William Fennex, cricketer (born 1763)"]}, {"page": "George T. Boult", "response": ["Boult was an amateur player who was involved in organising matches as well as being a good batsman.  He is primarily associated with Berkshire via the influential Maidenhead club.  Boult was probably Berkshire's best regular player during the short period that it enjoyed first-class status, although the team did benefit from appearances by such as Thomas Taylor, William Fennex, William Beldham, David Harris and other good players of the time.  Boult subsequently played for Middlesex."]}, {"page": "Middlesex county cricket teams", "response": ["Middlesex used Lord's Old Ground when it opened in 1787, with the earliest known match on the ground being between Middlesex  and an Essex XI on 31 May 1787.

Mote), p.36."]}, {"page": "John Mitford (priest)", "response": ["Mitford was in early life a cricketer, and from the conversation of William Fennex, a cricket veteran whom he supported by charitable work in his garden at Benhall, he wrote many newspaper articles and compiled a manuscript volume, which he gave to the Rev. James Pycroft in 1836. On it Pycroft laid the structure of his work on the Cricket Field, 1851."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|William Fennex"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1787\u20131826)", "response": ["* William Fennex (1791\u20131800) : W.

Lumpy Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey was, as Haygarth says, a \"given man\" on the Hambledon/Hampshire side but, in addition, the team included Earl of Winchilsea (White Conduit Club), Edward Hussey (Kent) and William Fennex (Middlesex). The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex. The other nine were usually associated with Kent: Stephen Amherst, James Aylward (though he played for Hampshire until 1779), Francis Booker, John Boorman, William Bowra, William Brazier, William Bullen, Robert Clifford and Henry Crozoer.", "According to CricketArchive (CA), teams called \"A to M\" and \"N to Z\" played each other five times in three seasons from 1787. The main secondary source for the five matches is again S&B which calls the two teams \"Earl of Winchilsea's Side\" and \"Sir Horace (Horatio) Mann's Side\". There is nothing in S&B to suggest that the teams were organised alphabetically. Furthermore, the so-called \"A to M\" teams included Tom Taylor and the \"N to Z\" included James Aylward and William Fennex. CA claims that these were \"given men\" and also that the two patrons evidently alternated between the teams, which would put Winchilsea into \"A to M\" and Mann into \"N to Z\". The S&B version is supported by the ACS.Haygarth, S&B volume 1, pp. 77\u201391ACS, Important Cricket Matches, p. 27."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|William Fennex"]}]}}
