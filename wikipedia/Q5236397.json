He began an apprenticeship with his father at the Leach Pottery St Ives, Cornwall, in 1930 and trained as a pottery manager at the North Staffordshire Technical College, Stoke-on-Trent, 1935-37.  He subsequently managed the pottery, changing over from a wood-burning to an oil-burning kiln and modernising the workshop.During the Second World War Leach became liable to call-up in 1941, but, as a Christian pacifist, expressed his conscientious objection by refusing to don uniform. After two courts-martial, he finally accepted enlistment in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.In 1955 Leach left St Ives to set up the Lowerdown Pottery at Bovey Tracey, Devon, where he became known for his porcelain.  Christopher Gowing and Paul Rice describe his work: \"The style was very close to that of his father, but the difference in their nature made for very different pots.  A fluted, celadon bowl by David Leach looks nothing like the same thing made by his father.  The Bernard Leach bowl would be thick, bold, rough, opaque with wide fluting and little difference in colour between body and glaze.  David Leach's would be thin, smooth, translucent, and with precise, narrow fluting and a wide range of colour - from jade green to 'ying ch'ing' blue - on a white body.\u201d  He was chairman of the Craft Potters Association of Great Britain in 1967 and exhibited widely in the UK as well as New York City, Washington DC, Tokyo, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, D\u00fcsseldorf, Heidelberg and Munich.\nIn 1987 he was appointed OBE for his work in studio pottery and his services to education.\nHis three sons,  John, Jeremy, and Simon, are all potters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bernard Leach", "response": ["Many potters from all over the world were apprenticed at the Leach Pottery, and spread Leach's style and beliefs.

Another of his students at St Ives was William Worrall who became chief craftsman at the Chalice Well crafts guild in Glastonbury. His American apprentices include Warren MacKenzie (who likewise influenced many potters through his teaching at the University of Minnesota), Byron Temple, Clary Illian and Jeff Oestrich. He was a major influence on the leading New Zealand potter Len Castle who travelled to London to spend time working with him in the mid-1950s. Another apprentice was an Indian potter Nirmala Patwardhan who developed the so-called Nirmala glaze based on an 11th-century Chinese technique. Many of his Canadian apprentices made up the pottery scene of the Canadian west coast during the 1970s in Vancouver.
