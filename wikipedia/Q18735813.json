He was the fourth son of George (died 1794), a weaver and deacon at the Presbyterian Octagon Chapel, and Mary (died 1804), his wife. William Maltby was a cousin. Though presbyterian by persuasion, the family were not hostile to the Anglican Church. Maltby attended Norwich Grammar School, where he became close to headteacher Samuel Parr but when Parr retired in 1785, he transferred to Winchester College under Joseph Warton. William Enfield also reputedly played a part in his education.Varley (2004)"]}, {"page": "London Institution", "response": ["Richard Porson, poet and scholar, was unanimously chosen as the first Librarian of the London Institution at a meeting on 22 April 1806. With the position went a salary of \u00a3200 per annum, a servant and rent-free accommodation. Thomas Campbell, the Scottish poet, had come to London to be considered for the position and had been 'well received' but rejected. A man of Porson's eminence seemed a coup for the Institution and shortly afterwards the governors were able to buy the library of the Marquis of Lansdowne. However Porson turned out to be unsuited for the post because of his heavy drinking and untidy ways. As his responsibilities grew in proportion to the Institution's increasing collection of valuable books he failed to meet the challenge. Before any action needed to be taken, he died in September 1808 shortly after a fit of 'apoplexy' in the street that had led to him being anonymously committed to St Martin's Lane workhouse. William Maltby was chosen as librarian in 1809 to replace him."]}, {"page": "Richard FitzPatrick", "response": ["From 1773 to 1791, Richard Fitzpatrick lived at 19 Norfolk Street (now Dunraven), off Park Lane in London.F. H. W. Sheppard, Survey of London: Volume 40: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair. During that time, he and Fox, like many of their contemporaries, gambled ruinously. They frequented the pro-Whig club Almack's, which later became Brooks's, where thousands of pounds could be lost or won in a single night. Of that time, Samuel Rogers wrote, \"Lord Tankerville assured me that he has played cards with Fitzpatrick at Brooks's from ten o'clock at night till near six o'clock the next afternoon, a waiter standing by to tell them 'whose deal it was', they being too sleepy to know.\"Samuel Rogers and William Maltby, Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers, 1856. When they had exhausted their own resources, of which Fox's were much greater than Fitzpatrick's, they borrowed from friends or moneylenders. Creditors once stopped Fitzpatrick's coach in the middle of a London street and took his horses as repayment.Horace Walpole to H. S. Conway, 21 May 1781.", "On 24 April that year, Samuel Rogers saw Mrs Fox emerge from the doorway of Fitzpatrick's London house on Arlington Street \"sobbing violently\", and deduced that the General had not long to live.Samuel Rogers and William Maltby, Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers, 1856, p. 105. Fitzpatrick died the following day and was buried very near his country house at St Michael and All Angels, Sunninghill. The epitaph on his tomb declared him, by his own wish, \"for more than forty years the friend of Mr. Fox.\"I. M. Davis, The Harlot and the Statesman, p. 187."]}, {"page": "William Upcott", "response": ["When Richard Porson was made librarian of the London Institution, Upcott was appointed as his assistant (23 April 1806), and he continued in the same position under William Maltby. On 30 May 1834 he resigned his office."]}, {"page": "Richard Thomson (antiquarian)", "response": ["On 14 August 1834, Thomson and Edward William Brayley were elected joint-librarians of the London Institution in Finsbury Circus, in succession to William Maltby. Thomson held the post for the rest of his life."]}, {"page": "Charles Frederick Partington", "response": ["Partington was associated with the London Institution. He lectured successfully also in the North of England, and adopted the style \"Professor\". While he at times claimed a closer relationship with the London Institution, professionally he was paid there only as an assistant librarian, by William Maltby. His presumption of a position at the Institute caused friction in the end, and he had to drop any such claim. Partington lectured also at the other institutes in London (the Russell Institution, Surrey Institution, and London Mechanics Institute). He lectured to the short-lived London Chemical Society in 1824."]}]}}
