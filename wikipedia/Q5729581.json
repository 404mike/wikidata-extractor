In 1888, the circulating libraries fought back by encouraging the House of Commons to implement laws to stop \"the rapid spread of demoralising literature in this country\". However, Vizetelly was brought to court by the National Vigilance Association (NVA) for \"obscene libel\". The charge arose from the publication of the English translation of Zola's La Terre. A second case was brought the following year to force implementation of the original judgement and to remove all of Zola's works. This led to the 70-year-old publisher becoming involved in the literary cause.Sloan (2003), pp. 92\u201393. Throughout Moore stayed loyal to Zola's publisher, and on 22 September 1888, about a month before the trial, wrote a letter that appeared in the St. James Gazette. In it Moore suggested that it was improper for Vizetelly's fate to be determined by a jury of twelve tradesmen, explaining that it would be preferable to be judged by three novelists. Moore pointed out that the NVA could make the same claims against such books as Madame Bovary and Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin, as their morals are equivalent to Zola's, though their literary merits might differ.Frazier (2000), pp. 173\u2013174."]}, {"page": "Le Ventre de Paris", "response": ["Le ventre de Paris was originally translated into English by Henry Vizetelly and published in 1888 under the title Fat and Thin.

In it, Zola's efforts to expose the unpleasant underside of his contemporary society reached its apogee; none of the other Rougon-Macquart novels features such sensational material. The publication of an English translation of La Terre in 1888 led to the prosecution for obscenity of the publisher, Henry Vizetelly. The definitive critical study of La Terre remains Guy Robert's \"La Terre\" d'\u00c9mile Zola (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1952); there is surprisingly little anglophone material published on the novel.
