This was broadcast live for 52 weeks a year and drew up to 17 million viewers. His tenure ended with allegations, which he denied, that he had taken bribes to include branded goods on the programme as advertisements.

The programme was broadcast live every week by ATV, which was owned by the famous theatrical impresario Lew Grade. Production was by Val Parnell. Six programmes aired as special episodes in the United States between May and August 1966 on NBC. British stars on the show included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Petula Clark, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles' publicist Tony Barrow said that after the band's first appearance on the show on 13 October 1963, Beatlemania took off in the UK. Their performance was watched by 15\u00a0million viewers. One national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical interest in the Beatles \u2013 and it stuck.Pawlowski, Gareth L.

The original host was Michael Aspel from 1979 to 1984, followed by Michael Parkinson from 1984 to 1992. The show featured two teams, one captained by Lionel Blair and the other by Una Stubbs. Later versions of the programme had Liza Goddard as captain of the women's team. Norman Vaughan stood in for Blair for a short spell in 1980. Originally, the teams consisted of the captain, two celebrities and one member of the public. The public participation was dropped and another celebrity was added in their place. On one infamous edition of the programme, the male member of the public was handed the title he had to mime on a card by host Michael Aspel, but rather than read the mime, he read the wrong side of the card on which his name was printed. He thus mimed his name to his teammates. Lionel Blair later wrote this incident led to the dropping of the public participants.'Stage Struck'. Blair, Lionel.
