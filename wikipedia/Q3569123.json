Willis formed an extremely prolific partnership with his life-long friend Keith Waterhouse producing over 250 works. He wrote plays such as Billy Liar, The Long and the Short and the Tall, and Celebration; the screenplays for Whistle Down the Wind, A Kind of Loving and Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain; and television programmes including Budgie, Worzel Gummidge and Minder. His passion for musical theatre led to a string of hits, including Wind in the Willows, The Card, and George Stiles' and Anthony Drewe's Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 6", "response": ["*1929 \u2013 Willis Hall, English playwright and author (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Willis Hall"]}, {"page": "Lindsay Anderson", "response": ["* The Long and the Short and the Tall (Willis Hall, 1959)"]}, {"page": "Leonard Rossiter", "response": ["| Willis Hall"]}, {"page": "Jon Pertwee", "response": ["After a stint between 1974 and 1978 as the host of the Thames Television murder-mystery game show Whodunnit?, Pertwee took the starring role in Worzel Gummidge, based on the books written by Barbara Euphan Todd. Produced by ITV franchise contractor Southern Television in the initial run, it was first transmitted on ITV from 1979. Pertwee had first been approached to play the part of  Worzel Gummidge in a film to be written by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall. When this project fell through Pertwee encouraged the writers to create a television pilot instead and via his agent pitched the idea to the BBC who turned it down and then Thames Television who likewise passed on the project. Pertwee later admitted that he \"began to lose faith in the project\", until Southern Television's Lewis Rudd heard about it and enthusiastically agreed that the company would make the series. ", "The series saw Pertwee as a scarecrow, as well as using several comedic voices. The show was an immediate hit, with Pertwee describing it as \"becoming something of a cult\" after only four episodes had been broadcast. Press interest in the series was high, and it ran on the channel until 1981. Keen to continue beyond this, Pertwee campaigned for the series and it was picked up by a New Zealand network, TVNZ, in 1987. Worzel Gummidge Down Under aired for the next two years and was screened in the UK on Channel 4. In 1995, Pertwee played the role one last time in a one-off special for ITV, which celebrated 40 years of the channel. Pertwee played the title character in Worzel Gummidge, the Musical, book and lyrics by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, music by Denis King, which opened at London's Cambridge Theatre in December 1981, co-starring Una Stubbs and Geoffrey Bayldon. Pertwee also recorded an album, Worzel Gummidge Sings, as well as a Christmas single."]}, {"page": "Michael Caine", "response": ["When his career took him to London in 1954 after his provincial apprenticeship, his agent informed him that there was already a Michael White performing as an actor in London and that he had to come up with a new name immediately.
