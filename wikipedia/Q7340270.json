Mel Galley, the original guitarist, left the band shortly after and joined Whitesnake. Kendrick continued touring the United States, supporting a new Trapeze, including Texas musicians Mike Mikeska on drums and Buck Judkins on bass guitar.\nKendrick and group returned to the studio to work on a new album in 1981, which Geffen Records was supporting.
