Indeed we can go further. There is not one example in the New Testament of the use of this verb where the resistance is successful. Always the drawing power is triumphant, as here.\" Such arguments invite the criticism that Calvinists teach salvation by decree of God rather than justification by faith alone, that they \"so zealously sought to guard the free grace of God in salvation that they denied faith any involvement at all in the actual justification of sinners.\" But even if the drawing power is always triumphant, the ability to resist does not depend upon the meaning of the word \"draw\" in John 12:32, but on the question what the \"draw\" is intended to accomplish. Calvinism assumes that persons who Jesus \"draws\" will be regenerated. Arminianism states that all are drawn to Jesus to be given an enabling grace. \"Jesus does not define what 'His drawing' will accomplish in John 12, only that He will do it.\" Even if the semantics of \"draw\" are understood in the manner Calvinist's urge, this should only be taken to indicate the sufficiency of the power to draw (they were \"not able to draw\" as in John 21:6, or they were able to do so as in John 21:11), rather than to define what God does to those He draws. Arminians reject the Calvinist teaching that God draws for the purpose of forced regeneration irrespective of their wishes. Rather Arminians believe God draws all persons to provide all with an ability or enabling to believe, as prevenient grace teaches."]}, {"page": "Chronology of Jesus", "response": ["The estimation of the time of the death of Jesus based on the New Testament accounts has been the subject of debate among scholars for centuries.  The debate can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the Last Supper takes place on the first night of Passover, defined in the Torah as occurring at twilight on 14 of Nisan, and the crucifixion is the following day on 15 Nisan. However, in the Gospel of John the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover mealPaul Barnett, Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times, page 21  (InterVarsity Press, 1999).  and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts, although Raymond E. Brown, reviewing these, concluded that they can not be easily reconciled.Death of the Messiah, Volume 2 by Raymond E. Brown 1999  pages 959\u2013960 One involves the suggestion that for Jesus and his disciples, the Passover could have begun at dawn Thursday, while for traditional Jews it would not have begun until dusk that same day. Another is that John followed the Roman practice of calculating the new day beginning at midnight, rather than the Jewish reckoning.Brooke Foss Westcott, The Gospel according to St. John : the authorised version with introduction and notes (1881, page 282).

Carson, 'The Gospel According to John', Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, 1991, p604 Some have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available.Steven L.

Niswonger 1992  pages 173\u2013174 Andreas K\u00f6stenberger argues that in the first century time was often estimated to the closest three-hour mark,  and that the intention of the author of the Mark Gospel was to provide the setting for the three hours of darkness while the Gospel of John seeks to stress the length of the proceedings, starting in the 'early morning'\"The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K\u00f6stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009  page 538 Some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning.Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965), Chronology of The Last Days of Jesus \u2013 A Critical Study [Trans. from German] (pp. 35\u201371 for \u2018The Chronology of \u201cMore Than One Day\u201d) William Barclay has argued that the portrayal of the death of Jesus in the John Gospel is a literary construct, presenting the crucifixion as taking place at the time on the day of Passover when the sacrificial lamb would be killed, and thus portraying Jesus as the Lamb of God. This understanding fits with Old Testament typology, in which Jesus entered Jerusalem to identify himself as the Paschal lamb on Nisan 10 was crucified and died at 3:00 in the afternoon of Nisan 14, at the same time the High Priest would have sacrificed the Paschal lamb, and rose before dawn the morning of Nisan 16, as a type of offering of the First Fruits."]}, {"page": "History of Christian universalism", "response": ["Adolph E.
