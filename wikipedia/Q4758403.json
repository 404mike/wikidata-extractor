He is a Visiting Professor at the Department of War Studies, King's College London, a Roger and Martha Mertz Visiting Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Lehrman Institute Distinguished Lecturer at the New-York Historical Society. He has been a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, London since 2013.Roberts' public commentary has appeared in several periodicals such as The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator. He is well known internationally for his 2009 non-fiction work The Storm of War, which covers historical factors of the Second World War such as Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the organisation of Nazi Germany. The book has been lauded by several publications, notably The Economist, and it additionally received the British Army Military Book of the Year Award for 2010.Much of Roberts' work, including his 2018 biography of Winston Churchill, has been widely praised. The Sunday Times called the Churchill biography \"[u]ndoubtedly the best single-volume life of Churchill ever written.\" Elsewhere, his work has sometimes been criticised; The Economist described one book as \"a giant political pamphlet larded with its author's prejudices, with sneers at those who do not share them and with errors.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Disraeli", "response": ["Disraeli and the cabinet sent Salisbury as lead British representative to the Constantinople Conference, which met in December 1876 and January 1877.Jenkins, p. 409 In advance of the conference, Disraeli sent Salisbury private word to seek British military occupation of Bulgaria and Bosnia, and British control of the Ottoman Army.

The British imperial vision called for control over the new countries and the Dutch-speaking \"Boers\" (or \"Afrikaners\") fought back in the War in 1899\u20131902. British historian Andrew Roberts argues that the Boers insisted on keeping full control of both their two small republics, allowing no role whatever for nonwhites, and distinctly limited roles for British and other European settlers. These \"Uitlanders\" were the base of the economy, paid 80 percent of the taxes, and had no vote. The Transvaal was in no sense a democracy, argues Roberts, for no black, Britain, Catholic or Jew was allowed to vote or hold any office. Johannesburg was the business centre, with 50,000 primarily British residents, but was not permitted any local government. The English language was banned in official proceedings; no public meetings were permitted; newspapers were closed down arbitrarily; and full citizenship was technically possible but quite rare. Roberts says President Paul Kruger \"ran a tight, tough, quasi-police state from his state capital, Pretoria.\" the British government officially protested; while theoretically recognizing the Transvaal's right to manage its internal affairs, cabinet member Joseph Chamberlain detailed the many ways how Uitlanders were mistreated as second-class non-citizens, despite their essential role in producing prosperity.Andrew Roberts, A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 (2008), pp. 27\u201329."]}, {"page": "Ultra", "response": ["The existence of Ultra was kept secret for many years after the war.  Since the Ultra story was widely disseminated by Winterbotham in 1974, historians have altered the historiography of World War II. For example, Andrew Roberts, writing in the 21st century, states, \"Because he had the invaluable advantage of being able to read Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Enigma communications, General Bernard Montgomery knew how short the Germans were of men, ammunition, food and above all fuel. When he put Rommel's picture up in his caravan he wanted to be seen to be almost reading his opponent's mind. In fact he was reading his mail.\"  Over time, Ultra has become embedded in the public consciousness and Bletchley Park has become a significant visitor attraction.  As stated by historian Thomas Haigh, \"The British code-breaking effort of the Second World War, formerly secret, is now one of the most celebrated aspects of modern British history, an inspiring story in which a free society mobilized its intellectual resources against a terrible enemy.\""]}, {"page": "Winston Churchill", "response": ["Churchill married Clementine Hozier in September 1908.

First published in German (1774), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote in The Sorrows of Young Werther (as translated): \"Misunderstandings and lethargy perhaps produce more wrong in the world than deceit and malice do. At least the latter two are certainly rarer.\" An alternate expression of the idea comes from Jane West, in her 1812 novel The Loyalists: An Historical Novel: \"Let us not attribute to malice and cruelty what may be referred to less criminal motives.\" A similar quote is also misattributed to Napoleon. Andrew Roberts, in his biography of Winston Churchill, quotes from Churchill's correspondence with King George VI in February 1943 regarding disagreements with Charles De Gaulle: His 'insolence\u00a0... may be founded on stupidity rather than malice."]}, {"page": "White Australia policy", "response": ["Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\". Historian Andrew Roberts, in his 2006 book A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 praised the White Australia policy as being necessary to \"protect Australia as an English-speaking nation\". Roberts wrote the White Australia policy was the \"right\" immigration policy to pursue as he accused Asian immigrants of spreading infectious diseases and stated \"Australia had the right (and duty) to protect herself\" from Asian immigration. Views such as those expressed by Roberts have been in the minority. In 2009, the Australian historian Erin Ihde described the White Australia policy as \"discredited\" both within the historians' community and with the general public. Ihde wrote that the White Australia policy remains a difficult subject within the Australian popular memory of the past as it was the fear of the so-called \"Yellow Peril\" in the form of Asian immigration and the possibility of Asian nations such as China and Japan posing a military threat to Australia that played a major role in the formation of the Australian federation in 1901. Ihde argued the White Australia policy was not an aberration in Australian history, nor was it marginal, making it problematic to integrate into a positive view of Australian history.

Parnell was a close friend and political associate of fellow land reform activist Thomas Nulty, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath, until Parnell's divorce crisis in 1889. Parnell was linked both with the landed aristocracy class and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, with speculation in the 1890s that he may have even joined the latter organisation. The historian Andrew Roberts argues that he was sworn into the IRB in the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin in May 1882 and that this was concealed for 40 years. In Barry O'Brien's Parnell, X, Fenian Parliamentarian John O'Connor Power, relates, 'And, in fact, I was, about this time [1877], deputed to ask Parnell to join us. I did ask him. He said \"No\" without a moment's hesitation.' He was conservative by nature, leading some historians to suggest that personally he would have been closer to the Conservative Party rather than to the Liberal Party, but for political needs. Andrew Kettle, Parnell's right-hand man, who shared a lot of his opinions, wrote of his own views, \"I confess that I felt [in 1885], and still feel, a greater leaning towards the British Tory party than I ever could have towards the so-called Liberals.\" In later years, the double effect of the Phoenix Park trauma and the O'Shea affair reinforced the conservative side of his nature."]}, {"page": "Joseph Stilwell", "response": ["The British historian Andrew Roberts quoted Stilwell's disparaging remarks about the British war effort in Asia to illustrate his strong Anglophobia, which became a stumbling block to smooth co-operation between American and British forces in Asia.

Chiang, not Stilwell, was the Chinese forces' commander-in chief, and Chiang resisted Stilwell's initiatives if they involved committing Chinese forces to do-or-die engagements or if Chinese troops were removed from his immediate control to bases in India. Mitter viewed Chiang as correct in attempting to husband China's resources after the serious losses in 1937 to 1941. Mitter also supported the view that Chennault could have accomplished much more if Stilwell had not diverted a large proportion of lend-lease equipment to the Chinese troops in India. Mitter factored in the impact of the collaborationist Wang Jingwei as yet another major force in China. Stilwell's mastery of written and spoken Chinese made him the default American choice for the China command.

Brooke vigorously allocated responsibilities to his deputies.
