In his act, he swallows various items, such as coins, lightbulbs, balloons, nails, billiard balls, dry sugar, lighter fluid and goldfish, and then regurgitates them. The implausibility of some of his performances, such as regurgitating a \"solved\" Rubik's cube, have resulted in some observers believing that he is an illusionist. Starr has a busy international touring schedule for his solo act.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Strathaven", "response": ["*Stevie Starr, Performance artist and contestant on Britain's Got Talent and America's Got Talent"]}, {"page": "Chris Franklin", "response": ["Franklin has performed with numerous musicians and comedians, including Jimeoin, Steady Eddy, Garry Who, Carl Barron, Richard Stubbs, Elliot Goblet, Raymond J Bartholomew, Marty Fields, The Empty Pockets, John Robertson, Peter Rowsthorn, Bob Franklin, Stevie Starr, and Mr Methane."]}, {"page": "Tonight Live with Steve Vizard", "response": ["Some of the best known guests included Peter Allen, Steve Allen, Jeffrey Archer, Michael Aspel, Neil Aspinall, Anita Baker, Kathy Bates, David Bellamy, George Benson, Cilla Black, Deborah Blando, Lothaire Bluteau, John Bluthal, Victor Borge, Daryl Braithwaite, Marlon Brando, Michael Caine, Chevy Chase, Julian Clary, Jackie Collins, Pauline Collins, Phil Collins, Harry Connick Jr., Alice Cooper, Cindy Crawford, Russell Crowe, Billy Crystal, Macaulay Culkin, Jamie Lee Curtis, Charles Dance, Edward de Bono, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Phyllis Diller, Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr., Duran Duran, Sheena Easton, Clint Eastwood, Britt Ekland, Ben Elton, Gloria Estefan, Emilio Estevez, John Farnham, Sally Field, Bob Geldof, Mel Gibson, Whoopi Goldberg, Jill Goodacre, Elliott Gould, Jerry Hall, Daryl Hannah, Rolf Harris, Debbie Harry, Goldie Hawn, Audrey Hepburn, Bob Hope, Whitney Houston, Barry Humphries, Natalie Imbruglia, Jeremy Irons, Billy Joel, Elton John, Quincy Jones, Tom Jones, B.B.

The act consists of swallowing and regurgitating various unusual objects. The objects may consist of anything from live animals (live aquatic: Mac Norton) and (live mice: The Great Waldo), to light bulbs, billiard balls (Stevie Starr) and kerosene (Hadji Ali). The act also includes water spouting in which a performer will drink a large amount of fluids and regurgitate them in a controlled manner.", "Some magicians perform regurgitation as part of their act (for instance, Harry Houdini), but professional regurgitators may perform regurgitation exclusively. In some cases, there is debate as to whether demonstrations are true feats of regurgitation or \"tricks\". For example, Stevie Starr as part of his performance has swallowed an unsolved Rubik's Cube, then regurgitated a solved cube."]}]}}
