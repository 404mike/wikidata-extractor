Since Hadrian's Wall does not deviate to avoid the well, this may suggest that the boundary wall around the well was built some time after in order to control the flow of water in a marshy area."]}, {"page": "1834 in archaeology", "response": ["* John Clayton begins to safeguard Hadrian's Wall."]}, {"page": "Housesteads Roman Fort", "response": ["In 1698, the farm had been sold to Thomas Gibson who turned the land around the fort to agriculture and thus ploughed up numerous Roman artefacts. The 17th-century bastle house was replaced by a farmhouse located over the Roman hospital, which was sketched by William Stukeley in 1725. Throughout the 18th century Housesteads was farmed by a single tenant farming family. Since Hodgson recorded the presence of William Magnay as the tenant during that period this fixes the tenure. In particular, the well (thought to be Roman) was documented as having actually been built by William, and used by the family as a bath. Interest in the fort increased in the 19th century, particularly after the farm was purchased by the amateur historian John Clayton in 1838, to add to his collection of Roman Wall farms. The Roman site was cleared of later buildings by Clayton, and the present farmhouse built about 1860. John Maurice Clayton attempted to auction the fort in 1929. It did not reach its reserve and was donated to the National Trust in 1930. The farm was later owned by the Trevelyans who gave the land for the site museum."]}, {"page": "1876 in archaeology", "response": ["* October - Excavations by John Clayton in Coventina's Well at Carrawburgh on Hadrian's Wall yield at least 13,400 Roman coins."]}, {"page": "John Clayton", "response": ["John Clayton may refer to:", "*John Clayton (painter) (1728\u20131800), English artist", "*John Clayton Adams (1840\u20131906), English landscape artist ", "*John Clayton (Australian actor) (1940\u20132003), Australian actor", "*John Clayton (British actor) (1845\u20131888), British actor", "*John Clayton (bassist) (born 1952), American jazz bassist", "*John Clayton (sportswriter) (born 1954), writer and reporter for ESPN and SportsCenter", "*John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, birthname of the fictional character Tarzan", "*John Clayton (Roundhead) (1620\u2013?), English politician", "*John Clayton (town clerk) (1792\u20131890), antiquarian and town clerk of Newcastle upon Tyne, England", "*John Clayton Allen (1860\u20131939), American politician", "*John Clayton (cricketer) (1857\u20131938), English cricketer", "*John Clayton (footballer, born 1961), Scottish footballer", "*John Clayton (footballer, born 1907), English footballer", "*John Clayton (rugby union) (1848\u20131924), England rugby union player", "*John Clayton (1657\u20131725), rector of Crofton, West Yorkshire, and scientific author", "*John Clayton (botanist) (1694\u20131773), colonial Virginia", "*John Clayton (divine) (1709\u20131773), English cleric, Methodist and Jacobite", "*John Clayton (minister) (1754\u20131843), English Independent"]}, {"page": "Carrawburgh", "response": ["Only the fort's earthworks are now visible, the Wall at this point and the fort's north ramparts having been demolished for the construction of General Wade's early 18th-century military road (now the B6318).
