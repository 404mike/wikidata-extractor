He has also been a member of Asia, Ultravox, Hugo, FM, The Ladder, Phoenix Down, and on his own project with Sam Blue, Burns Blue. He is active as a producer and owns his one recording studio (\"The Viper Room\").

The first album with this lineup was Aqua, released in June 1992. In addition to Downes and Payne, the album featured Howe, Palmer, and guitarist Al Pitrelli (of Danger Danger, Megadeth and Alice Cooper). Howe returned during the sessions having just left Yes again, but Palmer would leave soon, committing to an ELP reunion, and was able to play on just three songs. Drummers Simon Phillips and Nigel Glockler then completed the sessions. Downes' environmentalist single \"Who Will Stop the Rain?\" (originally written for Max Bacon and the aborted Rain project, later appearing on Bacon's album From the Banks of the River Irwell) attracted some radio attention. The Aqua club tour featured Howe (whose presence was heavily promoted), who took the stage after the fifth song. The tour was successful enough to warrant the band's continuation. The 1992\u201393 tour featured Downes, Howe, Payne, guitarist Vinny Burns and drummer Trevor Thornton. Before a European festival tour in late 1993, Howe and Burns left and were replaced by guitarist Keith More.", "*Vinny Burns \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (1992\u20131993)"]}, {"page": "Ultravox", "response": ["* Vinny Burns \u2013 guitar (1994\u20131996)", "* Vinny Burns \u2013 guitar", " bar:burns text:\"Vinny Burns\""]}, {"page": "List of guitarists", "response": ["*Vinny Burns (Ten)"]}, {"page": "N-Trance", "response": ["The group recorded their first full-length album, Electronic Pleasure, in November 1995, which featured seven vocalists including David Grant, and musicians such as Vinny Burns and Snake Davis."]}, {"page": "Freeloaders (band)", "response": ["Under this alias they released a UK Top 10 single, \"So Much Love to Give\", which sampled The Real Thing; and an album Freshly Squeezed.

It was not long before the idea of a one disc album was dropped since Hughes ended up having written 28 songs, so it was decided to divide them into two albums \u2013 one containing the heavier material, and one that would contain the ballads. Additionally, the initial idea was to mix the album in the US, so many renowned guitarists were considered for the guitarist position, including Doug Aldrich, Lanny Cordola and Ralph Santolla. However, when it was decided to lay down the guitar parts in England, the name of the guitarist Vinny Burns (Dare, Ultravox) was brought up. The name was quite familiar to Hughes, since they both knew each other from quite a few years back. Given the fact that Mike Stone was assigned to mix the albums, the project quickly evolved into a band situation, thus marking the first official incarnation of Ten. During the first year of the band's existence, another ex-Dare member joined the band when Greg Morgan was brought in to fill in for the drummer position.", "Soon after, the band returned to the studio to record the follow-up album to Babylon, named Far Beyond the World.
