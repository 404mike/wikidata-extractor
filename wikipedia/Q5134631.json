Minton introduced the technique to the group, with the first cannon-net catch being made at Werribee on 31 December 1978.  Thereafter, although the group continued to use mist-netting occasionally for a few years, cannon-netting became the principal method used for catching waders.Robin, Libby. (2001).

Since 1981 it has had a close relationship with the Australasian Wader Studies Group (AWSG), a special interest group of Birds Australia.  The VWSG was incorporated in Victoria in 1987.  The group's mission is to  \" \u2026gather, through extensive planned fieldwork programs, comprehensive data on waders and terns throughout Victoria on a long-term basis.  This scientifically collected information is intended to form a factual base for conservation considerations, to be a source of information for education of a wider audience, to be a means of generating interest of the general community in environmental and conservation issues, and so be a major contribution to Australian, Flyway and Worldwide knowledge of waders and terns.\"   The VWSG has a membership of about 150, mainly based in Melbourne, and publishes an annual bulletin.  As well as conducting fieldwork, it has constructed cannon-nets for, and lent equipment to, other organisations in Australia to encourage more widespread research on waders.  It also assists government agencies monitoring migratory birds as potential disease vectors for avian influenza."]}, {"page": "List of Old Oundelians", "response": ["*Clive Minton, ornithologist"]}, {"page": "Clive Dudley Thomas Minton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Clive Minton"]}, {"page": "Eisenmann Medal", "response": ["* 2012 - Clive Minton"]}, {"page": "Minton (surname)", "response": ["*Clive Minton (born 1934), Australian ornithologist"]}, {"page": "2019 in Australia", "response": ["** Clive Minton, ornithologist (b. 1934)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2019", "response": ["*Clive Minton, 85, Australian ornithologist.Dr Clive D.T AM Minton"]}]}}
