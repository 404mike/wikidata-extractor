Roger was one of the sons of Sir Robert de Monaut, Knight  (born 1230, married 1261, died 1275 in Arden, Cheshire). Robert married Joan Mowbray. Joan (1247\u20131284) was born in Pontefract, W-Riding, Yorkshire (daughter of Roger Mowbray). Roger was the brother of another Robert de Montalt.\nMontalt was one of the defenders of Cambridge for King Henry III. During the reign of Edward I, he served overseas in the Gascon wars. In 1295, he was summoned to Parliament as a baron. \nRoger Montalt married Juliana, a daughter of Roger de Clifford, but they had no surviving children. \nWhen Montalt died in 1297, his estates passed to his brother, Robert (1270-1329), and his barony became extinct, but the Montalt barony was recreated in 1299 for this same Robert de Montalt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Goring-by-Sea", "response": ["The parish of Goring existed at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, under the name Garinges.
