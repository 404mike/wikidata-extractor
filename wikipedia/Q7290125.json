It is more surreal than Blackadder, however, and drops even more (deliberate) anachronisms. Many of the show's cast such as Howard Lew Lewis, Forbes Collins, Ramsay Gilderdale and Patsy Byrne had previously appeared in various episodes of Blackadder alongside Robinson. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of Robin Hood in those media.", "* Guy of Gisbourne (Ramsay Gilderdale): King John's wet-behind-the-ears nephew, who has come to live with him at the insistence of his mother, the king's older sister, Queen Eleanor. A village idiot, and mummy's boy, Guy is widely held in contempt by the heroes and villains alike. He is aged 27 but acts like a 4-year-old, has an imaginary friend and occasionally dresses in a tutu. King John does not want to be saddled with his nephew, but obeys his sister's orders out of fear that she will \"do that nasty thing with the pencils\" to him, just as she used to when they were children."]}, {"page": "Guy of Gisbourne", "response": ["In the 1990s CBBC comedy show Maid Marian and her Merry Men, Guy\u2014played by Ramsay Gilderdale\u2014is the nephew of King John."]}, {"page": "Blackadder's Christmas Carol", "response": ["* Ramsay Gilderdale as Ralph, Millicent's fianc\u00e9 (\"Giggling Ninny\" on BBC DVD cover)"]}, {"page": "Barbara (TV series)", "response": ["Barbara was first shown as a pilot within the Comedy Firsts series on 10 July 1995.
