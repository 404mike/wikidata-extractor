He subsequently transferred to No. 24 Squadron RFC. On 26 January, Ralston was appointed a flight commander with the accompanying rank of temporary captain. On 16 February, he drove down an Albatros D.V., being wounded in the fight. Upon recovery, he reverted to 84 Squadron as a flight commander. There was a lapse then, as he did not score again until 18 June 1918, when he drove down a Fokker D.VII. Nine days later, he put down a Pfalz D.III near Villers-Bretonneux. However, he was also shot down; he crash-landed in flames and escaped unscathed. Then in July, he scored his final four wins, destroying three balloons, and assisting Norman Mawle in the destruction of a Fokker D.VII. Ralston would be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross posthumously for his exploits, as he died on the day of his last victory, balloon busting south of Warvillers on 25 July 1918. His final tally was three balloons and two aircraft destroyed and seven aircraft driven down out of control.Shores, et al, p. 311."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Norman Mawle"]}, {"page": "Mawle", "response": ["*Norman Mawle (1897\u20131971), British World War I flying ace"]}]}}
