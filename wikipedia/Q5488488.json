He played in the Football League for Small Heath and Bury.For Small Heath, Mobley scored 64 goals in 103 appearances in all competitions, and was leading scorer in three successive seasons, from 1893\u201394 \u2013 when he was also overall top scorer in the Second Division \u2013 to 1895\u201396. In a 1950 interview, he told the Sports Argus that he \"could have got a few more if [he'd] been as selfish as some of the present-day forwards who seem to want to do all the scoring.\"The 1939 Register lists Mobley as living in retirement with his son, also named Frank, and his family in the Five Ways district of Birmingham. Mobley died in Birmingham in 1956 at the age of 87.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
