Long overshadowed by the fame of his earlier watercolours, these later works have more recently attracted attention as \"one of the greatest, but least recognised, achievements of any British painter.\" Cox's technique and approach in paintings such as Rhyl Sands (c. 1854) \u2013 described by the Tate as \"without parallel in British landscape painting of the 1850s\" \u2013 have led to his being seen, particularly within France, as an important precursor of impressionism.
