A report by Generals William Howley Goodenough and Sir Lothian Nicholson, the governor at the time, recommended reducing and standardising the guns to make them easier to maintain and supply.  quick-firing guns and machine guns were introduced in the coastal positions and 9.2-inch guns were installed in the retired batteries. The smaller guns would be sufficient to protect against fast-moving enemy vessels, such as torpedo boats, while the larger guns could cover the entire Strait as far as the North African shore and could fire right over the Rock to counter-bombard land-based artillery. Fourteen 9.2-inch guns were eventually installed, along with another fourteen 6-inch guns, to provide Gibraltar's primary artillery defences.Hughes & Migos, p. 130 Another four 4-inch and ten 12-pounder guns were installed in various strategic positions, mostly along the coastline, to provide inshore defence.Fa and Finlayson, p. 36"]}, {"page": "List of governors of British South African colonies", "response": ["|21 April 1897 to 5 May 1897||60px||Sir William Howley Goodenough||Acting"]}]}}
