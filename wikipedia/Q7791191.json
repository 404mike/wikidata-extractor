He started his career in non-League football with Accrington Stanley and Darwen, before moving into the professional game with Blackburn Rovers in March 1912. Jacques made two League appearances for Blackburn but left the club in 1915 to join the British Army. He served in the First World War, during which he was captured and taken as a prisoner of war.\nUpon the conclusion of the conflict, he joined Nelson in July 1919. Two seasons later, the club was accepted into the Football League and Jacques played 17 matches in the Third Division North. He scored the only goal of his League career in the 4\u20131 win against Wigan Borough on 3 September 1921. Jacques lost his place in the side following the arrival of James Price and he left Nelson in 1922. He subsequently returned to non-League football, where he had spells with Great Harwood, Barnoldswick Park Villa and finally Earby.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921\u201322 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Thomas Jacques"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["| Thomas Jacques"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["The 1924\u201325 season marked Nelson's return to the Football League Third Division North following their relegation from the Second Division at the end of the previous campaign. It was the club's fourth season in the Football League, having previously competed in the Central League. Former Scotland international defender David Wilson retired from his player-manager role in the summer of 1924 in order to take up the managerial post full-time. Thomas Jacques, who had played for Nelson during their inaugural season in the Football League, was hired as the assistant coach and groundsman. Unlike the previous summer, when Nelson had embarked on a pre-season tour of Spain, the team did not play any friendly matches during the build-up to the campaign. The club strip remained unchanged from the previous season; a blue jersey, white shorts and black socks with white and blue trim."]}]}}
