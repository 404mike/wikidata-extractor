He also stated of his desire of preserving and strengthening the military forces of Britain. He lost the election to Liberal candidate David Alfred Thomas in January 1910 but did manage to reduce the majority by half from the previous election in 1906. Despite his defeat, his popularity among voters was increasing and at the end of the election campaign a crowd of thousands of people came to see Crichton-Stuart and his wife travel to the train station. The crowd gathered outside the Angel Hotel where the couple were staying and, when they left, their carriage was pulled by around 60 volunteers. The procession stopped briefly outside Cardiff Conservative Club where Crichton-Stuart shook hands with numerous people and gave a short speech before continuing to the station. The Evening Express remarked on the procession, stating \"never before has a parliamentary candidate, victorious or defeated, been so honoured by the people of Cardiff\". On the polling day, Lord Ninian's son caught a chill being driven around Cardiff and later died. He was buried near Falkland Palace in Fife. Crichton-Stuart and his family did not permanently reside in Cardiff until he and his wife moved there in April 1910, moving into Penylan Court which had previously been the residence of William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely. A second election was held in December 1910 following a hung parliament, in which Crichton-Stuart was successful, taking the seat from the Liberal candidate Clarendon Hyde, with a majority of 299 votes, a turnaround of 1,800 votes in the space of ten months. With a history in the military, the majority of the issues he raised before parliament concerned the armed forces, including the high costs officers were faced with during manoeuvres and a petition to improve the weaponry provided to the British cavalry units."]}, {"page": "Cathays Cemetery", "response": ["*William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely, shipowner"]}, {"page": "Tatem (surname)", "response": ["*William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely"]}, {"page": "Lord Glanely", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely"]}, {"page": "Tatem Baronets", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely"]}, {"page": "Dancing Time", "response": ["Dancing Time was a bay mare, bred by her owner William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely.
