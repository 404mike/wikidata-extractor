He joined the Met Office in 1941 and worked all over the UK (as well as a stint in Hong Kong between 1953 and 1956) before being seconded to the BBC in 1962. After a few months he moved to Southern Television's evening news magazine Day by Day. He worked with a number of different co-presenters including Cliff Michelmore, Barry Westwood and Fred Dinenage and his role gradually expanded (reading out congratulatory messages, writing a book) until eventually he was given his own show The Trevor Baker All Weather Show. Baker remained in his position when the franchise changed to TVS (Television South) in 1982 and continued on until 1987. When people in Southampton said \"Trevor says it's going to be fine today\", nobody ever said \"Trevor who?\". He had achieved that ultimate accolade, accorded to very few, of being immediately identifiable by his first name.  In all he was on-air for 25 years \u2014at the time Britain's longest-serving TV weather forecaster.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southern Television", "response": ["Regular programmes produced by Southern Television included the regional news magazine Day by Day, presented by Cliff Michelmore, Christopher Peacock, Barry Westwood, Peter Clark, and long-serving weather forecaster Trevor Baker; Out of Town, a countryside programme introduced by Jack Hargreaves, who would later join Southern Television's board of directors; How, a children's science programme also featuring Hargreaves along with Fred Dinenage, Bunty James (later replaced by Marian Davies) and Jon Miller; Freewheelers, a children's spy series; Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years and Worzel Gummidge, starring Jon Pertwee as the eponymous walking scarecrow.
