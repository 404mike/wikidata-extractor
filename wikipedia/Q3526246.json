Zimbabwe beat Pakistan by an innings and 64 runs, the team's first ever Test victory, mainly due to a double century from Grant Flower, as well as centuries from Andy Flower and Guy Whittall. Olonga took the wicket of Saeed Anwar in his first over, but he was no-balled once for throwing. With help from Dennis Lillee, he rebuilt his action at the MRF Pace Foundation before returning to international cricket. He was overlooked from Zimbabwe squad for the 1998 Commonwealth Games in September 1998. Thereafter, he began training harder with fellow seamer Heath Streak and got into the national team after remodelling his bowling action.
