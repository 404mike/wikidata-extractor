David Jeans, a schoolfriend of the Nicol brothers, joined the band to play drums. Robert Dillam, formerly of Adorable, joined to play guitar.

Its earliest lineup consisted of Chris Bathgate (Arab Strap), David Jeans (Arab Strap, The Zephyrs) and bassist Rob Doig (The Fuse). Playing a series of low key shows around Glasgow and Edinburgh, the band quickly built up a following, culminating in them playing the main stage at George Square, Glasgow at the Winterfest Festival to an audience of several thousand people. This early success was reflected in their being named XFM band of the week, and crowned 'Unsigned Heroes' by Radio 1, on the basis of some rough demo material, which was released as a limited self pressed EP 'Shimmer in the City'."]}, {"page": "Jeans (surname)", "response": ["* David Jeans (born 1970), Scottish drummer"]}, {"page": "Jeans, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Jeans"]}]}}
