Two years later he transferred to Port Vale for a fee of \u00a3300,000. He spent three years with Vale, before he was sold on to Plymouth Argyle for the same price. During his time at Vale Park he was selected in the PFA's Second Division team of the season in 1992\u201393, before he won promotion out of the division in 1993\u201394; he also won the TNT Tournament in 1992 and the Football League Trophy in 1993 with the club.

In 1997, he signed with Bury for \u00a350,000, before he returned to Burnley as a free transfer signing the following year.

This was despite having a succession of different strike partners throughout the season, including Simon Garner, Luther Blissett, David Speedie and even midfielder Gary Robson. However, when Andy Hunt arrived at Albion in March 1993, he and Taylor quickly forged a successful striking partnership that would last several seasons. Hunt and Taylor were part of the Baggies team that beat Port Vale at Wembley in the Division Two playoff final, to secure promotion to Division One. In the second half, with the game still goalless, Taylor was through on goal when he was brought down by former Leeds teammate Peter Swan.

He was also entrusted with the club's captaincy. He played 46 games in the 1990\u201391 season, and scored his first goal for the \"Valiants\" in a 3\u20132 win over Portsmouth on 19 January. He was consistent again in the relegation season of 1991\u201392, making another 46 appearances. He played 48 games in the 1992\u201393 season, and played a leading role in the club's victorious Football League Trophy campaign. The final was played at Wembley Stadium, and Aspin played alongside Peter Swan and Dean Glover to help Vale record a 2\u20131 win over Stockport County.

Paul Musselwhite denied Donovan and Paul Raven after Bob Taylor exploited Port Vale defender Peter Swan's lack of pace.
