J. K. Smith. He played in all five Tests on the tour, and was used largely as a stock bowler, with the spinners Fred Titmus and David Allen taking most wickets. A spate of injuries on the tour led to a call-up for Ken Palmer, who was coaching locally, and Geoffrey Boycott was also used as a bowler. Thomson took nine wickets in the five Tests, only four more than Boycott. This was not Thomson's only overseas experience with MCC.

Then, at the end of the 1964 season, Stephenson, who had been injured for most of it, stepped down from the Somerset captaincy. Bill Alley, rumbustious Australian all-rounder, who had deputised as captain in Stephenson's absence in 1964, was not seen as a long-term captain, and Atkinson was released from school duties to take the job for 1965.

Unlike Ken, Roy Palmer's batting was normally no better than lower-order, and though he made 84 batting at No 9 against Leicestershire in 1967, he never again passed 50.CricketArchive. https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/28/28876.html. Accessed 28 October 2007. His bowling, too, was inclined to be expensive. His best season was 1969, when Somerset finished bottom of the County Championship: handed the new ball for much of the season, he took 60 wickets, but at a cost of almost 32 runs per wicket. When, in 1970, that average moved upwards to beyond 37 runs per wicket, he was not re-engaged."]}, {"page": "Geoff Hall (cricketer)", "response": ["For the 1963 season, Somerset recruited the Worcestershire fast bowler Fred Rumsey as a new-ball partner for Ken Palmer; Rumsey was an instant success, and became a Test player from 1964, so Hall's opportunities in the first team in both 1963 and 1964 were much reduced. Injury to Palmer in 1965 and Rumsey's Test calls led to more matches for Hall in 1965, and with 41 wickets at an average of 24.48 he had his best season in first-class cricket. Against Cambridge University in June, he took five wickets for 33 runs, the best performance of his career to that point. And he then bettered that with six for 60 in Nottinghamshire's first innings in the match at Worksop, a game in which he also had to hold out at the end as a batsman to save the match, which he did by courtesy of being dropped at backward short leg in the last-but-one over of the game."]}, {"page": "Graham Burgess (cricketer)", "response": ["An education at Millfield School helped to steer all-round sportsman Burgess to a career in cricket. Although the Somerset side at the time was not known for signing local talent, earning it a tag of 'a team of all nations', Burgess became an exception. He appeared for Somerset Second XI regularly between 1963 and 1966, impressing with both bat and ball. He made his debut for the first-team in a match against the touring West Indians in July 1966, and the step-up proved tough. Burgess recorded scores of 1 and 35 with the bat as Somerset followed-on, and opening the bowling, he finished with figures of 0/101. Despite his unimpressive entrance into first-class cricket, Burgess was selected for the County Championship match against Lancashire the day after the conclusion of the West Indians match. Not asked to bowl by his captain, Burgess was free to concentrate solely on his batting, and put on a 145 run partnership for the sixth wicket with Ken Palmer to help Somerset to recover from 29/5. Burgess claimed his first wicket in county cricket during a Gillette Cup match against Warwickshire in early August, a match that was also his List A debut. Burgess finished his first season with 406 runs from 21 innings at an average of 20.30 in first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "Ken Biddulph", "response": ["Lobb retired from regular first-class cricket at the end of the 1958 season to become a teacher, and Biddulph stepped up in 1959 to be Somerset's regular opening bowler, usually forming a not-much-more-than-medium-paced opening attack with Alley or Ken Palmer. He took 79 wickets at an average of 24.35 and was awarded his county cap. He took five or more wickets in an innings four times and improved his own personal best with six for 30 in the match against the Combined Services at Taunton, and these were the best figures of his entire career. His figures for the 1960 season were similar: 83 wickets at an average of 27.28."]}]}}
