After time with Norwich and Leicester, he went on to play for Reading, Manchester City, Walsall, Rotherham United, Bristol City and Sheffield Wednesday in the Football League. Robins also played across Europe during spells with FC Copenhagen, Ourense and Panionios before finishing his career with Burton Albion in the Conference National.\nIn 2007, he became manager of Rotherham United, and joined Barnsley in the same capacity in 2009, before leaving in 2011, following differences between him and the board. In 2012, he became manager of Coventry City until 2013 when he joined Huddersfield Town. Robins left Huddersfield in 2014 by mutual agreement. A few months later he became manager of Scunthorpe United before leaving in 2016. In March 2017, Robins rejoined Coventry City and a few months later won the EFL Trophy. In the 2017-18 season , Robins won the EFL League Two play-offs with the Sky Blues and were promoted to League One.
