The maritime heritage of Devon made sea shanties, hornpipes and naval or sea ballads important parts of regional folk music. From the 19th century accordions have been a popular and accepted part of the local folk sound. Folk songs from the West Country include \u2018Widdecombe Fair\u2019, \u2018Spanish Ladies\u2019 and \u2018The Seeds of Love.\u2019 The region was important in the first folk revival, as the Devon-born antiquarian Sabine Baring-Gould invested effort in collecting regional music, published as Songs and Ballads of the West (1889\u201391), the first collection published for the mass market. He later collaborated with Cecil Sharp who, with Charles Marson, produced a three volume Folk-Songs from Somerset (1904\u201309).J. Shepherd, Media, Industry and Society (London: Continuum International, 2003), p. 44. Other collectors included Henry and Robert Hammond in Dorset, the Reverend Geoffrey Hill in Wiltshire, Percy Grainger in Gloucestershire and, perhaps the most famous, Ralph Vaughan Williams' 'Folk Songs from Somerset', which provided themes for his English Folk Song Suite.D. Manning, Vaughan Williams on Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 284.

The same period saw one of the most surprising hybrids in music history Scrumpy and Western with bands like the Wurzels and The Yetties, who took most of the elements of West Country folk music for comical folk-style songs with affectionate parodies of more mainstream musical genres, delivered in local West Country dialects.Scrumpy and Western, http://www.scrumpyandwestern.co.uk/, retrieved 14/02/09.
