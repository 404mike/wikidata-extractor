He held numerous organ and choirmaster posts in churches throughout Canada from 1884 until 1913. His career in this area was cut short as his deafness worsened. He spent the remainder of his career composing and contributing articles to music periodicals like The Etude. His compositional output mainly consists of sacred works, including many anthems and works for solo organ. His more well known works include the Christmas cantata The Message of the Angels (1910), the cantata The Burden of the Cross (1912), the Easter cantata The Resurrection and the Life (1911), and the Grand Choeur in D for organ (1901). His pupil Henri Gagnon considered the latter work \"one of the very best Canadian compositions\"."]}, {"page": "1934 in British music", "response": ["*William Reed \u2013 Homage to Delius, for string sextet"]}, {"page": "William L Reed", "response": ["#redirect William Reed (composer)"]}, {"page": "William L.
