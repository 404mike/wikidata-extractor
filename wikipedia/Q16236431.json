Platt and Sinclair's respective loans at Harrogate and Guiseley were extended for a further month. York were beaten 1\u20130 away by bottom-of-the-table Dagenham, which meant they moved to within two points of York. Penn was sent off in the 57th minute for handling the ball on the goal line, and the resulting Joss Labadie penalty was saved by Flinders, before Dagenham scored the only goal through Josh Passley on 78 minutes. York signed Rochdale striker Lewis Alessandra on a one-month emergency loan and Notts County defender Scot Bennett on loan for the rest of 2015\u201316, while Massanka was recalled by Burnley. The team drew 1\u20131 at home with Barnet, which combined with Hartlepoool's win over Dagenham meant York were seven points adrift of safety. Alessandra gave York the lead 20 minutes into his debut with a shot from 10\u00a0yards after Jake Hyde hit the post, before Barnet equalised shortly before half-time through Akinde. Rzonca joined Stamford on a one-month loan, with Hare's loan at the club extended to the end of the season."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["|  Josh Passley"]}]}}
