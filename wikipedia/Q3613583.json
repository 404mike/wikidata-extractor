Margaret Atwood called it one of the \"wellsprings\" of fantasy literature. Le Guin wrote five subsequent books that are collectively referred to as the Earthsea Cycle, together with A Wizard of Earthsea: The Tombs of Atuan (1971), The Farthest Shore (1972), Tehanu (1990), The Other Wind (2001), and Tales from Earthsea (2001).

A Wizard of Earthsea received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection Fantasy for Children, British critic Naomi Lewis described it in the following terms: \"[It is not] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves in one of the most important works of fantasy of our time.\" Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that \"Le Guin has\u00a0... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy\", while a review in The Guardian by author and journalist Amanda Craig said it was \"The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [written] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail.\""]}, {"page": "School and university in literature", "response": ["* Amanda Craig: A Private Place"]}, {"page": "A Vicious Circle", "response": ["A Vicious Circle (1996) is a novel by Amanda Craig which dissects and satirizes contemporary British society.

The New Statesman remarked on the \"striking portraits of three generations of women\" in the sequel Liveship Traders trilogy, and stated that though Hobb's works had a medieval setting, her themes resonated in the modern world. The Telegraph likewise said of her characters that \"their longings and failings are our own, and we find our view of the world indelibly changed by their experiences\". Comparing her writing with that of literary novelists, The Telegraph described Hobb's novels as transcending the fantasy genre.

In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that \"almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed\" (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone gets in the way of plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel \"a quick read\". Complaining that the book leaves the reader \"longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry\", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that \"sex plays virtually no role in the story\u00a0...\u00a0[and] one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent\".

What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born.
