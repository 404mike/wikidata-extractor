Among the prominent writers and naturalists he associated with was James Rennie, whom he assisted in the editing of Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne in 1833. In his early writings he was influenced by the quinarian system, but tended to be a general natural theologian. Although he worked on insect classification and diversity for more than thirty years from the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, he never accepted ideas on evolution. Darwin even suspected that an anonymous author of a bad review of his book in the Athen\u00e6um to have been Westwood. That review was however by John Leifchild although Westwood remained a critic of Darwin to the extent that he proposed a \u201cpermanent  endowment  of  a  lecturer  [at Oxford] to combat the errors of Darwinism.\u201d He considered mimetic resemblances of insects as freaks of nature. Westwood was succeeded in the Hope chair by E.B. Poulton who adopted evolutionary views.

However, dogs can be taught to overcome their fear if habituated to it at an early age. As pups,  Russian wolfhounds are sometimes introduced to captured live wolves, and are trained to grab them  behind the ears in order to avoid being injured by the wolf's teeth.Borzoi - The Russian Wolfhound.

Among those that use fibres and fibrous materials such as grass for nesting, many tend to weave the nests, but even nests that initially are purely woven, such as those of weaver birds, later are lined with downy materials that largely become felted, both with each other and with the surrounding nest material. Similarly birds such as sparrows, that build large, twiggy nests, line them with downy material. Many kinds of birds however do little weaving in building their nests, but instead construct their nests mainly of fibrous and downy materials such as fine wool, moss, lichen, spiders' nests, tufts of cotton, arachnoid fluff from plants, or bark scales, supported by twigs or the walls of burrows and the like, depending on the circumstances within which they nest. James Rennie remarked: \"A circumstance also never neglected, is to bind the nest firmly into the forks of the bush where it is placed, by twining bands of moss, felted with wool, round all the contiguous branches, both below and at the sides. During the nesting season such birds commonly become such avid seekers of suitable materials that down feathers or tufts of wool may be used as bait for trapping them. Birds that concentrate heavily on felted nests include goldfinches (Carduelis species) and related species. Hummingbirds tend to use a lot of spiderweb together with moss and similar material.  Small warbler-like birds of many genera such as Prinia and Cisticola make their nests either heavily lined with, or entirely of felted material.Rennie, James.

Publisher: John Voelcker Bird Book Fund. 2005  Ground nesting birds often use felted material rather than woven; it usually suffices and some of the structures can be deceptively sophisticated. For example, the common eider, famous for the valuable down harvested from its abandoned nests, lays its eggs in very lightly felted bowls of its own down; simple though this seems, the thick, soft layer provides exceptional insulation."]}, {"page": "James Rennie (disambiguation)", "response": ["James Rennie (1787\u20131867) was a Scottish naturalist.", "James Rennie may also refer to:", "*James Rennie (actor) (1889\u20131965), Canadian-American actor", "*James Rennie (golfer) (1826\u20131924), Scottish golfer", "*James Rennie (Under the Dome), fictional character in Under the Dome", "*James Rennie, Junior, fictional character in Under the Dome"]}, {"page": "Ornithological Dictionary", "response": ["A second edition, extensively revised by James Rennie in 1831, was panned by scientific critics.", "The second edition appeared in 1831, described as being \"By Colonel G.

It was fully numbered and ran to lx (60 pages of introductory matter) + 592 pages. The text was revised by the Scottish naturalist James Rennie, Montagu having died in 1815. Rennie was not an ornithologist; he had earlier published books such as Insect Architecture and Insect Transformations. The second edition was published by Hurst, Chance, and Co, of St Paul's, London. Rennie states that he has \"made very considerable alterations in the arrangement\". He criticises Montagu's grouping of all species of a genus together, as with \"Duck-Eider, Duck-King\" as \"an unnecessary awkwardness, attended with no apparent advantage\", and instead lists them as written. He also criticises the use of \"greater\" and \"lesser\" to distinguish two similar species, as of whitethroats, choosing to call the lesser whitethroat by \"the continental name, Babillard.\"Montagu and Rennie, 1831. pp. v\u2013vi", "In 1831, \"J.

D.\" attacked Rennie's \"use of system\", declaring himself disappointed, especially by Rennie's \"abuse\" of zoologists who were systematic.

The quality of their high notes was so unlike a contemporary falsetto sound that it probably gave rise to the often-heard, and likely erroneous, opinion that they sang these high notes in chest voice. By balancing between vocal registers, the singer would gain a beautiful, marrow-like, mixed tone, seeming to retain the strength of chest voice and yet protect the voice as in falsetto, although without its feminine sound, as Friedrich Schmidt remarked in his 1854 vocal textbook. James Rennie wrote in 1825 that this vocal timbre was both the sweetest and the most brilliant sound the male voice could produce, possessing incomparably more pathos than any chest sound."]}]}}
