She defends the romance novel as a form of feminism.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lady", "response": ["It remains in use, for example, as a counterpart to \"gentleman\", in the phrase \"ladies and gentlemen\", and is generally interchangeable (in a strictly informal sense) with \"woman\" (as in, \"The lady at the store said I could return this item within thirty days\"). However, some women, since the rise of second wave feminism, have objected to the term used in contexts such as the last example, arguing that the term sounds patronising and outdated when used in this way; a man in the same context would not necessarily be referred to as a \"gentleman\". One feminist writer, Robin Lakoff, in her book Language and Woman's Place (1975), notably raised the issue of the ways in which \"lady\" is not used as the counterpart of \"gentleman\". It is suggested by academic Elizabeth Reid Boyd that feminist usage of the word \"lady\" has been reclaimed in the 21st century."]}]}}
