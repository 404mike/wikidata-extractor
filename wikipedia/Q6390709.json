(The Romans may have referred to the site  as \"Lindon\".) It was discovered by David Wilson and Kenneth St Joseph in 1968 when they were conducting an aerial survey of Flanders Moss. After taking aerial photographs, they assessed the site by measuring resistance and magnetic susceptibility at ground level."]}, {"page": "Pennocrucium", "response": ["The settlement was mentioned in the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary, which described it as lying 12 miles from Uxacona (near present-day Oakengates) and 12 miles from Letocetum (Wall, near Lichfield). The exact site of Pennocrucium was identified only after aerial photography revealed cropmarks in 1946, and excavations were conducted by Kenneth St Joseph over subsequent years."]}, {"page": "John Kenneth Sinclair Saint Joseph", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth St Joseph"]}, {"page": "Muiryfold", "response": ["The site was discovered by aerial photography in 1959, and two small trenches were excavated across the north west and south east sides by Kenneth St Joseph the same year."]}, {"page": "All Saints' Church, Shuart", "response": ["The site of All Saints' Church, Shuart, was recorded on Ordnance Survey maps in the 19th century, and was confirmed in the mid-20th century through aerial photography by Kenneth St Joseph.

The pre-Congress tour was on 1 September and took delegates from Carlisle in England to Stirling via Burnswark (Siege of Burnswark) and Birrens (Blatobulgium). There was a public lecture on 2 September by Kenneth St Joseph on 'Aerial Reconnaissance and the map of Roman Scotland' accompanied by an exhibition of photographs from Cambridge University. Visits during the congress included Dunsinane Hill, the Cleaven Dyke, Inchtuthil, Fendoch, Ardoch, Kaims Castle, the Gask Ridge, Cramond Roman Fort, the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland in Edinburgh, Torwood Broch, the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Stirling Museum, Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum, Tealing Souterrain, Carpow Roman Fort, Dundee City Museum and parts of the Antonine Wall including Rough Castle Fort, Croy Hill, Bar Hill and Bearsden Bath-house. The post-Congress tour ran from Stirling to Newcastle upon Tyne in England via Pennymuir Roman camps, Woden Law hillfort and High Rochester (Bremenium)."]}, {"page": "Bellie", "response": ["Approximately  south of the site at Romancamp gate, a second site was excavated in 1967 by Kenneth St Joseph, who traced a V-shaped ditch running for  on a north-south alignment, measuring  wide and  deep where best preserved. St Joseph identified the position and profile of the ditch as strongly suggesting it was Roman, in which case he felt it would probably form part of a camp from the Flavian period measuring up to  by  and occupying around . Aerial photography in 1984 recorded another linear cropmark on the site with a well-rounded northern corner, that was excavated in 1986 and revealed the shallow remains of a ditch about  wide. Study of other aerial photographs taken on the 1970s and 1980s by the University of Cambridge suggests cropmarks provisionally showing the characteristics of a Roman camp lying to the east of Bellie old church and partially covered by an adjacent plantation."]}, {"page": "Margaret Ursula Jones", "response": ["In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones to conduct an excavation at Linford, a gravel pit near the village of Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site."]}, {"page": "John Kenneth Sinclair St Joseph", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth St Joseph"]}]}}
