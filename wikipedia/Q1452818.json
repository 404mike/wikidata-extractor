Critic Margaret Cohen describes Cooper's The Pilot as the first sea novel and Marryat's adaptation of that style, as continuing to \"pioneer\" the genre. Critic Luis Iglesias says that novels and fiction that involved the sea before these two authors \"tend to view the sea from the perspective of the shore\"focusing on the effect of a nautical culture on the larger culture or society ashore or individuals not familiar with nautical life; by example Iglesias points to how Jane Austen's novels don't represent the genre, because, though the sea plays a prominent part in their plots, it keeps actual sea-culture at a \"peripheral presence\"; similarly, Iglesias describes earlier English novels like Robinson Crusoe (1719), Moll Flanders (1722), or Roderick Random (1748) as populating the naval world with characters unfamiliar with the sea to better understand land-bound society, not fulfilling the immersive generic expectations of nautical fiction. From the development of the genre's motifs and characteristics in works like Cooper's and Marryat's, a number of notable European novelists, such as Eug\u00e8ne Sue, Edouard Corbi\u00e8re, Frederick Chamier and William Glasgock, innovated and explored the genre subsequently."]}]}}
