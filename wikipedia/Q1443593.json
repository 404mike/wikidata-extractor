Chapman replaced Langley in March 1921, and led the team to a 17th-place finish. In the summer of 1921, playmaker Clem Stephenson and the club's all-time top goal scorer George Brown were acquired. Chapman's tactics were based upon the principles of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers.Page (2006), p.\u00a0135 He is regarded as the first manager to successfully employ the counter-attack. Other progressive ideas included a disciplined fitness regime for the players, and the practice of reserve and youth teams playing the same style as the senior team. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network to find the right players for his tactical system.", "Huddersfield's aging squad was not adequately replaced.
