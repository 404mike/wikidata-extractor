Wilson's reputation was low when he left office and was still poor in 2016.Andrew S. Crines and Kevin Hickson, eds., Harold Wilson: The Unprincipled Prime Minister?: A Reappraisal of Harold Wilson (Biteback Publishing, 2016) p. 311.  Key issues he faced included the role of public ownership, membership of the European Communities, and how to avoid committing British troops to the Vietnam War. Wilson's approach to socialism was regarded by some as too moderate, by others too left-wing. A member of Labour's soft left, he joked about leading a Cabinet made up mostly of social democrats, comparing himself to a Bolshevik revolutionary presiding over a Tsarist cabinet, but there was little to divide him ideologically from the majority of his cabinet.Ben Pimlott, Harold Wilson (1992) p 264 His stated ambitions of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance, applying technology more democratically, and reducing inequality went to some extent unfulfilled.Ben Pimlott, Harold Wilson (1992), pp. 604\u20135, 648, 656, 670\u201377, 689.", "Wilson was born at Warneford Road, Cowlersley, in the western suburbs of the mill town of Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, on 11 March 1916. He came from a political family: his father James Herbert Wilson (1882\u20131971) was a works chemist who had been active in the Liberal Party, going as far as to be Winston Churchill's deputy election agent in his 1908 by-election before joining the Labour Party. His mother Ethel (n\u00e9e Seddon; 1882\u20131957) was a schoolteacher before her marriage; in 1901 her brother Harold Seddon settled in Western Australia and became a local political leader. When Wilson was eight, he visited London and a much-reproduced photograph was taken of him standing on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street. At the age of ten, he went with his family to Australia, where he became fascinated with the pomp and glamour of politics. On the way home, he told his mother, \"I am going to be prime minister.\"Ben Pimlott, Harold Wilson (1992), pp. 3\u201320, quote p. 20.", "Wilson did well at school and, although he missed getting a scholarship, he obtained an exhibition; this, when topped up by a county grant, enabled him to study Modern History at Jesus College, Oxford, from 1934. At Oxford, Wilson was moderately active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party but was strongly influenced by G. D. H. Cole. His politics tutor, R. B. McCallum, considered Wilson as the best student he ever had.Kenneth O. Morgan, Labour People: Leaders and Lieutenants, Hardie to Kinnock (Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 247. He graduated in PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) with \"an outstanding first class Bachelor of Arts degree, with alphas on every paper\" in the final examinations, and a series of major academic awards.Ben Pimlott, Harold Wilson, (1993), p. 59. Biographer Roy Jenkins wrote:", "As noted by Ben Pimlott, the gap between those on lowest incomes and the rest of the population \"had been significantly reduced\" under Wilson's first government.Harold Wilson by Ben Pimlott. The first Wilson government thus saw the distribution of income became more equal, while reductions in poverty took place.Poverty in Britain, 1900\u20131965 by Ian Gazeley. These achievements were mainly brought about by several increases in social welfare benefits,Understanding Social Policy by Michael James Hill. such as supplementary benefit, pensions and family allowances, the latter of which were doubled between 1964 and 1970 (although most of the increase in family allowances did not come about until 1968). A new system of rate rebates was introduced, which benefited one million households by the end of the 1960s. Increases in national insurance benefits in 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1969 ensured that those dependent on state benefits saw their disposable incomes rise faster than manual wage earners, while income differentials between lower-income and higher-income workers were marginally narrowed. Greater progressivity was introduced in the tax system, with greater emphasis on direct (income-based) as opposed to indirect (typically expenditure-based) taxation as a means of raising revenue, with the amount raised by the former increasing twice as much as that of the latter.The Labour Party and Taxation: Party Identity and Political Purpose in Twentieth-Century Britain by Richard Whiting. Also, despite an increase in unemployment, the poor improved their share of the national income while that of the rich was slightly reduced.The Labour Party since 1945 by Eric Shaw. Despite various cutbacks after 1966, expenditure on services such as education and health was still much higher as a proportion of national wealth than in 1964. In addition, by raising taxes to pay their reforms, the government paid careful attention to the principle of redistribution, with disposable incomes rising for the lowest paid while falling amongst the wealthiest during its time in office.The Labour Party Since 1945 by Kevin Jeffreys."]}, {"page": "Harold Macmillan", "response": ["Enoch Powell claimed that it was wrong of Macmillan to seek to monopolise the advice given to the Queen in this way. In fact, this was done at the Palace's request, so that the Queen was not being seen to be involved in politics as had happened in January 1957, and had been decided as far back as June when it had looked as though the government might fall over the Profumo scandal. Ben Pimlott later described this as the \"biggest political misjudgement of her reign\".Thorpe 2010, pp. 569\u201370 the quote appears in \"The Queen\" 1996, p. 335"]}, {"page": "Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["In 1988, Goldsmiths became a full College of the University of London and in 1990 received its Royal Charter.

The school became fully co-educational in 1989. The school has also been pioneering in other fields, making a major contribution to the School Mathematics Project (from 1961) and initiating the teaching of Business Studies at A level (from 1968). In 1963 a group of boys, led by the future political biographer Ben Pimlott, wrote a book, Marlborough, an open examination written by the boys, describing life at the school.

The Channel Islands are the last remaining part of the former Duchy of Normandy to remain under the rule of the British monarch. Although the English monarchy relinquished claims to continental Normandy and other French claims in 1259 (in the Treaty of Paris), the Channel Islands (except for Chausey under French sovereignty) remain Crown dependencies of the British throne. The British historian Ben Pimlott noted that while Queen Elizabeth II was on a visit to mainland Normandy in May 1967, French locals began to doff their hats and shout \"Vive la Duchesse!\", to which the Queen supposedly replied \"Well, I am the Duke of Normandy!\". Both Channel Islands legislatures refer to Elizabeth II in writing as \"The Queen in the right of Jersey\" or \"The Queen in the right of Guernsey\" respectively. However, the Queen is referred to as \"The Duke of Normandy\", the title used by the islanders, especially during their loyal toast, where they say, \"The Duke of Normandy, our Queen\", or \"The Queen, our Duke\" or, in French \"La Reine, notre Duc\", rather than simply \"The Queen\", as is the practice in the United Kingdom."]}, {"page": "Lionel Robbins", "response": ["Robbins resumed his studies in 1920 at the London School of Economics (LSE).

Both authors asserted that there was no financial impropriety in the compilation of the list. Pimlott observed in his biography of Wilson that political secretaries often write down lists at the instructions of their employers, and that in this case the fact that the list was pink does not itself prove anything. Both Falkender and Wilson maintained that the list was Wilson's. Falkender said it was compiled on Wilson's last day in Downing Street: \"He put a pad in front of me of the pink paper that was stock paper back then and asked me to write out the names. My typewriter had been packed away so I wrote them down by hand. It really didn't feel momentous.\" "]}]}}
