She went to university in London and gained a Ph.D. degree from Charing Cross Hospital Medical School. Although living in London she spends much of her time travelling around the world co-ordinating medical trials for a small Japanese pharmaceutical company, indeed she says that her first novel Painting Ruby Tuesday (2003) was written on aeroplanes.  It concerns ten-year-old Angharad (Annie) Craddock, whose neighbours are being brutally murdered; including Mrs. Clitheroe who shared Annies love of music and her synaesthesia, as Annie puts it \"We see things in colour that aren\u2019t. Not just music. Numbers. Letters. Days of the week. People\u2019s names\". Jane Yardley herself experiences synaesthesia and it inspired her to write the book.Her novel Dancing with Dr Kildare was published by Doubleday on 2 January 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yardley", "response": ["*Jane Yardley, English 20th-century author"]}, {"page": "Imperial College School of Medicine", "response": ["* Jane Yardley, (author) Charing Cross Hospital"]}, {"page": "Charing Cross Hospital Medical School", "response": ["* Jane Yardley, author"]}, {"page": "Synesthesia", "response": ["* Synesthesia as psychological health and balance: Painting Ruby Tuesday by Jane Yardley, and A Mango-Shaped Space by Wendy Mass."]}]}}
