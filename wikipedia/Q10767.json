Hall finally made his debut for the club, coming on as a 69th-minute substitute, in a 2\u20132 draw against Bristol City on 22 September 2012. This was followed up by scoring his first goal for Watford, goal in a 3\u20132 win over Huddersfield Town. He then started in the next six matches for the club, forming a centre\u2013back partnership with Neuton and Tommie Hoban. This last until Hall suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out for weeks. He made his return from injury, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20132 draw against Blackpool on 24 November 2012. Following this, Hall started in the next six matches for the club until he suffered a hamstring injury and was substituted in the 42nd minute, during a 3\u20131 win against Brighton & Hove Albion on 29 December 2012. After being sidelined for weeks, Hall made his return from injury against Nottingham Forest on 26 January 2013, coming on as a 70th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 win. He then started in the next three matches for Watford until suffering another hamstring injury that kept him out for a month. It wasn't until on 29 March 2013 when Hall made his return to the starting line\u2013up, in a 3\u20133 draw against Burnley. However in a follow\u2013up match against Hull City, his return was short\u2013lived when Hall suffered a hamstring injury and missed the rest of the season, as the club finished third place in the league. Throughout the Championship play\u2013offs, he played once, coming against Leicester City in the semi\u2013finals first leg, as Watford lost the play\u2013off final against Crystal Palace. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Hall went on to make twenty\u2013two appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Following this, his future at the club was uncertain after yet being offered a new contract by Watford.
