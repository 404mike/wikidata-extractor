He had one match for the Stars in 1975 but most of his racing was in the National League on loan to Teesside Teessiders, for whom he did most of his racing until 1978. By 1979 he had established himself as a regular member of the King's Lynn team, averaging close to five points per match. In 1981 he transferred to Leicester Lions, where he again averaged close to five points, also riding in the National League with Stoke Potters, where he established himself as a heat leader. Two seasons with Stoke followed before he returned to Middlesbrough in 1984, the Teessiders by now renamed Middlesbrough Tigers. He moved to Long Eaton Invaders in 1985, but by 1986 was only involved in a handful of matches. After a few outings for Stoke Potters in 1986 he retired from the sport for good.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pete Smith", "response": ["Pete Smith may refer to:", "*Pete Smith (announcer) (born 1939), Australian radio and television announcer", "*Pete Smith (basketball) (born 1947), former basketball player", "*Pete Smith (baseball, born 1940), Major League Baseball pitcher, 1962\u20131963", "*Pete Smith (baseball, born 1966) , Major League Baseball pitcher, 1987\u20131998", "*Pete Smith (film producer) (1892\u20131979), film producer and narrator", "*Pete Smith (actor), New Zealand actor", "*Pete Smith (cyclist) (born 1944), British Olympic cyclist", "*Pete Smith (speedway rider, born 1942), British speedway rider ", "*Pete Smith (speedway rider, born 1957), British speedway rider"]}, {"page": "Pete Smith (speedway rider born 1957)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pete Smith (speedway rider, born 1957)"]}]}}
