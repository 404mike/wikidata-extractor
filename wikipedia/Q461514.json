Protest songs continued to increase their profile over this period, and an increasing number of artists appeared who were to have an enduring influence on the protest music genre. However, the movement and its protest singers faced increasing opposition from McCarthyism. One of the most notable pro-union protest singers of the period was Woody Guthrie (\"This Land Is Your Land\", \"Deportee\", \"1913 Massacre\", \"Dust Bowl Blues\", \"Tom Joad\"), whose guitar bore a sticker which read: \"This Machine Kills Fascists\". Guthrie was also an occasional member or the hugely influential labor-movement band The Almanac Singers, founded by Millard Lampell, Lee Hays, and Pete Seeger, which had a floating personnel. Politics and music were closely intertwined with the Almanac's Popular Front political beliefs. Their first release in May 1941, an album called Songs For John Doe, performed by Seeger, Hays, Lampell, Josh White, and Sam Gary, urged non-intervention in World War II and opposed the peacetime draft and unequal treatment of African-American draftees. A month after it was issued, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union and Roosevelt issued an order banning racial and religious discrimination in defense hiring. The Almanacs immediately switched to a pro-war position and the Songs for John Doe album was withdrawn and all copies destroyed. Their second album, Talking Union, was a collection six labor songs: \"Union Maid\", \"I Don't Want Your Millions Mister\", \"Get Thee Behind Me Satan\", \"Union Train\", \"Which Side Are You On?\", and, of course, the eponymous \"Talking Union\", sung by Guthrie, who had joined the group in July. This album, issued in July 1941, was not anti-Roosevelt. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December of that year, the Almanacs issued a strongly pro-war, pro-Roosevelt album, Dear Mr. President, that included Guthrie's \"Reuben James\" (1942), and several of them enlisted in the Army (Seeger) or Merchant Marine (Guthrie and Cisco Houston). The Almanacs were widely criticized in the press for switching positions, especially by Dr. Carl Joachim Friedrich, a Harvard political scientist who was in charge of military propaganda for domestic consumption and wrote prolifically for popular magazines.See  \"The Poison in Our System\" (excerpt) by Carl Joachim Friedrich, Atlantic Monthly (June, 1941)."]}, {"page": "Marunouchi Sadistic", "response": ["* Piano: Reuben James"]}, {"page": "Soho Radio", "response": ["* Reuben James"]}]}}
