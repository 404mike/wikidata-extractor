Further minor hits followed with \"Shockaholic\", which preceded their eponymous debut album, \"Going Out With God\", by which time Pardon had been replaced by Nick Powell, and \"10 Second Bionic Man\", before their second album, Bent, was released in 1994. They toured with Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Manic Street Preachers, and drew comparisons with Pulp and Mott the Hoople, with Allmusic identifying influences from glam rock, punk rock, and Sergeant Pepper-era Beatles, and The Encyclopedia of Popular Music author Colin Larkin also comparing the band to The Only Ones.Parisien, Roch \"[ Kinky Machine Review]\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-11-15 They moved on to East West Records for a final single, \"London Crawling\", before splitting up in 1995 after Fenton had joined The Lightning Seeds, to be briefly replaced by Anthony Christmas. They had become disillusioned with the Britpop sound, with several of the bands that had supported them in the past (including Supergrass and Elastica) overtaking them and becoming prime movers in the scene, Eliot explaining \"When we started, we were delving into British pop music for influences, from the Kinks and the Jam and Clash to the Beatles.
