He is one of the series' original characters and made his debut in the first episode broadcast on 16 October 1972. Pyne was interviewed for the role in 1971 and cast the following year. He came into the show with farming knowledge and an expectation that he would only be in it for five years. Matt is a sheep farmer and married to Peggy Skilbeck (Jo Kendall) at the beginning of the serial. Matt is characterised as mild-mannered, honest, and stubborn, although Pyne thought his character was too nice. Following Peggy's death and those of his children, Matt marries barmaid Dolly Acaster (Katharine Barker; Jean Rogers). A change in Matt's personality occurs when quarry owner Harry Mowlem (Godfrey James) makes advances towards Dolly and Matt attacks him, leading to his arrest for Mowlem's murder. Pyne decided to leave Emmerdale in 1989 to pursue work in the theatre. He was unhappy that the writers chose to split Matt and Dolly up, as they had been one of the few remaining happy families in soap at the time.", "A different side to the normally laid back character emerges when Harry Mowlem (Godfrey James) begins making advances towards Dolly. Matt later attacks the quarry owner and Pyne justified his character's actions, explaining: \"Mowlem was such a monster that even the most placid person would lose their temper.\" Matt is arrested for manslaughter when Mowlem is found dead, but he is released when criminal Derek Warner (Dennis Blanch) later admits to Mowlem's murder.Parkin 2002, p.68."]}, {"page": "State of Revolution", "response": ["*Godfrey James ...
