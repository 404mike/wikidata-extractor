The club spent its formative years playing mainly in the Division d'Honneur Sud-Est. In 1925, the club was managed by Scotsman Victor Gibson. That same year, Montpellier endured an internal crisis after the French Football Federation discovered that the club had been guilty of financial misfeasance. The club's president was suspended from football for five years and Montpellier were relegated for the first time. The resulting penalties led to the departure of several players. In an effort to rebuild, the club changed its name to Sports Olympiques Montpelli\u00e9rains and recruited several new players, most notably Branislav Sekuli\u0107, Roger Rolhion, and the three Kramer brothers from Switzerland. The rebuilding process was immediate as the club returned to the Division d'Honneur after one season. In 1929, the club won its first major trophy, the Coupe de France. In the final, Montpellier faced FC S\u00e8te and recorded a 2\u20130 victory courtesy of goals from Auguste Kramer and Edmond Kramer.", "| Victor Gibson"]}, {"page": "List of Olympique de Marseille managers and presidents", "response": ["|1926\u20131927 || Victor Gibson"]}]}}
