King Henry III appropriated the advowson of the church, when he seized the lands of Maelgwn ap Maelgwn, called Maelgwn Fychan, the son of Maelgwn ap Rhys, possibly to help pay the construction costs of the new church, though the seizure was contrary to the Gloucester Abbey claims and Gilbert fitz Richard's charters.Frank Lewis, \"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15\u201340, at p. 17; Sir John Edward Lloyd, The Story of Ceredigion 400\u20131277 (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), pp. 34\u201335.

In this part of the work is a preface known as the Enucleatio libelli, where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work. Another section, known as the Prefatio istius libelli, now much later in the manuscript but possibly meant as an introduction to the Codicellus, is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection.Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" Early Medieval Europe p. 239 Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work,Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England p. 35Williams English and the Norman Conquest p. 145 but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, Samson. Historian Nicholas Brooks, along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work was a response to the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the cartulary was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop. The historian Julia Barrow believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the Domesday Book in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death.
