He is known for playing head of MI5, Stephen Hunter-Dunn in the BBC's Bodyguard, his regular appearances as Sergeant Thomson in Gary: Tank Commander, and for his portrayal of Alexandre Bontemps in the Canal+ series Versailles.\nBowman was an established character actor on television, but his role as Bontemps raised his public profile. It necessitated living in Paris for the three years that Versailles took to film. Afterwards he said that he did not regret the conclusion of the series. \"With Bontemps I don't think there was much I would be able to do with him beyond season three...So, for me, it felt right and natural that it was finishing there.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rangers F.C.", "response": ["Rangers have appeared in theatre a number of times in shows such as Follow Follow: The Rangers Story at the King's Theatre in 1994 starring Scottish actors Barbara Rafferty, Alexander Morton, Jonathan Watson, Iain Robertson, Ronnie Letham and Stuart Bowman; Singin' I'm No A Billy He's A Tim at the Pavilion Theatre in 2009; Divided City at the Citizens Theatre in 2011; and, more recently, Billy and Tim and the Wee Glesga Ghost in 2015, and Rally Roon the Rangers in 2019, both at the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow."]}, {"page": "The Wisdom of Crocodiles", "response": ["* Stuart Bowman as Car Crash Mechanic"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish actors", "response": ["*Stuart Bowman"]}, {"page": "Alexandre Bontemps", "response": ["*Bontemps, played by Stuart Bowman, has a large part (if sparing with words) in Versailles, the 2015 British-Franco-Canadian television series drama set around the construction of the palace.
