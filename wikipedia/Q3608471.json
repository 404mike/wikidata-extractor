St. Paul's RC was designed by architects Gillespie, Kidd and Coia. In 1993 it was listed as one of sixty key monuments of post-war architecture by the international conservation organisation DoCoMoMo. The church sits at a junction between two main distributor roads. St Columba's Church, designed by architects Wheeler & Sproson, underwent significant restoration in 2009. Internally the church contains a large mural created by Alberto Morrocco titled 'The Way of the Cross', which was completed in 1962. Externally the church with its distinctive triangular iron bell tower and Mondrian inspired stained glass windows acts as a landmark at the south-western gateway to the town centre."]}, {"page": "List of Aberdonians", "response": ["*Alberto Morrocco (1917\u20131998), artist and teacher"]}, {"page": "Italian Scots", "response": ["* Alberto Morrocco, artist"]}, {"page": "The McManus", "response": ["The building was closed to the public on 24 October 2005 for a \u00a37.8-million redevelopment by Page\\Park Architects and was reopened to the public on 28 February 2010.

McClure had a strong adherence to the core values of sound drawing, the importance of tradition, art history, and learning the craft of painting. He found time to work with students who were less gifted and was appreciated for his rigorous intellect which made an impact on the college. He is remembered at Duncan of Jordanstone for opening the minds of staff and students alike and spent the last two years of his career there as head of painting a post he took over from his great friend, colleague and fellow Scottish artist, Alberto Morrocco, before retiring in 1985. After his retirement from College, David continued to paint full-time in his studio at the family home at Strawberry Bank, Dundee. During this period he periodically suffered from ill-health, but not until the very end did this affect his painting indeed in his last years he produced what some regard as some of the finest, direct landscapes of his career inspired by summer visits to North-West Sutherland.

In 1936 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy (ARSA) and in 1943 a full member (RSA). While at Gray's, he undertook a large-scale painting project consisting of larger-than-life murals in a lecture and exhibition hall within the Aberdeen University Union on Gallowgate. This project involved three of his pupils (Albert Morrocco, Taylor Bremner, and James Hillocks) in an effort that began in 1938 and continued until his retirement in 1953, being interrupted by World War II. During the war Sivell completed a number of short-term commissions for the War Artists Advisory Committee.
