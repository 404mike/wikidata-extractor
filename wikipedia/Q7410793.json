In 1894 he became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in 1908 he was made Gresham Professor of Astronomy giving public lectures on the subject.Saunder was one of the first to use photography of the Moon to measure and triangulate its features. He was also responsible for pointing out the confused state of lunar nomenclature at the beginning of the 20th century, and initiating the process of standardizing the names of lunar features. The crater Saunder on the Moon was named after him in 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saunder (crater)", "response": ["Saunder is a lunar impact crater located in the central highland region of the Moon, to the east-northeast of the walled plain Hipparchus. Its diameter is 44\u00a0km. It was named after British mathematician Samuel Arthur Saunder. The outer wall is irregular and broken in several locations, forming the overall shape of a pentagon. The interior of Saunder has been flooded with lava, forming a level surface just below the rim. The floor lacks a central peak, but there are low rises in the southeast quadrant and a tiny craterlet towards the north rim."]}, {"page": "List of craters on the Moon: R\u2013S", "response": ["| Saunder ||  || align=right | 44.38 || align=center | 1935 || Samuel Arthur Saunder (1852\u20131912) || "]}, {"page": "Gresham Professor of Astronomy", "response": ["|  19 ||Samuel Arthur Saunder || 2 December 1908"]}, {"page": "Samuel arthur saunder", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Arthur Saunder "]}, {"page": "List of people with craters of the Moon named after them", "response": ["* Samuel Arthur Saunder"]}, {"page": "Samuel Saunder", "response": ["#Redirect Samuel Arthur Saunder"]}]}}
