However, they explicitly ruled out the notion that the band was breaking up and also alluded toward potential solo material from frontman Jack Steadman and from bassist Ed Nash. However, in an interview with Q Nash recalled Steadman saying that he did not think he wanted to make another Bombay Bicycle Club album. In January 2017, Nash released the solo album The Pace of the Passing under the moniker Toothless. It featured Marika Hackman, Tom Fleming, Liz Lawrence and Bombay Bicycle Club drummer Suren de Saram. The album was produced by Nash and Steadman. In March 2017, Steadman formed the solo project Mr Jukes, releasing the album God First in July 2017. The album was produced by Steadman and featured BJ the Chicago Kid, Elli Ingram, Charles Bradley, De La Soul, Horace Andy, Lalah Hathaway, Lianne La Havas. During the band's hiatus, guitarist Jamie MacColl completed an undergraduate degree in war studies at King's College London and a MPhil in international relations at the University of Cambridge. He worked as an intelligence analyst for a social security company and also worked at a think tank in Washington, D.C.. He also launched Undivided, a Brexit campaign group to engage with people under the age of 30. Nash worked for some time in an office job in the interim. Steadman traveled extensively, including traveling on the Trans-Siberian Railway as well as riding on a cargo ship from China to Canada."]}, {"page": "2013 UK Music Video Awards", "response": ["* Elli Ingram \u2013 \"Mad Love\""]}]}}
