The design was noted for its reliability because in the period from May 1952 until February 1953 it averaged 80 hours per week running time. Dr Jack Howlett, Director of the Computer Laboratory at AERE 1948\u201361, said it \"could be left unattended for long periods; I think the record was over one Christmas-New Year holiday when it was all by itself, with miles of input data on punched tape to keep it happy, for at least ten days and was still ticking away when we came back.\" It was the machine's untiring durability, rather than its speed, that was its main feature. Human mathematicians (a job role called a \"hand-computer\") could make calculations at a similar speed, but not continuously for the same lengths of time.
