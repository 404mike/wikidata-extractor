He was a right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper who represented Gloucestershire (1973\u20131990), Marylebone Cricket Club (1976) and Orange Free State (1974/75\u20131975/76).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Swetman", "response": ["Surprisingly retiring from county cricket after the 1961 season, he returned in 1966 to play for Nottinghamshire. Again leaving rather abruptly, this time in 1967, he emerged as a replacement for Barry Meyer at Gloucestershire in 1972, but left when replaced by Andy Stovold in 1974."]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1977", "response": ["Thankfully for the tourists Gloucestershire were even poorer. After an opening stand of 36 from Sadiq Mohammad and Andy Stovold, Max Walker and Mick Malone made short work of their batting line-up. It took the Australian opening pair just 22.5 overs to have Gloucestershire all out for a paltry 63. Walker took an impressive 7/19 off 11.5, and Malone, 3/43 off 11 overs.", "Australia again started with a wobble, losing McCosker for 4 in the third over, but a 42 run partnership between Chappell and Ian Davis got them back on track. Davis eventually went for 18, but that brought Kim Hughes to the crease. Although scoring less prolifically, Hughes capably supported Chappell as he moved towards a well-deserved century, falling on 102. It was enough to prop up the Australian second innings, and solid contributions from Hughes (27), Doug Walters (24), Richie Robinson (26), and Max Walker (22) took Australia to 251 all out. Gloucestershire required an unlikely 343 for victory, and never looked like they would reach the target. Andy Stovold made 27, and Jim Foat and David Shepherd both chipped in with 26 each, but Gloucentershire were all out for 169. Len Pascoe (4/36) and Ray Bright (4/63) were the pick of the Australian bowlers, as they wrapped up a deserved victory by 173 runs in two days."]}, {"page": "Andrew Brassington", "response": ["A lower-order right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper, Brassington was a regular in the Gloucestershire first-class side between 1978 and 1982, but played less frequently in one-day matches because Andy Stovold was a far better batsman and an adequate wicketkeeper. He played seldom after 1982 because of the emergence of Jack Russell as a wicketkeeper-batsman."]}, {"page": "Courages Sports Ground", "response": ["Established prior to 1961, the first cricket match recorded at the ground is in 1964 when Courages Cricket Club played Calmore Sports. Berkshire first played at the ground in the 1975 Minor Counties Championship against Wiltshire. Berkshire played seven further Minor Counties Championship matches at the ground, the last of which came against Wiltshire in 1983. Two MCCA Knockout Trophy matches were played there in 1984 between Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. The first match ended in no result, with the second match won by Berkshire a replay. A single List A match was played there in the 1986 NatWest Trophy between Berkshire and Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire batted first and made 249/9 from their sixty overs, with Andy Stovold top scoring in the innings with 58, while Peter Lewington's 3/23 were the best bowling figures of the innings. Berkshire were dismissed for 129 to lose the match by 120 runs, with Mark Simmons' 26 the top score in Berkshire's innings, while David Lawrence took figures of 4/36. This was the last time Berkshire played at the ground, with the final recorded match to be played there coming in 1990."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Andy Stovold (1973\u20131990) : A.
