It absorbed the Manchester Times in 1848 and from June 1855, by now being run by George Wilson, the newspaper was published every morning at a price of one penny. The price was set to undercut rivals such as the Manchester Guardian and did so for some time until the rivals responded. Despite this competitive advantage, and in common with many other local newspapers, its influence in London was low and it suffered from difficulties in distribution. In 1856, Richard Cobden was inspired to become involved in establishing the Morning Star  in London as an imitator of the Manchester Examiner that would disseminate the school of Manchester radicalism more widely, but it was of an inferior journalistic standard and had little political impact."]}]}}
