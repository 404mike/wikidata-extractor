Pif argues that \"This exhibition is a usurpation\"  (\"Questa manifestazione \u00e8 abusiva\") because it does not recognize that Shakespeare was a Sicilian called Guglielmo (William) Scrollalanza, and that he wrote originally not \"To be or not to be\" but (in Sicilian dialect) \"Iessere  o nun iessere\". The British ambassador Christopher Prentice appears briefly in the interview, and responds, with understated sardonic humour, to Pif's claims. However, this interview was clearly a joke around the Scrollalanza theory, in which the RAI journalist, Pif (nickname for Pierfrancesco Diliberto) and Christopher Prentice clearly enjoyed playing their respective role."]}, {"page": "Prentice, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Prentice"]}]}}
