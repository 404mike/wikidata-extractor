In the meantime, despite the club being pitted as favourites for the title by numerous bookmakers at the outset of the season, Derry City made a poor start, losing to strong title-contenders St. Patrick's Athletic and Drogheda United in their early-season confrontations. They also fell to Cork City at home in the fifth series of games to a score-line of 4\u20131.

Having won only three games from nine competitive matches prior to this game, Pat Jennings Jr., the goalkeeper, was viewed as being at fault for quite a number of Derry's conceded goals and was dropped for Ola Tidman to make his debut. Conceding four goals on his debut, however, Tidman also failed to inspire confidence as the club seemed to be missing David Forde following his pre-season departure to Cardiff City. The team in general appeared to be lacking in the drive and tenacity that was once present under Stephen Kenny and were failing to create clear-cut, goal-scoring chances.
