Further political divide between the two cities was caused by the Welsh devolution referendum in 1997 when Cardiff was chosen as the site for the newly created Senedd, despite the majority of the city voting against devolution. Swansea, which largely voted in favour of devolution, received funding for a national swimming pool instead.

It seems to me that everything gets channelled in that direction\". Away fans were eventually allowed to attend the fixture again in 1997 under strict monitoring and the introduction of 'bubble' trips, where away fans are escorted in and out of the stadium by police. The two teams were split in 1999 through promotions and relegation. Although they met in a FAW Premier Cup final in 2002, the two sides did not meet in the league for ten years.
