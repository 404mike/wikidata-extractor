Clark (born 1940) is a designer, design historian, model rocketeer and curator whose designs established his reputation with the birth of British pop culture in the 1960s. By printing silk-screened Pop decoration onto cheap, mass-produced products, Clark was among a group of young designers who undermined accepted ideas of good taste, by elevating everyday items into fashionable objects. Clark's interest in science and space travel led him to create model rockets for international competitions as well as commercial model rocket kits. He is the founder of the British Space Modelling Association.His archive is located at the University of Brighton Design Archives.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Clark", "response": ["Paul Clark may refer to:", "* Paul Clark (composer) (born 1968), British composer", "* Paul Clark (designer) (born 1940), British designer", "* Paul Clark (educator) (born 1954), American labor historian and educator", "* Paul Clark (keyboardist) (born 1962), British keyboardist and electronic musician", "* Paul Clark (poker player) (1947\u20132015), professional poker player", "* Paul Clark (politician) (born 1957), politician in the United Kingdom", "* Paul Clark (Christian musician), Christian musician", "* Paul Clark (footballer) (born 1958), English association football player", "* Paul Clark (presenter) (born 1953), Northern Irish television presenter and journalist", "* Paul Clark (judge) (1940\u20132008), circuit judge in the United Kingdom", "* Paul Clark (athlete) (born 1950s), Canadian Paralympic athlete", "* Paul Clarke (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "University of Brighton Design Archives", "response": ["The archives of Bernard Schottlander, Paul Clark, and Barbara Jones, designers from different periods each having connections with the Design Council's work.
