The first Chief Whip, Vic Gould, was played by Edward Jewesbury in two episodes of Yes Minister.Opening episode, \"Open Government\", broadcast on 25 February 1980 Gould was initially intended to be a more prominent character in the series, as the writers thought he would continually force Hacker to pursue policies unappealing to Sir Humphrey, and thus lead to greater conflict.  They quickly found that Gould's character was largely unnecessary, and that the Hacker/Sir Humphrey conflicts worked just as well without him. In \"Party Games\", a later Chief Whip, played by James Grout and identified as \"Jeffrey\", conspires with Sir Humphrey to ensure that Hacker becomes Prime Minister. In 2 episodes of Yes, Prime Minister, Jeffrey is now played by Peter Cartwright. (In the novelizations, the character is given the full name of Jeffrey Pearson.)  Jeffrey is clueless about an alleged Cabinet plot against the Prime Minister ... because there is none, and Hacker is pursuing a false trail laid by Sir Humphrey.
