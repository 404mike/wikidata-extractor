One source refers to Merope as Oenopion's wife, not his daughter. Another refers to Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion.Kerenyi, Gods of the Greeks, pp. 201\u2013204; for Merope as the wife of Oenopion, he cites the scholiast on Nicander, Theriaca 15. Frazer's notes to Apollodorus. The longest version (a page in the Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman Cornelius Gallus to make into Latin verse.Parthenius, Love Romances XX; LCL, with Longus' Daphnis and Chloe. Unlike most of Parthenius' stories, no source is noted in the MS. It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called A\u00ebro or Leiro.Both are emendations of Parthenius's text, which is Haero; A\u00ebro is from Stephen Gaselee's Loeb edition; Leiro \"lily\" is from J. L. Lightfoot's 1999 edition of Parthenius, p.495, which records the several emendations suggested by other editors, which include Maero and Merope. \"Leiro\" is supported by a Hellenistic inscription from Chios, which mentions a Liro as a companion of Oenopion. Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot."]}, {"page": "List of librarians", "response": ["*Stephen Gaselee \u2013 diplomat"]}, {"page": "Oxford poetry anthologies", "response": ["* Oxford Book of Medieval Latin Verse (1928) edited by Stephen Gaselee."]}, {"page": "Leucippe and Clitophon", "response": ["There are translations in many languages.
