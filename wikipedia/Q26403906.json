It is thought the name Cill Rois is derived from Church of the Wood, which would fit with the church ruins location. It was not until the 18th century that it underwent major development.  This development coincided with the succession of John Ormsby Vandeleur as the wealthiest landlord in the district. Of Dutch origin, the Vandeleur family was the most prominent landlord family in West Clare. They designed the layout of the town and many of the present-day street names derive from Vandeleur family names.", "John Ormsby Vandeleur built the large family home, Kilrush House in 1808. He owned much of Kilrush. With wealth achieved from a financially beneficial marriage and some political skulduggery, he decided to develop the town. A Scots businessman James Paterson, who had been a gunboat lieutenant until 1802, assisted him in this project. Paterson entered the oats trade in west Clare and in 1802 he was given a site on the square from Vandeleur and erected a six-storey building.", "However, the famine years (1845\u20131849) brought much hardship to Kilrush. Famine, evictions, fever and cholera reduced the population of south-west Clare to such an extent that it never again attained its pre-famine numbers.  This was vividly dramatised for radio in 1980. In the post-famine era, the Vandeleur name became synonymous with the worst of landlord evictions, with over 20,000 evicted in the Kilrush Union. The Kilrush workhouse witnessed terrible deprivation and deaths. By that stage, Hector Vandeleur had succeeded John Ormsby Vandeleur."]}, {"page": "Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Ormsby Vandeleur"]}, {"page": "Ennis (Parliament of Ireland constituency)", "response": ["| John Ormsby Vandeleur "]}, {"page": "Carlow Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" | John Ormsby Vandeleur"]}, {"page": "Members of the 1st UK Parliament from Ireland", "response": ["| John Ormsby Vandeleur"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors of Ireland", "response": ["*John Ormsby Vandeleur (c. 1765\u20131828) "]}, {"page": "Vandeleur", "response": ["* Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur (British Army officer) (1763\u20131849), British Army General who fought in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars", "* John Ormsby Vandeleur (Ennis MP) (1765\u20131828), Irish landowner and politician, MP for Ennis and Carlow", "* John Ormsby Vandeleur (MP for Granard) (1767\u20131822), Irish politician, MP for Granard 1790\u20131798"]}, {"page": "Crofton Moore Vandeleur", "response": ["He was the oldest son of John Ormsby Vandeleur of Kilrush, who had been an MP in both the pre-union Parliament of Ireland and then in the union parliament.
