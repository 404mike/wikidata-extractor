The orchestra under Heward also began to attract front-rank soloists: Arthur de Greef and Nikolai Orlov performed in 1931; Artur Schnabel played Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto in 1933; Ernst Wolff, Arthur Catterall, Egon Petri, Frederic Lamond performed in 1934; Adolf Busch and Solomon in 1936; and in 1938 B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k played one of his own Piano Concertos."]}, {"page": "Grantown-on-Spey", "response": ["* Nikolai Orlov, Russian-born pianist"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists", "response": ["* Nikolai Orlov"]}, {"page": "Nikolai Andreyevich Orlov", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nikolai Orlov (pianist)"]}, {"page": "Nikolay Orlov", "response": ["*Nikolai Orlov (painter) (1863-1924), Russian painter", "*Nikolai Orlov (pianist) (1892\u20131964), Russian pianist"]}, {"page": "1964 in Scotland", "response": ["* 31 May \u2013 Nikolai Orlov, classical pianist (born 1892 in Russia)"]}]}}
