The landowning interest in the Party, under its leader, William Miles MP for East Somerset, had called upon Disraeli to lead the Party. Disraeli had declined, though pledged support to the Country Gentlemen's Interes, as Bentink had offered to lead if he had Disraeli's support. Disraeli stated, in a letter to Sir William Miles of 11 June 1860, that he wished to help \"because, from my earliest years, my sympathies had been with the landed interest of England\".", "Blake comments that Disraeli \"produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further he wrote a discourse on political theory and a political biography, the Life of Lord George Bentinck, which is excellent\u00a0... remarkably fair and accurate.\"Blake, Robert in Hartley, p. 1 But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged.O'Kell, Robert. \"Disraeli's Novels Reviewed, 1826\u20131968, by R.

Stewart observed that there have always been two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels\u2014one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, \"It is after all, even if you are a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, no matter how much you deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one.\"", "* Lord George Bentinck (1852)"]}, {"page": "Epsom Derby", "response": ["The starting point of the race was moved twice during the 19th century.
