When, in 1791, the Drury Lane company migrated to the King's Theatre (Opera House) in the Haymarket, Chatterley accompanied it, but played no character sufficiently important to have his name mentioned. On 1 February 1795, after the return of the company, he is first publicly heard of playing Carlos in an ill-starred tragedy by Bertie Greatheed, entitled the 'Regent.' \nOn 24 September 1796 he played the Child in 'Isabella,' a version by Garrick of Southerne's 'Fatal Marriage,' to the Isabella of Mrs. Siddons. \nThrough the recommendation of Bannister he assumed youthful characters in Birmingham, and took part in private theatricals. \nHis connection with Drury Lane was maintained until 1804, when he accepted a country engagement. \nAt Cheltenham he made a success in what is technically called leading business. Palmer and Dimond secured him in 1810 for the Bath theatre, of which they were managers. \nHere he married, on 11 August 1813, Miss Louisa Simeon, an actress, who was known as Louisa Chatterley and whose reputation remained at least on a level with his own. He reappeared in 1816 in London at the Lyceum. \nIrregularity of life interfered with his success, and after accepting temporary engagements at the Adelphi, the Olympic, the Surrey, and other theatres, he died at Lynn in Norfolk in 1822, a victim of most forms of excess, particularity alcohol abuse.In Bath, he played such characters as Sir Anthony Absolute, Launcelot Gobbo, Foresight in 'Love for Love,' Sir Solomon Sadlips in The Double Gallant. In London, his great character was Justice Woodcock, in which he came only behind Munden and Dowton. \nHe 'created,' on 24 May 1799, the r\u00f4le of the boy in 'Pizarro.' Mrs. Chatterley, who was an agreeable actress in comedy, had the reputation of being the best representative of a Frenchwoman on the English stage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chatterley", "response": ["* William Simmonds Chatterley (1787\u20131822), English actor"]}, {"page": "George Daniel (writer)", "response": ["On 21 July 1818 a 'serio-comick-bombastick-operatick interlude' by Daniel, entitled 'Doctor Bolus,' was acted at the English Opera House (afterwards the Lyceum) with great success. The principal parts were filled by Fanny Kelly, John Pritt Harley, and William Simmonds Chatterley, and Harley became one of Daniel's friends. The piece was printed soon after its performance, and went through two editions.

The two of them both enjoyed some success. Louisa took the name \"Mrs Chatterley\" and worked regularly in comedic roles in Bath and London. It was said that she was particularly adept at playing a French woman. She appeared in well known plays including The Rivals, She Stoops to Conquer, and Twelve Precisely, where Chatterley was required to play twelve different roles as she tests the character of a lover.
