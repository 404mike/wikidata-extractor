These calls were proven to have been made both from her Kensington Palace apartment and from the phone box just outside the palace. According to Hoare's obituary, there was little doubt she had been in a relationship with him. However, Diana denied any romantic relationship with Hoare, whom she described as a friend, and said that \"a young boy\" was the source of the nuisance calls made to Hoare. She was also linked by the press to rugby union player Will Carling and private equity investor Theodore J. Forstmann, yet these claims were neither confirmed nor proven."]}, {"page": "Quorn", "response": ["The initial advertising campaign for Quorn featured sports personalities, including footballer Ryan Giggs, rugby player Will Carling, and Olympic runner Sally Gunnell.

Gregan was also the world's most capped player until being surpassed by Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll in 2014. Gregan also equalled the record for the most caps as captain with Will Carling, 59 caps (a record later to be broken by John Smit of South Africa). David Campese scored 64 Test tries in his career, which was a world record until Daisuke Ohata of Japan overtook him with 69 tries, and Michael Lynagh was the highest Test points scorer in world rugby with 911 until Neil Jenkins of Wales overtook him with 1037 points.

He played in the 1970s, but, if he played now, he would still be the best. He was outstanding at running, passing, kicking and reading the game.

He was best known as a superlative leader, motivating England to a remarkable three Grand Slams in five years, including back to back slams in 1991 and 1992. He also led England to the final of the 1991 World Cup, and captained the Barbarians FC. His playing talents were not as flamboyant as some of his colleagues, but his effectiveness cemented him as a first choice at centre. It is possible he would already be in the Hall of Fame were it not for outspoken tendencies with respect to the English RFU committee (\"Old Farts\"), who may, as a result, be reluctant to acknowledge his achievements. He was made an OBE in 1991. Carling is not, however, the youngest England captain of all time; that honour goes to Frederic Stokes, who captained England against Scotland on 27 March 1871 aged just 20 years and 258 days."]}, {"page": "Phil de Glanville", "response": ["He made his England debut as a replacement in the match against the Springboks in 1992. Many of de Glanville's international caps were earned in a replacement role, as the incumbent centres were Will Carling (long-serving England captain) and Jeremy Guscott. De Glanville is seen as likely to have won many more caps if it weren't for this firmly entrenched Carling-Guscott combination, a pairing solidified by early Carling-Guscott successes like the 1991 Rugby World Cup.", "In the Autumn of 1996 coach Jack Rowell appointed him as England captain following Will Carling's decision to step-down, following England's 1996 Five Nations Championship win. However, there was criticism of his inclusion in the starting XV for the 1997 Five Nations as it wasn't felt that he was in good enough form to be guaranteed a place in the team. He was not selected for that summer's Lions tour to South Africa losing his place to uncapped Will Greenwood. Under new coach Clive Woodward in autumn 1997 he lost both the captaincy to Lawrence Dallaglio and his starting position to Greenwood, though he remained a valued squad member. He showed some very good form in the 1999 world cup, particularly in the pool game against New Zealand. In total he won 38 caps for England and started in the centre throughout the 1994/1995 season, including an outstanding performance in the first tour to South Africa after apartheid, where he played in both test matches."]}, {"page": "Will Greenwood", "response": ["He left Harlequins and moved to Leicester Tigers in 1996 because the presence of England centre Will Carling meant he could not get first team rugby."]}, {"page": "Zinzan Brooke", "response": ["In 2007, former England centre and captain Will Carling published his list of the '50 Greatest Rugby players' in The Daily Telegraph, and ranked Brooke the ninth greatest player of all time, stating: \"For a forward his skills were outrageous.

As de Glanville was thereby guaranteed a place in the team, Carling was moved from inside centre to outside centre and Guscott was relegated to the bench. Such was Guscott's talent and form at the time that even Carling noted in his autobiography that it was an extraordinary decision for then England Coach, Jack Rowell, to make. In the 1996 Five Nations, Guscott famously came off the bench to play on the wing against each of Ireland and Wales; in each instance sparking the squad's confidence and playing direct roles in their triumphs."]}, {"page": "Hatfield College, Durham", "response": ["Will Carling, Will Greenwood, and Marcus Rose are the most notable former undergraduates, all of whom made multiple appearances for England and participated in various editions of the Rugby World Cup.
