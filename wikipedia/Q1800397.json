In \"New Earth\" (2006), Rose's body is temporarily inhabited by Cassandra, who kisses the Doctor romantically. This is one of the few scenes in the entire programme where the Doctor is kissed romantically by his companion. In \"School Reunion\" (2006), the arrival of the Doctor's previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. The Doctor also expresses dismay at having his companions age while he regenerates. In the episode, \"The Girl in the Fireplace\" (2006) (written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor develops a romantic relationship with Madame de Pompadour, with whom he shares a passionate kiss. She even takes him away to \"dance\", but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode \"The Doctor Dances\") is taken is not seen on screen. Rose does not openly exhibit jealousy towards Madame de Pompadour. In the novel The Stone Rose, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, with it being described as \"a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive\".

A new arrangement of the theme tune was composed by Murray Gold. Gardner later commented that the choice of Cardiff as the base for filming the series was the result of a combination of factors.

In an interview in Doctor Who Magazine, Russell T Davies stated that an alternate ending for this episode was written and filmed, with the intention that it would be shown to press previewers to hide the secret of the regeneration. The \"false\" ending would have featured similar dialogue to the televised final scene, but the TARDIS would have scanned Rose and the viewers would have seen the display read: \"LIFEFORM DYING\". Davies considered this scene inferior to the one actually shown but suggested that it might be suitable as an extra on a DVD someday.

In the episode after assuming responsibility for the destructive time paradox, Pete assures Rose \"I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault\".

On meeting him, Barrowman tried out the character using his native Scottish accent, his normal American accent, and an English accent; Davies decided it \"made it bigger if it was an American accent\". Barrowman recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a \"matin\u00e9e idol quality\", telling him that \"the only one in the whole of Britain who could do it was you\". A number of television critics have compared Barrowman's performances as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.", "During Jack's initial appearances in Doctor Who, Russell T Davies held a \"half-hearted\" theory that Jack would dress specific to the time period he was in, to contrast the Doctor who dresses the same wherever and whenever he goes. He is introduced wearing a greatcoat in World War II-set episodes, but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode \"Boom Town\" and black leather in futuristic episodes. Davies admits that this was a \"bit of a lame idea\" and decided that Jack \"never looked better than when he was in his World War II outfit\". From the pilot of Torchwood onwards, Harkness once again wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a Torchwood Magazine interview that \"We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour.\" Because the character was expected to \"be running around a lot\", Holman redesigned his RAF group captain's greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid and less \"weighty\". Jack's other costumes are \"loosely wartime based\", such as the trousers are \"getting more and more styled to suit his figure\". Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show. The \"hero version\" is used for most scenes, while there is also a wetcoat made with pre-shrunk fabric, running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught, and two \"stunt coats\" that had been \"hero coats\" in the first series.\" Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character \"likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity\". Julie Gardner describes the coat as \"epic and classic and dramatic\", while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack \"a sweep and a presence\".", "A press release for Torchwood Series Four states that Jack is brought back to Earth because of his \"unstated love\" for Gwen, who in turn still feels for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led beside him.Torchwood The New World, Press Release.

Episode seven of Miracle Day features a scene where Jack threatens Gwen with violence after she states she would have him killed to save her daughter. Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters have different needs and that this means they inevitably \"clash like steel blades\". Simon Brew of Den of Geek praises the dynamic between Gwen and Jack in series four, describing them as \"a terrific double act\" and states that \"Torchwood is at, or near, its best when the two of them are working in tandem\".", "Following the character's initial introduction in the revived series 1 of Doctor Who, the character became incredibly popular with fans, to the extent that Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner created a spin-off series, Torchwood, primarily centred around the character. The Times described the undeniable success of the character as having propelled actor John Barrowman to \"National Treasure status\". For his role as Captain Jack, John Barrowman was nominated for Best Actor at the 2007 BAFTA Cymru Awards, and again for Children of Earth at the 2010 TV Choice Awards, against Eleventh Doctor actor Matt Smith. Harkness was also listed number nine in TV Squad's \"Ten Most mysterious characters on television\", behind the Tenth Doctor, who was listed number three. John Barrowman, who is himself gay, has ranked in the Independent on Sunday Pink List, a list of the most influential gay people in Britain, in 2007, 2008, and 2009 with the Independent commenting that \"Proof of his popularity came with the continued runaway success of his bisexual Captain Jack Harkness on Russell T Davies's Torchwood\".
