She won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her role as the Duchess of Brighton in The V.I.P.s (1963). In the early 1960s she starred as Agatha Christie's character Miss Marple in a series of four George Pollock films. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1961 and a Dame Commander (DBE) in 1967.", "In the early 1960s, she appeared as Miss Jane Marple in a series of four George Pollock films loosely based on the novels of Agatha Christie. The films depicted Marple as a colourful character, respectable but bossy and eccentric. Authors Marion Shaw and Sabine Vanacker in their book Reflecting on Miss Marple (1991) complained that the emphasis on the \"dotty element in the character\" missed entirely \"the quietness and sharpness\" that was admired in the novels. The actress, then aged in her 70s, insisted on wearing her own clothes for the part and having her husband appear alongside her. In 1963 Christie dedicated her novel The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side \"To Margaret Rutherford in admiration\", though the novelist too was critical of the films for diverging from her original plots and playing dramatic scenes for laughs. Rutherford reprised the role of Miss Marple in a very brief, uncredited cameo in the 1965 film The Alphabet Murders."]}, {"page": "1979 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 22 || George Pollock || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 72 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Director || "]}, {"page": "1963 in film", "response": ["*Murder at the Gallop (1963), a Miss Marple film directed by George Pollock \u2013 (U.K./U.S.)"]}, {"page": "1961 in film", "response": ["* Murder, She Said, directed by George Pollock and starring Margaret Rutherford \u2013 (U.K.)"]}, {"page": "Kill or Cure (1962 film)", "response": ["Category:Films directed by George Pollock"]}, {"page": "Catherine Cookson", "response": ["It was followed by Rooney (1958), directed by George Pollock, based on her book Rooney.
