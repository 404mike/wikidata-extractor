Clare Martin did nearly manage to take the seat for the Labor Party upon the retirement of long-serving CLP member Nick Dondas in 1994, but lost out to the CLP's Peter Adamson, who held the seat for the next seven years. It was still widely presumed to be a safe Liberal seat in 2001, when it unexpectedly fell to Labor challenger Kon Vatskalis as part of Labor's sweep of the northern suburbs that year en route to winning government for the first time.  Vatskalis easily retained the seat in 2005, 2008, and 2012. He resigned on 18 September 2014, which triggered a by-election. It was won by Labor candidate Lauren Moss with a reduced margin. Moss picked up enough of a swing in 2016 to make Casuarina much more secure for Labor, and consolidated her hold on the seat in 2020; the CLP now needs a swing of 15.9 percent to win it.", "| Lauren Moss"]}, {"page": "Northern Territory Government", "response": ["| rowspan=4| Lauren Moss "]}, {"page": "Lauren", "response": ["* Lauren Moss (born 1987), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "List of Northern Territory by-elections", "response": ["|Lauren Moss"]}, {"page": "Indian Australians", "response": ["*Lauren Moss, ALP MP for Casuarina in the Northern Territory"]}, {"page": "List of foreign politicians of Indian origin", "response": ["* Lauren Moss \u2013 Northern Territory Labor MLA"]}, {"page": "2016 Northern Territory general election", "response": ["|  style=\"text-align:left; background:#ff6b6b;\"|Lauren Moss", "|Casuarina || Labor || |Lauren Moss || Giovanna Webb || || || ", "|  style=\"text-align:left; background:#ff8d8d;\"|Lauren Moss"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, 2012\u20132016", "response": ["|| Lauren Moss  || Labor || Casuarina || 2014\u2013present", ": On 18 September 2014, the Labor member for Casuarina, Kon Vatskalis, resigned.
