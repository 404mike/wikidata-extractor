After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle went on to become the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without silverware. In fact, having been Irish Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1\u20130 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern Irish football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2\u20131 in the 1975\u201376 Irish Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the Irish Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup's history, and not since 1955. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not long before he brought silverware to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976\u201377 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the Irish Cup final for the third consecutive season when they lost 4\u20131 against Coleraine. The 1977\u201378 season saw the club win an Irish League, Irish Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three Irish Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3\u20131 victory over Ballymena United secured the club's third trophy of the season.", "Below is a list of the managers Linfield have appointed during the club's history. In the early years after the club was formed in 1886, the team was selected by the club committee, a standard practice by football clubs at the time. Since then, 25 different men have held the position of Linfield first team coach/manager. However, only six have been appointed since Billy Campbell's departure in 1975. David Jeffrey holds the record for the longest reign as manager, having been in charge for 17 years and 16 weeks between 4 January 1997 and 26 April 2014. Jeffrey and Roy Coyle jointly hold the record for the most trophies won as manager, having led the club to 31 major honours each. Former Northern Ireland international Warren Feeney is the club's previous manager, having been appointed in May 2014. He resigned in October 2015 to become assistant manager of Newport County, with current manager David Healy appointed as his successor.", "|Billy Campbell"]}, {"page": "William Campbell", "response": ["* Billy Campbell (footballer, born 1920) (1920\u20131994), Scotland international footballer (Greenock Morton FC)", "* Billy Campbell (Northern Irish footballer) (born 1944), Northern Ireland international footballer (Sunderland AFC, Dundee FC, Motherwell FC)", "* Billy Campbell (baseball) (1873\u20131957), left-handed pitcher in MLB from 1905 to 1909", "* Billy Campbell (TV executive) (born 1959), American television executive producer", "* Billy Campbell (born 1959), American actor sometimes referred to as William Oliver Campbell or Bill Campbell"]}, {"page": "1967 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|RW ||||Billy Campbell"]}, {"page": "Billy Campbell (footballer, born 1944)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Campbell (Northern Irish footballer)"]}]}}
