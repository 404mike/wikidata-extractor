He subsequently signed for hometown club Hull Kingston Rovers, and began to make a positive impression in the Academy. His performances for Hull KR Academy led him to a Super League d\u00e9but in the last game of the 2007 season against the Huddersfield Giants.In 2008, I'Anson made eight appearances scoring two tries including one in the Hull Derby.  This form secured a contract for 2009 where he made 12 appearances in 2009's Super League XIV.I'Anson scored three times in seven appearances for Hull Kingston Rovers in 2010 before going on a month's loan to Cooperative Championship club Widnes Vikings following Scrum Half James Webster's retirement. However, he suffered a season-ending knee injury just twenty minutes into his Vikings d\u00e9but which required a knee reconstruction.Despite the injury lay off, the Widnes Vikings signed Chaz I'Anson on a 12-month contract for the 2011 season and handed him the number 7 jersey.  In April 2011, he was named vice captain as the Vikings began preparations following the successful Super League application.  I'Anson's return to fitness and form has led to the development of a promising half back partnership with the Wigan Warriors' dual registered Stand Off Joe Mellor.In 2012, I'Anson joined Championship Club Swinton Lions. In 2013 he started working at Wade Deacon High School.Chaz I'Anson - Widnes Vikings", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hull Kingston Rovers", "response": ["* Chaz I'Anson"]}, {"page": "Widnes Vikings", "response": ["||Chaz I'Anson"]}, {"page": "Chaz", "response": ["*Charles Chaz I'Anson (born 1986), English rugby league player"]}, {"page": "Tangi Ropati", "response": ["Ropati joined Widnes Vikings in the 2010 close season along with Chaz I'Anson, Steve Tyrer and Macgraff Leuluai as the Vikings prepared for Super League."]}, {"page": "2009 Hull Kingston Rovers season", "response": ["|Chaz I'Anson"]}, {"page": "2010 Widnes Vikings season", "response": ["| NRC Quarter Final || Barrow || 26-12 || Won || H || 1,718 || 3 June || Grady (4), Netherton (12,76), Gaskell (26,40), Kohe-Love (51) || Grady 1/3, Chris Gerrard 0/2, Thackeray 0/1 || N/A || James Ford, Dean Gaskell, Toa Kohe-Love, Mat Gardner, Paddy Flynn, Chaz I'Anson, Anthony Thackeray, Jim Gannon, Kirk Netherton, Ben Davies, Shane Grady, Dave Allen, Lee Doran || Chris Gerrard, Ben Kavanagh, Jordan James, Dave Houghton ||-", "|Chaz I'Anson || 30/11/86 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 "]}, {"page": "I'Anson", "response": ["*Chaz I'Anson (born 1986), English rugby league player"]}, {"page": "2012 Widnes Vikings season", "response": ["Widnes announce the signing of Castleford Tigers centre Willie Isa on a 2 Year Deal.
