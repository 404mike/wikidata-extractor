His writing and presenting credits include The Happiness Formula on BBC Two in 2006 and The Crime of Our Lives for BBC Radio 4 in 2007.

Biographer Thomas Forget added, \"Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.\" In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the \"most influential artist of all time\" in a poll by NME. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be \"the most important and influential artist since the Beatles\". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had \"one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century\" and \"he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with\". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for \"the creative powerhouse that Britain has become\" by challenging future generations \"to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks\". Easton concluded that Bowie had \"changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself\". In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's Culture Show. Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press wrote, \"Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie\".", "Buckley wrote that Bowie \"mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock\", and was probably \"never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual\", instead experimenting \"out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'.\" Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan\u2014with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969\u2014Bowie and his first wife Angie \"created their bisexual fantasy\". He wrote that Bowie \"made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke'\u00a0... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women.\" The BBC's Mark Easton wrote in 2016 that Britain was \"far more tolerant of difference\", and that gay rights (such as same-sex marriage) and gender equality would not have \"enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago\"."]}, {"page": "John Major", "response": ["Writing shortly after he left office, the historian and journalist Paul Johnson wrote that Major was \"a hopeless leader\" who \"should never have been Prime Minister\". The sentiments echoed that of much of the press at the time, which was generally hostile to Major, especially after Black Wednesday. The journalist Peter Oborne was one such figure, though writing in 2017 he stated that he now regrets his negative reporting, stating that he himself and the press in general were \"grossly unfair to Major\" and that this was motivated at least in part by snobbery at Major's humble upbringing. In 2012 Oborne had written that Major's government looks ever more successful as time goes by. Oborne singled out Major's achievements in the Northern Irish peace process, boosting the economy, keeping Britain out of the Eurozone, and his reforms of public services as being worthy of praise. Others remain unconvinced however and, writing in 2011, the BBC's Home editor Mark Easton judged that \"Majorism\" had made little lasting impact."]}, {"page": "Peter Symonds College", "response": ["* Mark Easton __ the Home Editor for BBC news broadcasting on national television and radio news since 2004, also a published author noted for his book titled Britain (2012)"]}, {"page": "Bearsden", "response": ["*Mark Easton, journalist"]}, {"page": "Murder of Kriss Donald", "response": ["The murder led some people to examine their views of racism and its victims.
