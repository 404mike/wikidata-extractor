In the 1910s, she was part of the circle of writers around the magazine Die Aktion, which championed literary Expressionism. In her poems, she examined the relationship between people and their bodies, especially the skin as both an interface between self and world and a limiting factor. In a late interview, she said that her work expressed a desire to transcend the limits of the body. Hardenberg was one of the few women among German Expressionist writers, and one recent reevaluation of her oeuvre ranks her work among the best of the Expressionists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Die Aktion", "response": ["*Henriette Hardenberg"]}, {"page": "List of pen names", "response": ["| Henriette Hardenberg || Margarete Rosenberg ||"]}, {"page": "Rosenberg (surname)", "response": ["*Margarete Rosenberg (1894\u20131993), German Expressionist poet better known under the pseudonym Henriette Hardenberg"]}, {"page": "Hardenberg (surname)", "response": ["* Henriette Hardenberg (1894\u20131993), German Expressionist poet"]}, {"page": "Richard Oehring", "response": ["Otto Hermann Richard Oehring was born in D\u00fcsseldorf.   His father was a senior official with the post office.   While he was growing up he attended schools successively in D\u00fcsseldorf, Hamburg and Berlin. He successfully completed his schooling in 1909 in Berlin.  By this time he was a member of the circle of youthful left wing intellectuals surrounding the poet Henriette Hardenberg and her brother Hans. A period of study in Munich followed and Richard Oehring, along with his brother Fritz joined the informal so-called \"Tat\" (\"Deed[s]\") group of left-leaning politically aware liberal writers and artists:  fellow members included Oskar Maria Graf, Franz Jung and Georg Schrimpf.   Following his return to Berlin, Richard Oehring took to contributing as a business and economics journalist to the \"Buchwald B\u00f6rsenberichte\" newspaper. From 1912 he was providing pieces for \"Die Aktion\", a newly launched magazine with its focus on literature and left-wing politics in which he also published some of his poetic and lyrical creations.   One of these was his essay \"Der K\u00e4fig\" which appeared in 1913/1914.   During 1913/1914 he actively promoted \"Die Aktion Authors' Evenings\" at the magazine, together with the likes of Gottfried Benn, Paul Boldt, Alfred Lichtenstein and Franz Pfemfert."]}, {"page": "Margarete Rosenberg", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henriette Hardenberg"]}]}}
