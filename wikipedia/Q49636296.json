It is the shaft of a stone high cross that was rediscovered hollowed out and in use as a quenching trough in a cutler's workshop in the Peak district of Sheffield. William Staniforth removed the cross and kept it in his garden, before it was later donated to the British Museum in 1924, where it is now kept.  The shaft is carved with a vine motif, a figure with a bow and arrow placed amidst the tendrils; similar figures are found on the Ruthwell Cross and an ivory in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and their significance has been much discussed.British Museum - Stone cross shaft  The head of the cross is missing.
