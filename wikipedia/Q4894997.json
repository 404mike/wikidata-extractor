This started a sequence of just four defeats in seventeen games, which included doing the double over Southampton (a 3\u20130 win at The Dell followed by a 4\u20130 win at Vale Park). This was achieved with Low's attacking policy, a stark contract to 'the Steele Curtain' defence. However their five clean sheets in their first eight games also illustrated their defensive strength. In September, right-half Selwyn Whalley turned part-time, dividing his duties between playing football and teaching at Hanley High School. Winger Alan Bennett was also transferred to Crewe Alexandra. By November, Vale were third in the league, and Low signed Bert Carberry and Jack Wilkinson. Following this top-scorer Stan Steele went off the boil, as the Vale lost their form in the Christmas period, losing 1\u20130 twice to Coventry City in two days.

Five players were released in the summer, most notably Bert Carberry (Exeter City) and Bill Cleary (King's Lynn). Low also sold Colin Askey to Walsall for 'a fairly substantial fee' and Basil Hayward to Portsmouth for 'a fair fee'.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Bert Carberry", "| July 1957 || MF ||  || Bert Carberry || Gillingham || Free transfer || ", "| August 1957 || MF ||  || Bert Carberry || Exeter City || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "Carberry (surname)", "response": ["*Bert Carberry (born 1931), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
