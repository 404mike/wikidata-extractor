The contributors included Charles Patrick Meehan, Julia Kavanagh, Denis Florence MacCarthy, John O'Donovan, William Carleton, Thomas D'Arcy McGee, and William John Fitzpatrick, and the articles were all signed. A second series began in 1862, renamed Duffy's Hibernian Sixpence Magazine, with Meehan as editor, which extended to six volumes and ended in June 1865. These and other relatively cheap magazines took advantage of the new-found confidence in home-grown literature and also offered an outlet for Irish authors."]}, {"page": "Thomas Street, Dublin", "response": ["*William John Fitzpatrick (31 August 1830 \u2013 24 December 1895) was an Irish historian born on Thomas Street."]}, {"page": "Fitzpatrick, William John", "response": ["#REDIRECT William John Fitzpatrick"]}, {"page": "Philip Tisdall", "response": ["He sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP  for Dublin University from 1739 to 1776 and then for the city of Armagh from 1776 to his death.
