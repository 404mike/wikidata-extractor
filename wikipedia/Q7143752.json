McGlynn usually played rhythm guitar in the band, occasionally switching to bass on stage in songs that featured Stuart Wood on keyboards.\nIn 1977, McGlynn released \"She'd Rather Be with Me\", which peaked at number 65 in Australia.McGlynn was gone from the band early the following year, and would subsequently enjoy some success in Japan and Germany as leader of his own band, Pat McGlynn's Scotties.  In 1993, his composition \"So Much of Your Love\" was sung by Sonia in the British heat of the Eurovision Song Contest.\nIn 2003, McGlynn accused former Bay City Rollers manager Tam Paton of trying to rape him in a hotel room in 1977.
