Originally a solo project of the Birmingham-born musician Tim Wright, Germ later developed into a collaboration with other musicians including trombonist Hilary Jeffrey, double-bassist Matt Miles, and producer John Dalby.

The engineer for that recording was electronic composer Tim Wright, who continues to collaborate with the band to this day.  That demo was circulated on cassette in November 1996.  The demo scored very highly (96/100) and led to the track Youth Awareness Week being included in a CD release, which in turn led to radio airtime on BBC Radio Scotland's Beat Patrol in 1998.", "West Yorkshire Super Heroes, released in June 1998, was again recorded in collaboration with Tim Wright.  Percy formed their own label, Tenfoot Records, to release the single, although it was distributed with assistance from Overground Records."]}]}}
