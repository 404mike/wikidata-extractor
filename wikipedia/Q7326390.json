During the night the attack was stopped by the CO Lt Col Sheil, and 'C' Company withdrew under heavy fire. 'A' Coy remained clinging to its position near the top. Lt Col Sheil visited Burns, who had observed that the Germans were least alert in the early afternoon. Sheil agreed with Burns suggestion that this would be the best time to attack the Germans. A second attack took place at about 15:30 on 8 October. 'C' Company led the advance with 'A' Company in close support. 'C' Company was held up by heavy machine-gun and mortar fire on the reverse slope of the preceding ridge and Sheil was ordered to get 'A' company through. Whilst Burns and 'C' Company's commander, Captain Peter Hassle, were assessing the situation from the exposed ridge top they were joined by Lt Col Sheil. A decision was made to have 'B' Company lead the attack and have 'A' company move through them onto the crest. A burst of Spandau fire opened up on the three officers and instantly killed Lt Col Sheil and wounded Captain Hassle in the arm. Burns then took command of both 'A' and 'C' Companies and after some hurried re-consolidation the attack continued. Burns personally led two platoons in an attack on two machine gun positions on the crest. Under intense fire they took control of the ridge, wiping out the machine-gun posts in the attack. The enemy counter-attacked twice through the night of 8\u20139 October, but were repulsed with heavy casualties and withdrew to pre-prepared positions further north. Following the capture of Monte Cece the award of a DSO was conferred on Captain Burns. Private Richard Henry Burton, a member of Burns' company, was awarded the Victoria Cross, for gallantry, in that same action."]}, {"page": "Burton (name)", "response": ["* Richard Henry Burton (1923\u20131993), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Alan Brebner", "response": ["By 1878, David and Thomas Stevenson were beginning to suffer bouts of ill health and were nearing retirement. Alan Brebner, along with David's son David Alan Stevenson therefore became full partners in the Stevenson engineering business, and were followed by David's second son Charles Stevenson in 1886. In the same year, Brebner was also elected a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers. The firm's expertise in lighthouse engineering had now begun to spread globally. They had already undertook work in India and, in 1868, had despatched Richard Henry Burton to Japan and now commissions were arriving from New Zealand and China. During this period, much of the engineering decisions were made by Brebner and with the deaths of David and Thomas, he became the senior partner: the business ceased to be monopolised by Stevensons. Brebner oversaw a sea-change in the Northern Lighthouse Board work, with elements increasingly subcontracted out to other firms. Furthermore, the work diversified from building and maintaining lighthouses to include foghorns, beacons and buoys."]}]}}
