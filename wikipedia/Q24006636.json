Initially scheduled for 13 January, it was played a week later following a COVID-19 outbreak in the Manchester City first-team squad after some players traveled to Dubai over the winter break. Melanie Leupolz had put Chelsea ahead just before half-time but City leveled shortly after the restart through Chloe Kelly. With five minutes to play, Lauren Hemp volleyed home to put City on the brink of the last four only for Chelsea substitute Niamh Charles to force extra-time with a looping 20-yard volley in the 90th-minute. It only took five minutes of extra-time for Chelsea to retake the lead as Guro Reiten swept home a rebound after Pernille Harder forced a save from Karen Bardsley, and Sophie Ingle added a second with a thunderous 25-yard into the top corner to make the closing minutes comfortable. In the semi-final, Chelsea faced West Ham United who sat 10th in the WSL and were three games into the management of Olli Harder. Pernille Harder opened the scoring four minutes in with Sophie Ingle netting another long range strike to double the lead. West Ham goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold gifted Harder a second and Bethany England added Chelsea's fourth shortly after as the Blues built what was an unassailable lead within the opening half hour. With Chelsea stepping off the gas, West Ham rallied in the second half with Adriana Leon and Mayumi Pacheco creating notable chances but it was Fran Kirby who found the scoresheet next with 20 minutes left. Harder eventually got her hat-trick in the 86th-minute as Chelsea ran out 6\u20130 winners, surpassing the previous biggest winning margin of four goals in a League Cup semi-final."]}]}}
