For his novels about English history and culture and his biographies of, among others, William Blake, Charles Dickens, T. S. Eliot, Charles Chaplin and Sir Thomas More, he won the Somerset Maugham Award and two Whitbread Awards. He is noted for the volume of work he has produced, the range of styles therein, his skill at assuming different voices, and the depth of his research.\nHe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1984 and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bildungsroman", "response": ["* English Music by Peter Ackroyd (1992)"]}, {"page": "City of London", "response": ["Alfred's taking of London and the rebuilding of the old Roman city was a turning point in history, not only as the permanent establishment of the City of London, but also as part of a unifying moment in early England, with Wessex becoming the dominant English kingdom and the repelling (to some degree) of the Viking occupation and raids. While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the Kingdom of England prevailed.London: The Biography, 2000, Peter Ackroyd, p.\u00a033\u201335"]}, {"page": "Heart of Darkness", "response": ["T.

Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century. Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. Also of significance is Letitia Elizabeth Landon's Calendar of the London Seasons (1834).

But secondly, it attached Eliot to the English community and English culture.\"", "This one, Murder in the Cathedral, concerning the death of the martyr, Thomas Becket, was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer Peter Ackroyd comments that \"for [Eliot], Murder in the Cathedral and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\" After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: The Family Reunion (1939), The Cocktail Party (1949), The Confidential Clerk, (1953) and The Elder Statesman (1958) (the latter three were produced by Henry Sherek and directed by E.

At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but Peter Ackroyd's biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.43, Blake, Peter Ackroyd, Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995. This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier stipple or mezzotint styles.Blake, William. The Poems of William Blake. 1893, p. xix. It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.", "Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate Jerusalem (1804\u201320), his most ambitious work. Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Blake approached the dealer Robert Cromek, with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's haberdashery shop at 27 Broad Street in Soho. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled The Canterbury Pilgrims), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his Descriptive Catalogue (1809), which contains what Anthony Blunt called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.Blunt, Anthony, The Art of William Blake, p 77 It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in The Examiner, was hostile.Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", The Times Saturday Review, 4 April 2009", "From a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. William Blake: The Critical Heritage. 1995, pp. 36\u20137. At the age of eight or ten in Peckham Rye, London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\" According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\".

Others consider his concepts and attitude more influential than his prose. Prominent admirers of Burroughs' work have included British critic and biographer Peter Ackroyd, the rock critic Lester Bangs, the philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the authors J. G. Ballard, Angela Carter, Jean Genet, William Gibson, Alan Moore, Kathy Acker and Ken Kesey. Burroughs had an influence on the German writer Carl Weissner, who in addition to being his German translator was a novelist in his own right and frequently wrote cut-up texts in a manner reminiscent of Burroughs."]}, {"page": "Arthur Machen", "response": ["Machen was also a pioneer in psychogeography, due to his interest in the interconnection between landscape and the mind. His strange wanderings in Wales and London recorded in his beautiful prose make him of great interest to writers on this subject, especially those focusing on London, such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd. Alan Moore wrote an exploration of Machen's mystical experiences in his work Snakes and Ladders. Aleister Crowley loved Machen's works, feeling they contained \"Magickal\" truth, and put them on the reading list for his students, though Machen, who never met him, detested Crowley. Other occultists, such as Kenneth Grant, also find Machen an inspiration. Far closer to Machen's personal mystical world view was his effect on his friend Evelyn Underhill, who reflected some of Machen's thinking in her highly influential book Mysticism."]}, {"page": "The Wind in the Willows", "response": ["Peter Ackroyd in his book, Thames: sacred river, asserts that \"Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] at Cookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood' . . . .\""]}, {"page": "Christopher Wren", "response": ["* The novel Hawksmoor by Peter Ackroyd, which features a fictionalised Christopher Wren"]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["* Peter Ackroyd", "|Peter Ackroyd || Chatterton || Hamish Hamilton"]}, {"page": "A Christmas Carol", "response": ["There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works.
