After playing as an amateur for Altofts Colliery he signed for the club in October 1943 and played his first game for the first team in the Wartime League (North) in the same month. His first game after the resumption of the Football League was in August 1946 and his last was in April 1956. Apart from one season (1952\u201353) Huddersfield were in the First Division of the Football League throughout this period.\nAfter being used in various positions in midfield and attack he settled into his most effective position, at centre forward. Although of relatively slight build compared to, say, Nat Lofthouse he was top scorer for the club on six occasions and joint top scorer in the First Division with 29 goals in 1953\u201354. He was an outstanding header of the ball and his most memorable achievement was heading four goals [1] in an 8\u20132 victory over Everton in April 1953, all four coming from crosses from the left wing by Vic Metcalfe.\nWith Lofthouse firmly ensconced as England centre forward and with competition from the likes of Jackie Milburn, Stan Mortensen and Ronnie Allen, it is perhaps not too surprising that his only representative honour was as reserve for a 'B' international against West Germany in March 1954. At this time Huddersfield were near the top of the First Division (something they have not repeated since). Coincidentally both Milburn and Mortensen had guested for Huddersfield during the war.\nGlazzard scored 142 goals in 299 league games for Huddersfield. A number of reports show Glazzard as scoring 141 League for Huddersfield Town; this is incorrect.\nOn 20 January 1951 there was a disputed goal against Arsenal, which was first awarded to Glazzard, then to Hepplewhite and later back to Glazzard.\nThe Huddersfield Examiner of 20 January 1951 stated:\n\"After 18 minutes Huddersfield took the lead. Platt the Arsenal goalkeeper could not keep hold of possession of a low ball which looked to have been deflected, and Glazzard forced it over the line.\"\nIn a later paragraph which was related to the second half, it read:\n\"It was difficult from the press box to determine the actual scorer of Town's goal, during the interval it was learned that Hepplewhite was credited with it, being the last player to play the ball before Platt's fumble.\"\nIn the 22 January 1951 edition of Hudderasfield Examiner it was reported:\n\"Huddersfield Town FC are crediting the first Town goal on Saturday to Jim Glazzard. At half time I learned that the Referee had credited the goal to Hepplewhite, but after the game he held an inquiry in the dressing room so he could complete his match report when he was informed by all the players who all thought Glazzard was the actual scorer.\"\nA book in celebration of the club's centenary by a team of people, including club historian Ian Thomas and his wife, have also credited the goal to Glazzard, hence him having 142 League goals, a Town League goals record that he holds jointly with George Brown.\nIn August 1956 he was transferred to Everton. Things did not work out there and he moved on to Mansfield Town after only three senior appearances. Ten goals and 22 appearances later, he retired in the summer of 1957 aged 34.\nIn later years he suffered from Alzheimer's disease and died in 1995, aged 72. A number of reports on his matches are to be found in the nostalgia section of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner website.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Doherty (footballer)", "response": ["After the conclusion of the war, he transferred to Derby County, with whom he won the FA Cup, scoring a goal in the final itself as Derby beat Charlton Athletic 4\u20131 at Wembley Stadium. In December 1946, Doherty moved to David Steele's Huddersfield Town for a fee of over \u00a39,000 after requesting a transfer. Doherty was unhappy with the directors who opposed his plan to secure his future by taking over the Arboretum Hotel and an earlier dispute over FA Cup Final tickets. The \"Terriers\" boasted a powerful front five of Albert Bateman, Jimmy Glazzard, Alf Whittingham, Doherty and Vic Metcalfe. However a weak defence saw them struggle in the lower reaches of the First Division throughout the 1946\u201347 season, 1947\u201348 and 1948\u201349 seasons. At Leeds Road he scored 33 goals in 83 league appearances, finishing as the \"Terriers\" top-scorer in his final two seasons under George Stephenson."]}, {"page": "Andy Booth", "response": ["The following week, in his final match for the Terriers, he scored his 150th goal for the club in the 1\u20131 draw against Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road his goal was final goal greeted with delirious celebration in the away fans section and Orient supporters applauding too. That puts him in 3rd place on the all-time list behind Jimmy Glazzard and George Brown. His 452 appearances put him in 4th place on the appearances list."]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 in English football", "response": ["*Jimmy Glazzard (Huddersfield Town) \u2013 29 goals"]}]}}
