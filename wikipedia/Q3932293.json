In the 1860s he was the dominant force in London's operatic scene. At the Academy of Music in New York, from 1879 to 1883 he presented opera in an unprecedentedly glamorous style.\nAfter his early successes Mapleson failed to keep pace with changing public tastes. His productions and repertoire were seen as old-fashioned and he was no longer able to engage the top operatic stars, who were to be seen at the Metropolitan Opera and Covent Garden.", "link_mentions": {}}}
