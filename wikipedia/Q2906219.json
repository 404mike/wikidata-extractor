He introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph, Atarashi Origami Geijutsu (New Origami Art) in 1954. He employed dotted and dashed lines to represent mountain and valley folds, and a few other symbols such as the \u201cinflate\u201d and \u201cround\u201d symbols. This system caught the attention of Samuel Randlett and Robert Harbin, who added a few symbols such as \u201crotate\u201d and \u201czoom in\u201d, and then adopted it as the standard. The Yoshizawa\u2013Randlett system was first described in Samuel Randlett's Art of Origami in 1961.

Almost any large, springy and flexible sheet of material can be used as an impromptu wobble board, although some materials are markedly better than others. Harris's instrument was originally made from a type of wood composite known as hardboard (Masonite in the United States and Australia). According to an interview he gave to Tony Barrell for The Sunday Times Magazine in 2001, Harris discovered the musical properties of hardboard by chance in 1959, when he was about to paint a portrait of the conjurer Robert Harbin. Before his subject arrived, Harris prepared the background, covering a large piece of hardboard with Prussian blue oil paint mixed with turpentine. But the surface refused to dry. \"It was all sticky and nasty. He was due to arrive in about half an hour.\" In desperation, Harris propped the board over a paraffin heater. When he touched it later, it was so hot it burned his finger. \"So I propped it between the palms of my hands and shook it to cool it down. And\u00a0... I thought, 'What a marvellous sound.'\""]}, {"page": "The Magic Circle (organisation)", "response": ["The Magic Circle's headquarters houses a theatre, library, museum, a dining room, a clubroom and bars.

The book was limited to 500 copies, and owners of the book were granted permission to build or have built the Zig Zag Girl (or indeed any other of the items in the book). The rights to the book and the Zig Zag illusion were then in time passed to The Magic Circle in the wake of Harbin's death.  The concept of dividing a lady assistant into two or three parts was something that Harbin experimented with throughout his career before creating his ultimate divide, the Zig Zag Girl.  Evidence of his fascination with this concept of dividing an assistant can be found in his earlier publications; the closest relative to the Zig Zag is the \"Little by Little\" illusion, which was also explained in The Magic of Robert Harbin."]}, {"page": "Alan Shaxon", "response": ["The Magic Circle gave Shaxon \"The Maskelyne\" award for services to British Magic.
