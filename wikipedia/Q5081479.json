Before the team left England, critics queried his appointment, arguing that a professional captain was unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton's authority was also compromised by the MCC, who did not give him the tour manager he requested;Gibson, pp. 185\u201386. instead, they appointed the inexperienced Charles Palmer, the Leicestershire captain, who had already been selected as a player on the tour.Swanton, p. 148. Palmer's dual role as player and manager blurred the lines of command.Howat, pp. 140\u201341. Hutton also found some of the professionals in the team to be difficult to lead, particularly Godfrey Evans,Gibson, p. 186. and Fred Trueman.Howat, p. 140. Off-field events often overshadowed the cricket. Amid growing independence movements in the region, Hutton believed his team was used as a political instrument to support colonial rule.Howat, pp. 125\u201326. The situation was further inflamed as journalists and English residents in the Caribbean placed great emphasis on an English victory, and the perception was that the series would establish the unofficial world champions. The standards of local umpiring were a further source of controversy. The crowds often made noisy protests about on-field events, often related to umpiring. The climax came in the third Test when missiles were thrown onto the outfield when the umpire judged Cliff McWatt was out; Hutton kept his team and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation.Gibson, p. 185.Howat, p. 131. The attitude of some English players inflamed feelings, either through a perceived lack of courtesy,Howat, pp. 129, 137\u201338. or their negative reactions to events on the field. Some critics held Hutton responsible for this,Howat, pp. 129\u201330, 140. but the editor of Wisden later wrote: \"[Hutton] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling\u2014an experience all of them wish to forget. A few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless.\""]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": [":1939: Charles Palmer"]}, {"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Leicestershire's first 70 years were largely spent in lower table mediocrity, with few notable exceptions.

Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with Peter Jackson who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player Roly Jenkins made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman Reg Perks took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper Hugo Yarnold who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, Eddie Cooper and, in his first full season, Don Kenyon all exceeded 1,000 runs.
