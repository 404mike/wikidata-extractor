While working in the department, he appointed a number of young scholars, many of whom went on to have influential careers as political scientists, including: Robert Benewick, Robert Berki, Howard Elcock, Dennis Kavanagh, Stephen Kirby, Michael Leifer, Jeremy Noakes, Bhikhu Parekh, and (Lord) Trevor Smith.Lord Trevor Smith pays tribute to Anthony H. Birch  While at Hull, Birch published what has become his most widely cited work, Representative and Responsible Government: An Essay on the Constitution (London: Allen and Unwin, 1964). This text examines the tensions between responsibility and representation in the Constitution in the British historical tradition and in 18th and 19th century political thought. 'The book is about governmental theory but its conceptual framework never gets between the reader and the examples. It could be given painlessly to relative beginners, but raises issues in a way which could spark off the more advanced student'.Geoffrey Marshall, Review of \"Representative and Responsible Government,\" Political Studies (1964), 12:  268-69.  In a review of this book, Geoffrey Marshall stated: \"Professor Birch's book is of a kind which is rare and extremely useful\". Bhikhu Parekh commented that it is: \"Pioneered a way of looking at democracy, combining both abstract theory and political rhetoric\".Bhikhu Parekh, \"Tribute on death of Anthony H.
