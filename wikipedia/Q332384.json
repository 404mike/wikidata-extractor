This perception appeared to be confirmed when Jock Stein, who had let Simpson go as Hibernian manager, was appointed Celtic manager later in the 1964\u201365 season; however, Simpson became the first choice after Fallon was blamed for a defeat by Rangers in the 1964 Scottish League Cup Final. His sense of humour made Simpson a popular figure in the team, who nicknamed him \"Faither\", on account of his relative old age. The highlight of his time at Celtic was winning the 1967 European Cup Final, as part of a clean sweep of trophies in the 1966\u201367 season. Apart from an early save with his knees from a Sandro Mazzola header, Simpson had little to do during the match.

The first game took place at Hampden Park, with Celtic winning 1\u20130 through a headed goal by Billy McNeill.  The match however was marred by incessant foul play and spitting by the Argentinians. The return match in Buenos Aires was a torrid affair; goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson was struck by a missile thrown by the Racing Club fans as the teams prepared for kick-off and had to be replaced by stand-in, John Fallon. A Tommy Gemmell penalty put Celtic ahead in the first half but Racing Club rallied and goals from Norberto Raffo and Juan Carlos C\u00e1rdenas either side of half-time clinched a 2\u20131 for the South American champions. The series of games then went to a decider, played in Montevideo, Uruguay. The game was a shambles, exacerbated by Racing Club's continual cynical fouling and spitting and the incompetence of the Paraguayan referee who was clearly out of his depth. Riot police had to intervene on the pitch several times as six players were sent off; four from Celtic and two from Racing Club. Bertie Auld was the fourth Celtic player to be sent off, but refused to leave the field, whilst Tommy Gemmell kicked a Racing Club player in the genitals in one of numerous incidents missed by the referee. Racing Club scored the only goal of the game in the second half, winning the game 1\u20130 and the Intercontinental Cup. Celtic were criticised for their conduct in Montevideo, but the provocation in all three games was extreme and Jock Stein commented afterwards \"I would not bring a team to South America again for all the money in the world.\""]}, {"page": "1967 European Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||12|| John Fallon"]}, {"page": "List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winning players", "response": ["|John Fallon||||Celtic|||1||1967 ||"]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|GK |||| John Fallon"]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|GK |||| John Fallon"]}, {"page": "Celtic F.C. in European football", "response": ["Celtic reached the European Cup final again in 1970.

John Fallon was outstanding in goal for Celtic and with the game nearing its end had limited the score to 2\u20130 for the Portuguese side. Diamantino, however, scored direct from a free-kick in the final minute to level the tie on aggregate and force extra-time. No further goals were scored in the additional 30 minutes, and the tie was decided by the toss of a coin. Captain Billy McNeill successfully called, and Celtic progressed to the quarter-finals. Celtic were unhappy that the tie had been decided in this manner, and suggested to UEFA an alternative of using a scoreline based on the number of corners forced in extra-time. UEFA rejected this proposal, but soon afterwards introduced penalty kick shoot-outs in the European Cup to decide drawn ties after extra-time.

Including David Hay, Lou Macari, George Connelly, Kenny Dalglish and later Danny McGrain and Paul Wilson, this group became increasingly regular over the next few seasons alongside the remaining 'Lions', and signings such as Tommy Callaghan, Harry Hood, Dixie Deans and latterly Andy Lynch, plus long term squad members like Pat McCluskey and Jim Brogan. After Ronnie Simpson and his deputy John Fallon left the club, Evan Williams, Ally Hunter and Denis Connaghan all had spells as goalkeeper. Aberdeen got within two points of Celtic in 1970\u201371, with Rangers 15 behind in fourth. Aberdeen had an opportunity to take the title when they and Celtic met at Pittodrie in April 1971 but Celtic came away with a 1\u20131 draw,Steve Murray: Aberdeen should have ended Celtic\u2019s first run to nine-in-a-row as we were \u201cbest team\u201d in 1970/71, Sean Wallace, Evening Express, 8 June 2020 and although they dropped another point in the next fixture (coinciding with Aberdeen's last), they had two postponed matches to play and won them both to retain the championship. In 1971\u201372 the gap was 10 points, again ahead of Aberdeen (Rangers 16 off Celtic's total), as the Hoops also reached another European Cup semi-final, losing to Inter on a penalty shootout. The early 1970s had been a turbulent period for Rangers, as they not only had to contend with a powerful Celtic but also with the traumatic events of another disaster at Ibrox in January 1971 when 66 supporters died in a crush on a stairway at the end of an Old Firm fixture. This led the club to overhaul the ground into an all-seater stadium over the next decade, overseen by manager Willie Waddell (a 1950s Rangers hero as a player and the boss who led Kilmarnock to the 1965 title), though the financial impact of this undertaking was not obviously felt in the short term. On the field, the struggle to overcome Celtic's domestic run was offset by a victory in the 1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, confirming that Scottish teams still maintained high standards comparable to others across the continent despite the domestic dominance of one team alone.The forgotten story of \u2026 Rangers\u2019 1972 European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup win, Daniel Harris, The Guardian, 4 September 2014"]}]}}
