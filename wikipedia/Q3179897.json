His name was registered as John Waters Hutchison, Waters being the maiden name of William's mother. He appears in the 1901 census as John Hutchison, golf caddie. He had an older brother who was also a golf player, Tom Hutchinson. Hutchison later moved to the United States and became a naturalized citizen in 1920. He was known there as Jack Falls Hutchison or John Falls Hutchison. He won two major championships, the PGA Championship in 1920 and the Open Championship at St Andrews in 1921. His 1921 victory was the first by a U.S.-based player; the following year Walter Hagen became the first U.S.-born winner.\nIn 1937, Hutchison won the inaugural PGA Seniors' Championship at Augusta National Golf Club, and in 1947 he won that event for a second time.\nBeginning in 1963, Hutchison was one of the two men who served as honorary starters for The Masters (along with 1908 U.S. Open champion Fred McLeod), until ailments prevented him from hitting one of the honorary tee shots in 1973. His death on September 27, 1977 came just two days before Masters co-founder Clifford Roberts' own death.\nHutchison died at the age of 93 in Evanston, Illinois.  He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ryder Cup", "response": ["The British team was: George Duncan (captain), James Braid, Arthur Havers, Abe Mitchell, James Ockenden, Ted Ray, James Sherlock, J.H.

Hutchison scored 74 and 64 and took the \u00a350 first prize. At St Andrews, Hutchison led the qualifying and then won the Open itself.

The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973 when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981 and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died."]}, {"page": "The Open Championship", "response": ["In 1921 eleven U.S.-based players travelled to Scotland financed by a popular subscription called the \"British Open Championship Fund\", after a campaign by the American magazine Golf Illustrated.
