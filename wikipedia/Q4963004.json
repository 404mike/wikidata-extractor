After 141 appearances he lost his first team place in 1996 and was loaned to Carlisle United. Later in the year he joined Darlington, where he remained until his retirement from professional football in 2002.\nHis 13-year playing career brought almost 400 league and cup appearances and 6 England caps at under-21 level. He made his debut coming on as a substitute for Mark Blake in a friendly against Wales on 5 December 1991 at Prenton Park. He was also part of the England under-21 team that won the 1991 Toulon Tournament, beating the hosts, France, 1\u20130 in the final.Atkinson had a brief spell working for Darlington's Centre of Excellence before spending five seasons as assistant manager of Northern League Division One club Newton Aycliffe. He was appointed assistant manager at Spennymoor Town in February 2012, and took up the corresponding role at Darlington 1883 (now Darlington) three months later. Atkinson stepped up to take charge of first team affairs on 1 October 2017 following the resignation of manager Martin Gray. This role was short-lived, and in November 2017, he re-joined Gray at York City as matchday analyst.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sean Gregan", "response": ["Gregan returned to Darlington on 4 June 2012 as a player-coach, as part of new manager Martin Gray's backroom staff. He was appointed as joint manager of Darlington, alongside Brian Atkinson, on 1 October 2017 for the rest of the 2017\u201318 season after Gray left for the club's National League North rivals York City. However, the two left the club four days later without having taken charge of a match. With Atkinson also being a director of the Martin Gray Football Academy (MGFA), Football Association rules meant he was unable to hold the Darlington managerial position as the academy's owner was in charge at another club. Gregan turned down the offer of a six-month contract to take over as manager on his own, as he would have had to relinquish his own role the MGFA."]}, {"page": "Spennymoor Town F.C.", "response": ["The 2009\u201310 season was a huge success, with the arrival of former Aston Villa player Bradley Groves as Club Chairman with former England, Newcastle and West Ham United Striker Paul Kitson as President. This led to Spennymoor being crowned Northern Football League Division One Champions with 100 points, at the time being only the third team to ever do so and a feat that was surpassed the season after by winning the league with 103 points. Despite winning the league in three consecutive seasons (2009\u201310, 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312), the club did not apply for promotion as they wanted to be financially stable before they took the next step up. Although an application for promotion was subsequently made after their runners-up position in 2012\u201313 to Darlington 1883 (again breaking the 100 point mark), the club was not deemed by the FA worthy enough of an offer of promotion. At the beginning of the season, then Assistant Manager Brian Atkinson joined Martin Gray at Darlington 1883 and Gavin Fell took the position of Assistant Manager. Gav helped Whitley Bay towards 3 consecutive FA Vase victories and also spent a year at Blyth Spartans before joining the Moors. Also in this season, Spennymoor reached the final of the FA Vase for the first time and beat Tunbridge Wells F.C. 2\u20131 in front of 16,000 people, followed by a victory parade around the town the following Monday. Along with the cup runs and the loss of winter games due to the bad weather, the season was eventually extended into the middle of May as the club played over 80 games if pre season friendlies are included."]}, {"page": "1992 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|RM ||11|| Brian Atkinson"]}, {"page": "Fremantle Team of Legends", "response": ["* Brian Atkinson \u2013 football historian"]}, {"page": "Riccardo Gabbiadini", "response": ["In the Northern section of Masters Football 2011 he represented Sunderland along with brother Marco however he failed to score and Sunderland failed to qualify from the group stages.
