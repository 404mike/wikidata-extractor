Skelton's studio in Streat has continued as an educational and artist's workshop since his death in 1999. Eric Gill and Jacob Epstein conceived a great scheme for doing some colossal figures together around 1910 for a modern Stonehenge on 6 acres of land at Asheham House, Beddingham, south-east of Lewes.

Along with his friend and collaborator Jacob Epstein, Gill planned the construction in the Sussex countryside of a colossal, hand-carved monument in imitation of the large-scale structures at Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh. Throughout the second half of 1910 Epstein and Gill would met on an almost daily basis. Earlier in the year they had held long discussions with Rothenstein and other artists, including Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy, about the formation of a quasi-religious brotherhood. At Ditchling, Epstein worked on elements of Oscar Wilde's tomb in Pere Lachaise cemetery for which Gill designed the inscription before sending Joseph Cribb to Paris to carve the lettering. Cribb had come to Ditchling with Gill in 1907. Other apprentices included David Jones, David Kindersley (who in turn became a successful sculptor and engraver) and his nephew, John Skelton, Laurie Cribb, Donald Potter and Walter Ritchie."]}, {"page": "Hanwell", "response": ["The wave pattern to the brass kicking plates on the doors represents the sea.
