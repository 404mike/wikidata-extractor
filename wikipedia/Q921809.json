Roots Manuva featured on the track \"All Things to All Men\", which later soundtracked the final scenes of 2006 movie Kidulthood. The Cinematic Orchestra's albums grew increasingly ambitious over the years, with 2007's Ma Fleur album marking a move away from beats, and embracing folk influences. The album was based on the work of photographer Maya Hayuk (who commissioned 11 pictures based on three short stories recounting the journey from birth to death), and conceived by Swinscoe as the premise for the score of an imaginary film.

At the same time, a new style of electronic music emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of UK garage and jungle, with influences from dancehall, drum and bass and hip hop; this new genre was dubbed \"grime\" (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle. In 2001, Roots Manuva claimed that British hip hop \"is more healthy\" than American hip-hop, and is more about making the music than is it about exploiting wealth or hitting it rich.Success followed The Streets' 2002 album Original Pirate Material, and he became one of the first of the new breed of British hip hop artists to gain respectable sales, though his verbal style resulted in him being shunned by many artists in the scene. Such success has caused a surge in media exposure of other British hip hop acts. Welsh rap group Goldie Lookin Chain also achieved chart success with their tongue-in-cheek take on hip-hop. Key records such as Skinnyman's Council Estate of Mind, and Klashnekoff's The Sagas Of... were released, cementing the reputations of the artists and opening up the floor for new artists to emerge. Labels Low Life Records, run by prominent political rapper Braintax, and Young N' Restless started and became the starting point for many. At the same time, just as garage was losing momentum, grime was creating interest. Wiley's Treddin' on Thin Ice was a cornerstone of the genre, and one-time friend Dizzee Rascal won a Mercury Music Prize for his debut Boy in da Corner. From then on, grime artists were the only MC's for interested record labels, and UK Hip-Hop's momentum dried up.A new generation of young socially conscious hip-hop musicians emerged as a counter to the grime scene that many in the UK Hip Hop scene perceived as commercial. These rappers strived to bring attention to both positivity and lyricism as well as the injustices of war, gentrification and racism, following in the tradition of conscious rappers such as Nas, Mos Def and Talib Kweli.

'Nuff said.\" Pitchfork contributor Tom Breihan commented how the record was similar to Radiohead's Kid A, noting how Manuva goes from \"street-rap relevance to navel-gazing experimentation\" through slow and methodical production and lyrical vocalisation, concluding that \"Manuva has the force, vision, and charisma to remain relevant, to keep ahead of the game. He's too good to let the world pass him by, but that's exactly what will happen if he continues to disappear inside himself.\" Jonah Weiner, writing for Blender, noted how the album goes back and forth from \"comically paranoid fantasies (\"Awfully Deep\", \"Too Cold\")\" to tracks with a \"political edge (\"Mind to Motion\", \"The Falling\")\", calling it \"protest music gone gleefully psycho.\" John Bush of AllMusic said, \"Overall, Roots Manuva may have a lot to say during the verses, but when his choruses consist of little more than a repeated line shouted over and over (\"Awfully Deep,\" \"Too Cold\"), listeners won't be hanging around long enough to decipher his verses.\"", "Category:Roots Manuva albums"]}, {"page": "Chali 2na", "response": ["He is a good friend of and frequent collaborator with British hip hop star Roots Manuva, having worked with him on a number of songs (including \"Revolution 5\", which appears on Fish Market and Dub Come Save Me, and \"Join The Dots\", which appears on Roots Manuva's second proper album, Run Come Save Me).
