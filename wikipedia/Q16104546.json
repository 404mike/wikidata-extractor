He served as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Londonderry (later East Londonderry) from February 1974 until 2001. He was one of the UUP members opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.\nFor some years he was a member of the Conservative Monday Club (which followed the Tory tradition of being Conservative and Unionist). In September 1982 he was chairman of the club's Northern Ireland Committee when it published a Policy Paper entitled  Proposals for a Constitutional Settlement [for Ulster].\nAs Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Parliamentary Party from 1987 to 1995, in an attempt to derail multi-party talks initiated by Peter Brooke (the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland), in February 1990 Ross unsuccessfully introduced a Private Member's Bill, the Northern Ireland Act 1974 (Amendment) Bill, to provide that laws for Northern Ireland may not be made by (non-amendable) Orders-in-Council but by (amendable)  Bill introduced into the United Kingdom Parliament, and repeatedly called on the then Conservative Government to implement its 1979 Conservative General Election Manifesto commitment to \"establish one or more elected regional councils with a wide range of powers over local services\" (in Northern Ireland), which had been drafted by the then UUP Leader Jim Molyneaux and adopted by the late Airey Neave (then Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland) in 1978.\nFollowing Jim (later Lord) Molyneaux's retirement as UUP Leader, Ross unsuccessfully stood for the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party in September 1995 and, although a close confidant and supporter of Molyneaux throughout the latter's leadership of the UUP, quickly became a very vocal opponent of the policies and style of newly elected UUP Leader David Trimble.\nIn June 2008, it was announced that he had been made the party president of Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV).William Ross stood for the TUV in the 2010 UK General Election in the East Londonderry Constituency.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Ross"]}, {"page": "William Ross", "response": ["William Ross may refer to:", "*William Ross, 8th Lord Ross (died 1640), Scottish nobleman", "*William Ross, 10th Lord Ross (died 1656), Scottish nobleman", "*William Ross, 12th Lord Ross (died 1738), Scottish nobleman, soldier and politician", "*William Ross, 14th Lord Ross (died 1754), Scottish nobleman", "*William Ross (speaker) (died 1830), New York politician, Speaker of the State Assembly 1814", "*William Ross (Canadian politician) (1824\u20131912), merchant, ship builder and politician in Nova Scotia, Canada", "*William Ross (Ontario politician) (1854\u20131937), merchant and politician in Ontario, Canada", "*William Ross, Baron Ross of Marnock (1911\u20131988), Secretary of State for Scotland in the 1960s", "*William Ross (Unionist politician) (born 1936), Ulster Unionist Party member of Parliament until 2001", "*William Ross (cricketer) (fl. 1860), Australian cricketer", "*William Ross (footballer, born 1874) (1874\u2013?), English professional footballer active in the 1890s", "*William Ross (baseball) (1893\u20131964), American Negro leagues baseball player", "*William Ross (rower) (1900\u2013?), Canadian Olympic rower", "*William Ross (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20131995), Scottish footballer", "*William Ross (water polo) (born 1928), US water polo player who competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics", "*William Ross (poet) (1762\u20131790/91), Scottish Gaelic poet ", "*William Ross (theatrical producer) (1915\u20131994), State Managers Association, Actors' Equity Association", "*William Ross (actor) (1923\u20132014), Tokyo-based American actor, voice actor, voice director and editor, and the founder of Frontier Enterprises", "*William Ross (composer) (born 1948), soundtrack composer", "*William Ross (Star Trek), a character in Star Trek"]}, {"page": "East Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The 2001 election was seen at a province-wide level as a battle over the Belfast Agreement with the DUP opposed to it and most of the UUP in favour; however, this situation was seemingly reversed in East Londonderry, where the sitting Ulster Unionist MP, William Ross, was completely opposed to all involvement with the Agreement and its institutions, whilst the DUP candidate, Gregory Campbell, was a minister in the executive set up by the agreement.
