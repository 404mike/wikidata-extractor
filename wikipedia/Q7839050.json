It saw John Simm reprise his role as the Harold Saxon version of the Master and introduced Milo Parker as a young incarnation of the Master. Beevers, Gatiss, Jacobi, Macqueen, Roberts, and Gomez all reprised their roles. Gina McKee makes a cameo appearance as the Lumiat and Jon Culshaw voices Kamelion impersonating the Ainley Master. In the story, the Saxon Master has killed the Doctor and taken control of the universe using an entropy wave that has destabilized his body and threatens to destroy the universe. He summons his previous selves in an attempt to steal their lives and heal himself. The intervention of Missy, the alternate-universe Master and Jo Grant thwarts Saxon's plans and, after discovering that the entropy wave is a sentient manifestation of the Master from the future \u2013 their final incarnation, a being of pure rage and insanity \u2013 the War Master kills his other incarnations (including himself) to cause a paradox and return the universe to normal.

The depiction of Daleks with coloured casings has also been used to indicate rank, although these differentiations do not constitute separate variants as such. Of particular note in this respect is John Peel's BBC Books Doctor Who novel War of the Daleks in which grey, blue, red, black and gold Daleks are described as having successively higher status, all serving under the Dalek Prime. Other examples are the TV21 Dalek comic strip in which a Black Dalek is shown acting as second-in-command to the Golden Emperor, and Trevor Baxendale's novel Prisoner of the Daleks where a Dalek Inquisitor General is described as being of the \"New Series\" design but having a casing of gunmetal black with gold slats and hemispheres."]}, {"page": "Tegan Jovanka", "response": ["*Fear of the Dark by Trevor Baxendale"]}, {"page": "Nyssa (Doctor Who)", "response": ["*Fear of the Dark by Trevor Baxendale"]}, {"page": "Ace (Doctor Who)", "response": ["*\"The Ghost's Story\", by Trevor Baxendale (Short Trips: Repercussions)"]}, {"page": "Mel Bush", "response": ["*\"Mortal Thoughts\" by Trevor Baxendale (Short Trips: Life Science)", "*\"Dr Cadabra\" by Trevor Baxendale (Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas)"]}, {"page": "Eighth Doctor Adventures", "response": ["|16 || The Janus Conjunction||Trevor Baxendale || rowspan=\"3\" | Sam || October 1998", "|33 || Coldheart||Trevor Baxendale || April 2000", "|45 || Eater of Wasps||Trevor Baxendale || May 2001", "|71 || The Deadstone Memorial||Trevor Baxendale || October 2004"]}, {"page": "Fifth Doctor", "response": ["*Fear of the Dark by Trevor Baxendale"]}, {"page": "Past Doctor Adventures", "response": ["|58 || Fear of the Dark || Trevor Baxendale || 5th || Tegan and Nyssa || December 2002"]}, {"page": "Sam Jones (Doctor Who)", "response": ["In The Janus Conjunction by Trevor Baxendale, Sam dies when she becomes poisoned by radiation on the planet Janus Prime.
