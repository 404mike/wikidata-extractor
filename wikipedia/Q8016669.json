In 1911, he moved to Derby, where he ran a market stall selling hosiery and drapery. Moving his stall from city to city, he was able to link SLP members across northern England and the Midlands, and surreptitiously distribute radical literature.\nPaul fully endorsed the SLP's opposition to World War I, and he supported Derby anti-war activist Alice Wheeldon. In 1917, he authored The State: its Origin and Functions, in which he developed the Marxist theory of the state. He became co-editor of the SLP's newspaper, The Socialist, and its national organiser. He stood for the party in the 1918 general election in Ince, taking 13% of the votes cast.\nWithin the SLP, he was a proponent of communist unity, and after this was rejected by the majority of the party, he became a founder member of the Communist Unity Group. This group joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) at its founding conference, where Paul put the case against affiliation to the Labour Party. Although the new party voted to affiliate, the Labour Party refused to accept this.\nIn 1921, Paul became the editor of the CPGB's publication Communist Review, and he stood for Parliament in Manchester Rusholme at the 1923 and 1924 general elections. His candidacies were supported by the local Labour Party.\nPaul then became the editor of the Sunday Worker, published by the National Left-Wing Movement. Removed from his posts during the period of Bolshevisation, he remained active in the local peace and Anglo-Soviet friendship movements.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Communist League (UK, 1919)", "response": ["Although Aldred had expressed in an October 1919 article that the revolutionary moment was \"drawing closer and closer together on a platform of practical revolutionary effort\", divisions still existed over the question of parliamentary elections. In an attempt to find a \"tactical compromise\" between the parliamentary position of electoral participation and the anti-parliamentary position of the election boycott, the Communist League decided to imitate Sinn F\u00e9in's abstentionist tactic of using elections as a platform for their propaganda, while pledging not to take their seats if elected. When a by-election was called in Paisley, the Communist League attempted to put this proposal into action, offering to support an SLP candidate that stood on an abstentionist platform. However, the local SLP leader William Paul ended up declining the offer to stand entirely and took on the hardline anti-parliamentary position. Declaring that \"every vote withheld is a vote for socialism\", Paul called for an election boycott that particularly targeted the Labour Co-op candidate John Biggar, resulting in the victory of the Liberal candidate and former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith."]}, {"page": "William Paul", "response": ["Bill, Billy, Willie, or William Paul may refer to:", "* William Paul (MP), British MP for Windsor, 1710\u20131711", "* William Paul (attorney) (1885\u20131977), Alaskan politician and attorney", "* William Paul (Australian politician) (1846\u20131947), New South Wales politician", "* William Paul (British politician) (1884\u20131958), also known as Bill, socialist politician", "* William Paul (New Zealand politician) (1875\u20131942), New Zealand politician", "* William Paul (footballer, born 1868) (1868\u20131932), Scottish footballer", "* William Paul (judoka), American who participated in Judo at the 1967 Pan American Games", "* William Paul (bishop) (1599\u20131665), Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Lichfield", "* William Paul (minister) (1754\u20131802), a minister of the Church of Scotland", "* William Paul (Utah architect) (1803\u20131889)", "* William Paul (horticulturalist) (1822\u20131905), British", "* William Paul (died 1773), older brother of John Paul Jones", "* William Paul (1754\u20131802), Chaplain in Ordinary in Scotland to King George III of the United Kingdom", "* William Paule (fl. 1388), English politician"]}, {"page": "William Paul (socialist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Paul (British politician)"]}, {"page": "Communist Party of Great Britain election results", "response": ["This list does not include William Paul, Morgan Philips Price, Shapurji Saklatvala, Joe Vaughan or Ellen Wilkinson, party members who stood for the Labour Party."]}, {"page": "Hands Off Russia", "response": ["The National Committee for the Hands off Russia Movement was elected at a conference in London in January 1919.
