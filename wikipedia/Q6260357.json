Four years later saw his marriage to Susanna, and the following year saw the beginnings of his work for the church. Taylor was first chosen to be a deacon, and went on to become treasurer of the church's benefactions.  Taylor also oversaw the funding of local schools and his business expertise led to an increase in their funds. In 1781 he was elected to the Board of Guardians, an organisation responsible for administering and distributing funds of parish workhouses, places where people who were unable to support themselves could go to live and work.  While on the board, Taylor set about training the paupers of Norwich to spin yarn, earning many thousand pounds for the parish. In 1784, having restored the family fortunes, he took an active part in the foundation of the Norwich Public Library.Roger Burt, John Taylor: mining entrepreneur and engineer, 10 He developed an interest in local politics, joining the Whig party as a radical reformer, emerging as their leader in Norwich. He made social contact with HRH Duke of Sussex, the duke of Albemarle, and John Coke, Squire of Holkham Hall, who was nationally known as an agriculturalist."]}, {"page": "John Taylor (Civil Engineer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Taylor (mining engineer) "]}, {"page": "John Taylor (mining engineer) (version 2)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Taylor (mining engineer)"]}, {"page": "List of Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia articles", "response": ["|Mining, history of || Technology || 24.8 || John Taylor"]}, {"page": "List of contributors to Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia", "response": ["|John Taylor (1779\u20131863) ||\t\tMining", "|Mining\t||\tJohn Taylor"]}, {"page": "Susannah Taylor", "response": ["In 1777 she married John Taylor who was a businessman and hymn writer.

The square chimney (renovated in 2016) and the circular chimney were both built in 1840. The agent's house, smithy, winding house (now demolished), circular gunpowder house and engine reservoir (to supply boiler and cooling water to the engines) were all constructed in the 1840s. In 1869 the Cornish engine house replaced an earlier engine house building and the winding engine was installed, with the winding drum that still remains. The main shaft was sunk in 1823 and is over 200m deep. The underground channel used to drain floodwater from the mines (the sough) was built from 1873 to 1881 and runs about  to its outlet into the River Wye to the north (carrying several million litres of water per day). The mine closed with financial troubles in 1883. It was operating for brief spells between 1913 and 1923 but was then only reopened again in 1950, before finally closing down in 1958. The existing steelwork frame of the headgear above the main shaft and the corrugated iron winding house are from the 1950s. The underground mine shafts are now all closed for safety."]}]}}
