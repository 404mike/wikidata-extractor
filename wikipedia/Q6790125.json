He went on to have short spells at three clubs in the lower leagues of the United States of America football pyramid during 2004, before returning to England with Aldershot Town. He then played for various non-league clubs in his local West Midlands region between 2005 and 2007 until League Two side Wycombe Wanderers signed him on a short-term contract in March 2007. He was released shortly afterwards, where he joined Conference National side Kidderminster Harriers. After a lean first season at the club, Barnes-Homer established himself as top scorer in the next campaign with 25 goals, averaging almost one goal for every two games.\nA similar goal return during 2009\u201310 prompted interest from former Football League club Luton Town, who signed him in January 2010. He finished the 2010\u201311 season as Luton's top scorer with 29 goals. He left Luton in early 2012, going on to spend four months at Swedish side \u00d6stersunds FK, before returning to the Conference with Macclesfield Town for the start of the 2012\u201313 season. In August 2013, he signed a two-year contract with Forest Green Rovers. On 10 January 2014, Barnes-Homer signed for Cambridge United on a free transfer until the end of the season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dudley", "response": ["* Matthew Barnes-Homer (born 1986 in Dudley) English professional footballer  SoccerBase Database retrieved December 2017 who mainly played for Kidderminster Harriers F.C., Luton Town F.C. and Macclesfield Town F.C."]}, {"page": "Kidderminster Harriers F.C.", "response": ["| Matthew Barnes-Homer"]}, {"page": "Syracuse Salty Dogs", "response": ["|Matthew Barnes-Homer"]}, {"page": "\u00d6stersunds FK", "response": ["* Matthew Barnes-Homer"]}, {"page": "England national football C team", "response": ["|Matthew Barnes-Homer", "|Chris Holroyd, Matthew Barnes-Homer"]}, {"page": "Daniel Parslow", "response": ["Parslow had been playing mostly at right-back in 2010\u201311 before losing his place to Liam Darville in January 2011, but retained his place in the team by playing at centre-back in York's 4\u20130 victory over league leaders AFC Wimbledon on 1 February 2011 with McGurk suspended.
