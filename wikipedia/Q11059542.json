He represented the Chamber of Commerce as an Unofficial member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1954 to 1955. In the Legislative Council, he strongly opposed the introduction of section 27 to the Inland Revenue Ordinance, which allowed the government (in case of doubt as to the provenance of a profit) to consider lack of overseas taxation as evidence that the profit in question arose in Hong Kong, thus becoming liable to taxation in Hong Kong. The section was repealed 27 years later as misconceived.Taxation without Representation page 140. . Michael Littlewood. Hong Kong University Press. 1 January 2010. Google Books. Alphabet.
