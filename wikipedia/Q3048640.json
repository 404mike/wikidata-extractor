From Winchester he went up to New College, Oxford. He played cricket for New College, but did not represent Oxford University Cricket Club in first-class cricket. He did however play one first-class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University in 1882, a year after his graduation from New College. He batted twice in the match, being dismissed for scores of 1 and 15 by Edward Peake and Charles Godfrey respectively. After graduating from Oxford, he worked for the family business, Weatherby & Sons, which was responsible for publishing the Racing Calendar.
