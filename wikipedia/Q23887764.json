Having been in charge for just over 9 months, Cook is the second shortest serving manager in the club's history. Cook argued that he deserved more time in an interview a month after his dismissal, stating \"If the new ownership had sat down and said to me at the start that if we didn\u2019t have instant success then [I would] be gone, then I wouldn\u2019t have stayed.
