Brown (1928\u20132008) was a noted British naval architect. Born in Leeds, he joined the Admiralty and became a member of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors. He rose through the ranks to become the Deputy Chief Naval Architect, before retiring in 1988.\nAfter retirement, he turned his attention to writing, publishing many books on the technical development of warships in the Royal Navy. He also authored the history of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors published during the centenary of that organisation in 1983.\nBrown died in Bath, Somerset, on 15 April 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Brown", "response": ["* David K.

Naval architect and historian David K. Brown wrote, \"What made [Warrior] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world.\" Faster, better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals, she was superior to any existing naval ship. The Admiralty stopped construction of all wooden ships of the line, and ordered another 11 ironclads over the next few years. Jacky Fisher, who was the ship's gunnery lieutenant in 1863\u20131864, later wrote that most people did not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about: \"It certainly was not appreciated that this, our first armourclad ship of war, would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something like a thousand years.\""]}, {"page": "Orion-class battleship", "response": ["One of the few things retained from earlier ships was the position of the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909\u20131910 Programme.Brooks 1995, pp. 42\u201344; Friedman 2015, p. 114 David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: \"It is amazing that it took so long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO)'s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships.\"Brown, pp. 41\u201342"]}, {"page": "HMS Rodney (29)", "response": ["The Nelson class was an innovative design, but limited by the constraints of the Washington Naval Treaty.  The decision to use 16-inch guns combined with the 35,000-ton displacement limit made saving weight the primary concern of designers.  The Director of Naval Construction, Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, informed the ship's designer, Edward Attwood, \"In order to keep the displacement to 35,000 tons, everything is to be cut down to a minimum.\" The emphasis on saving weight resulted in deficiencies which affected the performance of Rodney during the Second World War.  The design compromises had less negative consequences for Nelson because that ship underwent a number of refits immediately before and during the war.  Naval architect and historian David K. Brown stated, \"It seems likely that in the quest for weight saving, the structure was not quite strong enough.\"Brown, p. 182  Unlike Nelson, which exceeded the design specification for machinery weight, the lighter machinery of Rodney resulted in chronic problems.Raven & Roberts, p. 124 The ship's endurance declined substantially in the decade after her launch; in her 1941 action against Bismarck, Rodney was nearly forced to abandon the pursuit because of a lack of fuel.  British designers cited the poor endurance of the ship when establishing the endurance requirements for the battleship .Raven & Roberts, p. 334 Throughout the war Rodney was plagued with leaks as a result of panting, and the ship required repairs because of serious leaks in 1940, 1941 and 1944. During one storm, the leaking was severe enough to overwhelm a 50-ton pump. Leaks, defective riveting, and other problems continued to affect Rodney even after a 1941 refit in Boston, Massachusetts.Raven & Roberts, pp. 264\u2013267 By 1943 officials concluded that she required a complete modernization to extend her service life. The ship never received the necessary upgrades and as a result was unfit for service by the end of 1944.Raven & Roberts, p. 268"]}, {"page": "Castle-class patrol vessel", "response": ["The Castle class was designed by David K. Brown and was intended as a series of six offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy, designed in response to criticism of the previous  for insufficient speed, sub-optimal sea-keeping and lack of a flight deck for rescue helicopters."]}, {"page": "Colossus-class battleship (1910)", "response": ["All eight capital ships of the 1909\u20131910 Naval Programme had the same arrangement of masts and funnels; only the two battlecruisers had their foremast and forward funnel positions exchanged at considerable expense.Brooks 1995, pp. 44\u201346 David K.

The naval architect and historian David K. Brown commented, \"What made [Warrior] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world.\"Brown, p. 12 They were designed in response to Gloire, which started an invasion scare in Britain,Parkes, p. 6 but they had a very different concept of operation to the French ship which was meant as a replacement for wooden ships of the line. They were designed by Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates largely based on the fine lines of the large frigate . Warrior and her sister Black Prince were not intended to stand in the line of battle as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two and three-deck ships of the line. Rather they were designed to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought for their own advantage.Lambert, pp. 18, 20\u201321"]}]}}
