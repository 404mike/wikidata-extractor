It re-equipped with Avro Anson Mk. I twin-engine monoplanes from March 1939. The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 saw the squadron deployed on patrols and convoy escort operations off the coast of Essex and East Anglia, transferring to operations over the English Channel in January 1940. The Battle of France saw 500's aircraft being involved in increasingly heavy action, covering the evacuation of British and French troops from Dunkirk, and attacking German-held harbours. In the night of 30/31 May a 500 Squadron Anson crash-landed at the squadron's base at RAF Detling on returning from a raid on the Channel ports. The aircraft caught fire, and Corporal Daphne Pearson, a member of the WAAF was awarded the George Cross for rescuing the pilot from the burning aircraft before it exploded. On 1 June, three of the squadron's Ansons were patrolling off Dunkirk when they came under attack by as many as nine German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. The Ansons had been modified to improve their armament by adding two beam machine guns, and one of the Ansons claimed two Bf 109s shot down. While the squadron further modified the armament of some of its Ansons in August for use against German E-boats by adding a 20\u00a0mm cannon firing through the floor, it was increasingly deployed on convoy escort duties.", "* Daphne Pearson"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (D)", "response": ["# Daphne Pearson"]}, {"page": "Joan Daphne Mary Pearson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daphne Pearson"]}, {"page": "St Brandon's School", "response": ["* Daphne Pearson"]}, {"page": "Daphne (given name)", "response": ["*Daphne Pearson (1911\u20132000)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bournemouth", "response": ["* Daphne Pearson GC (1911\u20132000) one of only thirteen women recipients of the George Cross"]}]}}
