He grew up on the Six Acres Estate next to Andover Estate. Among his friends was fellow Leeds-born, London-raised Cornwall DJ Pat Mckay.\nHe formed the Mud Family with Mongo and Chester P, a group which released a number of EPs. These included such records as \"Itchy Town\" and \"Lash Suttin\", a reworking of Redman's \"Smash Something\". Later Supar Novar, Mr. Ti2bs, Uncle Festa and more joined the group. Skinnyman released a solo album, Council Estate of Mind in 2004.\nHe appeared in the first episode of Tower Block Dreams, a 2004 documentary series on BBC Three which looked into the underground music scene in council estates. He also played a small part in the 2005 interactive TV series Dubplate Drama.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of hip hop musicians", "response": ["* Skinnyman"]}, {"page": "List of one-word stage names", "response": ["* Skinnyman (born 1974), English rapper"]}, {"page": "British hip hop", "response": ["A new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including Jehst, Skinnyman, Nicky Spesh, Foreign Beggars and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of electronic music emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of UK garage and jungle, with influences from dancehall, drum and bass and hip hop; this new genre was dubbed \"grime\" (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle. In 2001, Roots Manuva claimed that British hip hop \"is more healthy\" than American hip-hop, and is more about making the music than is it about exploiting wealth or hitting it rich.Success followed The Streets' 2002 album Original Pirate Material, and he became one of the first of the new breed of British hip hop artists to gain respectable sales, though his verbal style resulted in him being shunned by many artists in the scene. Such success has caused a surge in media exposure of other British hip hop acts. Welsh rap group Goldie Lookin Chain also achieved chart success with their tongue-in-cheek take on hip-hop. Key records such as Skinnyman's Council Estate of Mind, and Klashnekoff's The Sagas Of... were released, cementing the reputations of the artists and opening up the floor for new artists to emerge. Labels Low Life Records, run by prominent political rapper Braintax, and Young N' Restless started and became the starting point for many. At the same time, just as garage was losing momentum, grime was creating interest. Wiley's Treddin' on Thin Ice was a cornerstone of the genre, and one-time friend Dizzee Rascal won a Mercury Music Prize for his debut Boy in da Corner. From then on, grime artists were the only MC's for interested record labels, and UK Hip-Hop's momentum dried up.A new generation of young socially conscious hip-hop musicians emerged as a counter to the grime scene that many in the UK Hip Hop scene perceived as commercial. These rappers strived to bring attention to both positivity and lyricism as well as the injustices of war, gentrification and racism, following in the tradition of conscious rappers such as Nas, Mos Def and Talib Kweli. Amongst this new generation included artists such as Klashnekoff, Akala, Lowkey and the Poisonous Poets.", "The early 2010s also saw the emergence of an underground UK hip hop scene emulating the earlier wave of 2000s rappers such as Jehst, Task Force, King Kashmere, MysDiggi and Skinnyman. With complex lyrics and rhyme schemes and '90s New York boom bap influenced production, High Focus Records was instrumental in bringing this sound to a wider audience. The label was founded in 2010 by London rapper Fliptrix and key members of the larger High Focus crew have included The Four Owls, Dirty Dike, Ocean Wisdom, Jam Baxter and Dabbla."]}, {"page": "MUD FAMILY", "response": ["#REDIRECT Skinnyman"]}, {"page": "Grime (music genre)", "response": ["Some DJ's, such as Lady Erica, were playing British grime by the mid-2000s in Australia but it was not common place. UK-born Fraksha is widely regarded as a pioneer of the scene in Australia. Fraksha originally started MC'ing in UK Hip-Hop crew Nine High alongside Scotty Hinds and Byron during the early 2000s. Nine High released two successful UK Hip-Hop mixtapes and performed alongside fellow UK Hip-Hop pioneers including Skinnyman and Klashnekoff. At the time, both Fraksha and Scotty Hinds were involved with the local London rave scenes and were exposed to grime, Jungle and Dubstep. In 2006, both Fraksha and Scotty Hinds would move to Australia and get involved with the local scene there. Fraksha and Scotty Hinds, alongside local MC's Diem and Murky, formed the first Australian based grime collective, Smash Brothers, in 2008. By 2010, the collective was booking grime shows and doing radio sets around Australia.

Skitz told Billboard magazine that the album reflected his rural upbringing and that it \"helps define the simplistic life most of us strive for\". Estelle, who was then unknown, featured in the album on the track \"Domestic Science\" along with two other female MCs, Wildflower and Tempa. Estelle approached Skitz to create the tune, thinking it would be successful due to the 1990 single, \"Ladies First\" by Queen Latifah and Monie Love and because nothing similar had been made in the UK since the Cookie Crew in the 1980s. Other artists on the album included Roots Manuva, Rodney P, Skinnyman, Phi-Life Cypher, Taskforce and MC Dynamite and the DJs Tony Vegas and Primecuts from the Scratch Perverts. The Independent said the album provided \"evidence of the rude health of the UK's hip-hop scene\". A BBC review said that Skitz \"delivered a consolidation of talent and attitudes of a musical movement that has been both struggling and hugely underrated for too long\" and that it was \"perhaps the best illustration of the state of home grown hip-hop today\". The beats on the album were described as \"a distinctive blend of breakbeat funk, jungle and reggae\". Dotmusic.com said that Taskforce's track \"The Junkyard\" did for Highbury Estate, what Mobb Deep and Nas did for Queensbridge. Roots Manuva's \"Inner City Folk\" was based around a chorus sung by Valerie Ettiene from the acid jazz group Galliano. In 2004, Stylus Magazine said that Phi-Life Cypher were \"the stand out guest act\" on the album.Phi-Life Cypher - Higher Forces - Review - Stylus Magazine "]}]}}
