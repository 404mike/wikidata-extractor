However, fearing the rise of inter-communal violence, the British Viceroy Lord Mountbatten advanced the date to 15 August 1947. This gave only 6 weeks to complete all the arrangements for partition. Mountbatten's original plan was to stay on the joint Governor General for both the dominions till June 1948. However, this was not accepted by the Pakistani leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In the event, Mountbatten stayed on as the Governor General of India, whereas Pakistan chose Jinnah as its Governor General. It was envisaged that the nationalisation of the armed forces could not be completed by 15 August. Hence British officers stayed on after the transfer of power. The service chiefs were appointed by the Dominion governments and were responsible to them. The overall administrative control, but not operational control, was vested with Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck, who was titled the 'Supreme Commander', answerable to a newly formed Joint Defence Council of the two dominions. India appointed General Rob Lockhart as its Army chief and Pakistan appointed General Frank Messervy."]}, {"page": "Charles Hudson (VC)", "response": ["The first few years of Hudson's service as a Regular Army officer were spent mainly on regimental duties, initially as adjutant to his regiment's 3rd (Militia) Battalion, holding this post from 11 March 1920 until 10 March 1923. He attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1926 to 1927, where his fellow students included Harold Alexander, William Holden, Douglas Wimberley, Rob Lockhart, Richard Lewis, Roy Bucher, George Clark, Richard Bond, Eric Harrison, Sidney Archibald, George Wood, Reginald Nolder, Euan Miller, Brian Robertson and Noel Holmes, all of whom were to become general officers in the upcoming war. His instructors included men such as Wilfrid Lindsell, Bernard Paget, Ronald Adam, Alan Brooke and Bernard Montgomery, Robert Gordon-Finlayson, Henry Pownall and Harold Franklyn.Hudson, pps. 153\u2212154 Hudson's time there was not particularly distinguished, and by the end of his first year he was almost dropped from the course, for being either consistently lazy or lacking in interest. Hudson was critical of, and often rebelled against, the methods his instructors used, believing them to not differ significantly from the methods used by the senior commanders in the Great War, which often failed with a heavy cost in human life. He furthermore believed that the Staff College's training was inadequate if the army was to fight another major European war.Hudson, p. 155 His attitude was described by his instructors as awkward and often inclined to be pig-headed. Nevertheless, Hudson, for the most part, enjoyed his time there and he was recommended for future employment.Hudson, p. 154"]}, {"page": "World Scout Indaba", "response": ["The 2nd World Scout Indaba was held in June, 1957 to mark the 50th jubilee year of Scouting and the centenary of the birth of Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell.
