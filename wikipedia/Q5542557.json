Leases changed hands several times before being granted to Arnold Lupton in 1910. Lupton then had to raise an estimated \u00a3450,000 to develop Harworth Colliery and made several promises to Viscount Galway that capital would be forthcoming and a prospectus to raise \u00a3500,000 in shares of \u00a31 was drawn up in 1912. The promised capital was not forthcoming and Lupton, facing a crisis, turned to Hugo Stinnes, a German industrialist. In 1913 Lupton leased the coal to Stinnes for \u00a32,000 and played a part in establishing the Anglo-German owned  Northern Union Mining Company to develop the colliery on the Serlby Estate. Development started and Germans who worked there were interned during the First World War. In 1922 Lupton had still not been paid and claimed the money from his pre-war deal in an arbitration court. Stinnes had refused to pay but the court ruled in Lupton's favour and he received his money, interest and costs. When Lupton's dealings with Germans were leaked after the horrors of the war, public opinion was not favourable."]}, {"page": "George Monckton-Arundell", "response": ["*George Monckton-Arundell, 7th Viscount Galway (1844 \u2013 1931), British Conservative politician and courtier"]}, {"page": "County War Memorial, Nottingham", "response": ["The war memorial was designed by Cecil Greenwood Hare and unveiled on 20 April 1922 by George Monckton-Arundell, 7th Viscount Galway, Chairman of Nottinghamshire County Council.
