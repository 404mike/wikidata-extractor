Her mother Jennie was the daughter of Harris and Betsy Noskovitch. Her father was Abraham Pulverness. Laslett often been claimed that she was of American Indian heritage but no evidence has ever been produced to confirm that.\nWith the name Frederica R.A.J.

Inspired by the American Free Universities and the Victorian Jewish Free School in Spitalfields, the group wanted to offer a wide range of classes including photography, music and mental health. Everyone involved had had some form of further education, but felt that it wasn't what it set out to be and wasn't very good. So they set out to create a school that did the opposite. They set up the first meeting on 8 March 1966 and 120 people turned up, 50 expressing an interest in lessons. Over the spring and summer months, classes began. They were not official classes, more just people sitting and talking and smoking. By the autumn, things picked up and there were too many people wanting to attend. Rhaune Laslett offered the free school the use of her house for classes. The Free School needed funding, so Jenner set up a Pink Floyd at All Saints Hall in September. It was not a big hall: it could not hold more than 300 people. This was when Pink Floyd started the course to fame. By Christmas, the events were getting centre-page spreads in the Melody Maker."]}, {"page": "John Hopkins (political activist)", "response": ["In 1966, with Rhaune Laslett and others, he helped set up the London Free School in Notting Hill.
