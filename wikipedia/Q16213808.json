He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler.\nHe was born at Perry Barr, Birmingham, and completed his education at Sandwell College.A real paceman, he made his first-class debut against a team of West Indians for Worcestershire in 1995, after breaking through with a quick wicket. Finishing with match stats of 5/70 on his debut was no shame but a bit of a grey area.\nHe played at county level for Shropshire from 1992 to 1998, while playing at club level for Shifnal.His second season was to prove harder than his debut, and he was released in 1997. Determined to stay in the game, he relegated himself to Second XI cricket with Derbyshire, and though he was only to make one first-class appearance for the Peakites, this was perhaps the appearance which epitomized his career, as he exemplified phenomenal pace and great comfort within the team.\nHe moved to Glamorgan very soon after, playing for them merely days after playing for Derbyshire, and later to Herefordshire, where Thomas's shining moment was to help Herefordshire progress in the C&G Trophy competition of 2001. He was later to appear for Herefordshire in the Minor Counties Championship, until 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Parvaz Mirza", "response": ["In 1995 Mirza was a fairly regular member of Worcestershire's one-day side, playing 15 times and taking 18 wickets in that form of the game at an average of 24.33; he was selected less often for in first-class matches, but still made six appearances. In the Championship match against Derbyshire in August he took his only five-wicket innings haul, returning figures of 5-110 in the first innings; he was also instrumental in saving the game for his county when he shared in an unlikely unbroken last-wicket partnership of 30 with Paul Thomas."]}, {"page": "Paul Thomas", "response": ["Paul Thomas may refer to:", "* Paul Thomas (academic) (born 1941), Australian university vice-chancellor", "* Paul Thomas (basketball) (born 1962), American basketball coach ", "* Paul Thomas (bassist) (born 1980), American bassist", "* Paul Thomas (cricketer) (born 1971), English cricketer", "* Paul Thomas (figure skater), British figure skater", "* Paul Thomas (footballer) (born 1982), Australian rules footballer", "* Paul Thomas (director) (born 1947), American pornographic actor and director", "* Paul Thomas (writer) (born 1951), New Zealand writer", "* Paul Thomas (priest) (born 1955), British Anglican priest", "* Paul Thomas (politician), member of the North Dakota House of Representatives"]}, {"page": "List of Shropshire County Cricket Club List A players", "response": ["*Paul Thomas (cricketer)"]}]}}
