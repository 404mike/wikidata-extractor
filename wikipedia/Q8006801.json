At Congleton he saw much of Joseph Priestley, then at Nantwich, who thought of him as a good classical scholar and entertaining companion. From 1757 he associated also with John Taylor, who in that year became divinity tutor at Warrington Academy; and in 1761 he preached Taylor's funeral sermon at Chowbent, Lancashire. An appendix to the printed sermon takes Taylor's side in disputes about the Academy, against John Seddon, and shows, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, that Harwood was by this time at one with Taylor's semi-Arian theology; although he says that he never adopted the tenets of Arius. His letter of 30 December 1784 to William Christie shows, for Gordon, that in later life he inclined to Socinianism."]}, {"page": "Thomas Christie", "response": ["Christie was born to Alexander Christie (brother of the Unitarian writer William Christie), a merchant in Montrose, Scotland in 1761. Christie attended a local grammar school and subsequently became a clerk in a bank. Deciding that he was more interested in literature and science, Christie studied medicine independently and then matriculated at the Westminster General Dispensary in London in 1784. At the same time, he began writing a series of articles on natural history for the Gentleman's Magazine and became friends with its editor, John Nichols. Although he attended the University of Edinburgh in 1785 and 1786 to earn his medical degree, he left the program to dedicate himself to a life of letters."]}, {"page": "Thomas Fyshe Palmer", "response": ["Palmer then read in Joseph Priestley's works, and became a Unitarian. For the next ten years Palmer preached Unitarianism to congregations in Dundee and other Scottish towns. A Unitarian society had been founded by William Christie, a merchant, at Montrose, and Palmer offered his services as a preacher (14 July 1783). In November 1783 Palmer reached Montrose, and remained as Christie's colleague till May 1785. He then moved to Dundee to become pastor of a new Unitarian society there, and he founded a Unitarian church. He preached also in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Arbroath, and Forfar, and formed further Unitarian societies. In 1789 he took temporary charge of the society at Newcastle. In 1792 his sermons in Edinburgh attracted attention, and pamphlets were published in refutation of his doctrines."]}, {"page": "Caleb Rotheram", "response": ["His second son was in the army. His third son, Caleb (1738\u20131796), educated at Kendal (the academy ceased in 1753) and Daventry Academy, was ordained minister of Kendal on 21 April 1756; he was a friend and correspondent of Joseph Priestley, and was apparently the first unitarian minister who officiated (1781) in Scotland.See William Christie (Unitarian).  His grandson, Edward Rotheram, was a senior officer of the British Royal Navy."]}]}}
