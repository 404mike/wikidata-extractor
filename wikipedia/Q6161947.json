It currently holds one Michelin star, which it gained within a year of opening. Elements in the restaurant such as the dessert bar have been subsequently included in Atherton's other restaurants.", "Chef Jason Atherton had previously worked for Gordon Ramsay for ten years before opening his first restaurant, Table No. 1 in Shanghai. In 2011, he opened his first UK based restaurant, Pollen Street Social, which became his flagship location. The name came from the location of the restaurant, and Atherton described the \"social\" name saying, \"I spend quite a lot of time in New York, and places like Stanton Social are popping up; and it's based around people being able to use a fine-dining restaurant for anything they want, not just for the food, but for the atmosphere, for the Champagne, for the private areas, for the bar. So it's a social place.\" It was funded by twenty years of Atherton's savings, as well as several minor investors in addition to a single private investor who owns 25%. He was relieved that there was a reasonable gap after the opening of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, due to the buzz caused by Blumenthal's restaurant. The restaurant is located at 8-10 Pollen Street, London, where previously a Pitcher & Piano public house was located. Prior to opening the restaurant, he opened a pop-up restaurant for two days in October 2010 to preview the menu to be served at Pollen Street Social.", "John Walsh, writing for The Independent described a mackerel dish as being inspired by the Danish restaurant Noma and praised the inventiveness of the dessert bar. He praised the staff, and summed up the restaurant saying \" There's a great deal to enjoy at Pollen Street Social. Jason Atherton has put his heart and soul and his considerable imagination into it, and it shows.\" The Daily Telegraph's Zoe Williams thought the interior looked \"like a posh All Bar One\", and while she praised the starters, she was underwhelmed by the main courses. She gave it a rating of six out of ten. Zoe Strimpel, in her review for City A.M. said that she would return to the restaurant \"in a heartbeat\". She singled out a smoked foie gras starter for praise, saying that it equalled the meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. She also praised a pork belly main course which was served with seeds, beetroot and chips."]}]}}
