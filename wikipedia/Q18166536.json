The first Bank at Swan River was started through MacDermott's suggestion and exertions, backed up by colonists of influence and means, and he was appointed Manager. Five years afterwards the Bank of Australasia proposed to amalgamate with the local institution, and this being agreed, sent a Manager from London, who died before the Bank was opened, and MacDermott was made Manager of the new Bank. Five years later the Australasian Bank resolved to close their branch at Perth, Western Australia and offered MacDermott the Managership of that at Adelaide, which he accepted. On leaving Swan River he received a flattering address, signed by all the members of the Executive Council, the Magistrates, clergy, and many others. Just before leaving England for Western Australia he married, and all his children were born in that colony. In Adelaide, under his management, the Australasian Bank secured a large share of the business.
