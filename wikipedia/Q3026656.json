The Sunderland Echo reported that some of the other candidates dropped out of consideration because of their interpretations of the laws of the game, a topic in which Edgar had excelled. He combined his new role with playing North-Eastern League football for Workington; he helped that club win the North-Eastern League Cup in 1937. Although the Courier reported in the 1937 close season that Edgar \"would not be averse to a return\" to Scottish football, he and former Darlington teammate Jerry Best were at Hexham, also of the North-Eastern League, in 1938."]}, {"page": "Bob Thompson (footballer, born February 1890)", "response": ["Thompson made his first appearance on 4 October 1913 in a 2\u20130 win at home to Middlesbrough and was almost ever-present for the rest of the season. Having finished 15th in 1913\u201314, Everton won the 1914\u201315 Football League title as well as reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup. Thompson played in 33 of the 38 league matches and all 5 cup-ties. He acted as club captain during the First World War, giving way to Tom Fleetwood when competitive football resumed. Injury interfered with Thompson's later career at Everton: he made 17 appearances in the first post-war season but rarely played in 1920\u201321, new signing Jock McDonald being preferred to partner Dickie Downs at full back, and was listed for transfer."]}]}}
