They combine elements of diverse musical genres and compositional techniques, often alien to the composers' own culture, into a unified and coherent body of works. Composers have often started their musical career in one discipline and have later migrated to or embraced others, while retaining important elements from the former discipline. In some cases, a composer now labelled \"classical\" may have started out in another discipline. For example, a specific label for John Zorn's music is difficult to choose: he started out as a performance artist and moved through various genres including jazz, hardcore punk, film music, and classical, and often embraces Jewish musical elements. All of these diverse styles appear in his works. Julian Anderson combines elements from many different musical genres and practices in his works. Elements of modernism, spectral music and electronic music are combined with elements of the folk music of Eastern Europe and the resulting works are often influenced by the modality of Indian ragas. His large-scale Book of Hours for 20 players and live electronics premiered in 2005. Tansy Davies's music also fuses elements of pop and classical music. Prince and Iannis Xenakis are both major influences. Kati Ag\u00f3cs' work for chorus and orchestra The Debrecen Passion (2015) surrounds settings of poetry by Szil\u00e1rd Borb\u00e9ly with mystical texts of Medieval Latin, Hungarian, and Georgian origin, as well as a Kabalistic prayer."]}, {"page": "Emily Hall", "response": ["Emily Hall (born 1978) is a composer of classical music, electronica and songs.
