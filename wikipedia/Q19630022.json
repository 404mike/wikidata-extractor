I was editing Am\u00e9lia Perchard, an article about a J\u00e8rriais writer. One of the sources is in J\u00e8rriais but while it is listed in the template docs as supported by MediaWiki, the hyphenated  is cut, and it results in an error as  isn't a language. (The same thing happens with Guern\u00e9siais, which is .) Is it possible this could be fixed (by not cutting the hyphenated section in these cases or something like that)? Thanks in advance!
