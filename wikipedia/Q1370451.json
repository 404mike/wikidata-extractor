With second choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton also being ruled out through injury, Konstantopoulos was handed his debut on 22 February against Wolverhampton Wanderers, a match which ended in a 2\u20132 draw after Konstantopoulos scored an own goal after dropping a cross from Wolves midfielder Kyel Reid into his own net. Konstantopoulos remained in goal for the following games, but made another error in a 2\u20130 defeat to Norwich City, when he failed to clear a long pass and was tackled by Dave Mooney to concede the first goal of the game. After Konstantopoulos suffered a foot injury in March, Cardiff manager Dave Jones signed Stuart Taylor on loan from Aston Villa; although Konstantopoulos remained with Cardiff for the rest of the season, he did not play again for the club, and he returned to Coventry at the end of the season having made a total of six appearances."]}, {"page": "John McGreal", "response": ["Needing to find a new goalscorer for the 2017\u201318 season, McGreal signed Mikael Mandron from Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee. He also brought in goalkeeper Rene Gilmartin and midfielder Ryan Jackson. He made a series of loan signings to bolster the squad, which included the arrivals of Ryan Inniss, Brandon Comley, Kyel Reid and Brandon Hanlan. Colchester got off to a poor start, but improved and collected ten points from five games to earn McGreal another Manager of the Month nomination in October. The young side's good form continued into December, where they picked up 11 points from a possible 15 to earn him yet another Manager of the Month nomination. However they struggled in the second half of the campaign, despite holding on to top-scorer Sammie Szmodics in the January transfer window, and ended the season in 13th-place. McGreal released four senior players and seven from the U-23 team. Sam Walker and Sean Murray also departed after failing to agree new deals."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Kyel Reid||||2011\u20132014, 2015\u20132016||131||12||"]}, {"page": "2008 MLS All-Star Game", "response": ["|MF ||28|| Kyel Reid || || "]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["||MF||28||||data-sort-value=\"Reid, Kyel\"|Kyel Reid||0||0||1||1"]}, {"page": "Kyle Reid", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kyel Reid"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|20||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kyel Reid", "| 27 November 2008 || W ||  || Kyel Reid || West Ham United || 30 December 2008 || "]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|MF|| Kyel Reid ||  Sheffield United || Free || 1 July 2009 ||"]}, {"page": "Marvin Sordell", "response": ["He made his debut on 6 August as the season began with a 1\u20130 loss at Swindon Town, in which he was substituted at half time for Kyel Reid.
