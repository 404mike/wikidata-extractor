His work has an underlying preoccupation with political issues, although this serious engagement is often expressed comically in the form of satire. For example, What a Carve Up! (1994) reworks the plot of an old 1960s spoof horror film of the same name.  It is set within the \"carve up\" of the UK's resources that was carried out by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative governments of the 1980s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 19", "response": ["*1961 \u2013 Jonathan Coe, English author and academic"]}, {"page": "Fnord", "response": ["To \"see the fnords\" means to be unaffected by the supposed hypnotic power of the word or, more loosely, of other fighting words.

Where it falls down is in denying its reader any real focus of human attention or involvement\". He added that, \"To dismiss the book as being too clever (or merely clever, for that matter) would be ungenerous as well as facile. Barnes is clearly serious about his themes, and there's more than a nod towards emotional commitment. One of his central concerns is the nature of history, and naturally enough - as a good, free-thinking, commonsense, late-20th-century liberal - he rejects any theory of history as pattern or continuum: 'It's more like a multi-media collage,' he explains, and this, of course, is the rationale behind the novel's own structural disjointedness\". Coe judged that the book failed to explore history's relationship with the exercise of power \"via the interaction of character. And this is where Barnes disappoints: I can't remember reading a novel which showed so little interest in the politics of everyday relationships - or one, at any rate, which isolated them so ruthlessly from the speculative realm of 'ideas'\". Coe found the \"Parenthesis, or half-chapter\" to be \"both too florid and too cool at the same time\", but concluded that, overall, \"Readers of this novel will feel awed, I'm sure, by the range of its concerns, the thoroughness of its research, and the agility with which it covers its ground. But when there are such big themes at stake, the reader can get tired of being teased, however ever waggishly.

Finding a permanent drummer proved difficult; Bill Bruford played with the group for a few months and was eventually replaced by Pip Pyle, thereby reuniting three of the former Hatfield musicians.
