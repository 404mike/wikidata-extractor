His style reflects his self-professed fondness of \"deadpan comedy, flat dialogue, things happening offstage and impressive characters\". Others note that his work \"combines pathos with the farcical\" and exhibits \"a casual reduction of visual keys into a more rudimentary drawing style\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Scientist", "response": ["In the 21st century, until May 2019, New Scientist contained the following sections: Leader, News (Upfront), Technology, Opinion (interviews, point-of-view articles and letters), Features (including cover article), CultureLab (book and event reviews), Feedback (humour), The Last Word (questions and answers) and Jobs & Careers.
