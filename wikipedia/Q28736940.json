A union of Saint Christopher and Nevis had been proposed as early as 1867, when Captain James George Mackenzie was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Christopher with a mandate to seek an amalgamation of the administrations of the two islands. This proposal met with strong opposition, however, and was withdrawn the following year. In 1871, Saint Christopher and Nevis became presidencies within the Federal Colony of the Leeward Islands, with Anguilla being attached to Saint Christopher as a dependency in the same year. However, in 1882, the legislature of the Leeward Islands passed legislation merging the two presidencies, forming a combined Presidency of Saint Christopher and Nevis.Phillips, p. 129"]}, {"page": "James Mackenzie", "response": ["*James George Mackenzie, Royal Navy officer and governor of the Falkland Islands"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors and administrators of Saint Christopher", "response": ["*James George Mackenzie, 1867\u20131869"]}, {"page": "List of governors of the Falkland Islands", "response": ["| 1862 || 1866 || Capt.
