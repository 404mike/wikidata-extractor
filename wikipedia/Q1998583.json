His surviving works include a setting of verses from Lamentations, and instrumental music for viols.\nThomas Morley, in his A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597) extols him as one of the greatest English composers, equal to Orlando di Lasso. He notes White's bold harmonies, and includes him in a list of seven eminent Tudor composers that includes \"Fayrfax, Taverner, Sheppard, Whyte, Parsons and Mr Byrd.\" Some MS partbooks now at Christ Church, Oxford dated about 1581 contain the tribute \"Maxima musarum nostrarum gloria White' Tu peris, actemum sed tua musa manet\" (\"Thou, O White, greatest glory of our muses, dost perish, but thy muse endureth for ever\").", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Byrd", "response": ["Some sets of keyboard variations, such as The Hunt's Up and the imperfectly preserved set on Gypsies\u2019 Round also seem to be early works. As we have seen, Byrd had begun setting Latin liturgical texts as a teenager, and he seems to have continued to do so at Lincoln. Two exceptional large-scale psalm motets, Ad Dominum cum tribularer (a8) and Domine quis habitabit (a9), are Byrd's contribution to a paraliturgical form  cultivated by Robert White and Robert Parsons. De lamentatione, another early work, is a contribution to the Elizabethan practice of setting groups of verses from the Lamentations of Jeremiah, following the format of the Tenebrae lessons sung in the Catholic rite during the last three days of Holy Week. Other contributors in this form include Tallis, White, Parsons and the elder Ferrabosco. It is likely that this practice was an expression of Elizabethan Catholic nostalgia, as a number of the texts suggest."]}, {"page": "Thomas Tallis", "response": ["He avoided the religious controversies that raged around him throughout his service to successive monarchs, though he remained, in the words of the historian Peter Ackroyd, an \"unreformed Roman Catholic\". Tallis was capable of switching the style of his compositions to suit each monarch's different demands. He stood out among other important composers of the time, including Christopher Tye and Robert White. The author and composer Ernest Walker wrote that \"he had more versatility of style\" than Tye and White, and \"his general handling of his material was more consistently easy and certain.\" Tallis taught the composer William Byrd and Elway Bevin, an organist of Bristol Cathedral and Gentleman of the Chapel Royal."]}, {"page": "Robert White", "response": ["Robert White may refer to:", "* Robert White (composer) (1538\u20131574), English composer", "* Robert White (guitarist) (1936\u20131994), American Motown session guitarist", "* Robert White (sculptor) (1921\u20132002), American sculptor", "* Robert White (tenor) (born 1936), American tenor of Irish descent", "* Robert White Johnson, American songwriter", "* Robert White (ambassador) (1926\u20132015), U.S. ambassador", "* Robert White (attorney general) (1833\u20131915), West Virginia Attorney General", "* Robert White (judge) (1759\u20131831), American military officer, lawyer, politician, and judge", "* Robert White (Washington, D.C. politician) (born 1982), District of Columbia council member", "* Robert White (West Virginia state senator) (1876\u20131935), American lawyer and politician", "* Robert White (Australian politician) (1838\u20131900), New South Wales politician", "* Robert White, American founder of the Duck Club political organization in 1980", "* Robert White (Virginia physician) (1688\u20131752), Scottish-American physician and surgeon", "* Robert White (American football) (1912\u20131969), American college football coach", "* Robert White (Australian footballer) (1895\u20131982), Australian rules footballer", "* Robert White (baseball), American baseball player", "* Robert White (cricketer) (born 1979), English cricketer and umpire", "* Robert White (handballer) (born 1983), British handball player", "* Robert White (sailor) (born 1956), British Olympic sailor", "* Robert White (engraver) (1645\u20131703), English draughtsman and portrait engraver", "* Robert White (bishop) (died 1761), Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, 1747\u20131761", "* Robert White (British Army officer) (1827\u20131902), British general"]}, {"page": "Chester Cathedral", "response": ["The earliest recorded appointment of an organist is of John Brycheley in 1541.
