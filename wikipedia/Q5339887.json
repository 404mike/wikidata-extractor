It does not dulicate them. Some of these MPs were not Irish nationals quite a few not nationalist activists. Examples, Edmund Vesey Knox, Charles Ramsay Devlin, Arthur John Moore, Sir Walter Nugent, 4th Baronet, Alfred Webb, Patrick O'Hare, Kevin Izod O'Doherty, Michael Henry  amongst others. Then there were as well other nationalist activists who were not MPs, such as Andrew Kettle or James Daly, who would otherwise lack a category. A compromise might be to move the categ to 'Irish Nationalist activists' if this is clearer ?
