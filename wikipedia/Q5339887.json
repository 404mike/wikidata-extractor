Initially a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he sided with the Anti-Parnellite majority when the party split in 1891.\nHe was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for West Cavan at an unopposed by-election on 26 March 1890, following the death of the nationalist MP Joseph Biggar, taking his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nHe was re-elected as an Anti-Parnellite at the 1892 general election, with a majority of more than three-to-one over his sole opponent, a Unionist.  At the 1895 election he was again returned unopposed in West Cavan, but also stood in Londonderry City, winning that seat by a slender majority over his unionist opponent.  He chose to sit for Londonderry City, and held that seat until he resigned from Parliament on 9 December 1898 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead.", "link_mentions": {}}}
