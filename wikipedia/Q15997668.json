He had a sister called Polly who corresponded with Lewis Carroll in the 1890s. He adopted the stage name of Aubrey early in his acting career.Information is scant on Mallalieu's pre-film career, but he is believed to have had a lengthy stage career before making the move into films. Archive sources available in New Zealand indicate that he spent a considerable number of years touring with stage companies in that country and Australia in the 1900s and 1910s.In December 1912 Mallalieu was touring Australia with Leal Douglas in a piece called \u201cFeed the Brute\u201d. The two formed a company and took it on a tour of South Africa, and then in May 1913 they travelled together to England on the SS Ballarat, when The Era reported that Mallalieu was returning after an absence of five years.Mallalieu may also have played supporting roles during the silent film era in Britain, but no named credits have been located as it was rare for supporting players to be name-checked at this period.\nMallalieu's first named film credit dates from 1934, and thereafter he accumulated 115 screen appearances before his death in 1948. These were overwhelmingly minor roles, many in quota quickies and B films, although Mallalieu also played in a considerable number of  prestigious and well-known productions such as The Stars Look Down (1940), The Young Mr. Pitt (1942), For You Alone (1945), The Wicked Lady (1945), Frieda (1947) and The Winslow Boy (1948).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Goose Steps Out", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Rector"]}, {"page": "\"Pimpernel\" Smith", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Dean"]}, {"page": "Champagne Charlie (1944 film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Butler"]}, {"page": "The Black Sheep of Whitehall", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Ticket Collector"]}, {"page": "Keep Fit", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Magistrate"]}, {"page": "Back-Room Boy", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu (uncredited) - West "]}, {"page": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1936 film)", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Trader Paterson"]}, {"page": "The Demi-Paradise", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Toomes"]}, {"page": "Hatter's Castle (film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Clergyman "]}, {"page": "A Place of One's Own", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Canon Mowbray"]}, {"page": "Mallalieu", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu (1873\u20131948) English actor"]}, {"page": "The Stars Look Down (film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Hudspeth"]}, {"page": "We'll Meet Again (1943 film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Stage Door Keeper"]}, {"page": "I Live in Grosvenor Square", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Bates  "]}, {"page": "Saraband for Dead Lovers", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Envoy at Ahlden "]}, {"page": "Yellow Canary (film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Reynolds"]}, {"page": "The Dark Tower (1943 film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Doctor"]}, {"page": "The Door with Seven Locks (1940 film)", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Lord Charles Francis Selford"]}, {"page": "The Queen of Spades (1949 film)", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Fedya"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1937", "response": ["| East of Ludgate Hill || Manning Haynes || Hal Gordon, Aubrey Mallalieu || Drama ||"]}, {"page": "29 Acacia Avenue", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Martin"]}, {"page": "School for Secrets", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as 1st Club Member"]}, {"page": "Master of Bankdam", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Doctor Bouviere"]}, {"page": "Busman's Honeymoon (film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Reverend Simon Goodacre"]}, {"page": "Pearls Bring Tears", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu as Mr. Vane"]}, {"page": "Paid in Error", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as George"]}, {"page": "They Flew Alone", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Bill, the Barber"]}, {"page": "The Black Tulip (1937 film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu \u2013 Colonel Marnix"]}, {"page": "Bond Street (film)", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Parkins"]}, {"page": "The Briggs Family", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Milward"]}, {"page": "Prison Breaker", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Sir Douglas Mergin  "]}, {"page": "Penn of Pennsylvania", "response": ["* Aubrey Mallalieu as Chaplain"]}, {"page": "The Face at the Window (1939 film)", "response": ["*Aubrey Mallalieu \u2013 M. de Brisson"]}, {"page": "Breach of Promise (1942 film)", "response": ["*  Aubrey Mallalieu \u2013 Judge"]}, {"page": "His Lordship Regrets", "response": ["His Lordship Regrets is a 1938 British comedy film directed by Maclean Rogers and starring Claude Hulbert, Winifred Shotter, Gina Malo and Aubrey Mallalieu.
