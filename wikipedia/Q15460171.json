A specially recorded interview with Alex about his work as an agony uncle between 2004 and 2016 was available to listen to through wireless headphones. This was exhibited alongside headphones that played a similar interview with his father Phillip Hodson about his agony uncle career in the 1970s. Both Alex and Phillip also had a selection of letters from their problem pages on display showing the differences but also similarities between the respective eras from which they came. Local MP David Lammy gave a speech at the opening evening of the exhibition and it was featured in a write up in The Guardian."]}, {"page": "ClearStory", "response": ["In 2013, ClearStory produced Sex Box, a one-hour formatted studio show broadcast on Channel 4 as part of its Real Sex season.
