Finucane came to prominence due to his successful challenge of the British government in several important human rights cases during the 1980s. He was killed by loyalist paramilitaries from the Ulster Defence Association, acting in collusion with British security services. In 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron met with Pat Finucane's family and admitted the collusion, although no member of the British security services has yet been prosecuted.Finucane's killing was one of the most controversial during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. He was shot fourteen times as he sat eating a meal at his Belfast home with his three children and his wife, who was also wounded during the attack. In September 2004, Ken Barrett an Ulster Defence Association member who was recruited as an informer by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch after confessing the shooting, pleaded guilty to his murder.After significant international pressure, the British government eventually announced a public inquiry. This was one result of the agreement made between the British and Irish governments at Weston Park in 2001. The British government said it would comply with the terms agreed by the two governments at Weston Park. They agreed to appoint an international judge that would review Finucane's case and if evidence of collusion was found, a public inquiry would be recommended. The British government reneged on this promise to Finucane's family after the international judge found evidence of collusion. Finucane's wife Geraldine declared in court papers that UK Prime Minister David Cameron stated, at a meeting with Finucane's family in London, that: \"It is true that the previous administration could not deliver a public inquiry and neither can we. There are people in buildings all around here who won't let it happen.\"Two public investigations concluded that elements of the British security forces colluded in Finucane's murder and there have been high-profile calls for a public inquiry. However, in October 2011, it was announced that a planned public inquiry would be replaced by a less wide-ranging review. This review, led by Desmond Lorenz de Silva, released a report in December 2012 acknowledging that the case entailed \"a wilful and abject failure by successive Governments\". Finucane's family called the De Silva report a \"sham\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Troubles", "response": ["There were many incidents of collusion between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries.
