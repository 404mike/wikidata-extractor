He appeared in 35 first-class matches as a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium pace. He scored 994 runs with a highest score of 79 and held 17 catches. He took 127 wickets with a best analysis of six for 50. He played a few games of county cricket for Lancashire from 1948 to 1950, but most of his first-class cricket was for Combined Services, which he represented in 20 matches from 1947 to 1962.\nHe served as an officer with the Northumberland Fusiliers in the Second World War, receiving the Military Cross for gallantry in Italy in 1944; he again served in the front line in the Korean War. His cricket was affected by the limited time he could spare from his army duties and by the shrapnel that remained in his arms and legs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sid Barnes with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["The following match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were almost a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. For players on both sides, it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught John Deighton and Jack Robertson and took 0/15 from four overs. During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at short leg, with one foot on the edge of the cut strip. According to retired Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, himself a former fielder in the leg trap, \"[Barnes\u2019s position] was the closest I have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side\". Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman Len Hutton was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to hook Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck bowling aimed at his upper body. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence.Perry (2008), pp. 68\u201369. Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, as though he were about to place it down on the batting surface, which was against the laws of cricket. Umpire Frank Chester, who was also known for his flamboyance and penchant for making himself visible, at one point held up proceedings momentarily when Barnes feigned to put his foot on the surface as the bowler was preparing to deliver the ball.Perry (2008), pp. 74\u201375."]}, {"page": "Geoff Ward (cricketer)", "response": ["Ward made two first-class appearances for Kent against Lancashire and Sussex in the 1949 County Championship, scoring 19 runs at an average of 9.50, with a high score of 6 not out, while behind the stumps he took 2 catches and made a single stumping.  These were his only first-class appearances for Kent, in 1950 he moved to Essex, where he represented the county in a single first-class match against the Combined Services.  In this match, he scored 2 runs in Essex's first-innings before being dismissed by John Deighton, while in their second-innings he made the same score before being dismissed by Brian Close."]}, {"page": "Dennis Shaw (cricketer)", "response": ["Shaw made a single first-class appearance for Warwickshire against the Combined Services in 1949 at Edgbaston.  Warwickshire won the toss and elected to bat, making 368/9 declared in their first-innings, with Shaw making 17 runs before he was dismissed by Robert Wilson.  The Combined Services responded in their first-innings with 284 all out, with Shaw taking the wickets of Bill Greensmith and John Deighton to finish the innings with figures of 2/60 from 20 overs.  In their second-innings, Shaw wasn't required to bat, with Warwickshire declaring their innings on 216/5.  The Combined Services narrowly avoided defeat, reaching 192/9 in their second-innings, before the match was declared a draw.  Shaw bowled 14 wicketless overs for the cost of 46 runs in the innings.  This was his only major appearance for Warwickshire."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* John Deighton (1948\u20131954) : J. H. G.
