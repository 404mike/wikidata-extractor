He was in the side which won the 1898\u201399 Scottish Division Two title and the following season earned selection to the Scottish League representative side. He joined Kettering Town in 1901 then moved to Bristol Rovers the next season.\nHowie was signed by Newcastle United in May 1903 and between then and 1910 made 237 appearances for the club, scoring 83 goals. He won the Football League Championship three times (1904\u201305, 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309) and was also an FA Cup winner in 1910. During this period he earned three caps for the Scottish national side, making his debut in 1905.Howie was universally known in the game as \"Gentleman James\" but was equally notable for his peculiar running action, which looked like a hopping motion. After leaving Newcastle in December 1910 he spent three seasons with Huddersfield Town before retiring.\nIn 1913 Howie moved into management when appointed manager of Queens Park Rangers, a position he held for seven years. He was then secretary-manager of Middlesbrough from March 1920 until May 1924. His brother David, also a former professional footballer, was concurrently manager of Bradford Park Avenue.\nIt is believed that after football Howie became a tobacconist in London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
