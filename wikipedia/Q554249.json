Born in Dublin when Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom, Johnson identified himself as an \"Englishman\" rather than an \"Irishman\" according to at least one report, though \"English\" at the time was often used interchangeably to denote \"British citizen\".In his playing days he was a center forward for Real Madrid and their first coach between 1910 until 1920. He also played as a Goalkeeper at the beginning of his career, the most important match was in the 1903 Copa del Rey Final.\nHe died of pneumonia aged just 50, on May 23, 1929.", "link_mentions": []}}
