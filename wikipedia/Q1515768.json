She met considerable resistance due to the prevailing belief that such matters should not be discussed by respectable people, especially women. She also became active in organizing workers associations for German women, and was linked to the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Her activities and political views caused her to be exiled by the German authorities. She moved to England in 1886, where she became involved in Socialist organizations, but fell out with Friedrich Engels. After leaving the English Socialist League she became involved in theosophy. Refusal to accept medical treatment may have contributed to her early death of untreated breast cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Schack", "response": ["*Gertrude Guillaume-Schack, born Gertrud Gr\u00e4fin Schack von Wittenau (1845\u20131903), a German women's rights activist"]}, {"page": "Women's Franchise League", "response": ["The Women's Franchise League was a British organisation created by the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst together with her husband Richard and others in 1889, fourteen years before the creation of the Women's Social and Political Union in 1903.Burton, S: \"Relatively Famous: Richard Pankhurst, The Red Doctor\", BBC History Magazine, February 2007, 8:2, page 22.

However, the conservative Protestants had difficulty with the dominant liberal view that an individual had the right to do whatever they wanted with their body as long as they did not harm or affect the rights of others. The liberals thought the state should defend the rights of citizens but should not impose any particular religious or moral values, while the conservatives thought \"the state is the guardian of God's commandments.\" Conservatives were also unable to accept the outspoken role that women played in the IAF, feeling it was for men to take the initiative."]}, {"page": "Gertrud Guillaume-Schack", "response": ["#redirect Gertrude Guillaume-Schack"]}, {"page": "Katharina Scheven", "response": ["Katharina Scheven was one of the young and liberal women who heard Gertrude Guillaume-Schack speak in London and took up the cause of abolishing regulated prostitution in Germany."]}]}}
