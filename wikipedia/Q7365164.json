A prolific writer, his other books included three on popular music between 1837 and 1929, several on the history of sexuality and many on antiques. He held other jobs as a shoe shop assistant, cinema manager and store detective. His book The Table Rappers (1972) was an exposure of fraud mediums, tricksters and charlatans in Spiritualism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederic W. H.

Science historian Sherrie Lynne Lyons wrote that the glowing or light-emitting hands in his s\u00e9ances could easily be explained by the rubbing of oil of phosphorus on his hands. It has been suggested that the \"spirit hands\" in the s\u00e9ances of Home were made of gloves stuffed with a substance. Robert Browning believed they were attached to Home's feet.Ronald Pearsall. (1972). The Table-Rappers. Book Club Associates. pp. 95-96. \"Home's spirit hands seemed to be long kid gloves stuffed with some substance, and Browning thought that they were fixed to Home's feet. This was a device of some mediums, and in the dim light of the s\u00e9ance actual feet could simulate spirit hands, especially those of children or not quite materialised hands. Even when adjacent sitters were keeping their feet on the medium's shoes this could be accomplished by the use of metal toe-caps on the medium's boots. The foot could also double for a spirit baby. This could be strapped to the medium's belt until needed, or to the leg a few inches above the ankle. When the s\u00e9ance lights 'accidentally' went out, the medium could thrust a stocking foot into the dummy hand, and by resting the foot on the other knee, the spirit hand or spirit baby could peep over the table in an astounding manner.\" Home was a sculptor and his studio in Rome contained sculpted hands. Lyons has speculated that he may have substituted the sculptor hands, leaving his real hands free to perform phenomena in the s\u00e9ance room.", "Researcher Ronald Pearsall in his book The Table-Rappers (1972) suggested that a loop of catgut was attached to the accordion so Home could turn it round.Ronald Pearsall. (1972). The Table-Rappers. Book Club Associates. p. 88 \"The two most prominent instruments at s\u00e9ances were probably the guitar and the accordion. The latter was one of Home's favorite props: his special instrument was ornately-decorated, with a very short keyboard. Its shape was dumpy and squat more like a concertina than an accordion. Except when it was playing by itself away from everyone, he held it beneath a table, his hands away from the keys. Stage conjurors, the most damaging witnesses against s\u00e9ance tricks, explained how it could be done. The accordion was on a loop of catgut, by which means Home could turn the accordion round. There was also on the market a self-playing accordion.\" Paul Kurtz wrote that other mediums had used a loop of catgut to obtain a similar effect with the accordion.Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. p. 189.  \"Various contrivances have been used by other mediums to achieve a similar effect. A concealed loop of catgut is attached to a hook, which then is used to pull the lower end of the accordion and produce notes. If the s\u00e9ance room is very dark, the medium, can, by means of a rubber tube, blow air into the accordion. His lungs take the place of the bellows, and air produces some notes.\""]}, {"page": "Mediumship", "response": ["Ronald Pearsall in his book Table-rappers: The Victorians and the Occult (1972) documented how every Victorian medium investigated had been exposed as using trickery, in the book he revealed how mediums would even use acrobatic techniques during s\u00e9ances to convince audiences of spirit presences.Ronald Pearsall.
