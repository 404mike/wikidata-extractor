Upon sentencing, Zod and his co-conspirators are infused within a gelatinous substance, encased in a crystalline material and are subsequently loaded into a Kryptonian ship. The ship then launches into orbit around Krypton where three smaller vessels establish a window into the Phantom Zone into which the ship enters. A short time later, the destruction of Krypton triggers the release of the prisoners. As in the comics, Phantom Zone is not immune from some powerful forces (explosions, blows, and so on) that will break Phantom Zone and free the criminals who deserve their punishment. Later in the film, the vessels Zod and his army are using possess a \"Phantom Drive\", a collision from a smaller ship (piloted by Col. Hardy of the U.S. military with Kal-El's rocket and operated by Professor Emil Hamilton and Lois Lane) with a similar drive causes a cataclysmic reaction that creates a small singularity, returning the ship and its occupants to the Phantom Zone along with the Military plane, Hardy, and Hamilton."]}, {"page": "Stargate Infinity", "response": ["* Pahk'kal (voiced by Mackenzie Gray) \u2013 A Tlak'kahn warrior and subordinate to Da'Kyll."]}, {"page": "Richard Russell Jr.", "response": ["* In episode 5 of the 2011 television miniseries The Kennedys, Russell was played by Mackenzie Gray."]}, {"page": "Alienators: Evolution Continues", "response": ["* Mackenzie Gray -"]}, {"page": "Cyborg (DC Comics)", "response": ["* Cyborg appeared in the 15th episode of Smallvilles fifth season, which was also titled \"Cyborg\". In this version, Victor (Lee Thompson Young), is a former Metropolis High School football star. He is involved in a car accident that kills him, supposedly, and the rest of his family. However, he is secretly rebuilt by Cyntechnics scientists including Dr. Alistair Krieg (Mackenzie Gray), who experimented on a group of test subjects. Victor was the only test subject to survive the experiments. Cyntechnics was bought up by LuthorCorp shortly before Victor's escape. Lex denies any knowledge of Cyntechnics' secretive activities. Although Victor's cybernetic enhancements are entirely endoskeletal instead of exoskeletal as they are in the comics and other media, a shot of Clark Kent's X-ray vision reveals that Victor's cranial armor covers the same-shaped area as it does in the comics. He also bleeds a dark fluid as he does in the comics. Smallville never uses the name \"Cyborg\" in his first appearance. Instead, Victor refers to his enhancements as \"bionic\", and the episode explicitly references the 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man which also featured a cybernetically-enhanced \"bionic\" man. Lee Thompson Young reprised his role in \"Justice\", a Season 6 episode about Green Arrow gathering together a group of individuals to combat Lex Luthor and his experiments. In this episode, Victor has finally taken the name \"Cyborg\", as Green Arrow's team uses code names. Also on the team are Aquaman and Impulse. While Victor was last seen with a girlfriend named Katherine, he explains that his mechanical parts put a strain on the relationship. After their eventual breakup, Victor states that it was Green Arrow who kept him from committing suicide. The episode also shows Cyborg wearing something of a costume (a stylized silver vest), and utilizing further enhancements Green Arrow gave him. One of his new functions allows him to hack into and disable security systems. While connecting to machines, Cyborg's left eye glows red, another nod to his comic book incarnation. Cyborg gets mentioned by codename in the season 9 episode \"Checkmate\" by Amanda Waller, demanding to know the names and faces of everyone who ever worked for Watchtower (aka Clark and Chloe). Young again reprised his role as Victor Stone in the season 9 finale titled \"Salvation\". He reported into Watchtower of the battle against the Kandorians. Cyborg is the main character in the online animated Smallville spin-off Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom along with the other Justice Leaguers. In episode three, he displays additional abilities such as offensive sound wave projection."]}, {"page": "Ben Hur (2003 film)", "response": ["* Rabbi \u2013 Mackenzie Gray", "* Priest \u2013 Mackenzie Gray", "* Soldier #1 \u2013 Mackenzie Gray"]}, {"page": "Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers", "response": ["* Mackenzie Gray: Kafta"]}, {"page": "Jax-Ur", "response": ["Jax-Ur appears in Man of Steel, portrayed by Mackenzie Gray in the DC Extended Universe.
