He wrote, in my opinion, more truthfully about the upper classes than any of his contemporaries. This study of family jealousy and dispossession in an old Scottish landowning family is as exciting as a thriller but its qualities are more than purely narrative. The people and the place are seen with an unmatched intensity and brought to life by a distinctive prose style of rare beauty and extraordinary expressive power.\"\u2014Francis Wyndham"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Hugo Charteris"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Hugo Charteris (1910) : H.
