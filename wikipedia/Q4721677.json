After World War II, he changed his nationality to British, and his name to Alf Francis. He became a racing mechanic for Stirling Moss and the Chief Mechanic at Rob Walker Racing Team.\nAt Rob Walker Racing Team, he maintained many Grand Prix cars including Cooper-Climax and Lotus 18, and helped developing the team's own Formula 1 car called Walker Special. Working with transmission engineer and designer Valerio Colotti, he became a partner of Colotti-Francis, and moved to Italy.\nIn 1963 he returned to England, where he was involved in the unsuccessful Derrington-Francis Formula One project. He subsequently immigrated to the US, where he built cars for lower racing formulae. He died in Oklahoma City in 1983.\nIn 1957 he authored his biography Alf Francis: Racing Mechanic with journalist Peter Lewis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 28", "response": ["*1983 \u2013 Alf Francis, German-English motor racing mechanic and racing car constructor (b. 1918)"]}, {"page": "June 18", "response": ["*1918 \u2013 Alf Francis, West Prussia-born, English motor racing mechanic and race car constructor (d. 1983)"]}, {"page": "Automobili Turismo e Sport", "response": ["The ATS would later be used in the Derrington-Francis project spearheaded by the Rob Walker Racing Team's former chief mechanic, Alf Francis.

His principal mount that year was a Cooper-Maserati T81, painted in Swiss racing red and white. The year started promisingly at the season-opening non-Championship 1966 BRDC International Trophy at the Silverstone Circuit, with Bonnier qualifying the Cooper in sixth place and finishing a strong third, but the rest of the season brought little joy. A crash in the first lap of the Belgian Grand Prix destroyed his Cooper T81. While the car was repaired Bonnier entered an Alf Francis built Cooper-ATS at the French Grand Prix. After the Cooper-ATS did not prove to be competitive in practice Bonnier made a deal with the Brabham team and drove their spare car for the rest of the weekend. Bonnier's Cooper T81 was repaired in time for the Dutch Grand Prix after having driven a Brabham BT7 at the British Grand Prix.

Transmission was through an Alf Francis-designed Colotti six-speed gearbox which, although technically advanced, would be the BT3's Achilles heel as it proved to be somewhat fragile. Wheel location was by fully independent double wishbone suspension arrangements at all four corners, with smaller than usual 13\u00a0inch wheels. Braking was initially by  diameter disc brakes on each wheel, but these proved insufficient and these were increased to  at the front following the car's second race. This also required 15\u00a0inch front wheels, which negatively affected the handling.Blunsden (October 1962), p. 25"]}, {"page": "Alfred Francis (disambiguation)", "response": ["Alfred or Alf Francis may also refer to:", "*Alf Francis, motor racing mechanic", "*Alf Francis (ice hockey) in MJHL All-Star Teams"]}]}}
