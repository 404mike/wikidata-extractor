David Pringle wrote of the novel: \"This is a sword-and-sorcery tale, yet it borders on sf by virtue of its distant future setting and the conceit that most of the 'magic' is in fact ancient, little-understood science. Despite its obvious debts to Jack Vance and Michael Moorcock, it's a very moody and stylish entertainment.David Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction. Grafton, 1990, p. 67 Reviewing the novel for Delap's F & SF, Michael Bishop opined that \"my own gut feeling is that M. John Harrison is wasting his time and his gift with this sort of material\" but that \"if you like elegantly crafted, elegantly written sword and sorcery, this book is all you could ask for.\" Delap's F & Sf (Jan 1977), p. 21.
