Chomsky complained about the interview in a letter to the readers\u2019 editor, Ian Mayes, on 3 November 2005, after which Media Lens responded with their first article on this issue on 4 November. Within a few weeks, The Guardian apologised to Chomsky for three significant errors in the story including that Brockes had misrepresented Chomsky's views on the Srebrenica massacre and the nature of his support for Diana Johnstone. The Guardian also wrote that \"[n]either Prof Chomsky nor Ms Johnstone have ever denied the fact of the massacre\". Media Lens responded to The Guardian 's apology in a second article posted on 21 November. The repercussions of the Brockes interview continued for some time. Ian Mayes, then the readers' editor of The Guardian, wrote on 12 December 2005 that he and Brockes had received \"several hundred\" emails from Media Lens followers, who were protesting about Chomsky\u2019s treatment.

The term \"British\" had also never applied to Ireland until at least the late 16th century\"Geographers may have formed the habit of referring to the archipelago consisting of Britain and Ireland as the Britannic isles, but there never had been a historical myth linking the islands. Medieval historians, such as the twelfth-century Geoffrey of Monmouth, had developed the idea that Britain (i.e. England, Scotland, and Wales) had first been settled by Trojan refugees fleeing after the capture and destruction of their city by the Greeks. The founding monarch \u2014 Brutus \u2014 had then divided up the island between his three sons, the eldest (Albion) inheriting England and the younger sons Scotland and Wales. This permitted English antiquarians to claim a superiority for the English nation and the English Crown. In the fourteenth century the Scots developed their own counter-myth which acknowledged that Trojans had first occupied England and Wales, but asserted that Scotland had been occupied by colonists from Greece \u2013 the conquerors of Troy. Faced by such Scottish counter-myths and by the scepticism bred of humanist scholarship, few people took any of these historical claims seriously by 1600. English claims that kings of Scotland had regularly recognised the feudal suzerainty of the English Crown had to be abandoned in 1603 when the Scottish royal house inherited the English Crown. But the fact is that many of the inhabitants of Britain \u2013 especially intellectuals around the royal Courts \u2013 had for centuries conceptualised a relationship which bound them together into a common history. There was no historical myths binding Ireland into the story. The term 'Britain' was widely understood and it excluded Ireland; there was no geopolitical term binding together the archipelago.\" John Morrill, 1996, The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain, Oxford University Press: Oxford.  \"When I refer to the composite monachy ruled over by James VI and I and by King Charles I, it is always described as Britain and Ireland, and I deliberately avoid the politically loaded phrase 'the British Isles' not least because this was not a normal usage in the political discourse of the time.\" Canny, Nicholas (2001). op. cit., p. viii. and onwards. This period coincided with the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the subsequent Cromwellian activities in Ireland, the Williamite accession in Britain and the Williamite War in Ireland\u2014all of which resulted in severe impact on the Irish people, landowners and native aristocracy. From that perspective, the term \"British Isles\" is not a neutral geographical term but an unavoidably political one. Use of the name \"British Isles\" is often rejected in the Republic of Ireland, because some claim its use implies a primacy of British identity over all the islands outside the United Kingdom, including the Irish state and the Crown dependencies of the Isle of Man and Channel Islands, that was historically dominating and is currently inaccurate, since Ireland is neither Britain nor British.The readers' editor of The Guardian, Ian Mayes, noted indirect reports of concerns. \"Where are we?\", The Guardian, 11 August 2001.On 18 July 2004 The Sunday Business Post  questioned the use of British Isles as a purely geographic expression, noting:"]}, {"page": "Mayes", "response": ["* Ian Mayes, British journalist and editor"]}, {"page": "Henry Bird (artist)", "response": ["Henry Bird (15 July 1909 \u2013 16 April 2000) was an English artist from Northampton who painted murals and female nudes.Ian Mayes (11 May 2000), Henry Bird Obituary, The Guardian.David Buckman (22 April 2000), Henry Bird Obituary, The Independent.
