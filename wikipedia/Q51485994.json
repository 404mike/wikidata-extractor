He is credited with introducing multidisciplinary care to the management of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). When he retired at the age of 60, four consultants were appointed to replace him.\nIn the 1960s, working as a research fellow with neurologist John Walton, he studied the genetics and clinical features of the diseases of muscles, particularly relating to the identification of female carriers of DMD.\nParallel to his career in medicine was his interest in natural history and involvement with the Natural History Society of Northumbria, the binding and restoration of books and studies on Thomas Bewick. He finished a study of Bewick's family history and contributed to the Bewick Birthplace Trust's campaign to preserve Bewick's birthplace of Cherryburn in Northumberland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Natural History Society of Northumbria", "response": ["*David Gardner-Medwin (1936\u20132014) was a paediatric neurologist who worked with children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
