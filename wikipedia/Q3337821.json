He was associated with Bo Xilai (the former Communist Party of China Committee Secretary for Chongqing, and a member of the Chinese Politburo).\nHeywood was found dead in a hotel room in Chongqing, and initial official reports (which have subsequently been challenged) attributed his death to alcohol poisoning. Media reports have suggested the former chief of police under Bo, Wang Lijun, may have had information concerning Heywood's death.Soon after Heywood's death (6 February 2012), Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, and allegedly told US diplomats of Heywood having been poisoned, and Bo's family was involved in corruption. The incident precipitated Bo's high-profile sacking two weeks later. According to a reinvestigation by the Chinese authorities, evidence indicates Heywood having been murdered, with Bo Xilai's wife Gu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun, an orderly at Bo's home, being \"highly suspected\", according to Xinhua News. On 26 July 2012, Gu Kailai was charged with the murder of Heywood and in August was convicted of the crime.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 14", "response": ["*  2011   \u2013 Neil Heywood, English-Chinese businessman (b. 1970)"]}, {"page": "October 20", "response": ["*  1970   \u2013 Neil Heywood, English-Chinese businessman (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "2012", "response": ["* March 15 \u2013 Communist party chief of Chongqing Bo Xilai, well known for his neo-Maoist leanings and policies, is removed from his post after a large scandal involving the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood and an incident involving the Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun."]}, {"page": "Bo Xilai", "response": ["Bo was considered a likely candidate for promotion to the elite CCP Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012.

In the fallout, Bo was removed as the CCP Committee secretary of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo.
