Elphinstone's successor, George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale, found Elliot working in a whole range of capacities, and well beyond his position as a private secretary. He held also a position as a translator (of Canarese) to the Government. Elliot was then employed in the board of revenue. In 1845 he was appointed to examine Guntur district which had been hit by the major famine of 1833 and had not shown signs of recovery. Elliot found deep-seated corruption and collusion between village elites, local revenue officials, and five zamindar families that held most of the land in the district. The East India Company's court of directors were impressed by his work and appointed him commissioner of the Northern Circars, a position of responsibility that he managed until 1854 when he became a Member of the Council of the Governor of Madras. During 1858, Elliot temporarily replaced George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris and Governor of the Madras Presidency as the provisional governor; it fell to him to announce that following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Honourable East India Company's responsibilities would be transferred to the The Crown, beginning the British Raj."]}, {"page": "George Francis Robert Harris", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris"]}, {"page": "George Francis Robert Harris, 3rd Baron Harris", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris"]}, {"page": "Lord Harris (disambiguation)", "response": ["* George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris (1810\u20131872), Governor of Trinidad and Madras"]}, {"page": "List of Trinidad and Tobago\u2013related topics", "response": ["* George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris"]}, {"page": "Index of Trinidad and Tobago\u2013related articles", "response": ["*George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris"]}, {"page": "Governor Harris", "response": ["* George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris (1810\u20131872), Governor of Trinidad from 1846 to 1854 and Governor of Madras from 1854 to 1859"]}, {"page": "Household of Edward VII and Alexandra", "response": ["*1863\u20131873: George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris"]}]}}
