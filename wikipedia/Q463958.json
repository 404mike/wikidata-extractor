He played guitar in British rock band Mot\u00f6rhead from 1984 to 1995, playing on six studio albums and two live albums. W\u00fcrzel died at the age of 61, following heart complications.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mot\u00f6rhead", "response": ["After Robertson's departure in 1983, the band were sent tapes from all over the world from potential guitarists. The group returned to the concept of dual lead guitars by hiring unknowns W\u00fcrzel and Phil Campbell (formerly of Persian Risk). In February 1984, the Lemmy, Campbell, W\u00fcrzel, and Taylor line-up recorded \"Ace of Spades\" for the \"Bambi\" episode in the British television series, The Young Ones. Scenes of the band playing are interspersed with the characters' antics as they rush to the railway station, in a parody of The Beatles' comedy film A Hard Day's Night. Taylor quit the band after that recording, causing Lemmy to quip: \"Did I leave them or did they leave me?\". Before joining Mot\u00f6rhead, Phil Campbell had met former Saxon drummer Pete Gill, and the trio decided to call him to see if he would like to visit London. The try-outs went well and Gill was hired.", "From 26 March to 3 April 1986, the band toured West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark on their \"Easter Metal Blast\" and in June, played two dates in Bologna and Milan in Italy. The court case with Bronze was finally settled in the band's favour. The band's management instigated their own label, GWR. Recording took place in Master Rock Studios, London and the single \"Deaf Forever\" was released on 5 July as a taster for the Orgasmatron album, which was released on 9 August. On the same day as the release of the album, Lemmy and W\u00fcrzel were interviewed by Andy Kershaw on the BBC Radio 1 Saturday Live show and \"Orgasmatron\" and \"Deaf Forever\" were played. The single reached No. 67 and the album reached No. 21 in the UK charts.", "In 1987, during the filming of Eat the Rich \u2013 in which Lemmy was taking a starring role alongside well-known comedy actors such as Robbie Coltrane, Kathy Burke, the regulars from The Comic Strip ensemble, and various other musician cameo appearances \u2013 Gill left the band and Taylor returned to appear in the band's cameo as \"In House Club Band\" alongside W\u00fcrzel and Campbell. The band wrote \"Eat the Rich\" especially for the film, its soundtrack featured tracks from Orgasmatron and W\u00fcrzel's solo single \"Bess\". The band's second album for GWR was Rock 'n' Roll, released on 5 September, after a tight work schedule in the studio. While having some popular tracks and using \"Eat the Rich\" as its second track, the band commented that the album was virtually \"nailed together\".", "The band's 1995 touring schedule began in Europe in late April. In June, they went on a second tour with Black Sabbath, this time supported by Tiamat, until the band succumbed to influenza and headed back to Los Angeles and Cherokee Studios in Hollywood where they were to record an album. During the sessions it became clear that W\u00fcrzel was not extending himself and left the band after the recording.White Line Fever, pp. 266\u2013269. The title track from the album, Sacrifice, was later used in the movie Tromeo and Juliet, a film in which Lemmy appears as the narrator. The band decided to continue as a three-man line-up and a tour of Europe was performed throughout October and the first two days of November. A three-day tour of South America followed the week after. Lemmy celebrated his 50th Birthday later that year with the band at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles; Metallica played at the event under the name \"The Lemmy's\".", "Mot\u00f6rhead performed an invitation-only concert at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London on 22 February 2004; at Summer Festivals in South America during May; and in Europe during June, July and August. They had already spent time in the studio, working on Inferno, which was released on 22 June and followed by the \"Inferno\" tour of Ireland with Class of Zero for three dates. Joined by Sepultura, the tour hit Great Britain. Some of the London show at the Hammersmith Apollo was filmed for TV as Gene Simmons introduced the extra opening act The Class, made up of school children from his Channel 4 series Rock School. W\u00fcrzel guested on \"Overkill\". The band continued the tour with Sepultura across Europe through the rest of November and December. At the show in Magdeburg, Germany on 4 December Mot\u00f6rhead joined Sepultura on stage during their support slot playing the song \"Orgasmatron\", in celebration of Sepultura's 20th Anniversary. The show on 7 December at the Philipshalle in D\u00fcsseldorf was recorded and later released as the Stage Fright DVD.", "On 9 July 2011, former guitarist W\u00fcrzel died of a heart attack.

The Gigantour took place from 26 January to 28 February 2012, but Mot\u00f6rhead missed the final four shows because Lemmy had a combination of an upper respiratory viral infection and voice strain, resulting in severe laryngitis. Lemmy wrote on Facebook, \"I'm giving my voice a good rest\", hoping he would recover soon to play at the Mayhem Festival, which was held from 30 June to 5 August 2012.
