Ilott played his first Test in the third match of the 1993 Ashes, a match in which England gave debuts to four players (most notably Graham Thorpe), Ilott took four wickets in the match but only four more in his next two matches and was subsequently left out of the side. After an impressive 1995 season with Essex taking 78 wickets he was recalled to the side for the tour to South Africa, Ilott took 3/48 in the third Test yet was injured in the fourth Test.\nIlott enjoyed a 15 year first-class career with Essex. He was born at Watford in Hertfordshire and lives in Potters Bar. He studied at Francis Combe School and Community College.

Although not noted for his batting, in 1999, playing in his final Test at Old Trafford, he made the second-longest duck in Test history, from 52 balls, against New Zealand, and earned a standing ovation.http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997/ENG_LOCAL/NWT/KNOCK-OUTS/ESSEX_GLAM_NWT-SF_12-13AUG1997_MR"]}, {"page": "Hertfordshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Mark Ilott was the county's youngest debutant aged 16 before going on to open the bowling for Essex for 15 years.
