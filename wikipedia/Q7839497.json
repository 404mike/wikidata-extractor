He played 130 league games in the English Football League, 100 league games in the League of Ireland, and won one cap for Northern Ireland in 1995.\nHe began his career at Brighton & Hove Albion, but did not feature in the first team before he signed with Port Vale in May 1988. Mostly a back-up keeper for the \"Valiants\", he moved on to Walsall in May 1994. He helped the \"Saddlers\" to promotion out of the Third Division in 1994\u201395, before he signed with Hereford United in 1997. He then moved to Ireland to play for St Patrick's Athletic, and helped his new club to the League of Ireland title in 1997\u201398 and 1998\u201399, before he retired in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Football Association", "response": ["A loophole was closed in May 2008 by FIFA which allowed players born in the Channel Islands to choose which home nation within the United Kingdom they will represent at international level.

Three executive boxes were also purchased from Newcastle United, whilst facilities were opened to the local community. Manager John Rudge made a \u00a340,000 offer for Bristol City's left-sided midfielder Alan Walsh, which was rejected. He also made inquiries for Nigel Gleghorn and Marc North. Ray Walker put in a transfer request, which was rejected. Rudge's first purchase of the season was Sunderland's left-sided midfielder Paul Atkinson, with a tribunal setting the fee at \u00a320,000; Rudge stated that he \"has the ability to produce the sort of crosses that win games\". His next target was a striker, though he had a \u00a370,000 bid for Hull City's Andy Saville rejected. Attempts to capture Imre Varadi, Wayne Biggins, Keith Bertschin, Andy Jones, and John Pearson all failed. Ian Moores began training with the club, but was not offered a contract. Despite interest from at least three other clubs (particularly Mansfield Town), Rudge signed Ron Futcher, Bradford City's top-scorer, for a \u00a335,000 fee. The veteran striker said \"I could have done better for myself elsewhere, but Vale have a lot more potential.\" Another new arrival was young Brighton & Hove Albion goalkeeper Trevor Wood on a free transfer. The Vale were unbeaten in their seven pre-season friendlies, beating second tier rivals Stoke City 1\u20130 in the process. They also recorded wins over Newcastle Town (6\u20131), Brandon (2\u20131), Spennymoor (3\u20130), and Kidderminster Harriers (4\u20130), and drew 2\u20132 with Walsall and 1\u20131 with Crewe Alexandra. Having failed to sign Phil Turner, Rudge felt the squad's one weakness was a lack of depth in defence.", "Vale opened October with a 3\u20133 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux; it was an exciting encounter, as Vale's short passing game proved the equal of the dangerous long ball game of \"Wolves\". Two days later they claimed a 2\u20130 victory over Huddersfield Town, with Trevor Wood keeping a clean sheet on his debut after Grew was sidelined with a thigh strain. A 2\u20130 win over injury-stricken Wigan Athletic at Springfield Park was the club's fifth clean sheet in six league games. Rudge meanwhile agreed a \u00a3175,000 deal to bring Andy Jones back from Charlton Athletic, but the striker refused the deal. Yet an injury-time goal from Ray Walker was enough to continue the team's fine run, as a solid Bolton Wanderers outfit were beaten 2\u20131; despite still suffering from injury, Grew made a series of impressive saves. With goalkeeper Mark Grew out with a thigh strain, Mike Stowell was taken in on loan from Everton. The month ended poorly, as a 3\u20132 loss to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road was followed by a 3\u20133 draw with Sheffield United in front of 13,246 fans (the biggest gate for a league game since 1973). The two northern sides exploited Vale's unease at playing with a new goalkeeper, and forced errors from the Vale defence with high-pressure aerial bombardment. On 29 October, Rudge kept the team in the dressing room for 45 minutes at Griffin Park after a poor performance left the distinctly average home side, Brentford, to secure all three points.", "|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Trevor Wood", "| May 1988 || GK ||  || Trevor Wood || Brighton & Hove Albion || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Trevor Wood"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Trevor Wood"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season  started poorly, with the Vale picking up just one win in the opening eight games.
