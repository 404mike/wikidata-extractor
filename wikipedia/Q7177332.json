Tizard was principally notable for important research into neonatology and paediatric neurology and being a founder member of the Neonatal Society in 1959. Tizard was considered the most distinguished academic children's physician of his generation.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June Lloyd, Baroness Lloyd of Highbury", "response": ["Lloyd retired from practising medicine in 1992, but played a role in transforming the British Paediatric Association (abbr. BPA) into the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. It was originally thought that Lloyd would become president of the BPA, after being honorary secretary for a number of years, but Lloyd believed that the paediatricians should have their own college. She was a member of an influential group with the BPA, which enabled her to push for the establishment of a new college. It was a contentious issue, as many in the profession believed it was not necessary, and there was serious differences of opinion, when looking in hindsight Sir Peter Tizard and his research group at Hammersmith Hospital, were one group of dissenting voices, who believed that Paediatrics should have the same intellectual footing for medicine for children, as medicine for adults, within general medicine, rather than a speciality. However, it was thanks to her, and people like the great Otto Wolff and Roy Meadow who were aligned with her ideal that the argument was won. Roy Meadow would become the first president, but she would feature on the coat of arms of the new college, in which she is a supporter holding a staff of Aesculapius entwined with a double helix rather than the traditional snake.  The other supporter was Thomas Phaire, whose Boke of Chyldren from 1545 was the first book on paediatrics in English, the crest is a baby, taken from the arms of the Foundling Hospital in Coram's Fields. Lloyd took over responsibility for training and standards for paediatricians that had previously been under the control of the Royal College of Physicians."]}, {"page": "Tizard", "response": ["* Peter Tizard (1916\u20131993), British paediatrician"]}, {"page": "Neonatal Society", "response": ["Previous presidents include David Hull, Robert McCance, Peter Tizard, Elsie Widdowson, Maureen Young, Andrew Wilkinson and, the current president-elect of the British Medical Association, Neena Modi."]}]}}
