Introduced in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, he was brought to life both as a puppet and a costumed actor during the film.

The character was voiced by Kipsang Rotich, a Kenyan student who spoke in his native Kalenjin, as well as in Kikuyu. Quinn and Rotich both returned for the role in the sequel trilogy, namely Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019).", "Nien Nunb was brought to life by both a puppeteer and as a costumed-actor during the film. Initially, he was just to appear in the briefing room scenes, and the Endor celebration. For these appearances he was portrayed by stuntman Richard Bonehill, in costume and mask. However, Nunb was later chosen, by series creator George Lucas, to appear in the Millennium Falcon, as Lando Calrissian's co-pilot. Since the character now had dialogue, it was decided that the mask would be reworked into a puppet, with mechanisms to allow for moving lips and eyes. For these scenes, in the cockpit, the role was handed over to puppeteer Mike Quinn."]}, {"page": "Jason and the Argonauts (miniseries)", "response": ["*Richard Bonehill as Ae\u00ebtes' 2nd General"]}, {"page": "List of Star Wars cast members", "response": ["| Richard Bonehill", "| Richard Bonehill", "| Richard Bonehill", "| colspan=\"2\" | Richard BonehillTrevor ButterfieldRalph Morse"]}, {"page": "2015 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4 || Richard Bonehill || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 67 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| English || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor, Stuntman || "]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2015", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4 || Richard Bonehill || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 67 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| English || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor, stuntman || "]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Richard Bonehill, 67, actor and stuntman (Doctor Who, Return of the Jedi)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2015", "response": ["*Richard Bonehill, 67, British actor and stuntman (Doctor Who, Return of the Jedi, Flash Gordon).Star Wars Character Actor Richard Bonehill Dies At 67"]}, {"page": "Bonehill, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Bonehill"]}, {"page": "List of Star Wars film actors", "response": ["| Richard BonehillMike QuinnKipsang Rotich", "| Richard BonehillMike QuinnPaul Springer"]}, {"page": "2015 deaths in British television", "response": ["|Richard Bonehill"]}]}}
