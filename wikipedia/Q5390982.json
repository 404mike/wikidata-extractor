Feeling that he had played a significant part in the Police's first two albums, Gray negotiated for a \u00a325,000 fee, which brought the album's total budget to \u00a335,000 (more than twice the combined budgets of their first two albums, but still exceptionally cheap for a band who at that point had become established stars).", "The record has two instrumentals, \"The Other Way of Stopping\" (named from a line in Bob Newhart's \"The Driving Instructor\" routine) and \"Behind My Camel\". \"Behind My Camel\" was guitarist Andy Summers' first entirely self-penned composition. As bassist and vocalist Sting refused to play on it, Summers recorded the bass line himself, overdubbing the guitar parts. According to Sting, \"I hated that song so much that, one day when I was in the studio, I found the tape lying on the table. So I took it around the back of the studio and actually buried it in the garden.\" Nigel Gray believed that the title was an in-joke by Summers: \"He didn't tell me this himself but I'm 98% sure the reason is this: what would you find behind a camel? A monumental pile of shit.\"", "\"Bombs Away\" was recorded on a tape that Nigel Gray had just used with Siouxsie and the Banshees.

The \"t\" from \"Ritch in a Ditch\" was omitted from the album version. Like the first two of The Police's albums, Klark Kent was recorded on a minimal budget at Surrey Sound Studios in Leatherhead,  with Nigel Gray engineering. Some of the music and themes in the album reflect Copeland's songwriting for The Police. They are normally in an upbeat tempo and address with sarcasm issues like suburban living and Third World politics. The song \"Guerrilla\" features some Arab words Copeland learned while growing up in Beirut. The main riff of the song \"Excess\" would be re-used later for the soundtrack of Rumble Fish. \"Theme from Kinetic Ritual\" would later be used by MTV as the opening theme of the show The Cutting Edge. Copeland disseminated a few hints about his real identity in the design of the album. In the inner sleeve there is a collage of pictures where a photograph of The Police performing with Henry Padovani is visible. In all the pictures in the album Copeland can be seen wearing a black and yellow sweater with hooped stripes in reference to how Sting originally earned his nickname.
