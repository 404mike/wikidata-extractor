He was a leading figure in geological exploration and research in Svalbard, organising over 40 Cambridge Spitsbergen Expeditions (CSE) and in 1975 founded the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme (CASP) as a research institute to continue this work. He was first secretary of the International Geological Correlation Programme from 1969 until UNESCO could take over in 1972, and was a driving force in setting criteria and standards in stratigraphy and producing 4 editions of the geological time scale in 1964, 1971, 1982 and 1989.  He also edited the international Geological Magazine for 30 years. In 1968, he was honoured with the Royal Geographical Society Gold Medal for Arctic exploration and research.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Snowball Earth", "response": ["In 1964, the idea of global-scale glaciation reemerged when W. Brian Harland published a paper in which he presented palaeomagnetic data showing that glacial tillites in Svalbard and Greenland were deposited at tropical latitudes. From this palaeomagnetic data, and the sedimentological evidence that the glacial sediments interrupt successions of rocks commonly associated with tropical to temperate latitudes, he argued that an ice age occurred that was so extreme that it resulted in marine glacial rocks being deposited in the tropics."]}, {"page": "Hadean", "response": ["The Hadean ( ) is a geologic eon of Earth history preceding the Archean.

However, a snowball Earth technically does not have continental ice sheets like during the icehouse state. \"The Great Infra-Cambrian Ice Age\" has been claimed to be the host of such a world, and in 1964, the scientist W. Brian Harland brought forth his discovery of indications of glaciers in the low latitudes (Harland and Rudwick). That became a problem for Harland because of the thought of the \"Runaway Snowball Paradox\" (a kind of Snowball effect) that once Earth enters the route of becoming a snowball Earth, it would never be able to leave that state. However,  brought up a solution to the paradox in 1992. Since the continents were then huddled at the low and the middle latitudes, there was less ocean water available to absorb the higher amount solar energy hitting the tropics, and there was also an increase in rainfall because more land exposed to higher solar energy might have caused chemical weathering, which would removing CO from the atmosphere. Both conditions might have caused a substantial drop in CO atmospheric levels which resulted in cooling temperatures and increasing ice albedo (ice reflectivity of incoming solar radiation), which would further increase global cooling (a positive feedback). That might have been the mechanism of entering Snowball Earth state. Kirschvink explained that the way to get out of Snowball Earth state could be connected again to carbon dioxide. A possible explanation is that during Snowball Earth, volcanic activity would not halt but accumulate atmospheric CO. At the same time, global ice cover would prevent chemical weathering (particularly hydrolysis), responsible for removal of CO from the atmosphere. CO therefore accumulated in the atmosphere. Once the atmosphere accumulation of CO reached a threshold, temperature would rise enough for ice sheets to start melting. That would in turn reduce the ice albedo effect, which would in turn further reduce the ice cover and allow an exit from Snowball Earth. At the end of Snowball Earth, before the equilibrium \"thermostat\" between volcanic activity and the by then slowly resuming chemical weathering was reinstated, CO in the atmosphere had accumulated enough to cause temperatures to peak to as much as 60\u00b0 C before they eventually settled down. Around the same geologic period of Snowball Earth (it is debated if it was the cause or the result of Snowball Earth), the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) was occurring. The event known as the Cambrian Explosion followed and produced the beginnings of populous bilateral organisms, as well as a greater diversity and mobility in multicellular life. However, some biologists claim that a complete snowball Earth could not have happened since photosynthetic life would not have survived under many meters of ice without sunlight. However, sunlight has been observed to penetrate meters of ice in Antarctica. Most scientists now believe that a \"hard\" Snowball Earth, one completely covered by ice, is probably impossible. However, a \"slushball Earth,\" with points of opening near the equator, is considered to be possible."]}, {"page": "Reginald Harland", "response": ["He was the great-nephew of British shipbuilder, Sir Edward Harland, and a relative of geologist, W.
