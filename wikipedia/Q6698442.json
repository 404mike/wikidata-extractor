Her sculptural work investigates the boundaries between the body and architecture, exploring their common social factors such as communication and identity. Orta's most emblematic works include: Refuge Wear and Body Architecture (1992\u20131998), portable architecture, lightweight and autonomous structures representing issues of survival. Nexus Architecture (1994\u20132002) are participative interventions in which a variable number of people wear suits connected to each other, shaping modular and collective structures, which visualise the concept of social link. Urban Life Guards (2004\u2013ongoing) are wearable objects that reflect on the body as a metaphorical supportive structure.\nOrta\u2019s work has been the focus of major survey exhibitions at the Wiener Secession Vienna (1999); USF Contemporary Art Museum, Tampa (2001), for which she received the Andy Warhol Foundation grant; and Barbican Art Gallery, London (2005).
