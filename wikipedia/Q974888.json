After various personnel changes, demo recordings, and a period of dormancy, they had returned to activity in 1985 with a lineup of Nicholas Bullen (vocals, bass), Justin Broadrick (guitar), and Miles Ratledge (drums).  Around this time, Daz Russell, promoter of the club The Mermaid in Birmingham, had essentially made Napalm Death the punk \"house band\" of his club.Alex Mudrian, Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal & Grindcore, Bazillion Points, 2016, pp. 103. Due to the local popularity of the band, this arrangement secured him the visitor numbers sufficient to generate enough revenue to pay the foreign bands playing at the club.Glasper, Trapped in a Scene, pp. 13. Napalm Death therefore supported all the hardcore punk bands that Russell booked, including Anti Cimex, Sacrilege, Heresy, Concrete Sox, and The Varukers. Bassist Peter Shaw also briefly played with the band while Bullen sang exclusively.  After recording their demo Hatred Surge, Shaw and founding drummer Ratledge departed, and the latter was replaced by Mick Harris in November 1985.  Harris aspired to play faster than any other drummer, citing U.S. hardcore bands Siege and Deep Wound as influences. The first live appearances with this lineup took place in January 1986 with Amebix and Instigators, and the new lineup had allowed the band to become more musically adept.Ian Glasper, Trapped in a Scene: UK Hardcore 1985-1989, Cherry Red Books, 2009, , pp. 15. In March 1986, the group entered Flick Studios and recorded the demo From Enslavement to Obliteration, combining their initial anarcho-punk influences with riffs akin to those of Celtic Frost and extremely fast drumming.Glasper, Trapped in a Scene, pp. 16."]}, {"page": "Final (band)", "response": ["Broadrick started a cassette label called Post Mortem Rekordings on which he released over 50 tapes until 1986, many of which were Final tapes.

The music from this period is expected to receive a boxset reissue on Hospital Productions."]}, {"page": "Shane Embury", "response": ["While not a founding member, Embury is the longest standing member of the band, having taken part in the Scum tour, replacing previous bassist Jim Whitely in 1987. He was a fan of the band before he joined, first seeing them perform at Midlands venue The Mermaid the previous year and becoming close friends of the members of the band, particularly Mick Harris. Nicholas Bullen, the founding member of the band, originally asked Shane to join them before the recording of the B-side of the debut album Scum but Shane eventually declined due to nervousness, his biggest regret."]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Nicholas Bullen (Napalm Death)"]}, {"page": "Justin Broadrick", "response": ["In 1982, he started publishing tapes with his friend Andy Swan, who had a synthesizer. The first name they went under was Atrocity Exhibition, named after a Joy Division track (which, itself, takes its name from a book by J. G. Ballard). Their first recording was titled Live in the Studio and was the first catalogued release on their cassette label Post Mortem Rekordings. Shortly after, the project was named Smear Campaign, after a Nocturnal Emissions track. This was the name they went under at their first live performance on 7 July 1984 in The Mermaid in Birmingham. Promptly after the show they settled on the name Final. Final was then inspired lyrically and musically by acts such as Throbbing Gristle and Maurizio Bianchi. \"We were pretty heavily into the whole industrial tape culture and fanzines of the very early '80s\", Broadrick says. The project developed to embrace the power electronics subgenre of industrial music in 1983, releasing material by them and other industrial projects on Post Mortem Rekordings (which was renamed Uprising Productions in 1985) such as Family Patrol Group, Mental Health Act, Ashenden, The Grey Wolves, Con-Dom, Death Magazine 52, Fern and Un-Kommuniti. Final went under numerous lineup changes during its lifetime, including musicians like Philip Timms, Daniel Johnson, Paul Neville, Nicholas Bullen, Graham Robertson and Guy Pearce.Final \"One\", Sentrax, 1993 \"I had about 50 Final releases over about a year and a half\", he says. Other project names Broadrick recorded under included Last Exit, Crusade and Dead Pulp. Broadrick also had a short-lived progressive punk band called The Blakk Korridor with Diarmuid Dalton and Dan.", "Broadrick met Nicholas Bullen in 1985 at the flea market where he met Andy. Broadrick gave Final tapes to Bullen and they recorded some material together. \"Then I played him some of the stuff I did with guitar, which he then played to another guy in Napalm Death. Basically, they were impressed with what I was doing with guitar, and so I joined Napalm Death\", Broadrick says. Soon Mick Harris (then member of a psychobilly band) joined the lineup and they shifted from metal to grindcore. \"Nick and I left Napalm Death after we recorded the first side of Scum. I'd had enough of Napalm Death very, very quickly\", he says. Lee Dorrian and Jim Whitely joined to replace Bullen and Broadrick. Broadrick gave the first side to Earache Records founder Digby Pearson, who then contacted the new Napalm Death that had recorded the second side."]}, {"page": "King Henry VIII School, Coventry", "response": ["* Nicholas Bullen, musician, composer and writer, co-founder of Napalm Death."]}, {"page": "You Suffer", "response": ["\"You Suffer\" is a song by British grindcore band Napalm Death from their debut album, Scum (1987).
