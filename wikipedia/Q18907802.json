Scott was responsible for recruiting the correspondent Robert Dell whose role in Paris was to communicate on secret negotiations with the Quai D'Orsay and Bureau Anglais in a weekly column called \"From Our Correspondent, Paris, Friday\".  Despite Lloyd George's objection to the reporter's anonymity there remained little chance of compromising their French colleagues in a city already renowned for prostitution.
