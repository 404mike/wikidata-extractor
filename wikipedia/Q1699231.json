He won a gold medal from the Board of Agriculture for two of these essays.\"Breaking Up and Relaying Clay\" & \"Cabbages\" in Communications to the Board of Agriculture, vol. iv (London, 1805), pp. 16\u201323 & 178. Of broader appeal, and attracting more interest, were his \"Essays on Agricultural Machines\" as published in the Board of Agriculture's Communications of 1810. These covered: a new design for a dynanometer (his spelling of dynamometer) for measuring the relative resistances of ploughs or the weight needed to draw them forward; the construction of a new roller and set of harrows; the breaking of horses and oxen; and the construction of carriage wheels 'upon a new principle'. The most important of these essays, however, was \"On the Mathematical Construction of a Plough\" in which he offered an original and practical solution to the problem of efficient plough design with special reference to the mouldboard.Communications to the Board of Agriculture, vol. vi, part ii, (London, 1810), pp.437\u2013454. It was in the course of this essay that he challenged Thomas Jefferson's claim to have discovered the mathematical principles for constructing a mould-board of least resistance.Jefferson, Thomas. \"The Description of a Mold-Board of the least resistence [sic]\", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 4 (1799), pp. 313\u2013322. This prompted one of Jefferson's nineteenth-century admirers to vilify Amos posthumously,Henry S Randall, \"President Jefferson's Plow\" in Transactions of the New York State Agricultural Society, (Albany, 1863), vol. xxii (1862), pp. 66\u201373. though less partisan American critics subsequently declared Jefferson's design to be badly flawed.Transactions of the New York State Agricultural Society, (Albany, 1868), vol. xxvii (1867), pp. 412\u2013413. Amos's approach to plough construction, though it built on the work of others, particularly of John Bailey (1750\u20131819), earned him a place in the history of plough design.See, for example, Encyclopedia Metropolitana or Universal Dictionary of Knowledge (1845), ed. Rev. Edward Smedley et al., vol. xiv, p.233."]}, {"page": "General View of Agriculture county surveys", "response": ["|John Bailey, George Culley", "|John Bailey", "|John Bailey, George Culley"]}, {"page": "George Culley", "response": ["Culley published works on agriculture, mostly with John Bailey, and was in correspondence with Arthur Young.
