Their territory on the left bank of the Rhine had belonged to the Mediomatrici during the time of Caesar and Strabo, but the Nemetes must have crossed the river and settled there sometime afterward.George Long. \"Mediomatrici\", from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography. Under the Roman administrative organization of Gaul, the Nemetes constituted a civitas of the province of Upper Germany with a relatively small territory extending from the Rhine into the Palatinate Forest and an administrative centre at Speyer. Ptolemy mentions Neomagus (i.e. Noviomagus) and Rufiniana as the towns of the Nemetes;Claudius Ptolemaeus. Geographia, II:8. if the latter is to be identified with Rouffach, Ptolemy is mistaken in attributing it to the Nemetes, for Rouffach is far to the south in Rauracan territory.George Long. \"Rufiniana\", from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography.In fact, the mistake comes from more modern historians, because Rufiniana cannot be the former name of Rouffach. It is impossible for three reasons : 1 - The ancient forms of this place-name are known as Rubiaco en 662, Rubac 912, Rubiacum 12th. 2 - The end of Rufiniana supposes two suffixes -ini(us?)-ana and Rubiaco has only one -aco. 3 - The first element Ruf- cannot change to [b] into Latin Rub-. On the contrary, the shift from [b] to [p] and finally to [f] (Rubac > *Rupach > Rouffach) is the typical result of the High German consonant shift, that took place a long time after Ptolemy's death. It may also be supposed that Saletio (Seltz) belonged to the Nemetes, as in modern times it belonged to the diocese of Speyer; Saletio would have been near the northern limits of the Triboci, whose civitas later became the diocese of Strasbourg.George Long. \"Triboci\", from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography.

Ausonius invokes fons, the manmade outlet that makes the water available to the people, with a string of adjectives: sacer, alme, perennis, / vitree, glauce, profunde, sonore, illimis, opace,Ausonius, Ordo nobilium urbium 20.30\u201331 (Green lines 157\u2013158). The adjectives are masculine to agree with fons and appear in the vocative case, as is customary for a Latin invocation. \"sacred, life-giving, eternal, / glassy, blue-green,The color word glaucus (Greek glaukos) evokes a range of grey, green, and blue indeterminately, and can often be translated as \"sea-colored\" or even \"sky-colored.\" It has divine connotations and is associated with various deities, for instance, as the color of Athena's eyes. See P.G. Maxwell-Stuart, Studies in Greek Colour Terminology: \u0393\u039b\u0391\u03a5\u039a\u039f\u03a3 (Brill, 1981), vol. 1, pp. 40\u201342, and a brief discussion of the color as associated with Pluto. measureless, sonorous, free of mud, shaded.\" He hails fons as the \"Genius of the city\" (urbis genius) having the power to offer a healing draught (medico potabilis haustu). In the next line, Ausonius says that this genius or tutelary deity is Divona in the Celtic language (Divona Celtarum lingua), that is, fons added to the divae (plural).The phrase fons addite divis is somewhat difficult to interpret. It is sometimes construed as \"fons\" addite \"divis\", that is \"Add (plural imperative) the word fons to the word divae/divi\" (masculine singular divus). In the plural dative and ablative cases, the masculine and feminine forms are the same, and divis could be either, but Ausonius seems to be connecting the masculine fons to the feminine Divona. In Latin, the word lymphae, plural, means \"waters\" but is also an Italic word for \"nymphs\"; a plural divae here might suggest the same tendency to regard water nymphs as both a singular and a plural collective. The verbal form addite, however, can also be construed as a perfect passive participle in the vocative case, parallel in construction with the string of vocative adjectives, that is, \"Fons, added to the goddesses.\" Ausonius \"hails\" (salve) the \"Genius of the city,\" but genius is not in the vocative case. Fons addite divis is sometimes taken as a proffered etymology: Ausonius may be proposing that the word Divona is formed from the word divus, Gaulish devos, plus fons = -ona, taking fons as the equivalent of a Gaulish word onno, \"stream, river,\" the existence of which is doubtful. The suffix -ona is found in the names of several Gallic goddesses.
