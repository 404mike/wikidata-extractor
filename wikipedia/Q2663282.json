With Thomas injured, Hart made his first league start on 27 September, playing at left-wing in a 3\u20131 home win over Millwall. His performance impressed Ribeiro, who stated that Hart played well enough to guarantee himself either the left-back or left-wing spot in the next game. He scored his first goal in senior football on 29 October, in a 3\u20131 defeat to hometown club Bolton Wanderers at the Macron Stadium. Hart's loan deal was cut short after Michael Brown succeeded Ribeiro as manager in January 2017; he had made 12 starts and four substitute appearances for the \"Valiants\", often out of position on the left and right-wing.

However it would be 20-year old centre-back Nathan Smith who would prove to be the club's best player; Riberio handed him his debut on the opening day of the season, and Smith would retain his first-team place long after Riberio's departure. He appointed Jak Alnwick, Ben Purkiss and Anthony Grant as joint-captains, and got off to a good start by winning his first six home games at Vale Park. He was named as the Football League Paper's League One Manager of the Day after Vale defeated Scunthorpe United 3\u20131 on 27 August. However they entered Christmas in 17th-place, leaving chairman Norman Smurthwaite to declare that 'Plan B' had been triggered, meaning the signing of \"seasoned, higher grade\" players, whilst he admitted he felt \"a little bit hoodwinked\" as Ribeiro's friends in the game (Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Aitor Karanka, and Carlos Carvalhal) had provided him with glowing references but had thus far failed to lend any of their players to the Vale. Ribeiro resigned as manager of Port Vale on 26 December, hours after witnessing his side lose 1\u20130 at home to Walsall.

Norwich City, Southampton, Crystal Palace, and West Bromwich Albion were all separated by just two points going into the final match. It was the first time since the establishment of the Premier League in 1992 that no team was assured of relegation going into the final matchday and the closest dogfight in the top flight since 1927\u201328, when 11 teams were separated by only two points going into the final matchday, in an era when a win was worth two points instead of today's three.

West Brom (who started the day bottom) needed to beat Portsmouth at The Hawthorns and they won 2\u20130 thanks to goals from Geoff Horsfield and Kieran Richardson meaning Baggies fans were having to nervously wait for other results. Norwich, who started in pole position, were thumped 6\u20130 at Fulham and were relegated after a dreadful display. Southampton meanwhile hosted Manchester United and looked like staying up after a John O'Shea own goal but the Irishman set up Darren Fletcher to equalize before Ruud van Nistelrooy headed home to send them down. In the other game, Crystal Palace traveled to local rivals Charlton Athletic and after Bryan Hughes gave them a half time lead, Dougie Freedman equalized within two minutes of coming on as a substitute before winning a penalty which top scorer Andy Johnson scored meaning the Eagles looked like staying up but Jerome Thomas's free kick was headed home by Jonathan Fortune, the game finished 2\u20132, relegating them. That meant West Brom became the first team to be bottom at Christmas and stay up, this resulted in the Baggies fans invading The Hawthorns pitch, Portsmouth fans joined in as their local rivals Southampton were relegated, Albion also stayed up with the lowest ever points tally in the Premier League for a surviving team with 34."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["Arsenal entered the Football League Cup in the third round, where they were drawn at home against West Bromwich Albion.
