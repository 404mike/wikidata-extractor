He was taught engraving by his father, as was his younger brother Jan Vandergucht (or John) (c.1699-c.1730). Gerard was also taught drawing by Louis Ch\u00e9ron, and studied at Godfrey Kneller's Great Queen Street Academy. He surpassed the restrained style of engraving favoured by his father, and became one of the leading engravers in London by adopting the French method of combining precise engraving with etched tones.In 1719, he was commissioned by James Thornhill to engrave four designs for the cupola of St Paul's Cathedral.  He took over his father's house - the Golden Head in Queen Street, Bloomsbury - following his father's death in 1725.  He married Mary Liney on 24 August 1725.  They had over 30 children, including the painter and picture dealer Benjamin Vandergucht.He became a leading publisher of engraved prints and book illustrations, and taught Robert White and Francis Patton. \nIn 1735, he took a leading role in the artists' demands for copyright protection which led to an extension of the provisions established by William Hogarth in the Engraving Copyright Act. The 1735 act only protected original designs. Vandergucht and his supporters successfully lobbied to extend copyright protection to cover all prints.He concentrated on art dealing in the last 16 years of his life, selling prints, drawings, paintings and statues.  He was a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce.  He moved to Vandyke's Head, Great Brook Street, in 1758, where he died in 1776.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Stukeley", "response": ["In August 1721, Stukeley and Roger Gale set forth on another tour, visiting Avebury and Stonehenge before going to Gloucester, Hereford, Ludlow, Wolverhampton, Derby, and finally reaching Grantham in October.

He returned to Avebury in the summer of 1722\u2014this time with the artists Gerard Vandergucht and John Pine, who had both become Roman Knights that year\u2014before proceeding to Stonehenge and Silchester. In September and October he embarked on another tour, this time taking in Cambridge, Boston, Lincoln, Dunstable, Leminster and Rochester, largely following Roman roads. He published a description of this tour as Iter Romanum. In 1723, he travelled from London to Newbury and Marlborough before visiting Stanton Drew stone circles, and then heading back east to Bath, Exeter and Dorchester.
