His thought both moved beyond and was critical of the modern tradition, whether rationalist or empiricist. His thought may be classified as personalist, as his writings focused primarily on the nature of human beings. He viewed persons in terms of their relationality and agency, rather than the modern tendency to characterize them in terms of individualism and cognition.\nHe made contributions in the fields of political science, religion, education, and philosophy in a long career of writing, teaching, and public speaking. After retirement he became a Quaker.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cogito, ergo sum", "response": ["=== John Macmurray ===", "The Scottish philosopher John Macmurray rejects the cogito outright in order to place action at the center of a philosophical system he entitles the Form of the Personal. \"We must reject this, both as standpoint and as method. If this be philosophy, then philosophy is a bubble floating in an atmosphere of unreality.\"Macmurray, John. 1991. The Self as Agent. Humanity Books. p. 78. The reliance on thought creates an irreconcilable dualism between thought and action in which the unity of experience is lost, thus dissolving the integrity of our selves, and destroying any connection with reality. In order to formulate a more adequate cogito, Macmurray proposes the substitution of \"I do\" for \"I think,\"  ultimately leading to a belief in God as an agent to whom all persons stand in relation."]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* John Macmurray (1891\u20131976)"]}, {"page": "Ernest Gellner", "response": ["He returned to Balliol College in 1945 to finish his degree, winning the John Locke prize and taking first class honours in 1947.
