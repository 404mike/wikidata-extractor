A favourite innovation was to project the main portico of a house deep enough to form a porte coch\u00e8re (i.e. a shelter for carriages )."]}, {"page": "Joseph Gwilt", "response": ["After a visit to Italy in 1816, he published in 1818 Notitia architectonica italiana, or Concise Notices of the Buildings and Architects of Italy.

In 1861 he designed a Venetian Gothic facade for a public house in Red Cross Street in the City of London, described by Wyatt Papworth as  \"probably the first attempt to render the mediaeval style appropriate for such a business\". In 1861 he rebuilt St Mary's Church, Ripple, Kent, on its original Norman foundations, in a Romanesque style, in imitation of St. Nicholas, Barfreston. He also restored Sutton Church, about a mile away, adding an apse, its windows once again copied from those at Barfreston.
