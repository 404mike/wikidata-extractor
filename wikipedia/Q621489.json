He was notable for his invention of the Ghost Count or Elmsley Count, creating mathematical card tricks, and for publishing on the mathematics of playing card shuffling.He began practising magic in 1946, as a teenager. He studied physics and mathematics at Cambridge University; whilst there he was also secretary of the Pentacle Club. He was a patent agent, and later a computer expert, in his day job. Otherwise, he was an amateur card and close-up magician. He was awarded an Academy of Magical Arts Creative Fellowship in 1972.He created a number of well-known magic tricks, including The Four Card Trick, Between Your Palms, Point Of Departure and Diamond Cut Diamond.In 1975 he briefly toured the US giving a highly praised lecture known as the \"Dazzle Card Act\", which consisted of a magic act followed by a detailed discussion of routining. Notes on the lecture were released under the title Cardwork. Elmsley was the subject of The Collected Works of Alex Elmsley (vol. 1 1991, vol. 2 1994).\nHe named the special count used in The Four Card Trick the ghost count, though it would later become known as the Elmsley Count.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of magic tricks", "response": ["Some students of magic strive to refer to effects using a proper name, and also to properly attribute an effect to its creator. For example, consider an effect in which a magician shows four aces, and then the aces turn face up one at a time in a mysterious fashion. This effect, recognized as Twisting the Aces, is attributed to Dai Vernon, and it is based on a false count invented by Alex Elmsley. Some tricks are listed merely with their marketed name (particularly those sold as stand-alone tricks by retail dealers), whereas others are listed by the name given within magic publications."]}, {"page": "Glossary of magic (illusion)", "response": ["*Elmsley count -  a false count (often done with four cards) where the face or back of a card is hidden while the cards are passed from one hand to another.
