She went on to feature in storylines about drugs, various family crises, relationships with Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), a feud with Steve's ex-wife Karen McDonald (Suranne Jones) and a short-lived marriage to Robert Preston (Julian Kay). Her exit storyline in 2007 was the culmination of a storyline that saw Tracy imprisoned for killing her boyfriend Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) in revenge. In the on-screen events, Tracy was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Her brief return in May 2010 saw the character lie about Gail Platt (Helen Worth) confessing to murdering late husband Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale). Her return in December 2010 saw her released from prison after forensic evidence used at her trial was discredited, and getting her daughter Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney) back and attempting to steal Steve from his wife Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly) and failing; resulting in them both having a feud.

The first actress to play Tracy was Christabel Finch in 1977, who first appeared in the role when she was 15 days old. According to Finch in 2007, \"It was a case of being the right baby, in the right place, at the right time. The casting director came to the baby unit and picked me at random, then asked my parents if I could be in the show.\" In 2001, Finch reflected on her time in the soap, remembering that she used to share a dressing room with Anne Kirkbride who played Tracy's mother Deirdre and one of her most prominent storyline memories is her involvement in Deirdre's affair with Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs): \"Because I was a kid, everyone was really friendly to me. Julie Goodyear, who played Bet Gilroy, was really lovely and a very down-to-earth person. The biggest plot I was involved in was when Deirdre had an affair with Mike Baldwin. There was a lot of shouting going on and Ken was screaming at her, 'Get out of the house!' I just thought, 'what's going on, why are they shouting?'\" Finch left the role when she was seven as her parents had opted to move to Guernsey. It was two years until the producers recast Tracy. On screen during that time, Tracy's parents Ken and Deirdre would say that Tracy was either in her room upstairs or at school. Eight-year-old Holly Chamarette was given the role in 1985. At the time she reportedly commented, \"I'm thrilled. I've been watching Coronation Street for ages.\" She was chosen from more than 60 children, but left the role when she was 11 in 1988, quitting the acting profession to become a doctor."]}, {"page": "Rovers Return Inn", "response": ["* 10 April 2005: Tracy Barlow's (Kate Ford) biological father Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) dies of stomach cancer during a party to celebrate the second wedding of his ex-wife Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride) to Ken Barlow (William Roache).", "Jack (Arthur Leslie) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) bought the tenancy and moved into The Rovers Return on 4 February 1937. During World War II, landlord Jack was away from the pub for some time on army duty, leaving Annie to run the pub by herself. The pair was considered very different. Jack, with a broad Northern accent (the phrase \"Eeee Annie\" heard on many occasion), was no different from his customers, whilst Annie was a snobbish, \"well spoken\" lady.  Despite this, the pair were inseparable until Jack's untimely death in 1970 while the couple were on holiday. (This was due to the sudden death of Arthur Leslie off-screen). Considered by many to be the best landlady of them all, Annie holds the reins at The Rovers for 46 years. Her sometimes vicious snobbishness often alienates her from her customers, but she runs the pub with class and stands for no nonsense.Little. (1993) p.19. Behind her mask of a hard landlady, Annie is a very vulnerable person. In 1975, she is held up in her bedroom by two young thieves. After she refuses to reveal where she keeps her money, they flee, receiving a beating in the yard courtesy of Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) and Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson). Though calm throughout, the ordeal causes Annie to collapse later. The brewery hears rumours that she is becoming an absentee landlady, something which she had always feared.Little. (1993) p.142. She does not like to feel detached from her duties, and is always free to speak to customers and develop friendships with her staff, in particular Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) and Betty Turpin (Betty Driver). She continues her tenancy until 1983 (on-screen), but in 1984 it is announced that Annie has decided to retire as landlady to spend more time with her daughter, Joan, and her family in Derby. In agreeing to pay off her son Billy Walker's (Ken Farrington) debts, he agrees to take over the tenancy as landlord. Sadly, Billy does not fully enjoy the role, and in December 1984, the brewery buy the tenancy back from the Walker family, ending over 47 and a half years of the Walker name over the door of The Rovers. In 2012, it is revealed that Annie left the tenancy and role of landlady to Betty in her will; however, Betty is not interested, and the letter and will are only found after Betty's death (and the tenancy had already been sold back to the brewery prior to Annie's death, rendering the bequest moot).", "In 2005, Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) returned to Coronation Street, where he died of stomach cancer.
