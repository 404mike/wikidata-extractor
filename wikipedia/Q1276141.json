He was Arsenal's top scorer in both 1966\u201367 and 1967\u201368, having started out as a centre forward for the club, but later moved back into midfield as an inside forward with John Radford moving from the wing to central striker."]}, {"page": "Norman Hunter (footballer)", "response": ["Hunter played three games for England under-23 before given his debut for the England team in 1965 by manager Alf Ramsey. On 8 December 1965, England played Spain in Madrid. Hunter came on in his first game, as a 35th minute substitute for Joe Baker. The substitution of Hunter in a midfield position allowed Ramsey to deploy both Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball in more attacking roles as England won 2\u20130. The existing partnership between Jack Charlton and Bobby Moore meant that he spent much of his international career as an understudy, winning 28 caps in total.

In only his second cap he came on as a substitute as England famously beat Germany 5\u20131 in the Olympiastadion.

Baker was almost killed, but Law's injuries were not life-threatening.", "Although his time in Italy was mixed, Law was voted number one foreign player in Italy ahead of teammate Joe Baker, Fiorentina winger Kurt Hamrin and Inter Milan midfielder Luis Suarez. The lifestyle and culture of a foreign country was an eye-opener for the young Scotsman, and the medical expertise and sports science in Italy was far ahead of what was available in the UK at the time.

During this time as a semi-professional he was working as a gardener, but Rovers chairman Tom Fagan demanded \u00a340,000 to sell Slaven, which was a high price for a non-professional third-tier player.
