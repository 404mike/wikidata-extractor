He also worked as assistant coach for head coach Ian Porterfield, along with Englishman Tom Jones, for the Armenia national football team. In September 2007, Porterfield died. Minasyan and Jones became the acting head coach and assistant coach, respectively, before the end of the year. In early 2008, the new head coach, Danish specialist Jan Poulsen, was invited and Minasyan went back to his position as assistant head coach. In March next year, Poulsen was fired because of poor results and Minasyan again temporarily (at the time) became the head coach.

Sunderland dominated the early stages of the game and within five minutes had missed two chances to take the lead.  After less than two minutes, Pascoe flicked on a pass from Reuben Agboola to send Eric Gates clear on the left side of the penalty area.  His floated cross into the middle was missed by  Gabbiadini.  Then, a header from John McPhail into the Swindon penalty area was cleared.   In the sixth minute, Swindon had the first of a series of chances through White: this one he struck wide of Norman's goal.  The next, a volley, was held onto by Norman while the third, a header from a Shearer pass, was deflected over the Sunderland crossbar.  On 18 minutes, White then ran onto a weak backpass from McPhail and pushed the ball past Norman.  His shot rolled along the goal line and struck the post, and the deflection was then struck by Shearer but Norman kept the ball out.  Tom Jones then took a shot which Norman blocked with his legs.  In the 25th minute, Foley crossed from the right and found Alan McLoughlin just outside the Sunderland box.  He struck the ball which took a large deflection off Gary Bennett's boot, changing both its pace and direction, and beat Tony Norman in the Sunderland goal.  McLoughlin had spent most of the season as the attacking midfielder in Swindon's diamond formation but had not scored for three months leading up to the final.  In the 40th minute, David Kerslake's pass to White found him unmarked in the penalty area but Norman recovered the ball.  Just before half time, Kerslake and Jones worked the ball to Steve Foley but he headed over the Sunderland crossbar.", "|CM ||7 ||Tom Jones"]}, {"page": "Tom Jones (footballer born 1964)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Jones (footballer, born 1964)"]}]}}
