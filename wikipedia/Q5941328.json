He was born at Bridgwater, Somerset and died at Barnstaple, Devon.\nBurrington played in first-class cricket as a lower-order batsman, though it is not known whether he batted right- or left-handed. He played in one game in 1903, two in 1904 and a further two in 1905, but had little success in any of them. His best performances, and the only times he reached double figures as a batsman, came in the game against Kent in 1904 when he made an unbeaten 18 in the first innings and followed that with 20 in the second.In the First World War, Burrington was commissioned as an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry; in 1916, he was temporarily promoted from second lieutenant to full lieutenant. He was further promoted to acting captain in 1917.
