His popularity gained as a CW columnist led to engagements as an after-dinner speaker at cycling events.Bell is also a serious reporter with a degree in politics who has reported on race riots, gangland contracts, drugs wars and environmental and social issues in his native Merseyside for The Independent and The Observer. Following a road accident in which several members of Rhyl cycling club were killed, Bell criticized the attitudes of those such as Jeremy Clarkson, whose column in The Sun he considered anti-cyclist, and what he saw as the cynical attitude of motorists. He called for a single organisation to represent cyclists in the UK to avoid such tragedies recurring.Bell was also professional cyclist. He once held the mountains and points jerseys in the prestigious Mi-Ao\u00fbt Bretonne. He is the brother of former National Amateur and Professional Road Race Champion Mark Bell, who died in 2009.\nBell lives in Chester and supplements his income as a bus driver.

There he could also report his other love: boxing. He died of a heart attack while cycling in Canada after retirement. Gayfer was succeeded by Ken Evans, whose interest in short-distance time-trialling led to a parallel competition to the British Best All-Rounder: the Campagnolo Trophy for races over 25 miles (40\u00a0km). It lasted only two seasons before it was considered not worth the effort and expense. Evans resigned to work with the components wholesaler, Ron Kitching.cited Breckon, Michael (1993), A Wheel in two Worlds, the Ron Kitching Story, p227 Evans was replaced by Martin Ayres. He in turn was followed by Andrew Sutcliffe, who had been editor of Cycle Trader. Under Sutcliffe the magazine took on a stronger pictorial content and reporting of domestic cycling, especially where it didn't concern racing, was lessened in favour of coverage of continental racing. Sutcliffe left to help form a company called Cabal Communications, run by other former IPC staff. Cabal introduced a monthly magazine called Procycling as a rival to IPC's own monthly publication, Cycle Sport. Its first editor was William Fotheringham, who had also been on IPC's staff. Sutcliffe's replacement was Robert Garbutt, who is the current editor. Significant members of staff have included Sid Saltmarsh \u2013 deputy editor under Alan Gayfer \u2013 who worked formerly for the News Chronicle and the BBC and who was reporting the Tour de France when the English rider Tom Simpson died during the race in 1967. Recent columnists have included Tony Bell, and Michael Hutchinson."]}, {"page": "Tony Bell (disambiguation)", "response": ["Tony Bell, Antony Bell or Anthony Bell may refer to:", "*Tony Bell (Antony Bell, born 1958), British journalist", "*Tony Bell (physicist) (Anthony Raymond Bell, fl. from 1977), British physicist", "*Anthony Bell (director) (also known as Tony Bell, born 1970), American animator, film director and screenwriter"]}]}}
