By the end of the decade, however, it was in decline.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), pp. 1354\u20135. The attendance at, and numbers of folk clubs began to decrease, probably as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 94. Although many acts like Martin Carthy and the Watersons continued to perform successfully, there were very few significant new acts pursuing traditional forms in the 1980s. This began to change with a new generation in the 1990s. The arrival and sometimes mainstream success of acts like Kate Rusby, Bellowhead, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Jim Moray, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Frank Turner, Laura Marling and Eliza Carthy, all largely concerned with acoustic performance of traditional material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of the tradition. This was reflected in the adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000, which gave the music a much needed status and focus and the profile of folk music is as high in England today as it has been for over thirty years.D. Else, J. Attwooll, C. Beech, L. Clapton, O. Berry, and F. Davenport, Great Britain (London, Lonely Planet, 2007), p. 75.", "Yorkshire has a rich heritage of folk music and folk dance including the Long Sword dance.C. J. Sharp, Sword Dances of Northern England Together with the Horn Dance of Abbots Bromley, (Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing, 2003). Folk songs were collected there from the 19th century but, though it probably had more attention than other northern counties, its rich heritage of industrial folk song was relatively neglected.C. J. D. Ingledew, Ballads and Songs of Yorkshire (London, 1860); C. Forshaw, Holyrod\u2019s Collection of Yorkshire Ballads (London, 1892). It was not until the second revival in the 1950s that Nigel and Mary Hudleston began to attempt to redress the balance, collecting Yorkshire songs between 1958 and 1978.N. Hudleston and M. Hudleston, Songs of the Ridings: The Yorkshire Musical Museum, ed., M. Gordon and R. Adams (Scarborough: G. A. Pindar and Son, 2001) and P. Davenport, ed., The South Riding Songbook: Songs from South Yorkshire and the North Midlands (South Riding Folk Network, 1998). Yorkshire folk song lacked the unique instrumental features of folk in areas like Northumbria and was chiefly distinguished by the use of dialect, particularly in the West Riding and exemplified by the song \u2018On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\u2019, probably written in the later 19th century and using a Kent folk tune (almost certainly borrowed via a Methodist hymnal), but often seen as an unofficial Yorkshire anthem.A. Kellett, On Ilkla Mooar baht 'at: the Story of the Song(Smith Settle, 1988). Most Yorkshire folk songs were not unique and tended to be adapted to fit local geography and dialect, as was the case with probably the most commercially successful Yorkshire song, \u2018Scarborough Fair\u2019, recorded by Simon & Garfunkel, which was a version of the Scottish ballad \u2018The Elfin Knight\u2019.F. J. Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads Dover Publications (New York, 1965), vol 1, p. 8.

Nidel, World Music: The Basics (London: Routledge, 2005), pp. 90\u20131.
