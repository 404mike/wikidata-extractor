Described as 'the best back in the Northern League', he was signed by newly promoted Football League First Division club Burnley in June 1898. At the start of the 1898\u201399 season, Barron was unable to displace David Beveridge from the right-half position. He made his debut for the club in the sixth match of the campaign, a 1\u20131 draw away at Sheffield United on 1 October 1898. Barron kept his place in the Burnley team for the remainder of the season, playing in 29 league matches and 2 FA Cup ties.Simpson (2007), p. 73 He retained his starting berth for the majority of the 1899\u20131900 season, making 30 league appearances, but was dropped for the final two matches of the campaign in favour of Bill Jenkinson.
