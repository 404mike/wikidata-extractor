Gurney is regarded as one of the great World War I poets, and like others of them, such as Edward Thomas, whom he admired, he often contrasted the horrors of the front line with the beauty and tranquillity of his native English landscape \u2013 these themes were explored in the 2012 musical play A Soldier and a Maker.", "Deliberately unrhetorical in his poetic tone,I.
