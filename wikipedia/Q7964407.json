In either case his defense was grounded very mainly on the Revelation. For he at once bases his justification on the fact, as demonstrable, of the Pope answering alike to the chief of the false Christs prophesied of by Christ, as to come in his name; to the Man of Sin prophesied of by St. Paul: the city of Papal Rome answering also similarly to the Apocalyptic Babylon.It is unclear, in the light of modern scholarship, whether Anthony Wood's identification of Brut with Walter Brit is sound.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pierce the Ploughman's Crede", "response": ["A second, related point of interest is that the Crede is a Lollard production that acknowledges the influence of Walter Map's Latin, anti-monastic \"Goliardic\" satires, such as \"The Apocalypse of Bishop Golias\" and \"The Confession of Golias.\" The author of the Crede claims that these works tarnished the monastic orders and brought on the mendicant orders, or else Satan himself founded them.

Lollardy was a political and religious movement that existed from the mid-14th century to the English Reformation. The term lollard refers to the followers of John Wycliffe,. a prominent theologian who was dismissed from the University of Oxford in 1381 for criticism of the Church, especially in his doctrine on the Eucharist. The Lollards' demands were primarily for reform of Western Christianity. Powys discusses the impact of John Wycliffe's ideas in his \"Argument\" to Owen Glendower.p. viii.
