A Descent of Memory. (New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2007), p. 263. On the libel case, see Krissdottir pp. 301\u2013302 and 304\u2013308. According to Powys, this novel's \"heroine is the Grail\",\"Preface\" to A Glastonbury Romance. London: Macdonald, 1955, p. xiii. and its central concern is with the various myths, legends and history associated with Glastonbury. Not only is A Glastonbury Romance concerned with the legend that Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail, a vessel containing the blood of Christ, to the town, but the further tradition that King Arthur was buried there.Krissdottir, p. 251. Furthermore one of the novel's main characters, the Welshman Owen Evans, introduces the idea that the Grail has a Welsh (Celtic), pagan, pre-Christian origin.See Ben Jones \"The 'mysterious word Esplumeoir' and Polyphonic Structure\" in A Glastonbury Romance in In the Spirit of Powys, p. 80. The main sources for Powys's ideas on mythology and the Grail legend are Sir John Rhys's Studies in the Arthurian Legend, R. S. Loomis's Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance, and the works of Jessie Weston, including From Ritual to Romance.Morine Krissdottir, Descent of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys. London: Overlook Press, 2007, pp. 252\u2013253. T. S. Eliot's The Wasteland is another possible influence.See Krissdottir, p. 255. A central aspect of A Glastonbury Romance is the attempt by John Geard, an ex-minister now the Mayor of Glastonbury, to restore Glastonbury to its medieval glory as a place of religious pilgrimage.Krissdottir, p. 252. On the other hand, the Glastonbury industrialist Philip Crow, along with John and Mary Crow and Tom Barter, who are, like him, from Norfolk, view the myths and legends of the town with contempt.See Cavaliero, pp. 61\u201362. Philip's vision is of a future with more mines and more factories. John Crow, however, as he is penniless, takes on the task of organising a pageant for Geard. At the same time an alliance of Anarchists, Marxists, and Jacobins try to turn Glastonbury into a commune."]}, {"page": "A Glastonbury Romance", "response": ["In 1934, Powys and his English publishers were successfully sued for libel by Gerard Hodgkinson, real-life owner of the Wookey Hole caves, who claimed that the character of Philip Crow had been based on him.

Later, while studying at the University of Oxford, Goodliffe made a single first-class appearance for Oxford University Cricket Club against Somerset at University Parks in 1904. During this match, he was dismissed for a duck by Talbot Lewis in Oxford University's first-innings.  He took two wickets during the match, those of George Barne in Somerset's first-innings, and Gerard Hodgkinson in their second-innings, with Oxford University winning by an innings and 45 runs.
