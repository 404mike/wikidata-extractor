They signed the band and paired them with producer Ian Stanley (formerly of Tears for Fears). EastWest financed expensive music videos and heavily promoted their releases. The first release was on Boxing Day 1994 and was the single \"Tell Me When\", which gave the band their first Top 10 hit since 1986's \"Human\".

Around this time they met local musician Ian Stanley, who offered them free use of his home 8-track studio. Stanley began working with the duo as their keyboard-player and, after recording two demos, Tears for Fears were signed to Phonogram Records in the UK in 1981 by A&R manager Dave Bates. Their first single, \"Suffer the Children\", produced by David Lord, was released on that label in November 1981, followed by the first edition of \"Pale Shelter\" (produced by Mike Howlett) in March 1982, but neither releases were successful.", "The band achieved their first taste of success with their third single, \"Mad World\", which reached No. 3 in the UK in November 1982.

The album was written largely by Orzabal along with keyboardist Nicky Holland, who had toured with the band on their \"Big Chair\" world tour in 1985. Moving from various studios and using various sets of producers over many months, the band ultimately decided to scrap the recordings and take the reins themselves with assistance from engineer Dave Bascombe. Much of the material was recorded in jam sessions and later edited down. The length of the production impacted on the band's management company, who had financially over-extended themselves in other business matters and were hoping for an earlier release date to pay off their debts.", "*Ian Stanley \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals (1981\u20131987)", "  bar:Ian    text:Ian Stanley"]}, {"page": "The Beautiful South", "response": ["The final Beautiful South album Superbi was released on 15 May 2006.

Hughes and longtime TFF keyboardist Ian Stanley both left the project later in 1987 citing \"creative differences\", though their contributions to the track remained on the final album. After two failed attempts to make the album, the band opted to produce it themselves, assisted by engineer Dave Bascombe. Also in 1987, Orzabal and Smith flew over to the US to track down a hotel lounge pianist/vocalist named Oleta Adams, whom they had seen playing in Kansas City during their 1985 American tour. Hoping she could add to the organic feel by bringing a soulful warmth to their music, they invited Adams to work with them on their new album.
