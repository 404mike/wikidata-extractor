He spent his winters as a sweep, but being a capable cricketer spent the summers as a professional cricketer. His first recorded cricket match was with the Northwood Club, West Cowes, Isle of Wight in 1880.\nIn 1881 Porter was living at Chapel Street, Spondon, Derbyshire and was with the South Derbyshire Club. Also in the 1881 season he played one match for Derbyshire against Lancashire in which he took a wicket in the first innings, but did not play for the club again until the 1888 season. In the interim he played for Birkenhead Park in 1882, for Wigan in 1883 and 1884, for Lowerhouse in 1885, for Grimsby in 1886 and for Longsight, Manchester from 1887 to 1889. In 1888 he played three games for Derbyshire who were by then outside the County Championship, and one game in the 1889 season. From the 1890 season he played regularly for Derbyshire and from 1890 to 1892 for Broughton, Salford.In the 1894 season, Derbyshire matches again qualified as first-class, and Porter took 5\u201314 against Leicestershire. In the 1895 season the club competed in the County Championship and Porter had six 5 wicket innings. Against Hampshire he achieved 7\u201352 in the first innings and 7\u201349 in the second inning in an innings victory. He took 5\u201367 against Leicestershire, 5\u201380 against Essex, 5\u201355 against Lancashire and 5\u201367 against Surrey. He also achieved a top score of 93 against Nottinghamshire after being moved up the batting order in a follow-on for a drawn match. Derbyshire ended the season fifth in the points table. In the 1896 season Porter took 5\u201350 against MCC, but during the season he had to undergo surgery after straining himself, bringing his first-class career to an end.Porter was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and took 130 first-class wickets at an average of 21.50 and a best performance of 7 for 49. He was a right-hand batsman and played 56 innings in 37 first-class matches with a top score of 93 and an average of 9.41.Porter played for Lowerhouse again in 1897. He was then an umpire in first-class matches between 1899 and 1903.\nPorter died at Spondon, Derbyshire at the age of 45.\nPorter married Elizabeth Ann Mayne who was born at West Cowes, Isle of Wight in 1880.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spondon", "response": ["*George Porter, cricketer."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Although the county then had a quite strong team due to the bowling of George Davidson, Joseph Hulme and George Porter and the batting and wicket-keeping of William Storer, William Chatterton and Bagshaw, within three years they had hit rock-bottom, going through 1897 without a win due to their best bowlers losing their powers."]}, {"page": "George Porter (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Porter (1920\u20132002) was a British chemist and Nobel prize winner", "George Porter may also refer to:", "*George Porter (architect) (died 1856), British architect", "*Sir George Porter, 1st Baronet (1822\u20131895), British surgeon, see Porter baronets", "*George Porter (cricketer) (1861\u20131908), English cricketer", "*George Porter (politician) (1884\u20131973), British Labour MP for Leeds Central, 1945\u20131955", "*George Porter Jr. (born 1947), American musician", "*George Porter (footballer) (born 1992), English professional footballer", "*George Porter (athlete) (born 1966), American athlete", "*George Porter (rugby union) (born 1989), English rugby union player", "*George Porter (Royalist) (1622\u20131683), royalist army officer of the First English Civil War", "*George Porter (conspirator) (1659\u20131728), English soldier and conspirator", "*George Porter (Upper Canada), early settler in Upper Canada, said to have constructed the first house in York, expanded into Berkeley House, York, Upper Canada ", "*George Porter (mariner) (1786\u20131872), mariner and early pioneer of South Australia"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1881", "response": ["The captain for the year was Robert Smith in his fifth year as captain.
