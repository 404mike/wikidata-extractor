He was an employee of the Hobart newspaper The Mercury, Melbourne's The Argus and The Herald, and London's Daily Mail; from 1931 until his death, he headed the film criticism division of The Daily Telegraph. In 1950, he served as president of the Critics' Circle.\nDixon's plays formed the basis for the scripts of the films Isle of Escape (1930), directed by Howard Bretherton; Secret Agent (1936), directed by Alfred Hitchcock; and, according to one version, the film Freedom Radio (1941) by Anthony Asquith.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laurence Olivier", "response": ["In January 1947 Olivier began working on his second film as a director, Hamlet (1948), in which he also took the lead role. The original play was heavily cut to focus on the relationships, rather than the political intrigue. The film became a critical and commercial success in Britain and abroad, although Lejeune, in The Observer, considered it \"less effective than [Olivier's] stage work.\u00a0... He speaks the lines nobly, and with the caress of one who loves them, but he nullifies his own thesis by never, for a moment, leaving the impression of a man who cannot make up his own mind; here, you feel rather, is an actor-producer-director who, in every circumstance, knows exactly what he wants, and gets it\". Campbell Dixon, the critic for The Daily Telegraph thought the film \"brilliant\u00a0... one of the masterpieces of the stage has been made into one of the greatest of films.\" Hamlet became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Olivier won the Award for Best Actor."]}, {"page": "Secret Agent (1936 film)", "response": ["Secret Agent is a 1936 British espionage thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, adapted from the play by Campbell Dixon, which in turn is loosely based on two stories in the 1927 collection Ashenden: Or the British Agent by W. Somerset Maugham. The film stars Madeleine Carroll, Peter Lorre, John Gielgud, and Robert Young. It also features uncredited appearances by Michael Redgrave, future star of Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (1938) and Michael Rennie in his film debut."]}, {"page": "Quatermass 2", "response": ["Quatermass 2 received mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph found the film \u201call good grisly fun, if this is the sort of thing you enjoy\u201d. The reviewer in The Times remarked that \u201cthe writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally\u201d. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: \u201cScience-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II  fails on all these scores, I am afraid\u201d. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt \u201cThe whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: \u201cHow am I going to make a report on all this?\u201d I felt the same way\u201d."]}, {"page": "Michael Medwin", "response": ["He made many film appearances, taking a leading role as Ginger Edwards in the 1953 Guy Hamilton film The Intruder, for which one critic wrote that Medwin \"gives a brilliant study of a good fellow gone wrong.\"Campbell Dixon, The Daily Telegraph, 17 October 1953, quoted on the programme note for 'Projecting the Archive - The Intruder', BFI Documentation Unit, 2012."]}, {"page": "The Intruder (1953 film)", "response": ["A contemporary critic commented that the film treated the subject \"with intelligence, taste, and a feeling for the medium\"; he also wrote \"Medwin... gives a brilliant study of a good fellow gone wrong\".Campbell Dixon, The Daily Telegraph, 17 October 1953, quoted in BFI programme note, 2012."]}, {"page": "Women of Twilight", "response": ["Daily Telegraph, January 1953: \"I missed Women of Twilight as a play because I chose to; I saw the film because I must. This study of the conditions in which unmarried mothers live and have their children, and not uncommonly watch them die, is powerful, sordid, disturbing and perhaps not so overdrawn as some good easy people think. If it helps to awaken the public conscience and sharpen official vigilance it will be justified.\"Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph, 19 January 1953"]}, {"page": "Patrick Gibbs", "response": ["After the end of the war Gibbs invested in a chain of laundrettes, but his career shifted after a friend introduced him to actress Muriel Pavlow. He and Pavlow became lifelong friends, and Pavlow in turn introduced him to dramatic critic of The Daily Telegraph, W A Darlington. Darlington invited Gibbs to review some minor works for the paper as a stringer. During this period, the Telegraph's film critic, George Campbell Dixon, was frequently ill and Gibbs often picked up his work. In 1960, Dixon left the post and Gibbs took over his duties. He was an observant critic, but sometimes irked readers with his detailed summary of a film's plot. He had little time for celebrity or the Hollywood system and his reviews were independent and tended to concentrate on acting and production."]}, {"page": "George William Campbell Dixon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Campbell Dixon"]}, {"page": "George Campbell Dixon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Campbell Dixon"]}, {"page": "Len Reynolds (illustrator)", "response": ["Reynolds attended Hobart Technical College (now known as TasTAFE) in 1909\u201312, 1914, and 1918, and he exhibited with the Art Society of Tasmania from 1918\u201319.
