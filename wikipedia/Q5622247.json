The pilot was broadcast in 2008. When Andrea Riseborough announced that she wouldn't be available for an upcoming series of Being Human, the producers had to do a recasting. This way also the dynamic of the main characters would change, which made the production crew rethink their previous casting choices. Creator Toby Whithouse later said that the pilot vampires were a \u201cbit to Anne Rice\u201d for his liking. So it was decided to change the actors of the pilot's vampires, including Mitchell. Actor Gregg Chillin read for Mitchell but was later cast as Owen. When Aidan Turner got a call from his agent about auditioning for a new drama Being Human, Turner's initial reaction was to turn the offer down. He didn't know what to make of the show's concept, which sounded bizarre to him. As soon as he got the script, Turners opinion of the show changed. He auditioned for the role and got it a few time later. The changing of the actor of Mitchell changed not only the personality of Mitchell, but also of the characters around him.
