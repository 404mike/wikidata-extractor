He participated in two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 18 July 1959.  He scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races.\nHis racing career effectively ended when his steering column weld failed on his Lotus 18 in the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix at 160 mph (260 km/h). He was thrown from the car, cutting down a tree with his body and broke several bones (Alan Stacey and Chris Bristow were killed and Stirling Moss was also injured at the event, crashing his Lotus 18 in practice). He was paralysed, but after therapy was able to regain the ability to walk.Because of his car failure Taylor later sued Lotus successfully, one of the few successful actions against the makers of a racing car.After his accident, Taylor sporadically competed in long distance rallying, finishing third in the London\u2013Sydney Marathon in 1977 in a Citro\u00ebn CX with Paddy Hopkirk and Bob Riley. Taylor also had a career in property speculation. He died on 4 April 2017 after a battle with cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1960 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Mike Taylor", "The Belgian Grand Prix of 1960 was one of the most disastrous races in Formula 1 history with the weekend claiming two drivers and two others suffering serious injuries in practice. This race, which took place at the second-fastest and perhaps the most dangerous circuit of the year, the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in the southern part of Belgium saw two big accidents on Friday with Moss suffering an axle failure at the super-fast Burnenville corner and being thrown from the car in the ensuing crash. He broke both his legs. Formula 1 debutante Mike Taylor suffered a steering failure in his Lotus at the Holowell corner and crashed into trees beside the track suffering multiple injuries which ended his career. Jack Brabham took pole position for Cooper, two and a half seconds faster than the older BRP-run Cooper of Tony Brooks with Phil Hill's Ferrari sharing the front row. Behind them were the BRP Cooper of local hero Olivier Gendebien and Graham Hill's BRM. Come race day, Brabham took the lead at the start, and he would lead from start to finish. Gendebien made a good start to be second but then faded, while Team Lotus's Innes Ireland moved up into second place, although he would disappear soon afterwards with clutch trouble. On lap 20, British BRP Cooper driver Chris Bristow, who was fighting for sixth with the Ferrari of Willy Mairesse, lost control at Malmedy and crashed. He was thrown from the car, landed in some barbed-wire fencing, and was decapitated. Within five laps, Briton Alan Stacey of Team Lotus was also dead, having been hit in the face by a bird near the Masta kink. He crashed, his car was launched off an embankment and it landed in a field some 25 feet lower than the track and burst into flames, with Stacey still in the car, where he burned to death. Brabham won the race while Bruce McLaren in the second works Cooper emerged to finish second, giving the company a 1\u20132 finish with Graham Hill third but celebrations were muted. It would remain the blackest weekend in World Championship history until the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.", "|align=\"left\"|  Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "1959 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Mike Taylor", "|align=\"left\"|  Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "1959 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|  Mike Taylor Jonathan Sieff"]}, {"page": "1958 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|  Innes Ireland Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "Lotus 18", "response": ["| Mike Taylor", "| Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "Mike Taylor", "response": ["Mike Taylor may refer to:", "* Mike Taylor (musician) (1938\u20131969), British jazz pianist and songwriter", "* Mike Taylor (guitarist) (1948\u20132010), American songwriter and archaeologist", "* Mike Taylor (racing driver) (1934\u20132017), Formula One driver", "* Mike Taylor (cricketer, born 1942), English cricketer", "* Mike Taylor (cricketer, born 1944), English cricketer", "* Mike Taylor (offensive tackle) (born 1945), American football offensive tackle", "* Mike Taylor (linebacker, born 1949), American football linebacker", "* Mike Taylor (linebacker, born 1989), Wisconsin Badgers linebacker", "* Mike Taylor (basketball coach) (born 1972), American basketball coach", "* Mike Taylor (basketball) (born 1986), American basketball guard", "* Mike Taylor (swimmer) (born 1964), British multiple sclerosis activist", "* Mike Taylor (Montana politician) (born 1941), American politician", "* Mike Taylor (public servant), Australian"]}, {"page": "Lotus Grand Prix results", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left\"|  Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "Mike Taylor (auto racing)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Taylor (racing driver)"]}, {"page": "Mike Taylor (driver)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Taylor (racing driver)"]}, {"page": "1974 London\u2013Sahara\u2013Munich World Cup Rally", "response": ["The majority of the competition did not complete the southernmost leg of the rally, south of the Tamanrasset rally point.

However, the combination of a Grand Prix engine with the innovative Lotus transaxle generally did not provide a high level of reliability, so the 15 was never crowned with a major endurance title despite the impressive level of speed.

Most entries were redesigned Formula Ford 2000 cars. The cars used a Talbot Sunbeam 1.6 litre engine that ran on methanol fuel. The series folded in 1982 after three seasons. Pat Symonds designed the Formula Talbot, Formula Ford 1600 and Formula Ford 2000 cars built by Royale in 1980. The marque dominated the British Formula Ford 2000 championship. Royale RP27's won all races in the BARC championship. Richard Trott won the championship. Trott also won the MCD Formula Ford 2000 championship. In Formula Ford 1600 Royale won three races in the BARC championship with Jonathan Palmer, Rob Tennant and Rick Morris. The following year was less successful for Royale. The RP29 and RP30 were race winners in their championships but could not secure championship titles. In Formula Ford 1600 David Wheeler was the most successful Royale driver winning two races in a Van Diemen dominated season. Van Diemen also dominated the Formula Ford 2000 championship. Royale achieved five wins with Tim Davies and two wins with Mike Taylor. In 1982 Mike Taylor entered a Royale S2000M, Royales first Sports 2000 car, in the British Sports 2000 Championship. The British driver won three races. Jeremy Rossiter and David Sutherland also won races in the championship driving Royales. The Thundersports championship was launched in 1983. Royale S2000M cars were eligible in this Formula Libre style sports car championship. Royale achieved three podium finishes. The S2000M also won races in the British S2000 championship with David Sutherland. Keith Fine won the only race for Royale in the British Formula Ford 1600. Bob Marston designed a new S2000 car for 1984. The car achieved a second place at Brands Hatch in the Thundersports championship. In the British S2000 championship James Thompson won four races. Thompson secured the championship finishing in front of Sean Walker both driving Royales. 1984 was also the year the last Formula Ford 1600 chassis were built by Royale. The Royale RP36, of which 14 were built, could not achieve significant results. The following year the last Formula Ford 2000 chassis were built. But with Reynard and Van Diemen dominating the market, Royale could not win any races. In S2000 Royale had stiff competition from Shrike and Tiga. Ian Flux won round 14 at Thruxton. Bob Marston designed a new S2000 car, the RP42. Mike Taylor finished second in the championship winning six races. Taylor went on to win the following season in a RP42. The British driver also scored podium finishes in the Thundersports championship in 1986 and 1987. Royale made its first Group C car in 1985. The Royale RP40 would be rebadged as the Argo JM16 after Royale ceased to produce racing cars. The car would achieve a ninth place in its inaugural race, the 1984 24 Hours of Daytona.  Lyn St. James and Howdy Holmes achieved a third-place finish in the Watkins Glen 500 Kilometres."]}, {"page": "1958 RAC Tourist Trophy", "response": ["|  Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "1959 1000km N\u00fcrburgring", "response": ["|  Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "1959 RAC Tourist Trophy", "response": ["|  Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "1960 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring", "response": ["|  Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2017", "response": ["*Mike Taylor, 82, British racing driver, cancer.NOTICE OF DEATH \u2013 MICHAEL J C TAYLOR (1934\u20132017)"]}, {"page": "1959 BRDC International Trophy", "response": ["| Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "1959 BARC Aintree 200", "response": ["| Mike Taylor"]}]}}
