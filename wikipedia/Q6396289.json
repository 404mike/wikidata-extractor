The Dubs bounced back to close the gap to 1-6 to 1-9 by the interval as Kevin Flynn got onto a long ball and flashed it past the unsighted Brian Murray for his goal. Dublin were still very much in the hunt at 1-13 to 1-16, thanks to points from the excellent Liam Ryan and David Curtin, when Begley decided the tie with a crisply-hit shot at the death to secure a 2-16 to 1-13 victory."]}]}}
