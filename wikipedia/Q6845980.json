With him due to be released by Reading, Smith signed for York on 26 May 2001 on a two-year contract. He made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute for Matt Hocking in a 3\u20132 home defeat against Exeter City on 6 October 2001. Smith made his first start for York in the following match, a 3\u20130 defeat away to Hartlepool United on 13 October 2001, Dolan describing his performance \"as the one bright spot\" from the match. However, following York's 4\u20131 away defeat by Kidderminster Harriers on 23 October 2001, Dolan placed the blame on the team's inexperienced defence. He did not feature in the team again until being recalled for an FA Cup first round 0\u20130 draw away to Colchester United on 17 November 2001. According to the Evening Press, Smith gave a \"near-faultless display\" when York beat his former club Reading 2\u20130 at home in the FA Cup second round on 8 December 2001. He was forced to miss the Christmas period with a virus, which resulted in him losing his place in the team, with Mike Basham, Gary Hobson and Hocking forming solid partnership. After being sent off for the first time in his career in a 3\u20130 defeat away to Rushden & Diamonds on 19 January 2002, he received a one-match suspension. Smith was substituted at half-time in York's 1\u20131 away draw with Halifax Town on 12 February 2002 due to a tight hamstring, returning over two months later in a 3\u20130 home victory over Bristol Rovers on 16 April. Having failed to establish himself as a first-team regular, Smith finished 2001\u201302 with 19 appearances for York."]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Mike Basham", "|Mike Basham"]}, {"page": "2000 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Peterborough United's opposition for their play-off semi-final were Barnet with the first match of the two-legged tie being played at Underhill Stadium in Chipping Barnet on 13 May 2000.
