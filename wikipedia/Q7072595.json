British journalist Tim Moore criticised the length of its tracks as excessive, and called the album \"persistently tuneless, repetitive and garbled\". It was identified by BBC Radio presenter OJ Borg as the record he regrets buying. In 2017, Vices Daisy Jones ranked 15 \"one-hit wonder\" albums from history, naming The Boy with the X-Ray Eyes as the worst. Jones had praise only for the chorus of \"Spaceman\", likening the remainder of the record to \"being thumped on the head with a large chunk of wood then dragged backwards through thick sludge\"."]}, {"page": "Oj borg", "response": ["#REDIRECT OJ Borg "]}]}}
