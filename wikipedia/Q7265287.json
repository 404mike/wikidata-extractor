The group changed its name as it changed the outward appearance of its sound, from pop to dub-influenced chill-out. The underlying melodies and the familiar voices of Bailey and Currie still gave a Thompson Twins tone. However, the addition of Quest vocalist Amey St. Cyr (\"Take Me Away\" and \"Tribe\"), emcee Q-Tee (\"Beautiful\"), deep basslines, and loads of spacious effects made it a much more relevant album for the lounge music scene. Promotion of the album was minimal.  However, during an interview in Classic Pop magazine in 2014, Bailey stated the album was influential in the recording of Original Soundtracks 1, an album released in 1995 by U2 and Brian Eno under the pseudonym Passengers."]}, {"page": "Tatiana Mais", "response": ["#REDIRECT Q-Tee"]}, {"page": "Horny (Mark Morrison song)", "response": ["\"Horny\" is a song by British R&B musician Mark Morrison.
