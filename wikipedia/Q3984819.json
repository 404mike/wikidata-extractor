With retirements to Brett Emerton in January and Terry McFlynn, and the contract expirations of marquee player Alessandro Del Piero, foreign player Ranko Despotovi\u0107 and former Socceroo Richard Garcia, there was a lot of experience to be filled by the club. Arnold announced his first signing on 12 May 2014, acquiring the services of his former Mariner winger Bernie Ibini-Isei. Sydney FC then announced signings of prolific A-League goalscorer Shane Smeltz and Socceroo Alex Brosque. After months of searching Arnold found his new marquee man in Austria national football team captain Marc Janko. On 8 October 2014, Brosque was announced as captain for the 2014\u201315 A-League season, alongside vice-captains Sasa Ognenovski and Nikola Petkovi\u0107. Sydney FC's season began with the highly anticipated match-up against the newly re-branded Melbourne City FC and guest superstar David Villa. Whilst not starting the game, Villa came on early in the second half to claim the equalising goal, the result ending 1\u20131. Sydney FC continued on an eight-game undefeated streak that ended when Perth Glory FC came from behind to score two goals in the final seven minutes to claim victory at Allianz Stadium. The following week saw another thrilling Big Blue in Melbourne ending 3\u20133. Sydney FC struggled for form as they moved closer to the January break for the AFC Asian Cup, not scoring in four consecutive matches. During this break, Sydney FC were able to bolster their stocks, signing Senegalese internationals Micka\u00ebl Tavares and Jacques Faty as injury replacement players. Upon resumption, Sydney FC posted 19 (out of a possible 21) points in the next seven rounds. Whilst slipping up twice at home to Melbourne City and Adelaide United FC (with scores of 0\u20131 in both games) during the final six rounds, Sydney FC managed to win all four other games away from home to finish second on the ladder with 50 points for the season. By the end of the regular season, Sydney FC had broken many records including a record club home season attendance (41,213 vs. Western Sydney Wanderers FC) and a league record number of away games undefeated in a season, as well as becoming the first club to score three or more goals in five consecutive games. Marquee Marc Janko also set his own A-League record for most consecutive goalscoring appearances with seven. After having the first week of the finals off, Sydney FC met Adelaide in the semi-finals at home. A brace from Alex Brosque set Sydney up for a 4\u20131 win. Ultimately, Sydney FC were outplayed in the 2015 A-League Grand Final, defeated by Melbourne Victory FC 3\u20130 at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium.", "| Terry McFlynn", "| Terry McFlynn || Foundation player, captain (2010\u20132013), all-time leading appearances (214) across 9 seasons (2005\u20132014)", "| Terry McFlynn"]}, {"page": "Perth Glory FC", "response": ["| Terry McFlynn"]}, {"page": "Magherafelt", "response": ["* Terry McFlynn (born 1981) \u2013 a current football player for Sydney FC and former Northern Ireland Under 21 player"]}, {"page": "Swatragh", "response": ["* Terry McFlynn - professional association football player"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 A-League", "response": ["|  Terry McFlynn", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Terry McFlynn||Sydney FC||7||0||0"]}, {"page": "Ufuk Talay", "response": ["His first season was cut short by a knee injury, missing the last seven games (including the grand final) after solid performances in the A-League and Club World Cup.
