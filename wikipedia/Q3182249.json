There is a further possibility that Rossier visited Shanghai in order to procure photographic chemicals (Bennett). If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand.Bennett; Thiriez. Papillon produced images taken between Canton and the Taku Forts but became ill and was evacuated before completing his mission. Photographs of the expedition by Fauchery have not been positively identified, but probably include twenty-four stereographs of the French forces in Canton, Shanghai, Tientsin and Peking. No evidence has been found that either Du Pin or Legrand actually took photographs during the expedition. Thiriez, 6\u20137. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer."]}, {"page": "Papillon (name)", "response": ["*John Papillon (cricketer) (1806\u20131889), English cricketer", "*John Papillon (1838\u20131891), British photographer and army engineer"]}, {"page": "Papillon, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Papillon"]}]}}
