Boorman commissioned David Munrow, director of the Early Music Consort, to write the score. While the film is set in the distant future (the 23rd century approximately), Boorman seemed to believe futuristic music would contain a variety of old-world instruments. Boorman instructed Munrow to use a variety of medieval instruments including notch flutes, medieval bells and gemshorns. These instruments, plus snatches of Beethoven's Seventh, gave the movie a truly unusual soundtrack. As stated by British conductor Sir Anthony Lewis in 1976 \"David Munrow did not just emerge into the field of medieval and renaissance music......he exploded into it. He established a standard that can now never be ignored, and the stimulating shock-waves from his explosion will carry far into the future...\"", "Along with David Munrow's medieval ensemble, the Zardoz soundtrack features Beethoven's \"Symphony No.7\" in A, 2nd movement, played by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Conducted by Eugen Jochum."]}, {"page": "1969 in music", "response": ["*Anthems in Eden \u2013 Shirley and Dolly Collins with the Early Music Consort of London directed by David Munrow"]}, {"page": "1976 in music", "response": ["*May 15 \u2013 David Munrow, early music performer, 33 (suicide)"]}, {"page": "19th Annual Grammy Awards", "response": ["**David Munrow (conductor) & the Early Music Consort of London for The Art of Courtly Love"]}, {"page": "Shawm", "response": ["* Instruments of the Middle Ages and Renaissance\u2014David Munrow and The Early Music Consort of London"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 3", "response": ["Pied Piper was a children's programme, presented by early music specialist, David Munrow, with the sub-title Tales and Music for Younger Listeners and ran from August 1971 until 1976.

The unusual combination of ancient instruments included rebecs, sackbuts, viols and crumhorns. Some find it hard to imagine that electric accompaniment for traditional song, as successfully purveyed by Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, could have developed quite as it did without the pioneering Anthems in Eden.
