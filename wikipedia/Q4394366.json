Feinberg's anti-war activism led to his speeches being heckled; receiving death threats on his phone and in the mail; and for a popular pamphlet, The Red Rabbi, accusing him of being a Communist being published. In January 1967, he visited Hanoi to meet Ho Chi Minh as part of a peace mission to protest the Vietnam war. Ho disliked meeting Westerners and it was most unusual that Feinberg was allowed to meet him. Feinberg called Ho this \"paragon of durability impervious to events\", who spoke to him in French and told him he was convinced that North Vietnam would win.  Feinberg spent 10 days in Hanoi with a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend A. J. Muste, and the South African Anglican bishop, Ambrose Reeves. In a joint statement, the three clergymen condemned Operation Rolling Thunder, the American strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam as both ineffective and a war crime. The statement claimed that the North Vietnamese people \"could not be terrorized\" into submission and predicted that Rolling Thunder was destined to fail. The statement accused President Lyndon Johnson of violating both the United Nations charter and the Geneva Accords."]}]}}
