When he gave the tune to his father, Evan James was able to compose the words which are the present-day Welsh national anthem.

The memorials in the park include the War Memorial and the Evan and James James statues, as well as some smaller ones. A cricket ground, Ynysangharad Park, is located within the park. There is also a lido that was reopened on 31 August 2015 after it received funding, after being closed for two decades.", "==Evan James and James James memorial==", "In the park there is memorial to Evan James and his son James James who wrote Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, the Welsh National Anthem. Evan James and his son James were weavers who lived in Pontypridd when they composed the National Anthem in 1856, James wrote the words while Evan composed the music. Although originally called Glan Rhondda (Banks of the Rhondda) it was quickly renamed Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of My Fathers) when it gained huge popularity after being performed at the 1858 Llangollen National Eisteddfod. Unlike many anthems it was not written to represent a particular occasion in history, but by 1905 was largely accepted as the National Anthem by the Welsh population simply because of how popular it had become. This means that even though Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is accepted as the Welsh National Anthem, it is neither officially or legally recognised as it in British Law, since legally the National Anthem of Wales is God Bless the Prince of Wales. Following James James' death in 1902 many local residents felt that a memorial should be erected to both Evan and James James to remember the authors of the National Anthem and started a campaign to have one built. However the Senghenydd mining disaster in 1913 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 stopped the campaign. Then in 1929 Rhys Morgan put an advert in the Western Mail appealing for money to have a memorial built, stating that he expected a \"prompt response\" from every \"Welsh man or woman\", the money was quickly raised. The memorial that you see in the park today was designed by Sir William Goscombe John and unveiled by Lord Treowen on 23 July 1930 before a crowd of 10,000 people. The monument consists of two life size bronze figures, one woman who represents poetry and a male harpist who represents music. There is an inscription under the memorial that reads:", ":In memory of Evan James and James James, father and son of Pontypridd, who inspired by a deep and tender love of their native land united poetry to song and gave Wales her National Anthem, Hen Wlad fy Nhdau."]}]}}
