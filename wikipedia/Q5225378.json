Speroni continued to be the club's first choice goalkeeper despite facing competition from Darryl Flahavan. At the start of the 2008\u201309 season, he continued to stand out as Crystal Palace's key players despite the club's poor start. He helped Crystal Palace keep three consecutive clean sheets between 30 September 2008 and 18 October 2008. Speroni started in every match until he missed one match, due to a leg injury sustained during a 2\u20130 win against Coventry City on 8 November 2008. Despite missing one match and facing risk over his return from a leg injury, Speroni returned to the starting line\u2013up from injury against Bristol City on 22 November 2008 and helped the club win 4\u20132.} Since his return from injury, he helped Crystal Palace go on an eight match unbeaten run between 22 November 2008 and 26 December 2008. Speroni continued to regain his first team place as the club's first choice goalkeeper for the rest of the 2008\u201309 season. During a 1\u20130 loss against Southampton on 13 April 2009, he suffered a gash on his face in the 80th minute of the match that required him stitches and had Clint Hill stand by in goal for the rest of the match, with all three substitutes were used. But Speroni quickly recovered from injury, returning to the starting line\u2013up against Derby County on 18 April 2009 and helped Crystal Palace keep a clean sheet, in a 1\u20130 win. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he went on to make forty\u2013eight appearances in all competitions. For the second time in a row, Speroni was named the club's \"Player of the Year\" award."]}, {"page": "Tesfaye Bramble", "response": ["During his time at Southend United, Bramble was forced to play in goal against Boston United when goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan was sent off for handball outside the area.

The struggling Championship side booked their place in the Fifth Round thanks to a 30-yard free-kick from Freddy Eastwood in the 27th minute. United tried to respond, but Cristiano Ronaldo was denied by two saves from Darryl Flahavan. David Jones' drive then crashed against the post before John O'Shea saw Flahavan tip over his cross-shot. Southend clung on for a shock win."]}]}}
