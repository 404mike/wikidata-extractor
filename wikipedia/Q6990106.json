This opportunity to confront the Prime Minister proved irresistible to the suffragettes who organised a campaign over several days to coincide with his visit. Maud Joachim and Douglas Smith were the  speakers at this protest. On the night before Asquith's visit the suffragettes Charlotte Marsh, Laura Ainsworth, Evelyn Wurrie (real name Evelyn Wharrie) and Nellie Hall gained access to the grounds, where they hid in a plantation of trees near to the marquee where Asquith was due to speak. On his arrival the four women rushed forward with megaphones shouting phrases such as \"When are you going to give justice to women?\" while Nellie Hall managed to chain herself to a tree. At the same time Douglas Smith, who was outside, climbed over a wall and made for the marquee before being chased by 12 men and caught.Colin Cartwright, Burning to Get the Vote: The Women's Suffrage Movement in Central Buckinghamshire 1904-1914, The University of Buckingham Press (2013) - Google Books"]}, {"page": "Nell Hall-Humpherson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nellie Hall"]}]}}
