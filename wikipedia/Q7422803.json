She was a Quaker turned Congregationalist. Her numerous books are mostly about women's roles in society. She argued that women had a religious duty as daughters, wives and mothers to provide an influence for good that would improve society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of feminism", "response": [" The Victorian ideal created a dichotomy of \"separate spheres\" for men and women that was very clearly defined in theory, though not always in reality. In this ideology, men were to occupy the public sphere (the space of wage labor and politics) and women the private sphere (the space of home and children.) This \"feminine ideal\", also called \"The Cult of Domesticity\", was typified in Victorian conduct books such as Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management and Sarah Stickney Ellis's books. The Angel in the House (1854) and El \u00e1ngel del hogar, bestsellers by Coventry Patmore and Maria del Pilar Sinu\u00e9s de Marco, came to symbolize the Victorian feminine ideal. Queen Victoria herself disparaged the concept of feminism, which she described in private letters as the \"mad, wicked folly of 'Woman's Rights'\"."]}, {"page": "Ellis", "response": ["* Sarah Stickney Ellis (1799\u20131872), English writer"]}, {"page": "The woman question", "response": ["*Sarah Stickney Ellis (1839).

The next owner, Henry Ricardo, commissioned architects Ernest George and Harold Peto to design a north wing to the house, at right angles to the original block, which was completed in 1879. In 1898 the house became St Monica's Priory, run by nuns of the Order of St Augustine. At this point 'the best C17 fittings were taken out' including 'fireplaces now at Rothamsted Manor'.Nikolaus Pevsner (revised Bridget Cherry), The Buildings of England. Hertfordshire, Yale University Press, 2002, p. 207. After the priory relocated itself nearby in 1969, the empty building was eventually converted into offices. Nikolaus Pevsner states that this occurred in 1974-5 when it was converted by Rialto Builders."]}, {"page": "Sara Ellis", "response": ["* Sarah Stickney Ellis (1799\u20131872), English writer on women's roles in society"]}, {"page": "The New World (newspaper)", "response": ["*Sarah Stickney Ellis' complete novel, Summer and Winter in the Pyrenees."]}]}}
