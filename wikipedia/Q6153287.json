He often threatens to \"tell mum\" when Wilson will not let him get his own way, and tries to frighten Mainwaring by setting his mother on him. Mavis can be quite formidable when she wants to be: in the episode \"The Making of Private Pike\", Mainwaring threatens to arrest Frank and his mother vows to Wilson that she would make his life a misery for the rest of his days if he lets Mainwaring take Frank away. Mrs Pike's occupation (if any) is unknown, but she often volunteers her services to the Home Guard.
