He made fundamental contributions to matrix theory, invariant theory, number theory, partition theory, and combinatorics.  He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the Johns Hopkins University and as founder of the American Journal of Mathematics.  At his death, he was a professor at Oxford University.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linear algebra", "response": ["In 1844 Hermann Grassmann published his \"Theory of Extension\" which included foundational new topics of what is today called linear algebra.

To implement his plan, Gilman recruited internationally known researchers including the mathematician James Joseph Sylvester; the biologist H. Newell Martin; the physicist Henry A.

Eugenio Beltrami and Camille Jordan discovered independently, in 1873 and 1874 respectively, that the singular values of the bilinear forms, represented as a matrix, form a complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions. James Joseph Sylvester also arrived at the singular value decomposition for real square matrices in 1889, apparently independently of both Beltrami and Jordan. Sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix A. The fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is Autonne in 1915, who arrived at it via the polar decomposition. The first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by Carl Eckart and Gale J. Young in 1936; they saw it as a generalization of the principal axis transformation for Hermitian matrices."]}, {"page": "Trinity College Dublin", "response": ["* James Joseph Sylvester"]}, {"page": "Altitude (triangle)", "response": ["The first of the previous vector identities is also known as the problem of Sylvester, proposed by James Joseph Sylvester.D\u00f6rrie, Heinrich, \"100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics.
