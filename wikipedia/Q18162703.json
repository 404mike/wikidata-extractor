In 1806 he unsuccessfully sought election to Parliament from Fowey, a rotten borough in nearby Cornwall, along with Admiral Alexander Cochrane. In 1808 he achieved election from another rotten borough, Grampound, with the support of Grampound patron Christopher Hawkins, but was unseated two months later after a petition by the other candidates, two more Cochranes (George Cochrane and Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone), financed by a fourth brother, the nabob Basil Cochrane. Teed ultimately deserted the Hawkins interest and was elected anew in 1812 with Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone, serving until 1818.\nTeed was a reliable supporter of the Tory government of the Earl of Liverpool until 1817; after his defeat in the 1818 election in Grampound he helped expose corruption in the elections there, testifying against Manasseh Masseh Lopes. The revelations led to the suppression of the Grampound constituency in 1821.", "link_mentions": {}}}
