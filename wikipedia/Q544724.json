In doing so, his expedition charted previously unexplored areas along the northern Canadian coastline, including Baffin Bay, Smith Sound and Lancaster Sound.\nHe was also the inventor of the marine hydraulic steering gear and the anchor design that bears his name. HMS Inglefield bears his name, as do the Inglefield Land region and the Inglefield Gulf of Greenland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 27", "response": ["*1820 \u2013 Edward Augustus Inglefield, English admiral and explorer (d. 1894)"]}, {"page": "William Baffin", "response": ["Baffin again sailed as pilot of Discovery the next year. Leaving Gravesend on 26 March, he passed west of Greenland up the Davis Strait, discovering the large bay to its north which now bears his name, together with a series of sounds which radiate from its head and were named by him after members of the North-West Passage Company: Lancaster, Smith, and Jones. On this voyage, he sailed over  farther north than his predecessor John Davis: since his voyages seemed to preclude hope of an ice-free nautical path to the Orient, the area was not explored again for two centuries and his furthest north (about  remained unsurpassed in North America until the Royal Navy officer Edward Augustus Inglefield reached  in the same area in 1852."]}]}}
