In October 1915, possibly to escape the increasingly turbulent atmosphere in the Stiffkey rectory, he joined the Royal Navy as a chaplain. He began his service on HMS Gibraltar, a depot ship based in the Shetland Islands, where he irritated his shipmates by calling church parades every time another ship visited the anchorage; he had the full approval of the base commander, Vice Admiral Sir Reginald Tupper, who was known as \"Holy Reggie\".Cullen, pp. 45\u201346 Davidson's service report from Gibraltars captain records that \"he performs his duties in a perfunctory manner. Not on good terms with messmates, disregards mess rules and regulations\".Tucker, pp. 15\u201316 In October 1916 Davidson joined HMS Fox in the Middle East, and shortly afterwards was arrested by the naval police during a raid on a Cairo brothel. He explained that he was looking for a diseased prostitute who had been infecting his men. Again his commanding officer's reports were negative; however, Davidson remained with the Fox until August 1918 when he was posted to HMS Leviathan in the northern Atlantic. Here, his commander was slightly more complimentary; he found Davidson \"a clever writer and entertainer [who] pays attention to duty\". Davidson left the Navy in March 1919."]}, {"page": "Northern Patrol", "response": ["Admiral De Chair was replaced early in 1916 by Rear-Admiral (later Vice-Admiral) Reginald Tupper.
