Bidmead played only three first-team games in three seasons, and moved on to Leyton in the 1906 close season. Two years later he returned to the Football League with Grimsby Town, but played only once before returning to Brierley Hill Alliance where he finished his career in 1911.Bidmead died in Bethnal Green, London, in 1961 at the age of 78.", "link_mentions": {}}}
