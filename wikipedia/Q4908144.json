He played for Elwells, Walsall (though not in the Football League), Stourbridge and Brierley Hill Alliance before joining Small Heath in September 1903 as cover at full back for Jack Glover and Frank Stokes. Matthews describes Glover and Stokes as \"generally rated as the best at club level anywhere in the country around the turn of the century\". Bidmead played only three first-team games in three seasons, and moved on to Leyton in the 1906 close season. Two years later he returned to the Football League with Grimsby Town, but played only once before returning to Brierley Hill Alliance where he finished his career in 1911.Bidmead died in Bethnal Green, London, in 1961 at the age of 78.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Bidmead", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Bidmead"]}, {"page": "Alfred Sellman", "response": ["He and Birmingham team-mate Bill Bidmead signed for Leyton, newly promoted to the Southern League First Division for the 1906\u201307 season.

There were no takers, and in late 1908, after some time away from the game, he returned to local football in his home county with Walsall League club Rugeley: on his debut, the Lichfield Mercury reported that \"the man most anxiously watched was the new centre-half, Sellman, an old first division player, and it is not going too far to say he justified expectations. He is a little stiff after his long rest, but he showed some good football, and is very useful with his head.\""]}, {"page": "Bidmead", "response": ["* Bill Bidmead (1882\u20131961), English footballer"]}]}}
