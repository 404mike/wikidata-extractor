The club's financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 2003\u201304, although they remained in the play-off places in December 2003. However, a hairline fracture to Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid-table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup though with a 4\u20131 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton."]}, {"page": "Mike Pejic", "response": ["Pejic married in December 1970 and again in April 1991.

His return came as a 90th-minute substitute in a 0\u20130 away draw with Ebbsfleet United on 8 March 2009. During the period of his injury, York signed defender Shaun Pejic, whose form alongside Daniel Parslow in central defence resulted in McGurk being unable to reaffirm his place in the team. He started in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 9 May 2009, which York lost 2\u20130 to Stevenage Borough.

He was looking a bit 'leggy', he's finding full-time football a bit different, but he'll learn from this.\" In spite of that setback, Evans made a seamless transition from the largely semi-professional Welsh Premier League to the fully professional League Two, making 40 league and cup appearances for Wrexham in the 2006\u201307 season, which was interrupted by a five-match ban during March 2007 for having been sent off three times in the season, and 32 league and cup appearances in the 2007\u201308 season. Following Wrexham's relegation to the Football Conference at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, he was out of contract and was considering his options. He signed a new one-year deal with Wrexham in June 2008, with an option for a further twelve months.

A new record for the most consecutive penalties scored in a shoot-out was set, at 25.
