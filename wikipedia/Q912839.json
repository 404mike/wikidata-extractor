He completed the Mass in A-flat major, (D. 678) in 1822, and later that year embarked suddenly on a work which more decisively than almost any other in those years showed his maturing personal vision, the Symphony in B minor, known as the Unfinished Symphony (D. 759).Newbould (1999), p. 182 The reason he left it unfinished \u2013 after writing two movements and sketches some way into a third \u2013 continues to be discussed and written about, and it is also remarkable that he did not mention it to any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving.Newbould (1999), pp. 182\u2013183 In 1823, Schubert wrote his first large-scale song cycle, Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin (D. 795), setting poems by Wilhelm M\u00fcller.Newbould (1999), p. 215 This series, together with the later cycle Winterreise (D. 911, also setting texts of M\u00fcller in 1827) is widely considered one of the pinnacles of Lieder. He also composed the song Du bist die Ruh' (You are rest and peace,Reed (1997), pp. 208\u2013209 D. 776) during this year.

He also made orchestral versions of piano works such as Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata, Weber's Invitation to the Dance, and Bizet's Variations chromatiques.  Before Brian Newbould's more recent work, in 1934, he made a performing version of Schubert's Symphony No. 7 in E major, D. 729,  that has received some performances and recordings; he also arranged works by a number of early Romantic masters for orchestral performance."]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)", "response": ["For a long time, the symphony was believed to be a work of Schubert's last year, 1828.

Now it is known that the 'Great' was largely composed in sketch in the summer of 1825: that, indeed it was the work to which Schubert was referring in a letter of March 1824 when he said he was preparing himself to write 'a grand symphony' (originally listed as Gmunden-Gastein symphony, D 849 in the Deutsch Catalogue). By the spring or summer of 1826 it was completely scored, and in October, Schubert, who was quite unable to pay for a performance, sent it to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde with a dedication. In response they made him a small payment, arranged for the copying of the orchestral parts, and at some point in the latter half of 1827 gave the work an unofficial perfunctory play-through (the exact date and the conductor are unknown) \u2013 though it was set aside as too long and difficult for the amateur orchestra of the conservatory.Newbould, p. 214.", "* Brian Newbould, Schubert and the Symphony.

One possible reason for Schubert's leaving the symphony incomplete is the predominance of the same meter (triple meter). The first movement is in , the second in  and the third (an incomplete scherzo) again in . Three consecutive movements in basically the same meter rarely occur in symphonies, sonatas, or chamber works of the most important Viennese composers.", "The Schubert scholar Brian Newbould, who harmonized, orchestrated and conjecturally completed the piano sketch of the scherzo, believed this to be true; but not all scholars agree. Pages appear to have been torn out after the beginning of the scherzo in the full score sent to H\u00fcttenbrenner, in any event. That H\u00fcttenbrenner neither had the work performed, nor even let the society know he had the manuscript, is curious and has spawned various theories.", "More recently, British musicologists Gerald Abraham and Brian Newbould have also offered completions of the symphony (scherzo and finale) using Schubert's scherzo sketch and the extended B minor entr'acte from his incidental music to the play Rosamunde Schubert wrote a few months later, long suspected by some musicologists as originally intended as the Unfinisheds finale. (In fact, it was even played as the finale as long ago as the British premiere of the symphony on 6 April 1867.) Its first movement, the scherzo sketch and the entr'acte are all in B minor, their instrumentation is the same, and the entr'acte (like the first movement) is in sonata form (as are all Schubert's symphonic finales) and in a very similar style and mood. If the entr'acte indeed started life as the finale of this symphony, then Schubert evidently recycled it (probably at that stage unorchestrated) from the symphony to the incidental music, presumably orchestrating it for the play and perhaps making compositional changes."]}, {"page": "Unfinished symphony", "response": ["*Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 7, which only contains a completed first movement and a single instrument part for the remaining symphony.
