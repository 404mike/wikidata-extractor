As George's wife, she was also Electress of Hanover until becoming Queen of Hanover on 12 October 1814, when the electorate became a kingdom.\nCharlotte was born into the royal family of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a duchy in northern Germany. In 1760 the young and unmarried George III succeeded to the British throne. As Charlotte was a minor German princess with no interest in politics, George considered her a suitable consort, and they married in 1761. The marriage lasted 57 years and produced 15 children, 13 of whom survived to adulthood. They included two future British monarchs, George IV and William IV; as well as Charlotte, Princess Royal, who became Queen of W\u00fcrttemberg; Prince Edward, the father of Queen Victoria; and Prince Ernest Augustus, who became King of Hanover.\nCharlotte was a patron of the arts and an amateur botanist who helped expand Kew Gardens. She was distressed by her husband's bouts of physical and mental illness, which became permanent in later life. She maintained a close relationship with Queen Marie Antoinette of France, and the French Revolution likely enhanced the emotional strain felt by Charlotte. Her eldest son, George, was appointed as Prince Regent in 1811 due to the increasing severity of the King's illness. Charlotte died in 1818. Her husband, who was unaware of her death, died a little over a year later.", "link_mentions": {}}}
