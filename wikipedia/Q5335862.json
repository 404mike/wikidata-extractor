He went on to become manager of Huddersfield Town.Boot was born in Laughton Common, near Rotherham. He played non-league football for Aughton and Denaby United before joining Sheffield United in 1934. He played 41 matches for the club in the Second Division, then in 1937 signed for First Division club Huddersfield Town. He appeared in the 1938 FA Cup Final, captained the side in the post-war period, and played 305 games for Huddersfield, all in the First Division, before retiring as a player in 1952. He then joined the coaching staff at the club, and in 1959 was appointed manager, a post which he held for four years. Boot died in 1999.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["Born and raised in Wolverhampton, Rudge became a lifelong fan of Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, he turned professional at Second Division club Huddersfield Town in November 1961. He made his debut under manager Eddie Boot in the 1962\u201363 campaign, and was given the residence of the recently departed Denis Law. He did not feature in 1963\u201364, appeared just twice in 1964\u201365, and did not get a game in 1965\u201366. He played two games at the start of the 1966\u201367 season, before manager Tom Johnston allowed him a move to Second Division rivals Carlisle United in December 1966."]}, {"page": "Bill McGarry", "response": ["\"Terriers\" manager George Stephenson bought McGarry to play in a defensive partnership with Laurie Kelly. He built a reputation as a tough-tackling, sturdy wing-half, and featured ten times towards the end of the 1950\u201351 season. He then scored twice in 43 games in 1951\u201352, as Huddersfield suffered relegation. New boss Andy Beattie led the club to immediate promotion out of the Second Division with a second-place finish in 1952\u201353. McGarry played all 44 games, in an extremely settled defence that featured himself, Kelly, Don McEvoy, Len Quested, Ron Staniforth, and goalkeeper Jack Wheeler; remarkably, the six men played every minute of the campaign, and had the best defensive record in the Football League with just 33 goals conceded in 42 league games. Town's solid defence then helped them to finish third in the top-flight in 1953\u201354, just six points behind champions Wolverhampton Wanderers; McGarry was again an ever-present, scoring four goals in 43 appearances. He then scored once in 38 games in 1954\u201355, as Town posted a 12th-place finish. He then scored four goals in 41 games in 1955\u201356, as their once solid defence leaked goals and cost them relegation as they finished below 20th place Aston Villa on goal average. Bill Shankly took charge at Leeds Road in November 1956, and took the club to 12th in the Second Division in 1956\u201357; he kept faith with McGarry, who scored twice in 36 appearances. He scored six goals in 36 games in 1957\u201358, as Huddersfield rose slightly to ninth place. His goal tally included a successfully converted penalty in the 7\u20136 defeat to Charlton Athletic at The Valley on 21 December; ten-man Charlton came back from 5\u20131 down in what The Guardian described as \"the most remarkable comeback in football history\". They then dropped down to 14th in 1958\u201359, with McGarry scoring four goals in 32 games. He scored once in 38 games in 1959\u201360; Town posted a sixth-place finish under new boss Eddie Boot, who took charge after Shankly left the club to manage Liverpool. McGarry scored once in 20 appearances in 1960\u201361, as Town dropped down to 20th place."]}, {"page": "Bobby Barclay", "response": ["In March 1937 Barclay was transferred to Huddersfield Town along with Eddie Boot for a combined fee of \u00a37,000.  He was a regular for Town in the following seasons and once again found himself on the losing side at Wembley as Huddersfield were beaten 1\u20130 by Preston North End in the 1938 FA Cup Final.  With the outbreak of World War II the football league was suspended but Town retained Barclay's registration throughout. As was common in this period Barclay made wartime guest appearances for Barnsley, Bradford Park Avenue, Bradford City, York City, Crewe Alexandra, Oldham Athletic and back at his old club Sheffield United.  With the war over Barclay was finally released by Huddersfield in 1946 having scored 19 goals from 74 league appearances."]}, {"page": "1938 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Three of the players who participated in the final (Andy Beattie & Bill Shankly of Preston and Eddie Boot of Huddersfield) would all manage Huddersfield within 20 years of this final.", "| ||6 || Eddie Boot"]}, {"page": "Denaby United F.C.", "response": ["*  Eddie Boot"]}, {"page": "Kevin McHale (footballer)", "response": ["The following season, despite the loss of Law and the club only just avoiding relegation, McHale continued to flourish. By the time he hit his mid twenties he had already made over 300 appearances for Town and scored over 50 goals. During the early 1960s, manager Eddie Boot came and went as Town pushed for a return to the top flight and when Tom Johnston took the helm in 1965, McHale would enjoy just one more full season. In 1965\u201366 he was virtually ever present as Town narrowly missed out on promotion, finishing fourth in Division Two. He scored eight goals, but Johnston perceived lack of promotion as a failure and began to restructure the team."]}]}}
