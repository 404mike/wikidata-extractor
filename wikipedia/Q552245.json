Burial was produced from 2001 to 2006 using the program Soundforge. Bevan began sending Steve Goodman (a.k.a.

When they look just skeletal as fuck in front of me, and so I know they\u2019ll sound good.\" He also said that he didn't use a sequencer, because if his drums were timed too perfectly, they would \"lose something\" and \"sound rubbish\". The drums were a major focus of his while making the record, saying that, \"I don\u2019t find melodies catchy, I find drums catchy. When you have a bassline in your head for a day, you\u2019re fucked. You can\u2019t think.\" He also recorded himself drumming in case he forgot a beat he thought of, as he would often get kicked out of class for drumming on tables. He went as so far as to call musicianship an \"enemy of my tunes\". Burial claimed he went for a sad feel with the album because it's what the old records he listened had: \"once you\u2019ve got a vocal sample over sub and drums, you don\u2019t have much choice with the rest of the elements.

Pitchfork Media critic Tim Finney noted the beats to be reminiscent of the playfulness of 2-step, except that the rhythms sound more nervous than joyful, and have a fast-running insubstantiality that brings to mind the fear and dread of dubstep. Lugubrious synths are played over these beats, which Finney said pass \"over one another like successive waves of blue and purple rainclouds.\" He also noted this raincloud effect to be similar to techstep made by artists of Parasol Records sub-label Hidden Agenda or producer Dom & Roland in the late 1990s. Crackles of pirate radio and vinyl, as well as actual recordings of rain and fire, which Burial opined \"would put most electronica producers to shame they\u2019re so fucking heavy\", are present on the album, as well as vocal samples that have been described as yearning and ghostly.", "According to journalist Derek Walmsley, \"a melancholy tinge runs through the album, but the constant interplay of tension and calm, and of alienation and intimacy, offers the possibility of salvation around the next corner.\"Derek Walmsley, \"Dubstep\", The Wire Primers: A Guide to Modern Music, ed. Rob Young, London: Verso, 2009, p. 92. Simon Reynolds' review in The Observer shared a similar sentiment, \"There's a simmering, suppressed violence bubbling inside Burial's music which conjures images of a city full of damaged people ready to inflict damage on others. But there's also a hovering grace and tenderness that makes me think of Wim Wenders's film Wings of Desire \u2013 a quality that emerges most clearly on 'Forgive', a beatless ache of sound threaded with the sounds of cleansing rainfall.\" Reynolds categorized Burial as a concept album and also said it \"could almost be an audio essay about the London hardcore continuum\",Reynolds, 2012. p. 515. as it follows South London flooded New Orleans-style due to global warming. He notes this situation similar to the novel The Drowned World by J.G. Ballard, a science fiction author who is a common reference point in discussions regarding dubstep. He said that the setting of the LP is localized using titles like \"South London Boroughs\" and \"Southern Comfort\", which are two tracks where their \"rippling canopies of amorphous sorrow-sound do for SE19 what Gas's K\u00f6nigsforst did for the woodlands near Cologne.\"", "Burial was released on the Hyperdub label in May 2006.

I love this film called Nil By Mouth by Gary Oldman because it\u2019s the only film I\u2019ve ever seen anyone get London properly in it, which is just distant lights, down the end of your road.

Simon Pitchforth of Resident Advisor called it one of the year's best albums and \"a classic of sustained urban atmospherics.\" AllMusic journalist Jason Birchmeier labeled Burial as the \"first great dubstep album\", writing that while other dubstep producers have built a dark and emotive style similar to Burial's, he was the first to do it on a full-length LP so effectively.", "Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Nick Butler described Burial as \"an experience that's probably quite unlike anything you've ever had\" and felt that the album, while not the year's best, \"was definitely top 10.\" Todd Burns of Stylus Magazine called it an \"occasionally great and always thrilling album\", even out of the dubstep scene. Tim Finney of Pitchfork felt that the album's ability to spin familiar music samples \"into webs of torturous beauty\" makes it a compelling listen, but also described it as \"a brilliant EP padded out with sketches and noble failures\", criticizing its inconsistency. In a less enthusiastic review, Robert Christgau gave it as a one-star honorable mention rating, writing that \"Maybe [Burial] figured get your beats working first and later for humanism--or maybe he still had a ways to go in the humanity department\", while citing \"Southern Comfort\" and \"Broken Home\" as highlights.", "Burial appeared on numerous year-end lists in 2006, including being named \"Record of the Year\" by The Wire magazine in its annual critics' poll.

In the absence of a session vocalist, Burial had friends sing over the phone and used samples of a cappellas, editing individual words to form sentences.

In contrast to Burial's past work, however, the tracks on Untrue more prominently feature pitch-shifted and time-stretched vocals, mainly sourced from manipulated samples of R&B tracks. Throughout the album's run time, the use of beats is varied; tracks such as \"Archangel\" and \"Near Dark\" feature uptempo, skittering beats, while tracks such as the beatless interludes \"Endorphin\" and \"In McDonalds\" place emphasis on isolated vocal samples overlaid on ambience.", "The mix of vocals and skipped drum patterns on Untrue has been likened to 2-step garage and early jungle music. Dan Hancox of The Guardian wrote that while the album is \"still distinctly DIY, some of the melancholy of Burial's debut has dissipated on [Untrue], which is more heavily loaded with garage-inflected vocals, and more upbeat as a consequence.\" Dave Stelfox of The Village Voice expressed a similar sentiment, noting a \"shift from dystopian melancholy to restrained optimism.\" Critics have noted that the increased emphasis on vocal effects on Untrue over his previous works contributes to its more emotional nature. Pitchfork critic Philip Sherburne wrote that Untrue is \"not a pop album, at least not by Top 40 standards, but his voices\u2014male, female, and ambiguous\u2014wriggle deep into the listener's consciousness.\" Burial uses pitch-shifting to make male vocals sound feminine and female vocals sound masculine, resulting in the album's vocals taking on a more androgynous nature. Sherburne stated that \"they toy with r&b's conventions, heavy with breath and rippling with trills and melisma, some of it digitally imposed.\"", "References to angels and supernatural phenomena recur in several of the album's vocal samples and track titles, including \"Archangel\" and \"Ghost Hardware\", and Burial has stated that these were intended to connect to people \"maybe taking a battering in their life, but [who] still handle themselves with grace\". He added: \"When you think of some of the things people go through, everyday troubles, relationship things, other stuff. Everyone knows those sorts of feelings. I wanted to do songs about that low-key stuff.\"", "On 17 October 2007, Scottish musician and Hyperdub label owner Kode9 appeared as a guest on the BBC programme Radio 1's Experimental Show, where he played several tracks from Untrue. Following much anticipation, Untrue was released by Hyperdub on 5 November 2007. It was released as thirteen-track Digipak CD and a nine-track double vinyl LP on which some beatless pieces were edited out. Untrue debuted at number 121 on the UK Albums Chart for the week ending 17 November 2007. In the Belgian region of Flanders, Untrue spent one week at number 57 on the Ultratop 50 albums chart. On the Ultratop Alternative Albums chart, it debuted at number 23 and remained on the chart for eight weeks. Hyperdub issued \"Archangel\" as the album's first single, and it peaked at number 21 on the Flanders Ultratip singles chart. \"Ghost Hardware\", which had previously been released on the Burial EP of the same name in June 2007, was made available for free download in the United Kingdom as the iTunes Store single of the week on 10 December 2007.", "Untrue was widely acclaimed by contemporary critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album has received an average score of 90, based on 23 reviews. Chris Mann of Resident Advisor wrote that Untrue \"lays another strong claim to Burial being the most innovative and expressive artist not only in dubstep, but in the whole of electronic music.\" Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic praised Untrue as being \"arguably even better than its predecessor\" and called it an album \"where the music... takes center stage with no distractions or sideshows, where there's never the urge to skip to the next track, because they're all part and parcel of the greater whole.\" Writing for The Guardian, Dorian Lynskey stated that \"Untrue confirms that Burial possesses not just the keen ear of a Lee Perry or Martin Hannett [...] but a capacious heart,\" calling the album \"as addictive as its predecessor.\" For MSN Music, Robert Christgau described the album as \"emotional, which helps its funk a lot, and eventful, which helps its interest even more\", comparing Burial's \"sonic imagination\" to that of English musician Tricky.", "Tom King of Drowned in Sound branded Untrue as an improvement over Burial's debut, writing: \"What gives this album more depth is the focus, the rolling symmetry and cinema.\" Joe Gross of Spin wrote that with the album, Burial \"deepens and expands his emotional range\". PopMatters critic Tal Rosenberg felt that the \"seamlessness\" of Untrue distinguished it from his past work and advised listeners not to approach the album \"as a dubstep record, but as a record, period.\" Dave Hughes from Slant Magazine deemed Untrue \"ambient music concealing its cracked modern heart with a stiff upper lip\", recommending it should be listened to at a high volume. In Pitchfork, Philip Sherburne praised Burial's use of vocal samples and wrote that the album managed to retain the style and overall vibe of Burial and improve over it, describing it as a \"deeper album\u2014richer, more complex, more enveloping.\" Uncut published a more lukewarm review of Untrue, characterising it as \"altogether warmer than its predecessor.\"", "Untrue appeared on numerous publications' year-end and decade-end top albums lists. Based on aggregated review scores, Untrue is ranked the most acclaimed album of 2007\u2014tied with The Field's From Here We Go Sublime\u2014by Metacritic. Resident Advisor and Sputnikmusic named it the best album of the year, while it was ranked the year's second best album by Fact and The Wire. Untrue also placed within the top ten of year-end best album lists by The Observer and Pitchfork, as well as at number 27 on The Village Voices year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll. In his Pazz & Jop ballot, poll creator Robert Christgau ranked it the tenth best album of the year. The album was nominated for a Mercury Prize in 2008, losing to Elbow's The Seldom Seen Kid. It was also nominated for the 2007 Shortlist Music Prize, which was eventually awarded to Feist's The Reminder. Untrue experienced a 1004% sales increase in the week following the Mercury Prize awards ceremony, allowing it to re-enter the UK Albums Chart and reach a new peak of number 58. The critical and commercial success of Untrue prompted Burial, whose identity until then had been anonymous, to disclose his real name\u2014William Bevan\u2014and give out interviews to the media.", "Fact named Untrue the best album of the 2000s and stated that Burial \"stripped UK garage of its twitchy micro-textures and created a fabulous new strain of future soul.\" Resident Advisor listed it as the third best album of the decade, with reviewer Derek Miller calling it \"a mastery of sample stitching\". Several other publications, including Pitchfork, Slant Magazine, and Stylus Magazine, included Untrue in their decade-end lists of best albums. NPR named the album one of the 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade, while The A.V. Club put it on its list of the best electronic albums of the decade. Rolling Stone placed Untrue at number eleven on their list of the greatest EDM albums of all time, while Q listed it as one of three essential dubstep releases. In 2017, critic Simon Reynolds, writing in Pitchfork, assessed Untrue as the \"most important electronic album of the century so far\", citing its impact on the British dance scene \"in the form of a self-conscious turn towards emotionality: not the primary-color, explosive emotions of old skool rave, but subtle shades of introspective melancholy\". In 2019, the album was ranked 31st on The Guardians 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list.", "All tracks written and produced by Burial.", "Category:Burial (musician) albums"]}, {"page": "Worldwide Winners", "response": ["*3.
