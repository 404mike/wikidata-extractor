Cochrane immediately froze construction on the canal, and ordered new accounting for all of the ministry's ongoing work across the country. W.A.

He estimated traffic would be limited to pleasure boats and barges carrying wood to the factories, but the locks and bridges would have to be manned at an annual cost of $4,000, and another $4,000 to run the pumping system that had been introduced to keep the canal full. Although most of the work was complete, he estimated that they could save $393,000 if it was abandoned."]}, {"page": "Bulldog Drummond at Bay (1937 film)", "response": ["* Frank Cochrane as Dr. Belfrus"]}, {"page": "The Tenth Man (1936 film)", "response": ["* Frank Cochrane - Bennett\t"]}, {"page": "Warning to Wantons", "response": ["* Frank Cochrane as Gaston"]}, {"page": "Chu Chin Chow (1934 film)", "response": ["* Frank Cochrane -  Mustafa "]}, {"page": "The Yellow Mask", "response": ["*Frank Cochrane as Ah-Song"]}, {"page": "McGlusky the Sea Rover", "response": ["* Frank Cochrane - Abu"]}, {"page": "Brigadier Gerard (film)", "response": ["* Frank Cochrane - Pierre "]}, {"page": "George Delancey Harris", "response": ["* George D.
