In his songs, Delibes shares with Bizet \"a natural feeling for the theatre, and an ability to spin local colour\", as in his chanson espagnole \"Les filles de Cadix\". Of other early songs, Johnson describes \"Eclogue\" and \"Bonjour, Suzon\" as \"charm[ing] us with their unpretentious gaiety and delicacy, as well as their economy of means\". Some of the songs evoke the period style of the 16th century, such as \"Avril\", \"Chanson de l'oiseleur\" and \"Myrto\", the last of which is a pre-echo of m\u00e9lodies by Gabriel Faur\u00e9. Johnson finds Delibes more suited to reflective than to passionate sentiments, and, in general, better in more of his earlier songs than his later.

The degree of intimacy \"seldom equaled in other kinds of music\" requires that the two performers \"communicate to the audience the most subtle and evanescent emotions as expressed in the poem and music\".  The two performers must agree on all aspects of the performance to create a unified partnership, making art song performance one of the \"most sensitive type(s) of collaboration\". As well, the pianist must be able to closely match the mood and character expressed by the singer. Even though classical vocalists generally embark on successful performing careers as soloists by seeking out opera engagements, a number of today's most prominent singers have built their careers primarily by singing art songs, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Thomas Quasthoff, Ian Bostridge, Matthias Goerne, Wolfgang Holzmair, Susan Graham and Elly Ameling. Pianists, too, have specialized in playing art songs with great singers. Gerald Moore, Geoffrey Parsons, Graham Johnson, Dalton Baldwin, Hartmut H\u00f6ll and Martin Katz are six such pianists who have specialized in accompanying art song performances. The piano parts in art songs can be so complex that the piano part is not really a subordinate accompaniment part; the pianist in challenging art songs is more of an equal partner with the solo singer.
