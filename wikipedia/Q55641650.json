After forcing Ali to save Nicola's life, Phelan requests for a hostage and selects Michelle - despite Robert's pleas to be taken instead to no avail. When Phelan clocks his gun and threatens to kill Michelle and Robert, Michelle quickly complies to spare Robert and she is taken hostage by Phelan. He drags her into the kitchen, where he finds himself confronted by Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) - whom Phelan had blackmailed into sleeping with four years earlier before going on to frame her for pushing Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) off a ladder a year earlier, which resulted in Anna's four month imprisonment until she was released at the time Phelan's crimes were exposed on the week Michelle proposed to Robert. As Anna and Phelan exchanged glances at each other, Michelle used this opportunity to try and escape from Phelan's clutches - prompting him to shove her aside and shoot Michelle.

Shortly afterward, Robert bursts into the kitchen with Ali and Carla.
