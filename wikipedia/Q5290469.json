In 2007, he joined Stockport County and then Milton Keynes Dons on loan, before signing with the Dons permanently later in the year. He left the Dons after just a few months, and then signed with Stockport. In 2009, he transferred to Bristol Rovers, before leaving the club following a brief period on loan at Port Vale in 2011. He signed with Yeovil Town in July 2011, who were promoted out of League One via the play-offs in May 2013. He switched to Plymouth Argyle for a two-year spell in June 2013. He turned to acting in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "High Wycombe", "response": ["*Dominic Blizzard \u2013 former footballer, most recently with Plymouth Argyle."]}, {"page": "Bristol Rovers F.C.", "response": ["The first time Rovers encountered Yeovil was a Football League Trophy match which was played on 31 October 2001, which Rovers won via a penalty shoot-out. The most recent encounter between the teams was in a Football League Two match on 16 April 2016, which Rovers won 2\u20131. Because of the close proximity many players have also represented both the clubs, for example Adam Virgo, Gavin Williams, Dominic Blizzard and Tom Parkes."]}, {"page": "Stockport County F.C.", "response": ["Stockport County won nine league matches in succession without conceding a goal from January to March 2007 under manager Jim Gannon, a Football League record. Wayne Hennessey, then on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers, kept a clean sheet in his first nine games in professional football. Hennessey received the League Two Player of the Month award in March. The other players involved were: Robert Clare, Michael Rose, Ashley Williams, Gareth Owen, Stephen Gleeson, Jason Taylor, Adam Griffin, David Poole, Damien Allen, Anthony Pilkington, Tony Dinning, Dominic Blizzard, Liam Dickinson, Adam Proudlock, Tes Bramble and Anthony Elding."]}, {"page": "Jim Gannon", "response": ["Losing four of his first five games in charge, Gannon was forced to respond to criticism over his team selections and substitutions, and announced plans to expand the club's non-playing staff. On 1 February the players met with the Chairman and rumours spread that Gannon had 'lost the dressing room', as comparisons were made with the tenure of Brian Clough in The Damned United. Yet the next day an O'Shea volley gave Vale a 1\u20130 win over promotion rivals Rotherham United to give Gannon his first win in charge at the club. However tension remained, as proven at the end of the month when it was reported that Gannon left the team bus on a pre-match journey after rowing with assistant manager Geoff Horsfield. Gannon had previously told the press his staff were 'underqualified', though insisted any changes would be 'implemented at a later stage' and that Horsfield was a 'great assistant'. It was later reported in the national media that Horsfield had requested a day off to deal with a family matter, Gannon then granted him permission but subsequently wrote a letter to the board complaining of his conduct. An unnamed director then handed the letter to Horsfield, who confronted Gannon over the issue, brandishing the letter as proof when Gannon denied its existence. This came on the same day that local paper The Sentinel ran an editorial that questioned his loan signings, his decision to drop Gary Roberts and branded his tactics and team selections as baffling. Having returned to the team to steer his side to a 2\u20131 victory over Aldershot, Gannon said \"there's been misrepresentation in the media over my part in this. I'm completely the innocent party\". The club informed Horsfield that he would face a disciplinary hearing, whilst Gannon would not be asked to defend his actions and would merely provide a witness statement. The club took no action, and after Horsfield spent two weeks at home the pair returned to work as before. He continued to exploit the loan market, signing Dominic Blizzard from Bristol Rovers, a midfielder who played under him at Stockport."]}, {"page": "Sheku Kamara", "response": ["Kamara made his first professional appearance on 19 September 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute for Dominic Blizzard in the League Cup second round victory over Accrington Stanley."]}, {"page": "Michael Woods (footballer)", "response": ["On 29 February 2012, Woods played his first match in Yeovil's Somerset Premier Cup defeat by Clevedon and his performance was impressed by Johnson as Woods looks to win a first-team place.

He assisted the opening goal, crossing in for Byron Webster to head home after five minutes, before being substituted for Dominic Blizzard.

Stoke's next opponent was Bristol Rovers and it was again Tuncay who opened the scoring after Rovers keeper Mikkel Andersen failed to keep out his first shot allowing him to tap in.

After Horsfield was told to stay away from the club for two weeks he was invited back to his assistant role as before, with no disciplinary action taken against either party. As the club fell to seventh in the tale, Gannon made another loan signing by bringing Dominic Blizzard in from Bristol Rovers. Results continued to go against the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3\u20130 at Accrington Stanley, and as a result dropped out of the play-off zone for the first time in the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media \"I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him\". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out. These rumours were proved accurate two days later, as Gannon's departure was confirmed by the club. Loan signing Blizzard also left. Mark Grew took over as caretaker-manager, though following a 2 April defeat to leaders Chesterfield he was forced to admit that automatic promotion was now out of reach. Later in the month Grew released Kristian Cox, before a home defeat to bottom of the table Stockport County on 23 April meant that winning their remaining three games no longer guaranteed them a play-off spot. Their penultimate game of the season was a 7\u20132 mauling of Morecambe, which saw Louis Dodds and Justin Richards score the first hat-tricks at Vale Park since Martin Foyle hit three in 1994.
