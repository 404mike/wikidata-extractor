Thomas Legh died on 8 May 1857.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lyme Park", "response": ["The first record of a house on the site is in a manuscript folio dated 1465, but that house was demolished when construction of the present building began during the life of Piers Legh\u00a0VII, in the middle of the 16th\u00a0century. This house, by an unknown designer, was L-shaped in plan with east and north ranges; piecemeal additions were made to it during the 17th\u00a0century. In the 1720s Giacomo Leoni, an architect from Venice, added a south range to the house creating a courtyard plan, and made other changes. While he retained some of its Elizabethan features, many of his changes were in a mixture of Palladian and Baroque styles. During the latter part of the 18th\u00a0century Piers Legh\u00a0XIII bought most of the furniture which is in the house today. However, the family fortunes declined and the house began to deteriorate. In the early 19th\u00a0century the estate was owned by Thomas Legh, who commissioned Lewis Wyatt to restore the house between 1816 and 1822. Wyatt's alterations were mainly to the interior, where he remodelled every room. Leoni had intended to add a cupola to the south range but this never materialised. Instead, Wyatt added a tower-like structure (a hamper) to provide bedrooms for the servants. He also added a one-storey block to the east range, containing a dining-room. Later in the century William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, added stables and other buildings to the estate, and created the Dutch Garden.  Further alterations were made to the gardens by Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton and his wife during the early 20th\u00a0century.  During the Second World War, the park was used as an RAF lorry depot. In 1946 Richard Legh, 3rd Baron Newton, gave Lyme Park to the National Trust. From 1947 the estate was managed by Stockport Corporation and its successor Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council until 1994 when the National Trust took direct control.", "Immediately to the northeast of the house is the Orangery which was designed in 1862 by Alfred Darbyshire.  The Orangery is joined to the house by a covered passage known as the Dark Passage. This was designed by Wyatt for Sir\u00a0Thomas Legh in 1815 and is a Grade\u00a0II listed building.  Further from the house, to the northeast of the orangery, are the stables (). These are dated 1863 and were also designed by Darbyshire. They are built in sandstone on a courtyard plan and are listed at Grade\u00a0II.  Other structures in the grounds listed at Grade\u00a0II are the Pheasant House dating from about 1870, an Italian white marble wellhead in the centre of the courtyard of the house dating from the 18th\u00a0century and probably brought to the house from Venice in about 1900, sandstone kennels in an H-plan dating from around 1870, a pair of gardener's cottages dated 1871, terrace revetment walls to the west of the house containing some 17th-century masonry with later repairs, the lodge, gate piers and gates on Lyme Park Drive, the forward gatepiers to Lyme Park Drive, dating from the late 17th\u00a0century and moved to their present position about 1860, the gate piers in Red Lane, and the gate piers, gates and railings to the north of the north front of the house."]}, {"page": "Shrigley abduction", "response": ["William Turner was elected Member of Parliament for Blackburn as a Whig in 1832, serving until 1841.

Richard Evans (1778\u20131864), a printer from Paternoster Row in London, bought a share in Edge Green Colliery in Golborne in 1830. An explosion in May 1831 killed up to twelve workers and the following May another explosion killed another six. In 1831 the collieries were connected to the growing railway network by a branch line to the Warrington and Newton Railway at Newton Junction. Evans bought Legh's share off Turner and Legh's business, which then took the title Turner & Evans. When Turner died, in 1847, Evans acquired his share and the firm took the title Richard Evans & Sons.
