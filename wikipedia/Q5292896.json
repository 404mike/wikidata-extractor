He scored twice on his debut, a 2\u20132 draw away to Reading on 11 September 1946, but made only three further appearances that season. Kelly had remained an amateur when joining Torquay, but turned professional in July 1947. However, due to the form of Jack Conley, he was to play just once the following season, scoring in the 2\u20130 win away to local rivals Exeter City on 17 January 1948.\nHe left Torquay and league football at the end of the season, joining Symington's. From there he moved to Stafford Rangers where he was top scorer in the 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351 and 1951\u201352 seasons.
