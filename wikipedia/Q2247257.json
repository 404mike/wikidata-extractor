The band plays Irish traditional music with a mixture of different other genres, including rock, jazz, blues, bluegrass, swing, salsa, polka and even rap.

The sessions were beacons for many very talented musicians. Music buffs travelled to hear Doherty reunited again with Ciaran Tourish and Dinny McLaughlin, as well as Paul Rodden, Michael Gallinagh, Laurence Doherty and visiting musicians such as Cathal Hayden. Many of these names were to feature strongly in the years to come. Doherty also hit the road, busking in Dublin, Galway and London among other places.", "In the early 1990s The Gooseberries also went their separate ways and this was quickly followed by Doherty being asked to support Tanita Tikaram on a UK tour, which he did successfully as a solo act. Shortly afterwards came a call from another group, Four Men and a Dog.  Mick (Black Dog) Daly (hence the band's name), the original singer and guitar player, had left the band. Doherty was asked to replace him and they are still together in 2007, with a hiatus period in-between of a few years around the turn of the millennium. Four Men and a Dog could justifiably be described as one of the 'super groups' of traditional Irish and folk music. Each member is recognised as being among the most talented musicians, not just in Ireland, but worldwide. The line-up currently consists of Cathal Hayden on fiddle and banjo, Gerry O'Connor on banjo and fiddle, Gino Lupari on bodhran, percussion and vocals, Donal Murphy on accordion and Doherty on vocals and guitar. Previous line-ups included Conor Keane on accordion and Brian McGrath on banjo and keyboards.
