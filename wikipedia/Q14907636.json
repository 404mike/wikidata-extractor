Berdan primers, patent by American inventor Hiram Berdan in 1866, are a simple capsule, and the corresponding case has two small flash holes with a bulged bar in between, which serves as the \"anvil\" for the primer.  Boxer primers, patented by Royal Artillery colonel Edward Mounier Boxer also in 1866, are more complex and have an internal tripedal \"anvil\" built into the primer itself, and the corresponding case has only a single large central flash hole.  Commercially, Boxer primers dominate the handloader market due to the ease of depriming and the ability to transfer sparks more efficiently."]}, {"page": "Centerfire ammunition", "response": ["An early form of centerfire ammunition, without a percussion cap, was invented between 1808 and 1812 by Jean Samuel Pauly.. This was also the first fully integrated cartridge and used a form of obturation employing the cartridge itself. Another form of centerfire ammunition was invented by the Frenchman Clement Pottet in 1829; however, Pottet would not perfect his design until 1855. The centerfire cartridge was improved by B\u00e9atus Beringer, Benjamin Houllier, Gastinne Renette, Smith & Wesson, Charles Lancaster, Jules-F\u00e9lix G\u00e9velot, George Morse, Francois Schneider, Hiram Berdan and Edward Mounier Boxer.", "Meanwhile, Colonel Edward Mounier Boxer, of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, England was working on a primer cap design for cartridges, patenting it in England on October 13, 1866, and subsequently received a U.S. patent for his design on June 29, 1869, in ."]}, {"page": "Henry Trengrouse", "response": ["It was not, however, until 28 February 1818, after many journeys to London, that Trengrouse exhibited his apparatus before Admiral Sir Charles Rowley. A committee was appointed, and on 5 March it reported 'that Mr. Trengrouse's mode appears to be the best that has been suggested for the purpose of saving lives from shipwreck by gaining a communication with the shore; and, so far as the experiments went, it most perfectly answered what was proposed;\u2019 it was also suggested that a specimen apparatus should be placed in every dockyard that naval officers might become familiar with its working.Parl. Papers, 1825, xxxi.361 In the same year a committee of the Elder Brethren of Trinity House also reported in its favour, and recommended that 'no vessel should be without it.' The government ordered twenty sets, but afterwards preferred to have them constructed by the ordnance department, and paid Trengrouse \u00a350 compensation. In 1821 the Society of Arts awarded him their large silver medal and thirty guineas for the invention. Alexander I of Russia also wrote Trengrouse an autograph letter, presented him with a diamond ring in recognition of the usefulness of his apparatus, and invited him to Russia; but apart from the prize awarded by the Society of Arts and the compensation paid by the government, Trengrouse reaped no pecuniary reward from his invention. An improved rocket was invented by John Dennett in 1826; a later model was devised by Edward Mounier Boxer in 1855. It became, next to the lifeboat, the most important means of saving lives from shipwrecks. Thousands of lives were saved in that way.Tables relating to Life Salvage, 1897"]}, {"page": "History of rockets", "response": ["In 1865 the British Colonel Edward Mounier Boxer built an improved version of the Congreve rocket by placing two rockets in one tube, one behind the other."]}, {"page": "Boxer (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward Mounier Boxer (1822\u20131898), British inventor and army officer"]}]}}
