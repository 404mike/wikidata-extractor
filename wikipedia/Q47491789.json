Scholars such as J. Kathryn Josserand, Nick Hopkins and others published findings that helped to construct a Mayan vocabulary. In 1988 Wolfgang Gockel published a translation of the Palenque inscriptions based on a morphemic rather than syllabic interpretation of the glyphs. The \"old school\" continued to resist the results of the new scholarship for some time. A decisive event which helped to turn the tide in favor of the new approach occurred in 1986, at an exhibition entitled \"The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art\", organized by InterCultura and the Kimbell Art Museum and curated by Schele and by Yale art historian Mary Miller. This exhibition and its attendant catalogue\u2014and international publicity\u2014revealed to a wide audience the new world which had latterly been opened up by progress in decipherment of Maya hieroglyphics. Not only could a real history of ancient America now be read and understood, but the light it shed on the material remains of the Maya showed them to be real, recognisable individuals. They stood revealed as a people with a history like that of all other human societies: full of wars, dynastic struggles, shifting political alliances, complex religious and artistic systems, expressions of personal property and ownership and the like. Moreover, the new interpretation, as the exhibition demonstrated, made sense out of many works of art whose meaning had been unclear and showed how the material culture of the Maya represented a fully integrated cultural system and world-view. Gone was the old Thompson view of the Maya as peaceable astronomers without conflict or other attributes characteristic of most human societies."]}, {"page": "1994 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"|  Nick Hopkins"]}, {"page": "2014 in British television", "response": ["|BBC Two's Newsnight appoints The Guardian newspaper's investigations editor, Nick Hopkins as its investigations correspondent."]}, {"page": "2016 in British television", "response": ["|The Guardian newspaper appoints Newsnights investigations correspondent, Nick Hopkins as its head of investigations."]}, {"page": "1995 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Nick Hopkins || 8:11.86"]}, {"page": "Timeline of BBC Two", "response": ["*2 May \u2013 BBC Two's Newsnight appoints The Guardian newspaper's investigations editor, Nick Hopkins as its investigations correspondent."]}]}}
