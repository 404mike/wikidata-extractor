He competed in the individual and team road race events at the 1932 Summer Olympics.Born in 1932 in West Norwood, Butler cycled with the Norwood Paragon team, and competed with his team-mate Frank Southall in tandem-paced racing at Herne Hill velodrome. In the 1932 Olympics, the team rode cross-country en route to the competition when Butler was injured during a training ride in Toronto. Consequentially, he started the 100km (62.14 miles) Olympic road race badly handicapped. Nonetheless, he competed and supported the Chambers brothers, Ernest and Stanley, who won silver medals in the tandem sprint. Britain finished fourth in the four kilometres team pursuit. After World War II he won the national 24-hours time trial championship in 1950, covering 458.18 miles (19.09mph) in atrocious weather conditions to set a new British record.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1932 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Stanley Butler", "* Stanley Butler"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1932 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual time trial", "response": ["| 16 ||align=left| Stanley Butler ||align=left|  || 2:37:19.6 ||"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1932 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team time trial", "response": ["| 4 ||align=left| Frank SouthallCharles HollandStanley Butler ||align=left|  || 7:44:53.0 ||"]}]}}
