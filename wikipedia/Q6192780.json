Her early films demonstrate Craigie's interest in socialist and feminist politics, but her career as a film-maker has been \"somewhat eclipsed\" by her marriage to the Labour Party leader Michael Foot (1913\u20132010), whom she met during the making of her film The Way We Live (1946).

Given Connery's rugged appearance and rough charm, Hamilton initially thought he was an appalling person and was not attracted to him until she saw him in a kilt, declaring him to be the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen in her life. He also shared a mutual attraction with jazz singer Maxine Daniels, whom he met at the Empire Theatre.

David Cesarani alleged in his biography of Koestler, published in 1998, that Koestler had been a serial rapist, citing the case of the British feminist writer Jill Craigie who said that she had been his victim in 1951. Feminist protesters forced the removal of his bust from Edinburgh University. In his biography, Koestler: The Indispensable Intellectual (2009), Michael Scammell countered that Craigie was the only woman to go on record that she had been raped by Koestler, and had done so at a dinner party more than fifty years after the event. Claims that Koestler had been violent were added by Craigie later, although Scammell concedes that Koestler could be rough and sexually aggressive. Some critics believed that Cesarani's claims of Koestler having been a 'serial rapist' were unfounded; in his review of Cesarani's biography in The New York Times, the historian Mark Mazower observed: \"Even those who applaud Cesarani for bringing the rape issue forward may wonder whether his approach is not too one-sided to make for a convincing portrait. Koestler was a domineering man. But he attracted women and many remained close friends after they had slept with him. It is implausible to write them all off as masochists, as Cesarani effectively does. Some broke with him; but then so did many other friends and acquaintances.\" Similarly, John Banville, in the London Review of Books, wrote:", ":Koestler himself, and at least one Hungarian friend, saw nothing odd in (Koestler's) bed-hopping. \"In Central Europe\", George Mikes wrote in defence of Koestler, \"every woman was regarded as fair game. She could always say 'no' and ... her no would be taken for an answer, even if grudgingly.\" Cesarani will have none of this political incorrectness, and stoutly declares: \"There is evidence that as well as his consistent violence against women Koestler was a serial rapist.\" The evidence that Cesarani adduces in support of this accusation is an account of a particular encounter between Koestler and Jill Craigie, the wife of Michael Foot."]}, {"page": "1960 Ebbw Vale by-election", "response": ["A heavy downpour of rain on the days before the poll gave bad omens to Foot's wife Jill Craigie who blamed the rain for her husband's loss of Devonport in 1955.
