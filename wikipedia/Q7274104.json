Hudson was considered in his day to be the most gifted geometer in all of Cambridge.  Hudson's life was cut short when he died in a mountaineering accident at the age of 28, but his posthumously-published book Kummer's Quartic Surface allows mathematicians today access to his work.He was the son of W.H.H. Hudson, Professor of mathematics at King's College London. Hudson's sister, Hilda Hudson was likewise a gifted mathematician, being a graduate of Newnham, a lecturer at the University of Berlin, and ultimately being awarded the O.B.E. in 1919.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1904", "response": ["** R.
