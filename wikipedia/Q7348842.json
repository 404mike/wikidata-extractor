The season was abandoned and thus officially never took place. (I had the same situation with Robert Perrett who played in all three Southampton matches, but is shown as having made no league appearances for the club.) I would put the status of these matches alongside play-off matches; they can be included in a player's total appearances but are not League matches for infobox purposes. Purely my personal opinion.    Daemonic Kangaroo (talk) 06:26, 7 August 2010 (UTC)"]}, {"page": "Perrett, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Perrett"]}]}}
