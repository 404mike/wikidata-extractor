Fox CEO Kevin Reilly said that the series would essentially represent the twelve \"most important\" hours of a typical 24 season, with jumps forward between hours as needed.

The New York Times characterized Logan's administration as \"a projection of our very worst fears\" of the government.

The character's opening scene (in which she, unsatisfied with her hairdo, dunks her head into a sink) was called \"the most memorable character debut in 24 history\".
