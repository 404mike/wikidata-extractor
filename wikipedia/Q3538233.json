He particularly praised the satire of a traffic jam, Tennant's acting, and the use of Martha as a companion to aid the Doctor's loss. Ian Berriman of SFX gave \"Gridlock\" four out of five stars. He praised the attention to detail of the props department, the appearance of the Macra, and the concept of the traffic jam, but felt there were many plot holes. He also called Travis Oliver, the actor who played Milo, \"wooden\". Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger wrote that he did not like the episode much on first viewing because it was \"too busy and too chaotic to get a proper grip on\" but \"subsequent viewings proved those very qualities are the backbone of the story.\" He initially wished to see more of the Macra. Mark Wright of The Stage was positive towards calling back to \"The End of the World\" and \"New Earth\", and praised Agyeman and the visual look of the episode.
