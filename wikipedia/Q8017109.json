A traffic survey in 1954 revealed 9,600 vehicles were using the bridge daily and it closed 7,000 times a year. A replacement bridge was considered vitally important to the local economy, particularly that of Trafford Park. William Proctor, MP for Eccles, said \"I cannot think of any other project in the North of England which should have higher priority than the Barton Bridge scheme.\" Construction of the replacement Barton High Level Bridge started in 1957; the bridge opened to traffic in October 1960 and has been referred to informally as the \"Barton Bridge\". Traffic on the swing bridge has also been reduced by the construction of Centenary Bridge located upstream towards Salford."]}, {"page": "William Proctor (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Proctor (British politician)"]}]}}
