Gelbier recalls in his memoirs that during this post, many years before other articles on the damage to teeth by sugary drinks, he was encouraged to write his first paper about a child with tooth decay who drank about 8 bottles of cola a day. Subsequently he was assigned to the Department of Children\u2019s dentistry, followed by a post at The London Hospital, Whitechapel, and then a lectureship in child dental health at The London Hospital Medical College. He was inspired by the founder of dental clinics for children with disabilities, Neil Swallow, amongst others."]}, {"page": "James Neil Swallow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Neil Swallow"]}]}}
