Skinner and Travers had been members of the band Kites with Paul McGrath and Ian McGreevy before Hipsway formed.  Their music was characterized by Skinner's deep vocals and Jones' rhythmic guitar style.  They were quickly signed up by Mercury Records and by 1985 had released their first, eponymously titled album.  The album was a moderate success on the UK Albums Chart; while the single \"The Honeythief\", made number 17 on the UK Singles Chart, and also reached the top 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Prior to Willcock joining, the songs had been written by Jazzateers core members, Ian Burgoyne and Keith Band, and sung by various vocalists (Alison Gourlay, the Rutkowski Sisters, Grahame Skinner, Paul Quinn). However the injection of new blood provided by Willcock and lead guitarist Mick Slaven, created the perfect environment for Jazzateers to finally hit their peak flow. Slaven's Tom Verlaine / Robert Quine influences took centre stage in the group, along with Willcock's poetic lyrical approach.", "Grahame Skinner (vocals)"]}, {"page": "Grahame skinner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Grahame Skinner "]}]}}
