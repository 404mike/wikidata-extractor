Hughes was nicknamed 'Yogi', derived from the popular cartoon character Yogi Bear, said to be due to his large build.

His next appearance came a month later, away against Hearts. He was again on the losing side (4\u20133), but scored his first senior goal. Despite the defeats, Johnstone's performances won him a place in the team for the Scottish Cup Final on 4 May 1963 against Rangers. The young winger turned in a fine performance, helping Celtic to a creditable 1\u20131 draw with his confident dribbling. He also scored a goal but it was disallowed due to a foul moments earlier by teammate John Hughes. Inexplicably, Johnstone was dropped for the replay and Celtic were outclassed by Rangers, who ran out comfortable 3\u20130 winners."]}, {"page": "Lisbon Lions", "response": ["A second goalkeeper was the only substitute allowed at the time.

McBride rewarded Stein with 43 goals that season. Celtic lost the first Old Firm derby that season, but gained revenge by winning the League Cup final against Rangers. Celtic reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but were beaten 2\u20131 on aggregate by Liverpool. Five minutes before the end of the second leg at Anfield, Bobby Lennox appeared to score a goal that would have put Celtic through on the away goals rule, but it was controversially disallowed for offside. Celtic were involved in a tight Scottish league championship race with Rangers, who they also played in the 1966 Scottish Cup Final. The final was lost after a replay, to a goal by Kai Johansen. Stein blamed John Hughes for failing to mark Johansen.

Six minutes later, Racing Club took the lead when C\u00e1rdenas scored from 25 yards out with a superb left-footed shot into goalkeeper Fallon's top left corner. Celtic were reduced further in numbers after 74 minutes when John Hughes was sent off for kicking Cejas as he lay on the ground.  Shortly afterwards Rulli was sent off for punching Celtic's John Clark.  Two minutes from time, another melee erupted between the sides, resulting once again in the intervention of the Uruguayan riot police.  Bertie Auld was sent off, but refused to leave the field and eventually played the full match.  He was however reported by the referee afterwards.  Whilst Auld refused to leave the field, amidst the total chaos on the field Tommy Gemmell kicked one of the Racing Club players in his genitals, which went unnoticed by the referee.  The game finished 1\u20130 to Racing Club, clinching the trophy for the South American champions and making them the first Argentinian holders of the Intercontinental Cup.
