Friction between the Griquas and the settlers over land rights resulted in British troops being sent to the region in 1845. It marked the beginning of nine years of British intervention in the affairs of the region, which the British named Transorange.Karel Schoeman, The British Presence in the Transorange 1845\u20131854, Human & Rosseau, Cape Town, 1992, p.11, "]}, {"page": "Fife", "response": ["* John Philip, missionary in South Africa"]}, {"page": "Andrew Geddes Bain", "response": ["While resident in Grahamstown he wrote some satirical sketches for local amateur dramatic entertainment and invented the character Caatje Kekelbek or Life Among the Hottentots (1838), also known as Kaatje Kekkelbek (Katie Gossip) who endeared herself forever to South Africans, and held John Philip and other missionaries up to ridicule.

Moshoeshoe, a minor Basotho chief, had welded together a number of scattered and broken clans which had sought refuge in that mountainous region after fleeing from Mzilikazi, and had formed the Basotho nation which acknowledged him as king. In 1833 he had welcomed as workers among his people a band of French Protestant missionaries, and as the Boer immigrants began to settle in his neighborhood he decided to seek support from the British at the Cape. At that time the British government was not prepared to exercise control over the immigrants. Acting upon the advice of Dr John Philip, the superintendent of the London Missionary Society\u2019s stations in South Africa, a treaty was concluded in 1843 with Moshoeshoe, placing him under British protection. A similar treaty was made with the Griqua chief Adam Kok III. By these treaties, which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which Boer farmers were settled, the British sought to keep a check on the Boers and to protect both the natives and Cape Colony. The effect was to precipitate collisions between all three parties."]}, {"page": "Philippolis", "response": ["The London Missionary Society founded Philippolis in 1823 as a mission station serving the local Griqua people. At first, the area was referred to as Southern Transorangia.  The town takes its name from Dr John Philip, who was the superintendent of the Society from 1819 to 1849. Adam Kok II, a Griqua leader, settled in Philippolis with his people in 1826 and became the protector of the mission station. Kok II and some of his followers moved to Philippolis from Griquatown (about 200\u00a0km away) following conflict in the area. When Adam Kok II was given possession of the mission station it was on condition that he promised to protect the San against the aggression of the Boers and the London Missionary Society hoped that the Griqua would promote peace in the region. However, Philippolis became a base from which a number of deadly commandos against the San people were organised within a year of the Griqua arrival. This violated the agreement made between the London Missionary Society and Adam Kok II and eventually the San were driven out of the area. Kok's son, Adam Kok III and his followers later migrated across the Drakensberg mountains to settle in Kokstad in Griqualand East."]}, {"page": "1851 in South Africa", "response": ["* 27 August - John Philip, a London Missionary Society's missionary to South Africa, dies at age of 76 at Hankey in the Cape Colony"]}, {"page": "St Machar's Cathedral", "response": ["* South aisle, window 2 - by Daniel Cottier 1870s - Faith Hope and Charity: A memorial to George Jamesone, John Philip and William Dyce"]}, {"page": "Benjamin D'Urban", "response": ["Although D'Urban was popular with the white colonists, his treatment of the Xhosa people and other Africans in South Africa disturbed John Philip, who went to England to give evidence before a parliamentary committee and aroused public opinion against D'Urban.
