He composed primarily in Welsh, but was also responsible for the first known poem in the English language written by a Welshman. His father Hywel Swrdwal was also a poet, and there are doubts as to whether a number of extant works should be attributed to the father or to the son. He is reputed to have composed a history of Wales, but this has not survived.\nThe Hymn to the Virgin was written by Ieuan at Oxford in about 1470 and uses a Welsh poetic form, the awdl, and Welsh orthography; for example:\n\nThe poem consists of 96 lines in 13 stanzas. It is an address to Christ through the Virgin Mary.\nAn alternative claim for the first poem in English written by a Welshman is made for John Clanvowe's The Book of Cupid, God of Love or The Cuckoo and the Nightingale, a long love poem based on The Owl and the Nightingale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal (c. 1430 \u2013 c. 1480, W)"]}, {"page": "Welsh literature in English", "response": ["Welsh writing in English might be said to begin with the fifteenth-century bard Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal (?1430 - ?1480), whose Hymn to the Virgin was written at Oxford in England in about 1470 and uses a Welsh poetic form, the awdl, and Welsh orthography; for example:"]}, {"page": "Hywel Swrdwal", "response": ["Hywel composed poems on themes of patriotism and religion.
