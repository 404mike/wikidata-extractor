CPV-TV was the highest bidder, but was eliminated for failing the quality threshold; since both Thames and Carlton were deemed to have passed the quality threshold, the franchise was awarded to Carlton for having submitted the higher cash bid of the remaining two companies. Some commentators consequently speculated that Thames had fallen victim to a \"government vendetta\", whilst others felt that the auction had been won fairly."]}, {"page": "Carlton Communications", "response": ["In 1967 Michael Green established a printing and photo-processing company, Tangent Industries, with his brother-in-law and his father-in-law (the future Lord Wolfson).

The deal was blocked by both Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames, and by the IBA, which concluded \"the proposal would lead to a major change in the nature and characteristic of a viable ITV programme company\". Michael Green was left \"bewildered\", saying: \"We are surprised at the IBA's decision. I'm absolutely certain it would not have been a major change to Thames. We have always suggested that we would make absolutely sure the company would continue to be what it is at this moment in time.\" IBA said it had nothing against Carlton owning part of an ITV company, but believed 'any' single ownership of an ITV company was undesirable.Guardian Friday, 11 October 1985 P20, Dennis Barker \" Carlton Communications proposal ruled unaccepted\"- IBA blocks sale of Thames", "Thames finally floated on the stock market in July 1986. A few days afterwards, speculation appeared that Carlton had attempted to buy a sizable number of shares. Michael Green, chairman of Carlton, was quoted as saying, \"I can't possibly comment\", but a Thames spokesperson said: \"It does seem quite likely; however, no one shareholder can own more than 10% of our equity, so it's difficult to see what they might have in mind\".Carlton chases Thames shares to 40p premium.

Carlton chairman Michael Green said: \"The ITC library is a jewel in the crown. We can now unite it with the other gems from Britain's film and television heritage in our excellent library.\" From September 1999, Central Broadcasting and Westcountry Television were re-branded as Carlton.BFI: Carlton Westcountry This later paved the way for the eventual downgrading of all of ITV's regional identities, though the names were never fully dropped as their news programmes Central News and Westcountry Live continued, and eventually returned to the air (albeit as ITV1 Central and ITV1 Westcountry) in 2004. In 2000, United Business & Media proposed a merger with Carlton.Carlton to sue UBM over failed ITV merger However, the parties were outmanoeuvred by Granada, which took over only the television interests of UNM (the rest of the company remains in existence).

While described as a merger, it was essentially a take-over by Granada as its shareholders would own two-thirds of the new company, Charles Allen would become chief executive and Michael Green would leave the company he had built.ITV shares on London stock market After the merger, the Granada brand would remain in Granada Television and Granada Productions. In contrast, the Carlton franchises dropped the Carlton name for local programming from the day of the merger (2 February 2004) with the Carlton network production brand disappearing from 1 November 2004; even the London weekday franchise started trading as ITV1 London (Weekdays), and was operationally (though not legally) merged with London Weekend Television as ITV London.
