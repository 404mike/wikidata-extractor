He was replaced by Ian Branfoot, who until the end of the 1990\u201391 season had been assistant manager to Steve Coppell at Crystal Palace. By this stage, a key player in the Southampton line-up was Guernsey-born attacking midfielder/striker Matthew Le Tissier, who broke into the first team in the 1986\u201387 season. He was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 1990 and later made eight appearances for the England team\u00a0\u2013 he finally retired in 2002 at the age of 33. Another exciting young player to break into the Southampton team just after Le Tissier was Alan Shearer, who at the age of 17 scored a hat-trick against Arsenal in a league match in April 1988. Shearer was a first team regular by 1990, and stayed with Southampton until July 1992, when he was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a national record of more than \u00a33\u00a0million. He then became the most expensive footballer in the world when Blackburn sold him to Newcastle for \u00a315\u00a0million in 1996.

Ten minutes before half-time Shilton rushed from his line to help the defender cut off a Liverpool attack but the goalkeeper then collided with his own player. Wright was stretchered off due to injury and Southampton again lost after extra-time against the eventual champions.
