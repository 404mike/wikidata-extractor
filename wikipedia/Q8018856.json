The pistol belonged to the UDA, which until August 1992 was a legal organisation under British law. A further suspect, Brian Nelson, was a member of the Army's Force Research Unit. He had provided information about Finucane's whereabouts, and also claimed that he had alerted his handlers about the planned killing."]}, {"page": "Stobie", "response": ["* William Stobie (1950\u20132001), Ulster Defence Association (UDA) quartermaster and RUC Special Branch informer"]}]}}
