The son of a master baker, Charles learnt to bake, but ran away at the age of 22 to join the Merchant Navy. At an unknown time in his life, Green had an accident which resulted in the loss of one of his testicles. This resulted in Green having a somewhat squeaky and high-pitched voice, which was the source of jokes amongst his fellow crew aboard the Endurance. Whilst in Buenos Aires on board the Andes in October 1914, he heard word that Shackleton had fired the expedition's cook, for drunkenness, and was subsequently hired. Green was described as \"conscientious almost to the point of being single-minded\" with a \"frail\" disposition..\nDuring the expedition, Green was assisted by able seaman Perce Blackborow, who had come on board as a stowaway. Green, though subject to \"ribbing\" from his crew mates, was nonetheless looked upon as a well-liked member of the expedition. His nicknames onboard included Chef or Cookie. He was also sometimes called \"Doughballs\" due to his high-pitched voice. During the three hours a day that the men worked during their time stuck in the Antarctic pack ice, Green and Blackborow were working day and night in the galley. When the ship sank after being trapped in the ice, he continued to cook for the crew during their camps on the ice, with limited equipment which included a blubber stove. A few days after the crew arrived on Elephant Island, Green collapsed from exhaustion, and was ordered to rest until he recovered.\nAfter the crew were rescued, Green returned to England, though with great difficulty acquiring passage. Upon his arrival, he discovered his parents had cashed out his insurance policy, and his girlfriend had married another man. He joined the Royal Navy as a cook, taking part in World War I. He was wounded in August 1918 whilst serving on the Destroyer H.M.S. Wakeful, and re-joined the Merchant Navy in 1919.\nGreen was invited to re-join Shackleton on another expedition to Antarctica, the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition, along with many other crew members from Endurance.  During this trip, Shackleton gave Green a set of lantern slides before his death shortly after arrival at South Georgia. The expedition continued without Shackleton, but was not a great success. After returning to England in 1922, Green once again rejoined the Merchant Navy, working on board a variety of ships until his retirement in 1931. Green would use the slides given by Shackleton years before to give lectures and tours about the Endurance expedition later in life.He became a Fire Watcher during World War II within the city of Hull.\nGreen was one of the last surviving members of the Endurance crew, and attended the 50th Anniversary reunion in 1964 with the two remaining survivors. He died at the age of 85 of periontitis in Hull.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Green", "response": ["Charles Green may refer to:", "* Charles Green (painter) (1840\u20131898), English painter and illustrator", "* Charles Green Shaw (1892\u20131974), American abstract artist and writer", "* Sir Charles Green, 1st Baronet (1749\u20131831), British Army general", "* Charles Green (Australian soldier) (1919\u20131950)", "* Charles Green (cricketer) (1846\u20131916), English cricketer", "* Charlie Phil Rosenberg or Charles Green (1902\u20131976), American boxer, world champion bantamweight", "* Charles Green (bobsleigh) (1914\u20131999), British Olympic bobsledder", "* Charles Green (athlete) (1921\u20132009), Australian Olympian", "* Charles Green (astronomer) (1734\u20131771), British astronomer, traveled with James Cook", "* Charles Green (balloonist) (1785\u20131870), England's most famous balloonist of the 19th century", "* Charles Green (bishop) (1864\u20131944), Archbishop of Wales", "* Charles Green (cook) (1888\u20131974), British ship's cook on Shackleton's Endurance expedition", "* Charles Green (archaeologist) (1901\u20131972), English archaeologist", "* Charles Green (businessman) (born 1953), British businessman with Rangers F.C. and Sheffield United F.C.", "* Charles Greene (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness.Huntford 1975, p.\u00a0656.

Shackleton was troubled with heart pain throughout the voyage, but despite Macklin's orders refused to rest. In Rio, Shackleton suffered a heart attack but would not let Macklin examine him. The ship landed in South Georgia on 4 January 1922. Early in the morning of 5 January, Macklin was called to Shackleton's quarters to find him having another heart attack. He died shortly after Macklin arrived.

Clark travelled in the 22\u00bd-foot James Caird with Shackleton, Frank Hurley, Leonard Hussey, Reginald James, James Wordie, Harry McNish, Charles Green, John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. On arriving at the island, Shackleton set out almost immediately with five of the crew to fetch rescue from South Georgia. The rest of the men, Clark among them, stayed camped on the island with Frank Wild in command. Elephant Island was inhospitable. It was cold but humid which meant that neither the clothing nor the sleeping bags were ever completely dry. Though there were penguins and seals to eat, the supplies were not inexhaustible and fuel was scarce. The routine on the island was monotonous. Clark managed to produce a primitive alcoholic beverage from methylated spirit, sugar, water and ginger which became known as \"Gut Rot 1916\" and was drunk with a toast to \"Wives and Sweethearts\" on Saturdays. On 30 August 1916, the men on Elephant Island were rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship Yelcho, four months after he had left the island."]}, {"page": "Personnel of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["| Charles Green"]}, {"page": "Personnel of the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition", "response": ["|100x100pxCharles Green||1888||1974||Cook||Veteran of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition"]}]}}
