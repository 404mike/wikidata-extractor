Former managers include Bill Shankly, Alan Ashman, Bob Stokoe, Harry Gregg, Mick Wadsworth, Nigel Pearson and Paul Simpson.

The club started the following 2011\u201312 season well, and were 3rd going into October, but a bad run of form resulted in the sacking of Wadsworth in December, with former manager Neale Cooper returning to the club as his replacement.

Jim Harvey replaced Wadsworth and managed an immediate upturn in form, which gave fans some slim hope that the club might still survive in the Conference National. However, dwindling attendances, a pitch protest and continued financial problems meant that the playing squad was gradually released to cut the wage bill though, and Chester's improved form did not last. Harvey was himself sacked in January 2010 by Morrell Maison, the club's new director of football, who then installed himself as the new manager. He oversaw what was arguably the club's lowest moment when just 518 people turned up to see the team beaten 1\u20130 by lower-league Fleetwood Town in the FA Trophy.

Robson watched LuaLua before deciding to negotiate the transfer, and said, \"I see [LuaLua] as a special talent. He has to learn how to play with the other players but he's a special new talent. He has to be nursed and cherished and taught. But we are buying long-term a very promising talent, a very promising player.\" LuaLua signed a five-year contract with the club. He made his first-team debut in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Charlton Athletic in September 2000 and made 23 league and cup appearances for Newcastle in the 2000\u201301 season without scoring. He scored twice in Newcastle's Intertoto Cup campaign at the beginning of the 2001\u201302 season but his first Premiership goal did not come until April 2002, when he scored a last-minute winner in a 3\u20132 away win against Derby County. He scored a further two goals in the remaining four games of the season. LuaLua's goalscoring form continued to the beginning of the 2002\u201303 season when he scored three goals in his first four games. Tougher competition for a first-team place meant that LuaLua made only 22 appearances in this season. In January 2003, LuaLua urged Robson to rotate the squad, saying, \"I think I deserve a chance now, as do many of the lads on the fringes of the team. Although some people might have the idea that those of us not in the team like sitting on the bench and getting paid good money, nothing could be further from the truth. I'm not in this for the money, I want to play for the first team and show what I can do on a regular basis.\" LuaLua also spent much of the beginning of the 2003\u201304 season on the bench and in November 2003, complained about his lack of first-team football and indicated that he would consider leaving Newcastle. In the Newcastle Chronicle, Robson responded, saying he would not take advice from a player about how to manage the side: \"How dare he say this? I run this football club... LuaLua has been a pretty poor professional about all this. What he should do is keep his mouth shut and get out there and do what he is paid for.\" In the end, he made 88 league and cup appearances for Newcastle, scoring nine goals, having started 21 games and made 67 appearances as a substitute.", "In September 2011, after his release by Omonia, LuaLua trained with League One club Hartlepool United, where he linked with former Newcastle United assistant-manager Mick Wadsworth. However, he was offered a contract by Blackpool who play a level above in the Championship. After two substitute appearances, Lualua's first start saw him score twice in Blackpool's 5\u20130 win over Leeds United at Elland Road, Leeds' joint-heaviest home defeat.. On 2 January 2012, he scored his first goal of the new year against Middlesbrough. For the second time in his Blackpool career he was on the score sheet as Blackpool beat Fylde coast neighbours Fleetwood Town 5\u20131 in the third round of the FA Cup.
