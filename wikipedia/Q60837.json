Austin explained the descriptive focus for legal positivism by saying, \"The existence of law is one thing; its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not is one enquiry; whether it be or be not conformable to an assumed standard, is a different enquiry.\" For Austin and Bentham, a society is governed by a sovereign who has de facto authority. Through the sovereign's authority come laws, which for Austin and Bentham are commands backed by sanctions for non-compliance. Along with Hume, Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept, and was an avid prison reformer, advocate for democracy, and firm atheist. Bentham's views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student John Austin. Austin was the first chair of law at the new University of London, from 1829. Austin's utilitarian answer to \"what is law?\" was that law is \"commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience\".John Austin, The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined (1831) H.\u00a0L.\u00a0A. Hart criticized Austin and Bentham's early legal positivism because the command theory failed to account for individual's compliance with the law."]}, {"page": "Philosophy of law", "response": ["*Legal positivism, which is the view that law depends primarily on social facts. Legal positivism has traditionally been associated with three doctrines: the pedigree thesis, the separability thesis, and the discretion thesis. The pedigree thesis says that the right way to determine whether a directive is law is to look at the directive's source. The thesis claims that it is the fact that the directive was issued by the proper official within a legitimate government, for example, that determines the directive's legal validity\u2014not the directive's moral or practical merits. The separability thesis states that law is conceptually distinct from morality. While law might contain morality, the separability thesis states that \"it is in no sense a necessary truth that laws reproduce or satisfy certain demands of morality, though in fact they have often done so.\" Legal positivists disagree about the extent of the separability thesis. Exclusive legal positivists, notably Joseph Raz, go further than the standard thesis and deny that it is possible for morality to be a part of law at all. The discretion thesis states that judges create new law when they are given discretion to adjudicate cases where existing law underdetermines the result. The earliest proponent of legal positivism was John Austin who was influenced by the writings of Jeremy Bentham in the early 19th century. Austin held that the law is the command of the sovereign backed by the threat of punishment. Contemporary legal positivism has long abandoned this view. In the twentieth century, two positivists had a profound influence on the field: Hans Kelsen and H. L. A. Hart. Kelsen is most influential for his notion of 'grundnorm,' an ultimate and basic legal norm, which some scholars, especially in Europe, accept today. In the Anglophone world, Hart has been the most influential scholar. Hart rejected the earlier claim that sanctions are essential to law and instead argued that law is  rule-based. According to Hart, law is a system of primary rules that guide the conduct of law's subjects, and secondary rules that regulate how the primary rules may be changed, identified, and adjudicated. Hart's theory, although widely admired, sparked vigorous debate among late twentieth century philosophers of law including Ronald Dworkin, John Rawls, Joseph Raz, and John Finnis.", "*John Austin (legal philosophy)"]}, {"page": "Sovereignty", "response": ["Within the modern governmental system, internal sovereignty is usually found in states that have public sovereignty and is rarely found within a state controlled by an internal sovereign.  A form of government that is a little different from both is the UK parliament system.  John Austin argued that sovereignty in the UK was vested neither in the Crown nor in the people but in the \"Queen-in-Parliament\". This is the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and is usually seen as the fundamental principle of the British constitution.  With these principles of parliamentary sovereignty, majority control can gain access to unlimited constitutional authority, creating what has been called \"elective dictatorship\" or \"modern autocracy\".  Public sovereignty in modern governments is a lot more common with examples like the US, Canada, Australia and India where the government is divided into different levels."]}, {"page": "1790", "response": ["* March 3 \u2013 John Austin, English jurist (d. 1859)"]}, {"page": "Jeremy Bentham", "response": ["Bentham's students included his secretary and collaborator James Mill, the latter's son, John Stuart Mill, the legal philosopher John Austin, American writer and activist John Neal.

He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly to those who were not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham's time, membership of the Church of England and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of race, creed or political belief, it was largely consistent with Bentham's vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a \"more than passive part\" in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that \"his interest was greater than his influence\".
