Growing up in a devoutly Presbyterian family, he was one of five sons, four of whom became Texas Rangers. He grew up on the Welch ranch in San Saba County, and later spent time in Oxford, Llano County, which is now a ghost town; he later joked about being the only \"Oxford-educated Ranger\". Although his formal education ended after the sixth grade, as a youth he displayed several unusual abilities, including an extremely high level of intelligence and a near eidetic memory.Boessenecker, p. 9 He excelled at mathematics and developed a deep interest in history, particularly that of the Texas Rangers and the region's Native American tribes, such as the Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache.Boessenecker, pp. 9-11 He worked in his father's shop as a youth, and as a wrangler on a local ranch.", "Beginning in 1922 Hamer led the fight in Texas against the Ku Klux Klan as senior captain of the Texas Rangers, which was still growing in Texas, and he saved 15 people from lynch mobs throughout his career.John Boessenecker, Texas Ranger: the Epic Life of Frank Hamer, the Man Who Killed Bonnie and Clyde, St. Martin's, 2016  A less successful incident happened during the Sherman Riot of 1930, however.  Hamer and a handful of Rangers were charged with protecting the trial of a black rape suspect, George Hughes, in the town of Sherman.  A large mob approached the courthouse, and Hamer personally shot and wounded two of the mob's members.  However, the mob set fire to the courthouse.  Hamer and the Rangers escaped the building, but did not bring Hughes with them or stay around to check on his condition; instead they got into a borrowed car and drove away from Sherman, abandoning the town.  If Hughes had survived the fire, he did not survive the mob afterward, who used dynamite on the vault he'd been locked in and strung Hughes's dead body up.  Sherman's black district was looted by the mob afterward, with the Rangers unwilling or unable to stop them.", " The commander of the Texas Rangers allowed him to retain a Special Ranger commission as an active Senior Ranger Captain even after his official retirement. The special commission is listed in the state archives in Austin.Frank Hamer, Texas Ranger Warrant of Authority, 1931. Texas State Library & Archives Commission", "thumb|The posse. Top, L to R: Hinton, Oakley, Gault; seated, L to R: Alcorn, Jordan and Frank Hamer.", "In mid-March, Henry Methvin's family contacted Bienville Parish Sheriff Henderson Jordan about their son, his legal troubles, and his involvement with Barrow. Hamer was a lone wolf by nature, but he eventually formed an inter-jurisdictional posse and created a plan to ambush the gang. Sheriff Jordan and his deputy Prentiss Oakley, an excellent marksman, were the first to join the posse. Hamer brought in fellow former Ranger Maney Gault who had resigned from the Ranger force when \"Ma\" Ferguson was elected and now worked for the Texas Highway Patrol. Hamer asked Dallas County Sheriff Smoot Schmid to assign his deputy Bob Alcorn full-time to the case; Schmid sent Alcorn and Ted Hinton, another Dallas County deputy.Guinn, p. 288Hinton remembered Bonnie from the Dallas caf\u00e9 where she had waited tables four years before. Alcorn had picked up 16 year-old Clyde in West Dallas for stealing chickens, though he did not arrest him. The two deputies and Schmid had tried to ambush Bonnie and Clyde in late November 1933 near Sowers, Texas. They examined Barrow's abandoned V-8 Ford at Sowers and discovered that the bullets from his Thompson submachine gun had not penetrated its body, so this time Hinton requested a Browning automatic rifle.Cartledge, Rick.  \"The Guns of Frank Hamer.\" The Sight's M1911 .45 ACP Page  ", "Hamer had learned a great deal about the lives of Barrow and Parker in the preceding months, and he told reporters that, under other circumstances, he \"would have gotten sick\" to see a woman's perforated body in the car; as it was, he did not get sick because he remembered Parker's crimes. \"I hated to shoot a woman\u2014but I remembered the way in which Bonnie had taken part in the murder of nine peace officers. I remembered how she kicked the body of the highway patrolman at Grapevine and fired a bullet into his body as he lay on the ground.\", although it is possible he did not realize that said incident was reported in an alleged eyewitness report, rather than an official statement of her crimes. I'm Frank Hamer, Chapters 20\u201323. Methvin Online Hamer also said that he hated \"to bust the cap on a woman, especially when she was sitting down, however if it wouldn't have been her, it would have been us.\"Cox, p. 161. This, however, does not correspond to an account published by the FBI that the gang was trying to drive away when they were shot down.", "In 1953, Frank Hamer suffered a heat stroke; he lived two more years but never regained his health.Milner, p. 158. He was buried near his son Billy in Memorial Park Cemetery in Austin. He was wounded 17 times during his life and left for dead four times. He is credited with having killed between 53 and 70Toland, p. 296. people.", "Ken Farmer also played Texas Ranger Frank Hamer in the movie, \"The Newton Boys\".IMDB", "*Boessenecker, John (2016).
