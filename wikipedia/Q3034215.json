The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, who included Oscar Wilde, Alfred Milner and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer W. G. Collingwood, were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably Arnold Toynbee, Leonard Montefiore and Alexander Robertson MacEwen. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the university settlements,Stuart Eagles, After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870\u20131920 (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103\u201309. and was keenly celebrated by the founders of Ruskin Hall, Oxford.Stuart Eagles, \"Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford\" in Ruskin Review and Bulletin, vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19\u201329.", "Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, W.
