He is best known for being in the progressive rock band Yes across five tenures between 1971 and 2004 and for his solo albums released in the 1970s.\nBorn and raised in West London, Wakeman intended to be a concert pianist but quit his studies at the Royal College of Music in 1969 to become a full-time session musician. His early sessions included playing on \"Space Oddity\", among others, for David Bowie, and songs by Junior's Eyes, T. Rex, Elton John, and Cat Stevens. Wakeman became a member of The Strawbs in 1970 before joining Yes a year later, playing on some of their most successful albums across two stints until 1980. Wakeman began his solo career in 1973; his highest-selling solo albums are his first three: The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1973), Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1974), and The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (1975), all concept albums. He formed his rock band, The English Rock Ensemble, in 1974, with which he continues to perform, and scored his first film, Lisztomania (1975).\nWakeman pursued solo projects in the 1980s that varied in levels of success; his most successful album was 1984, released in 1981, which was followed by his minor pop hit single, \"Glory Boys\", from Silent Nights (1985). He hosted the television show Gastank, and recorded his first of several New-age, ambient, and Christian music albums with Country Airs (1986) and The Gospels (1987), respectively. From 1988 to 1990 he was a member of Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe which led to his third Yes stint until 1992. He returned twice more between 1995 and 2004, during which he completed several more solo projects and tours, including his most significant of the decade, Return to the Centre of the Earth (1999). From 2016 to 2020, Wakeman was a member of Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman. He continues to record albums and perform concerts worldwide in various capacities; his most recent album is The Red Planet (2020).\nWakeman's discography includes over 90 solo albums spanning a range of musical styles. He has made many television and radio appearances; in recent years he became known for his contributions to the BBC comedy series Grumpy Old Men, Watchdog and his radio show on Planet Rock that aired from 2005 to 2010. Wakeman has written three books; an autobiography and two memoirs.

Author Edward Macan thinks this is because of its versatility, allowing both chords and lead lines to be played, and a choice between quiet and clean, and what Emerson described as a \"tacky, aggressive, almost distorted, angry sound\". However, progressive rock historian Paul Stump argued that initially, the popularity of the Hammond organ in progressive rock was less due to the suitability of the instrument to the genre than to its ubiquity in popular music, much like the electric guitar. Emerson first found commercial success with the Nice, with whom he used and abused an L-100, putting knives in the instrument, setting fire to it, playing it upside down, or riding it across stage in the manner of a horse. He continued to play the instrument in this manner alongside other keyboards in Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Other prominent Hammond organists in progressive rock include Argent's Rod Argent, Yes's Tony Kaye and Rick Wakeman, Focus's Thijs van Leer, Uriah Heep's Ken Hensley, Pink Floyd's Rick Wright, Kansas's Steve Walsh, and Genesis's Tony Banks.

He wrote over three-dozen songs, many of which would appear on his fourth studio album Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust; among these were \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"Hang On to Yourself\", which he recorded with his short-lived band Arnold Corns in February 1971, and subsequently reworked for Ziggy Stardust.

The sessions also featured keyboardist Rick Wakeman on piano who, after completing work on the album, declined Bowie's offer to join the Spiders to instead join the English progressive rock band Yes. According to Woodmansey, Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust were almost recorded back-to-back. However, the Spiders realised that most of the songs on Hunky Dory were not suitable live material, so they needed a follow-up that could be toured behind.", "Following the departure of Rick Wakeman on piano, the songs on Ziggy Stardust are considerably less piano-led than the songs on Hunky Dory and are more guitar-led, primarily due to the influence of Ronson's guitar and string arrangements. Nevertheless, biographers have noted stylistic similarities to Hunky Dory in \"Velvet Goldmine\" and the string arrangement for \"Starman\". Along with guitar and strings, Ronson played piano on the album, and according to Pegg, his playing on tracks like \"Five Years\" and \"Lady Stardust\" foreshadow the skills he would showcase on Lou Reed's Transformer (1972). Meanwhile, his electric guitar playing dominates tracks like \"Moonage Daydream\", \"It Ain't Easy\", \"Ziggy Stardust\", and \"Suffragette City\". Additionally, Bowie's acoustic guitar playing is prominent on some tracks, notably \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\". Perone argues that although listeners tend to pay closer attention to Ronson's electric, Ziggy Stardust is \"one of the better albums\" in Bowie's catalogue to highlight his rhythm guitar playing.", "As well as including faster-paced numbers (\"Star\"), the album also contains the minimalist tracks \"Five Years\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\". Both tracks are primarily led by Bowie's voice, building intensity throughout their runtimes. While \"Five Years\" contains what author David Buckley calls a \"heartbeat-like\" drum beat, \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" starts acoustic and builds to a lush arrangement, backed by an orchestra. Pegg describes \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" as Bowie's own \"A Day in the Life\". The album also features some experimentation. \"Soul Love\" contains bongos, a hand-clap rhythm and a saxophone solo from Bowie, which Doggett calls \"relaxing\". \"It Ain't Easy\" features a harpsichord contribution from Rick Wakeman and backing vocals from Dana Gillespie, both of which were uncredited.

The portable Minimoog, which allowed much easier use, particularly in live performance was widely adopted by progressive rock musicians such as Richard Wright of Pink Floyd and Rick Wakeman of Yes. Instrumental prog rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can and Faust to circumvent the language barrier.
