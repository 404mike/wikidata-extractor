Former Love Affair and Morgan member Morgan Fisher joined as keyboardist and Mick Bolton joined on Hammond Organ. Bolton left at the end of 1973 and was replaced on tour by Blue Weaver, while Fisher stayed on to become Allen's official replacement in the band. Ralphs left in August 1973 to form Bad Company and was replaced by former Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor. For contractual reasons, he changed his name to Ariel Bender at the suggestion of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul for his stint with the band. According to Ian Hunter, interviewed in the documentary Ballad of Mott the Hoople, the band were in Germany with de Paul for a TV show when Mick Ralphs walked down a street bending a succession of car aerials in frustration. De Paul came out with the phrase \"aerial bender\" which Hunter later suggested to Grosvenor as a stage name.Ballad of Mott the Hoople documentary, c. 39:30", "In 1974, Mott the Hoople toured America with Ariel Bender playing lead guitar. In one of Bender's earliest performances with the band they played the Masonic Temple in Detroit on 12 October 1973 with a young Aerosmith opening the show. They were primarily supported on the '74 tour by the band Queen. This tour later provided the inspiration for Queen's 1975 single \"Now I'm Here\", which contains the lyrics \"Down in the city, just Hoople and me.\" The song became a live favourite of Queen fans and reached No.\u00a011 in the UK Singles Chart. The tour resulted in a lifelong friendship between the two bands, with Ian Hunter, Mick Ronson and David Bowie performing \"All the Young Dudes\" at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992. Morgan Fisher went on to play piano on Queen's 'Hot Space' tour in 1982, and Brian May, Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor performed backing vocals on the Ian Hunter solo song, \"You Nearly Did Me In\". May would later cover Mott's \"All the Way from Memphis\" on his solo album, Another World, with Hunter making a guest appearance. Mott the Hoople are name-checked on two other hit singles. Reunion's 1974 single \"Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)\" begins with the lyrics 'B Bumble and the Stingers, Mott the Hoople, Ray Charles Singers...'.; and R.E.M.'s \"Man on the Moon\" begins with 'Mott the Hoople and the Game of Life, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...'", "In February 2018 it was announced that Mott the Hoople would be playing several European dates in the summer of 2018.

I know many people were disappointed when neither appeared on the 2009 and 2013 get-togethers.
