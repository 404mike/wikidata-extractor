A fast-paced inside or outside right, he could have chosen sprinting if he had not taken up football.Settle played for Bolton Wanderers and Bury before joining Everton for a fee of \u00a3400 in 1899, with whom he won the FA Cup in 1906. Settle was the Football League First Division's leading goalscorer for the 1901\u201302 season with 18 goals, the lowest of the highest totals achieved in the English top-flight to date. In 1908 Settle was sold to Stockport County, his final club before retiring from football.\nSettle represented England 6 times between 1899 and 1903, playing in the British Home Championship against the other Home Nations, scoring 6 times, including a hat-trick against Ireland in February 1899. Settle scored England's only goal in the match against Scotland in April 1902 which was expunged from the records and replayed as a result of the Ibrox disaster which occurred during the game. Settle's goal in this match is not included in his international record.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Millom", "response": ["* Jimmy Settle, English international footballer, was born in Millom in 1874."]}, {"page": "British Home Championship", "response": ["|  Andrew Gara   Jimmy Settle   Robert Hamilton (2)"]}]}}
