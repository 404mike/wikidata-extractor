Coles' interest in the trackways led to the Somerset Levels Project, which ran from 1973 to 1989, funded by various donors including English Heritage. The project undertook a range of local archaeological activities, and established the economic and geographic significance of various trackways from the third and first millennia BC. The work of John Coles, Bryony Coles, and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1996 when they won the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge, and in 2006 with the European Archaeological Heritage Prize."]}, {"page": "1946 in archaeology", "response": ["* August 12 - Bryony Coles, n\u00e9e Orme, English prehistoric landscape archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Doggerland", "response": ["Interest was reinvigorated in the 1990s by Bryony Coles, who named the area \"Doggerland\" \"after the great banks in the southern North Sea\" \u2013 and produced speculative maps of the area.B.J.
