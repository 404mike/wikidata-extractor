He was a member of the department of Greek and Latin at University College London for over 30 years, and won international distinction for his work in ancient philosophy, especially physics (or \"natural philosophy\") and in the Peripatetic tradition after Aristotle. His pioneering interest in previously under-studied figures such as Alexander of Aphrodisias led the way in the field.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander of Aphrodisias", "response": ["Alexander composed several commentaries on the works of Aristotle, in which he sought to escape a syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of Aristotle.
