He is based in Maastricht, Netherlands.\nThe results of Summers' multiple, art-related activities have often appeared as part of his concept of VEC (Visual, Experimental, Concrete), which he originated in 1973. In 1999 CNN International featured Summers in its Art Club show as a representative of avant-garde art in the Netherlands.  In addition, over the last 20 years, Summers has performed his work at various festivals in Europe and Iceland, including the Reykjavik Art Festival (1991), the Polypoetry Festival of Sound Poetry (Bologna, 1993), and the International Sound Poetry Festival (Bologna, 1997), among others.\nSummers features among the \"second wave\" of intermedia artists, the first wave including Dick Higgins, Vito Acconci, John Cage, Allan Kaprow, Joseph Beuys, and the Fluxus artists of the 1960s.  He differs from Higgins and members of the first generation, however, in that he is less theoretical and more experiential in his approach to his art.  There have been no VEC manifestos published by Summers, although one may intuit what it encompasses by examining the activities undertaken and products issued under its sign.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of performance poets", "response": ["*Rod Summers"]}, {"page": "List of sound artists", "response": ["*Rod Summers"]}, {"page": "Art manifesto", "response": ["With the participation of 34 artistic networkers (such as, Anna Banana, Sarah Jackson, Madelyn 'Honoria' Starbuck, Judith Hoffberg, Vittore Baroni, Ken Friedman, John Held Jr., Ruud Janssen, Gy\u00f6rgy Gal\u00e1ntai, Rod Summers, Andrej Tisma) from 13 countries Guy Bleus (aka 42.292) wrote the RE: E-Mail-Art & Internet-Art Manifesto.
