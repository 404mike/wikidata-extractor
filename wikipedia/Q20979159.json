A comprehensive report published in February 2004 argued against the provision of an air ambulance service from Scotland in favour of either a separate Northern Ireland service, or one provided as part of an all Ireland coordinated system. In 2006 Rodney Connor, Chief Executive of Fermanagh District Council, and Peter Quinn, Consultant, produced a report on the need for an Air Ambulance in rural areas and after presentation to the Council was brought to the attention of the Department for Health. In 2012 Rodney Connor decided to work again on the need for an Air Ambulance and along with the Minister for DETI brought together a group of Trustees. The trustees of the AANI came together in December  2013 to commence the process of forming a charity-led company to run an air ambulance. Independently, in late 2013, Dr John Hinds and other members of the Northern Ireland Regional Faculty of Prehospital care began discussing ways of encouraging the development of a fully-fledged HEMS at a time when the only air support for casualty evacuation was from either  Coastguard or PSNI helicopters. After a near fatal accident at the North West 200 motorcycle race in May 2015, Dr Hinds' views received widespread support and he began a public campaign for Northern Ireland to have its own air ambulance. In March 2016, the key findings of a HEMS consultation were announced. In August 2016, it was announced by the Northern Ireland government that Air Ambulance NI would partner with the health service in Northern Ireland to provide the helicopter emergency medical service."]}]}}
