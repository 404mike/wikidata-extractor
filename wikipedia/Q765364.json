In it, the Oxford academics detail with considerable rigour how on a visit to Versailles in 1901 they believed they had found themselves walking in the Trianon of 1789 and seen Marie-Antoinette.  Their account was initially published in 1911 under the pseudonyms Miss Morison and Miss Lamont, in a vain attempt to protect their reputations. Jourdain died in 1924 whilst principal, her demise possibly brought on by the criticism she and Moberly received for daring to involve Oxford University in something so unscientific.  For the 1931 edition, and to support Moberly, Edith invited the scientist J.W. Dunne to introduce the account with a note concerning his interest in Serialism (and its fourth dimension) and how this might explain what Moberly and Jourdain had seen. And perhaps what occasionally happened to her."]}, {"page": "August 1901", "response": ["* The \"Moberly\u2013Jourdain incident\" gave rise to one of the more famous \"ghost stories\" of the early 20th century, which Charlotte Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain would recount a decade later in their bestselling book An Adventure. Both of them were administrators at St Hugh's College, a women's college associated with the University of Oxford. While in France visiting the Palace of Versailles, they walked into the Petit Trianon, a ch\u00e2teau on the grounds of the former French royal palace. According to the 1911 book, they not only saw the ghost of Marie Antoinette (who had been arrested at that location on August 10, 1792), but her companions as well. After researching the era, they would conclude that they had witnessed the area as it had looked exactly 109 years earlier, by experiencing the memories that two different people had had in 1792, with Jourdain seeing from the point of view of the doomed Queen of France, and Moberly watching through the eyes of one of the Queen's escorts."]}, {"page": "Annie Moberly", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlotte Anne Moberly"]}, {"page": "An Adventure", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlotte Anne Moberly"]}]}}
