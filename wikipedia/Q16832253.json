The story was produced for the BBC website by Big Finish, but due to BBC moving its webcast production in-house (and the subsequent death of Maggie Stables), it is unlikely that the cliffhanger will ever be resolved. Big Finish producer Gary Russell, who wrote the story, has also stated that he has no firm plans for continuing the story and it should, for the moment, be regarded as \"unofficial\".
