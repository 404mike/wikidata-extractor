Other than its size and location, everything about the island in the book describes southeastern Africa, not Madagascar. European contact began on August 10, 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island after his ship separated from a fleet going to India. The Portuguese traded with the islanders and named the island S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o (Saint Lawrence). In 1666, Fran\u00e7ois Caron, the director general of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The company failed to establish a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon (now R\u00e9union) and Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. On \u00cele Sainte-Marie, a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar, Captain Misson and his pirate crew allegedly founded the famous pirate utopia of Libertatia in the late 17th century. From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar was a favorite haunt for pirates.  Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.From MADAGASCAR to the MALAGASY REPUBLIC, by Raymond K.

In 1875, A. Newton analysed Julien Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified a description of the Rodrigues parrot. In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter."]}, {"page": "Samuel Oliver", "response": ["* Samuel Pasfield Oliver (1838\u20131907), English artillery officer, geographer and antiquary"]}, {"page": "Sieur Dubois", "response": ["Sieur Dubois or Sieur D.
