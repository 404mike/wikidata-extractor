Derbyshire lost the match by a very large margin as the Essex batsmen notched up two centuries and two scores in the 90s before Hardy ended two of their innings with catches behind the stumps. Hardy, a right-handed batsman, put on ten runs for the team.Hardy died in Ilkeston aged 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hardy (surname)", "response": ["*Solomon Hardy, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Alfred Charlesworth", "response": ["Charlesworth played three matches for Derbyshire in the 1888 season, the first of the seasons when they lost first-class status and made little impression. Charlesworth reappeared for Derbyshire in the 1898 season, making his first-class debut against Essex. Despite being absent hurt in the first innings, he returned during Derbyshire's attempt at bowling out a high-scoring Essex team, in which every player but wicket-keeper Solomon Hardy and opener Sydney Evershed had a crack at bowling, in many cases economical but unsuccessful. Charlesworth played six more first-class matches for the club in the season. He only bowled again in a draw against Nottinghamshire. His last match was against Yorkshire in what remains the highest score against Derbyshire. He was absent hurt again in this match, this time in the second innings."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1898", "response": ["The most significant addition to the Derbyshire squad in the season was Billy Bestwick  as well known for his antics off the pitch as his demon bowling. William Ellis played the first of several seasons at the club when he played occasional games. Alfred Charlesworth and James  Wright also made their debuts and played several matches in the season, although only Wright played in a subsequent season. William Prince, John Bourne and  Solomon Hardy each played just one career match for Derbyshire in the season"]}]}}
