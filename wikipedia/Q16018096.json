Finances were extremely tight but Frith made some shrewd low-cost signings, including Irish international Reg Ryan, Alan Daley, and Accrington's George Stewart. When the club's goalkeeper, Jim Sanders, broke his leg in September Frith persuaded 44-year-old Alf Wood, who played his first game in 1938 and had returned to the club as a trainer, to take his place. Wood played ten games, of which the team lost only one, before being replaced with the signing of Arthur Lightening. Frith's tactics paid off, and City were promoted in second place, behind Port Vale. Coventry's good form continued in the 1959\u201360 season, and they were a contender for a second-successive promotion until Easter. But a run of three defeats in the final matches meant that they missed out. Once more in a perilous financial situation, Coventry started 1960\u201361 poorly with only four wins in the first sixteen games. They rallied in the middle part of the season, but another poor run consigned them to a poor finish. The most significant aspect of the season was that Walter Brandish was replaced by Derrick Robins as club chairman; it was under Robins' chairmanship that the club's fortunes were transformed."]}, {"page": "Colin Lyman", "response": ["Lyman was appointed as player-manager at Birmingham Combination club Nuneaton Borough on 2 August 1948. He brought 24-year old Walsall forward Jimmy Campbell, as well as Arsenal inside-forward David Metzger and Notts County goalkeeper Harold Orgill. He led the club to lift the Birmingham Senior Cup and a second-place league finish to Bedworth Town, with Lyman contributing 18 goals from 35 games. He strengthened the squad by signing 23-year old outside-left Alan Daley from Mansfield Town. They finished third in the 1949\u201350 season and reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time in the club's history, beating Bedworth Town, Moira United, Atherstone Town, Gresley Rovers, Wellington Town, King's Lynn and Mossley, before they were eliminated by Exeter City. Speaking at the end of season dinner he declared that: \"I know my directors are keen to see first-class football in Nuneaton the same as myself, but there is a long way to go yet. There are other clubs with the same idea, but if we get the support, I think in a few years first class football will be seen in Nuneaton.\" In an attempt to overcome champions Bedworth Town, he signed their inside-left Jim McKeown, who was regarded as one of the division's finest players. He also brought in Ralph Dulson at inside-right, who had helped Linby Colliery to the Central Alliance title. The front three was completed with the arrival of Latvia international Eddie Freimanis from Northampton Town. Lyman resigned in December 1950 so as to take up another job. He went on to serve Long Eaton Town as player-manager and played for British Timken."]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Alan Daley Ray Straw"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alan Daley"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alan Daley"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alan Daley"]}]}}
