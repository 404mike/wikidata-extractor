In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat, and re-introduced the Bill, despite the continued opposition of peers in the House of Lords. Frustrated by the Lords' obdurate attitude, Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. The King objected\u2014though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers, he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours.Allen, p. 132. William reluctantly agreed to the creation of the number of peers sufficient \"to secure the success of the bill\".Correspondence of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, with William\u00a0IV and Sir Herbert Taylor, edited by Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, (1867) 2.102, 113, quoted in Brock However, the King, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the peerage, told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and collateral heirs of existing peers, so that the created peerages would eventually be absorbed as subsidiary titles. This time, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments. Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety.Allen, pp. 137\u2013141; Ziegler, pp. 196\u2013212. The King refused, and accepted their resignations. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King's popularity sank to an all-time low. Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed. The King agreed to reappoint Grey's ministry, and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. Concerned by the threat of the creations, most of the bill's opponents abstained and the 1832 Reform Act was passed. The mob blamed William's actions on the influence of his wife and brother, and his popularity recovered.Ziegler, pp. 214\u2013222."]}, {"page": "Earl Grey", "response": ["| 3 || Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey(1802\u20131894) || 1845\u20131894 || Maria Copley, Countess Grey ||  ", "***25px Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey (1802\u20131894)"]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["***Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey (1802\u20131894), MP for Sunderland (1841\u20131845), Secretary at War (1835\u20131839), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies (1846\u20131852)"]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey"]}, {"page": "Richard Graves MacDonnell", "response": ["MacDonnell was called to the Irish bar in 1838, and to the English bar, at Lincoln\u2019s Inn, 25 January 1841.
