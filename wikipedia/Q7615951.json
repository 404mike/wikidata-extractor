He was an all-rounder, a right-handed middle-order batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler as well as being a fine slip fielder. He played for Surrey from 1960 to 1976, winning the County Championship with them in 1971, and subsequently appeared for Sussex in 1978. He was readily recognisable on the cricket field by his fair hair.He finished his first-class cricket career with over 10,000 runs, almost 500 wickets and more than 300 catches. He did the double for Surrey in 1966, the only occasion since World War II that a Surrey player has achieved the feat. He reached 1,000 runs in five seasons in all, but 1966 was the only time that he managed 100 wickets.\nHis last appearance in top-class cricket was when he appeared for Sussex in the Final of the Gillette Cup at Lord's on 2 September 1978. Sussex beat Somerset by five wickets, but Storey's contribution to their victory was minor; he did not bowl and scored 0 not out. This paralleled his experience when Surrey won the Benson and Hedges Cup during his last full season with them in 1974. In the Final at Lord's Surrey beat Leicestershire by 27 runs, but Storey scored only 2 and did not bowl.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Stewart Storey"]}, {"page": "1978 Gillette Cup Final", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" | Stewart Storey"]}, {"page": "Robin Lees", "response": ["Lees was born at Cranleigh in Surrey and later studied at St Edmund Hall at the University of Oxford.
