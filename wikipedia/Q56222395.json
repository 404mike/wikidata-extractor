After failing his course at the Australian National University in Canberra, he took a job on the Dubbo The Daily Liberal. In 1974, he moved to Sydney as a reporter for The Daily Mirror. In 1978, Allan was transferred to New York City to cover American news. His mentor Neal Travis introduced him to Rupert Murdoch during that time. In 1983, Allan returned to Australia, eventually rising to be editor-in-chief of the Telegraph. He met Lachlan Murdoch, who eventually told Allan he was to replace Xana Antunes as editor-in-chief of the New York Post in 2001. Allan took responsibility for running the erroneous 2004 story that Dick Gephardt had been chosen as John Kerry's running mate, described by Grove as \"the biggest gaffe of Allan\u2019s reign\".Grove, Lloyd (10 September 2007).
