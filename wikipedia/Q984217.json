The terms to describe it have changed throughout history; the Anglo-Saxon-rooted term \"cross-dresser\" has largely superseded the Latin-origin term \"transvestite\", which has come to be seen as outdated and derogatory. This is because the latter was historically used to diagnose psychiatric disorders (e.g. transvestic fetishism), but the former was coined by the transgender community. The Oxford English Dictionary gives 1911 as the earliest citation of the term \"cross-dressing\", by Edward Carpenter: \"Cross-dressing must be taken as a general indication of, and a cognate phenomenon to, homosexuality\". In 1928, Havelock Ellis used the two terms \"cross-dressing\" and \"transvestism\" interchangeably. The earliest citations for \"cross-dress\" and \"cross-dresser\" are 1966 and 1976 respectively."]}, {"page": "LGBT movements", "response": ["Another friend of Ives was the English socialist poet Edward Carpenter. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offense. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, The Intermediate Sex, would become a foundational text of the LGBT movements of the 20th century.

Socialist feminism as exemplified by the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women and Marxist feminism, spearheaded by Selma James, saw themselves as a part of the Left that challenges male-dominated and sexist structures within the Left. The connection between left-wing ideologies and the struggle for LGBTQ rights also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBTQ rights include Edward Carpenter, Oscar Wilde, Harry Hay, Bayard Rustin and Daniel Gu\u00e9rin, among others. The New Left is also strongly supportive of LGBTQ rights and liberation, having been instrumental in the founding of the LGBTQ rights movement in the aftermath of the Stonewall Uprising of 1969 and contemporary leftist activists and socialist countries such as Cuba are actively supportive of LGBTQ+ people and are involved in the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and equality."]}, {"page": "Socialism", "response": ["Many socialists were early advocates for LGBT rights. For early socialist Charles Fourier, true freedom could only occur without suppressing passions, as the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. Writing before the advent of the term \"homosexuality\", Fourier recognised that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and androg\u00e9nit\u00e9. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.Charles Fourier, Le Nouveau Monde amoureux (written 1816\u201318, not published widely until 1967: Paris: \u00c9ditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463. In Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man Under Socialism, he advocates for an egalitarian society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality. According to McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organisation that aimed to legalise homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of \"the Cause\". Edward Carpenter actively campaigned for homosexual rights. His work The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women was a 1908 book arguing for gay liberation. who was an influential personality in the foundation of the Fabian Society and the Labour Party. After the Russian Revolution under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky, the Soviet Union abolished previous laws against homosexuality. Harry Hay was an early leader in the American LGBT rights movement as well as a member of the Communist Party USA. He is known for his roles in helping to found gay organisations, including the Mattachine Society, the first sustained gay rights group in the United States which in its early days reflected a strong Marxist influence. The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality reports that \"[a]s Marxists the founders of the group believed that the injustice and oppression which they suffered stemmed from relationships deeply embedded in the structure of American society\". Emerging from events such as the May 1968 insurrection in France, the anti-Vietnam war movement in the US and the Stonewall riots of 1969, militant gay liberation organisations began to spring up around the world. Many sprang from left radicalism more than established homophile groups,Gay movement boosted by \u201979 march on Washington, Lou Chabarro 2004 for the Washington Blade. although the Gay Liberation Front took an anti-capitalist stance and attacked the nuclear family and traditional gender roles."]}, {"page": "William Blake", "response": ["In the 19th century, poet and free love advocate Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".Swinburne p. 260 Swinburne notes how Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.Swinburne, p. 249. Another 19th-century free love advocate, Edward Carpenter (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.Sheila Rowbotham's Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love, p. 135."]}, {"page": "Walt Whitman", "response": ["Peter Doyle may be the most likely candidate for the love of Whitman's life.Reynolds, 487.

He did not get out at the end of the trip\u2014in fact went all the way back with me.\"Kaplan, 311\u2013312. In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code \"16.4\" (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in the United States in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question\u2014\"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips.\"Stokes, John Oscar Wilde: Myths, Miracles and Imitations, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 194 Note 7.

Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his \"Calamus\" poems were homosexual\u2014John Addington Symonds inquired about \"athletic friendship,\" \"the love of man for man,\" or \"the Love of Friends\"\u2014he chose not to respond.Reynolds, 527. The manuscript of his love poem \"Once I Pass'd Through A Populous City\", written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man.", "Some, like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman both as a prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire \u2013 the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism.Robinson, Michael. Worshipping Walt. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010: 143\u2013145.  Whitman also influenced Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, and was a model for the character of Dracula.

The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical Utopia and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful.

Warner stated that while many thinkers had been theorising sexuality from a non-heterosexual perspective for perhaps a century, queerness represented a distinctive contribution to social theory for precisely this reason. Lauren Berlant and Warner further developed these ideas in their seminal essay, \"Sex in Public.\" Berlant, Lauren, and Michael Warner.

Critics such as Edward Carpenter, Guy Hocquenghem and Jeffrey Weeks had emphasised what they called the \u2018necessity of thinking about sexuality as a field of power, as a historical mode of personality, and as the site of an often critical utopian aim\u2019. Whereas the terms 'homosexual', \u2018gay\u2019 or \u2018lesbian\u2019 which they used signified particular identities with stable referents (i.e to a certain cultural form, historical context, or political agenda whose meanings can be analysed sociologically), the word \u2018queer\u2019 is instead defined in relation to a range of practices, behaviours and issues that have meaning only in their shared contrast to categories which are alleged to be 'normal'.
