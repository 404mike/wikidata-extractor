He has also been heavily involved in the development of multivariate scientific instrumentation and the attendant machine learning software (his first paper on artificial neural networks was in 1992). He has written extensively on the role of microbes as agents of supposedly 'non-communicable', chronic infectious diseases. According to Google Scholar his most cited peer-reviewed research papers are in functional genomics, metabolomics and the yeast genome. He has also been involved in research to create a robot scientist  in collaboration with Ross King, Stephen Muggleton and Steve Oliver as well as several projects in systems biology. He is heavily involved in the study of membrane transporters, and their necessary involvement in the transmembrane uptake of pharmaceutical drugs. An online talk and animation are available. He tends to choose scientific problems in which the prevailing orthodoxy is clearly incorrect. To this end, he has recently returned to the study of bioenergetics, summarising the detailed evidence against the prevailing wisdom of chemiosmotic coupling in oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation, replacing it with a protet-based model (an animation is available). His publications are mostly open access and are very widely cited, with an H-index at Google Scholar well in excess of 100. With Resia Pretorius he discovered the amyloidogenic clotting of blood, mostly caused by infectious agents even in supposedly non-infectious diseases; fibrin amyloid microclots (fibrinaloids) seem to be of major significance in Long COVID."]}, {"page": "Robot Scientist", "response": ["Robot Scientist (also known as Adam) is a laboratory robot created and developed by a group of scientists including Ross King, Kenneth Whelan, Ffion Jones, Philip Reiser, Christopher Bryant, Stephen Muggleton, Douglas Kell, Emma Byrne and Steve Oliver."]}, {"page": "Turing Institute", "response": ["Lord Balfour of Burleigh (Chairman) and Shirley Williams joined the board along with a growing team of researchers and AI specialists.
