Blessed with a voice capable of opera, Broadway, and pop, she creates funny but appreciative portraits of the women we love. . . . And to counter Lady Gaga singing Sound of Music tunes on the last Oscars, Dorothy appeared as Julie Andrews, singing an awkwardly proper version of 'Telephone,' complete with verses from 'Chim Chim Cheree.'
