He writes about sports \"from an anthropologic perspective.\"Kuper was born in Uganda of South African parents, and moved to Leiden in the Netherlands as a child, where his father, Adam Kuper, was a lecturer in anthropology at Leiden University. He has also lived in South Africa (to escape the Dutch winters), Stanford, California, Berlin and London. He studied History and German at Oxford University, and attended Harvard University as a Kennedy Scholar.  He now lives in Paris with his family.\nHe won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year in 1994 with his book Football Against the Enemy, which was later released in the United States as Soccer Against the Enemy. He has also written for The Observer and The Guardian, and is currently a sports columnist for the Financial Times.\nIn 2003 he published his book Ajax, The Dutch, the War: Football in Europe during the Second World War. He co-authored the 2009 book Soccernomics with Stefan Szymanski. The book put forward a formula allowing Kuper to predict that Serbia and Brazil would play the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final.Kuper usually writes about football, discussing the culture that surrounds it \u2014 such as the Old Firm rivalry \u2014 as well as the on-field play. He has written on cricket occasionally, with articles on cricket in the Netherlands and cricket in apartheid South Africa.Kuper also writes in Dutch, and his work frequently appeared in publications including the Dutch newspaper De Pers, the literary football magazine Hard Gras, and opinion magazine Vrij Nederland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "AFC Ajax", "response": ["*Simon Kuper, Ajax, The Dutch, The War.

It is played throughout the world, and is popular among members of the Irish diaspora in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and South Korea. In many parts of Ireland, however, hurling is a fixture of life. It has featured regularly in art forms such as film, music and literature. The final of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was listed in second place by CNN in its \"10 sporting events you have to see live\", after the Olympic Games and ahead of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship. After covering the 1959 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final between Kilkenny and Waterford for BBC Television, English commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme was moved to describe hurling as his second favourite sport in the world after his first love, football. Alex Ferguson used footage of an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final in an attempt to motivate his players during his time as manager of Premier League football club Manchester United; the players winced at the standard of physicality and intensity in which the hurlers were engaged. In 2007, Forbes magazine described the media attention and population multiplication of Thurles town ahead of one of the game's annual provincial hurling finals as being \"the rough equivalent of 30 million Americans watching a regional lacrosse game\". Financial Times columnist Simon Kuper wrote after Stephen Bennett's performance in the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final that hurling was \"the best sport ever and if the Irish had colonised the world, nobody would ever have heard of football\"."]}, {"page": "Paul Sturrock", "response": ["Research by football economists Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski found Sturrock to be among the highest performing managers in English football.

Simon Kuper of the Financial Times criticised both Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo as the \"worst\" of the Adventures, being \"poorly drawn\" and \"largely plot-free\". Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Herg\u00e9 had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s of Stanford University, Herg\u00e9 cast the Bolsheviks as \"absolute evil\" but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet \"world of misery\" and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as \"fairly straightforward\" and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as \"pantomime cut-outs\"."]}, {"page": "Eurabia", "response": ["In 2010, German politician Thilo Sarrazin released Germany Abolishes Itself.

He thought that the story began in \"the most inoffensive way\", and that throughout the story Tintin was portrayed as a Boy Scout, something he argued reflected Herg\u00e9's \"moral debt\" to Wallez. Biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters opined that Tintin in the Congo was \"nothing spectacular\", with some \"incredibly cumbersome\" monologues, but he thought the illustrations \"a bit more polished\" than those in Land of the Soviets. Believing the plot to be \"extremely simple\", he thought that Tintin's character was like a child manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines. Michael Farr felt that, unlike the previous Tintin adventure, some sense of a plot emerges at the end of the story with the introduction of the American diamond-smuggling racket. Philippe Goddin thought the work to be \"more exciting\" than Land of the Soviets and argued that Herg\u00e9's depiction of the native Congolese was not mocking but a parody of past European militaries. By contrast, Harry Thompson believed that \"Congo is almost a regression from Soviets\", in his opinion having no plot or characterisation; he described it as \"probably the most childish of all the Tintin books\".

Other analysts are skeptical about the accuracy of the claimed Muslim population growth, stating that because many European countries do not ask a person's religion on official forms or in censuses, it has been difficult to obtain accurate estimates, and arguing that there has been a decrease in Muslim fertility rates in Morocco, the Netherlands and Turkey.Mary Mederios Kent, Do Muslims have more children than other women in western Europe? , Population Reference Bureau, February 2008, Simon Kuper, Head count belies vision of \u2018Eurabia\u2019, Financial Times, 19 August 2007, Doug Saunders, The 'Eurabia' myth deserves a debunking , The Globe and Mail, 20 September 2008, Islam and demography: A waxing crescent, The Economist, 27 January 2011"]}, {"page": "When Saturday Comes", "response": ["While the magazine now employs professional writers (the September 2009 issue credited 15 journalists as being \"regular contributors\")WSC Issue 271, p. 45. it still commissions articles by fans.

After a second appearance in 1938, they did not appear in another World Cup until 1974. As Simon Kuper (in \"Holland, a Country of Clubs\") noted, \"The mere fact that almost everyone in Holland plays football cannot itself explain the country's success. Until the 1970s Dutch football was mediocre.

The Guardian. Retrieved 11 June 2014. After finishing third in UEFA Euro 1976, Cruyff refused to play in the 1978 World Cup after a kidnapping attempt targeting him and his family in their Barcelona home dissuaded him from football. At club level, Cruyff started his career at Ajax, where he won eight Eredivisie titles, three European Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In 1973, he moved to Barcelona for a world record transfer fee, helping the team win La Liga in his first season, and was named European Footballer of the Year. After retiring from playing in 1984, Cruyff became highly successful as manager of Ajax and later Barcelona; he remained an influential advisor to both clubs after his coaching tenures. His son Jordi also played football professionally.", "Regarded by many as Europe's first true football superstar, Cruyff is often mentioned alongside the pair widely considered the finest to have played the game, Pele and Maradona. As a player, he greatly helped turn the previously backward and obscure Dutch football (at both club and international level) into a world-class powerhouse in the 1970s.In the article The Church of Cruyff: Forever Spreading the Football Gospel (8 March 2016), David Winner writes about the state of Dutch football until the mid-1960s, \"the Netherlands was a third-rate footballing nation, its tactics and facilities stuck in the 1930s. Yet within a decade, the club and country had become the most important and admired in the world. Cruyff was the man who made it happen.\" In Simon Kuper's words, \"without Cruyff, Holland [Netherlands] wouldn't have had a footballing tradition.\" Cruyff is always considered to be an indisputable icon in Ajax's history, especially in the club's golden era (1966\u20131973). He was instrumental in Ajax's transformation from a semi-professional club into a dominant force in European club football. Cruyff inspired Ajax to win the European Cup three times in succession at the beginning of the 1970s before moving to Barcelona in 1973 and helping the club win their first La Liga title in 14 years.
