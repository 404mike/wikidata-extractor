He became known to a wider audience as the original bass player in Public Image Ltd (PiL) in the late 1970s and early 1980s; he left the band after two albums. Following his departure from PiL, he developed a solo career. In 2012, he reunited with fellow PiL guitarist Keith Levene for Metal Box in Dub and the album Yin & Yang. Since 2013, he has been one of the featured pundits on Sunday morning's The Virtual Jukebox segment of BBC Radio 5 Live's Up All Night with Dotun Adebayo.

Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the Sex Pistols' management company, Glitterbest, which McLaren controlled. Among the claims were non-payment of royalties, improper usage of the title \"Johnny Rotten\", unfair contractual obligations, and damages for \"all the criminal activities that took place\". In 1979, PiL recorded the post-punk classic Metal Box. Lydon performed with the band through 1992, as well as engaging in other projects such as Time Zone with Afrika Bambaataa and Bill Laswell."]}, {"page": "X-Ray Spex", "response": ["X-Ray Spex's other distinctive musical element was Poly Styrene's voice, which has been variously described as \"effervescently discordant\" and \"powerful enough to drill holes through sheet metal\".  As Mari Elliot, Styrene had released a reggae single for GTO Records in 1976, \"Silly Billy\", which had not charted. Born in 1957 in Bromley, Kent, of both Somali and British parentage, Poly Styrene became the group's public face, and remains one of the most memorable front-women to emerge from the punk movement. Unorthodox in appearance, she wore thick braces on her teeth and once stated that \"I said that I wasn't a sex symbol and that if anybody tried to make me one I'd shave my head tomorrow\". She later actually did at Johnny Rotten's flat prior to a concert at Victoria Park. Mark Paytress recounts in the liner notes for the 2002 compilation, The Anthology, that Jah Wobble, Rotten's longtime friend and bassist for his post-punk venture PiL, once described Styrene as a \"strange girl who often talked of hallucinating. She freaked John out.\"Cinderella's Big Score:  Women of the Punk and Indie Underground by Maria Raha Rotten, known more for his outspoken dislikes and disdain than for praise and admiration, said of X-Ray Spex in a retrospective punk documentary, \"Them, they came out with a sound and attitude and a whole energy\u2014it was just not relating to anything around it\u2014superb.\""]}, {"page": "Post-rock", "response": ["British group Public Image Ltd (PiL) were also pioneers, described by the NME as \"arguably the first post-rock group\".

The year before Metal Box was released, PiL bassist Jah Wobble declared, \"rock is obsolete\". The Flowers of Romance (1981), their third album, was an even more radical departure, emphasizing rattling percussion and abstract tape music.

The group's personnel has changed frequently over the years; Lydon has been the sole constant member.", "Upon returning to England, Lydon approached Jah Wobble (n\u00e9 John Wardle) about forming a band together. The pair had been friends since the early 1970s when they attended the same school in Hackney (both belonged to a circle of friends Lydon informally dubbed \"The Gang of Johns\" \u2013 John Lydon, John Wardle, John Gray, and Simon John Ritchie/Beverley, a.k.a. Sid Vicious). Lydon and Wobble had previously played music together during the final days of the Sex Pistols. Both had similarly broad musical tastes, and were avid fans of reggae and world music. Lydon assumed, much as he had with Sid Vicious, that Wobble would learn to play bass guitar as he went.  Wobble would prove to be a natural talent. Lydon also approached guitarist Keith Levene, with whom he had toured in mid-1976, while Levene was a member of the Clash. Lydon and Levene had both considered themselves outsiders even within their own bands. Jim Walker, a Canadian student newly arrived in the UK, was recruited on drums, after answering an ad placed in Melody Maker.", "1980 also saw the release of PiL's first live album, Paris au Printemps \u2013 also the group's last album featuring Jah Wobble.

The album cover was a painting by John Lydon depicting himself, Keith Levene and Jeannette Lee.", "Later in 1980, Jah Wobble left the band and was not formally replaced. The resulting album was notable for its almost complete lack of bass parts. Martin Atkins, who had initially joined at the tail end of the Metal Box sessions, was re-recruited to drum on The Flowers of Romance. Levene had by then largely abandoned guitar in favour of synthesiser, picking up a new technique although owing a debt to Allen Ravenstine of Pere Ubu. Atkins' propulsive marching band-style drumming, the lack of bass and guitar, and Lydon's increasing lyrical abstraction made this LP a difficult listen for rock fans, and contemporary reviews expressed great confusion. The record consists mostly of drums, vocals, musique concr\u00e8te, and tape loops, with only gestures toward bass (played by Levene) and keyboards. The title \"Flowers of Romance\" was the name of a short-lived band featuring Keith Levene, Viv Albertine, and Sid Vicious in 1976. The track \"Francis Massacre\" was partially inspired by Lydon's incarceration in Mountjoy Prison and the track \"Hymie's Him\" began life as an instrumental piece intended for the score of Michael Wadleigh's 1981 werewolf film Wolfen."]}, {"page": "Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor", "response": ["Collaborations, a compilation album of guest appearances, was released in 2005\u2014featuring tracks recorded with Peter Gabriel, Massive Attack, Jah Wobble, Terry Hall, Moby, Bomb The Bass, The Edge, U2, and The The."]}, {"page": "Fats Domino", "response": ["Jah Wobble, a post-punk bassist best known for his work with Johnny Rotten, released a solo recording of \"Blueberry Hill\"."]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian", "response": ["* Snake Charmer Jah Wobble, The Edge, Holger Czukay, and Jaki Liebezeit (Island Records) 1983"]}, {"page": "Sid Vicious", "response": ["By the time he was 17, Ritchie was hanging around London.

She tried (but failed) to convince Ritchie to join her in a sham marriage so she could get a work permit. John Lydon nicknamed Ritchie \"Sid Vicious\" after Lydon's pet hamster Sid (which was named after Syd Barrett), who had bitten Ritchie, eliciting Ritchie's response: \"Sid is really vicious!\" The animal was described by Lydon as \"the softest, furriest, weediest thing on earth.\" At the time, Ritchie was squatting with Lydon, John Joseph Wardle (Jah Wobble), and John Gray, and the four were familiarly known as \"the Four Johns\".", "According to Lydon, he and Vicious would often busk for money, with Vicious playing the tambourine.

Yet the darker side of Vicious' personality emerged when he assaulted NME journalist Nick Kent with a motorbike chain, with help from Jah Wobble.

Stereolab also covers Roy Budd's theme on their album Aluminum Tunes, although they call their version \"Get Carter\", as opposed to its proper title, \"Main Theme (Carter Takes A Train)\".
