For Worcestershire, he made his debut against the touring South Africans in 1901, but his most notable achievement was to take 6\u201386 on his County Championship debut against Surrey in June 1903, albeit in a game Worcestershire lost by an innings. His first victim was the 45-year-old Bobby Abel, then nearing the end of his long career. Wilson took 4\u201367 against Kent a few days later, but picked up only three more wickets in the rest of his short career.\nWilson's last match was also against Kent, in July 1906; barely a month later he was dead, aged only 32 or 33. He died in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Wilson", "response": ["Harry Wilson may refer to:", "* Harry Wilson (American football coach), coach at Buchtel College, active 1896", "* Harry Wilson (halfback) (1902\u20131990), American football, basketball, and lacrosse player", "* Harry Wilson (hurdler) (1896\u20131979), New Zealand track and field athlete", "* Harry Wilson (Northamptonshire cricketer) (1897\u20131960)", "* Harry Wilson (Worcestershire cricketer) (1873\u20131906)", "* Harry Wilson (rugby league), English rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s and 1900s", "* Harry Wilson (rugby union) (born 1999), Australian rugby union player", "* Harry Wilson (Australian footballer) (1885\u20131972), Australian rules footballer with South Melbourne", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1896), Irish footballer", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1897), English footballer", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1953), English footballer", "* Harry Wilson (footballer, born 1997), Welsh footballer", "* Harry Wilson (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle)", "* Harry Wilson (actor) (1897\u20131978), English-born American character actor", "* Harry Wilson (businessman) (born 1971), member of the auto industry task force, former financial executive", "* Harry Wilson (politician) (1869\u20131948), American politician in Louisiana"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["* Harry Wilson (disambiguation), multiple people", "** Harry Wilson (American football coach), US American football coach", "** Harry Wilson (Louisiana politician) Harry D.
