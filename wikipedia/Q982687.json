He is known primarily for his classification of Bantu languages, Guthrie 1971. The classification, though based more on geography than linguistic relatedness, is nonetheless the most widely used. Together with the Belgian linguist Achille \u00c9mile Meeussen (1912\u20131978), he is regarded as one of the two leading Bantu specialists of the second half of the 20th century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bantu languages", "response": ["The most widely used classification is an alphanumeric coding system developed by Malcolm Guthrie in his 1948 classification of the Bantu languages. It is mainly geographic. The term 'narrow Bantu' was coined by the Benue\u2013Congo Working Group to distinguish Bantu as recognized by Guthrie, from the Bantoid languages not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie."]}, {"page": "Kongo language", "response": ["According to Malcolm Guthrie, Kikongo is in the language group H10, the Kongo languages.

Tessmann in 1932.Hedinger (1984a), pp. 37\u20138. However, the name Mbo properly applies only to dialects in the north and north-east area of the region and is found objectionable by Manenguba speakers from other areas. It therefore seems unsatisfactory as a designation for the languages as a whole.Hedinger (1984a), pp. 38\u20139."]}, {"page": "Jan Knappert", "response": ["Dr. Jan Knappert was Lecturer of Bantu Languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), specializing in Swahili traditional and religious literature. He wrote extensively about the manuscripts he collected and deposited in the SOAS Archives. His most important contributions include Four Centuries of Swahili Verses (1979), Swahili Islamic Poetry (1971), Epic Poetry in Swahili and other African Languages, (1983), A Survey of Swahili Islamic Epic Sagas (1999). He also resided at the University of Dar es Salaam, where he became Secretary of the East African Swahili Committee as well as editor of the journal of the same committee, after the death of W. H. Whiteley, in the 1970s. At SOAS, he worked with the great Africanists Malcolm Guthrie, A. N. Tucker, B. W. Andrzejewski, Gordon Innes, and Ronald Snoxall. In addition to the study of Swahili, Dr Knappert also holds a degree in Sanskrit with Indian history, Hinduism and Buddhism, a degree in Semitic languages with Hebrew, Arabic and Islam, and a Master in Austronesian studies, with Malay, Tagalog, Hawaiian and Malagasy. After teaching at SOAS for a number of years, he moved to Belgium to lecture. After this he retired from the University of Louvain, Belgium, to devote himself entirely to writing."]}, {"page": "Banyarwanda", "response": ["The Banyarwanda, through their language of Kinyarwanda, form a subgroup of the Bantu peoples, who inhabit a geographical area stretching east and southward from Central Africa across the African Great Lakes region down to Southern Africa. Scholars from the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Tervuren, building on earlier work by Malcolm Guthrie, placed Kinyarwanda within the Great Lakes Bantu languages. This classification groups the Banyarwanda with nineteen other ethnic groups including the Barundi, Banyankore, Baganda and Bahunde."]}, {"page": "Guthrie classification of Bantu languages", "response": ["The 250 or so \"Narrow Bantu languages\" are conventionally divided up into geographic zones first proposed by Malcolm Guthrie (1967\u20131971). These were assigned letters A\u2013S and divided into decades (groups A10, A20, etc.); individual languages were assigned unit numbers (A11, A12, etc.), and dialects further subdivided (A11a, A11b, etc.). This coding system has become the standard for identifying Bantu languages; it was the only practical way to distinguish many ambiguously named languages before the introduction of ISO 639-3 coding, and it continues to be widely used. Only Guthrie's Zone S is (sometimes) considered to be a genealogical group. Since Guthrie's time a Zone J (made of languages formerly classified in groups D and E) has been set up as another possible genealogical group bordering the Great Lakes."]}, {"page": "Guthrie (surname)", "response": ["* Malcolm Guthrie (1903\u20131972), British professor of Bantu languages"]}, {"page": "Proto-Bantu language", "response": ["Wilhelm Bleek's reconstruction consisted of sixteen noun prefixes.
