He was educated at Charterhouse School and Caius College, Cambridge.His output during the 1940s included comedian Will Hay's last starring features, and several George Formby films as well as the 1947 adaptation of Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby, and the 1943 war movie Undercover starring John Clements and Michael Wilding.\nIn 1947 Dighton wrote his first play for the theatre, The Happiest Days of Your Life, which ran in the West End for more than 600 performances in 1948 and 1949. For Ealing Studios, he collaborated on the screenplays of such celebrated comedies as Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) and The Man in the White Suit (1952), sharing an Academy Award nomination for the latter. He gained a second nomination for the American-financed Roman Holiday (1953).\nTwo of his more popular stage plays, The Happiest Days of Your Life and Who Goes There! (known as The Passionate Sentry in the USA), were successfully adapted for the screen by Dighton himself, the former in collaboration with Frank Launder. He also wrote the 1955 comedy play Man Alive! that transferred to the West End the following year with Robertson Hare in the lead.\nHe adapted the play Summer of the Seventeenth Doll.His final screen credit was his adaptation of Shaw's The Devil's Disciple, written in collaboration with Roland Kibbee.\nDighton married Kathleen Marie Philipps in 1934.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay", "response": ["| John Dighton, Alexander Mackendrick & Roger MacDougall", "| John Dighton & Ian McLellan Hunter"]}, {"page": "Roman Holiday", "response": ["The script was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him.

Set in Colonial America, the story tells of the American Revolutionary War. Initially planned for a 1956 production, the film was to star Lancaster, Montgomery Clift and Laurence Olivier, with Olivier also directing. But Lancaster decided he didn't want to be directed by another actor.  Plans were delayed and Clift's part was recast with Kirk Douglas and Olivier dropped out from directing. Instead, Alexander Mackendrick was hired as director, but he was later fired shortly after filming began. Mackendrick was replaced by future James Bond director Guy Hamilton. The film was partly shot at the famous Ealing Studios in England, from a script by Roland Kibbee and John Dighton. It also earned a BAFTA Award nomination for Best British Actor (for Olivier). While The Devil's Disciple was shooting in England, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions was simultaneously producing Summer of the Seventeenth Doll in Australia. The film was based on Ray Lawler's successful dramatic play about sugarcane cutters in Australia, but was greatly re-written and Americanized by screenwriter John Dighton. It was directed by Leslie Norman and starred Ernest Borgnine (his final collaboration with Hecht and Lancaster), Anne Baxter, Angela Lansbury and John Mills.

No doubt, the compression of details and incidents compelled by John Dighton's script put Director Cavalcanti on a somewhat unenviable spot, which is evidenced by his failure to get real pace or tension in the film's last half.
