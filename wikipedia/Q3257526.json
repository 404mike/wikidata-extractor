The second fight was more lopsided in Pazienza's favour, as despite the official judges giving Pazienza the win by scores of 116\u2013112, 117\u2013111 and 118\u2013110, the TV commentators expressed puzzlement at the closeness of the official scoring as they thought that Pazienza had won every round in a 120\u2013108 shutout.", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lloyd Honeyghan"]}, {"page": "Donald Curry", "response": ["Curry's next defense of the title was against Lloyd Honeyghan of the United Kingdom on September 27, 1986 in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
