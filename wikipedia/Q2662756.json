Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because \"the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build\", he stated. \"The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature.\" Burton commented, \"Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage\". Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Vin Burnham was tasked with sculpting the Batsuit, in association with Alli Eynon. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit.Bob Ringwood, Tim Burton, Designing the Batsuit, 2005, Warner Home Video Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating. Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson's chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson's contract was approval over the makeup designer.", "Anton Furst and Peter Young won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, while Nicholson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (Musical or Comedy). The British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated Batman in six categories (Production Design, Visual Effects, Costume Design, Makeup, Sound and Actor in a Supporting Role for Nicholson), but it won none of the categories. Nicholson, Basinger, the makeup department, and costume designer Bob Ringwood all received nominations at the Saturn Awards.

This movie suit was notable for its introduction of the grapple gun with a motorized reel (which was later adopted by the comics), for the black eye makeup worn under the mask (which has been used in every live-action Batman film since), and for the construction of the cowl (which made it nearly impossible for Michael Keaton to turn his head while wearing it). The costume was constructed of black kevlar-like material over metal plating (layers of foam-latex over a Neoprene bodysuit in reality, hi-tech body armor in the context of the film), instead of the light-gray spandex seen in the comics and in the 1966 live-action Batman television series. Keaton was told not to put on too much muscle in preparation for the role, as there was uncertainty to how it effect the costume they were sculpting on bodycasts made during the filming of The Dream Team.
