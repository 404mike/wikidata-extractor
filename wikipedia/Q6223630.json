A visit to the constituency by John Bruce Glasier, the chairman of the Independent Labour Party took place on 17 September 1902. Glasier said that if the miners wanted a labour candidate the ILP would assist but that if they decided to combine with the Liberals in support of a progressive representative, (as had traditionally been the case) the ILP would oppose that, raising the prospect of a split in the anti-Tory vote.The Times, 18 September 1902 p5 The Cleveland Miners held a meeting at Middlesbrough on 29 September to discuss their approach. While they were not opposed in principle to supporting a Liberal if a candidate sympathetic to the cause of labour could be found, probably to stand as a Lib-Lab, the officials felt the time had come for labour to be more directly represented. On 23 September, ILP Leader Keir Hardie made a speech at Marske-by-the-Sea and urged the miners and other trade unionists to bring forward their own candidate. Rather hectoringly, he said that if they failed in their obvious duty, the ILP would stand a candidate.The Times, 24 September 1902 p8 The miners resolved to stand their own man and called on the Labour Representation Committee to hold a conference on 11 October to discuss the matter.The Times, 30 September 1902 p9 Despite Keir Hardie\u2019s presence, and the moving of a resolution welcoming the prospect of a labour candidate, reservations were expressed about the timing and cost of standing such a candidate and the conference outcome was inconclusive.The Times, 13 October 1902 p7  There was a call for the Cleveland Miners to take their own vote and a meeting was to be held at Saltburn on 23 October. In the end however no labour candidate of any description was put forward at the by-election. The decision not to put forward a distinctively labour candidate and, in effect to maintain the traditional collaboration with the Liberals upset Keir Hardie and other ILP leaders.
