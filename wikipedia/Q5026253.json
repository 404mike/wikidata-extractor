Richardson Foundation Regents Chair in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin, known for his work in knot theory.  Among his notable results is his work with Marc Culler, John Luecke, and Peter Shalen on the cyclic surgery theorem.  This was an important ingredient in his work with Luecke showing that knots were determined by their complement. Gordon was also involved in the resolution of the Smith conjecture.\nAndrew Casson  and Gordon defined and proved basic theorems regarding strongly irreducible Heegaard splittings, an important concept in the modernization of Heegaard splitting theory. They also worked on the slice-ribbon conjecture, inventing the Casson-Gordon invariants in the process.\nGordon was a 1999 Guggenheim Fellow.\nIn 2005 Gordon was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Figure-eight knot (mathematics)", "response": ["* Robion Kirby, Problems in low-dimensional topology, (see problem 1.77, due to Cameron Gordon, for exceptional slopes)"]}, {"page": "List of conjectures", "response": ["|c.1984||Collective work||Smith conjecture||knot theory||Based on work of William Thurston on hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds, with results by William Meeks and Shing-Tung Yau on minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds, also with Hyman Bass, Cameron Gordon, Peter Shalen, and Rick Litherland, written up by Bass and John Morgan."]}, {"page": "List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1999", "response": ["* Cameron Gordon, Sid W.

Cameron Gordon conjectured that 10 is the largest possible number of exceptional surgeries of any hyperbolic knot complement.  This was proved by Marc Lackenby and Rob Meyerhoff, who show that the number of exceptional slopes is 10 for any compact orientable 3-manifold with boundary a torus and interior finite-volume hyperbolic.  Their proof relies on the proof of the geometrization conjecture originated by Grigori Perelman and on computer assistance.  However, it is not currently known whether the figure-eight knot is the only one that achieves the bound of 10.  A well-known conjecture is that the bound (except for the two knots mentioned) is 6.
