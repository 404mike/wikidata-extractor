She has also written short stories based on the BBC Television series Doctor Who.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "City of Death", "response": ["City of Death was voted into seventh place in a 1998 poll of the readers of Doctor Who Magazine to find the best Doctor Who story; the magazine commented that it \"represented the height of Doctor Who as popular light entertainment for all the family\". In 2009, Doctor Who Magazine readers voted it in eighth place. In a more recent 2014 poll, the magazine's readers voted it fifth best Doctor Who story of all time. A 2008 article in The Daily Telegraph named City of Death one of the ten greatest episodes of Doctor Who. John Condor, writing in the fanzine DWB in 1991, hailed the story as \"the best blend of kitsch, surrealism, fantasy and comedy-drama seen in our favourite Time Lord's annals\".Howe & Walker, The Television Companion, p, 478. Vanessa Bishop, reviewing the serial's DVD release, described it as \"imaginatively written, well-performed and beautifully made, City of Death is a story where pretty much everything works\". Reacting to the serial, as part of Doctor Who Magazines ongoing \"Time Team\" feature, Jacqueline Rayner said \"you're suddenly, almost violently, made aware this is happening in our world... with people just getting on with their business and two Time Lords walking through it. I don't think I've ever experienced that with Doctor Who up till now... it's the tiny touches of mundanity amid the fantastical that lift the story even higher\". Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it on their list of \"10 TV Episodes that Changed Television\", citing \"the sharp dialogue and clever use of time travel [that] prefigure everything Steven Moffat has done with the series in recent years.\" The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn described City of Death as the \"gem\" of the seventeenth season, finding Adams' subtle comedy script \"easily the funniest and most quotable the series ever achieved\". While he praised Scarlioni's costume and the mask, he felt that more could have been done with using Paris as a filming location.", "However, Doctor Who fandom's initial response to the serial was not so positive; John Peel, writing in the fanzine TARDIS in 1979, decried it as \"total farce... I simply couldn't believe this was Doctor Who... the continual buffoonery is getting on my nerves\". A similar view was held by Gary Russell who, reviewing the VHS release in 1991, said, \"City of Death, like most Douglas Adams material, is overrated and misses the mark for me, falling between the stools of good pastiche and bad parody and making fairly unsatisfactory viewing\". This line was countered by Vanessa Bishop who called it \"the Doctor Who story it's alright to laugh at... we must now accept that City of Death is funny\u00a0\u2014 because if we didn't the Crackerjack-style sleuths, scientists and all... would leave it knocking about near the bottom of all the Doctor Who story ranking polls\" and, responding to the criticisms about the levels of comedy, that \"it's precisely these things that make it seem so special\". Reviewing the serial in 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it three stars out of five, stating he disliked the smug tone to the humour and Ward's \"snooty\" portrayal of Romana. Despite this, he noted that the serial had good production values and direction, as well as a few jokes that he enjoyed."]}, {"page": "Doctor Who Magazine", "response": ["The magazine also features interviews with the cast and crew of the television show (including the old episodes), and reports from the set of the current series, written by Benjamin Cook or Jason Arnopp. The behind-the-scenes stories of all of the 1963\u20131989 episodes have been documented in Andrew Pixley's \"DWM Archive\", and detailed analysis of certain significant serials are covered in \"The Fact of Fiction\", usually written by former DWM editor Alan Barnes, Jonathan Morris or David Bailey. \"The DWM Review\" is currently written predominantly by Graham Kibble-White, former editor Gary Gillatt, Paul Kirkley, Martin Ruddock and Matt Michael.
