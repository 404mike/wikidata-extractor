With nearby Devonport and Saltash, Plymouth at this time has been called a notable centre of \"ultra-Evangelicalism\". The conflict was largely fostered by John Hatchard. He was an evangelical, vicar of St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, and son of John Hatchard (1769\u20131849) the publisher. From 1848 he sought to undermine Henry Phillpotts, the bishop of Exeter, attacking William Maskell, domestic chaplain to Phillpotts and involved in the Gorham case. The effect was to suggest Phillpotts was a supporter of the Tractarians. That was a misconstruction of the bishop's wish to stay within a strict interpretation of the rubrics in liturgical matters."]}]}}
