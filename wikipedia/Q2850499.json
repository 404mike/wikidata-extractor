She always has a problem with at least one member of the staff, and complains incessantly, usually prefacing her gripes with \"I\u2019m not one to complain...\".

She was raised by her grandmother, who clearly abused her as a child \u2013 incidents are recounted in which Sally is locked in a rat-infested cellar; or abandoned in a forest, ostensibly to cure her fear of trees.

ITN had presented Ford as their female programme anchor as part of their bid, unaware that she was planning to defect to TV-am.

Ford refused, stating that if she stepped down, it would be too easy for the media to pin the disastrous start to the station on her.
