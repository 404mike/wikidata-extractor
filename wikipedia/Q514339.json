In 1911, the family lived in Salford, Lancashire.\nShe appeared as Maggie Hobson in the David Lean film version of Hobson's Choice (1954) with John Mills and Charles Laughton, set in Salford. Laughton allegedly didn't like de Banzie, because she wasn't getting 'her part right'. De Banzie also upstaged Laughton who was, by all accounts, a notorious upstager himself.Her most notable film role was as Phoebe Rice, the hapless wife of comedian Archie Rice (played by Laurence Olivier) in the 1960 film version of John Osborne's The Entertainer. She had also appeared on Broadway in the original play, for which she received a Tony Award nomination.\nOther memorable film roles included The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and The Pink Panther (1963) directed by Blake Edwards.\nDe Banzie died at the age of 71 due to complications following brain surgery. She was the aunt of actress Lois de Banzie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Mark (1961 film)", "response": ["The Mark is a 1961 film which tells the story of a convicted child molester, now out of prison, who is suspected in the molestation and beating of another child.
