He has appeared in multiple episodes of the documentary series Closer to Truth.  During his long career, he has taught at Oxford University, Cambridge University, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anti-realism", "response": ["Just as moral anti-realism asserts the nonexistence of normative facts, epistemic anti-realism asserts the nonexistence of facts in the domain of epistemology.

Prominent defenders of epistemic anti-realism include Hartry Field, Simon Blackburn, Matthew Chrisman, and Allan Gibbard, among others."]}, {"page": "Axiology", "response": ["The preceding discussion about the ontological categories of values and value-bearers assumes some form of realism: that there actually are valuable things. But the difficulties in reaching expert consensus in value-related fields like ethics, aesthetics or politics and considerations from naturalism have led various philosophers to doubt this assumption. The ensuing dispute between cognitivists and non-cognitivists is usually held on the level of value-statements or value-attitudes, either concerning all values or specifically concerning ethical values. Cognitivists assert that value-statements are truth-apt, i.e. are either true or false, which is denied by non-cognitivists. Most cognitivists are realists about values: they believe that values are part of reality. Error theory, as originally articulated by J. L. Mackie, is an exception. Error theorists hold that all value-statements are false, and thereby truth-apt, because the world lacks value-features that would be needed to make them true. Non-cognitivists, on the other hand, go one step further by denying that value-statements are truth-apt. This position involves the difficulty of explaining how value-statements can be meaningful despite lacking a truth value. This challenge can be met in different ways. Emotivists, following A. J. Ayer, state that value-statements only express the emotions of the speaker and are intended to influence the actions of the listener. Prescriptivism, as developed by R. M. Hare, interprets value-statements as imperatives or commands. Simon Blackburn's quasi-realism states that value statements project emotional attitudes as though they were real properties."]}, {"page": "Cogito, ergo sum", "response": ["Following John Lyons (1982), Vladimir \u017degarac notes, \"The temptation to use the simple present is said to arise from the lack of progressive forms in Latin and French, and from a misinterpretation of the meaning of cogito as habitual or generic\" (cf. gnomic aspect).

Allan Gibbard, R. M. Hare, and Simon Blackburn have argued in favor of the fact/norm distinction, meanwhile, with Gibbard going so far as to argue that, even if conventional English has only mixed normative terms (that is, terms that are neither purely descriptive nor purely normative), we could develop a nominally English metalanguage that still allowed us to maintain the division between factual descriptions and normative evaluations.Couture, Jocelyne, and Kai Nielsen. 1995. \"Introduction: The Ages of Metaethics.\" Pp. 1\u201330 in On the Relevance of Metaethics: New Essays in Metaethics, edited by J.

The role of dialectic in Plato's thought is contested but there are two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition. Simon Blackburn adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is \"the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position.\" A similar interpretation has been put forth by Louis Hartz, who compares Plato's dialectic to that of Hegel.Hartz, Louis. 1984. A Synthesis of World History. Zurich: Humanity Press According to this view, opposing arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time. Each new idea exposes a flaw in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate continually approaches the truth. Hartz's is a teleological interpretation at the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of knowledge and thus reach \"the end of history.\" Karl Popper, on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for \"visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances.\""]}, {"page": "Structuralism", "response": ["Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn, structuralism is:Blackburn, Simon, ed. 2008. \"Structuralism.\" In Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (2nd rev. ed.).

In regard to Christianity, he states that the \"Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women\", and notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's New Testament as well. Elizabeth Anderson likewise holds that \"the Bible contains both good and evil teachings\", and it is \"morally inconsistent\".Elizabeth Anderson, \"If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?\" In  Christian apologists address Blackburn's viewpoints and construe that Jewish laws in the Hebrew Bible showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not property.

Blackburn writes that he finished Polkinghorne's books in \"despair at humanity's capacity for self-deception.\" Against this, Freeman Dyson called Polkinghorne's arguments on theology and natural science \"polished and logically coherent.\" The novelist Simon Ings, writing in the New Scientist, said Polkinghorne's argument for the proposition that God is real is cogent and his evidence elegant."]}, {"page": "Hilary Putnam", "response": ["Putnam renounced internal realism in his reply to Simon Blackburn in the volume Reading Putnam.Peter Clark and Bob Hale, eds., Reading Putnam.

If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous.

Witnesses to the Influence of Tertullian. (or, Who had read what?) Link however, the maxim first began to receive attention and then undergo change during the early modern era. In 1521, the humanist scholar Beatus Rhenanus produced an edition of Tertullian's De carne Christi.Beatus Rhenanus, ed., Tertullianus Quintus Septiuius Florens Opera (Basel, 1521) The only French translation of this work to appear in the 17th century was Louis Giry's 1661 edition.Louis Giry, trans., De la Chair de J\u00e9sus-Christ, et de la R\u00e9surrection de la chair, ouvrages de Tertullien (Paris, 1661). According to Peter Harrison, the first time that the maxim was quoted was in Thomas Browne's highly influential religious classic Religio Medici (The Religion of a Doctor), ensuring that the maxim received a wide audience at this time, and Browne also shifted the context of Tertullian's phrase from a discourse against Marcion to personal faith, and also shifted the wording of the phrase from its original certum est, quia impossibile (\"It is certain, because it is impossible\") to \"I believe, because it is impossible.\" Many of Browne's contemporaries criticized him and Tertullian for this maxim, including Henry More, Edward Stillingfleet, Robert Boyle, and John Locke. As Protestant anti-Catholic polemic and rhetoric grew, many writers began associating certain Catholic doctrines (and later broadly to Christianity itself by some other writers), especially transubstantiation, with this maxim. The maxim was then brought to a French audience through Pierre Bayle's highly influential 1697 Dictionnaire Historique et Critique, which catalogued controversies of philosophical and religious nature as well as historical events and persons related to them. Then Voltaire, in his anonymously published Le D\u00eener du comte de Boulainvillier (1767), took the maxim to the next step and shifted the phrase from \"I believe because it is impossible\" to \"I believe because it is absurd\". Voltaire also attributed it to Augustine instead of Tertullian, a much more central figure in Christian history.[Voltaire], Le D\u00eener du comte de Boulainvilliers par Mr. St. Hyacinte (Amsterdam, 1767), 18: \u201cC\u2019est pourtant ce ridicule que St. Augustin a trouv\u00e9 divin; il disoit, je le crois parce que cela est absurd, je le crois parce que cela est impossible.\u201d (It is, however, this very ridicule that Augustine thought divine. He said: I believe because it is absurd, I believe because it is impossible). The maxim would continue to be attributed to Augustine until Gaston de Flotte noted the original Latin and misattribution by Voltaire, however, the rhetorical appeal of the maxim was great enough that it continued to be widely used, even to the present day, including being used by figures like Sigmund Freud, Ernst Cassirer, Max Weber, Richard Dawkins, Jerry Coyne and even Simon Blackburn's Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy.Harrison, Peter.
