Developed from the foundations of interpersonal communication and symbolic interactionism, social presence theory was first formally introduced by John Short, Ederyn Williams, and Bruce Christie in The Social Psychology of Telecommunications. Research on social presence theory has recently developed to examine the efficacy of telecommunications media, including SNS communications. The theory notes that computer-based communication is lower in social presence than face-to-face communication, but different computer-based communications can affect the levels of social presence between communicators and receivers.", "On a continuum of social presence, the face-to-face medium is considered to have the most social presence; and written, text-based communication the least.Biocca, Harms, & Burgoon 2003. Inter-party and interpersonal exchanges are two aspects of interactions identified by Short, Williams, and Christie. It is assumed in Social Presence Theory that in any interaction involving two parties, both parties are concerned with acting out certain roles and developing or maintaining some sort of personal relationship.Short, John, Ederyn Williams, and Bruce Christie 1976.", "*Ederyn Williams "]}, {"page": "Queen's Award for Enterprise Promotion", "response": ["* Ederyn Williams, director, Warwick Ventures, University of Warwick, Coventry, Warwickshire."]}]}}
