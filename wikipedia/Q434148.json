A number of characters in the novel have names that sound like the words for their personality traits, and some characters' names serve as allusions. Hawkes opted to convey the communicative function of characters' names rather than prioritizing lexical equivalence; for example, Huo Qi is homonymous with \"the beginning of catastrophe\", and Hawkes makes \"Calamity\" the English name for that character. The translator sometimes uses Italian/Sanskrit terms when Western Christian culture lacks a term for a concept.
