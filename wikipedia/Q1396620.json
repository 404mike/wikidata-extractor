The grid featured wide parallel streets, spanning a gently sloping valley between hills (Batman's Hill, Flagstaff Hill and Eastern Hill) and roughly parallel to the course of the Yarra River. The deliberate exclusion of city squares or open space within the grid was a subject of future frustration for the municipality and residents Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, in the centre of the grid, was built over a gully and has therefore been prone to flooding. Despite a later extension and later inclusion of planned suburbs, Melbourne's original plans were not as extensive as Adelaide's, and the city rapidly outgrew its original boundaries. As such, it is often not considered to be a planned city, but the grid continues to define much of the character of the Melbourne city centre."]}, {"page": "Robert Lowe", "response": ["In 1841 Lowe moved to London to read for the Bar, but his eyesight showed signs of serious weakness, and, acting on medical advice, he sailed to Sydney in the colony of New South Wales, where he set to work in the law courts. On 7 November 1843 he was nominated by Sir George Gipps, the Governor of New South Wales, to a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council replacing Robert Jones who had to resign from the Council due to insolvency. Owing to a difference of opinion with Gipps, Lowe resigned from the Council on 9 September 1844, but was elected in April 1845 for Counties of St Vincent and Auckland. Lowe held that seat until 20 June 1848 and was elected for City of Sydney in July 1848, a seat he held until November 1849. Lowe soon made his mark in the political world by his clever speeches, particularly on finance and education; and besides obtaining a large legal practice, he was involved with the founding and was one of the principal writers for the Atlas newspaper."]}, {"page": "Gippsland", "response": ["During his expedition to the South (December 1839 - May 1840) in March 1840, Polish explorer Pawe\u0142 Edmund Strzelecki led an expedition across Gunai country, and gave his own names to many of their natural landmarks and places.

In January and February 1840 both New South Wales Governor George Gipps and Hobson in New Zealand issued proclamations that all land previously purchased from M\u0101ori would have to be confirmed by government title, and that any future direct purchases from M\u0101ori were null and void.Peter Adams, Fatal Necessity, Auckland University Press, 1977, chapter 6."]}, {"page": "Pawe\u0142 Strzelecki", "response": ["His main interest was the mineralogy of Australia.
