Everton opened their first match in the group stage with a 4\u20130 home victory against AEK Athens. Everton then continued their perfect start to the group stage with a 2\u20131, come-from-behind victory over BATE Borisov, with goals from Marouane Fellaini and Tim Cahill cancelling out Dzmitry Likhtarovich's 16th-minute opener. The Toffees, heavily depleted by injuries, were handed their first loss of Europa League play in their third Group Stage match away to Benfica, losing 5\u20130, the worst defeat Everton had ever suffered during European play. This loss was followed a fortnight later by a second loss to Benfica in Everton's home tie, the scoreline ending 2\u20130 and goals coming from Javier Saviola and \u00d3scar Cardozo, who each had already scored two goals apiece in Benfica's previous win over Everton. In their next match, Everton travelled to Athens to play AEK Athens, winning the match 1\u20130 thanks to Bilyaletdinov's 6th-minute goal. The win allowed Everton to qualify for the knockout stage with one group stage game to spare thanks to Benfica's victory away to BATE. The win, however, was somewhat soured by injuries suffered by J\u00f4, Sylvain Distin and Dan Gosling. In the Toffees' final group stage match, with several senior starters injured and the club having already secured passage into the knockout rounds, David Moyes fielded a young side against BATE. In all, seven teenagers saw action on the evening, including five who received their first senior cap. In the match, two Everton records were set: Tony Hibbert set the club record for European caps with 20, and Jake Bidwell set the record for youngest senior cap in European play at only 16 years and 271 days. BATE was able to control possession for much of the match and came away as victors in their final European match of the season."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["* Academy Player of the Season - Jake Bidwell"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Premier Academy League", "response": ["| ||4 || Jake Bidwell (c)"]}, {"page": "Stuart Dallas", "response": ["On 26 June 2014, Dallas signed a new three-year contract, potentially keeping him at Griffin Park until the summer of 2017. He scored his first goal of the 2014\u201315 season on his second appearance of the campaign, scoring two goals in the opening ten minutes of a League Cup first round shootout victory over Dagenham & Redbridge, which finished 6\u20136 after extra time, equalling the record number of goals scored in a League Cup match. He also converted Brentford's first penalty in the shootout. Dallas scored his first league goal of the season on 19 August 2014, bagging the winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Blackpool. A quadriceps injury suffered in a 3\u20130 defeat to Norwich City on 16 September ended Dallas' fine start to the 2014\u201315 season. He made his comeback from injury on 1 November against Derby County, replacing Jon Toral after 66 minutes. With the score at 1\u20131, he scored his fourth goal of the season with a dramatic 93rd-minute winner. In the following game, Dallas was pressed into service as an emergency right-back for the final 25 minutes of a 3\u20131 win over Nottingham Forest, having replaced the injured Moses Odubajo. He later deputised on the opposite flank for the suspended Jake Bidwell in February 2015. Dallas netted his sixth goal of the season with the only goal of the game versus Rotherham United on 10 January 2015, a performance which established him in the starting lineup. After nearly four months without a goal, Dallas scored twice in the Bees' 4\u20131 win over bitter rivals Fulham at Craven Cottage on 3 April. His second strike later won the club's Goal of the Season award. He failed to score again during the season, which ended in defeat to Middlesbrough in the playoff semi-finals. Dallas made 44 appearances and scored eight goals during the 2014\u201315 season. On 31 July 2015, the Yorkshire Evening Post reported that Brentford had accepted a bid for Dallas of over \u00a31m from fellow Championship side Leeds United. On 1 August 2015, new Brentford Head Coach Marinus Dijkhuizen revealed that Dallas did not want to sign a new contract at Brentford with a year remaining of his current contract and that he was likely to leave the club."]}, {"page": "Everton F.C.
