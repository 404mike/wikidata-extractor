Beard has since said that \"Newnham could do better in making itself a place where critical issues can be generated\" and has also described her views on feminism, saying \"I actually can't understand what it would be to be a woman without being a feminist.\" Beard has cited Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch, Kate Millett's Sexual Politics, and Robert Munsch\u2019s The Paper Bag Princess as influential on the development of her personal feminism."]}, {"page": "Brent Shaw", "response": ["Shaw received his B.A. and  M.A. from the University of Alberta in 1968 and 1971 respectively.
