He is best known for his pacific stewardship of Britain's external relations, 1870\u201374 and 1880\u201385, in co-operation with his best friend, Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone.

The British won decisively, and although they repeatedly promised to depart in a few years, the actual result was British control of Egypt for four decades, largely ignoring Ottoman nominal ownership. France was seriously unhappy, having lost control of the canal that it built and financed and had dreamed of for decades. Gladstone's role in the decision to invade was described as relatively hands-off, and the ultimate responsibility was borne by certain members of his cabinet such as Lord Hartington, Secretary of State for India, Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, First Lord of the Admiralty, Hugh Childers, Secretary of State for War, and Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, the Foreign Secretary.Shannon, Gladstone 2: 298\u2013307"]}, {"page": "University of London", "response": ["* Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, 1856\u20131891"]}]}}
