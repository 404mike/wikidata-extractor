He was re-elected unopposed as the Irish Parliamentary Party MP at the 1900 general election.\nHe resigned in February 1902, owing chiefly to the refusal of the party leaders to publish the names of those members who were receiving payment from the Parliamentary fund and those who were not.The subsequent by-election was won unopposed by John McKean of the Irish Parliamentary Party.", "link_mentions": {}}}
