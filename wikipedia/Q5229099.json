He spent the next four years at the club, also enjoying a brief loan spell at Cardiff City. He signed with Stoke City in February 1990 and broke into the first-team in the 1991\u201392 season following a short loan spell at Maidstone United the previous season. He helped Stoke to win the Football League Trophy in 1992 and then the Second Division title in 1992\u201393, before he ended his career at Bournemouth in 1994.

The League also stated that public disclosure of their ownership structure was a \"matter for the club\". McParland parted company with the club in October 2009 with Notts fifth in League Two and 4 points from the top of the table; youth team manager Michael Johnson and assistant manager Dave Kevan were installed as joint caretaker managers..", "|align=left|Dave Kevan /Michael Johnson  (Caretakers)", "|align=left|Dave Kevan (Caretaker)"]}, {"page": "Alan Ball Jr.", "response": ["The following month he joined Colchester United as assistant to Jock Wallace and in October 1989 took up a similar post under Mick Mills at Stoke City. However, Mills was sacked two weeks later and Ball was promoted to the manager's seat. He came to the conclusion that the squad he had inherited was simply not good enough and out went Chris Kamara, Dave Bamber, Leigh Palin, Carl Saunders, Gary Hackett and Nicky Morgan. Into the side came Tony Ellis, Lee Sandford, Tony Kelly, Dave Kevan, Paul Barnes and Noel Blake. It was a big gamble by Ball to change so much of the squad so quickly, and it did not pay off. Stoke stayed rooted to the bottom of the table and was relegated to the Third Division for the first time in 63 years."]}, {"page": "Lee Hughes", "response": ["Describing Hughes's attributes in January 2013, former Notts County coach Dave Kevan said that he was a \"fantastic finisher... a clever player whose movement is good, whose intelligence is good, who uses his body well and who uses his strength well... he plays with his brain and he's adapted his game as he has got older... he's also clever enough to create opportunities for others\". He maintained a \"natural goalscoring instinct\" throughout his career, and has said \"I always fancy myself to stick the ball in the back of the net if I get a chance\". His dancing goal celebration originated as a mocking tribute of a friend's bad dancing."]}, {"page": "Frank Sinclair", "response": ["Sinclair began working as Stoke City's under-23 assistant manager in December 2016. He joined Radcliffe as assistant to manager Jon Macken in September 2017. He began coaching at Port Vale in March 2020, following an invite from assistant manager Dave Kevan. He was appointed as the club's head of coaching development five months later, saying that \"I see a key part of my role as bridging the gap between the younger players and the first team\". Interim manager Danny Pugh had to start self-isolation after testing positive for COVID-19 on 18 January 2021, leaving Sinclair, Billy Paynter and Anthony Griffith to take over first-team duties in his absence. The team lost both games in Pugh's absence, much to Sinclair's frustration. Sinclair left Vale Park at the end of the 2020\u201321 season. He joined Doncaster Rovers as an academy coach in October 2021."]}, {"page": "Wayne Thomas (footballer, born 1979)", "response": ["After a short spell under the caretaker manager, Dave Kevan, Tony Pulis became the new manager of Stoke. Thomas' career flourished under Pulis and so, with his contract running out in the summer of 2005, several Championship clubs were looking to sign him on a free transfer after he stated that he was unhappy with Stoke taking too long to offer him a new contract."]}, {"page": "Michael Johnson (footballer, born 1973)", "response": ["When Notts County sacked manager Ian McParland, Johnson took over briefly as caretaker manager alongside Dave Kevan. During their brief spell at County, they drew against Rotherham United and beat Crewe Alexandra 2\u20130. When Notts County brought in Hans Backe as manager, Johnson returned to his role as the Youth team Manager. A succession of managers came and went over a short period of time, however Johnson was dismissed when Paul Ince was sacked and replaced by Martin Allen."]}]}}
