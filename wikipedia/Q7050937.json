During her career she was recognised internationally as a pioneer and one of Britain's most distinguished and highly respected molecular geneticists. Until her 2001 retirement she held a personal chair in molecular genetics at the University of Edinburgh. She was president of the Genetical Society, vice president of the Royal Society, and a member of the UK Science and Technology Honours Committee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Birmingham", "response": ["Alumni in academia include: University Vice-Chancellors Frank Horton, Sir Robert Howson Pickard, Sir Louis Matheson, Derek Burke, Sir Alex Jarratt, Sir Philip Baxter, Vincent Watts, P.

The medal is targeted at \"emerging early to mid career stage scientist[s]\" and is accompanied by a \u00a32000 prize (since 2017, earlier \u00a31000).
