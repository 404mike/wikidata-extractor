After apprenticing with Freeborn for four years, Dudman was asked to head up the English makeup laboratory for Ridley Scott's Legend. He subsequently worked on the makeup and prosthetics for such films as Mona Lisa, Labyrinth, Willow, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Batman, Alien 3 and Interview with the Vampire, among others.\nIn 1995, Dudman's career path widened into animatronics and large-scale creature effects when he was asked to oversee the 55-man creature department for the Luc Besson film The Fifth Element, for which he won a BAFTA Award for Visual Effects. Since then, he has led the creatures/make-up effects departments on several blockbusters, including Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and consulted on the Costume effects for Batman Begins. Dudman designed the animatronics for Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men.\nIn 2007, he was awarded the Genie Award for Best Makeup by the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television for his work on Beowulf and Grendel. In 2013 Dudman was made an honorary fellow of Arts University Bournemouth.

Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth, and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls. Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted In & Out. A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis (who played the part of the Ewok Wicket W. Warrick in Return of the Jedi in 1983) portrays him in the scene where Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight. Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough at the time. Beginning with the 2011 Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda replaced the puppet entirely.", "Lucas originally planned to create many of the aliens with computer graphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimodians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI."]}, {"page": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", "response": ["Spielberg wanted Donovan's death shown in one shot, so it would not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's forehead and cheeks by Nick Dudman that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan created by Stephan Dupuis in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling", "response": ["| Nick Dudman, Amanda Knight, and Lisa Tomblin"]}, {"page": "The Fifth Element", "response": ["Three different teams handled the three different types of special effects used in the film.

Each suit came with variations for stunt moves or pyrotechnics. After principal photography, the suits were sent to ILM to scan and be modeled in the computer. Using parts of the Imhotep mummy to save time, ILM recreated the underlings digitally to add into the scenes, and used motion capture to animate them. The animators credited Fraser's ability to consistently re-enact his movements in multiple takes as saving time when it came to match the motion-captured digital mummies to the live-action fight scenes."]}, {"page": "Saturn Award for Best Make-up", "response": ["| Paul Engelen, Lynda Armstrong and Nick Dudman", "| Nick Dudman, Chris Cunningham", "|style=\"background:#ddddff\"|Nick Dudman and Aileen Seaton", "| Paul Engelen, Sue Love and Nick Dudman", "| Nick Dudman, Mark Coulier and John Lambert", "| Aileen Seaton, Nick Dudman and Jane Walker", "| Nick Dudman and Amanda Knight", "| Nick Dudman and Amanda Knight", "| Nick Dudman and Amanda Knight", "| Nick Dudman and Amanda Knight", "| Mark Coulier, Nick Dudman and Amanda Knight", "| Nick Dudman and Amanda Knight"]}, {"page": "Warner Bros.

Fortuna involved the first prosthetic makeup Dudman worked upon. Michael Carter, the actor who portrayed Fortuna, spent three months undergoing extensive makeup casts and tests for the character at Elstree Studios before shooting began. Molds were made from his hands and head. Several foam appliances were sculpted to conform to Carter's face, and molds were made and cast into foam latex, which were then trimmed and carefully glued to the actor's face. It took about eight-and-a-half hours to apply the makeup to Carter the first time, though the process was eventually reduced to slightly under an hour. Carter had been told a great deal of makeup would be involved with the part, but he said: \"I did not know what I was letting myself in for when it came to having to wear so much makeup.
