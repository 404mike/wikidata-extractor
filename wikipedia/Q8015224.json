The potential application to photography inspired Edward Sonstadt to investigate methods of manufacturing magnesium so that it would burn reliably for this use. He applied for patents in 1862 and by 1864 had started the Manchester Magnesium Company with Edward Mellor. With the help of engineer William Mather, who was also a director of the company, they produced flat magnesium ribbon, which was said to burn more consistently and completely so giving better illumination than round wire. It also had the benefit of being a simpler and cheaper process than making round wire. Mather was also credited with the invention of a holder for the ribbon, which formed a lamp to burn it in. A variety of magnesium ribbon holders were produced by other manufacturers, such as the Pistol Flashmeter,  which incorporated an inscribed ruler that allowed the photographer to use the correct length of ribbon for the exposure they needed. The packaging also implies that the magnesium ribbon was not necessarily broken off before being ignited."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1910\u20131936)", "response": ["*Sir William Mather (1838\u20131920)"]}, {"page": "John Gambril Nicholson", "response": ["Nicholson's first book of poems Love in Earnest (1892) was dedicated to the memory of his mother, but the first section, a sequence of 50 numbered sonnets (which open with \"Some lightly love, but mine is Love in Earnest -/My heart is ever faithful while it hears/An echo of itself in thine, though years/Should pass ere its full passion thou returnest\"), was dedicated to \"W.E.M.\" This was the flaxen-haired blue-eyed William Ernest Mather (1877\u201399)\u2014second son of Sir William Mather\u2014a pupil of his at Rydal Mount School 1888\u201390, who died young after being thrown from his horse.Manchester Guardian 6 November 1899 A photograph of Nicholson with Ernest, taken at Llandudno in June 1889, was published in The Book Collector (Summer 1978)."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Mather"]}, {"page": "Manchester Gorton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|William Mather"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Mather "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Mather"]}, {"page": "Rossendale (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1900 by-election|| Sir William Mather || Liberal", "thumb|120px|William Mather"]}, {"page": "Salford South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Mather"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Sir William Mather"]}, {"page": "Princeton University Chapel", "response": ["On the western end of the chapel is the narthex, which has entrances on the north, west, and south walls.
