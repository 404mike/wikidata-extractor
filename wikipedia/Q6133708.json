Reed (45), immigrated from Ireland with his widowed mother during childhood, and moved to Illinois in the 1820s. He was accompanied on the journey by his wife Margret (32), step-daughter Virginia (13), daughter Martha Jane (\"Patty\", 8), sons James and Thomas (5 and 3), and Sarah Keyes, Margret Reed's mother. Keyes was in the advanced stages of consumption (tuberculosis)Johnson, p. 181. and died at a campsite they named Alcove Springs.

In addition to leaving financial worries behind, Reed hoped that California's climate would help Margret, who had long suffered from ill health. The Reeds hired three men to drive the ox teams: Milford (\"Milt\") Elliott (28), James Smith (25), and Walter Herron (25). Baylis Williams (24) went along as handyman and his sister, Eliza (25), as the family's cook.Dixon, p. 21.", "James F. Reed made it out of the Sierra Nevada to Rancho Johnson in late October. He was safe and recovering at Sutter's Fort, but each day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel John C. Fr\u00e9mont to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company. In return Reed promised to join Fr\u00e9mont's forces and fight in the Mexican\u2013American War.Johnson, p. 193. He was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan-Young party. The Harlan-Young wagon train had arrived at Sutter's Fort on October 8, the last to make it over the Sierra Nevada that season.Rehart, p. 133. The party of roughly 30\u00a0horses and a dozen men carried food supplies, and expected to find the Donner Party on the western side of the mountain, along the Bear River below the steep approach to Emigrant Gap, perhaps starving but alive. When they arrived in the river valley, they found only a pioneer couple, migrants who had been separated from their company who were near starvation.Stewart, pp. 95\u2013100.McGlashan, pp. 122\u2013123."]}, {"page": "List of people from Illinois", "response": ["*James F.

Members of the fourth relief party spread shocking and gruesome tales about Keseberg which involved some exaggeration, and this image of Keseberg held sway in common lore.

Keseberg won in court, but was only awarded one dollar. He was never charged for any crimes. Eddy did attempt to follow up on his promise to find and kill Keseberg, but was persuaded otherwise by fellow survivor James F. Reed. "]}]}}
