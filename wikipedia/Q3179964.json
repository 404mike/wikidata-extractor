A striker, he scored 135 goals in 361 league and cup games in a 14-year career in the English Football League.\nStarting his career with Newcastle United in 1984, he failed to break into the first team and moved on to Swansea City three years later. After a season with the Swans he signed with Hartlepool United. After scoring 50 league goals for the club he transferred to Chelsea in 1991. After a season with Chelsea, including a loan spell with Port Vale, he joined Brentford. In 1994, he moved back to Port Vale permanently, before moving back to Hartlepool United via Lincoln City in 1995. He retired in 1998 because of a knee injury. He won three promotions with three clubs, and was voted onto the Fourth Division PFA Team of the Year in 1990\u201391 and won the North-East Footballer of the Year award in 1990-91. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Gascoigne", "response": ["Gascoigne captained Newcastle United's youth team to the FA Youth Cup in the 1984\u201385 season, and scored twice in the 4\u20131 victory over Watford in the final at Vicarage Road. In the first leg of the final, they drew 0\u20130. Teammate Joe Allon stated that Newcastle were unusually poor in the first leg, but in the second leg, Gascoigne was instrumental in Newcastle's victory. After the match, Jack Charlton told Gascoigne he would be in the first-team the next day against Norwich City. Gascoigne did travel to Norwich, though Charlton chose not to pick him. Gascoigne made his first-team debut as a substitute for George Reilly in a 1\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers on 13 April 1985 at St James' Park. Charlton later noted that Gascoigne's first-team appearances under him were too brief to suggest he was more than a useful talent. At the age of 18 Gascoigne signed a two-year \u00a3120 a week contract at Newcastle, with the club also having a further two-year option clause. Through noting Gascoigne's generous personality, Charlton arranged that around half of Gascoigne's wage be paid into a bank account for him to collect in a lump sum at the end of his first contract."]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Even better was to follow the next season.

Under Murray, the team's form improved further and the club went into the final day of the season as one of several clubs that could win not just promotion but the title. A 3\u20131 win over Northampton Town was enough to secure promotion in third place; Allon scored 35 goals, and Baker and Paul Dalton also reached double figures.", "*Most goals in a season: 28 Joe Allon (1990\u201391)", "* 1990\u201391  Joe Allon"]}, {"page": "Keith Houchen", "response": ["The 1995\u201396 season was to be his only full season as a manager.
