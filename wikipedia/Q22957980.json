Boland has written widely on specifically feminist themes and on the difficulties faced by women poets in a male-dominated literary world. N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in's poetry shows her interest variously in explorations of the sacred, women's experience, and Reformation history. She has also translated poetry from a number of languages. Higgins is an unconventional poet whose work confronts social injustices."]}, {"page": "List of Irish poets", "response": ["* Kate Newmann (born 1965, E)"]}, {"page": "List of Irish women writers", "response": ["*Kate Newmann (born 1965), poet and small press founder"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Kate Newmann (b. 1965, Ireland), poet"]}]}}
