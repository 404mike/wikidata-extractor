The Tempest gave Bannister a famous role as Caliban: 'Combining, as he did, a deep and sonorous voice both in speaking and singing, a large and vigorous person, and great force in the management of all his advantages, Charles Bannister was an exact and stupendous representative of this hag-born monster; no contemporary or successor has given so perfect a delineation. It is impossible to exceed the vigour with which he ejaculated his curses, the humility with which he worshipped the \"brave god who carried the bottle\", or the appalling revelry with which he made the stage tremble under him, when he shouted \"Freedom! hey-day! liberty! freedom!\" and thundered out his song,\"Ban, ban, Ca-Caliban, Has a new master, get a new man\".'Adolphus 1839, Vol. 1 p. 397. 'With Charles Bannister, Shakspeare's monster died.'Adolphus 1839, Vol. 2 p. 124.", "Charles Bannister was much celebrated as a wit. He possessed, 'in high perfection, the faculty of repartee, unimpaired by any display of spleen or malevolence: his hits were therefore always well received. He was, at this time, eminently in favour with the public, upon whom his truly English style of singing and acting had made a powerful impression; he was greatly esteemed in all convivial and social circles, where his never-failing good humour and versatile talent occasioned his company to be generally courted, and among whom his affability, candour and plain integrity procured him the title of \"Honest Charles Bannister\".'Adolphus 1839, Vol. 1 p. 7.

Another example: 'Bannister repeats \u2013 or has invented \u2013 a very witty thing said by Jack Ketch as he was tying the halter. A culprit asked him \"if he had any commands to the other world.\" \"Why,\" said Jack, \"not much \u2013 I'll \u2013 only -\" (added he, as he adjusted the knot under his left ear) \"just \u2013 trouble you \u2013 WITH A LINE\".'Charles Dibdin, The Musical Tour of Mr Dibdin; in which, previous to his embarkation to India, he finished his career as a public character (Author, J. Gales, Sheffield 1788), Letter XXXVII, p. 148, n. The theatrical memoirs of the period are laced with examples of Bannister's quips and rejoinders: he seems to have been unstoppable.", ":\"This is one of the meritorious houses which have risen progressively from the obscurity of a chop-house to the importance of a tavern. If report may be credited, it owes its first rise to an accidental circumstance. The late Charles Bannister, of facetious memory, having, for some time, occasionally used the house, and by his wit and inexhaustible humour, attracted a crowd of company, the honest host thought fit to fix this magnet by crying quits for bed and board as long as Mr. Bannister continued his guest. The terms we believe were accepted, and the contract terminated only with the life of the comedian.\"", "Bannister died on 26 October 1804, after a period of illness which had kept him from the stage.  In his last weeks there were several benefit performances for him, for which the managers of both principal theatres allowed their leading actors to participate without charge.
