He made over 100 appearances in the top two divisions of the Football League for Birmingham City, playing his part in the Second Division championship-winning side of 1948, and also played for Northampton Town.Duckhouse was born in Shelfield, near Walsall in Staffordshire. He began his football career with works teams before joining West Bromwich Albion and then Birmingham as an amateur. He turned professional with Birmingham in 1938. His career was badly disrupted by the Second World War, but he did help Birmingham to reach the semifinal of the first post-war FA Cup, in which they played Derby County. The tie went to a replay, and remained goalless after 90 minutes; after five minutes of extra time, Duckhouse broke his leg colliding with Peter Doherty in a vain attempt to stop him scoring the opening goal. In those days there were no substitutes, so Birmingham had to play the remainder of the match with ten men; they lost 4\u20130. Duckhouse died in Walsall in 1978 aged about 60.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Martin McDonnell", "response": ["McDonnell was born in Newton-le-Willows, which was then in Lancashire, in 1924. He played local football for Haydock C&B before joining Everton in 1942. After seven appearances in the wartime leagues spread over the next three seasons, he returned to local football with Earlestown, from where he joined Southport in August 1946, before the Football League resumed after the war. After one season Harry Storer signed him for Birmingham City as deputy for Ted Duckhouse. Two years later, Storer, now managing Coventry City, signed him again, and McDonnell remained at the club for six seasons and played 250 games in all competitions. When Storer took over as manager of Derby County, he promptly signed McDonnell for the third time. After three seasons with Derby, where he played more than 100 games in all competitions and helped the club win the Third Division North title in 1956\u201357, McDonnell finished off his professional career at Crewe Alexandra. He died in Bedford in 1988."]}, {"page": "1945\u201346 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["The replay, at Maine Road, Manchester, attracted huge interest. The second half of the match was scheduled for live radio broadcast, and the gates were closed on safety grounds about an hour before kickoff, with thousands locked out. \"Several thousands\" of the official attendance of 80,407 \"were allowed to sit on the ground almost up to the touch line\". The match went goalless to the last half-minute of normal time, when Harold Bodle was unmarked  from goal. Derby goalkeeper Vic Woodley stayed on his line, and \"Bodle took the ball to within eight yards of goal but hit the ball so near to Woodley that he was able to beat the ball away.\"Gil Merrick, quoted in Rollin, Soccer at War, p. 109.
