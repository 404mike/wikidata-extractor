This is a book; you need chapter 21, if you're going to read it ...  If you aren't, then the short answer is that it refers to the Six Acts of 1819 which levied a tax on newspapers. I gather that newspapers had to be registered under a security by the proprietor and it was this which was abolished. Newspaper proprietors had to give a \"security\" against libel in the period of distress/riots etc. immediately after the French Wars. The House of Lords debate says \"The principle of the present Bill was to repeal the Acts of Parliament which required securities of publishers and printers, and to preserve the Acts of Parliament which insisted on the registration of newspapers at Somerset House.\" He was a friend of Henry Bessemer."]}, {"page": "Collet (name)", "response": ["* Collet Dobson Collet (1812\u20131898), radical freethinker, Chartist and campaigner against newspaper taxation"]}, {"page": "Sophia Dobson Collet", "response": ["Sophia Dobson Collet was born Sophia Dobson in the parish of St. Pancras, London, the fifth of seven children of John Dobson (1778\u20131827), and his wife (and first cousin), Elizabeth Barker (1787\u20131875).
