He is best known for his patriotic song \"Rule, Britannia!\" and the song \"A-Hunting We Will Go\". Arne was a leading British theatre composer of the 18th century, working at Drury Lane and Covent Garden. He wrote many operatic entertainments for the London theatres and pleasure gardens, as well as concertos, sinfonias, and sonatas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Achilles", "response": ["* Achilles (London 1733) is a ballad opera, written by John Gay, parodied by Thomas Arne as Achilles in petticoats in 1773."]}, {"page": "God Save the Queen", "response": ["The first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus. The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in The Gentleman's Magazine (see illustration above). This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre."]}, {"page": "Judgement of Paris", "response": ["The story is the basis of an opera,  The Judgement of Paris, with a libretto by William Congreve, that was set to music by four composers in London, 1700\u20131701. Thomas Arne composed a highly successful score to the same libretto in 1742. The opera Le Cinesi (The Chinese Women) by Christoph Willibald Gluck (1754) concludes with a ballet, The Judgement of Paris, sung as a vocal quartet.

The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century, and was actively promoted by the British government and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed by nationalists and widely adopted. The Union Jack was adopted in 1801 as the national one.Nick Groom, The Union Jack: The Story of the British Flag (2007). Thomas Arne composed the patriotic song \"Rule, Britannia!\" in 1740, and the cartoonist John Arbuthnot invented the character of John Bull as the personification of the English national spirit in 1712."]}, {"page": "Opera", "response": ["Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to Thomas Arne, both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being Thomas and Sally in 1760. His opera Artaxerxes (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, Love in a Village (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. Charles Burney wrote that Arne introduced \"a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated\"."]}, {"page": "Round (music)", "response": ["Serious composers who turned their hand to the round format include Thomas Arne, John Blow, William Byrd, Henry Purcell, Louis Hardin, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Benjamin Britten (for example, \"Old Joe Has Gone Fishing\", sung by the villagers in the pub to keep the peace, at the end of act 1 of Peter Grimes) . Examples by J. S. Bach include the regular canons, Var. 3 and Var. 24 of the Goldberg Variations, and the perpetual canons, Canon 7 of The Musical Offering and Canon a 2 Perpetuus (BWV 1075). Several rounds are included amongst Arnold Schoenberg's thirty-plus canons, which \"within their natural limitations ... are brilliant pieces, containing too much of the composer's characteristically unexpected blend of seriousness, humour, vigour and tenderness to remain unperformed\"."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom", "response": ["Various styles of music are popular in the UK, including the indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Exceptional Renaissance and Baroque composers from the 16th and 17th centuries include Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, John Dowland, Henry Purcell and Thomas Arne. After moving to London under the reign of Qeen Anne, George Frideric Handel became a naturalised British citizen in 1727, when he composed the anthem Zadok the Priest for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Many of Handel's best-known works, such as Messiah, were written in the English language. Notable 19th- and 20th-century British composers include Edward Elgar, Hubert Parry, Gustav Holst, Arthur Sullivan (most famous for working with the librettist W. S. Gilbert), Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten, pioneer of modern British opera.

It was composed by the English composer Thomas Arne and written by the Scottish poet and playwright James Thomson as part of the masque Alfred, which was first performed on 1 August 1740 at Cliveden, the country home of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Thomas Arne was also one of Frederick's favourite artists. A masque linking the Prince with both the medieval hero-king Alfred the Great's victories over the Vikings and with the contemporary issue of building up British sea power obviously went well with Frederick's political plans and aspirations. Later the song gained a life of its own outside of the masque. Thomson, who supported the Prince of Wales politically, also dedicated an earlier work dedicated to him: Liberty (1734). "]}, {"page": "Eton College", "response": ["*Thomas Arne, composer"]}, {"page": "Masque", "response": ["In the 18th-century, masques were even less frequently staged. \"Rule, Britannia!\" started out as part of Alfred, a masque about Alfred the Great co-written by James Thomson and David Mallet with music by Thomas Arne which was first performed at Cliveden, country house of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Performed to celebrate the third birthday of Frederick's daughter Augusta, it remains among the best-known British patriotic songs up to the present, while the masque of which it was originally part is only remembered by specialist historians.", "While the masque was no longer as popular as it was at its height in the 17th Century, there are many later examples of the masque. During the late 17th century, English semi-operas by composers such as Henry Purcell had masque scenes inset between the acts of the play proper. In the 18th century, William Boyce and Thomas Arne, continued to utilize the masque genre mostly as an occasional piece, and the genre became increasingly associated with patriotic topics. Acis and Galatea (Handel) is another successful example. There are isolated examples throughout the first half of the 19th century."]}, {"page": "Rosamund Clifford", "response": ["* Rosamond is a 1733 opera by Thomas Arne to Joseph Addison\u2019s libretto."]}, {"page": "John Banim", "response": ["Unable to do much work for the weekly papers because of his illness, he began doing more work for monthly periodicals.

Banim befriended Griffin and did everything he could to assist him, helping to edit his plays and to have them submitted for production. Griffin said the following of Banim in a letter:\"What would I have done if I had not found Banim? I should never be tired of talking about and thinking of Banim.

It usually takes place on the second Saturday in September, and is broadcast in the UK on BBC Radio 3, and on television on BBC Two (first half) and BBC One (second half).  The concert is traditionally in a lighter, 'winding-down' vein, with popular classics followed by a second half of British patriotic pieces. This sequence traditionally includes Edward Elgar's \"Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1\" (to part of which \"Land of Hope and Glory\" is sung) and Henry Wood's \"Fantasia on British Sea Songs\", followed by Thomas Arne's \"Rule, Britannia!\". The concert concludes with Hubert Parry's \"Jerusalem\", and the British national anthem, since 2010 in an arrangement by Benjamin Britten. The repeat of the Elgar march at the Last Night can be traced to the spontaneous audience demand for a double encore after its premiere at a 1901 Proms concert. The closing sequence of the second half became fully established in 1954 during Sargent's tenure as chief conductor. The Prommers have made a tradition of singing \"Auld Lang Syne\" after the end of the concert, but this was not included in the programme until 2015. However, when James Loughran, a Scot, conducted the Last Night concert in the late 1970s and early 1980s he did include the piece within the programme."]}]}}
