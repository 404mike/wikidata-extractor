He is best known for his close friendship with writer Samuel Johnson and his numerous appearances in James Boswell's book The Life of Samuel Johnson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joshua Reynolds", "response": ["Because of his popularity as a portrait painter, Reynolds enjoyed constant interaction with the wealthy and famous men and women of the day, and it was he who brought together the figures of \"The\" Club. It was founded in 1764 and met in a suite of rooms on the first floor of the Turks Head at 9 Gerrard Street, now marked by a plaque. Original members included Burke, Bennet Langton, Topham Beauclerk, Goldsmith, Anthony Chamier, Thomas Hawkins, and Nugent, to be joined by Garrick, Boswell, and Sheridan. In ten years the membership had risen to 35. The Club met every Monday evening for supper and conversation and continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning. In later years, it met fortnightly during Parliamentary sessions. When in 1783 the landlord of the Turks Head died and the property was sold, The Club moved to Sackville Street.City of Westminster green plaques ", "It is to this lukewarm temperament that Frederick W. Hilles, Bodman Professor of English Literature at Yale attributes Reynolds' never having married. In the editorial notes of his compendium Portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds, Hilles theorizes that \"as a corollary one might say that he [Reynolds] was somewhat lacking in a capacity for love\", and cites Boswell's notary papers: \"He said the reason he would never marry was that every woman whom he liked had grown indifferent to him, and he had been glad he did not marry her.\" Reynolds' own sister, Frances, who lived with him as housekeeper, took her own negative opinion further still, thinking him \"a gloomy tyrant\". The presence of family compensated Reynolds for the absence of a wife; he wrote on one occasion to his friend Bennet Langton, that both his sister and niece were away from home \"so that I am quite a bachelor\". Reynolds did not marry, and had no known children."]}, {"page": "Samuel Johnson", "response": ["On 16 March 1756, Johnson was arrested for an outstanding debt of \u00a35 18s. Unable to contact anyone else, he wrote to the writer and publisher Samuel Richardson. Richardson, who had previously lent Johnson money, sent him six guineas to show his good will, and the two became friends. Soon after, Johnson met and befriended the painter Joshua Reynolds, who so impressed Johnson that he declared him \"almost the only man whom I call a friend\". Reynolds' younger sister Frances observed during their time together \"that men, women and children gathered around him [Johnson]\", laughing at his gestures and gesticulations. In addition to Reynolds, Johnson was close to Bennet Langton and Arthur Murphy. Langton was a scholar and an admirer of Johnson who persuaded his way into a meeting with Johnson which led to a long friendship. Johnson met Murphy during the summer of 1754 after Murphy came to Johnson about the accidental republishing of the Rambler No. 190, and the two became friends. Around this time, Anna Williams began boarding with Johnson. She was a minor poet who was poor and becoming blind, two conditions that Johnson attempted to change by providing room for her and paying for a failed cataract surgery. Williams, in turn, became Johnson's housekeeper."]}, {"page": "Topham Beauclerk", "response": ["Topham Beauclerk entertained Dr Johnson at his home in Old Windsor for a number of weeks. He appears several times in James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson.  As Bennet Langton records: \"His affection for Topham Beauclerk was so great, that when Beauclerk was labouring under that severe illness which at last occasioned his death, Johnson said (with a voice faultering  with emotion), 'Sir, I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to save Beauclerk'.\" (Boswell 1672)."]}, {"page": "The Idler (1758\u201360)", "response": ["The Idler was a series of 103 essays, all but twelve of them by Samuel Johnson, published in the London weekly the Universal Chronicle between 1758 and 1760. It is likely that the Chronicle was published for the sole purpose of including The Idler, since it had produced only one issue before the series began, and ceased publication when it finished. The authors besides Johnson were Thomas Warton, Bennet Langton, and Joshua Reynolds."]}, {"page": "The Club (dining club)", "response": ["* Bennet Langton"]}, {"page": "Francis Barber", "response": ["When making his will, Johnson asked Sir John Hawkins, later his first biographer, what provision he should make for Barber. Sir John said that a nobleman would give 50 pounds a year (). Then I shall be \"noblissimus\" replied Johnson, and give him 70 (). Hawkins disapproved, and after Johnson's death criticised his \"ostentatious bounty [and] favour to negroes\".\"Samuel Johnson's Last Years\".

Even James Boswell found it wanting:Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and beautiful language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of the drama.  Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece:At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a house in the country, he [Johnson] left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, \"Sir, I thought it had been better.\"' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: \"Of his early tragedy Irene [...] it is enough to say that its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama.\" T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect:His verse has none of the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness in such isolation becomes itself a fault.  The play would be more readable to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech.  What would be mellifluous in rhyme, is merely monotonous without it."]}, {"page": "St. Michael's Church, Southampton", "response": ["High on the south wall is a memorial to Bennet Langton, with Samuel Johnson's epitaph to his close friend."]}, {"page": "Langton by Spilsby", "response": ["Bennet Langton (c. 1736 - 1801) of Langton Hall was a writer, scholar, and friend of Samuel Johnson."]}, {"page": "William Johnson Temple", "response": ["During a visit to London in May 1773 Temple dined at the house of Charles and Edward Dilly, the publishers in The Poultry, meeting Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Bennet Langton, Boswell, and others; and in April 1775 Boswell paid him a visit at Mamhead. In the meantime Temple published his first essay (1774); Bishop Keppel made him his chaplain, and by November 1775 he had received the promise of another living, St Gluvias with the chapelry of Budock. As vicar of St Gluvias from 1776, Temple spent the rest of his days.

It was for Andrew Kippis that he provided in 1793 a memoir of Sir Richard Fanshawe for Biographia Britannica, largely based on his reading of Fanshawe's wife Lady Fanshawe\u2019s manuscript memoirs of her husband. Lady Fanshawe, the daughter of Sir John Harrison, was the sister of Margaret, the wife of Turnor\u2019s ancestor Sir Edmund Turnor.
