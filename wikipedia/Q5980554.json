A lacklustre pre-release in October 1980 of the song \"Dancing with Myself\", backed by a B-side of a Rocksteadyesque dub song entitled \"Ugly Rash\", with a stark cover art portrait of Idol photographed by Iain McKell utilizing a child model in a disturbing way, had also failed to launch the new act, reaching only No. 62 in the UK Singles Chart. A hotchpotch EP, entitled Gen X - 4, containing Generation X and Gen X material was also released in January to little effect. Critical reviews of the new LP in the music press were also generally indifferent, or hostile, with Smash Hits magazine giving it 2 out of 10.Review of 'Kiss Me Deadly' LP, Smash Hits, 22 January 1981 In consequence, after receiving notification from Aucoin that Idol was now willing to abandon the band, Chrysalis Records dropped the contract, writing off the quarter of a million pounds that it had invested into the act's development over four years,'The Ballad of Billy & Tony', New Musical Express, 21 February 1981 and Gen X broke up in February 1981.

The resultant implosion was recorded by a Channel 4 camera crew, making an early reality TV documentary series about the magazine's relaunch, and also featured in The Independent in a feature titled 'From the Penthouse to the Street', which opened with the line 'If anyone could have done it, it should have been Michelle Olley.'"]}, {"page": "Imogen Heap discography", "response": ["|Iain McKell"]}, {"page": "McKell", "response": ["*Iain McKell, English photographer"]}, {"page": "Exeter College of Art and Design", "response": ["*Iain McKell fashion, portrait and social documentary photographer "]}, {"page": "Cultural Traffic", "response": ["Cultural Traffic was founded by Toby Mott in 2016.
