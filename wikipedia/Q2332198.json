In 1833 William Brunton patented another steam-powered excavator which he provided further details on in 1836. The steam shovel was invented by William Otis, who received a patent for his design in 1839. The first machines were known as 'partial-swing', since the boom could not rotate through 360 degrees. They were built on a railway chassis, on which the boiler and movement engines were mounted. The shovel arm and driving engines were mounted at one end of the chassis, which accounts for the limited swing. Bogies with flanged wheels were fitted, and power was taken to the wheels by a chain drive to the axles. Temporary rail tracks were laid by workers where the shovel was expected to work, and repositioned as required."]}, {"page": "Steam Horse locomotive", "response": ["The Steam Horse was constructed by the Butterley Company in Derbyshire in 1813 by William Brunton (1777\u20131851).

In 1864, an experimental tunnelling machine was used to bore a binocular tunnel in the main pit. The tunnelling machine was thought to be supplied by John Dickinson Brunton the son of noted engineer William Brunton. The machine was powered by a remote steam engine, with transmission via a rope. It cut a circular hole in the rock, leaving a central core which was broken off and extracted to leave a circular tunnel. Two tunnels were driven, overlapping slightly, to produce a twin-bore tunnel whose profile resemble a binocular. These tunnels are now considered one of Wales' \"scenic gems\"."]}]}}
