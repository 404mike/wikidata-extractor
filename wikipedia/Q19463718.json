Stott had commercial and international critical success with a number of his paintings depicting children at play. They possess a tenderness that suggests an affinity with children. The Old Gate (1895) was chosen for a major art exhibition in Munich. It shows a boy and a team of plough horses returning home on a late summer's evening where they are welcomed by two young girls bathed in the shadows of a late evening sun. Stott presents a painting in tune with the sensibilities of his audience that rural life was stable and permanent and built on rituals of hard work. The painting which is now owned by the Manchester Art Gallery was subsequently shown at the Brussels Exposition in 1897 and at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900, possibly at the request of Stott's friend and patron Isidore Spielmann."]}]}}
