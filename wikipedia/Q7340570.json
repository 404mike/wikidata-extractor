The early cast featured just 16 characters and it would be a full 12 months before the six houses in Brookside Close became fully occupied. This was intentional, as Redmond wanted to reflect the pace of real life 'new-build' estate occupancy. Therefore, introductory episodes concentrated on the development of the anchor Grant family, with Sheila (Sue Johnston) and Bobby (Ricky Tomlinson) who had moved up the social ladder to a big, four-bedroomed house on the 'middle-class' Brookside Close from a run-down council estate. The Grants were the first family to have moved onto the Close and they lived at number 5 and were the focus of earliest advertising campaigns promoting the programme. Initially, only three of the six new-builds were occupied by characters and Episode 1 saw the arrival of the Collins family led by Annabelle (Doreen Sloane), who is the first actor to be seen in the first episode, and Paul Collins (Jim Wiggins). In contrast to the Grants, the Collinses were on their way down the social ladder, downsizing from their lavish home on the upmarket Wirral, to the smaller, more modest, number 8 Brookside Close following Paul's redundancy. The contrast between the families was heavily featured, particularly Bobby's left wing and Paul's right wing views. Other characters included Heather Black (Amanda Burton in her TV debut) and Roger Huntington (Rob Spendlove), two young professionals residing at semi-detached number 9 who took an instant dislike to the Grants. Low class newly-weds Gavin (Daniel Webb) and Petra Taylor (Alexandra Pigg) moved into number 10 during very early episodes, memorably selling stolen cookers from the front lawn, infuriating their new neighbours.Brookside.

Heather is one of the show's original characters and debuted on-screen during the first episode broadcast on 2 November 1982. Heather and her husband, Roger Huntington (Rob Spendlove) assume the roles of the show's young professional characters. Portrayed as yuppies, they work in accountancy and prioritise their careers over anything else. Writers characterised Heather ambitious and studious, determined to be a successful accountant. Another theme writers often used in developing Heather was heartbreak via her numerous failed romances. She transformed into an unlucky-in-love character with a failed marriage to Rob and hopeless relationships with Stuart Griffiths (Danny McCarthy), Don Summerhill (Jonathan Barlow) and Tom Curzon (Brian Stephens).", "When the series begins, Heather lives at number nine Brookside Close, alongside her husband, Roger Huntington (Rob Spendlove). She and Roger met while studying at Liverpool University, formed a relationship and stayed in the city. The couple represent the British upper class and young professionals. Heather is Irish and is used to having good finances because her parents run a successful hotel in Northern Ireland.Redmond 1987, p.60. Heather works as an accountant and is characterised as a glamorous female.Redmond 1987, p.90. In the book, Brookside: The Official Companion, show creator Phil Redmond profiled Heather as a \"accountancy undergraduate with a smile that could buy her the world.\" Heather is \"ambitious\" and studious, wanting to pass her final accountancy exams. Heather loves money and her work to the extent that she brings extra work home to complete in the evenings.Redmond 1987, p.61. Heather and Roger do not plan on beginning a family because Heather realises that she needs to concentrate solely on her career to be successful. Redmond noted that despite this characterisation, Heather \"isn't heartless\" and perhaps would consider a family of her own in the future. He added that Heather was a \"central character\" who introduced viewers to the lifestyle yuppies had become accustomed to."]}, {"page": "Sheila Grant", "response": ["After Bobby had spent his first months of Brookside Close fighting to save his job and 200 others at Fairbanks Engineering, Sheila is the one made redundant in 1983.

The two however disagree when Sheila nominated Roger Huntingdon (Rob Spendlove) as chairman instead of Annabelle and when they clash over what type of group it should be with Annabelle wanting it to be an apolitical group bringing issues such as hedges and refuse collection to the attention of the council while Sheila wanted to use it to campaign about the poor standard of schooling in the area and the lack of jobs for their children.
