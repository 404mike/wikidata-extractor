He was often paired with the comic actor George Grossmith, Jr.\nAfter about a decade touring and in stock productions, Payne joined the company at the Gaiety Theatre in London, gaining notice for creating a comic character in the musical In Town (1892).  He spent more than two decades at the Gaiety, using his diminutive stature, malleable features, distinctive lisp and comic dance ability to his advantage.  His further successes in the 1890s included lovable comic roles in such long-running shows as The Shop Girl (1894), The Circus Girl (1896) and A Runaway Girl (1898).  In the new century, he created memorable characters in such hits as The Messenger Boy (1900), The Toreador (1902), The Orchid (1903), The Spring Chicken (1905), The Girls of Gottenberg (1907), Our Miss Gibbs (1909) and The Sunshine Girl (1912).", "link_mentions": {}}}
