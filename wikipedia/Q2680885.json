Ritornello form was used in the fast movements of baroque concertos and in many baroque vocal and choral works. The ripieno (tutti) plays the main ritornello theme, while soloists play the intervening episodes. As typical of Baroque continuo playing, in the tutti sections the soloists also play as part of the ensemble; while in the solo sections most of the remaining instruments in the ensemble may stop, in order to provide some transparency to the soloist(s), or may be used sparsely (in either case, the solos are accompanied thoroughly or punctuated by a harpsichord or the like, together with a violoncello da gamba or the like).David Fallows, \"Tutti\", in: Grove Music Online, January 20, 2001 (Accessed 12 October 2018); Peter Williams and David Ledbetter, \"Continuo\", in: Grove Music Online, January 20, 2001 (Accessed 12 October 2018). While Rondo form is similar to ritornello form, it is different in that ritornello brings back the subject or main theme in fragments and in different keys, but the rondo brings back its theme complete and in the same key. Cedric Thorpe Davie is one author, however, who considers the ritornello form the ancestor, not of the rondo form, but of the classical concerto form (which also occurs, as a form, in many a classical-era aria).Thorpe Davie, Musical Structure and Design."]}, {"page": "Scottish Renaissance", "response": ["Robin Orr (1909\u20132006) and Cedric Thorpe Davie (1913\u20131983) were influenced by modernism and Scottish musical cadences.

After World War I, Robin Orr and Cedric Thorpe Davie were influenced by modernism and Scottish musical cadences. Erik Chisholm founded the Scottish Ballet Society and helped create several ballets. The Edinburgh Festival was founded in 1947 and led to an expansion of classical music in Scotland, leading to the foundation of Scottish Opera in 1960.
