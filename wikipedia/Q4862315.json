His business interests included the manufacture of wire, and in 1998 a blue plaque was erected at Penns Hall, by the Sutton Coldfield Civic Society, honouring his involvement in the first transatlantic telegraph cable.\nIn 1855, the business of Websters was merged with that of Horsfall at Hay Mills, Birmingham and, in 1859, the whole business was transferred to Hay Mills and the Penns Mills were closed down, with serious financial consequences for many workers and the economy of the Walmley area of Sutton Coldfield.", "link_mentions": {}}}
