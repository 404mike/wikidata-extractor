Elected a Fellow of Trinity in 1971, he has also served on the Secretariat of the UN Economic Commission for Europe and has held posts in the UK Cabinet Office, HM Treasury (its first Economic Advisor in the 1960s) and at the MIT Center for International Studies, India Project. A former Deputy Director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, he was in 1966 appointed as founding Director (with Alva Myrdal and then Gunnar Myrdal as chairman) of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and has held other influential posts in commerce and on advisory bodies. In that same year, he was appointed by Harold Wilson as a member of the Fulton Committee on the Civil Service.\nWidely published on issues concerned with economics and peace studies, Neild was also the author of The English, The French and the Oyster. Written on his retirement and spurred by a holiday in France, this is a historical-economic exploration of relative prices of oysters in Britain and France and the political and economic origins of these.  He also wrote Public Corruption: The Dark Side of Social Evolution (Anthem Press).  \nAmong memorable quotes, Neild, rebuffing Blair\u2019s claims about Saddam Hussein's alleged biological weapons, wrote: 'To say that the UN inspectors found \"enough to have killed the world's population several times over\" is equivalent to the statement that a man in his prime can produce a million sperm any day, therefore he can produce a million babies a day. The problem in both cases is that of delivery systems.'He died on 18 December 2018 at the age of 94.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Robert Neild (Trinity)"]}, {"page": "Stockholm International Peace Research Institute", "response": ["* Robert Neild (United Kingdom, 1967\u201371)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Robert Neild (1924\u20132018), Cambridge economist and peace researcher"]}, {"page": "Nora Sayre", "response": ["She married the economist Robert Neild in 1957 but the marriage was dissolved four years later.
