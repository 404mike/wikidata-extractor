It includes only the first four acts and is based on the Italian version of Alfonso de Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez; it is often referred to as an Interlude, and its original title is A New Comedy in English in Manner of an Interlude Right Elegant and Full of Craft of Rhetoric: Wherein is Shewed and Described as well the Beauty and Good Properties of Women, as Their Vices and Evil Conditions with a Moral Conclusion and Exhortation to Virtue.. The Scottish poet William Drummond (1585\u20131649) translated Garcilaso de la Vega and Juan Bosc\u00e1n. The English knew the masterpieces of Castilian literature, from early translations of Amad\u00eds de Gaula by Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo and the C\u00e1rcel de amor by Diego de San Pedro. Sir Philip Sidney had read Siete libros de la Diana by the Hispano-Portuguese Jorge de Montemayor, whose poetry influenced him greatly. John Bourchier translated Libro de Marco Aurelio by Antonio de Guevara. David Rowland translated Lazarillo de Tormes in 1586, which may have inspired the first English picaresque novel, The Unfortunate Traveller (1594), by Thomas Nashe. By the end of the 16th century, the Celestina had been translated fully (in London, J. Wolf, 1591; Adam Islip, 1596; William Apsley, 1598; and others). Some of the translators of that time traveled or lived for some time in Spain, such as Lord Berners, Bartholomew Yong, Thomas Shelton, Leonard Digges and James Mabbe. William Cecil (Lord Burghley; 1520\u20131598) owned the largest Spanish library in the United Kingdom.", "The first translation of Don Quixote into a foreign language was the English version by Thomas Shelton (first part, 1612; second, 1620). And Don Quixote was imitated in the satirical poem Hudibras (1663\u201378), composed by Samuel Butler. In addition, the works of some great Golden Age poets were translated into English by Richard Fanshawe, who died in Madrid. As early as 1738, a luxurious London edition of Don Quixote in Spanish was published, prepared by the Sephardic Cervantist Pedro Pineda, with an introduction by Gregorio Mayans and ornate engravings. Also in the 18th century two new translations of Don Quixote were published, one by the painter Charles Jervas (1742) and one by Tobias Smollett, a writer of picaresque novels (1755). Smollet appears as an avid reader of Spanish narrative, and that influence is always present in his works. Meanwhile, the best work of the 17th-century writer Charlotte Lennox is The Female Quixote (1752), which was inspired by Cervantes. Cervantes also was the inspiration for The Spiritual Quixote, by Richard Graves. Thwe first critical and annotated edition of Don Quixote was that of the English clergyman John Bowle (1781). The novelists Henry Fielding and Lawrence Sterne also were familiar with the works of Cervantes."]}, {"page": "Thomas Shelton", "response": ["Thomas Shelton may refer to:", "* Thomas Shelton (translator), translator of Don Quixote", "* Thomas Shelton (stenographer) (died 1650), English stenographer", "* Thomas Shelton (gospel singer) (born 1958), Southern gospel musician", "* Thomas Shelton (aircraft constructor)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Shelton (stenographer)", "response": ["Thomas Shelton (1600/01\u20131650(?)) was an English stenographer and the inventor of a much-used British 17th- and 18th-century stenography.", "The 1647 edition of Thomas Shelton's Tachygraphie contains a portrait giving his age as 46, implying that he was born in 1600/01.
