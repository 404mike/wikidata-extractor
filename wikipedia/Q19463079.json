The influence of children's clothes in portraits by British painter John Hoppner (1758\u20131810) may have provided her some inspiration. Liberty of London adapted Kate Greenaway's drawings as designs for actual children's clothes. A full generation of mothers in the liberal-minded \"artistic\" British circles who called themselves The Souls and embraced the Arts and Crafts movement dressed their daughters in Kate Greenaway pantaloons and bonnets in the 1880s and 1890s. The style was often used by painter Maude Goodman in her depictions of children."]}, {"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Maude Goodman \u2013 artist, buried under her married name, Matilda Scanes"]}, {"page": "Bellis perennis", "response": ["File:Maude Goodmann The daisy chain.jpg|The daisy chain by Maude Goodman (1936)"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Maude Goodman (1853\u20131938) (a.k.a.
