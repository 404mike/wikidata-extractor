As academic James Kendrick wrote, initial reviewers of the film \"were confounded by [its] boundary-crossing aesthetic.\" Its thematic content stirred controversy as well.

But when it is captured, let it be locked up in a cell, either in a prison or a madhouse. Do not let it be presented with music by Wagner or Chopin, [...] to young men and women, who have entered the enchanted world of a movie theatre.\""]}, {"page": "John Fitchett Marsh", "response": ["On the incorporation of Warrington in 1847 Marsh was appointed town-clerk, and held the office until 1858.
