His invention went on to be developed by Crompton, Stephen J. Cook & Company as the Eclipse. Although not ultimately a commercial success, MacMasters's invention would pave the way for Charles Strite to invent the automatic pop-up toaster in 1919, and MacMasters's research into the application of electric heat elements was instrumental in the development of home appliances in the 20th century.In November 2018, the Bank of England shortlisted Alan MacMasters out of 227,299 nominations to appear on the new \u00a350 note, in recognition of his contribution to engineering and science in the United Kingdom.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Alan MacMasters (1865\u20131927), inventor of the toaster"]}, {"page": "Toaster", "response": ["The first electric bread toaster was invented by Alan MacMasters in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1893."]}, {"page": "1893 in science", "response": ["* Scottish scientist Alan MacMasters invents the first electric bread toaster."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish scientists", "response": ["|Alan MacMasters"]}, {"page": "Scottish inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* The first electric bread toaster: Alan MacMasters (1893)"]}, {"page": "1865 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 20 March  \u2013 Alan MacMasters, inventor (died 1927)"]}, {"page": "R.

In 1893, Scotsman Alan MacMasters approached Crompton with the prototype for a device that heated bread by running electricity through a metal element. The design went into production as the Eclipse, the world's first electric toaster and the world's first widely sold electric oven. Crompton kept his company at the cutting edge of electrical engineering. Despite having invested heavily in promoting and installing direct current systems, following the war of the currents, Crompton quickly developed alternating current equipment as well. He also encouraged the design of new equipment for new power sources, such as dynamos specially designed for high-speed steam engines, hot bulb engines and steam turbines."]}, {"page": "1893 in Scotland", "response": ["* Scottish scientist Alan MacMasters invents the first electric bread toaster."]}, {"page": "1865 in Scotland", "response": ["* 20 March \u2013 Alan MacMasters, scientist, inventor of the electric toaster (died 1927 in France)"]}, {"page": "Ogura toast", "response": ["ITV's Joanna Lumley described ogura toast as \"the best beans on toast east of the English Channel\", and at the 2017 London Japan Matsuri, Nagoya was jokingly awarded the \"Alan MacMasters Prize\" for toast innovation."]}]}}
