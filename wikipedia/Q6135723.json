Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice. Kafka's extant letters to Bauer were published as  (Letters to Felice); her letters do not survive. According to the biographers Stach and James Hawes, Kafka became engaged a third time around 1920, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid. Although the two rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time, Kafka began a draft of Letter to His Father, who objected to Julie because of her Zionist beliefs. Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman. While he needed women and sex in his life, he had low self-confidence, felt sex was dirty, and was cripplingly shy\u2014especially about his body.", "However, James Hawes argues many of Kafka's descriptions of the legal proceedings in \u2014metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear\u2014are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was \"keenly aware of the legal debates of his day\". In an early 21st-century publication that uses Kafka's office writings as its point of departure, Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law \"has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination\"."]}, {"page": "2000 in Wales", "response": ["*Rancid Aluminium, based on the novel by James Hawes, with Rhys Ifans, Keith Allen and Brian Hibbard.Rancid Aluminium.
