Born in Darwen, Lancashire, he was playing local junior football when he was signed by Football League side Burnley in May 1888. He played his only League match for Burnley on 27 October 1888 at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, then home of Notts County. Hibbert played outside-right in place of Alec Brady who had moved to inside-right. Despite kicking into the wind County were 2 up in eleven minutes. Later in the first-half County thought they had gone three up but their \"goal\" was ruled off-side. The second-half started hopefully for Burnley. The County goalkeeper Jack Holland was injured and Burnley winger Jack Yates made it 1\u20132. However ten minutes into the half County had re-established their two-goal lead. Burnley slumped as the match wore on and lost 1\u20136. \nHibbert left Burnley in 1889, and his whereabouts thereafter are untraced.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Hibbert", "response": ["Sir Jack Hibbert  (14 February 1932 \u2013 23 August 2005) was a British statistician and director of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) of the United Kingdom, 1985\u20131992.

Shortly after this, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, and other Conservative politicians claimed that misleading statistics were largely responsible for the Government's poor handling of the economy. The Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee recommended 'a thorough review into the operation of various Departments involved in the collection of national accounts statistics'. The review, by Stephen Pickford, recommended that there should be just one organisation responsible for the collection and compilation of statistics for national accounts.", "This meant moving the Business Statistics Office and responsibility for data on imports and exports from the Department of Trade and Industry, and responsibility for the Retail Prices Index from the Department of Employment.  The changes, in July 1989, increased the CSO from just under 170 staff to about 1,000. This was probably the biggest shake-up of official statistics since the creation of the CSO in 1941.  Jack Hibbert had the difficult job of creating this new organisation.", "*Lynch, R.
