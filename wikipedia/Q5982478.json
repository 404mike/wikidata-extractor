He published two strongly personalised critiques of London and Paris, and collaborated with Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, who considered his reports to be too subjective, but acknowledged him as the better writer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jonathan Meades", "response": ["His next series was Abroad in Britain, broadcast on BBC Two in 1990. It featured five irreverent, \"slightly bonkers\" films which explored unusual and neglected aspects of the built environment: informal plotland dwellings along the Severn Valley, nautical culture around the Solent and architectural forms associated with utopianism, bohemians and the military. Each episode was introduced by Meades as being \"devoted to the proposition that the exotic begins at home.\" The series was influenced by the work of architectural critic Ian Nairn and French New Wave film director Alain Robbe-Grillet, and it cemented Meades' uniquely incongruous on-screen persona: dark glasses, dark suits, inscrutable, didactic delivery and dense, mordant language peppered with gags and surreal interludes. Rachel Cooke of The Guardian later described his TV persona as \"pugnacious, sardonic and seemingly super-confident\", while noting the RADA training and that it was \"not the real Jonathan Meades, who is an altogether more diffident and shy character [...] except when drunk\". The series spawned four sequels: Further Abroad (1994), Even Further Abroad (1997), Abroad Again in Britain (2005) and  Abroad Again (2007), along with several other series and stand-alone films, the majority of which have been archived on the website MeadesShrine."]}, {"page": "Liverpool", "response": ["* \"If Liverpool can get into top gear again, there is no limit to the city's potential.

His buildings coupled with their often accompanying gardens by Gertrude Jekyll, while in a style thought of as \"olde world\" would not be recognisable to inhabitants of the 16th century. Another noted practitioner was George A. Crawley. A decorator and designer, rather than an architect, Crawley greatly expanded the original medieval hall house, Crowhurst Place in Surrey, firstly for himself and latterly for Consuelo Vanderbilt. The result, \"remarkable in its own right\", saw Crawley add extensions, chimneys, gables, linenfold panelling and large amounts of half-timbering. Martin Conway, writing in Country Life, considered Crawley's reconstruction gave the remains of the original manor, \"a beauty far greater than was ever theirs in the days of its newness\". Ian Nairn, Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry, in the 1971 revised Surrey Pevsner Buildings of England, note the sense of escapism which inspired much of the Tudor Revival, calling Crowhurst, \"an extreme example of the English flight from reality around the 1914-18 war\"."]}, {"page": "Architectural Review", "response": ["*Ian Nairn \u2013 contributor"]}, {"page": "Christ's Hospital railway station", "response": ["In spite of a plea from the architectural critic Ian Nairn that Christ's Hospital station should be preserved in its original form, rationalisation began in autumn 1972 and continued until December, involving much simplification of the buildings and track layout to reduce them to a size more suited to the station's existing traffic. The station was rebuilt out of all recognition with demolition of all the main station buildings and reduction of the number of platforms from seven to two.
