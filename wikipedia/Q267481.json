Between 1878 and 1910, tens of thousands of Circassians had relocated to Ottoman Syria after being displaced by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo-Circassian War. The Ottoman authorities directed the Circassian immigrants, who were mainly of peasant stock, to settle in Amman, and distributed arable land among them. Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman Kamil Pasha's project to establish a vilayet centered in Amman, which, along with other sites in its vicinity, would become Circassian-populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus\u2013Medina highway.Hanania 2018, p. 2. The first Circassian settlers, who belonged to the Shapsug dialect group,Hanania 2018, p. 3. lived near Amman's Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built.

Briefly, he held that Harris was originally honest, greatly gifted, and possessed of certain psychical powers. But in the end he came to practice unbridled licence under the loftiest pretensions, made the profession of extreme disinterestedness a cloak to conceal his avarice, and demanded from his followers a blind and supple obedience.", "The information about Harris in Memoir of the Life of Laurence Oliphant and of Alice Oliphant, his Wife (1891), by Margaret Oliphant, his cousin, has not been shaken in any important particular, and Oliphant's own portrait of Harris in Masollam is apparently unexaggerated.

Led by Ariga Hanya, a number of r\u014dnin assembled at the Toraya inn at Shinagawa-juku, and made their attack on the night of July 5, 1861 at 10 PM. Within the legation, some of the staff had stayed awake to follow the passage of a comet while Alcock slept in his apartments. There was a squad of sentries guarding the legation from Nishio Domain and Yamato-K\u014driyama Domain but no particular precautions had been taken. The situation had returned to normal after the events of 1860 and no one suspected an imminent attack. When the Mito r\u014dnin stormed the legation, the Japanese sentries fought back vigorously, killing three (including Ariga) and capturing three others. Two of the defenders were killed, and ten wounded, including George Morrison and the writer Laurence Oliphant, who were later sent back to England to recover.

Druze from the Yamani tribo-political faction may have also migrated to Mount Carmel from Mount Lebanon in the aftermath of the Battle of Ain Dara in 1711, though most of the migration was directed to the Jabal Hauran. Six out of the eight Druze villages established on Mount Carmel were abandoned or destroyed during Egyptian rule in the Levant (1831\u20131840). The local accounts recorded by Laurence Oliphant, who built himself a summer house in Daliyat al-Karmil in the 1880s, hold that the villages were abandoned for Jabal Hauran due to the oppressive rule of the governor Ibrahim Pasha, while Conder noted that the villages were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha. Daliyat al-Karmil and nearby Isfiya were the sole Druze settlements left standing on Mount Carmel. The local tradition trace Daliyat al-Karmel's founding to the 18th century when a Druze family from Jabal al-A'la near Aleppo settled on ancient ruins in the village. Successive waves of Druze families from Jabal al-A'la followed and together they formed the Halaby (\"Aleppine\") clan.
