He was also the patentee of the Bow porcelain factory, London, and claimed in his epitaph to be \"the inventor and first manufacturer of porcelain in England,\" though his rivals at the Chelsea porcelain factory seem to have preceded him in bringing wares to market. The Bow porcelain works did not long survive Frye's death; their final auctions took place in May 1764. \nFrye was born at Edenderry, County Offaly, Ireland, in 1710; in his youth he went to London to practice as an artist. His earliest works are a pair of pastel portraits of boys, one dated 1734 (Earl of Iveagh). For the Worshipful Company of Saddlers he painted a full-length portrait of Frederick, Prince of Wales (1736, destroyed 1940), which he engraved in mezzotint and published in 1741. With his silent partner, a London merchant Edward Heylyn, he took out a patent on kaolin to be imported from the English colony of Virginia in November 1745, and became manager of the Bow factory from its obscure beginnings in the 1740s. He retired to Wales in 1759 for the sake of his lungs, but soon returned to London and resumed his occupation as an engraver, publishing the series of life-size fancy portraits in mezzotint, by which he is most remembered. He died of consumption on 2 April 1762 and was buried at Hornsey.\nFrye had five children; his two daughters assisted him in painting porcelain at Bow until their marriages. One of them, who married a Mr Willcox, was employed by Josiah Wedgwood at the Wedgwood Etruria works in painting figure-subjects from 1759 to 1776, the year of her death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Leveridge", "response": ["The National Portrait Gallery, London has an oil portrait of the young Richard Leveridge, c. 1710\u201320, by an unknown artist, which is on display at the Handel House Museum, London.See portrait Accession NPG 6596 at National Portrait Gallery website.

In 1749, Thomas Frye, a portrait painter, took out a patent on a porcelain containing bone ash. This was the first bone china; only much later, around 1794, was the formula perfected by Josiah Spode, and then soon near-universally adopted in England.  But bone ash was frequently an ingredient in English soft-paste.
