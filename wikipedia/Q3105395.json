The match finished as a 1\u20131 draw, and Harrison kept his place for three more matches, before England international Williamson returned to the side and remained in it for more than two years. Williamson caught influenza in January 1922, and Harrison came into the team for the visit to Manchester City and kept his place for the rest of the season. Harrison did not appear in 1922\u201323, but played 11 matches in 1923\u201324, which took his total to 31 over five seasons."]}]}}
