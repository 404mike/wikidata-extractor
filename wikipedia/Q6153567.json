In The Politics of Individualism, she makes a distinction between existential individualism and instrumental individualism and examines how these forms are utilized in liberalism (particularly liberal feminism) and anarchism. She argues for a new vision of human freedom which incorporates the insights of feminism and liberalism into a form of anarchism based on what she calls existential individualism. The work focuses specifically on the similarities and differences of these political philosophies by critically examining the liberal feminist writings of John Stuart Mill, Betty Friedan, Simone de Beauvoir and Janet Radcliffe Richards, especially focusing on the issues of employment, education, marriage and the family and governmental politics. In turn, these works are compared to the anarcha-feminism of Emma Goldman."]}, {"page": "List of feminist literature", "response": ["*The Sceptical Feminist: A Philosophical Enquiry, Janet Radcliffe Richards (1980)"]}, {"page": "List of women philosophers", "response": ["*Janet Radcliffe Richards (born 1944)"]}, {"page": "The Politics of Individualism", "response": ["Next Brown looks at how these ideas of individualism were used in the liberal feminist writings of John Stuart Mill, Betty Friedan, Janet Radcliffe Richards, and Carole Pateman. She finds that the existential individualism expressed in some passages of these authors writings are effectively countered by notions of instrumental individualism contained elsewhere. Next she looks at how individualism was used by anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, and sees them as maintaining a consistency of existential individualism. However, she sees this as being less the case for other anarchists, including Pierre Proudhon, Peter Kropotkin, Mikhail Bakunin, and Murray Bookchin, who, rather than seeing individuals as existentially free to create their own destiny, devise other means to explain why such a society would work. For instance, she criticizes Kropotkin and Bakunin's efforts to define human nature as innately cooperative as unnecessary, seeing human nature as inexistent or as socially developed. Brown sees existentialism as a better alternative, because it allows anarchists \"to shift the grounds of debate away from 'human nature' with all its attendant problems, toward a consideration of how we can create freedom for ourselves and others.\" She next looks at the existentialist works of Simone de Beauvoir, seeing her overall notion of the world as created by human individuals as compatible with anarchism."]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Janet Radcliffe Richards (born 1944)"]}, {"page": "Henrietta Barnett School", "response": ["* Janet Radcliffe Richards, philosopher"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Janet Radcliffe Richards (born 1944)"]}, {"page": "Richards (surname)", "response": ["*Janet Radcliffe Richards, British feminist philosopher"]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Janet Radcliffe Richards"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford", "response": ["*Janet Radcliffe Richards"]}, {"page": "British Society for Ethical Theory", "response": ["*2017: Clifton Hill House, University of Bristol.
