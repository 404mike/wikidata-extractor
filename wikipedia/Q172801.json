Using this vehicle he participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix: the British Grand Prix on 17 July 1954. He spun out of the race, scoring no championship points. In addition to this he competed in a number of non-Championship Formula One and Formula Libre races, including a victory in the 1954 I Cornwall MRC Formula 1 Race.\nRiseley-Prichard shared an Aston Martin in the infamous 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race with Tony Brooks, but after the trauma of this event retired from race driving. Later in the same year, he let Brooks take the wheel of his Connaught, giving the future Vanwall and Ferrari star his first big break.Later in life, Riseley-Prichard became the centre of a child pornography scandal, and he emigrated to Thailand. After a lengthy illness he died in Baan Kai Thuan, a remote village approximately 200 kilometres (120 miles) inland of Bangkok.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1954 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  John Riseley-Prichard", "|  John Riseley-Prichard"]}, {"page": "1954 Formula One season", "response": ["|  John Riseley-Prichard", "|align=\"left\"|  John Riseley-Prichard", "|  John Riseley-Prichard"]}, {"page": "John Riseley-Pritchard", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Riseley-Prichard"]}, {"page": "Connaught Engineering", "response": ["| John Riseley-Prichard"]}, {"page": "Rob Walker Racing Team", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  John Riseley-Prichard"]}, {"page": "1955 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["There was great interest for British fans, aside from the Jaguar team.
