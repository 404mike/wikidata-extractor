Although the Canaries dominated the game they failed to make the breakthrough. But Korey Smith struck a goal in the last 20 minutes of the game to send Norwich into second place. After this Norwich never looked back and followed this up with a 3\u20131 win at home to Exeter. Next up was probably one of Norwich's biggest game of the season at Colchester away. After the 7\u20131 defeat on the opening day of the season and Paul Lambert's departure the game was much anticipated. But it was Norwich who gained the ultimate revenge by winning 5\u20130 on an extremely waterlogged pitch. A Chris Martin double put City 2\u20130 up at half time before Gary Doherty, Grant Holt and Oli Johnson made it 5\u20130 and Wes Hoolahan even missed a penalty! Norwich had now also closed the gap on top of the league Leeds and due to their cup commitments City could go top with a win over Brentford. The task was made more difficult after Grant Holt's sending off but they won 1\u20130 thanks to a Chris Martin goal. Norwich were above Leeds on goal difference but Leeds had two games in hand. Norwich got a hard-fought 2\u20131 away win at Walsall with two late goals from Chris Martin and Cody Mcdonald and with Leeds losing it extended City's lead at the top to three points. City ended the month with a 2\u20131 win over Hartlepool meaning they had won 6 games out of 6 in January.", "City got off to a bad start in February, losing 2\u20131 away at Millwall despite taking an early lead \u2013 their first defeat since October, however, they bounced back with a fortunate 2\u20131 win away at Brighton. The Canaries were 1\u20130 down going into the final 10 minutes of the match, before Lambert's gamble of having four strikers on the pitch ultimately paid off as Norwich grabbed two late goals through Holt and Doherty to snatch three vital points. In their next game City again suffered defeat, losing 0-2 to Southampton in what was their first home loss under Paul Lambert, but they had a chance to put it right against their next opponents when struggling Southend came to Carrow Road. Despite their respective league positions, it was Southend who scored first, and indeed were still leading 1\u20130 with only 11 minutes remaining, before super-sub Oli Johnson came on to score two late goals - the winner arriving in the 94th minute - to clinch the game for Norwich in the most dramatic of circumstances. The final game of the month saw the Canaries see out a 1\u20130 win away at Oldham, which - coupled with inconsistent results for their promotion rivals across February - was enough to have built-up a 5-point gap on second-placed Leeds and, crucially, a 9-point gap on third-placed Charlton."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Stockport County F.C. season", "response": ["|11||||FW||Oli Johnson||1||0||0||0|| 1", "Stockport began pre-season with a 0 \u2013 0 away draw against Barrow in Gary Ablett's first match in charge.
