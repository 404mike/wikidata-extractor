Hatch and S. Millward, From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), p. 105. The result has been characterised as blues rock and arguably marked the beginnings of a separation of pop and rock music that was to be a feature of the record industry for several decades. Cream is often seen as the first supergroup, combining the talents of Clapton, Bruce and Baker; they have also been seen as one of the first groups to exploit the power trio. Although only together for a little over two years, from 1966\u201369, they were highly influential and it was in this period that Clapton became an international superstar.R. Unterberger, \"Cream: biography\", Allmusic, retrieved 22 June 2012.

In 1964, The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards began using a sunburst, 1959 Les Paul Standard \u2013 becoming the first \"star-guitarist\" to play a Les Paul on the British scene. The guitar, outfitted with a Bigsby tailpiece, served as one of the guitarist's prominent instruments and provided the first impetus to the use of Les Pauls during the British blues boom. In 1965, Eric Clapton began using Les Pauls because of the influence of Freddie King and Hubert Sumlin, and played a 1960 Standard on the groundbreaking album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton. In America, Mike Bloomfield began using a 1954 Les Paul goldtop while touring with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and recorded most of his work on the band's East-West album with that guitar.
