He is best known for describing the paradox of fiction in the 1975 essay \"How Can We Be Moved by the Fate of Anna Karenina?\" and developing the paradox in a number of subsequent essays.Radford was a pupil at Thornbury Grammar School, then studied at London School of Economics and the University of Bristol. He studied for a doctorate under Gilbert Ryle at the University of Oxford before taking a position at the University of Kent, where he taught until his retirement in 1992. He was a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Illinois, and Queensland University.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Malet Armstrong", "response": ["Armstrong presents a response to Colin Radford's modified version of the \"unconfident examinee\" example. A student is asked when Queen Elizabeth I died, and he hesitatingly answers \"1603\" and exhibits no confidence in his answer. He has forgotten that at some point previously, he studied English history. Radford presents this as an example of knowledge without belief. But Armstrong differs on this: the unconfident examinee has a belief that Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, he knows that she died in 1603, but he does not know that he knows. Armstrong rejects the KK Principle\u2014that to know some thing p, one must know that one knows p. Armstrong's rejection of the KK Principle is consistent with his wider externalist project."]}, {"page": "Paradox of fiction", "response": ["The paradox of fiction, or the paradox of emotional response to fiction, is a philosophical dilemma that questions how people can experience strong emotions to fictional things. The primary question asked is the following: How are people moved by things which do not exist? The paradox draws upon a set of three premises that seem to be true prima facie but upon closer inspection produce a contradiction. Although the ontology of fictional things in general has been discussed in philosophy since Plato, the paradox was first suggested by Colin Radford and Michael Weston in their 1975 paper How Can We Be Moved by the Fate of Anna Karenina?. Since Radford and Weston's original paper, they and others have continued the discussion by giving the problem slightly differing formulations and solutions.", "In 1975, philosophers Colin Radford and Michael Weston published their paper How Can We Be Moved by the Fate of Anna Karenina? In it, Radford and Weston discuss the idea of emotional responses to fiction, drawing upon the character Anna Karenina from Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina. Their central inquiry is how people can be moved by things that do not exist. In their paper, they concluded that our emotional responses to fiction are irrational. In 1978, American philosopher Kendall Walton published the paper Fearing Fictions, in which he addresses Radford and Weston's paradox. This paper served as the impetus for Walton's Make-believe theory, his major contribution to philosophy. The conversation that Radford, Weston, and Walton started on the topic of emotional responses to fiction has continued and evolved to this day."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2001", "response": ["*Colin Radford, 66, English philosopher."]}]}}
