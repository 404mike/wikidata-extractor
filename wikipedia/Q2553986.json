Yoko Ono had been deeply involved in the production and had herself been initially impressed with his audition and approved his casting prior to discovering his full name was Mark Lindsay Chapman. She then nixed his casting on the grounds it was \"bad karma\", and a great deal of press attention was given to his having almost gotten the role. The director of Chapter 27, Jarrett Schaefer, auditioned many Lennon impersonators, but was especially impressed with Mark Lindsay Chapman's tape because he conveyed the \"tough town\" street-smart quality of Lennon that the impersonators failed to convey, as they always played Lennon as larger-than-life. Schaefer described Lennon as having a \"chip on his shoulder and always cracking these cynical one-liners\", and felt that actor Chapman was best at conveying this quality. Schaefer had some difficulty negotiating the casting with the film's producers because of Chapman's name. After Chapman was cast, he asked Chapman how he should be billed to which Chapman replied \"Mark fucking Lindsay Chapman. That's my fucking name.\" Schaefer remarks that this was so reflective of how Lennon talked, it just reinforced his sense that Chapman was right for the part."]}, {"page": "Henry Tingle Wilde", "response": ["*Mark Lindsay Chapman (1997) (Titanic)"]}, {"page": "List of films at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival", "response": ["|colspan=\"6\"| Starring Jared Leto, Judah Friedlander, Lindsay Lohan, Mark Lindsay Chapman"]}, {"page": "Swamp Thing (1990 TV series)", "response": ["The series also introduced characters like the Kipp family, as well as a completely new incarnation of Anton Arcane played by Mark Lindsay Chapman.

Consequently, the story had Jim Kipp abducted by a South American child-stealing ring acting under Arcane's orders, and Jim never appeared again in the series.
