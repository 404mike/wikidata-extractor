For other people named \"John Bolton,\" see John Bolton (disambiguation).\n\nJohn Gatenby Bolton  (5 June 1922 \u2013 6 July 1993) was a British-Australian astronomer who was fundamental to the development of radio astronomy. In particular, Bolton was integral in establishing that discrete radio sources were either galaxies or the remnants of supernovae, rather than stars. He also played a significant role in the discovery of quasars and the centre of the Milky Way. Bolton served as the inaugural director of the Parkes radio telescope in Australia and established the Owens Valley Radio Observatory in California. Bolton's students held directorships at most of the radio observatories in the world and one was a Nobel Prize winner. Bolton is considered a key figure in the development of astronomy in Australia.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| John Gatenby Bolton || UK/Australia || 1922 || 1993", "*John Gatenby Bolton (UK/Australia, 1922\u20131993)"]}, {"page": "Centaurus A", "response": ["In 1949 John Gatenby Bolton, Bruce Slee and Gordon Stanley localized NGC\u00a05128 as one of the first extragalactic radio sources. Five years later, Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski suggested that the peculiar structure is the result of a merge event of a giant elliptical galaxy and a small spiral galaxy. The first detection of X-ray emissions, using a sounding rocket, was performed in 1970. In 1975\u201376 gamma-ray emissions from Centaurus A were observed through the atmospheric Cerenkov technique."]}, {"page": "Halton Arp", "response": ["During the 1950s bright radio sources, now known as quasars, had been discovered that did not appear to have an optical counterpart. In 1960 one of these sources, 3C 48, was found to be associated with what appeared to be a small blue star. When the spectrum of the star was measured, it contained unidentifiable spectral lines that defied all attempts at explanation; John Gatenby Bolton's suggestion that these were highly redshifted sources was not widely accepted. In 1963 Maarten Schmidt found a visible companion to the quasar 3C 273. Using the Hale telescope, Schmidt found the same odd spectra, but was able to demonstrate that it could be explained as the spectrum of hydrogen, shifted by a very large 15.8% If this was due to the physical motion of the \"star\", it would represent a speed of 47,000\u00a0km/s, far beyond the speed of any known star and defying an obvious explanation. Schmidt noted that redshift is also associated with the expansion of the universe, as codified in Hubble's law. If the measured redshift was due to expansion, then the object in question would have to be very far away, and therefore have an extraordinarily high luminosity, equally beyond any object seen to date. This extreme luminosity would also explain the large radio signal. Schmidt concluded quasars are very distant, very luminous objects. Schmidt's explanation for the high redshift was not universally accepted at the time. Another explanation that was offered was that it was gravitational redshift that was being measured. Several other mechanisms were proposed as well, each with their own problems."]}, {"page": "Parkes Observatory", "response": ["* John Gatenby Bolton"]}, {"page": "John G.
