This duality of offices reflected the coalition nature of Sinn F\u00e9in between those of the constitutional tradition, and those who advocated a more militarist approach. Shortly after, Figgis was one of four recently released internees who travelled to the South Longford constituency to campaign for Joseph McGuinness in the by-election caused by the death of John Phillips. The overwhelming victory of the Sinn F\u00e9in candidate over the Irish Parliamentary Party nominee marked the beginning of the eclipse of the latter party by the former party.
