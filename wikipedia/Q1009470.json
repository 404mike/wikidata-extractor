He was admitted to membership in the Royal College of Surgeons in 1801.  As army surgeon, he served in the Peninsular campaign, and his work there won the praise of the Duke of Wellington.  In 1816 he began a series of lectures in surgery to the officers of the army and navy, which he continued for nearly 30 years. In 1824 he became a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, of which he was three times president, and also professor in 1818\u20131831. His principal works are:  \n\nOn Gunshot Wounds of the Extremities Requiring the Different Operations of Amputations, and their After Treatment (1814; sixth edition, 1855)\nLectures on the Operative Surgery of the Eye (1823; third edition, 1838)\nOn the Anatomy and Diseases of the Urinary and Sexual Organs (third edition, 1843)\nCommentaries on the Surgery of the War in Portugal, Spain, France, and the Netherlands (sixth edition, 1862 (2021))", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal College of Surgeons of England", "response": ["| George James Guthrie || 1854", "| George James Guthrie || 1841", "| George James Guthrie || 1833"]}, {"page": "George Guthrie", "response": ["*George James Guthrie (1785\u20131856), English surgeon"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| George James Guthrie||24/05/1827||1 May 1785 - 1 May 1856"]}, {"page": "Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway", "response": ["Two weeks later William Whatton replied. He disputed Weatherill's claim that the only action taken to staunch the blood flow had been the handkerchief, and pointed out that his first action on arrival at Eccles vicarage had been to seal Huskisson's femoral artery. He stated that he had great experience with similar injuries from his time as an army doctor during the Peninsular War, and that \"none of them [military surgeons] would have ventured upon an operation where the chances were so decidedly against its success\". He pointed out that the survival rate for amputations among soldiers with similar injuries\u2014considerably healthier than the elderly Huskisson\u2014was no better than 15% when attempted immediately after the injury. Instead, he cited the advice of leading surgeon George James Guthrie that amputation was not generally survivable until the patient's pulse had stabilised and the initial shock settled. Whatton pointed out that Huskisson's pulse did not stabilise and that he was in convulsions for the entire time Whatton attended him."]}, {"page": "Charles Fergusson Forbes", "response": ["In 1816 he was appointed physician to the newly founded Royal Westminster Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye in Warwick Street, Golden Square, having George James Guthrie as his surgical colleague. In 1827 a difference of opinion arose between Forbes and Guthrie as to the treatment of inflammatory affections of the eye; the subject was noticed in The Lancet adversely to Guthrie, who began an action for libel against the journal, but abandoned it on learning that Forbes had been subpoenaed as a witness. Having been insulted at the hospital by one Hale Thomson, a young surgeon in Guthrie's party, Forbes challenged Thomson to a duel. It was fought with pistols on Clapham Common at half-past three in the afternoon of 29 December 1827; when each had fired twice without effect, the seconds interposed, but another encounter was demanded by the principals, which was also harmless. The seconds then declared the duel at an end, against the wishes of the parties."]}, {"page": "Hunterian Oration", "response": ["*1830 George James Guthrie"]}, {"page": "Joseph Graeme Humble", "response": ["Humble\u2019s hobby was medical history and he published a history of Westminster Hospital Medical School and a biography of George James Guthrie, founder of the school and a Peninsula Army surgeon under Wellington."]}]}}
