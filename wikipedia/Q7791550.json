Cooke's Pocket Edition of English Poets (1796-8) was especially popular, and Kirk's illustrations impressed many of his contemporaries. Edward Dayes said of him: 'He passed like a meteor through the region of art'.\nOriginal drawings by him are rare, often in oval format, and owe much to the influence of Kauffman. The draughtsmanship is of the highest quality and some his pictures are described as 'ornamented' by R. W. Satchwell, who occasionally drew the surrounds.\nHis promising career was cut short by illness. Working to the end, he died in 1797 of consumption (i.e. tuberculosis), having exhibited his final works at the Royal Academy (Evening and A Dream) the previous year. His last known address was 8 Judd Place West, New Road (renamed Euston Road in 1857), London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Titus Andronicus", "response": ["thumb|right|upright=0.70|Thomas Kirk illustration of Young Lucius fleeing from Lavinia in Act 4, Scene 1; engraved by B.
