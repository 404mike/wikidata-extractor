Watkins, the strip first appeared on 8 March 1936. Watkins continued to draw Oor Wullie until his death in 1969, after which the Post recycled his work into the 1970s. New strips were eventually commissioned from Tom Lavery, followed by Peter Davidson and Robert Nixon. Ken H. Harrison drew the strip from 1989 until 1997, when Davidson resumed duties. Between January 2005 and 2006 storylines were written by broadcaster Tom Morton from his home in Shetland, and subsequently they were written by Dave Donaldson, managing director of Thomson's comics division. The current writer is former Dandy editor Morris Heggie."]}, {"page": "The Broons", "response": ["Watkins drew the strip from his Broughty Ferry home until his death in 1969. For five years after Watkins' death, D. C. Thomson recycled old strips in the newspaper and annuals, fearing no adequate replacement could be found to match Watkins' unique style. In these repeated strips, some particularly Scots words were replaced (e.g., 'ahint' became 'behind') and the pre-decimal coinage was updated. Peter Davidson is the current artist, succeeding Ken H. Harrison. This is Davidson's second stint as artist, the first being in the early 1980s. BBC Radio Scotland presenter Tom Morton was the scriptwriter until 2006 when Dave Donaldson took over. Morris Heggie, former editor of The Dandy is the current writer."]}, {"page": "BBC Radio Scotland", "response": ["*Tom Morton (music)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* Tom Morton, journalist and broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Thomas Morton", "response": ["* Tom Morton (born 1955), Scottish journalist, author and BBC Radio Scotland broadcaster"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Tom Morton, broadcaster and musician"]}, {"page": "Tartan Heart Festival", "response": ["*Tom Morton"]}, {"page": "Marr College", "response": ["*Tom Morton, writer and broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["Tom Mortonnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Kid Canaveral", "response": ["Upon the re-release of Shouting at Wildlife by Fence Records the Glasgow Herald described the album as \"a Scottish pop classic [that] should be mandatory in every record collection in the country\" and Vic Galloway and Tom Morton featured it as their 'Album of the Week' on their respective BBC Radio Scotland shows, in its week of release."]}, {"page": "Shouting at Wildlife", "response": ["Upon the re-release of Shouting at Wildlife by Fence Records, the Glasgow Herald described the album as \"a Scottish pop classic [that] should be mandatory in every record collection in the country\" and Vic Galloway and Tom Morton featured it as their 'Album of the Week' on their respective BBC Radio Scotland shows, in its week of release."]}, {"page": "The Botanist", "response": ["Tom Morton described Ugly Betty in his book Spirit of Adventure as \"An oversized, upside-down dustbin made of copper\".Trip Advisor, Bruichladdich; retrieved: 05-09-2018.
