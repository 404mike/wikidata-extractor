Morony states that:[The emergence of] protected status and the definition of jizya as the poll tax on non-Muslim subjects appears to have been achieved only by the early eighth century. This came as a result of growing suspicions about the loyalty of the non-Muslim population during the second civil war and of the literalist interpretation of the Quran by pious Muslims.Jane Dammen McAuliffe states that jizya, in early Islamic texts, was an annual tribute expected from non-Muslims, and not a poll tax.Jane Dammen McAuliffe (2011), Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Brill Academic, Vol. 4, pp. 152-153; Vol. 5, pp. 192\u20133, . Similarly, Thomas Walker Arnold writes that jizya originally denoted tribute of any type paid by the non-Muslim subjects of the Arab empire, but that it came later on to be used for the capitation-tax, \"as the fiscal system of the new rulers became fixed.\" (online)", "In accordance with this order, enormous sums were paid back out of the state treasury, and the Christians called down blessings on the heads of the Muslims, saying, \"May God give you rule over us again and make you victorious over the Romans; had it been they, they would not have given us back anything, but would have taken all that remained with us.\" Similarly, during the time of the Crusades, Saladin returned the jizya to the Christians of Syria when he was compelled to retract from it.

In the case of war, jizya is seen as an option to end hostilities. According to Abu Kalam Azad, one of the main objectives of jizya was to facilitate a peaceful solution to hostility, since non-Muslims who engaged in fighting against Muslims were thereby given the option of making peace by agreeing to pay jizya. In this sense, jizya is seen as a means by which to legalize the cessation of war and military conflict with non-Muslims.Mun'im Sirry (2014), Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions, p. 178. Oxford University Press. . In a similar vein, Mahmud Shaltut states that \"jizya was never intended as payment in return for one's life or retaining one's religion, it was intended as a symbol to signify yielding, an end of hostility and a participation in shouldering the burdens of the state.\""]}, {"page": "Ottoman Greece", "response": ["As a rule, the Ottomans did not require the Greeks to become Muslims, although many did so on a superficial level in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman ruleCrypto-Christians of the Trabzon Region of Pontos or because of the alleged corruption of the Greek clergy.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 143 The regions of Greece which had the largest concentrations of Ottoman Greek Muslims were Macedonia, notably the Vallaades, neighboring Epirus, and Crete (see Cretan Muslims).

There is no compulsion in religion addresses those in a position of strength, not weakness.

Quote: \"While the pope, following many anti-Islam propagandists, seemingly argues that the oft-cited Quranic dictum \"no compulsion in religion\" was abrogated by subsequent revelations, this is not the mainstream Muslim interpretation. Indeed, the pope made a major scholarly blunder when he claimed that the \"no compulsion in religion\" verse was revealed during the Meccan period, \"when Mohammed was still powerless and under threat.\" In fact, it was revealed during the later Medinan period--the same period as the verses that authorize armed struggle against the Meccan enemies of the nascent Muslim community in Medina, that is, \"when Muhammad was in a position of strength, not weakness.\"\" (emphasis added) including Ibn Taymiyya,Ibn Taymiyya, Q\u0101\u02bfidah Mukhta\u1e63arah f\u012b Qit\u0101l al-Kuff\u0101r wa Muh\u0101danatihim wa Ta\u1e25r\u012bm Qatlihim li-Mujarrad Kufrihim: Q\u0101\u02bfidah Tubayyn al-Qiyam al-S\u0101miyah lil-Ha\u1e0d\u0101rah al-Isl\u0101miyyah f\u012b al-Harb wa al-Qit\u0101l, p.123.

Constable. Quote: \"Forcible conversion was forbidden, in accordance with the precepts of the Qur'an : \u2014 \" Let there be no compulsion in religion \" (ii. 257). \" Wilt thou compel men to become believers ? No soul can believe but by the permission of God \" (x. 99, 100). The very existence of so many Christian sects and communities in countries that have been for centuries under Muhammadan rule is an abiding testimony to the toleration they have enjoyed, and shows that the persecutions they have from time to time been called upon to endure at the hands of bigots and fanatics, have been excited by some special and local circumstances rather than inspired by a settled principle of intolerance.\"", "It is reported that Mujahid said that \"This verse was revealed about a man of the Helpers [Ansar of Medina] who had a black boy called Subayh whom he used to coerce to become Muslim\".  In addition scholar argue, no single phrase or verse in Quran is less or more relevant in Islam than other phrases or verses in Quran; and other verses in Quran such as verse 66 of At-Tawba state \"Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are in sin.\", As well as \"Say, \"The truth is from your Lord\": Let him who will believe, and let him who will, reject (it): ...\",. \"And if your Lord had pleased, surely all those who are in the earth would have believed, all of them; will you then force men till they become believers?\",. \"Therefore do remind, for you are only a reminder. You are not a watcher over them;\",, . \"He said: \"O my people! See ye if (it be that) I have a Clear Sign from my Lord, and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from His own presence, but that the Mercy hath been obscured from your sight? shall we compel you to accept it when ye are averse to it?\".. According to some western scholars, in the history of Islamic exegesis scholarship, that verse is considered as an early revelation, and abrogated by verses that were revealed to Muhammad at a later stage in his life.Peters & De Vries (1976), Apostasy in Islam, Die Welt des Islams, Vol. 17, Issue 1/4, pp 15 (footnote 38) However, as stated by the famous British orientalist Sir Thomas Walker Arnold the verse in question is a Medinan verse, when Muslims lived in their period of political ascendance. Moreover, Muslim scholars have established the abrogated verses and Q.2:256 isn't among them. Finally, to understand the Quran, the sayings and actions of Muhammad as recorded in Hadith collections are considered by Islamic scholars. Taken together, the vast majority of Islamic scholars of every fiqh have traditionally held with the position that there should be punishment for apostasy in Islam.Abdul Rashied Omar (2009), \"The Right to Religious Conversion: Between Apostasy and Proselytization\", in Peace-Building by, between, and beyond Muslim and Evangelical Christians, Editors: Abu-Nimer, Mohammed and David Augsburger, Lexington, pages 179-194"]}, {"page": "Pact of Umar", "response": ["According to Thomas Walker Arnold, the pact \"is in harmony\" with Umar's \"kindly consideration for his subjects of another faith, (https://dl.wdl.org/17553/service/17553.pdf])"]}, {"page": "Margaret Smith (author)", "response": ["Smith counted among her mentors Thomas Walker Arnold, Alfred Guillaume, R.
