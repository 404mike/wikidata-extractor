Whilst challenging with Pedro Mendes for a loose ball Thatcher viciously and intentionally led with his elbow, knocking Mendes into the advertising hoardings rendering him unconscious. Mendes required oxygen at pitchside and suffered a seizure while being transferred to hospital, where he spent the night. Mendes was discharged from hospital the next day, but remained under medical supervision. Thatcher was not sent off by referee Dermot Gallagher but given just a yellow card, but he was investigated by the FA as a result of the challenge. He was disciplined and his barrister, Rupert Bowers, read a written apology following the hearing. Greater Manchester Police noted receipt of many \"statements of complaint\" and also chose to investigate the matter. On 30 August, Manchester City announced that Thatcher would be banned for six matches, two of which would be suspended, and fined six weeks' wages for the challenge. This punishment is separate from the sanctions made by the FA, who suspended Thatcher for eight matches, with a further fifteen game suspended ban for two years. Mendes shook hands with Thatcher pre-match when they next faced one another in January 2007, despite claiming beforehand that he would not do so."]}, {"page": "Paul White, Baron Hanningfield", "response": ["In October 2011, Hanningfield began a legal action against Essex Police for wrongful arrest on suspicion of fraudulent use of a county council credit card, a few days after he had been released from prison. He sent a letter before the claim informing them that he was seeking \u00a33,000 for unlawful arrest and detention, \u00a31,500 for trespass, and \u00a32,000 in costs. In February 2013 he was awarded \u00a33,500 damages for unlawful arrest and the search of his home without a search warrant. He was represented by the barrister Rupert Bowers.", "In May 2014 it was announced that Hanningfield would likely be suspended from Parliament over the incident, and he was subsequently temporarily suspended from the House of Lords. His suspension ended in May 2015. Again represented by Rupert Bowers, the case was ultimately dropped when Parliament claimed privilege over the matters indicted."]}]}}
