Dent 1955). This skill set was necessary for exposing all trainees during the last week of the commando (green beret) course. Instructors publicly demonstrated (e.g. at Navy Days) commando methods of abseiling and high-speed fixed rope descent from clifftop grapple-hook anchors. These would typically include the 'run-down' method (a simple face down arm wrap, sometimes demonstrated on high urban buildings, and essential when carrying small arms) and the 'front swallow' and other dangerous slides down a fixed rope. These demonstrations were discontinued after Captain Antony Easterbrook, a 31-year-old member of the Cadre, fell to his death during a display in Madison Square Garden in 1960."]}, {"page": "Michael Banks", "response": ["Michael or Mike Banks may refer to:", "* Mike Banks (musician), American techno producer", "* Mike Banks (mountaineer) (1922\u20132013), British climber and mountaineer", "* Mike Banks (American football) (born 1979), former American football tight end"]}, {"page": "Banks (surname)", "response": ["*Mike Banks (musician), techno musician", "*Mike Banks (mountaineer) (1922\u20132013), British mountain climber"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Mike Banks, 90, mountaineer and Royal Marines officer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2013", "response": ["*Mike Banks, 90, British mountaineer and Royal Marines officer.Michael \"Mike\" Banks, British mountaineer, dies at age 90"]}, {"page": "Joss Lynam", "response": ["In 1991, Lynam and British climber Mike Banks were joint leaders in a veteran mountaineering trip to Jaonli peak in India, where an earthquake struck nearby within the proximity of only 15\u00a0km.
