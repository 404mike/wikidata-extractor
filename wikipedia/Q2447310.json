He gained valuable drumming experience as part of the Cliftons in 1960, then jammed with an early line-up of the Rolling Stones before they settled on their permanent band members. He appeared with the band in 1962, including a performance at Sidcup Art College, Bexley, which Keith Richards had attended, and was reputedly the drummer at the first official performance of the group, on 12 July 1962 at the Marquee Club in London yet Chapman himself, later cast doubt that he had appeared at the Marquee.\nChapman was the person through whom Bill Wyman was enlisted to the Stones, having been in Wyman's band The Cliftons. It was Chapman who made inquiries about vacancies with the Stones and discovered they might be found at the Wetherby Arms on the King's Road, Chelsea. He and Wyman turned up for a run-through and although they had doubts about the blues style and did not like the name, agreed to join. Another drummer, Steve Harris, also sat in for some sessions \u2013 Charlie Watts was still with Alexis Korner. Chapman felt that he did not fit in with the way-out approach, of the group for the time and left to play drums for the Alphabeats before leaving to form a band called The Preachers. Wyman remained to join the Rolling Stones, when Watts took over as their permanent drummer.Chapman's group, the Preachers had a less wild approach and he wrote one side of their only single \"Too Old In The Head\" the flip side of \"Hole In The Soul.\" The Preachers was one of the first bands that 16 year old Peter Frampton appeared in and was being produced and managed by Bill Wyman. Chapman was responsible for the first meeting between Wyman and Frampton in 1966. After The Preachers, Chapman went on to play drums in The Herd, where he was a member for the first two years until 1966 (replaced by Andrew Steele) again with Peter Frampton, and also with Andy Bown (later of Status Quo) and others. Chapman disappeared to the United States soon after.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Rolling Stones", "response": ["Jones, no longer in a band, advertised for bandmates in Jazz Weekly the week of 2 May 1962. Ian Stewart, the first to respond to the ad, found them a practice space; together they decided to form a band playing Chicago blues. In June, Jagger, Taylor and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart. The first rehearsal included guitarist Geoff Bradford and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom decided not to join the band. They objected to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards. That same month the addition of the drummer Tony Chapman completed the line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart and Taylor. According to Richards, Jones named the band during a phone call to Jazz News. When asked by a journalist for the band's name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor; one of the tracks was \"Rollin' Stone\".", "* Tony Chapmandrums (1962\u20131963)"]}, {"page": "Mick Jagger", "response": ["In their earliest days, the Rolling Stones played for no money in the interval of Alexis Korner's gigs at a basement club opposite London's Ealing Broadway tube station (subsequently called \"Ferry's\" club). The group had very little equipment and borrowed Korner's gear to play. The group's first appearance, under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite Muddy Waters tunes), was at the Marquee Club, a London jazz club, on 12\u00a0July 1962. They would later change their name to \"the Rolling Stones\" as it seemed more formal. Writer Victor Bockris says the band members included Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Ian Stewart on piano, Dick Taylor on bass and Tony Chapman on drums. However, Richards says in his memoir Life that \"The drummer that night was Mick Avory\u2013not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down...\" In June 1963, the band began a five month residency at Eel Pie Island Hotel, which the BBC later credited with shaping the band's career. By that autumn, Jagger had left the London School of Economics to pursue his promising musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group played songs by American rhythm and blues artists like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but strongly encouraged by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write songs. Their songwriting partnership took some time to develop; one of their early compositions was \"As Tears Go By\", a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting.  For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write \"The Last Time\", the group's third number one single in the UK (their first two UK number one hits being remakes of songs that had been recorded by other artists \"It's All Over Now\" by Bobby Womack and \"Little Red Rooster\" by Willie Dixon) based on \"This May Be the Last Time\", a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Jagger and Richards also wrote their first international hit, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". It established the Rolling Stones' image as defiant troublemakers in contrast to the Beatles as \"lovable moptop[s]\".left|thumb|alt=Portrait of Jagger holding a cigarette in his right hand looking directly at the camera |Jagger in 1965 Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: I wasn't trying to be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from suburbia who sings in this band, but someone older might have thought it was just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame."]}, {"page": "Brian Jones", "response": ["As Richards tells it, Jones came up with the name the \"Rollin' Stones\" (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner. \"The voice on the other end of the line obviously said, 'What are you called?' Panic! The Best of Muddy Waters album was lying on the floor\u2014and track five, side one was 'Rollin' Stone Blues'\". The Rollin' Stones played their first gig on 12 July 1962 at the Marquee Club in London, with a line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, bass player Dick Taylor (later of the Pretty Things) and drummer Tony Chapman.Some sources including Keith Richards erroneously list Mick Avory as the drummer at that gig, but Avory himself denies it.", "The four Rollin' Stones went searching for a bassist and drummer, finally settling on Bill Wyman on bass because he had a spare VOX AC30 guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes, as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself. After playing with Mick Avory, Tony Chapman and Carlo Little, in January 1963 they finally persuaded jazz-influenced Charlie Watts to join them. At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London; he had played with (among others) Alexis Korner's group Blues Incorporated."]}, {"page": "Bill Wyman", "response": ["When drummer Tony Chapman told him that a rhythm and blues band called the Rolling Stones needed a bass player, he auditioned at a pub in Chelsea on 7 December 1962 and was hired as a successor to Dick Taylor.

After leaving that group, he was asked twice to rehearse on drums at the Bricklayers Arms pub in London during late May/early June 1962 for a group of musicians who were later to become the Rolling Stones.
