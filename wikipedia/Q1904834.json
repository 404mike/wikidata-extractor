They are divided into two lines of ten ranks \u2013 the same number as that of the Attic tribes.The Athenian cavalry was organised by tribe of phylai and commanded by ten officers known as phlyarchs All figures are beardless youths with the exception of two, W8 and W15, who along with S2\u20137 wear Thracian dress of fur cap, a patterned cloak, and high boots; these have been identified by Martin Robertson as hipparchs.Robertson, Frantz, 1975, p.46 Next are the four-horse chariots, each with charioteer and armed passenger, there are ten on the south frieze and eleven on the north. Since these passengers are sometimes depicted as dismounting they may be taken to represent the apobatai, participants in the ceremonial race found in Attica and Boeotia.Kyle, 1993, see Neils, 2001, p.138", "Interpretations of the figures varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are arranged in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, with the exception of Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31\u201335; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads,Either baskets, Wesenberg, 1995, or stools, Boardman, 1999, pp.305\u2013330 while a third, perhaps a boy,Brommer,1977, pp.269\u201370 may identify the existence of a temple boy of Athena in Athens, see also Harrison, The Web of History: A conservative reading of the Parthenon Frieze in Neils, 1996, p.204 assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena\u2019s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.While it is largely uncontroversial (pace Connelly) that this scene is the presentation of the peplos, since that was the purpose of the Panathenaic procession, the identification of these figures is not. It may be that the two girls, E 31-2, are the diphrophoroi, metic girls who carried the stools for the kanephoroi, but Neils, 2001, p.168 dismisses this argument since they evidently play a central role in the cult of Athena here. She also notes that the arrephoroi were involved in the weaving of the peplos, specifically warping the looms for it during the festival of Chalkeia nine months earlier. The figure E35 was identified as a girl by Stuart and Revett, an ascription repudiated by Adolf Michaelis in 1871. That this figure was a boy was the orthodox interpretation until Martin Robertson pointed out the presence of venus rings on her neck, Robertson, Frantz, 1975.
