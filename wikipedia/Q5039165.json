Having had a late start to his career, he mainly worked as a miniaturist, composing short orchestral scores and humorous pieces such as Return of Bulgy Gogo, Up the Faringdon Road, Mock Joplin and Saxe Blue; in addition, he assisted Benjamin Britten as a music editor.\nBlyton wrote incidental music for three stories in the BBC Doctor Who television series: Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970), Death to the Daleks (1974), and Revenge of the Cybermen (1975). He was noted for his use of primitive musical instruments, using Crumhorns to depict the Silurians in Doctor Who and the Silurians, and serpents and ophicleides in Revenge of the Cybermen. Several CDs of his work were produced, notably Sherlock Holmes meets Dr Who, showcasing his work for an unmade Sherlock Holmes animated series, cues from all three of his Doctor Who stories, and other classics such as Saxe Blue.\nHis career was prolific, and he died in Suffolk, aged 70.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doctor Who", "response": ["The incidental music for the first Doctor Who adventure, An Unearthly Child, was written by Norman Kay. Many of the stories of the William Hartnell period were scored by electronic music pioneer Tristram Cary, whose Doctor Who credits include The Daleks, Marco Polo, The Daleks' Master Plan, The Gunfighters and The Mutants. Other composers in this early period included Richard Rodney Bennett, Carey Blyton and Geoffrey Burgon."]}, {"page": "Enid Blyton", "response": ["Enid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, United Kingdom, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870\u20131920), a cutlery salesman (recorded in the 1911 census with the occupation of \"Mantle Manufacturer dealer [in] women's suits, skirts, etc.\") and his wife Theresa Mary (n\u00e9e Harrison; 1874\u20131950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899\u20131983) and Carey (1902\u20131976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached house in Beckenham, then a village in Kent. A few months after her birth, Enid almost died from whooping cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he \"loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met\". He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature, and theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits. Enid was devastated when he left the family shortly after her 13th birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals."]}, {"page": "BBC Radiophonic Workshop", "response": ["**Revenge of the Cybermen (additional, uncredited music by Peter Howell (main score by Carey Blyton))"]}, {"page": "Langley Park School for Boys", "response": ["* Carey Blyton, composer of Bananas in Pyjamas"]}, {"page": "Bananas in Pyjamas", "response": ["The concept was inspired by the success of the song Bananas in Pyjamas, written by Carey Blyton in 1967, on Play School.

The jaunty song describes (an unspecified number of) bananas in pyjamas chasing teddy bears, with a slight twist at the end where a musical sting emphasises that the bananas like to \"catch them unawares\". The song was shown on the Australian version of Play School for many years accompanied by an animation depicting pairs of bananas in blue-and-white striped pyjamas. This led to a \"banana\" plush toy being created as part of the \"toy cast\", which formed the basis of the physical appearance of B1 and B2."]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Carey Blyton || 1932 ||2002 ||  British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Doctor Who and the Silurians", "response": ["The incidental music for the serial was composed by Carey Blyton, who would also contribute music for Death to the Daleks (1974) and Revenge of the Cybermen (1975).", "Mark Braxton of Radio Times wrote that the story had \"quality in spades\", especially in the location filming, and that the story was \"gritty\" and \"provocative\" with \"fine character actors\". He praised the design and the voice-acting of the Silurians but felt their rubber costume on-screen made them come across as \"silly\". Braxton was also disappointed with other production \"shortcomings\", such as the \"cheap-looking\" cave set, the dinosaur, and \"Carey Blyton's electro-bagpiped Silurian theme\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn wrote that it \"keeps a snappy pace throughout thanks to Malcolm Hulke's well-plotted script\". He noted that both the monsters and the humans were more complex than previously seen on Doctor Who. Like Braxton, he also felt the serial was \"badly served by the Silurian costumes, which are terrible even by the standards of low-budget, 1970s TV\". DVD Talk's John Sinnott noted that some parts were \"a bit slow\" due to the length, but it was a \"mature\" story where Pertwee defined his Doctor. However, Sinnott felt that John was still trying to find her character's place, and did not have much chemistry with Pertwee. Den of Geek gave a positive review of the serial, writing that \"the production is only marred by its excessive number of episodes compared to the story it had to tell ... and an often-appalling 'medieval' score by experimentalist Carey Blyton\". In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed Episode Six's cliffhanger as one of the best in all of Doctor Who. Anders listed the serial as a good example of the early Pertwee years, calling it \"pretty fantastic\" with enemies who \"aren't just one-dimensional baddies\" and the length \"somewhat justified by a harrowing subplot where a plague starts killing people all across London\"."]}, {"page": "Revenge of the Cybermen", "response": ["Carey Blyton composed the incidental music for this serial, his final work for the series.
