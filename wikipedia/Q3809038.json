He moved in December 1948 to Leicester City, where he won two Division 2 championships. Later in his career Anderson played for Peterborough United during their debut Football League season (1960\u201361) and for Nuneaton Borough. On retiring from playing football he set up a painting and decorating business in Leicester.\nHe won his only cap for Scotland in their final preparation match for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, against Finland. Although he was named in the finals squad as understudy to Fred Martin, Anderson did not travel to Switzerland as Scotland chose only to take 13 players. Anderson stayed at home on reserve, along with the likes of Bobby Combe and Jimmy Binning. Inside forward George Hamilton was also on reserve but travelled after Bobby Johnstone withdrew through injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["Banks faced competition from five other goalkeepers, including 30-year-old Scotland international Johnny Anderson and 25-year-old Dave MacLaren. He started the 1959\u201360 season as the reserve team's goalkeeper. This in effect made him the club's second choice, ahead of four of his rivals but behind first team choice MacLaren. He had played four reserve team games when MacLaren picked up an injury, and manager Matt Gillies selected Banks for his Leicester debut against Blackpool at Filbert Street on 9 September. The match finished 1\u20131, with Jackie Mudie's strike cancelling out Ken Leek's opener. Banks retained his place for the 2\u20130 loss to Newcastle United at St James' Park three days later. With McLaren fit again, Banks was sent back to the reserves but, after the first team conceded 14 goals in the next five games, he was recalled and became the first-choice goalkeeper for the remainder of the season. The defensive record did not improve at first, with Banks conceding six in a heavy defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, but he improved in each match and the Foxes settled for a comfortable 12th-place finish. In training, he worked extensively on improving his weaknesses, such as coming for crosses. He put in extra hours during training and came up with practice sessions to improve his skills \u2013 this was largely unique in an era where there were no specialized goalkeeping coaches. In the summer, both Anderson and MacLaren departed, leaving Banks as the club's undisputed number one ahead of a group of understudies."]}, {"page": "John Anderson", "response": ["*Johnny Anderson (politician), member of the Utah House of Representatives", "*Johnny Anderson (footballer) (1929\u20132001), Scottish footballer who most notably played for Leicester City"]}, {"page": "John Anderson (footballer born 1929)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Johnny Anderson (footballer)"]}]}}
