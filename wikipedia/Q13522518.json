In the English-speaking world, his genre is sometimes characterised as \"magic journalism\" (in counterpoint to magic realism), a term coined by Adam Hochschild in 1994.In an article in Slate Magazine, writer Jack Shafer called Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski a fabulist who did not adhere to the basic rules of journalism.\"The Lies of Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski\". Jack Shafer, Slate Magazine, 25 January 2007. As part of his criticism, Shafer cited the anthropology professor John Ryle. His condemnation was rebutted by Meghan O'Rourke in Slate five days later; O'Rourke contended that Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's invention of petty details to reveal a larger truth did not make him a bad journalist. O'Rourke, Meghan (30 January 2007). \"Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski: Defending his literary license\". Slate MagazineThe British journalist Michela Wrong  wrote in the New Statesman, \"Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski would have helped his own case if he had been more consistent, and modest, about what he offered. If you present your work as 'magical journalism', of the Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez genre, best not simultaneously lecture a younger generation of journalists, as he did, on their imprecision. And if your prime years in the field were largely confined to the Cold War, best not present yourself as an eternal sage on the subject.\" Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski often introduced himself with the line \"I am a poor reporter who unfortunately lacks the imagination of a writer\".", "A 2001 review by John Ryle concerned the Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski memoir entitled The Shadow of the Sun released in the same year.John Ryle (2001), \"At play in the bush of ghosts\" originally published as the \"Tales of Mythical Africa\" by the Times Literary Supplement, 27 July 2001. Review of: Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, The Shadow of the Sun, translated by Klara Glowczewska, 336 pp, Penguin Books, 2001. See:  Ryle alleged that questions about the reliability of Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's reportage began with The Emperor. Scrutinizing Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's translation of expressions of fealty by Ethiopian courtiers, Ryle said that \"native speakers of Amharic say that these honorifics correspond to no known expressions in their language.\" Ryle wrote that he visited Ethiopia in the 1990s when the action of The Shadow of the Sun was taking place. He said there were inaccuracies in the story, for example, that Mengistu's generals did not escape justice and that the 'academics' among them were few and far in between. Ryle noticed that the initials of Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's informants did not correspond to the names of witnesses in the trial of the Derg in Addis Ababa. He added that Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's description of the capital devoid of bookstores did not correspond to what he has seen on his last visit there, because he found six bookstores there. He also disputed Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's assertion that Haile Selassie did not read books by saying he had a library, was well read, and annotated documents."]}, {"page": "J. R.
