The conference debated nine resolutions about the future shape of the campaign, and elected officers and a steering committee.  Policies included a \"living minimum wage\", full trade union rights and the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Delegates argued that due to what they saw as previous false starts in trying to establish a party to represent working people\u2014such as Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party\u2014any new party would have to be democratic, open and inclusive, taking a federal approach, to bring in as many supportive organisations and groups as possible, with no one group or individual dominating.", "The second national conference of the campaign took place on 12 May 2007 at the University of London.
