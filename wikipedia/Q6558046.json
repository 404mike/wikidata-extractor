There, Flip briefly meets the Sixth Doctor. In this first appearance, the 2011 audio drama The Crimes of Thomas Brewster, Flip and Jared meet the Sixth Doctor, who returns them to Earth. Flip returns in the January 2012 release, The Curse of Davros where, journeying home on a night bus, she and Jared witness the crash of a Dalek Scout Ship. Investigating, they find the Sixth Doctor, whose mind has been swapped with that of Davros. During this encounter Jared's mind is swapped with that of a Dalek. After helping the Doctor to stop Davros from changing the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo, and the Doctor and Jared have their minds returned to their respective bodies, she joins the Doctor on his travels while Jared returns to 2012. After a series of travels in the TARDIS, she becomes separated from the Doctor in Earth orbit and almost becomes host to a piece of alien space debris named \"Scavenger\". After teleporting from its grasp she is trapped floating in space once more. Realising she is running out of Oxygen, she records a message for the Doctor and uses her spacesuit thrusters to propel herself toward Earth, to be either rescued or die in the attempt. She is later revealed to have married Jared, but she is abducted on her wedding day as part of a convoluted plan to trap the Doctor (Quicksilver), which results in her rejoining the Doctor alongside her 'successor', Constance Clarke.
