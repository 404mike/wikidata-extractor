In 2019, reanalysis of other previous studies has shown that structures that were taken in 1967 for bristles present on the surface of the species Spadella cephaloptera, and in 2003, for bacteria infecting Paraspadella gotoi, were in fact enveloped and spindle-shaped giant viruses with a cytoplasmic site of multiplication.Roxane-Marie Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my, Eric Faure, Taichiro Goto: Serendipitous Discovery in a Marine Invertebrate (Phylum Chaetognatha) of the Longest Giant Viruses Reported till Date. In: Biology, 2019, Abstract The viral species infecting P. gotoi, whose maximum length is 3.1 \u03bcm, has been named Klothovirus casanovai (Klotho being the Greek name for one of the three Fates whose attribute was a spindle, and casanovai, in tribute to Pr J.-P. Casanova who devoted a large part of his scientific life to the study of chaetognaths). The other species has been named Megaklothovirus horridgei (in tribute to Adrian Horridge, the first author of the 1967 article). On a photograph, one of the viruses M. horridgei, although truncated, is 3.9 \u03bcm long, corresponding to about twice the length of the bacteria Escherichia coli. Many ribosomes are present in virions but their origin remains unknown (cellular, viral or only partly viral). To date, giant viruses known to infect metazoans are exceptionally rare."]}, {"page": "University of St Andrews", "response": ["*Adrian Horridge"]}, {"page": "List of Old Edwardians (Sheffield)", "response": ["* Prof Adrian Horridge (born 1927)  \u2013 FRS, neurobiologist, professor at Australian National University"]}, {"page": "Gatty Marine Laboratory", "response": ["Until 1960 the Gatty was led by Dr James Munro Dodd.

The stempost makes a 70 degrees angle against the straight keel. The planks were bent by heating using low temperature fire. The bow and stern is pointed, almost similar to each other, but a flat platform was placed at the stern above 2 or 3 flat poles. This is where the helmsman stood, with a pole in hand, one foot pressing the rudder, holding the sail. The hull is long, thin, and almost rounded at the middle of the boat. There are ribs and seating at the edge of the boat, a deck with two levels. A Balinese janggolan observed by Adrian Horridge is 11 m long, 2.75 m wide, with midhull draft of 76\u00a0cm. The planking is 2.5\u00a0cm thick, the ribs are 7.5x12.5\u00a0cm in cross section, the mast is 4.3 m high. The height of stempost and sternpost is 1.2 m.Horridge. (1981). p. 120."]}]}}
