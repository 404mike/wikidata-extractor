Steve Ravenscroft, Rob Fidler, Jos Baxendell, Spencer Brown and Tom Beim each gained two caps on the tour \u2013 and have not played for England since.  Richard Pool-Jones, Scott Benton, Dominic Chapman and Stuart Potter only played once for England, on the Tour From Hell."]}, {"page": "Jon Callard", "response": ["Despite continuing to be selected for future England squads, including for their 1994 Summer Tour of South Africa, he fell behind, initially Paul Hull, and later Mike Catt, Tim Stimpson and Matt Perry as England's first choice Full Back. The intense competition for places in the England side over the next few years meant that Callard would only gain a total of five caps for England, although he did score an impressive total of 69 points in that time. He played in one solitary match in the 1995 Rugby World Cup against Western Samoa, scoring 21 points from the boot, in a 44\u201322 win that helped England progress to the Quarter Finals. Callard won his last cap for England in November 1995, in a 24\u201314 defeat to South Africa."]}]}}
