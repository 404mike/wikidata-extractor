Cumming recalled Peter Sallis had played a similarly detached character in the 1974 BBC drama The Pallisers, and she cast him in the role of Striker. Sallis was present during the rehearsals for the serial but when production was delayed he was unavailable for the new filming dates, being committed to filming Last of the Summer Wine, and was forced to drop out of the production, being replaced by Keith Barron.  Lynda Baron was cast as Captain Wrack, having previously participated in Doctor Who in the 1966 serial The Gunfighters as the voice that sings the \"Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon\" heard throughout that story. Tony Caunter, who had previously played Thatcher in The Crusade and Morgan in Colony in Space, was given the role of Jackson, with Christopher Brown and David Rhule being cast as Marriner and Wrack's sidekick Mansell respectively. Similarly to Sallis, David Rhule was unavailable for the revised filming dates in January, so singer Leee John replaced him at short notice, despite having no previous acting experience.", "Writing for the Radio Times, Mark Braxton was less enamoured of some of the performances, suggesting that Baron and Valentine Dyall turn in 'hammy' interpretations of their characters, while Leee John \"...makes heavy weather of the simplest activities: helming the ship seems to require the most bizarre posturing.\"  He had mixed views on the story as a whole, saying that \"Enlightenment has promising components that come together and briefly create a little magic, then vanish again, like ships that pass in the night.\" DVD Talk's John Sinnott had similarly mixed views on the serial, although conceding that \"...While it doesn't all succeed, they give it a good try and more things work than don't.\"  Sinnott also singled out the performance of Keith Barron for particular praise, along with the relationship between Marriner and Tegan."]}, {"page": "Juke Box Jury", "response": ["* 12 November 1989 \u2013 Leee John (replaced by a late Mica Paris half-way through), Matt Goss, Luke Goss, Tom WatkinsMatt Goss and Luke Goss of Bros appearing with their manager Tom Watkins"]}, {"page": "Elkie Brooks", "response": ["In March 2003, Brooks participated in the ITV music talent show Reborn in the USA, alongside musicians such as Peter Cox, Tony Hadley and Leee John.
