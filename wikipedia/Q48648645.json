He began his career at Norwich City's academy, where he spent two years as an academy scholar and was part of the FA Youth Cup-winning team during the 2012\u201313 season. He was released in May 2014 and joined Colchester United four months later, although injury meant he did not make any first-team appearances during his one season with the Essex club. Lokko gained his first experience of regular first-team football when he signed for National League club Welling United ahead of the 2015\u201316 season.\nHe spent one year at Welling before joining another National League club in the form of Maidstone United in June 2016. After one season at Maidstone, Lokko signed for Stevenage in August 2017. He was immediately loaned to Dagenham & Redbridge before returning to Stevenage in February 2018, then joining Dover Athletic on loan later that month. Lokko joined Dover on a permanent basis in June 2018. Lokko became captain at Dover before joining Harrogate Town in 2020. He signed for Aldershot Town of the National League in July 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2014\u201315 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|22||Kevin Lokko||CB||||Whitechapel||||0||0|| Norwich City||6 August 2014||Free transfer", "|Kevin Lokko"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 National League", "response": ["|Kevin Lokko"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2018 || CB ||  || Kevin Lokko || Dover Athletic || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 National League", "response": ["|Kevin Lokko"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Harrogate Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 14 August 2020 || DF || Kevin Lokko || Dover Athletic || Free transfer || ", "|DF||||26||Kevin Lokko||1||0||1||0||2", "|DF || || 26 ||Kevin Lokko|| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 ||0 "]}, {"page": "Lokko", "response": ["* Kevin Lokko (born 1995), English football player"]}, {"page": "2020 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|DF ||26|| Kevin Lokko "]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Harrogate Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 16 July 2021 || DF ||  || Kevin Lokko ||  Aldershot Town || Free transfer || "]}]}}
