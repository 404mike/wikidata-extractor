Jim Gamble, leader of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) in the UK, said in 2010 that his office had received 292 complaints about Facebook users in 2009 but that none of the complaints had come directly from Facebook. A spokesman for Facebook responded to complaints by meeting CEOP directly in person, and said that they take safety issues \"very seriously\". In 2003, MSN implemented chat room restrictions to help protect children from adults seeking sexual conversations with them. In 2005, Yahoo! chat rooms were investigated by the New York State attorney general's office for allowing users to create rooms whose names suggested they were being used for this purpose; that October, Yahoo! agreed to \"implement policies and procedures designed to ensure\" that such rooms would not be allowed. Computer programs have been developed to analyse chat rooms and other instant messaging logs for suspicious activity. As this can be prevented not only on platform level but also on the point of entry, it is recommended that parents establish safe environments for their children to use the Internet, with reduced risk of encountering cyber grooming individuals."]}, {"page": "Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command", "response": ["Previous heads of CEOP include Jim Gamble and Peter Davies."]}, {"page": "Highland Records", "response": ["*Jim Gamble"]}, {"page": "Disappearance of Madeleine McCann", "response": ["In the UK it was agreed that Madeleine's home force, Leicestershire police\u2014led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott\u2014would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry.; \"Profile: Matt Baggott\", BBC News, 11 August 2009. A strategic coordinating group, or \"gold\" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency. The PJ gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System); in Portugal, the information was collected in boxes. In addition the PJ had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates' decisions, which slowed things down. In an interview for Anthony Summers' and Robbyn Swan's book Looking for Madeleine (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a \"colonial power\".", "The McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case..
