Their musical style is rooted in the early to mid 1970s German electronic music era, often described as Berlin School, and transcends the genre using musical originality, multi-instrumentation, and complex harmonic arrangements using analogue sequencing. Their pieces are described as both exciting and haunting in equal measure, expressing strong central themes, and include contrasting atmospheres of rich sonic textures. Redshift music has been played on BBC TV and some listeners have likened certain pieces to film score, neo-industrial, as well as dark ambient. Listeners have commented on the hypnotic quality of the musical compositions.", "The band consists of Mark Shreeve, Julian Shreeve and James Goddard.
