The house served as a private asylum for the insane in the early nineteenth century. It was a stuccoed building, decorated with pilasters and wreathes, and it had a Tuscan porch. This columned south-facing porch was demolished in the early 1980s after becoming structurally unsafe. Soon after being acquired by the then university college a two-storey range of student accommodation, later known as the \"Old Wing,\" was constructed running south-westward from the original building. Constructed in brick and rendered brick, it had a pitched slate roof. Following this extension the hall could accommodate 60 students. In 1962\u201364 the architect Trevor Dannatt RA added a new range of accommodation plus a refectory and kitchens to the residence. Known as the \"New Wing,\" it was not physically connected to the earlier buildings; it was largely of brick construction with flat roofs, and the windows were sunk in vertical channels with concrete sills and lintels.Neave, p. 389. The original house was for most of its life stuccoed and painted white, however, it was hacked back to bare brick and stone in some places, or rendered in others, in the 1990s.

The post of Warden of Vaughan College was created to provide oversight of Vaughan College itself. P.A.W. Collins was the first holder of the post which was phased out 54 years later in an administrative re-organisation of 2008. In 1957 the University was granted its own charter. Also in the mid-1950s a major road scheme, which was to become \"Vaughan Way\" required the demolition of the Vaughan College building. The question of where to move to was in large measure answered by Alderman Charles Keene, a University Pro-Vice Chancellor who was also on the City Council's Town Planning and Museums committees. He suggested a new building close to the old Great Central Street site, which could incorporate both the college and a new museum, alongside the Roman archaeological site at Jewry Wall. Designed by Trevor Dannatt, work began in 1959 and was completed in 1962. The lower floor, housing the Jewry Wall Museum, with Roman mosaics and other artifacts from Roman Leicester along with Iron Age and post-Roman displays, is at the same level as the Roman bath-house foundations, well below street level. Vaughan College occupied the upper floor of the long L-shaped building of cream-coloured brick and concrete, with impressive views of the Jewry Wall Roman remains and St Nicholas Church. 100 years after its foundation, the college had a modern, purpose built building, and a staff team providing full-time, day release and part-time courses."]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| Trevor Dannatt   ||align=\"center\" |  1983  || Professor of Architecture 1988\u20131995"]}, {"page": "2016 New Year Honours", "response": ["* James Trevor Dannatt.
