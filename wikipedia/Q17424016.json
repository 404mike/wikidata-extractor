It was also utilized around the same time by Scottish physician George Martine (1700\u20131741). De Haen made particular strides in medicine with the thermometer. By observing the correlation in a patient's change in temperature and the physical symptoms of the illness, he concluded that a record of one's temperature could inform the doctor of a patient's health. However, his proposals were not met with enthusiasm by his peers and the medical thermometer remained a scarcely used instrument in medicine."]}, {"page": "Martine", "response": ["* George Martine (historian) (1635\u20131712), Scottish historian", "* George Martine (physician) (1700\u20131741), Scottish physician"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| George Martine||11/12/1740||1700 \u2013 ?
