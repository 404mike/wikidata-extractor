In the First World War, he served in the East Surrey Regiment and was awarded the Military Cross.He married Aliex Schaeffer in 1919, but she died in childbirth in 1923, and the baby was stillborn.  In 1933, he married Doris Garrod, and they had a son and a daughter.In 1921, he gained a first class Bachelor of Science in chemistry from the Royal College of Science in London, and went on to postgraduate studies in chemical engineering at Imperial College, London. During the Second World War, he was scientific director  of Special Operations Executive responsible for the development of technology for sabotage and espionage.  During this period he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.In 1945, he was appointed as professor of chemical engineering at Imperial College. By 1952, he was made the Head of Department, being responsible for the new building (completed 1967).  He was appointed pro-rector of the college in 1956 until his retirement in 1961.
