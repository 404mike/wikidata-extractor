At the Quaker yearly meeting in 1930 the Nobel prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore attacked colonial rule in India. The Quakers were disturbed by the address and John Graham was particularly outraged. Afterwards it was agreed that a representative would be sent to India to attempt a reconciliation between the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, and Gandhi. This task was assigned to Horace Alexander, who first met Gandhi in March 1928. He made it possible for Gandhi to attend the 1931 round-table conference in London. After the conference he founded the India Conciliation Group along with Agatha Harrison and Carl Heath. Becoming a close friend of Gandhi (who, in 1942, described Alexander as \"one of the best English friends India has\"), he wrote extensively about Gandhi's philosophy. In 1947 he attempted to intervene to control the violence between Muslims and Hindus and was beside Gandhi in Calcutta on 15 August 1947."]}, {"page": "Agatha (given name)", "response": ["*Agatha Harrison (1885\u20131954), English industrial welfare reformer"]}, {"page": "Charles Freer Andrews", "response": ["He and Agatha Harrison arranged for Gandhi's visit to the UK.Agatha Harrison, Open University, Retrieved 20 March 2017 He accompanied Gandhi to the second Round Table Conference in London, helping him to negotiate with the British government on matters of Indian autonomy and devolution."]}]}}
