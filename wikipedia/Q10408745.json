He went on to score his first goals for Chesterfield with a brace after coming on as a half-time substitute against Yeovil Town; he scored from a pass from Paul Hall after Yeovil goalkeeper Chris Weale was left stranded after being lobbed, and then scored his second after gaining the ball from Mark Allott, which helped his team to a 3\u20131 victory. An 89th-minute goal from Smith against Bradford City on 7 January 2006 saw his team earn a 1\u20130 victory. He agreed to a new two-year contract at Chesterfield in March and finished 2005\u201306 with 29 appearances and scoring three goals. His recurring knee injury was confirmed to be severe patella tendinitis, which resulted in him being unfit for the start of 2006\u201307. He made his return to action in a friendly against Staveley Miners Welfare in August and made his first league appearance of the season in a 4\u20130 defeat to Nottingham Forest on 2 September 2006 after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute. He scored the winner for Chesterfield in the Football League Trophy against Oldham Athletic with a diagonal shot from distance. Smith suffered from a knee injury in March 2007, which resulted in him undergoing surgery that ruled him out for the remainder of the 2006\u201307 season; in which he made 17 appearances and scored one goal, while Chesterfield were relegated to League Two. His severe tendinitis affected him in September, and eventually made his return in a 2\u20131 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup first round on 10 November. He was sent out on loan at League Two club Lincoln City for a month on 4 January 2008 and made his debut for the team a day later, helping set up the first goal in a 2\u20130 victory over Rochdale, after Jamie Forrester scored from goalkeeper Sam Russell's parry of a Smith effort. He made four appearances during his stay at Lincoln, all as a substitute, which was concluded after Lincoln decided against extending his loan at the club."]}, {"page": "Aaron Downes", "response": ["At the end of the 2006\u201307 season following his side's relegation to Football League Two not only did he sign an extension to his current contract at Chesterfield but he also was made team captain of Chesterfield following the departure of ex captain Mark Allott. Downes was at that time a valued member of the squad and as well as his defensive qualities he has an eye for goal, mainly from set pieces."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["Oldham dropped to second place in League One following the 2\u20132 draw to start September, and was again on the road as they faced Tranmere Rovers. The only goal came in the 35th minute, when Reuben Hazell headed in a goal after a cross from Neal Eardley. The game was played at a quick pace for most of the day as a total of 10 yellow cards were shown, but Oldham held out for a 1\u20130 win. On 13 September, Oldham was back at home to face 2007\u201308 League Two champions, Milton Keynes Dons. Lee Hughes didn't wait long to get the scoring started as he gave Oldham a 1\u20130 lead by scoring in the 8th minute. Despite seven shots on target, MK Dons could not get a goal past goalkeeper Mark Crossley before Mark Allott grabbed Oldham's second and final goal in the 95th minute. Oldham battled Hartlepool United on 20 September for their seventh league game of the season. Lee Hughes and Chris Taylor gave Oldham a solid 2\u20130 lead heading into the halftime break. Hartlepool battled back hard in the opening moments of the second half, scoring three times in first ten minutes of the second half with goals from Andy Monkhouse, Antony Sweeney, and Joel Porter. In the 58th minute, Taylor scored Oldham's third of the game as the two teams finished the game with a 3\u20133 draw. Again at home, Oldham faced off against 15th placed local rivals Huddersfield. Ian Craney scored his second in five games, giving the visitors an early 1\u20130 lead in the 29th minute. An Andy Liddell free kick early in the second half would be enough, as the game ended with a 1\u20131 draw.", "After struggling through October, Oldham started November at home against Yeovil Town who was coming off consecutive scoreless draws. It appeared it could have been three consecutive scoreless matches for Yeovil when the two teams were left without goals at halftime. Aaron Brown capitalised from a deep free kick, ending his side's goal drought to give the visitors a 1\u20130 lead. Ex-Oldham player Paul Warne grabbed another goal for the Glovers three minutes later from hesitant play by Neal Eardley. Oldham was unable to get a ball past goalkeeper Asmir Begovi\u0107, who secured a 2\u20130 victory for Yeovil and gave the Latics their first home loss since March 2008. After a 2\u20132 draw in the FA Cup, the Latics faced Northampton Town on 15 November. Oldham had several chances in the first half including a shot by Lee Hughes which was an apparent early goal, though he was flagged by the official for offsides. With a quarter of an hour left in the match, Hughes was cut down in the box to give Andy Liddell a chance to give the Latics a lead. Liddell easily converted on the spot-kick, sending Frank Fielding the wrong way. Despite the 1\u20130 victory, the game ended on a bad note as Hughes was sent off with his second yellow card. At Roots Hall, Southend United was just once beaten in their previous thirteen home games. James Walker tried to help him side continue the streak as he smashed the ball past Mark Crossley from point-blank range for a 1\u20130 Southend advantage. Chris Taylor pulled Oldham back on level terms with a 67th-minute header, before Hughes scored his seventh of the season to give Oldham a 2\u20131 victory. Three days later, Oldham faced off against Walsall at home. Mark Allott started the scoring early, grabbing an early 1\u20130 lead for Oldham from a deflected shot. Michael Ricketts, a former Oldham striker, struck back in 23rd minute with a goal before Alex Nicholls gave the visitors a 2\u20131 advantage. Shortly before the halftime whistle, Hughes scored his 8th goal of the season which put the two sides on level terms at the break. With the game looking like a sure draw, Hughes grabbed another goal in the 89th minute as Oldham moved up to 4th place to end November.", "| align=left|8 || align=left|MF || align=left| Mark Allott", "* Goal of the Season: Mark Allott v Huddersfield Town, 1\u20131, 3 January 2009"]}, {"page": "List of Oldham Athletic A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Div 2 || 46 || 14 || 9 || 23 || 48 || 66 || 51 || 20th || R3 || R1 || R1 || || || Mark Allott || 8", "| Div 2 || 46 || 16 || 12 || 18 || 50 || 55 || 60 || 14th || R3 || R1 || R2 || || || Mark Allott & Steve Whitehall || 11"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Football League Two", "response": ["| Mark Allott"]}, {"page": "Craig Clay", "response": ["He signed a two-year professional contract with Chesterfield in June 2010.

A week later, Stevenage drew 1\u20131 away at Chesterfield. Stevenage took the lead five minutes before the interval, Darius Charles heading in from close range after Michael Bostwick's looping header was guided towards goal. Bostwick was sent-off twenty minutes into the second-half, receiving a second bookable offence for a foul on Mark Allott. The home side equalised late on when Jack Lester headed in Dean Morgan's cross. Three days later, Stevenage earned their first win of the season, securing a 3\u20131 away victory against Bournemouth. Stevenage took the lead shortly before half-time, Craig Reid's quick turn and shot beating Shwan Jalal in the Bournemouth goal after Lawrie Wilson's threaded ball beat the offside trap. Two minutes after the interval, the home side were level, substitute Harry Arter scoring from Marc Pugh's squared pass. The away side took the lead once more with half an hour remaining, John Mousinho scoring from the penalty spot after Bournemouth captain Adam Barrett handled Stacy Long's shot on the line, receiving a red card in the process for denying a goalscoring opportunity. Stevenage doubled their advantage in injury-time when Chris Beardsley latched on to Scott Laird's pass and beat Jalal with a first time finish. Stevenage then drew 2\u20132 at home to Hartlepool United on 20 August, coming from two goals down to salvage a point. The visitors opened the scoring through Peter Hartley's headed goal from a corner ten minutes before the interval. Hartlepool doubled their lead just before half-time through an Adam Boyd penalty kick after Colin Nish was fouled in the area by Jon Ashton. With twenty minutes remaining, Byron Harrison scored his first goal of the season when he netted from six yards out. Scott Laird then restored parity with just two minutes remaining, heading in Robin Shroot's corner to ensure Stevenage earned a point. A week later, Stevenage lost their first league game of the season when they travelled to league leaders Milton Keynes Dons, losing 1\u20130 courtesy of a second-half goal from Charlie MacDonald."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["|= ||MF || ||7 ||Mark Allott || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|Mark Allott"]}, {"page": "2012 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|CM ||7 || Mark Allott"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 in English football", "response": ["* 3 April 2013: Mark Allott, 36, former Oldham Athletic and Chesterfield midfielder"]}, {"page": "Allott", "response": ["*Mark Allott (born 1977), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Allott, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Allott"]}]}}
