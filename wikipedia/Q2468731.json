Along with other exiled Flemings, he made a career in Tudor London, painting allegorical images as well as portraits of the gentry and nobility. About 40 paintings are now attributed to Eworth, among them portraits of Mary I and Elizabeth I.

The influence of Holbein's \"monumentality and attention to texture\" has been detected in Eworths' work.Brooke, 53. According to art historian Erna Auerbach: \"Holbein's influence on the style of English portraiture was undoubtedly immense. Thanks to his genius, a portrait type was created which both served the requirements of the sitter and raised portraiture in England to a European level.

The rich background and clear colors used in the draperies and furniture set off the somber mood and mourning gown of the sitter. Dressed as an icon of virtuous widowhood despite her ongoing marriage to Francis Thursby, Mary sits sober and erect in a chair of estate, posed in front of gathered green draperies and a busy tapestry featuring vines of roses, the flower of virtue and, parenthetically, the emblem of the Tudors.Of the 1559 portrait by Hans Eworth, with her son Gregory, Susan E. James writes:In order to commemorate Gregory's majority in 1559 and in anticipation of the return of his inheritance by the crown, Mary commissioned Has Eworth to paint another portrait. Like Lady Anne Clifford's Great Picture, this work is a memorial to one woman's legal success in the securing of the family estates.
