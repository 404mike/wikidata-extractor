Before joining Darlington, he was on the books of Leeds United and Hull City without playing in the League for either.\nWhite was born in Newburn, Northumberland, the son of John White, an engineering fitter and turner, and his wife Barbara. At the time of the 1911 UK Census, the family was living in nearby Walbottle and the seven-year-old White was the fifth of nine surviving children. He played football for Newburn and for Annfield Plain before joining Second Division club Leeds United in May 1927. He played for Leeds' reserves in the Central League, but not for the first team, and moved on to Second Division Hull City a year later. Again, he never played for their first team, and after winger Billy Eden left for Sunderland in October 1929, Darlington signed White in his position. He scored twice from nine Third Division North matches, and was not retained at the end of the season.White's older brother Bob also played in the Football League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sam White", "response": ["* Sam White (baseball) (1893\u20131929), baseball player", "* Sam White (film producer) (1906\u20132006), American film producer", "* Sam White (footballer) (1903/4 \u2013 after 1929), English footballer", "* Sam White (foreign correspondent) (1913\u20131988), British journalist"]}]}}
