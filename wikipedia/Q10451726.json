Low attendances forced him to sell Clint Boulton to Torquay United for \u00a310,000.

During his thirteen years at the helm, Heath were one of the most feared sides in Cheshire football, winning a string of honours including the Mid Cheshire League Championship in 1959\u201360, the League Cup in 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355, 1955\u201356 and made several appearances in the Cheshire Amateur Cup Final.
