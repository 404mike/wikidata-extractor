Over a dozen first team players from the previous season departed with 19 new players joining. The players that departed included longtime club captain Luke Chambers, first team regulars such as Andre Dozzell, Gwion Edwards, Alan Judge, Emyr Huws and Stephen Ward, and 2020/21 player of the season James Wilson.https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/ipswich-town/ipswich-town-announce-retained-list-7962900 Despite these changes and many tipping the club for promotion, Ipswich made a poor start to the season, taking only two wins in their opening 10 matches. On 4 December 2021, with the team sat in 11th and 7 points adrift of the playoffs, Cook was sacked by the club. Having been in charge for just over 9 months, Cook is the second shortest serving manager in the club's history. Cook argued that he deserved more time in an interview a month after his dismissal, stating \"If the new ownership had sat down and said to me at the start that if we didn\u2019t have instant success then [I would] be gone, then I wouldn\u2019t have stayed.
