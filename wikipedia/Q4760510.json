He spent six seasons in the American Soccer League, ten in the Major Indoor Soccer League, four in the National Professional Soccer League and two in the Continental Indoor Soccer League.\nChapman was born in London, England, on 18 September 1959. An Arsenal signee at age 16, he turned pro the following year. Chapman went to the United States in the summer of 1978 to play outdoors for the California Sunshine of the American Soccer League for two seasons. In 1980, he moved to the Cleveland Cobras, spending two seasons with them. In 1982, he moved to the Detroit Express. The Express won the Championship in 1982 as Chapman led the league with 23 goals. His last outdoor season came in 1983 with the Express. The league collapsed at the end of the season and Chapman dedicated himself to indoor soccer. He had already established himself as an indoor player, signing in 1979 with the Wichita Wings of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). In 1984, he was a first team All Star as a forward. He began the 1984\u20131985 season in Wichita, but on 1 March 1985, the Cleveland Force purchased Chapman's contract. He finished the season in Cleveland, then played the 1985\u20131986 season with the Force before being released on 10 May 1986 as part a salary reduction effort. He then moved to the Baltimore Blast before moving to the Wings for the 1986-1988 seasons. Chapman, known as one of the best natural goal-scorers to ever play the indoor game, was a fan favourite in every city. He finished with 307 MISL goals, a tally which ranks 8th all time. His best season was 1983\u201384 when he finished second in goal scoring, seventh in league overall scoring and was named to the league's All-MISL team.\nIn 1990, Chapman became a player-coach of the National Professional Soccer League's Detroit Rockers. He led the league in scoring during the 1990\u20131991 season with 77 goals and 37 assists in 40 games. He was selected as both the NPSL MVP and a first team All Star that season. In 1992, the Rockers won the NPSL championship. In 1994, the Detroit Neon of the Continental Indoor Soccer League hired Chapman away from the Rockers. In 2000, he came out of retirement to play for the Detroit Rockers in their last three games of the season, making him one of only two players (Goalkeeper, Victor Nogueira) to play in four different decades.\nInvolved in youth coaching since 1978, Chapman started the Birmingham United Football Club in 1997, a youth soccer club in Birmingham, Michigan. The club currently has 50 teams, both boys and girls, from U-9 to U18. There is also a Kickstart program for children from 6\u20138 years old and a little league rec program that has 500 boys and girls from ages 3\u20139.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Major Indoor Soccer League (1978\u20131992)", "response": ["# 307 \u2013  Andy Chapman (Wichita Wings, Cleveland Force, Baltimore Blast)", "* Andy Chapman"]}, {"page": "Detroit Safari", "response": ["The Detroit Safari (founded as the Detroit Neon) was a member of the Continental Indoor Soccer League that played at The Palace of Auburn Hills.

Tom Marshall became the Wings\u2019 general manager. On November 23, 1979, with only a week to go before the opening game, Marshall ceased to be a part of the Wings organization. The Wings and Marshall disagreed on the details of the separation, but it was to be permanent. Ward Lawrence took over as general manager and Becker brought in Ray Denton to help run day-to-day operations. Mike Ivanow was to be the first signing, but the paperwork sent to his home misspelled his name. The delay resulted in Norman Piper becoming the first Wichita Wing. Piper was joined by the former Dallas Tornado and Liverpool player Kevin Kewley, who became the team's captain. Former Manchester United forward Jimmy Ryan and Argentinian phenom Omar Gomez anchored the team's offense. Roy Turner brought on George Ley as a player-coach. Later in the season, the team added former Manchester United winger Willie Anderson and forward Andy Chapman. Chapman had signed with Arsenal at age 16 and would become a fan favorite in Wichita, becoming the fifth leading scorer in Wings history. Ivanow would be joined in goal by Keith Van Eron. Though Ivanow had US Olympic experience, Van Eron would end up playing more time in goal.", "Omar Gomez returned to the Wings for the 1982-83 season, after spending time playing for the New York Arrows. He would end the year second on the team in both goals and assists. Kim's older brother, Per Rontved, the former Danish national team captain, joined the Wings as well. Andy Chapman led the team in scoring with 48 goals. At 27-21 by season's end, the Wings finished second in their division, just ahead of the Steamers. They would face St. Louis again in the playoffs, this time in the quarterfinals. The Wings would finally break the curse. In game three, at the Kansas Coliseum, the Wings would triumph in a game with a variety of unusual events: Kim R\u00f8ntved scored on an almost unbelievable header from beyond 100 feet; Per Rontved made a 125-foot shorthanded shot; and Steamer defender Steve Pecher scuffled with a Wings fan while in the penalty box, resulting in his ejection from the game.", "St. Louis would get revenge at the end of the 1983-84 season, sweeping the Wings in the semifinals. That year's squad featured a new arrival from Scotland: Ian Anderson. He would lead the team in blocks. Andy Chapman finished second in scoring in the MISL, with 53 goals. Kim R\u00f8ntved was named the league's Defender of the Year. The team's finances were bolstered by excellent attendance at 9,391 per game. The 1984-85 season was a disappointing one for the team. The Wings would end with a losing record of 21-26 and lose in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. However, they added two players that would have a long-term impact. Terry Rowe was a talented defender from London, England. Danish sensation Erik Rasmussen earned his nickname, \"The Wizard,\" due to his dynamic abilities on the ball. He would become a record-setting player during his career with the Wings. In 1988, he earned the team's only MISL MVP award.", "| Andy Chapman", "| Andy Chapman", "|Andy Chapman"]}, {"page": "List of American and Canadian soccer champions", "response": ["| Andy Chapman", "| Andy Chapman"]}, {"page": "Detroit Express (1981\u20131983)", "response": ["The 1982 ASL consisted of 7 teams in one division.
