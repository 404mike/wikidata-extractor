In 1848, Elizabeth Rigby (later Elizabeth Eastlake), reviewing Jane Eyre in The Quarterly Review, found it \"pre-eminently an anti-Christian composition,\" declaring: \"We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad, and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has also written Jane Eyre.\""]}, {"page": "Emma Thompson", "response": ["The period drama Effie Gray, a project that she had been working on for many years, based on the true-life story of John Ruskin's disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. The American playwright Gregory Murphy said that Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which he claimed he had submitted to Thompson through a mutual friend in 2003 to consider the role of Elizabeth Eastlake in a proposed film of his play, and to Thompson's husband Greg Wise through a casting director to consider the role of John Ruskin in the play's 2005 West End production. In 2008, Thompson announced that she and Wise \"had written a script together about John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic, which we want to make into a film.\" After meeting with Thompson and her producers, Potboiler Productions, Murphy was offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson in settlement of his claim. This settlement offer was later abandoned by Thompson, Greg Wise and their partner Donald Rosenfeld, when their company Sovereign Films took over production of the film and instigated the suit, creating the independent entity Effie Film, LLC, spearheaded by Rosenfeld, to litigate it.  In March 2013, District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed \"some of the most troubling material\" had been removed, ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were \"quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events\". In response to Murphy's attorney's concerns that the completed film Effie Gray would not adhere to Thompson's second revised screenplay, Judge Griesa concluded his ruling by saying that Thompson's film would not infringe Murphy's play or screenplay \"only to the extent that it does not substantially deviate from the November 29, 2011 screenplay,\" the date of Thompson's second revised screenplay. In May 2013, Effie Gray's Cannes Film Festival premiere was cancelled. In October 2013, the film was withdrawn from the Mill Valley Film Festival in California due to \"unforeseen circumstances\" according to producer Rosenfeld. In December 2013, Thompson said of the still unreleased Effie Gray that its \"time has probably passed,\" comparing it to another project of hers that \"didn't happen either\". Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception. Thompson plays Elizabeth Eastlake and Greg Wise plays John Ruskin. They both declined to promote the film. Camilla Long, reviewing Effie Gray in The Sunday Times, wrote \"nothing fits together\" and \"no one seems to know why they made this film. Where is Thompson's passion and commitment, or any hint of what she intended to achieve.\" Manohla Dargis in her review in The New York Times called Effie Gray \"The cinematic equivalent of a Brazilian wax, the movie omits much of the story's most interesting material to create something that's been smoothly denatured.\""]}, {"page": "Anna Brownell Jameson", "response": ["Anna Brownell Jameson (17 May 179417 March 1860) was the first Anglo-Irish art historian.
