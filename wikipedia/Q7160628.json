During a fifteen-year career with that company, beginning at age 19, she was particularly known for her interpretations of the title role in Iolanthe, Pitti-Sing in The Mikado, Phoebe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Mad Margaret in Ruddigore.  She later performed on television, in films and in musicals in London's West End.  Jones's best-known recordings include the role of Pitti-Sing on both the 1973 D'Oyly Carte Mikado and the company's 1966 film version of The Mikado.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Edith||Joan Gillingham||Joyce Wright||Peggy Ann Jones||Patricia Leonard||Jill Pert"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Pitti-Sing||Joyce Wright||Peggy Ann Jones||Judi Merri||Lorraine Daniels", "In 1966, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a film version of The Mikado that closely reflected their traditional staging, although there are some minor cuts.
