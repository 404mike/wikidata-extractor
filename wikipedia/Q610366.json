His relationship with Advocaat eventually broke down, and after a training ground bust-up with teammate Fernando Ricksen, followed by him then refusing to play in a match for the Rangers under-21 team, he emerged as a target for Bradford City and Manchester City in January 2001. He chose to return to Manchester, and made his debut on 31 January, coming on as a half-time substitute for Andy Morrison in a 1\u20131 draw with Liverpool in the league. He played 11 games for City, scoring once in a 4\u20132 defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup.

Dunne had various partners in the centre of defence in his first season at the club and for a few games he played in a three-man defence with Andy Morrison and Steve Howey. His first season saw City relegated into the First Division and acquire the services of a new manager, Kevin Keegan. Manchester City made an instant return to the Premier League, finishing the 2001\u201302 season as First Division champions. Disciplinary problems in 2003 resulted in a club suspension, and his time at Manchester City looked to be over.

He signed defender Darren Bradshaw, midfielder Micky Mellon and spent a club record \u00a3245,000 on Andy Morrison, who Allardyce described as a \"horrible in-your-face\" centre-back and a \"complete nutter\". He also changed the club's backroom staff, hiring Bobby Saxton as his assistant, promoting player Phil Brown to a coaching role, and appointing Mark Taylor as physio, who would follow Allardyce to Blackburn and Newcastle.

After a short time he was bought by English team Manchester City, where he teamed up with fellow Georgians Murtaz Shelia (a former teammate) and Georgi Kinkladze. Tskhadadze's time at the Manchester club was fraught with injury forcing the team to buy other central defenders such as Andy Morrison. In March 2000 he was released from the club.

Edghill was capped by England at under-21 and 'B' level, but his development was hampered by a series of serious injuries, including missing the entire 1996\u201397 season due to a knee injury. After recovery from this injury Edghill featured regularly in the first team for the next three seasons and also scored in the penalty shootout of the play-off final despite, at this point, never having scored in his professional career. In the 1999\u20132000 season an injury to team captain Andy Morrison saw Edghill take over as captain and he helped earn City promotion back into the Premiership. The 1999\u20132000 season also saw Richard score his first professional goal in a 2\u20130 win against Blackburn Rovers. By then City's longest serving player, Edghill suffered a poor start to the 2000\u201301 season including a calamitous own goal in a 2\u20131 defeat against Coventry City where he was substituted at half-time. His team-mate Nicky Weaver criticized the crowd's treatment of Edghill, who had been withdrawn by manager Joe Royle to spare him further embarrassment. Edghill lost his first team place and the captaincy, and he was loaned to Birmingham City for a month.", "Royle purchased both Richard Dunne and Laurent Charvet to replace Edghill. However Manchester City were going through a bad run of form and on 1 January 2001 Edghill returned to the starting line up along with Andy Morrison. However Royle was unsure of his best team hence the choice of personnel was often erratic. After falling out of the first team picture again he was transfer-listed on 8 February 2001. Manchester City were relegated and Kevin Keegan became manager. Keegan used a 3\u20135\u20132 formation with wing backs and Shaun Wright-Phillips was preferred at Right wing back to Richard Edghill.

Prior moved to Derby in 1998 but did not settle there, though did manage to score the winner in a game against Sheffield Wednesday. A number of clubs showed an interest in him before Manchester City signed him shortly before the transfer deadline in the 1999\u201300 season. City had signed him to replace the injured Andy Morrison as they had only been able to field two central defenders (Gerard Wiekens and Richard Jobson) for most of the season. His impact on the team was immediate, his goals earning City numerous victories and ultimately promotion. As City arrived in the Premiership Prior found his first team opportunities limited as the then City manager, Joe Royle, bought Steve Howey, Richard Dunne and Paul Ritchie, while Andy Morrison also returned from his lengthy injury."]}, {"page": "Jonny Allan", "response": ["Allan was Northwich's top goal scorer as they won the Conference North division in 2006.
