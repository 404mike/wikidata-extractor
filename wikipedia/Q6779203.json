Chapman agreed to be guest of honour at the ceremony held at the Divinity School at the University of Oxford. Pictures of her in attendance, which were posted on the university's website, have now been removed. The ceremony was also attended by an undercover reporter and actor from the BBC. The CMI \"severed all links\" to the IIU and that the University of Oxford banned the IIU from using its premises again. A Malaysian, described by the Sunday Star as a \"prominent public figure\" and \"leading academic\", who had received an honorary degree from Irish International University in 2001 was surprised to be told (in 2009) that the university was considered to be a scam. He told a newspaper reporter that he had attended a graduation ceremony at the University of London and that the school seemed \"very credible\".\"Duped by rogue college\", The Sunday Star (Malaysia), 23 August 2009.
