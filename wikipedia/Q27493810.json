This was followed by nine months studying coral reefs in the Red Sea, prior to accepting a place as a biologist on the British Graham Land Expedition of 1934\u201337.\nOn that expedition he initially carried out the task of marine biologist on the expedition ship Penola but then exchanged roles with the shore biologist. As a result, he was able to take part in the long exploratory expedition of 600 miles by dog sledge which discovered the ice-filled George VI Sound, separating Alexander Island from the Antarctic Peninsula. They also confirmed that the peninsula was not an archipelago.\nIn 1939, he married fellow zoologist, Kate Ricardo, a specialist of East African and Palestinian fisheries (and daughter of consulting engineer Sir Harry Ricardo, FRS). Together, they carried out extensive fieldwork in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Belize and the Guianas, and published almost two dozen articles and books on sirenians between 1962 and 1977. They had four sons.\n\nDuring the Second World War Bertram was initially based at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, where he worked on the development and testing of Arctic clothing and equipment for the War Office. He was involved in the invention of the string vest, which allows a thin layer of warm air to circulate next to the skin and reduces the loss of body heat. In 1940 he was posted to Palestine for three years as Chief Fisheries Officer, helping to maximise the food resources in the Gulf of Aqaba.\nAfter the war he took up a fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge and from 1949 concurrently held the part-time post of Director of the Scott Polar Research Institute.\nHe was a strong advocate for the need to stabilise world population and was a long-term member (and for seven years general secretary) of the Galton Institute. After the passage of the British Nationality Act of 1948, Bertram authored several articles which argued that races were biologically distinct due to their evolved adaptations to different environments, and that miscegenation should only be permitted between similar races.He died in 2001, aged 89.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scott Polar Research Institute", "response": ["* 1949\u20131956: Colin Bertram"]}, {"page": "Kate Bertram", "response": ["Cicely Kate Bertram, JP (n\u00e9e Ricardo; 8 July 1912 \u2013 6 July 1999) was a British academic specialising in East African and Palestinian fisheries, and working with her husband Colin Bertram on sirenea.
