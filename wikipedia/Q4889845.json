Although Peers used red brick in the title of the original book, he used redbrick adjectivally in the text and in the title of the 1945 sequel. He is said to have later regretted his use of red brick in the title. The term red brick for this category of universities is used as a contrast to the older more established universities that were all masonry constructions. The use of bricks was seen as a cheaper and less traditional alternative and therefore not as highly regarded, reflected in the general view of these new universities compared to the established ones."]}, {"page": "Peers", "response": ["* Edgar Allison Peers, English academician"]}, {"page": "Victoria Building, University of Liverpool", "response": ["The Victoria Building of the University of Liverpool, is on the corner of Brownlow Hill and Ashton Street, Liverpool, Merseyside, England ().

He achieved national fame for a large number of mostly institutional, commercial and educational buildings throughout England, his best-known buildings being Manchester Town Hall and the Natural History Museum, London. He also designed several structures for his home city.Cunningham & Waterhouse (1992), p84 Including the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, completed in (1889\u201392). Waterhouse's use of striking red brick and Burmantofts terracotta as building materials for its exterior and tiles inside inspired Edgar Allison Peers, a Spanish professor at Liverpool, to coin the term \"Red Brick University\" and to then apply it collectively to six recently founded institutions of higher education in some of the major industrial cities of England. Waterhouse designed other buildings for the university including the Chemical Laboratories (1884\u201387); the Walker Engineering Block (1887\u201391), the Gossage Chemical Laboratories (1895\u201397), the Medical School (1895\u201397), the Thompson Yates Laboratories (1895\u201398) and one final work for the university was a joint work with his son Paul Waterhouse for the Medical School, the Whelan Building (1899\u20131904) that housed the Anatomy Department. Other important Waterhouse complexes are the Liverpool Royal Infirmary (1886\u201392) and Newsham Park Hospital (1870\u201375) built as The Liverpool Seamen's Orphan Institution. Waterhouse also designed the Great North Western Hotel (1871) in French renaissance style, that served Liverpool Lime Street railway station. He also designed Prudential Assurance Building, Liverpool (1885\u201386), he designed several office buildings for The Prudential Assurance company throughout Britain in the same style. He also designed the Pearl Assurance building, now known as St John's House. A smaller commission was the Turner Home, Liverpool. Waterhouse also designed three large Gothic houses in the city: the first is New Heys (1861\u201365) for lawyer W.G. Bateson, Allerton Road; then Allerton Priory (1866\u201375) and its entrance Lodge for colliery owner John Grant Morris and Mossley Hill House (1869\u201372), Park Avenue, for general broker Lloyd Rayner, it is now part of Mossley Hill Hospital."]}, {"page": "Hispanism", "response": ["Sir Walter Scott was an enthusiastic reader of Cervantes and tried his hand at translation. He dedicated his narrative poem The Vision of Roderick (1811) to Spain and its history. Thomas Rodd translated some Spanish folk ballads. Lord Byron also was greatly interested in Spain and was a reader of Don Quixote. He translated the ballad Ay de mi Alhama in part of his Childe Harold and Don Juan. Richard Trench translated Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca and was friends with some of the emigrated Spaniards, some of whom wrote in both English and Spanish, such as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Blanco White and Telesforo de Trueba y Coss\u00edo, and many of whom (including Juan Calder\u00f3n, who held a chair of Spanish at King's College), spread knowledge of the Spanish language and its literature. John Hookham Frere was a friend of the Duke of Rivas when the latter was in Malta, and Hookham translated some medieval and classical poetry into English. The brothers Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen and Benjamin B. Wiffen were both scholars of Spanish culture. The \"Lake Poet\" Robert Southey, translated Amad\u00eds de Gaula and Palmer\u00edn de Inglaterra into English, among others works. English novelists were strongly influenced by Cervantes. Especially so was Charles Dickens, who created a quixotic pair in Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller of Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. John Ormsby translated the Cantar de Mio Cid and Don Quixote. Percy Bysshe Shelley left traces of his devotion to Calder\u00f3n de la Barca in his work. The polyglot John Bowring traveled to Spain in 1819 and published the observations of his trip. Other accounts of travel in Spain include those of Richard Ford, whose Handbook for Travellers in Spain (1845) was republished in many editions, and George Borrow, author of the travelogue The Bible in Spain, which was translated into Castilian by Manuel Aza\u00f1a, the poet and translator Edward Fitzgerald, and the literary historian James Fitzmaurice-Kelly, who was mentor to a whole British generation of Spanish scholars such as Edgar Allison Peers and Alexander A.
