He deployed historical and statistical methods to analyse some of the key economic and social questions in Victorian England.  As an advocate of free trade and social justice he distinguished himself from some others within the English Historical School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peasants' Revolt", "response": ["Interpretations of the revolt have changed over the years. 17th-century historians, such as John Smyth, established the idea that the revolt had marked the end of unfree labour and serfdom in England. 19th-century historians such as William Stubbs and Thorold Rogers reinforced this conclusion, Stubbs describing it as \"one of the most portentous events in the whole of our history\". In the 20th century, this interpretation was increasingly challenged by historians such as May McKisack, Michael Postan and Richard Dobson, who revised the impact of the revolt on further political and economic events in England. Mid-20th century Marxist historians were both interested in, and generally sympathetic to, the rebel cause, a trend culminating in Hilton's 1973 account of the uprising, set against the wider context of peasant revolts across Europe during the period.; ; ;  The Peasants' Revolt has received more academic attention than any other medieval revolt, and this research has been interdisciplinary, involving historians, literary scholars and international collaboration."]}, {"page": "King's College London", "response": ["The proposal to establish a fellowship of King's was first considered in 1847.

A wide variety of people were elected as fellows of King's, including former principal Alfred Barry, former King\u2019s student then professor Thorold Rogers, architect William Burges and ornithologist Robert Swinhoe.
