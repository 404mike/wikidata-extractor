He gained a BSc in Physics from the University of Reading and a PhD in Image Processing in the department of Electronic Systems Engineering at the University of Essex. While Arts Computing Lecturer at Birkbeck College London (1987\u201396) he pioneered the digital imaging of paintings together with The National Gallery, London in the European project VASARI (1980s). This led to development of art imaging projects to print accurate art books (MARC project), view high detail images on the web (Viseum project) and find art images online (Artiste, SCULPTEUR and eCHASE). He has published this research in books on image processing and computer architecture as well as Transactions of the IEEE on content-based image retrieval He was an advisor on the imaging and image processing required for the Archimedes Palimpsest. Recent research led to a new imaging system for ancient seals together with Oxford University - which is helping to capture and read historic texts.He is one of the founders of the Electronics and the Visual Arts: EVA Conferences. He helped to found the Earth and Space Science Informatics focus group of the American Geophysical Union, is on the executive committee and has run ten annual sessions on applying sensor networks to earth science. In 2017 he received the AGU's Leptoukh award  for contributions to this area.\nHe is the co-founder of the VIPS (software) image processing package together with John Cupitt (National Gallery London and now Imperial College London). This is used widely and available as a standard package in Linux distributions as well as for Microsoft Windows/OS X. It is known for mosaicing, colour and parallel processing/performance. It has become the fastest way to generate thumbnails and resize images on web servers so is in use in Wikipedia itself  and sites such as Booking.com.\nHis current research is on Environmental Sensor Networks \nwhich are wireless sensor networks for studying/monitoring the environment, particularly in relation to glaciers\n \nand climate change (Glacsweb project). This research featured on BBC technology news and the BBC's News, it was the first wireless sensor network designed to be used in/under glaciers. His work to test the technology for landslide detection was also on BBC news. In 2014 he deployed what was probably the first low power, sub-GHz, 6LoWPAN fully-IP based Internet of Things environmental sensor network in the Cairngorms.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "EVA Conferences", "response": ["Started in London (United Kingdom), there are now EVA conferences in Berlin (Germany), Florence (Italy), Jerusalem (Israel), Paris (France), St Petersburg (formerly in Moscow, Russia), Australasia (first time in Canberra, Australia, in 2016) and other major cities.

Kirk Martinez of Birkbeck College and David Saunders of the National Gallery London were responsible for building the London scanner. Kirk hired Nicos Dessipris, who had been a fellow research student in the Image Processing group of the University of Essex, and David hired John Cupitt, who had just finished a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Kent.", "In 1997 Kirk Martinez moved to the University of Southampton so development and use continued in more projects (including Viseum,http://cordis.europa.eu/infowin/acts/analysys/products/thematic/atm/ch4/viseum.html ACOHIR and Artiste) and VIPS and ip developed in response to their needs. The software was moved from Sun to Linux in the late 90s and ip moved from Motif to GTK+, becoming nip. VIPS gained support for files larger than 2GB, and for up to 64 CPUs. nip was rewritten again for GTK+-2.0 and became the nip2 we know today."]}]}}
