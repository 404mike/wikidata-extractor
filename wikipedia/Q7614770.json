Meades made his senior Football League debut for AFC Wimbledon on 6 November in a 2\u20130 loss to Exeter City. With Meades having established himself as a regular in the starting XI, it was announced on 8 January 2013 that Ardley had extended Meades' loan spell with AFC Wimbledon by a further month. On 31 January 2013, it was announced that AFC Wimbledon had once again extended Meades' loan from Bournemouth until the end of the 2012\u201313 season. On 20 April 2013, Meades scored his first Football League goal in a 2\u20132 draw with 2012\u201313 Football League Two Champions Gillingham. Meades capped the end of a successful loan spell on 27 April 2013, the final day of the 2012\u201313 Football League Two season, by helping AFC Wimbledon to avoid relegation from the Football League after a 2\u20131 victory over Fleetwood Town. The 21-year-old was subsequently awarded the Natalie Callow Memorial Trophy for AFC Wimbledon's Young Player of the Year, as voted for by the fans."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|16 May 2014||MF|| Steven Gregory||Released||Free||"]}]}}
