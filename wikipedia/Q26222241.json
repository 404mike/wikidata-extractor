He was born at Chislehurst in Kent in 1828.Goodhew was a right-handed batsman and an infrequent right-arm bowler who bowled in the round arm style. At his death, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote of him: \"Without ever being in the front rank of professional cricketers, Goodhew was a very fair bat and rendered useful service to Kent at a time when the fortunes of the county were at rather a low ebb.\" His best innings was a score of 70 out of a total of just 132 when opening the Kent batting against Sussex in 1862. As a bowler, his best return came when playing for a \"Gentlemen of Kent\" side \u2013 though a professional \u2013 against a Gentlemen of England team in 1858, when he took seven first-innings wickets for 40 runs. In addition to 69 first-class matches for Kent, he played for county combinations involving Kent with Sussex, Surrey and Nottinghamshire and for the South in the North v South matches.After his playing career was over, Goodhew was used by Kent as an umpire in first-class matches from 1876 to 1882. He died in 1897 at Canterbury aged 68.", "link_mentions": {}}}
