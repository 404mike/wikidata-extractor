The following season he joined Collingwood where he would spend six seasons as a rover and small forward.\nKnown for his strength and courage, Norman appeared as a half forward flanker in the 1964 VFL Grand Final but ended up on the losing team. He kicked a career high 40 goals that year, bettering his 36-goal effort in 1962. Neither were enough to top Collingwood's goal-kicking but he earned that accolade in 1965 when he booted 32 goals. Norman also twice kicked six goals in a game during his career, both times against North Melbourne.He finished his career back in the Ballarat Football League, with Beaufort.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ballarat Football League", "response": ["|1968 || David Norman || Beaufort", "|1960 || David Norman || North Ballarat"]}, {"page": "David Norman", "response": ["David Norman may refer to:", "*David Norman (Australian footballer) (born 1942), former Australian rules footballer", "*David Norman (ornithologist) (born 1950), British physicist and ornithologist", "*David Norman (soccer) (born 1962), Canadian soccer player", "*David Norman Jr. (born 1998), Canadian soccer player, son of David Norman born 1962", "*David Norman (cricketer) (born 1968), former English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Collingwood Football Club players", "response": ["| 1961||David Norman||91||148||1961\u20131966"]}, {"page": "List of Collingwood Football Club leading goalkickers", "response": ["| 1965 || David Norman || 32"]}]}}
