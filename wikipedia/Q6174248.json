Canvey also won all eleven matches. During the 11 games, Boylan scored 21 times, which included consecutive hat-tricks against Bishop's Stortford and Billericay Town, and braces against Ford Utd, Maidenhead United, Northwood, and Hayes. He scored a hat-trick, his third of the season, in Canvey's 3\u20132 victory against Hornchurch on the final game of the 2003\u201304 season, as Canvey finally won promotion to the highest tier in non-league football after winning the Isthmian Premier title. He also scored in the FA Trophy final as Canvey lost 3\u20132 to Hednesford Town at Villa Park on 24 May 2004, scoring from a header just after half-time. Boylan scored 57 goals in 53 appearances in all competitions. On Boylan playing in the Conference National, Canvey manager Jeff King said \"I have no doubts about his ability to score goals in the Conference. It's a team effort which is why Lee was happy to sign a new contract here last year\".", "Boylan signed a one-year contract extension ahead of the 2005\u201306 season, and played in the club's opening game of the season, a 1\u20130 defeat to Accrington Stanley. He scored his first goals of the season in a 2\u20131 victory against Aldershot Town on 16 August 2005; both goals coming in the final four minutes of the match. He also scored twice in a 2\u20131 away win at Burton Albion, his second goal was a volley from 25 yards out. Boylan's two goals also condemned Burton to their first ever defeat at the Pirelli Stadium, as well as becoming the first player to score two goals at the stadium. He scored in Canvey's FA Trophy victory against Kingstonian, but was taken to hospital shortly after scoring having collided with the goal post and suffered facial injuries. The injury subsequently ruled him out for up to three months, and he returned to the first-team on 11 March 2006, coming on as a 60th-minute substitute and marking his comeback with a goal, scoring an injury-time winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory against Altrincham at Moss Lane. He scored in the final game of the season in Canvey's 2\u20130 away win against Halifax Town, latching onto a through pass and scoring from just outside the box, having already assisted Jason Hallett's early goal. The goal proved to be Boylan's last goal for the club, after Canvey announced that they would be resigning from the Conference National in May 2006, after manager Jeff King said he would withdraw his investment. Boylan ended the season having made 29 appearances, scoring 14 times. During his five years with the Essex club, Boylan made 210 appearances and scored 176 goals."]}, {"page": "Jeff Minton", "response": ["Minton joined Third Division side Leyton Orient in July 2001.
