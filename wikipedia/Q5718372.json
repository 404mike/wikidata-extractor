He was born on 9 December 1851 in Heeley, a small village two miles outside Sheffield. Henry's father had described himself as a stonemason in the 1851 census but as a farmer when the children were baptised. In the 1871 census, the 19-year-old Henry is living with his parents and shown as a joiner's apprentice.  The next year he married Hannah White (1855\u20131941) and moved to Napier Street, Sheffield, sandwiched between the Anglican Church and the Plymouth Brethren meeting hall. Having first worshiped at the Church, he moved to the Brethren and later formed his own Brethren meeting. Henry and Hannah had 13 children over a period of 20 years, ten of whom survived to adulthood.Henry worked as an employee in the building industry for around 20 years before establishing his own joinery shop in 1886. The censuses record his increased status: 1891 a joiner; 1901 a builder and joiner; and 1911 a joiner builder and contractor. His accommodation kept pace as well with successive moves to larger houses \u2013 by 1911 he was living in an eleven room house in Sheffield. As is described in Henry Boot PLC the firm became an increasingly important contractor but the driving force was Henry's eldest son, Charles Boot. By the start of World War I Henry had retired from the Company.  He died on 2 November 1931 at his home on Victoria Road in Broomhall aged 80, his grave is in Crookes Cemetery in Sheffield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Iver", "response": ["Pinewood was built on the estate of Heatherden Hall, a large, attractive Victorian house with spectacular grounds.  The Pinewood estate had previously been purchased by Lt. Col. Grant Morden, a Canadian financier and MP for Brentford and Chiswick.  He spent a fortune transforming the mansion into a showpiece home, adding refinements such as a huge ballroom, a Turkish bath and an indoor squash court.  Due to its seclusion, the house was used as a discreet meeting place for high-ranking politicians and diplomats.  Here the agreement for the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed.  When Grant Morden died in 1934 the estate was purchased at auction by Charles Boot, who had recently inherited a large construction firm from his father, Henry Boot, who died in 1931.  Within twelve months Charles had formed a partnership with J. Arthur Rank, who transformed the mansion into the office building for a film studio complex.  He based his new studios on the latest Hollywood designs of that era.  Charles Boot named the complex Pinewood Film Studios, a reference to the many pine trees in the area.

This is located to the north-east of the Beeches Estate on land that was part of Aldridge Urban District Council and now part of Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council.  Most of these houses were built in blocks of 4-6 with some blocks of 2 semi-detached in a similar style where space would not allow for larger blocks, or where the land was too steep for these blocks - notably in Holmesfield Road; that was built on a steep hill.

Due to a shortage of bricks, boot houses were built using precast reinforced clinker-concrete columns.
