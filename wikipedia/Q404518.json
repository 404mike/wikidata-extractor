In 1970, Chelsea again reached the FA Cup final and this time faced reigning league champions Leeds United. Over the two fiercely contested matches, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at Wembley Stadium and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2\u20132 draw. Shortly into the replay at Old Trafford, his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds' Mick Jones. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both Peter Lorimer and Terry Cooper, and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in extra time to help secure a 2\u20131 win. Such were Bonetti's performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the FWA Footballer of the Year awards."]}, {"page": "Worksop", "response": ["*Mick Jones, Sheffield United and Leeds United striker during the 1960s and 70s"]}, {"page": "Mick Jones", "response": ["Mick Jones may refer to:", "*Mick Jones (Foreigner guitarist) (born 1944), English guitarist, songwriter and record producer in the rock band Foreigner and earlier Spooky Tooth", "**Mick Jones (album), a 1989 album by Foreigner musician Mick Jones", "*Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist) (born 1955), British guitarist and a vocalist of The Clash", "*Mick Jones (footballer, born 1942), English footballer", "*Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945), of the Leeds United football team", "*Mick Jones (footballer, born 1947), English football player and football manager", "*Mick Jones (hammer thrower) (born 1963), British hammer thrower"]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["With his team coming close but failing to land a trophy he brought in a gypsy to lift a curse he believed had been placed on Elland Road so that there would be no bad luck for the 1967\u201368 season. A more practical measure he took to increase United's fortunes was to nearly double the club's record transfer to buy Sheffield United centre-forward Mick Jones for \u00a3100,000, who would replace the frequently injured Peacock as the main striker. Soon after the purchase Leeds recorded a 7\u20130 victory over Chelsea, though ironically Jones was not on the score-sheet. Revie's first trophy would be the League Cup, as they eliminated Luton Town, Bury, Sunderland, Stoke City and Derby County to reach the final against Arsenal; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of what was a dour and tense final as Revie told his players to \"shut up shop\" and defend their 1\u20130 lead. This success did not immediately translate into league and FA Cup success however, as they finished in fourth place and were beaten in the FA Cup semi-finals by Everton. They instead reached a second successive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final, beating CA Spora Luxembourg (Luxembourg), FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland), and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final against Hungarian club Ferencv\u00e1rosi.

This allowed him to sell O'Grady to Wolverhampton Wanderers for \u00a380,000 and move Lorimer to a more attacking role. He targeted the treble in 1969\u201370 and came close to achieving his aim only to fail on all three fronts in a congested close season, finishing second in the league to Everton, losing the 1970 FA Cup Final to Chelsea (after a replay), and exiting the European Cup with a semi-final defeat to Celtic in front of a competition record crowd of 136,505 at Hampden Park."]}, {"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["The 1969\u201370 season opened with victory in the 1969 FA Charity Shield, as Bremner captained Leeds to a 2\u20131 victory over Manchester City. With new arrival Allan Clarke played upfront alongside Mick Jones and Peter Lorimer Revie had to instruct Bremner and Giles to resist the temptation to get forward and attack. It took the team some time to gel, as only two wins came from the opening eight league games, and Leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions Everton. They chased Everton all season only to give up on the title after a home defeat by Southampton late in the campaign. In the European Cup Leeds recorded a club record 10\u20130 win over Norwegian side Lyn, with Bremner netting two of the goals. However they exited the competition at the semi-final stage after two defeats to Celtic; Bremner levelled the aggregate score by putting United 1\u20130 ahead in front of a competition record 136,505 spectators at Hampden Park, but Celtic came back to win the game and the tie with two second half goals. Further disappointment came in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Leeds were beaten 2\u20131 by Chelsea in extra-time of the replay at Old Trafford.

Leeds United chased a dream \"treble\" of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup though ultimately they won nothing.

Don Revie would select him for the 1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final played on 16 May against Milan, another 1\u20130 defeat.

At the age of 18 he faced Leeds United's FWA Footballer of the Year Bobby Collins in a reserve match, and despite Collins going as far as to punch him in the face Smith managed to last the entire match without backing down in an extremely physical contest. However, for a period Waddington banned Smith from playing against first-team players in training as he feared Smith would injure one of his players. He made his first-team debut in the Football League against Arsenal in September 1968, and was given the task of man-marking Bobby Gould. He gave away a penalty after fouling Jon Sammels, which Terry Neill converted for the only goal of the match, but otherwise made a solid debut. However, in his second appearance he gave away two penalties in a 3\u20131 defeat away to Ipswich Town, and had to wait five months for another first-team appearance. In March 1969, Alan Bloor picked up a knock and Smith returned to the starting line-up in a 5\u20131 defeat to Leeds, failing in his task to man mark Mick Jones, who claimed a hat-trick. Despite the poor start to his senior career, he managed to finish the 1968\u201369 season with 14 First Division appearances to his name, and was occasionally used as an emergency striker."]}, {"page": "Peter Lorimer", "response": ["Lorimer came to regular prominence in the 1965\u201366 season, making 34 League Championship appearances and scoring 19 goals, more than any other player at Leeds United managed that season.

He became renowned for these strikes, with his shots reaching speeds of up to 90\u00a0mph.
