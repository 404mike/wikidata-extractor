He was more of a squad player than a first-team regular in his time at Stamford Bridge, but was still highly enough regarded to be selected for an unofficial international for charity between England and Scotland (the teams were selected from players based in and around London) to commemorate the silver jubilee of King George V.He suffered a serious knee injury in 1936 which appeared to have ended his career and resulted in a compensatory payment from the Football League. However, by 1938 he was fit enough to sign for Ipswich Town, who used him in the reserves and FA Cup ties (as well as in coaching duties) but were declined permission by the league from using him in their matches due to his 'paid off' status, and the club decided not to dispute the matter further as they were newly elected members. In 1939 Hutcheson moved to non-league Crittall Athletic in Essex where the onset of World War II soon ended his career for good, however he settled in the local area.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Hutcheson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*John Hutcheson (1853\u20131940), Scottish-New Zealand politician", "*John Hutcheson (footballer) (1909\u20131979), Scottish footballer (Falkirk, Chelsea)"]}]}}
