However, a previous endeavor from the year before would come to bear fruit. During her Brora research, Stopes had been in correspondence with several high-profile Geologists of the time, including John Wesley Judd and Albert Charles Seward, and these two men helped Stopes secure her first major grant, which she had applied for in 1906. The purpose of this \u00a385 grant was to allow her to conduct her research into Mesozoic coal balls in Japan, and on 19 May 1907, it was granted by the Royal Society. In six weeks, Stopes concluded her Brora research, and made arrangements to depart for Japan on 3 July 1907. She spent eighteen months at the Imperial University, Tokyo and explored coal mines on Hokkaido for fossilized plants. As with the Brora study, Stopes failed to locate any Mesozoic coal balls in Japan either, but did manage to discover many important fossils, such as the Cretaceous angiosperm floras, which she wrote about in her 1909 article \u201cPlant containing nodules from Japan\u201d for the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, London. She also published her Japanese experiences as a diary, called \"Journal from Japan: a daily record of life as seen by a scientist\", in 1910."]}, {"page": "Wollaston Medal", "response": ["*1891 John Wesley Judd"]}, {"page": "1891 in science", "response": ["* Wollaston Medal for Geology: John Wesley Judd"]}, {"page": "Royal School of Mines", "response": ["* John Wesley Judd, President of the Geological Society (1886\u20131888)."]}, {"page": "Lewis Leigh Fermor", "response": ["Fermor was initially interested in continuing a career in metallurgy but was persuaded to apply to the Geological Survey of India by his professor, John Wesley Judd. The interview was by W. T. Blanford, then retired, and he was selected despite his expertise in chemistry rather than geology. Blanford may have seen the value of his expertise for the study of crystalline archaean rocks and Fermor would indeed later work extensively on petrology. He arrived in India in 1902, having accepted a position as assistant superintendent in the Geological Survey of India.  He was one of the founders of geology in India. His major interest was in Archaean geology, and in igneous and metamorphic rocks.  He was curator of the geology collection at the Indian Museum from 1905 to 1907.  He did important work on deposits of manganese and coal, and he was awarded a Doctorate of Science by London University in 1909. He first described the mineral Hollandite in 1906 and the mineral Fermorite, discovered in 1910, is named after him. He became a superintendent in the Geological Survey of India in 1910, and was awarded an OBE for his work for the Indian Railway Board and then the Indian Munitions Board during the First World War."]}]}}
