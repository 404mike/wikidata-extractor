His father's partner in the undertaking was his uncle, his mother's brother William Gooderham who joined them from England in 1832.\nHis father gave James considerable independent authority, even though he was a teenager, including overseeing the difficult transport of millstones by water, up the St. Lawrence River and across Lake Ontario from Montreal. His mother died in childbirth in 1834 and his father committed suicide two weeks later by drowning himself in a well on his own company's property.\nWilliam Gooderham took charge of the business and responsibility for his nephew after James Worts death. In 1837 a distillery was added and in 1845 Worts became a partner in his uncle's firm, which was renamed Gooderham and Worts.\nWorts children included:\n\nJames Gordon Worts 1843-1846\nJames Gooderham 1853-1884 - whose son James-Gooderham Worts II was named for James Goodherham\nThomas Frederick Worts 1857-?\nCharlotte Louisa Worts - married William Henry Beatty", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wort (disambiguation)", "response": ["* James Gooderham Worts (1818-1882) Canadian distiller"]}, {"page": "William Cawthra", "response": ["William Cawthra is credited, alongside James Gooderham Worts and William Gooderham, Sr., with establishing Canada's first infectious disease centre at the Toronto General Hospital. William was a founding and active member of the Toronto House of Industry, established in 1837 with a similar model to Dickensian workhouses, helping those in the city who were desperate for food, distributing coal to assist the needy to survive the harsh Toronto winters, providing temporary and permanent accommodations and assisting abandoned children or those who were orphans. William was also a patron of the Fenian Raids Volunteer Fund, St. James Cathedral and numerous other charities."]}, {"page": "William Gooderham Sr.", "response": ["In 1837, he added a distillery to make efficient use of surplus and second-grade grain. Having taken Worts' son, James Gooderham Worts, under his guidance since Worts' death, they became partners in 1845 and renamed the company as Gooderham and Worts."]}, {"page": "Gooderham and Worts", "response": ["In 1834, Worts's wife, Elizabeth, died during childbirth. Two weeks later, Worts killed himself by throwing himself into the windmill's well and drowning. Gooderham continued the business himself. With a surplus of wheat, Gooderham expanded in 1837 into brewing and distilling, and soon this lucrative trade became the primary focus of the business. Gooderham served as the sole manager of the business until 1845, when he made Worts's eldest son, James Gooderham Worts, co-manager."]}, {"page": "James Worts", "response": ["Having first constructed a flour mill in his hometown in Suffolk, England, he eventually moved to York, Upper Canada with his eldest son, James Gooderham Worts in 1831. Once there, he set up another windmill which was completed in 1832."]}, {"page": "William Henry Beatty", "response": ["Chadwick's short-lived marriage to Ellen may have helped cement the partnership, but the success of the firm was intimately connected with Beatty's marriage.  In April 1865, Beatty remarried Charlotte Louisa Worts at Little Trinity Anglican Church. She was the eldest daughter of James Gooderham Worts, was one of the two partners in the Gooderham & Worts distillery and milling business and an important figure in a number of other businesses."]}, {"page": "Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway", "response": ["Businessmen in Toronto were becoming interested in capturing some of this traffic for themselves, as well as providing transport for goods they were personally interested in. The first attempt was backed by William Gooderham, Sr., James Gooderham Wortss and Henry Pellatt, who chartered the Toronto and Nipissing Railway (T&N) in 1869 to build a narrow gauge line with the ultimate aim of reaching the Ottawa Valley. After opening as far as Uxbridge in 1871, the contractor walked away from the job, leaving the partially completed line to Coboconk. With the T&N stalled, in 1874, George Laidlaw, who had been instrumental in setting up the T&N, chartered the competing Victoria Railway with roughly the same goals. The Victoria likewise ran out of money after reaching Haliburton late in 1878."]}]}}
