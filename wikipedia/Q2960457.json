Brown seems to have resented her pushiness, and only allowed her to print twenty-five editions of her etchings, although Arthur Lismer had printed one hundred and Charles William Jefferys had printed fifty. Her prints were among the best produced under the program, vividly depicting the \"hustle and forced pace\" of the work. Her pictures showed both women and men working, including women making shells and men in a steel plant. Her picture of a heavy-shell factory shows both men and women working on the assembly line. Stevens made draft plates of Montreal factories, but the program ran out of funding before approval could be given for the work.
