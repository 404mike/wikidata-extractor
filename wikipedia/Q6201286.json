United used the city of Sheffield's coat of arms from 1965\u201377, when a new crest was used, introduced by former manager Jimmy Sirrel, but designed apparently over 20 years previously by former player Jimmy Hagan. This consisted of two white crossed swords, or blades, the club's nickname, with a Yorkshire Rose above, on a black background. This is surrounded by a red ring with \"Sheffield United F.C.\" written around the top and \"1889\", the year the club was founded, underneath. This has been altered very slightly a few times, with a simple black embroidered crest appearing on shirts from 1987\u201390, and an all-white crest on a red-edged black shield for the 1992\u201399 seasons, but reverted to its original form in 2000.", "Experienced Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy was the man United turned to replace John Harris. He initially did well but the team was ageing and there was little money to replace players.  After a good finish in his first season a disastrous string of results the following year led to Furphy being sacked in October 1975. Jimmy Sirrel was recruited from Notts County but he proved unpopular with both the players and fans and could not halt the decline, overseeing relegation and then being sacked in September 1977 with United at the bottom of Division Two. The ambitious and colourful Harry Haslam was handed the reigns and although many of his ideas were ahead of their time he built an ageing side based on 'star' players at the end of their career. Now in the Third Division performances deteriorated still further and Haslam stepped down due to illness in January 1981. World Cup winner and then United player Martin Peters was promoted to the position of manager but United were relegated to Division Four at the end of the season and Peters resigned."]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["The club were back in the Third Division South by World War II, but were again promoted as champions in 1949\u201350 and spent most of the 1950s in the second tier before successive relegations saw them drop back into the Fourth Division. County won promotion as runners-up in 1959\u201360. They returned to the fourth tier by 1964, but were promoted as champions in the 1970\u201371 season, before securing promotion out of the Third Division under the stewardship of Jimmy Sirrel in 1972\u201373. They made their return to the top flight by finishing as runners-up of the Second Division in 1980\u201381. County were relegated after a three-season stay, and ended the decade back in the third tier, before Neil Warnock masterminded play-off successes in 1990 and 1991 that saw them promoted back into the top flight. However they were immediately relegated, thus missing out on the first-ever season of Premier League football. They fell back into the basement division by 1997\u201398, but managed to finish the season as champions. Following a financial crisis they were relegated again in 2004, before they won the League Two title in 2009\u201310 amid a takeover bid from a Middle Eastern consortium that eventually fell through despite great publicity and initial expectations. County were relegated back to the bottom tier at the end of the 2014\u201315 season, and remained there until the end of the 2018\u201319 season, when they were relegated from the Football League for the first time.", "thumb|right| Jimmy Sirrel & Jack Wheeler statue at Meadow Lane", "The Magpies struggled during the 1960s, being on the brink of financial ruin and striving to avoid the indignity of having to apply for re-election to the league. This situation continued until Jack Dunnett, a local member of parliament, took control of the club. He appointed Jimmy Sirrel, a charismatic Scot who had once played for Celtic, as manager in November 1969. In the 1970\u201371 season, County clinched the Fourth Division title in record-breaking style, remaining unbeaten at Meadow Lane. Two seasons later, Notts County were again promoted, this time to Division Two. Sirrel departed for Sheffield United in October 1975 but returned two years later. He completed the remarkable transformation of Notts County in May 1981. He had turned The Magpies from Fourth Division strugglers to a top division side in little over a decade, ending an absence of 55 years from the top flight. This achievement was with the same chairman (Jack Dunnett) and trainer (Jack Wheeler) throughout the decade.", "Jimmy Sirrel took charge of the team once again, and while the club's form improved, it came too late, and County suffered their second successive relegation. After two decent but unremarkable finishes in the Third Division, Sirrel finally retired in 1987, bringing to a close one of the most successful and memorable periods in Notts County's history.", "|align=left|Jimmy Sirrel", "|align=left|Jimmy Sirrel", "|align=left|Jimmy Sirrel"]}, {"page": "1922 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 February \u2013 Jimmy Sirrel, footballer and football manager (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["He returned to Notts County to work as a coach and chief scout from 1968 to 1970.

He was interviewed by Eamonn Andrews on ITV's Today programme on his fall from England star to the unemployment line. After his financial troubles became public knowledge he was offered a lucrative job as director of his own subsidiary furniture company by a large furnishing company on Tottenham Court Road; however the company went into liquidation the following year. He continued to write cheques in the company's name, and in June 1972 pleaded Guilty to seven charges of obtaining goods and cash by deception.

The Meadow Lane End was demolished in 1978 and replaced by a building which housed new dressing rooms, a social club and a variety of other facilities designed to generate more income. There was no stand at this end for several years and Meadow Lane was reduced to a three sided ground. Eventually a small terrace was installed on this side. The Bradford City stadium fire and Hillsborough disaster brought the safety of football stadia into the public gaze and eventually the Taylor Report required that football clubs modernise their grounds. Meadow Lane was subsequently redeveloped during the early 1990s, although the work was planned before the report was issued. The Meadow Lane End, County Road Stand and Spion Kop were all demolished in the 1992 close season and replaced with the Family Stand, the Jimmy Sirrel Stand and the Spion Kop Stand respectively. The Main Stand was replaced during the close season of 1994 by the Derek Pavis Stand.", "Away supporters are normally restricted to the Jimmy Sirrel stand, at the County Road side.
