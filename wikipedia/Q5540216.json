The pre-season consisted of selling top striker Tom Nolan to Bradford Park Avenue and manager Holford talking of a 'young players policy'. The season finished in a second-from-bottom finish and another plea for donations to survive financially. Warney Cresswell was appointed as manager for the club's 1936\u201337 campaign, with the aim of promotion. Tom Nolan was also brought back from Bradford. After a mid-table finish Creswell left the club. A young Eric Hayward was transferred to Blackpool, Ken Gunn moved onto Northampton Town and Allan Todd went to Nottingham Forest. Roger Jones also ended his fourteen-year association with the club. In December 1937 Tom Morgan was reinstated as manager. He was unable to prevent the 1937\u201338 season being another story of mid-table mediocrity. Jack Roberts impressive tally of 28 goals was the only ray of hope for escaping the division. At the end of the season roughly half the team were transferred or let go. Notable new faces for the 1938\u201339 campaign were goalkeeper Arthur Jepson, defender George Collin and right-half George Hannah. The club was also transferred to the Third Division South, good news as the league saw higher gate receipts. The club failed to have any impact on the division though, and were fighting to avoid a re-election battle rather than achieve promotion, as injuries hit the squad."]}, {"page": "George Lamb Hannah", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Hannah (footballer, born 1914)"]}, {"page": "George Hannah", "response": ["George Hannah may refer to:", "*George Hannah (footballer, born 1914) (1914\u20131977), English footballer who played for Derby County and Port Vale", "*George Hannah (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20131990), English footballer who played for six clubs in Ireland and England"]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw another reconstruction of the first eleven, as eleven new signings arrived at The Old Recreation Ground, most notably: highly rated goalkeeper Arthur Jepson (Grantham Town); veteran left-back George Collin (Sunderland); right-half George Hannah (Derby County); left-half Sid Wileman (signed from Derby for 'a substantial fee'); and goalscoring winger John Callender (Lincoln City).
