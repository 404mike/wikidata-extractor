Chinese ladies were reluctantly to let strangers, let alone foreigners, enter their boudoirs. Rumors of British soldiers seeking to rape Chinese women arose. In one instance, on May 19, the Whitewash Brigade was pelted with stones, bricks and rubbish. In another instance, around 100 women, relatives of the deceased, organized a meeting at Tung Wah Hospital, where they wailed and cried against the community leaders and hospital administration. The government responded to the meeting by forbidding searchers to enter Chinese households without permission, and by allowing patients to choose Chinese treatment in Chinese hospitals. Members of the Chinese community continued to petition Governor William Robinson to halt the cleansing operations completely, and to allow patients to travel to China to seek treatment. Robinson initially refused, but when compradors of major hongs threatened to have their staff leave their posts, Robinson allowed patients to travel to Guangzhou for treatment, and corpses to be transported there for burials. However, the whitewashing operations was to be continued."]}, {"page": "Victor Montagu (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["Montagu was promoted to captain in February 1877 and was given command of the corvette  in September 1882. Montagu commanded Garnet when it was involved in an incident in Grenada. Having sought the unofficial permission of Sir William Robinson in Barbados to destroy the offices of the The Grenada People newspaper, Garnet sailed for Grenada where a detachment went ashore and threatened to destroy the offices and press of the newspaper; however, the crew did not carry out their threats, but Montagu wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper, threatening to horsewhip him for criticising Robinson's governorship of Barbados. This prompted a debate in the House of Commons. Montagu retired from active service in January 1885, having decided to do so as his deafness, which he had contracted from malaria during the mutiny, had become profoundly worse, coupled with other personal affairs.Montagu 1898, p. 206 He was placed on the retired list following his retirement. In 1892, whilst still on the retired list, Montagu was promoted to rear admiral."]}]}}
