Personal relationships with prominent figures in Irish public life enabled him both to explore and to influence opinion in a way conducive to the Convention\u2019s progress.Turner notes (Lloyd George's Secretariat, p. 93) that\u00a0T. P. Gill\u00a0had been Adams\u2019s colleague in the Department of Agriculture (the pair attended the International Agricultural Conference in Rome in December 1909). Other examples are his relationships with\u00a0fellow delegates to the Convention such as George Russell,\u00a0well-known to Adams on account of his service with Plunkett\u2019s Irish Agricultural Organisation;\u00a0Stephen Gwynn,\u00a0a relative of Adams\u2019s wife; and Bishop\u00a0Denis Kelly\u00a0of Ross, who had been a fellow member of the Primrose Committee. His correspondence with Plunkett became the principal line of communication between the United Kingdom Government and the Convention and, from December 1917 onwards, he orchestrated government policy in an attempt to avoid the Convention\u2019s collapse.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, pp. 85, 122. In October 1917 Plunkett suggested that Adams should be appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in place of\u00a0Henry Duke: Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, p.117. His was the principal hand in drafting the Government\u2019s proposals accepted by a majority (but an inadequate majority) of the Convention in April 1918 and, after the Convention initiative was spent, he played a major part in preparation of a new Home Rule Bill.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, pp. 116, 120."]}, {"page": "Evelyn Gleeson", "response": ["Gleeson was interested in Irish affairs, through her membership of the Gaelic League and the Irish Literary Society.

She was a member of the suffrage movement and served as chairwoman of the London women's club, the Pioneer Club. In 1900 the opportunity arose to contribute to the Irish revival and suffrage for Irish women. On the advice of her friend Augustine Henry, Gleeson moved away from London smog to Ireland to improve her health, and offered her the finances to establish her own craft centre in the form of a loan of \u00a3500. She discussed these plans with the Yeats sisters, Elizabeth and Lily, who although they were talented craftswomen with a network of influential contacts, they could not contribute any money to the venture. Gleeson also consulted with W. B. Yeats, Jack Butler Yeats, and her cousin T. P.

Having been a supporter of William Ewart Gladstone, Sinclair joined the Ulster Liberal Party in 1868, supporting the land acts of 1870 and 1881. Following the home rule bill of 1886, he convened a meeting in the Ulster Hall of liberals on 30 April 1886 which passed a resolution in condemnation of the bill. Forming the Ulster Liberal Unionist Association, of which he was chair, he organised the Ulster Convention in Belfast. Held on 17 June 1892, it saw 11,879 Ulster unionists meet to protest home rule. 9 months after the Convention, Sinclair was appointed to the executive committee of the new unionist clubs, which were founded to protect the union. The defeat of the British Liberal party in 1895 significantly decreased the threat of home rule, leading to the unionists clubs being suspended, and Sinclair returning to his activities in liberal reform. He was the leading Ulster member of the recess committee from 1895, which was founded by Horace Plunkett. He supported Plunkett's backing of T. P. Gill as secretary of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society in 1899, in the face of strong protest by conservative unionists."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth O'Shea Dillon", "response": ["Elizabeth O'Shea Dillon was born in 1842 in Nenagh, County Tipperary.
