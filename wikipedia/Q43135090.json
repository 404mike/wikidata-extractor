His varied artistic vocabulary encompasses performance, video, photography, painting, sculpture and installation. Peake's main focus lies in the lapses and voids inherent in the process of translating between verbal language and nonverbal modes of communication. It is in the discrepancy between words and any other language, say, images, emotions, bodily movements or sounds, that his art is located. Peake's work is an often-energetic spectacle in which the absurd and the erotic each find a place, and in which the artist plays a central role.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Piccadilly Circus", "response": ["CIRCA is an art platform based in London's Piccadilly Circus.Buck, Louisa \u201cNew public art project in London will show works by Ai Weiwei and Eddie Peake on Europe's largest billboard\u201d, The Art Newspaper, 24 September 2020.
