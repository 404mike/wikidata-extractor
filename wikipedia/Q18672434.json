Gosselin joined the Royal Navy in 1778 and as a junior officer had extensive service in the American Revolution, including participating in the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782. Promoted to commander in April 1793, Gosselin took part in the Glorious First of June as commander of HMS Kingfisher. He was promoted to post-captain in July 1795 and took command of a variety of ships including most notably HMS Syren, HMS Latona, and HMS Audacious. Gosselin frequently served on blockade duties in the English Channel and on convoy duties to and from the West Indies.\nHis final services at sea in 1809 included his assistance in the evacuation from Corunna of the army of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore. Gosselin refused command of HMS Cressy in 1810 due to health issues and never served at sea again. He was promoted to rear-admiral in June 1814 and admiral in November 1841. In October 1854 Gosselin became the most senior admiral in the Royal Navy but was never promoted to admiral of the fleet, either because of the long length of time since his last service at sea or because of his ongoing health issues.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
