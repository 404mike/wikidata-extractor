To the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the 1981\u201382 season, after falling out with the chairman, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1\u20130 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal. The following season Villa were crowned European Super Cup winners, beating Barcelona 3\u20131 on aggregate. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s, due to financial mismanagement Saunders' team was broken up, culminating in relegation in 1987, just five years after being crowned European champions.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 148. However, Villa bounced back quickly, achieving promotion the following year under Graham Taylor and a runners-up position in the top-flight in the 1989\u201390 season.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 155."]}, {"page": "Ormskirk", "response": ["* Tony Morley (born), England and Aston Villa footballer, European Cup winner in 1982"]}, {"page": "Chris Nicholl", "response": ["Chris is currently the manager of Aston Villa Old Stars, who regularly play in testimonial and charity matches.
