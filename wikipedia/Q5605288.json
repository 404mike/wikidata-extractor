Midway through the first half the home side took the lead with a goal from Gordon Cowans.  Paul Simpson's shot struck the post and as the Millwall goalkeeper Kasey Keller failed to gather the rebound, Cowans struck low to score his first goal in 19 months.  Derby dominated the second half and doubled their lead when Seth Johnson scored on 60 minutes having been sent clear by Marco Gabbiadini; the match ended 2\u20130.  The second leg was played three days later at the New Den in London and was marred by two pitch invasions by Millwall supporters.  Gabbiadini put Derby ahead on 16 minutes after converting a cross from Mark Pembridge.  Johnson scored the second goal for Derby six minutes later.  Soon after fans ran onto the pitch and were confronted by mounted police officers; the players left the pitch while numerous arrests were made.  Play restarted nearly 20 minutes later, and Pat Van Den Hauwe extended Derby's lead with a goal three minutes before half time.  Greg Berry reduced the deficit with a header on the hour mark, making it 3\u20131.  Minutes later, just as the referee was about to award a penalty to Millwall, a second pitch invasion took place and the players retreated to the dressing rooms once again.  They returned to the pitch 12 minutes later whereupon the referee opted not to award the penalty.  No further goals were scored and Derby County progressed to the play-off final with an aggregate 5\u20131 victory.  After the game, Millwall's chairman Reg Burr claimed that the play-offs were \"a recipe for violence\" and argued \"they should be scrapped or else changed radically.\""]}]}}
