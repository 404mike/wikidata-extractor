Rae and Craddock both missed chances to score the winner for Sunderland, and extra time ended with the score level on 4\u20134; the match would need to be determined via a penalty shootout, which was to be conducted at the Sunderland end of the stadium. Sunderland went into the shootout without two of their regular penalty-takers as both Phillips and Clark had been replaced through injury.  Mendonca scored the first penalty, followed by Summerbee, Brown, Johnston, Keith Jones, Ball, Kinsella, Makin, Bowen and Rae, to make it 5\u20135 and take the shootout to sudden death. Robinson and Quinn then scored, to make it 6\u20136.  Shaun Newton then stepped up to give the advantage to Charlton.

In the FA Cup, Brentford advanced to the sixth round for the first time since the 1948\u201349 season.

Brentford also drew promotion-chasing Second Division opposition in the fifth round \u2013 Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. 3,000 travelling supporters watched Brentford hold Rovers at 0\u20130 until the 80th minute, when Gary Blissett scored the first of the only two goals of the match to put the Bees into the hat for the sixth round. Brentford were drawn against First Division giants Liverpool at Anfield, for a match which would be one of the club's biggest occasions of the postwar era.

With forward Gary Blissett failing to show form in front of goal and Andy Sinton almost single-handedly leading the attack from midfield, the loan signing of Paul Williams in October 1987 galvanised the team, with Williams scoring six goals in eight appearances before being recalled by Charlton Athletic.
