He also holds an appointment as Professorial Fellow at Roehampton University. His research focuses on cognitive factors affecting anxiety. Eysenck has written and co-written many publications, including several textbooks. In the late 1990s, he developed the theory of the \"hedonic treadmill\", stating that humans are predisposed by genetics to plateau at a certain level of happiness, and that the occurrence of novel happy events merely elevates this level temporarily.\nHe is the son of the noted psychologist Hans J\u00fcrgen Eysenck.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hans Eysenck", "response": ["Eysenck was Professor of Psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, from 1955 to 1983.
