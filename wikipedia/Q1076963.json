He is the co-author of A History of Thailand, Thaksin: The Business of Politics in Thailand, Thailand's Boom and Bust, and Thailand's Crisis, all written with his wife, Dr. Pasuk Phongpaichit. He was the principal writer of the United Nations Development Programme's Thailand Human Development Report 2007: Sufficiency Economy and Human Development, which praised King Bhumibol Adulyadej's self-sufficient economy theory.\nIn 2010, Chris Baker and his wife Pasuk Phongpaichit published a compilation and translation of the Thai epic poem Khun Chang Khun Phaen. The epic was published in a two volume set, which arranged the story in a narrative form suitable for modern English readers.  Copious footnotes and creative illustrations are also included. They have also published a version of their compilation in Thai.\nBaker was the recipient of the 2017 Fukuoka Prize together with his spouse and collaborator, Pasuk Phongpaichit. The prize is awarded annually to those who have made outstanding contributions to academia, arts, and culture in Asia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Baker", "response": ["Christopher or Chris Baker may refer to:", "*Chris Baker (artist) (born 1960), British science fiction artist", "*Chris Baker (defensive lineman) (born 1987), American football defensive lineman", "*Chris Baker (golfer) (born 1986), American professional golfer", "*Chris Baker (high jumper) (born 1991), British high jumper", "*Chris Baker (politician) (born 1958), Australian politician", "*Chris Baker (racing driver) (born 1969), race car driver", "*Chris Baker (talk radio host), American comedian and radio talk show host", "*Chris Baker (tight end) (born 1979), former American football tight end", "*Chris Baker (writer) (born 1948), Thailand-based British writer"]}, {"page": "The King Never Smiles", "response": ["Chris Baker, an independent academic residing in Thailand who wrote a report praising Bhumibol's self-sufficient economy theories for the United Nations, reviewed the book in the Asia Sentinel. Baker praised the book, but said that in its later chapters, it ignored the role of the Thai elite and middle class in reimagining Bhumibol as a symbol of democracy. Baker said that the middle class was key in \"rewriting history to cast the king as a peace-maker in 1973 and 1992, glossing over 1976 altogether, and ignoring the 1932 revolution to make democracy seem to be a gift from the throne.\"  Baker also said that the section of the book covering the 2005-2006 political crisis (which was still occurring at the time of the book's publication) included unspecified errors and failed to explain why various groups seized on the monarchy as the focus of opposition to the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. Baker said that although the book introduced little that was new for experts, it did bring everything together, including many obscure sources, in a way that \"connects the dots of a complex and important story with great narrative skill and very elegant prose.\" Furthermore, he said that the book did not \"stray off to imagine what is going on in the king's mind.\" He noted that the book was \"far from perfect,\" but was still \"streets ahead of the competition, especially the hilariously error-prone effort of William Stevenson seven years ago.\""]}, {"page": "Palang Dharma Party", "response": ["Thaksin's joining the Palang Dharma Party exacerbated existing conflict within the party. Specifically, a great number of PDP members objected to his holding the post of foreign minister, criticizing the appointment of \"outsiders\" such as new-generation businessmen to cabinet positions. Furthermore, after Chamlong relinquished party leadership to Thaksin in 1995, under the soon-to-be prime minister's leadership, the PDP moved in a direction increasingly distant from its founding Buddhist-inspired principles, thus further widening the divide between divergent party factions. Thaksin himself, as the face of the Phalang Dharma Party, served to further diminish the party's reputation with the public. Specifically, according to British writer Chris Baker and Thai economist Pasuk Phongpaichit, whereas Chamlong had steered the PDP in the direction of \"cleaner and more principled politics\", \"...in the public mind, Thaksin was a concession hunter associated with some of the most flagrant 'money politicians'... and with the corrupt and discredited 1991-2 coup junta.\""]}, {"page": "Pasuk Phongpaichit", "response": ["Pasuk earned BA and MA degrees in economics at Monash University in Australia, and received her PhD at Cambridge University in England.
