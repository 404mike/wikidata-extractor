In politics he was an ardent Whig. When his friend William Cobbett was in Newgate Prison, Bosville went in his coach and four to visit him, and afterwards gave him a cheque for \u00a31,000 as a token of sympathy with him in his persecutions. In appearance he was almost as eccentric as in his manners. He used always to dress in the style of a courtier of King George II, and wore a single-breasted coat, powdered hair and queue. In 1792 he was \nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He appears as a minor figure in several political caricatures by James Gillray and two portraits of him survived at Thorpe Hall in 1927.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rudston", "response": ["Thorpe Hall to the east of the village was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1952 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.
