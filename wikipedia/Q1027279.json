Born in northern England, she spent much of her childhood and later life in Belgium, where she studied at the Brussels Conservatory. After engagements in mainland Europe she made her London debut in 1856. Her singing career was mostly in concert, but in the first half of the 1860s she appeared in opera at Covent Garden and other leading London theatres.\nAfter she retired from performing, Lemmens-Sherrington became a teacher, at her old music college in Brussels, and at the Royal Academy of Music in London and the Royal Manchester College of Music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1906 in music", "response": ["*May 9 \u2013 Helen Lemmens-Sherrington, operatic soprano (born 1834)"]}, {"page": "Charles Santley", "response": ["Santley appeared in English opera for Mapleson at Her Majesty's Theatre in the 1860\u201361 season.
