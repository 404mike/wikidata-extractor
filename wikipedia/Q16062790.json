W.S. Peter's stock and station agents were Elder, Stirling & Co. The firm were also agents for Walter Hughes, who just a few months earlier had been the purchaser of W.S. Peter's Gum Creek Station. Hughes also had a pastoral run at Wallaroo, where in December 1859 a shepherd discovered copper ore, leading to the establishment of Wallaroo Mines. When another shepherd made a similar discovery in May 1861 several rival claimants rushed to make their applications but at first were uncertain as to the exact locality. This was to become the fabulously rich mines at Moonta. In order to divert attention and prevent a rush, Elders used W.S. Peter's name on the original claim for these mineral leases, later being transferred by him to Hughes and his Company. The losing syndicate cried foul on this subterfuge, leading to a State Select Committee, chaired by G.S. Kingston, leading to court action which was eventually settled out of court.Register newspaper, 26 September 1863, pp 4\u20135."]}, {"page": "Walter Watson Hughes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Walter Hughes (pastoralist)"]}, {"page": "Eremophila hughesii", "response": ["The species was first formally described in 1874 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae based on plant material collected between Barrow Range and Rawlinson Range during Ernest Giles's expedition.
