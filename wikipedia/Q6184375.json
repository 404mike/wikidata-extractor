In 2007, he was voted the 15th greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups. In the 2010 list, he was voted the 33rd greatest stand-up comic.Sadowitz is also widely acclaimed as one of the best close-up magicians in the world and an accomplished practitioner of sleight of hand, having written several books on magic and inventing several conjuring innovations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Jerry Sadowitz (born 1961)"]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Jerry Sadowitz (born 1961)"]}, {"page": "1961", "response": ["** Jerry Sadowitz, American-born British stand-up comic and card magician"]}, {"page": "Nick Hancock", "response": ["*The Pall Bearer's Revue starring Jerry Sadowitz"]}, {"page": "Stewart Lee", "response": ["His influences include Ted Chippington, Jerry Sadowitz, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.", "Lee's influences include Ted Chippington, Jerry Sadowitz, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas."]}, {"page": "Derren Brown", "response": ["Brown cites magician and comedian Jerry Sadowitz, whom he met at the International Magic shop in Clerkenwell, London, as being instrumental in his rise to stardom.
