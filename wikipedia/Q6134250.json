His father was a master mariner and was an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve; his great-grandfather, James Freeth, was Quartermaster General between 1851 and 1854, and his grandfather was a major-general as well. He attended Audlem grammar school in Cheshire beginning in 1896; the next year, the County Council built a laboratory at the school, sparking young Freeth's interest in the subject. He excelled at chemistry but had poor mathematical skills. On his second attempt, he passed the matriculation exam to study at Liverpool University from 1900, graduating with first-class honours in 1905 and then a master's degree in 1906. There, he studied under Frederick George Donnan, a physical chemist who would be a great influence on Freeth, who was quickly gaining reputation as a chemist himself."]}, {"page": "Freeth, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Freeth"]}]}}
