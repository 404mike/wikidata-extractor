The Liverpool Echo's Catherine Jones felt that \"Pascal and Maximus shamelessly scene-steal from the human characters\". The Illinois Times' Chuck Koplinski wrote, \"Throw in two animal sidekicks \u2013 wily horse Maximus and protective chameleon Pascal \u2013 and you have a film that, while not as moving as the Pixar movies, is a satisfying lark.\"  TV Guide opined that although \"There's nothing particularly innovative about Dan Fogelman's screenplay\", the author wrote that \"a cute animal sidekick ... extend[s] to the visual aspects of the film\". Similarly, Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote, \"This ride's a familiar one, but with  sidekicks such as horse-who-thinks-he's-a-dog Maximus and chameleon Pascal, it's thoroughly enjoyable.\" Although Dave White of Movies.com strongly panned Tangled, he dubbed Pascal and Maximus the film's \"Most Memorable Clich\u00e9\", writing that the characters \"are better than the movie deserves.\" White continued, \"they both steal scene after scene from the Cream of Wheat-like main characters\", concluding, \"I kept wishing I was watching a movie about just them.\" The Independent's Anthony Quinn, who was ambivalent towards the film, admitted that Pascal and Maximus \"provide some chuckles.\" Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out wrote, \"With two such bland heroes, it's good that plenty of attention is paid to the supporting characters, notably ... a bad tempered but loveable horse\", while Todd Hertz of Christianity Today called Maximus \"a more complex, multi-dimensional character than some movies' leads\". Despite calling the film \"bland\", the Houston Chronicle's Amy Biancolli called Maximus a \"stone cool\" character. Tyler Hanley Palo Alto Weekly, however, praised the entire ensemble as a whole, calling Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus \"a thoroughly enjoyable quartet.\" In a lone lukewarm review, James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Pascal \"among the least recognizable animal sidekicks (although he possesses amusing mannerisms).\""]}]}}
