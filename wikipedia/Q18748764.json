Maestracci claimed that the painting, which had been sold in 1996 through Christie's for $3.2 million, had been looted from Stettiner in Paris  during World War II. The complaint was withdrawn in 2012. In November 2015, Stettiner's estate filed an amended complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York again seeking title to Seated Man with a Cane from various Nahmad family members and the Helly Nahmad Gallery in New York. Arbitration was ongoing as of April 2016, with the defendants arguing that the painting had been legally purchased in good faith from Christie's, that Stettiner's claim of ownership was unproven, and that the Stettiner estate's case was bankrolled by individuals with a financial conflict of interest. In 2016, Nahmad\u2019s gallery organized and held the exhibition Selected Works by 20th Century Masters. That December at Art Basel, Nahmad sold the painting Made in Japan I by Jean-Michel Basquiat for $15 million.
