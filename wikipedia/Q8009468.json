King John later granted the manor to Geoffrey Fitzpeter, 1st Earl of Essex and it descended in that family until becoming Crown land again. Henry VIII granted it to Lord Audley, from whom it descended to his grandson, Thomas Howard, Baron Howard de Walden and Earl of Suffolk. It was acquired in 1715 by wealthy merchant Richard Chiswell, MP and remained in the Chiswell family for some 100 years. It then passed by marriage to the Vincent family who held it until 1882 when Mrs Cely-Trevilian, the last member of the family, sold it to William Fuller-Maitland of Stansted Mountfitchet Hall. By the First World War it had come into the possession of Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal. Later owners found Debden Hall too expensive to maintain, and so the house was demolished and part of the estate sold off in 1935."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Fuller-Maitland"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*William Fuller-Maitland (1844\u20131932), Liberal MP for Breconshire (1875\u20131895) and first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Brighton College", "response": ["*William Fuller-Maitland (1844\u20131932), cricketer and politician, Oxford blue, played for the MCC, the Gentlemen, I Zingari and Essex, Liberal MP for Breconshire 1875\u201395"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Fuller-Maitland"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Fuller-Maitland"]}, {"page": "1864 English cricket season", "response": ["|William Fuller-Maitland ||Oxford University || 1117 || 521 || 48 || 8/48 || 4 || 2|| 11.84 "]}, {"page": "List of sportsperson-politicians", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Fuller-Maitland, William\"|William Fuller-Maitland || Cricket (first-class) || MP for Breconshire (1875-1895)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Fuller-Maitland"]}, {"page": "Breconshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Fuller-Maitland"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|William Fuller-Maitland"]}, {"page": "Sir Francis Vincent, 10th Baronet", "response": ["Vincent died intestate on 6 July 1880, Debden Hall passed to his daughter Blanche, who sold it to William Fuller-Maitland two years later.
