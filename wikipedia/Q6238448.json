In 1963 Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster, decided to demolish the main part of the Waterhouse building and the private wing, retaining the chapel, clock tower and stables.  A new building was commissioned by the Duke who appointed John Dennys, his wife's brother-in-law, as architect. Dennys had earlier worked on Saighton Grange on the Eaton estate. The intention was to build a modern, manageable home.  The result was a rectangular, flat-roofed building, faced with white Travertine, its \"whiteness [being] a stark contrast to the softness of the Cheshire landscape\". Its construction began in 1971, it took less than \u00a0years to build, and cost \u00a3459,000 (). The exterior had a central porte-coch\u00e8re on the entrance front.
