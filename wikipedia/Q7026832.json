The festival is now an annual event, taking place each August at Escot Park, near Fairmile in Devon, England. In February 2004, the Levellers played a special acoustic gig at the Buxton Opera House. Although they had played a couple of shows in a similar format, this particular show saw the full band being joined onstage for collaborations with Maddy Prior, Nick Harper, Nick Burbridge, and Rev Hammer. The show set the tone for the rest of the year, with the band appearing at many festivals through the summer in the acoustic guise, including the Beverley Folk Festival in June. These festival dates included their first visit to Glastonbury since 1997, where they captured another audience record on the Avalon Stage. The year was rounded off with an acoustic tour of UK theatres."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Nick Burbridge, author of poetry, plays, novel; songwriter-founder of folk rock McDermott's Two Hours"]}, {"page": "Fred Holroyd", "response": ["Holroyd wrote the book War without Honour with Nick Burbridge.
