He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace off-break bowler who played for Glamorgan. He was born in Blean and died in Battersea.\nOriginally a member of Cardiff Cricket Club in 1900, he quickly became a regular for the side, taking 12 for 77 in 1903, with his combination of expert spin and medium-pace. Nash left Cardiff in 1911, moved to Lancashire, to play for Haslingden, and later to Cardiff to play for Uddingston, where he stayed until 1919.\nHe made his first-class debut in Glamorgan's first County Championship match, against Sussex in May 1921. At 47 years and 271 days old he was the oldest man ever to make his Championship debut. Nevertheless, he was Glamorgan's leading bowler in 1921, taking 90 wickets \u2013 more than twice as many as anyone else for the county that year \u2013 at an average of 17.34. He played on in 1922, then retired. He became a first-class umpire in 1926, a position he held until 1930.\nNash was a tailend batsman throughout his career, alongside team-mates such as one-time county cricketer Sam Lowe, who had over 50 Minor Counties appearances to his credit, and later in his career, the likes of Harry Creber.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Bancroft", "response": ["Bancroft was a tailend batsman alongside teammate Jack Nash."]}, {"page": "Jack Nash", "response": ["Jack Nash may refer to:", "*Jack Nash (English cricketer) (1873\u20131956), English cricketer", "*Jack Nash (Australian cricketer) (born 1950), Australian cricketer", "*Jack Nash (businessman) (1929\u20132008), American hedge fund pioneer"]}, {"page": "Cliff Bowen", "response": ["Bowen is first recorded in a cricket game in 1891 when he turned out at lower order for Llanelli against a Llandovery team. Despite coming in to bat at number ten, he was not among the bowlers that day. By 1908, Bowen was playing in the Minor Counties Championships, representing Carmarthanshire against Monmouthshire. After Monmouthshire first innings total of 313, Carmarthenshire were skittled out for an embarrassing 41, with Bowen losing his wicket for a duck. The second innings fared little better for Carmarthanshire, but Bowen at least got on the board with seven runs from a team 101 total. In the next game of the 1908 Championship, played against Glamorgan at The Gnoll, Bowen was the opening batsman. He ended the first innings on a far more respectable 27, bowled by Jack Nash. Although Carmarthenshire again lost by an innings, Bowen made 64 in his second stand, the second highest total of the match. The Glamorgan team Bowen faced that day contained former Welsh rugby international Billy Bancroft, who was Bowen's fullback in all four of his international appearances. After another encounter with Glamorgan, which resulted in a third consecutive loss by an innings, Carmarthenshire hosted Devon at Stradey Park. Bowen came in to bat at fourth in both games, which ended in a familiar defeat for Carmarthenshire."]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jack Nash (1921\u20131922) : A.
