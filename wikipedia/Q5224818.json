In the summer of 1993, Huddersfield Town paid \u00a355,000 for his combative midfield services where he became a firm fans' favourite for his no-holds-barred style of play and aggressive tackling. In 1995, he was a major part in Huddersfield Town winning promotion to the Division One as Division Two playoff winners, and reaching the FA Cup fifth round (losing to Wimbledon in the replay) and finishing eighth in the league a year later, narrowly missing out on a second successive promotion.\nIn 1997, he moved to Swindon Town for \u00a3400,000 where he made 71 appearances and scored twice during two years at the County Ground from where he moved to Bury in 1999 for \u00a3200,000 - making 63 appearances and scoring nine times.\nHe was loaned out to Rushden & Diamonds and Sheffield United (where he was reunited with Neil Warnock who signed him for Huddersfield) before being released on a free transfer to Worcester City.

On 30 September 1999, he travelled overseas to play for Bury in Greater Manchester, England. He became only the second Indian footballer to play professionally in Europe after Mohammed Salim. By penning a three-year contract he also became the first Indian footballer to sign for a European club. This followed unsuccessful trials for Bhutia with Fulham, West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa. He had difficulty obtaining a visa and could not make his debut, until 3 October 1999 against Cardiff City. In that match, he came on as a substitute for Ian Lawson and played a part in Bury's second goal, which was scored by Darren Bullock after Bhutia's volley was deflected into his path. On 15 April 2000, he scored his first goal in the English league in the game against Chesterfield. A recurring knee injury limited him to only three games in his final season at Bury, and he was released after the club was placed in administration. His final appearance was a 3\u20130 defeat to Swindon Town on 27 August 2001."]}, {"page": "Neil Warnock", "response": ["Warnock was quick to inject new blood into the Terriers' side, snapping up goalkeeper Steve Francis, Darren Bullock, Ronnie Jepson, Tom Cowan and Pat Scully during his first season, all of whom would go on to become mainstays in the 1994\u201395 promotion season. He also showed faith in Centre of Excellence products such as Chris Billy, Simon Baldry and Andy Booth \u2013 a player then struggling to make the breakthrough who would go on to become a club legend in modern times. Despite these acquisitions, Town struggled for most of the 1993\u201394 season, their last at Leeds Road, and Warnock was quick to offload fan favourites Iwan Roberts, Iffy Onoura and Chris Marsden while introducing a more direct style of play. The run to the 1994 Football League Trophy Final (lost on penalties to Swansea City) coincided with an upturn in league form and a mass optimism further bolstered by the move to the new Alfred McAlpine Stadium for the 1994\u201395 season. Warnock's side won the Yorkshire Electricity Cup in late 1994. Warnock's side were genuine contenders for automatic promotion until falling away in the final few games to finish 5th (the final play-off spot that season owing to league re-structuring). They triumphed on penalties over second-placed Brentford after two thrilling ties and went on to beat Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium.

Nicky Forster levelled the game four minutes before half-time with a volley from a Paul Smith pass.  The second half was goalless and the match ended 1\u20131.

The Brentford goalkeeper Kevin Dearden then fumbled the ball under pressure from Darren Bullock which allowed Booth to equalise, and the first half ended level.  No goals were scored in the second half so the game went to extra time which also remained goalless with Grainger's last-minute free-kick being blocked.
