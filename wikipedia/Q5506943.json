Peng was the Nationalist government's banquet chef and fled with Kuomintang forces to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. There he continued his career as official chef until 1973, when he moved to New York to open a restaurant. One new dish, General Tso's chicken, was originally prepared without sugar and subsequently altered to suit the tastes of \"non-Hunanese people\". The popularity of the dish has led to it being adopted by local Hunanese chefs and food writers. When Peng opened a restaurant in Hunan in the 1990s introducing General Tso's chicken, the restaurant closed without success, as the locals found the dish too sweet."]}, {"page": "Yuan Mei", "response": ["The food writer Fuchsia Dunlop has described Yuan as \"China\u2019s Brillat-Savarin,\"   and Endymion Wilkinson called him one of the four classical gastronomes.Endymion Wilkinson, Chinese History: A Manual (Cambridge, MA.: Harvard University Press, Rev. and enl., 2000): 634.

In a time when the taste among his contemporaries was for opulence and exotic display, Yuan stood for the \"orthodox\" style. \"Nowadays,\" he wrote, \"at the start of the feast the menu is about a hundred feet long\". This is \"mere display, not gastronomy\". After one such dinner Yuan returned home and cooked congee to appease his hunger. He instructed cooks \"do not fuss with the natural state of the food just to show that you are a clever cook. Bird's nest is beautiful -- why shape it into balls?\" Yuan criticized his contemporary Li Liweng's magnolia pudding as \"created by artifice\". Yuan also resented what he regarded as the corruption of Chinese food by Manchu cooks. The appeal of Manchu cooking was in their stews and roasts, while Chinese cooked broths and soups, but when Manchus serve Chinese dinners and Chinese serve Manchu food, \"we lose our originality\" and we \"toady to each other\".Hsiang-Ju Lin and Tsuifeng Lin.

By baking the sodium bicarbonate, water vapor and carbon dioxide gas are released, and what is left is the alkaline sodium carbonate. Only a very small of amount of the resultant sodium carbonate is used in the preparation of McGee's pasta dish, just 1 teaspoon of it to 1-1/2 cups of semolina flour.  When preparing the pasta, the sodium carbonate is first dissolved in a small quantity of water, which is then slowly added to the semolina.  Afterwards, the kneaded dough is allowed to rest for an hour and is then rolled out very thin through a pasta machine and processed into the desired form of noodles."]}, {"page": "Maria Guarnaschelli", "response": ["Maria Guarnaschelli (April 18, 1941 \u2013 February 6, 2021) was an American cookbook editor and publisher.
