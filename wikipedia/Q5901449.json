Ford's 1859 text \"Archery: Its Theory and Practice\". As understanding was gained about the arrow flexing around and out of the way of the bow as it is shot (as first filmed by Clarence Hickman) and then experiencing oscillating back-and-forth bending as it travels toward the target, this dynamic flexing has incorrectly become a common usage of the term. This misuse sometimes causes misunderstanding on the part of those only familiar with modern target bows, which often have risers with an eccentrically cutout \"arrow window\";  being \"centre shot\", these bows do not exhibit any paradoxical behaviour as the arrow is always pointing visually along its line of flight."]}, {"page": "Horace Ford", "response": ["* Horace A.
