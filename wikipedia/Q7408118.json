With less money at his disposal than his predecessor Garry Hill, Still began overhauling the squad, signing players from further down the league pyramid such as Craig Mackail-Smith, Shane Blackett, Scott Griffiths and Glen Southam, while allowing 15 players to leave.

Players that Still has developed that have gone on to play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle. Dagenham & Redbridge managing director Steve Thompson has stated that Still's ability to do this kept the club consistently able to compete while operating on a far smaller budget than its rivals. Still's reputation for nurturing talent, combined with his vast array of contacts within the game gained through decades of coaching, have also led to highly rated young players from Premier League academies joining his teams on loan.
