He was professor of jurisprudence and political economy in Queen's College, Belfast, noted for challenging the Wages-Fund doctrine and for addressing contemporary agrarian policy questions.  A critic of Ricardian orthodoxy, he said that it had sidelined consumer behaviour and demand. He developed the idea of consumer sovereignty, but insisted that the analysis of demand should be based on historical and comparative institutional work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 21", "response": ["*1825 \u2013 Thomas Edward Cliffe Leslie, Irish economist and jurist (d. 1882)"]}, {"page": "Gustav von Schmoller", "response": ["The appellation \"Kathedersozialist\" was given to Schmoller and other members of the Verein by their enemies.
