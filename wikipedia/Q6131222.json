With the aid of television producer Sidney Cole, Carpenter and Knight were able to create a production deal for the show. Goldcrest Films, the US network Showtime, HTV and Gatetarn agreed to fund the series.Bernstein, Abbie. \"Legends of the Hooded Man : Richard Carpenter interview\". Starlog Magazine, issue 151, February 1990, (pgs.30-33,64). Robin of Sherwood was more expensive than Carpenter and Knight's previous series; each episode of Robin of Sherwood cost around \u00a3500,000 to film. Filming on Robin of Sherwood began in 1983. The show premiered in 1984, on ITV in the UK and on Showtime in the United States. There were three series, composed of a two-hour opening episode and 24 one-hour long episodes, although the pilot is sometimes screened as two one-hour episodes. The episodes comprising \"The Swords of Wayland\" were transmitted as one episode in the UK on their original screening, on a bank holiday weekend in 1985. The show was shot on film and almost entirely on location, mostly in the northeast and southwest of England; HTV West in Bristol was the base of operations, and most of the filming was done in and around Bristol and its surrounding counties.

Academic Jeremy Black agrees, although points out that the Bond and Leiter relationship suggested \"a far smoother working of the Anglo-American alliance than was in fact the case.\" Academic and writer Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, considered that this view of Leiter was partly because of Fleming's writing, noting that \"Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization\u00a0... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he\". Bond scholars Bennett and Woollacott note that although the two men share adventures, it is Bond who leads, not Leiter.

Media historian James Chapman agrees that  The Abominable Snowmen is the first Doctor Who serial to explore cryptozoology or mythology with an alien grounding, also citing it as having drawn from the gothic horror atmosphere and plot of Hammer's 1957 film The Abominable Snowman. He reflects that their second outing, in The Web of Fear, turned what was merely another monster when in the Himalayas into a nightmare by placing them in the identifiable setting of the London Underground. Chapman concludes that The Web of Fear also, by centring the Yeti threat in the London Underground, is part of a horror tradition where a 'chaos world' is located under the surface the ordinary."]}, {"page": "Susan Foreman", "response": ["Media historian James Chapman has written that the way Susan was written made her limited, because \"she was required to fill the role of the 'screamer' and often had little to do beyond looking pretty and frightened\".

The production office was keen to find new recurring monsters to be used instead of the retired Daleks and alongside the popular Cybermen. Brian Hayles was approached to create a suitable monster that could be used as a new recurring antagonist for the Doctor. He drew from newspaper reports of a baby mammoth found in 1900 in the Siberian ice, and from his interest in Mars, to create his monster. James Chapman suggests that director Derek Martinus drew from the Christian Nyby film The Thing from Another World in realising Hayles' scripts, particularly the concept of an alien frozen in ice near an isolated science base."]}, {"page": "Television documentary", "response": ["Televised documentary finds its roots in the media communication modes of film, photojournalism and radio.

As Bond walks across the screen, he is viewed by the audience through the barrel of a gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual .38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the \"James Bond Theme\", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.", "During Sean Connery's Bond films, the humour was delivered by Connery to soften a violent situation, such as the electrification, or his shooting a villain with a spear gun and saying \"I think he got the point\". The humour changed towards innuendo and self-mockery during the Roger Moore films, with his jokes delivered with what media historian James Chapman considered to be a \"wink at the audience\", with the suggestion that the violence was all a joke. This was shown in Live and Let Die when he threw the villain, Tee Hee, out of a train, removing his prosthetic arm in the process, Moore commented that he was \"Just being disarming, darling\". When Timothy Dalton took the role, the humour was downplayed, bringing the character more in line with that of the novels. The humour returned for the Brosnan films, "]}, {"page": "Portrayal of James Bond in film", "response": ["Connery's interpretation of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold-blooded than the literary version. Connery described Bond as \"a complete sensualist\u2014senses highly tuned, awake to everything, quite amoral. I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict\". Academic James Chapman observed that, for Dr. No, Connery's interpretation of the character, although not complete, showed the actor \"should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero in the manner of an American leading man\". In his second film, From Russia with Love, Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave \"a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style\". Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery \"personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming\u00a0... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part\"; academic Jeremy Black agreed, and declared that \"Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema\". Black also observed that Connery gave the character a \"spare, pared-down character\u00a0... [with] inner bleakness along with the style\". Connery played Bond with \"the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance\u00a0... against which all others are judged\". Raymond Benson perceived that Connery \"embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character\". Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains \"an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male\". Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that \"Sean was Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over\u2014he was rough, tough, mean and witty\u00a0... he was a bloody good 007\". However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery. Christopher Bray says of him that \"in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture\".", "When Sean Connery had been cast in November 1961, David Niven had been Fleming's choice for the role; the actor reflected the author's image of the character. In 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for Casino Royale, a film not made by Eon Productions. Connery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role. Niven was 56 when he played Bond and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the siege of Mafeking, had a daughter by his lover, the spy Mata Hari, played Claude Debussy on the piano, ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses. The concept of Bond is that once Niven's Bond retired, his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the \"other Bond\" was that played by Connery.", "James Chapman considers that Lazenby looks the part of Bond, identifying his athleticism and \"arrogant swagger\", which \"convey the snobbery of the character\". Chapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in Bond\u2014feeling exhausted and falling in love\u2014as opposed to the \"heroic superman\" of Connery. Brian Fairbanks noted that \"OHMSS gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, a man who can show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb\". Ben Macintyre also observed that of all the Bonds, Lazenby's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming's original literary character envisioned in the 1950s era of spy novels.", "Dalton's Bond was a serious one: dark, cold, stern, ruthless, showing little humour, and focused as a killer with little time for fun and indulgence. Dalton's interpretation of the character came from his \"desire to see a darker Bond\", one that was \"less of a womaniser, tougher and closer to the darker character Ian Fleming wrote about\". James Chapman also considered Dalton closer to Fleming's Bond than the previous actors, writing that Dalton was \"clearly less comfortable\u00a0... with the witty asides and one-liners\u00a0... so he becomes something closer to the Bond of the books, who rarely develops a sense of humour\". When reviewing Licence to Kill, Iain Johnstone of The Sunday Times disagreed, declaring that \"any vestiges of the gentleman spy\u00a0... by Ian Fleming\" have now gone; he went on to say that \"this character is remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the new Batman film\".", "After Timothy Dalton retired from the Bond role in 1994, Eon turned to the actor they had considered after A View to a Kill: Pierce Brosnan. He was offered a three-film contract, with an option on a fourth; his salary for his first film, GoldenEye, was $4\u00a0million, which rose to $16.5\u00a0million for his fourth and final outing, Die Another Day. Brosnan had first met Broccoli on the set of For Your Eyes Only, when Brosnan's wife, Cassandra Harris, was appearing in the film as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, and the couple lunched with Broccoli during filming. Brosnan went on to play a criminal-turned-private investigator in Remington Steele in the 1980s, where he captured some of the traits of previous Bonds in playing the role: like Moore, he exemplified a high degree of suavity, elegance, charm and wit, but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of Connery's Bond, both successfully \"combine the character's Englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing\". Andrew Spicer says that \"Brosnan's frame carries the 'Armani look' with its refined understated Englishness, to perfection. His lithe, sinuous athleticism is well suited to the fast-paced action and state-of-the-art gadgetry that retains the series' core appeal\". James Chapman also considered Brosnan's appearance striking, saying the actor had \"old-fashioned, darkly handsome matinee idol looks\".", "Brosnan's Bond was introduced in GoldenEye; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond into the history of the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the , previously seen in Goldfinger and Thunderball, \"thus immediately evoking the memory of [Sean] Connery\". Brosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being \"closer to the Fleming novels than Moore\u00a0... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton\". Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond not smoking. Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying \"I don't give a damn about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke\", although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in Die Another Day. Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals, and provided a \"mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour\"; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were \"flippant, but not crass\".", "Paul Arendt, writing for the BBC, agreed, observing that \"Daniel Craig is not a good Bond. He's a great Bond. Specifically, he is 007 as conceived by Ian Fleming\u2014a professional killing machine, a charming, cold-hearted patriot with a taste for luxury. Craig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine\". James Chapman commented on the realism and violence in the film, noting that Bond is seen to seriously bleed for the first time in the series; Chapman also identified a number of violent scenes which make Casino Royale notable in the series. In 2012 Skyfall was released; it was Craig's third outing as 007. Reviewing the film, Philip French, writing in The Observer, considered that Craig managed to \"get out of the shadow of Connery\", while the New Statesman thought that he had \"relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness\"."]}]}}
