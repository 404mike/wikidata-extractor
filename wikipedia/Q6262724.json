title The Secret of Monkey Island, with the intent of bringing the old game to a new audience. According to LucasArts, this announcement was \"just the start of LucasArts\u2019 new mission to revitalize its deep portfolio of beloved gaming franchises\".  Described by British journalist John Walker as a \"cautious toe in the water\" for LucasArts, the move was prompted by LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez, who had assumed the post only two months prior. According to Walker, many LucasArts employees had grown up playing the games from the 1990s, suggesting that should the renewed endeavour be successful, the developers would be keen to continue with further adventure titles."]}, {"page": "Cryo Interactive", "response": ["John Walker, who reviewed most of Cryo's games for PC Gamer and gave them all negative reviews, described the studio's work as \"always-awful but ever-so-sincere\", adding that the studio \"defied sense, taste, and coherence to produce an endless stream of the worst, most clumsy, most drearily pre-rendered Myst clones the world has ever seen\".

Inducting it into its hall of fame, GameSpy writer Rich Carlson wrote: \"With a tactical philosophy contrary to nearly every [first-person shooter] action game at that time, Thief rewarded stealth and sneaking over brazen frontal assault,\" continuing: \"While inadvertently undermining the notion that all action games need be shooters, it carved a completely new niche in the same already glutted genre.\" GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin argued that, while Metal Gear Solid, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins and Thief all defined the stealth action genre, it was Thief that displayed \"the purest depiction of what it might be like to slip from shadow to shadow\" and \"largely remains an unsurpassed achievement in gaming.\" In 2009, Thief was added to IGN's hall of fame. Sid Shuman, writing for GamePro, asserted that Thief \"pioneered its own genre ... the stealth-action title.\" John Walker of Eurogamer wrote in a retrospective review: \"Thief is an embarrassment to modern stealth games, each of which produces only a faded parody of this masterful original.\" In 2012, Mike Fahey of Kotaku called Thief \"the best stealth game I've ever played\", superior to modern games in the genre.

David Clayman of IGN commented: \"Still Life is an enjoyable albeit short diversion for fans of classic adventure games. As usual, this type of game controls better on a PC and character movement feels slow and clunky with the Xbox controller.\" Eurogamer's John Walker: \"There's a lot that Still Life does well, but in the same way adventure games were doing things well ten years ago. There is therefore no excuse for it to not manage other basic, fundamental elements when rehashing these decade-old ideas.\" Shannon Hall of Just Adventure: \"Anyone who loves a mystery and has an investigative mind will get many hours of pleasure from Still Life.\" Ryan Davis, writing for GameSpot: \"Its slavish dedication to convention will scratch the methodical, cerebral itch all diehard adventure game fans have.

Defconplay likewise cited Runaway, together with its sequels, as one of Spain's five best games. Weighing Runaways place globally, Gameblog, IGN Espa\u00f1a and Xataka named it one of the best adventure games ever. At the same time, writers for Adventure Gamers and Hardcore Gaming 101 have characterized Runaway as abnormally polarizing. Kurt Kalata of the latter publication wrote that \"many proclaimed the cartoonish adventure to be a return to form ... [but o]thers found it a harrowingly shallow experience\". John Walker of Rock, Paper, Shotgun recalled it as \"remarkably charmless, and sometimes even offensively so.\" Kalata was similarly critical. In Germany, Runaway inspired the popular term \"Runaway Syndrome\" to denote frustrating adventure game design. Adventure Gamers and Retro Gamer Germany have defined Runaway Syndrome as the need to examine a hotspot multiple times to acquire an item.

Goldstein similarly found problems with multiple pieces of evidence that all could point to the same contradiction, but where the game would only allow a specific one.
