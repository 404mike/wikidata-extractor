He was born in Aylsham, in the English county of Norfolk, one of the twelve children of Thomas and Ann Clover, who owned a drapery business in the town. Few details of his early years are known. He was engaged to be married, but his fianc\u00e9e, a local girl, died in 1801. He started his career as an engraver but was advised to give it up. Inspired to turn to portrait painting when the artist John Opie painted one of his relatives, he became Opie's pupil, and studied under him for four years. His paintings often use a generous amount of paint, handled freely in a fashion that was characteristic of Opie.\nClover inherited property and was paid well for his commissioned works. He lived an uneventful and comfortable life, mainly in London, where he was a prominent member of the Swedenborgian New Church. In 1809, he was selected to portray three of the mayors of Norwich, the decision based in part on his works exhibited at the Royal Academy that year. In 1811 he staged an exhibition of his works in Norwich. Although known during his life as a portrait painter, Clover also produced accomplished landscape paintings for his own pleasure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["File:Painting, 'Portrait of George Vincent (1796-1832), with landscape background by himself'.jpg|Joseph Clover Portrait of George Vincent, background by Vincent (undated), Norfolk Museums Collections", "*Joseph Clover"]}, {"page": "James Stark (painter)", "response": ["In 1814, following the end of his Norwich apprenticeship, Stark moved to London.

It led to Ladbrooke, Sillett, Joseph Clover, Stannard and Thirtle renting part of the Shakespeare Tavern on Theatre Plain and holding their own exhibition, The Twelfth Exhibition of the Norfolk and Norwich Society of Artists, to rival the original Society's exhibition in Sir Benjamin's Wrench's Court."]}]}}
