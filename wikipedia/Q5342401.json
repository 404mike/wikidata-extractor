It was soon captured, but only after being able to fire at the 61st brigade advance in enfilade. The most severe hold up was due to the condition of the ground, which was '...nothing more than a swampy crater field as far as the final objective', and particularly bad up to the first objective. The first wave of the 6th Ox and Bucks gained the first line at 05:20 with few losses. On the 61st brigade front the 7th K.O.Y.L.I. were fired on from blockhouses in Langemarck and at Langemarck railway station causing heavy losses to the officers, here Private Wilfred Edwards won the Victoria Cross attacking one of the blockhouses, and the first line on this brigade front was reached at 05:40.Inglefield pp.157\u2013160 The advance to the second line began at 05:45, and the second wave of the 6th Ox and Bucks reach the second line soon after. Behind them the 6th K.S.L.I and 12th K.R.R.C., mopping up in the village, came under fire from another blockhouse. Crossing  of open ground Sergeant Edward Cooper subdued the position capturing 46 prisoners and seven machine guns, winning the second Victoria Cross of the day in the division. These two battalions then formed up on the second line. On the left in 61st brigade, the K.O.Y.L.I. was left with only one officer as a company commander, the others being led by sergeants. The 12th King's and 7th D.C.L.I. which had suffered casualties in the mopping up, now formed up in the second line. The advance to the third line began at 07:20 and by 07:45 the 60th brigade reached the final line after opposition from its right flank and the 61st brigade reached the line at 08:00. The division was in contact with both flanking divisions on the final objective, and had taken around 400 prisoners, including a battalion commander, a section of howizers, a 77mm field gun and around 25 machine guns.Inglefield pp. 160\u2013163", "* Major Edward Cooper 12th King's Royal Rifle Corps"]}, {"page": "Edward Cooper", "response": ["Edward Cooper may refer to:", "* Edward Cooper (West Virginia politician) (1873\u20131928), West Virginia congressman", "* Edward Cooper (mayor) (1824\u20131905), mayor of New York City 1879\u20131880", "* Edward Cooper (VC) (1896\u20131985), British recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* Edward Cooper (actor) (1883\u20131956), British actor", "* Edward Cooper (pilot boat), New York pilot boat", "* Edward Cooper, real name of Dancing Harry, featured at Madison Square Garden in the early 1970s for all New York Knicks home games", "* Edward Cooper (British Army officer) (1858\u20131945), commander of the 58th (2/1st London) Division in the First World War"]}, {"page": "Edward Cooper (soldier)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Cooper (VC)"]}, {"page": "List of World War I memorials and cemeteries in Flanders", "response": ["|The memorial, to be found in the village of Langemark, commemorates the actions of 60th and 61st Brigades of the 20th Division on 16 August 1917 when they crossed the Steenbeek and engaged the Germans.
