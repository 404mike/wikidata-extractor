In the case of a hypersurface X of degree d in Pn over a number field, there are good results when d is much smaller than n, often based on the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method. For example, the Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem says that the Hasse principle holds for quadric hypersurfaces over a number field (the case d = 2). Christopher Hooley proved the Hasse principle for smooth cubic hypersurfaces in Pn over Q when n \u2265 8.Hooley (1988), Theorem. In higher dimensions, even more is true: every smooth cubic in Pn over Q has a rational point when n \u2265 9, by Roger Heath-Brown.Heath-Brown (1983), Theorem. More generally, Birch's theorem says that for any odd positive integer d, there is an integer N such that for all n \u2265 N, every hypersurface of degree d in Pn over Q has a rational point."]}, {"page": "David Rodney Heath-Brown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roger Heath-Brown"]}, {"page": "P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)", "response": ["* 2009 Roger Heath-Brown"]}, {"page": "Roger heath-brown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roger Heath-Brown "]}, {"page": "Heath-Brown", "response": ["#redirect Roger Heath-Brown"]}, {"page": "Heath-Brown\u2013Moroz constant", "response": ["The Heath-Brown\u2013Moroz constant C, named for Roger Heath-Brown and Boris Moroz, is defined as"]}]}}
