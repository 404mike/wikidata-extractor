Educated at the University of Edinburgh, he served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Afflicted by tuberculosis, Gillies left the UK aged 28 for South America in the hope that the climate would improve his fragile health. He spent eight years there, mostly in Argentina, surviving wars, civil unrest, and chronic ill health, sending numerous plants to Hooker at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew before returning in 1828. He died aged 42 at Edinburgh on 24 November 1834, his remains interred at Calton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Gillis", "response": ["* John Gillies (minister) (1712\u20131796), Church of Scotland minister and theological writer", "* John Gillies (historian) (1747\u20131836), Scottish historian", "* John Gillies (botanist) (1792\u20131834), Scottish naval surgeon, explorer and botanist", "* John Gillies (New Zealand politician) (1802\u20131871), New Zealand local politician (Otago Provincial Council) and church elder", "* John Gillies (Canadian politician) (1837\u20131889), Ontario farmer and political figure", "* John Gillies (Australian politician) (1844\u20131911), Scottish-born Australian politician", "* John Gillies (footballer) (1918\u20131991), Scottish footballer", "* John Gillies (doctor) (fl. 1970s\u20132010s), Scottish general practitioner", "* John Gillies (artist and musician) (born 1960), Australian artist and musician"]}, {"page": "Gillies", "response": ["* John Gillies (Canadian politician) (1837\u20131889), Scottish-Canadian state and national politician", "* John Gillies (1918\u20131991), Scottish footballer ", "* John Gillies (anaesthetist) (1895-1976) Scottish anaesthetist", "* John Gillies (botanist) (1792\u20131834), Scottish naval surgeon who later became an explorer and botanist", "* John Gillies (minister) (1712\u20131796), a Church of Scotland minister and theological writer", "* John Gillies (historian) (1747\u20131836), Scottish historian and classical scholar"]}, {"page": "Buddleja mendozensis", "response": ["Buddleja mendozensis is an extremely variable species endemic to the xeric and subxeric areas of Argentina, from Jujuy to southern Mendoza and La Pampa, where it grows on rocks at altitudes of 600 \u2013 3,000\u00a0m.Norman, E.
