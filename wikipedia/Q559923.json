Founded by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, her contemporaries at the Academy of Dramatic Art included the actress Meggie Albanesi, Eva Le Gallienne, and Miles Malleson - a senior student who wrote plays for her.

Her teachers included Norman Page, whom she admired and to whose teaching she responded \u2013 \"he gave you confidence, he inspired you with his enthusiasm', and Helen Haye, to whom she did not respond and who was not, according to Drake, a great teacher.Fabia Drake, Blind Fortune, p.24 ", "Back in London in 1921 and unemployed, she spent time with Meggie Albanesi in her dressing room during her 'waits' in Albanesi's current success A Bill of Divorcement at St Martin's Theatre.

She then signed with Vedrenne for 18 months, playing small parts, and understudying and was then sent to Basil Dean who was about to produce James Elroy Flecker's Hassan. This proved a memorable production, incidental music was by Frederick Delius, the great ballet in the House-of-the-Moving-Walls was devised by Fokine, and the cast included  Malcolm Keen as the Caliph and Henry Ainley as Hassan.
