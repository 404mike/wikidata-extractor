The losing side also had Darren Pitcher and Darren Patterson sent off.

After less than three years he was transferred back to Charlton Athletic, alongside David Whyte in exchange for Darren Pitcher. Under the management of former teammate Alan Curbishley, Mortimer often played well in the early part of the season but then suffered hamstring  or back injuries. At the start of the successful promotion winning 1997\u201398 season, against Bradford City he scored a spectacular goal where he turned his full back inside out before a shot to the bottom right of the goal. In this game Charlton won 4\u20131, and it was a performance that hailed of things to come that season. After helping the club into the Premier League in 1998, he again played in the country's top-flight missing a crucial penalty against Leeds United towards the end of the season. He left the following year, moving to lower league side Bristol City where he ended his career in 2001.

With bad blood between fans of the two clubs still boiling over the Cantona incident more than two months earlier, a more serious cloud hung over the replay (also at Villa Park) as a Palace fan had been killed in fighting between fans of the two clubs outside a Walsall public house just before the game. During the first half, Roy Keane suffered ankle injury due to a rash tackle by Palace's Darren Pitcher, and resisted Ferguson's offer to substitute him at half time, when he needed stitches. Just into the second half, Keane's injury was aggravated by another Palace tackle, this time from Gareth Southgate. He reacted by stamping on Southgate and earned himself a red card. Keane was then attacked by Palace's Darren Patterson, who was also sent off. It seemed likely that Keane would miss the rest of the season and the FA Cup final (which United reached by winning the semi final replay 2\u20130) but ultimately he was back in action for the final, having already served his three-match ban for bringing the game into disrepute."]}, {"page": "1996 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["|RWB ||7||Darren Pitcher"]}, {"page": "South London derby", "response": ["* Darren Pitcher"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["|Darren Pitcher"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 in English football", "response": ["* 26 November 2018: Darren Pitcher, 49, Charlton Athletic and Crystal Palace midfielder."]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Darren Pitcher, 49, English footballer (Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2018", "response": ["*Darren Pitcher, 49, English footballer (Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace).Former Charlton midfielder Darren Pitcher dies aged 49"]}, {"page": "Pitcher (surname)", "response": ["*Darren Pitcher (1969\u20132018), English former professional footballer"]}]}}
