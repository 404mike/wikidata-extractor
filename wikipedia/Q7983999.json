In 1844 he became editor of The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary, and continued in this role until 1865. A problem he published in The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary was the inspiration for Thomas Kirkman to publish his first mathematical work, on Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, beginning the mathematical study of combinatorial designs.His book, Essays on Musical Intervals, Harmonics, and the Temperament of the Musical Scale, advocated 19-tone equal temperament and used a division of the octave into 730 parts, now designated as Woolhouse units, for measuring musical intervals.\nHe is credited with a formula for numerical integration.In 1848 he was a co-founder of the Institute of Actuaries.\nHe died on 12 August 1893.His daughter, Emma Mary (Woolhouse) Rea, married musician Dr. William Rea of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.", "link_mentions": {}}}
