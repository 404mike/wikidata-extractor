He went on to become the first secretary of the Collingwood Football Club  and also the first secretary of the Victorian Football League when the VFL was established in 1897. He held the position of secretary of the VFL for thirty-four years from 1897 to 1929.\nIn 1930, the E. L. Wilson Shield was created to be awarded to each year's premiership winning team.
