He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. He made his Derbyshire first team debut in 2006, having spent two years in the second team.\nHaving first appeared (and finished not-out) in a Second XI Trophy match, marred by a 12-run penalty award to Derbyshire which handed them a match victory by one wicket, he later appeared in his debut first-team match against Essex, a match which he played on the same day as he was supposed to be receiving his A-level results.\nAn off-spinner, he has proven slightly expensive in his rookie season, though this is perhaps to be expected from such a young character.\nJake has recently been given a new two-year contract, seeing him stay at the county until at least 2010.\nIn October 2007, Needham traveled to Victoria, Australia, where he has accepted a one-season contract to play for club cricket side St. Mary's during the English Winter.\nIn May 2012, he retired from professional cricket after asking to be released from the final year of his contract with Derbyshire. The county have accepted his request, ending Needham's six-year stay.\nHe is still involved in club cricket at the highest level however and has been appointed captain of Ockbrook and Borrowash, who play in the Derbyshire Premier League in place of Kevin Dean, another Ex-Derbyshire player.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Essex County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["After run rates of just above 2.5 on the first two days, the third day gave the spectators nearly 400 runs while eighteen wickets fell.
