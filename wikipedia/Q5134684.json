The team's first recruit was the Englishman Clive Toye, a former sportswriter who had moved to the United States in 1967 to become general manager of the short-lived Baltimore Bays; he was given the same post in New York. Toye sought to convey the new team's ambitions within its name, and reasoned that he could outdo the \"Metropolitans\" label referenced by the then-nine-year-old New York Mets baseball team by calling his team the \"Cosmos\", shortened from \"Cosmopolitans\". However, the owners preferred other possible names: the Erteguns wished to use the name originally suggested by Nesuhi, the \"New York Blues\"; and another part of the ownership group wanted to adopt the name \"New York Lovers\". Toye then staged a rigged \"name the team\" contest, receiving 3,000 entries and selecting one that just happened to match his pre-determined winner. Two NYC teachers, Meyer Diller and Al Capelli, from Martin Van Buren High School in Queens, entered the contest and submitted the name \"Cosmos\". The two physical education teachers had independently used Toye's method of deriving it from \"cosmopolitan\". The two men were awarded a trip to Europe as a prize. The team name was officially unveiled on February 4, 1971.Newsham (2006). p. 22.", "For the team's initial uniform Cosmos general manager Clive Toye chose the green and yellow of the Brazilian national team as part of his strategy to lure Pel\u00e9, one of that country's star players, to the United States.Toye (2006). p. 49. The club's initial uniform was all green with yellow trim, with the colors reversed on the road uniform. Coincidentally, the colors were the same as those of the previous New York NASL team, the New York Generals, which had folded after the 1968 season. When Pel\u00e9 did come on board in 1975, the uniform was changed to all-white in imitation of his club in Brazil, Santos FC. The green and yellow elements were relegated to the trim. The green shirt was concurrently matched with white shorts to become the new away uniform. Uniforms designed by Ralph Lauren were used from 1979 to the end; the home uniform remained all-white, though with navy and yellow trim replacing the green and white trim of the previous outfit. The away uniform became navy shirts and shorts with yellow trim, paired with unusual yellow-and-navy hooped socks, which were later replaced with plain navy blue ones."]}, {"page": "Chicago Sting", "response": ["1978: At the beginning of the 1978 NASL season the Sting set a much unwanted record when the team lost its first ten matches.

Toye had been one of the men behind the success of the NASL's leading light the New York Cosmos, while Musgrove, a former left-winger with West Ham United was a coach with a growing reputation.", "The Blizzard, who were now being run by former Sting President Clive Toye, were one of the franchises fighting to keep the NASL afloat. Though it was a battle, Chicago took game one of the series at Comiskey Park, 2\u20131 on a late goal by Manny Rojas. This gave the Roy's Sting the unique opportunity to earn a second league title in the same city as their first. This time they would be playing at the more intimate Varsity Stadium instead of Exhibition Stadium, the site of the Soccer Bowl '81 triumph. After 68 minutes Chicago had built a 2\u20130 lead on goals by Mark Simanton and Pato Margetic. Toronto stormed back by scoring two goals in a 1:30 span to level the match in the 73rd minute. With 8:27 remaining in regulation Margetic notched his 6th goal of the playoffs off a pass from Rojas. Chicago goalkeeper Victor Nogueira was impressive in both matches, especially in the final minutes and the Sting held on to win their second title in four years. Margetic, with three of Chicago's five goals, was named the MVP of the finals.", "* United States: Rudy Getzinger, Karl-Heinz Granitza, Willy Roy, Lee Stern, Clive Toye, Bruce Wilson"]}]}}
