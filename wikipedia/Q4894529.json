He applied for the vacant management positions at Lincoln City and Rotherham United, but was rejected.

He was made assistant manager at Port Vale under Bobby Smith in November 1977. After Smith's departure to Swindon Town, he became manager for the 1978\u201379 season. The \"Valiants\" finished 16th in the Fourth Division and later he left by mutual consent in August 1979. He had signed popular player Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000, however most of his big money signings had torrid times at Vale Park. He signed right-back Neil Wilkinson (free), Ken Todd (a club-record \u00a337,000 signing despite only having made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers), Gerry Keenan (\u00a315,000), Felix Healy (\u00a38,000), Kevin Tully (\u00a33,000 plus Neil Wilkinson), Andy Proudlove (\u00a31,000), Peter Farrell (breaking the club-record again at \u00a340,000), and Bob Delgado (\u00a330,000). To finance these signings, he sold John Froggatt (\u00a38,000), Mick Moore (\u00a32,000), Terry Bailey (\u00a32,000), Ken Beamish (\u00a335,000), and John Ridley (\u00a355,000).
