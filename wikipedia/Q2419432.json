He also won twelve caps for Scotland during his 18-year playing career. He participated at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\nWhyte joined Celtic on 14 May 1985 as a 16-year-old from the Celtic Boys Club. A defender with the greatest of promise, described as the new Billy McNeill, his form slumped towards the end of his time at the club. He left at the end of the 1991\u201392 season when an agreeable new contract was not forthcoming. He was sold to Middlesbrough for \u00a3900,000 where he returned to the early good form he had shown at Celtic.\nAfter 5 seasons on Teesside, Whyte left Middlesbrough to return to Scotland, joining Aberdeen for an undisclosed fee and a four and a half-year contract in December 1997. He was appointed team captain at Pittodrie and remained there until 2002, when he joined Partick Thistle on a free transfer.\nAlong with Gerry Britton, Whyte was appointed joint player-manager of the Jags after Gerry Collins was sacked in November 2003. In March 2004 he decided to hang up his playing boots to concentrate on management. Whyte and Britton were sacked by Thistle in December 2004. Soon afterwards he moved to the United Arab Emirates. He is now a pundit on ShowSports, the sports channel on the Showtime Arabia network, based in Dubai, and writes a weekly column for the UAE's leading daily newspaper 7DAYS.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Partick Thistle F.C.", "response": ["Following Lambie's retirement at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, Thistle struggled. Gerry Collins (Lambie's previous assistant) was sacked mid-season and replaced with joint player-managers Derek Whyte and Gerry Britton. This change was not enough to revive the team, and Thistle were relegated at the end of the 2003\u201304 season after Inverness, having won the First Division title, were permitted to groundshare with Aberdeen. In season 2004\u201305 the team continued to struggle and Whyte and Britton were dismissed mid-season. Dick Campbell, their successor, was unable to avoid relegation to the Second Division. He did return the club to the First Division the following season, through the newly introduced play-off system, having finished 4th in the league. This brought to a close the club's most unpredictable decade, in footballing terms at least: between 1996 and 2006 Thistle had been promoted three times and relegated four times. They were the second team in Scottish football to be relegated from the top flight through successive subsequent relegations, excluding those caused by league reconstruction, after St. Johnstone in the 1980s.", "|Derek Whyte"]}, {"page": "Whyte (surname)", "response": ["* Derek Whyte, Scottish footballer (Celtic FC, Middlesbrough FC, Aberdeen FC and Partick Thistle FC)"]}, {"page": "John Lambie (footballer, born 1941)", "response": ["In January 2003, Lambie announced that he would retire at the end of the season as he did not agree with new regulations in football; he had attempted to sign Nathan Lowndes and Steven Ferguson on loan from English clubs but was barred by FIFA as they had both recently played in Scotland for other teams. On 17 May 2003 he made his farewell in his last game at Firhill Stadium, a 1\u20130 loss to Dundee United, having already guaranteed survival in the SPL on a considerably lower budget than their competitors. He became a member of the club's board. In 2004, Lambie returned as manager for a fourth spell, this time as Caretaker, briefly around the end of 2004 and beginning of 2005, in a bid to help the team's struggles on the pitch under the new management foil of Derek Whyte and Gerry Britton, who were later dismissed from their roles, as Dick Campbell took over reign at Firhill."]}, {"page": "Jorge Cadete", "response": ["Cadete's return to the public eye in Scotland prompted rookie co-managers Gerry Britton and Derek Whyte to take a gamble on the striker. He signed a short-term contract for top division relegation battlers Partick Thistle in late January 2004, ending his 18-month exile from the game; the move was controversial however, as he had already agreed to sign for Raith Rovers, even being photographed in the team shirt by the media."]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)", "response": ["Brady made several more personnel changes to the Celtic side for 1992\u201393, selling defenders Derek Whyte and Chris Morris whilst bringing in forwards Stuart Slater (for a then record fee of \u00a31.5m) and Andy Payton from England, and right-back Rudi Vata, the first Albanian to play in British football.  Celtic's domestic form proved to be no better than the previous season, losing 1\u20130 to Aberdeen in the semi-final of the League Cup, a disappointing 2\u20130 defeat at Falkirk in the Scottish Cup, and a fourth-place finish in the league.  Europe provided a brief respite for Brady, Celtic recovering from a 2\u20130 first leg defeat away at Cologne in the UEFA Cup to win the return match in Glasgow 3\u20130, midfielder John Collins scoring the decisive third goal seven minutes from time. Collins had been signed from Hibernian by Billy McNeill in the summer of 1990, but after a mediocre first season became one of the few players to genuinely flourish during Liam Brady's tenure as manager."]}]}}
