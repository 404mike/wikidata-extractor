That first telegraph line in Australia ran from Melbourne to Williamstown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Todd (pioneer)", "response": ["His first commission was to erect a telegraph line between Adelaide city centre and Port Adelaide. Such a line had been mooted some years before, and impatient with the lack of action and seeing its commercial possibilities, James Macgeorge installed one privately, cleverly avoiding obstacles put in his way by the government, and had it operating in 1855. Todd's line, more direct and technically superior (and far more expensive) was opened in February 1856, and in June of that year he recommended that a line between Adelaide and Melbourne should be constructed. Todd personally rode over much of the country through which the line would have to pass. Todd and Samuel Walker McGowan, his counterpart in Victoria, proceeded to link the two colonies' telegraph systems near Mount Gambier in July 1858."]}, {"page": "John B\u00e9chervaise", "response": ["His paternal great-grandfather William Philip B\u00e9chervaise (b. 1831, d. 1907) was born in Hampshire and was amongst the tens of thousands who travelled to Victoria in the 1850s in search of gold, but then decided to remain. He was the first of that surname to arrive in Australia. He was nearby to the Eureka Stockade and professed to having been \"bunted\" by a trooper. Appointed to the Victorian Posts and Telegraphs Department in 1856, he was soon promoted as Telegraph Master at Ballarat in 1858, later combining the role as Postmaster. He remained with the Department in Ballarat till retirement in 1892, excepting for two years when he was transferred to Melbourne to reorganise that office. One of Australia's earliest telephone and telephony experimenters in 1878. As a member of the Telegraph Electrical Society of Victoria from inception in 1874, he was a contemporary of Samuel Walker McGowan, Peter Robert Challen and Henry Sutton.

The telegraph lines were rapidly extended to cover the entire colony and the other colonies also established their own networks and interconnected the colonies. Australia became part of the world telegraph network in 1872 when a submarine cable was completed connecting Darwin, Australia with Britain via Java in the Dutch East Indies. An Overland Telegraph line was constructed to connect Darwin with other major cities in Australia.", "The Industrial and Technological Museum in Melbourne ran a telegraphy course in 1870=1880 that became so popular with women that a separate class for men was introduced. Initially the syllabus was limited to becoming proficient in operation of the morse key, but at the instigation of Samuel Walker McGowan, Superintendent of Telegraphs, the classes were expanded to include all aspects of the theory of electric telegraphy and maintenance of a typical telegraph station. Many of those that passed the examination were appointed to the Telegraph Department. During their three-month probationary period, they were supervised by Miss Green, said to be \"one of the most skilful lady operators in the colony.\""]}]}}
