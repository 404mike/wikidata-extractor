He made his debut the following day in the 0\u20130 draw against Mansfield Town, he came on for Craig Farrell after 61 minutes and almost scored with his first touch, but his effort was well saved by Mansfield goalkeeper Alan Marriott. On 26 November, he came off the bench in the 1\u20130 win against Barrow, replacing Sean Newton after 68 minutes and scoring his first goal for the club. He headed in a Richard Davies cross on 76 minutes to give The Bucks their first league win in 9 outings. He made his first start for the club in the 1\u20131 draw against Luton Town three days later. Jones scored in the 2\u20132 draw with Stockport County on 24 January 2012. In the 0\u20130 draw with Alfreton Town on 3 March, Jones suffered a knee ligament injury that would keep him out of action for up to six weeks. He made his return from injury on 17 April, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute in the 1\u20130 win against Tamworth. The win secured Telford's place in the Conference National for the following season. On 4 May, it was announced on Telford's website that Jones had agreed terms to a contract extension with the club."]}, {"page": "Chris Beardsley", "response": ["Beardsley was signed by Conference Premier club York City on 19 June 2007, to provide competition for Richard Brodie, Craig Farrell and Onome Sodje. He made his debut as a starter in their 2\u20131 home defeat to Cambridge on 11 August 2007, in which he was substituted on 62 minutes. Despite struggling for a place in the team, Beardsley turned down a loan move to Conference North club Tamworth in September 2007, in order to prove his worth at York. He suffered a broken jaw in two places during York's 2\u20130 away win over Grays Athletic on 22 September 2007, after being elbowed by Jamie Stuart in an off-the-ball incident, which was likely to rule Beardsley out for at least three months. Essex Police confirmed they were making enquiries following the incident. Beardsley returned to the team as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 1\u20131 home draw with Crawley Town on 1 December 2007. He finished his York career with nine appearances."]}, {"page": "Peter Holmes (footballer)", "response": ["After making only one appearance during 2008\u201309, he joined York City in the Conference Premier on 22 September 2008 on a one-month loan and made his debut a day later in a 2\u20130 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers. He scored for the team in the following match with a six-yard shot from a Craig Farrell pass, which finished as a 3\u20133 draw with Stevenage Borough. He suffered from a hip injury, which resulted him in missing York's 3\u20131 defeat against Wrexham. His final match for York was a 2\u20130 victory against Rushden & Diamonds and he finished the loan spell with five appearances and one goal, before returning to Rotherham on 18 October 2008 after being recalled by the club. Weeks after returning to Rotherham, it was suggested that Holmes might be loaned out again after failing to break back into the team. It was over a month before Holmes eventually made his first appearance for Rotherham since returning, after starting in the 2\u20130 defeat at home to Bradford City on 21 November 2008."]}, {"page": "Adam Smith (footballer, born February 1985)", "response": ["Smith was released by Chesterfield after he was not offered a new contract at the end of 2007\u201308.

He then had a trial with newly relegated Conference Premier club Wrexham and eventually signed a contract with Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in late August. Smith made a goalscoring debut for Gainsborough with the team's goal in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Vauxhall Motors on 30 August. He joined York City in the Conference Premier on loan on 27 November, becoming Martin Foyle's first signing as manager, in a deal that would expire on 6 January 2009. Smith made his debut after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Craig Farrell in a 1\u20131 draw with Salisbury City. His first goal came after scoring the opener for York with a close range finish in a 3\u20131 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following this, Foyle stated his intention of extending Smith's loan at York. Smith said he was looking to join the club on a permanent contract and that Gainsborough manager Steve Charles would allow him to leave for a club in a higher division on a free transfer. However, a move to York stalled in January as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee, although Foyle refused to pay this.
