Five changes were made for the trip to Rochdale, but a stoppage time goal from former Valiant Calvin Andrew condemned Vale to a sixth successive defeat. The run of defeats was ended with a 0\u20130 draw at home to third-place Milton Keynes Dons. Richard Duffy then scored the first goal of his Vale career against Scunthorpe and secured a draw that took the club over the 50 point mark; however a Kyle Wootton goal five minutes into stoppage time denied Vale the victory. Second-place Preston twice took the lead against Vale, but despite Duffy being sent off Vale came back with two Michael O'Connor penalties to claim an important point. Vale secured their League One status with 2\u20131 win at bottom-club Yeovil, ending a run of nine games without a win. This left the final game against Fleetwood as a formality, as Vale fell to a 2\u20131 defeat."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|29||Kyle Wootton||CF||||Epworth||||12||1||Academy||1 July 2014||Trainee||2015", "|29||FW|| Kyle Wootton                                               ||1||0||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|29||Kyle Wootton||CF||||Epworth||||24||2||Academy||1 July 2014||Free||2016", "|29||FW|| Kyle Wootton    ||1||0||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|29||Kyle Wootton||CF||||Epworth||||41||5||Academy||1 August 2014||Trainee||2017", "|29||||CF||Kyle Wootton                               ||1||0||0||0||1", "| 30 September 2016 || CF ||  || Kyle Wootton || North Ferriby United || 24 January 2017 || ", "| 25 January 2017 || CF ||  || Kyle Wootton || Cheltenham Town || End of Season || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Cheltenham Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 25 January 2017 || CF ||  || Kyle Wootton || Scunthorpe United || End of Season || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2017 || CF ||  || Kyle Wootton || Scunthorpe United || January 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|29||Kyle Wootton||CF||||Epworth||||43||5||Academy||1 August 2014||Trainee||2018", "| 31 August 2017 || CF ||  || Kyle Wootton || Stevenage || January 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|29||Kyle Wootton||CF||||Epworth||||73||11||Academy||1 August 2014||Trainee||2021", "|29||||CF||Kyle Wootton                             ||6||0||0||0||6", "|29||||CF||Kyle Wootton                             ||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0||0 ", "| 29 September 2018 || CF ||  || Kyle Wootton || FC Halifax Town || November 2018 || "]}, {"page": "Connell Rawlinson", "response": ["Rawlinson signed for newly-relegated National League club Notts County on 5 August 2019.
