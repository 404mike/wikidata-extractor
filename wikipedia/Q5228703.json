White's worth to the team could be calculated in terms of goals scored (between 1959 and the conclusion of the Double winning season (a season in which he was ever-present) he contributed 18 goals) but his success mainly lay in a combination of skills: his passing, his ball control which helped sustain the attacking momentum but so too his runs to find space off the ball, arriving unexpectedly in the opposition's penalty area which resulted in the White Hart Lane faithful giving him the nickname \"The Ghost\"."]}, {"page": "David Dunmore", "response": ["#redirect Dave Dunmore"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Dave Dunmore"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Graham (footballer)", "response": ["At Orient, Graham was part of the team that gained promotion to the First Division in 1961\u201362, scoring both goals in the 2\u20130 win over Bury that sent them up on the last day of the season.
