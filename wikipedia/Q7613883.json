Following defeat by Manchester City at the beginning of December with Ipswich bottom of the league and relegation already looking more than likely, Lyall quit. Coach Paul Goddard stepped in as caretaker manager but former player George Burley was soon back at the club as manager, with Dale Roberts as his assistant. But the transition did little to alter Ipswich's fortunes. Before then though, in arguably their biggest highlight of the season, the Tractor Boys stunned reigning champions Manchester United by beating them 3\u20132 at Portman Road in September (having even led by 2\u20130 at one stage) which would ultimately be one of the defeats that cost United the title by one point. However, in the return fixture, an unthinkable double wasn't to be and a 9\u20130 humiliation at the hands of United at Old Trafford in early March, a record Premier League defeat, effectively crushed any remaining hopes of survival. The defeat was part of a run of seven defeats with Ipswich failing to score and their relegation was guaranteed on 14 April with six games remaining following results elsewhere.
