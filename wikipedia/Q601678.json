Making the Tigers starting XV was difficult however, as internationals Neil Back and Martin Corry took two of the three starting positions, with Paul Gustard and Will Johnson (younger brother of Martin) fighting for the remaining place."]}, {"page": "Youngs", "response": ["*Ben Youngs (b. 1989), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Danny Care", "response": ["In Australia Care started the 1st Test against Australia in Perth which Australia won 27\u201317. England's poor performance in the game attracted significant criticism and Care was replaced by Ben Youngs for the 2nd Test one week later in Sydney. England narrowly won the 2nd Test 21\u201320 to tie the Test series 1 game all with Care coming off the bench after 66 minutes with England just 1 point ahead to help guide the team to a famous victory, only the 3rd time England had beaten Australia in Australia.", "During the Autumn internationals in November 2010 Care found himself on the replacements bench for all 4 games with Ben Youngs taking the starting position. England lost the opening game to New Zealand 26\u201316 before wins against Australia by 35\u201318 and against Samoa 26\u201313. The final game of the series against South Africa saw England lose 21\u201311. Care made second-half appearances in all 4 games and the South Africa game saw him reach the landmark of 25 caps at the age of just 23. He made significant contributions in all 4 games including an \"assist\" for a late try by Tom Croft which clinched the victory against Samoa. Care's club Director of Rugby at Harlequins, Conor O'Shea, commented \"When Danny came off the bench in the Autumn Internationals he was outstanding. Hopefully he will keep getting better and better\". In January 2011 Care was named in the revised England Elite Player Squad for the 2011 RBS 6 Nations series.", "Care was again on the England bench throughout the 2011 RBS 6 Nations with Ben Youngs starting at scrum-half alongside Toby Flood at fly-half in all 5 games. In the opening game against Wales in Cardiff, Care and Jonny Wilkinson were brought on in the 2nd half to replace Youngs and Flood to close out a narrow 26\u201319 victory. A week later at Twickenham against Italy, Care and Wilkinson were again brought on midway through the 2nd half to replace Youngs and Flood but this time in different circumstances as England won comfortably 59\u201313 with Care scoring one of England's eight tries on the day shortly after coming onto the pitch. In Round 3 of the championship England beat France 17\u20139 at Twickenham with Care and Wilkinson coming on in the 2nd half to help steer England to victory. In Round 4 against Scotland at Twickenham Care and Wilkinson again replaced Youngs and Flood in the 2nd half to help protect a narrow lead with England eventually winning 22\u201316. A week later England travelled to Dublin to play Ireland in Round 5 knowing that a win would give them the Championship and a Grand Slam. Care was again on the bench but was on the pitch as early as the 46th minute to replace Ben Youngs who had earlier been sin-binned. England were well beaten 24\u20138 but won the 2011 RBS 6 Nations Championship as nearest rivals Wales were beaten by France in Paris.", "England's home-and-away Rugby World Cup \"warm up\" games against Wales in August gave Care the chance to press his claims for a place in the final 30-man squad to travel to New Zealand as well as an opportunity to re-claim the starting jersey in the absence of Ben Youngs who was recovering from knee surgery. In the opening game at Twickenham Care was partnered by Jonny Wilkinson at fly-half as England won 23\u201319. Paul Ackford of the Sunday Telegraph said Care was \"part of a fine half-back pairing\". Care received widespread praise, especially in Wales, for his sportsmanship during the game in refusing to play the ball at the base of a ruck when it was clear that Welsh full-back Morgan Stoddart was badly injured following a tackle. Referee Steve Walsh was forced to stop the game to allow Stoddart to be treated for what turned out to be a double fracture of tibia and fibia. For the return game in Cardiff a week later Wilkinson was rested in favour of Toby Flood and Care was on the replacements' bench with Richard Wigglesworth starting. Care was on the field as early as the 29th minute when Wigglesworth suffered a head injury. England lost 19\u20139 but Stephen Jones of the Sunday Times, a longtime critic of Care, said \"Danny Care made a significant impact and was probably England's best player\". Unfortunately Care sustained a torn plantar plate affecting the big toe of his left foot during the game, an injury which required surgery and which kept him out of England's squad for the World Cup. The medical reports confirming that surgery was required came just a few hours after Care had been informed by England Head Coach Martin Johnson that he would be included in the squad.", "Despite winning 5 out of 6 group games in the Heineken Cup, Harlequins failed to qualify for the quarter-finals and dropped down to the Amlin Challenge Cup which gave them the opportunity to defend the trophy they had won the previous season. Harlequins lost 37\u20138 away to RC Toulon (France) in the Amlin Challenge Cup quarter-final, Care scored Harlequins only try late in the game. Care's excellent end of season form earned him a recall to the England senior squad for the summer tour to South Africa. Care was overlooked for the first Test against South Africa in Durban with Ben Youngs starting and Lee Dickson on the bench, England lost 22\u201317. However, Care started the first mid-week game of the tour in the \"non-cap\" game against South African Barbarians South in Kimberley. England won 54\u201326 with Care scoring one of England's 8 tries late in the second-half. Care was again overlooked in favour of Youngs & Dickson for the second Test in Johannesburg, England lost 36\u201327. Youngs injured his shoulder in Johannesburg, an injury which caused him to return home for surgery. This opened the way for Care to be recalled to the starting XV for the third and final Test in Port Elizabeth with Dickson on the bench. A much improved performance saw England draw 14\u201314 which meant South Africa won the series 2\u20130 with 1 game drawn. Care scored England's only try early in the first half and was named man of the match.", "Care's man of the match performance against South Africa in the final match of the summer tour meant that he retained the starting shirt for the opening game of the Autumn Internationals against Fiji. England won comfortably 54\u201312 despite Care being sin-binned midway through the first half for a tip-tackle on Leone Nakarawa. Care started the game the following week against Australia but England produced a disappointing performance and lost 20\u201314. There were 6 changes for the next game against South Africa with Care moving to the bench and Ben Youngs taking the starting shirt, England lost narrowly 16\u201315. Care remained on the bench for the final game of the series against reigning world champions New Zealand. England beat New Zealand 38\u201321, their first win over the All Blacks in 9 years and only their seventh victory in the history of the fixture. Care made significant contributions off the bench in the second half of both the South Africa & New Zealand games.", "Ben Youngs retained the starting shirt for the opening game of the 2013 RBS 6 Nations championship against Scotland at Twickenham. England won 38\u201318 with Care coming off the bench in the second half to score England's fourth try in the final minute of the game. Care remained on the bench for the Round 2 fixture against Ireland in Dublin the following week. England won a tight game 12\u20136 and Care did not get onto the field, the first time in his England career that he had been an unused replacement. In Round 3, 2 weeks later, Care came off the bench in the second half to guide England to a narrow 23\u201313 victory against France at Twickenham. Care was given the opportunity to start in the Round 4 game against Italy at Twickenham but despite winning 18\u201311 the England performance was disappointing. Care was back on the bench for the championship decider against Wales in Cardiff in the final game of the tournament. England had the opportunity to clinch the championship and a Grand Slam but Wales won comfortably 30\u20133, England's biggest ever defeat in the fixture, and they had to settle for the runners-up position.", "Care failed to be selected for the 2013 British and Irish Lions squad to tour Australia. Greg Growden, writing for ESPN Scrum.com in Australia, said, \"Danny Care's chances of making the tour were always going to be hard after spending most of the Six Nations series on the England bench, acting as Ben Youngs' back-up.\""]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Premiership Rugby", "response": ["|SH ||20|| Ben Youngs||"]}, {"page": "Toby Flood", "response": ["After acting as a substitute in the first two games of the 2009 Six Nations, Flood started the away game against , and held onto the fly-half jersey for the remaining two wins against France and Scotland. His achilles injury saw him lose it to former clubmate Jonny Wilkinson for the 2009 autumn internationals, but he started the first 2010 Six Nations game against Wales at inside centre, due to an injury to Riki Flutey. He finished the Six Nations once more in possession of the England 10 shirt during the game against France, and retained it for the  summer tour. Although England lost the first game, Flood was able to link up with his club colleague Ben Youngs in a strong half-back pairing in the second. A much improved performance saw England beat Australia 20\u201321."]}]}}
