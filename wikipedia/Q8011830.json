His uncle was E.H. Baily, a sculptor.  William Hellier Baily was born at Bristol on 7 July 1819.From 1837 to 1844 he was Assistant Curator in the Bristol Museum, a post he relinquished to join the staff of the British Geological Survey in London. In 1854 he became assistant naturalist, under Edward Forbes and afterwards under Huxley. In 1857 he was transferred to the Irish branch of the Geological Survey, as acting palaeontologist, and retained this post until the end of his life.\n\nHe was the author of many papers on palaeontological subjects, and of notes on fossils in the explanatory memoirs of the Geological Survey of Ireland. He published (1867\u20131875) a useful work entitled Figures of Characteristic British Fossils, with Descriptive Remarks, of which only the first volume, dealing with palaeozoic species, was issued. The figures were all drawn on stone by himself. He died at Rathmines near Dublin on 6 August 1888.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Hodges Baily", "response": ["His nephew was William Hellier Baily, the paleontologist.

Kjellesvig-Waering in 1964 as part of a greater re-examination of the various species assigned to the family Pterygotidae. Kjellesvig-Waering retained P. dicki as part of Pterygotus. Scottish paleontologists Lyall I. Anderson and Nigel H. Trewin and German paleontologist Jason A. Dunlop noted in 2000 that Kjellesvig-Waerings acception of the original designation for Pterygotus dicki was \"burdensome\" as it is based on highly fragmentary material. They noted that like many other pterygotid species, P. dicki represented yet another name applied to some scattered segments, a practice they deemed \"taxonomically unsound\". Though they suggested that further research was required to determine whether or not the taxon was valid at all, they did note that the presence of a fringe to the segments formed by their ornamentation was absent in all other species of Pterygotus, but \"strikingly similar\" to what was present in Cyrtoctenus. Subsequent research treated P. dicki as a species of Cyrtoctenus."]}, {"page": "William Bailey", "response": ["*William Hellier Baily, English palaeontologist"]}, {"page": "Baily (surname)", "response": ["*William Hellier Baily (1819\u20131888), English palaeontologist"]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* William Hellier Baily (England, 1819-1888)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Carte", "response": ["Apart from his museum work, Carte sat on the council of the RCSI for many years, and was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Linnean Society, and the Imperial Botanical and Zoological Society, Vienna.
