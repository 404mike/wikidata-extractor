It was in The Yummy Fur that Thomson would meet Alex Kapranos. When The Yummy Fur broke up, Thomson had various odd jobs DJing and working as a nude model at the Glasgow School of Art. He is also the drummer in the Glasgow band Amor, with Luke Fowler, Richard Youngs and Michael Francis Duch. \nIn 2001 Thomson joined Franz Ferdinand, originally playing guitar.  He later switched to drums.  He also does backing vocals, and sang lead on the German version of \"Tell Her Tonight\" from B-side of the \"Michael\" single. The English version is from Franz Ferdinand.\nHis record label, NEW! (which started in 2005), only releases material on vinyl records.\nThomson resided in Glasgow, with his now ex-wife Esther (DJ and lead singer of Cash Machine). Together they DJ'd as Polyester (Paul and Esther). They had a baby boy named Georgie in July 2006, and on 19 September 2008 (while Franz Ferdinand were supposed to be headlining a concert) they had another boy and named him Ronnie. Because of Thomson's absence, Franz Ferdinand played a semi-acoustic set and swapped the headlining spot with The Ting Tings. Thomson also has a show on Subcity Radio called \"they're only records paul\" which runs fortnightly on Thursdays.On 12 June 2008, it was announced that Thomson was now endorsing Highwood Drums, a UK custom company becoming a Highwood artist.Thomson is reported to choreograph many of the Franz Ferdinand's videos, including \"Do You Want To\" and \"The Dark of the Matinee\", having tap-danced and performed as the Artful Dodger in a West End production of Oliver! as a child.
