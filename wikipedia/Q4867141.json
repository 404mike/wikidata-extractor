In retirement, he continued his connection with the army, serving as Colonel of his former regiment, and assisting in writing the British official history of the Korean War.

By April 1951, the brigade consisted of four infantry battalions, one Australian, one Canadian and two British, including: the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment; 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry; 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment and 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Brigadier Basil Coad had departed for Hong Kong on compassionate leave on 23 March and the brigade was now under the command of Brigadier Brian Burke.O'Neill 1985, p. 123.

A new attack was planned for 6 August, with 130 Brigade making a feint to the north, while 129 Brigade continued from the west. During the day 130 Bde made substantial progress, diverting German defenders from the main thrust. It continued next day, while the dominating position of Mont Pin\u00e7on fell to a surprise attack, by 129 Bde and its supporting tanks.Buckley, pp. 167\u20138.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 409\u201310.Essame, pp. 67\u201372.Hunt, pp. 93\u2013130, 139\u201344.

However, the divisional commander, Maj-Gen Ivor Thomas, considered that Brig Leslie was dilatory in attacking on 13 August and sacked him.

On 5 October 43rd (W) handed most of its positions over to the US 101st Airborne Division, but 5th Dorsets had difficulty extricating themselves from their exposed positions round Driel. The battalion left its anti-tank and mortar platoons to help the Americans and fighting continued for another day before the offensive ended. 130 Brigade then relieved the US 82nd Airborne Division on the Groesbeek heights that it had  captured during Market Garden. As 43rd (W) Division settled down to hold this static line during the autumn, it rotated its brigades every seven days.Essame, pp. 144\u20137, 151\u20132.

There it joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade, a garrison formation hurriedly committed from Hong Kong by the British as the situation deteriorated around the Pusan Perimeter in late August to bolster the US Eighth Army under the command of Lieutenant General Walton Walker.. Commanded by Brigadier Basil Coad, the brigade was renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and consisted of the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment (1 ASHR), the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (1 MR) and 3 RAR. The two understrength British battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks, while the brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment, and had no integral artillery or armour support, for which it would rely entirely on the Americans until the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived in January 1951. As such, with a strength of nearly 1,000 men, the addition of 3 RAR gave the brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing the Australians to work within a familiar organisational environment, rather than being attached to a US formation.. Also under the command of the brigade were a number of US Army units, including 155\u00a0mm howitzers from the US 90th Field Artillery Battalion, M4 Sherman tanks from the US 89th Tank Battalion and a company of US combat engineers.."]}, {"page": "Basil Aubrey Coad", "response": ["#REDIRECT Basil Coad"]}, {"page": "Charles Green (Australian soldier)", "response": ["When the Australian government committed 3 RAR, Army Headquarters determined that it would be led by an officer who had served in World War II and had a distinguished record.

He left Australia for Japan on 8 September, and took over command of 3 RAR on 12 September. He oversaw another two weeks of unit training in Japan, then flew to South Korea on 25 September to await the battalion's arrival. 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September.

Green's battalion joined Brigadier Basil Coad's 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, part of the force under the Commander-in-Chief United Nations Command,  General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. On 5 October, the entire brigade was airlifted by the United States Air Force (USAF) from Taegu to Kimpo Air Base outside Seoul, their vehicles driving the intervening  and only arriving in Seoul on 9 October.
