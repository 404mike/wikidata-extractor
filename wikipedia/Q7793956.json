Though her date of birth is often cited at 1845. She was the eldest daughter of Catherine Isabella Osborne and Ralph Bernal Osborne, who took his wife's surname following their marriage in 1844. The Osbornes appear to have become estranged early in their marriage, with her father living in London, seeing Edith and her Grace raised by her mother alone. Mrs Osbourne was a talented artist, and encouraged both her daughters to take up artistic pursuits. Artists often stayed at Newtown Anner, including Thomas Shotter Boys and Alexandre Calame, and it is possible the sisters received tuition from them. Edith developed an interest in botany around this time, corresponding over the years with Newtown Anner's garden designer Joseph Paxton. Fanny Currey was a frequent visitor to the house, with the pair collaborating on illustrating envelopes from 1858 to 1868."]}, {"page": "Catherine Isabella Osborne", "response": ["Osborne was noted for keeping an entertaining, lively and cultivated house, playing host to artists such as Thomas Shotter Boys and Alexandre Calame. Boys exhibited a painting he completed at Newtown Anner in 1865, which is his only known Irish watercolour. Osborne was an early patron of Calame, and is believed to have employed him to give her daughters guidance in painting. She was interested in photography, with William Despard Hemphill dedicating his collection of published photographs of Clonmel to her in 1860 following her support. Osborne was a talented artist, producing a series of sketchbooks of Irish and English country houses. These are now held in the family home of her daughter in Myrtle Grove, Youghal. She edited and published two volumes of her mother's letters in 1870, Memorials of the life and character of Lady Osborne. Osborne financed the library at Knockmahon in County Waterford. She died at Newtown Anner on 21 June 1880, and is buried at Killaloan church in the family vault."]}, {"page": "Boys (surname)", "response": ["* Thomas Shotter Boys (1803\u20131874), water-colour painter"]}]}}
