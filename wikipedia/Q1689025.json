Armstrong played and recorded in the mid-'60s with Van Morrison and Them, touring both Europe and America (where he lived \u2013 playing and recording - for 4 years). Of the 51 tracks recorded by Morrison and Them (1964\u201366), Armstrong played on over half, and while living in America met and played with Jim Morrison & The Doors, Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa. During this time he was voted 3rd best guitarist in the world (after Jimi Hendrix & Frank Zappa).\nAfter leaving Them in 1969 Armstrong again teamed up with vocalist Kenny McDowell (who had replaced Van Morrison) in Sk'Boo, alongside Ricky McCutcheon and Colm Connolly. Then he and McDowell (born Kenneth McDowell, 21 December 1944, in Belfast, Co Antrim) formed the band Truth (1969\u201371) in Chicago with bassist Curtis Bachman (ex The Buckinghams) and drummer Reno Smith (ex Baby Huey & the Babysitters). They also added ex-Them keyboards/vibes/flute/sax player Ray Elliott (born Raymond Elliott, 13 September 1943, in Belfast, Co Antrim). In the late '70s, after playing with McDowell in Spike, Jim Armstrong was guitarist with Northern Irish rock outfit Light. Armstrong and his 'Light' bandmate Brian Scott also played in a brief 'Them' tour of Germany in 1979. In the '80s Amstrong and McDowell performed with a reformed Sk'Boo. It was with Sk'Boo that he regularly played Belfast's Errigle Inn.\nAt home in Northern Ireland where he worked for the civil service, he was a sought after session musician, and has been involved in many locally produced records and projects with Ulster Television, BBC Television and other radio stations. After touring for 9 years with one of the many incarnations of 'Them - The Belfast Blues Band' in the '90s with Eric Wrixon (the person who gave 'Them' their name, but never toured with the original band), he formed the Jim Armstrong Band with Scottish singer and harp player Jim Gilchrist, bass player Ali McKenzie (ex Belfast Blues Band) and drummer Siggi Heilek (ex Belfast Blues Band). He has played a huge variety of music in his time but blues is his main love. He is currently (2015) living in Las Vegas having moved to the USA following a health glitch when touring with his Jim Armstrong Band in Germany.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 24", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Jim Armstrong, Northern Irish guitarist "]}, {"page": "Mike McCready", "response": ["McCready's second most used guitar is a Gibson Les Paul.
