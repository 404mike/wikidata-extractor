He was a founding member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), a former Stormont MP, and a member of the 1974 Power Sharing Executive.\nDescribed as a \"relentless campaigner against sectarianism\", Devlin had once been a member of the IRA but later renounced physical force republicanism to work at transcending sectarian differences through democratic, socialist and nationalist political means.\nDuring the late 1960s he entered local politics in the Belfast City Council and went on to help found the SDLP in 1970 with John Hume, Gerry Fitt, Austin Currie and others.", "link_mentions": {}}}
