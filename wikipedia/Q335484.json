He was elected a fellow of All Souls College and later appointed lecturer at Merton College. Best known of his many works was The Elizabethan Age trilogy. His work on Shakespeare included a claim to have identified the 'Dark Lady of the Sonnets' as Emilia Lanier, which attracted much interest from scholars, but also many counter-claims.\nRowse was in steady demand as a lecturer in America. In the 1930s, he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the Labour interest, though he ended as a conservative in old age.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
