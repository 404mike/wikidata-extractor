From 1952 he was associated with the weekly journal The Spectator, and after several promotions through the ranks he was appointed Editor in 1962, staying in that position for a year. He was Editorial Director of the Hutchinson group of publishing companies from 1958 to 1962, and after leaving The Spectator became managing director of Kern House Enterprises (1970\u20135). In addition, he wrote a good many articles for the Illustrated London News and the high-brow current affairs magazine Encounter.\nThe most widely known of Hamilton's literary works is his biography of Arthur Koestler, published by Secker & Warburg, London, in 1982 (a year before Koestler's death). His other books were:\n\nSpectrum: A Spectator Miscellany (1956), ed. with Ian Gilmour\nScotland the Brave (1957)\nHalf a Highlander: An Autobiography of a Scottish Youth (1958)\nThe Foster Gang (1966), with H.

Despite a marked increase in sales, Gilmour felt that The Spectator was losing its political edge, so replaced him in 1962 with Iain Hamilton. Hamilton successfully balanced a keener focus on current affairs with some more raucous contributions: the young team behind Private Eye were commissioned to write a mock eight-page \"Child's Guide to Modern Culture\". Much to the shock of Hamilton and the Spectator staff, Gilmour replaced Hamilton in 1963 with Iain Macleod, the Conservative MP who had resigned from the cabinet on the controversial appointment of Sir Alec Douglas-Home to succeed Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister. A widely circulated letter, signed by Spectator journalists and board members, berated Gilmour for mistreating an admired editor and appointing an active politician who could jeopardise the independence of the magazine: \"We believe strongly that The Spectator, with its long and honourable history of independent opinion, should not be tossed about at the whim of the proprietor or lose its independence by identification with a narrow political faction.\"Letter first printed in The Times of 2 Nov. 1963.", "*Iain Hamilton, 1962\u20131963"]}, {"page": "Iain Hamilton", "response": ["Iain Hamilton may refer to:", "*Iain Hamilton (journalist) (1920\u20131986), editor at the Spectator", "*Iain Hamilton (composer) (1922\u20132000), Scottish composer", "*Iain Hamilton Grant, British lecturer"]}]}}
