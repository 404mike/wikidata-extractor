By admission of this article, the term \"magical realism\" first came into artistic usage in 1927 by German critic Franz Roh after the 1915 publication of Franz Kafka's novella \"The Metamorphosis\", both visual and literary representations and uses of magic realism, regardless of suffix nitpicking. The Russian author Nikolai Gogol and his story \"The Nose\" (1835) is also a predecessor to the Hispanic origin theory. All this further called into question by Borges' critical standing as a true magical realist versus a predecessor to magic realism and how the dates of publications between Hispanic and European works compare.  Magic realism has certainly enjoyed a \"golden era\" in the Hispanic communities. It cannot be denied that Hispanic communities, Argentina in particular, have supported great movements and talents in magic realism. One could validly suggest that the height of magic realism has been seen in Latin American countries, though feminist readers might disagree. Virginia Woolf, Angela Carter, Toni Morrison, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman are excellent critical challenges to this notion of Hispanic magic realism as a full and diversely aware aesthetic. Allende's work is a later contribution to this gender aware discourse. Frida Kahlo is also important to this as well, but at a later date than Woolf and Gilman. This feminist mapping, however, is unnecessary in identifying the basic truth that Kafka and Gogol predate Borges. They may each have their own forms of magic realism, but by the broader definition solidly within this article's given identification, their \"...highly detailed, realistic setting[s are] invaded by something too strange to believe....\"", "Taking into account that, theoretically, magical realism was born in the 20th century, some have argued that connecting it to postmodernism is a logical next step. To further connect the two concepts, there are descriptive commonalities between the two that Belgian critic Theo D'haen addresses in his essay, \"Magical Realism and Postmodernism\". While authors such as G\u00fcnter Grass, Thomas Bernhard, Peter Handke, Italo Calvino, John Fowles, Angela Carter, John Banville, Michel Tournier, Willem Brakman, and Louis Ferron might be widely considered postmodernist, they can \"just as easily be categorized...magic realist.\"D'haen, Theo L., \"Magical realism and postmodernism\" from MR: Theory, History, Community, pp. 193 A list has been compiled of characteristics one might typically attribute to postmodernism, but that also could describe literary magic realism: \"self-reflexiveness, metafiction, eclecticism, redundancy, multiplicity, discontinuity, intertextuality, parody, the dissolution of character and narrative instance, the erasure of boundaries, and the destabilization of the reader.\"D'haen, Theo L., \"Magical realism and postmodernism\" from MR: Theory, History, Community, pp. 192-3 [D'haen references many texts that attest to these qualities] To further connect the two, magical realism and postmodernism share the themes of post-colonial discourse, in which jumps in time and focus cannot really be explained with scientific but rather with magical reasoning; textualization (of the reader); and metafiction.", "In the English-speaking world, major authors include British Indian writer Salman Rushdie, African American novelists Toni Morrison (although she has contested this descriptor of her work) and Gloria Naylor, Latinos, as Ana Castillo, Rudolfo Anaya, Daniel Olivas, and Helena Maria Viramontes, Native American authors Louise Erdrich and Sherman Alexie; English author Louis de Berni\u00e8res and English feminist writer Angela Carter. Perhaps the best known is Rushdie, whose \"language form of magical realism straddles both the surrealist tradition of magic realism as it developed in Europe and the mythic tradition of magical realism as it developed in Latin America\". Morrison's most notable work, Beloved, tells the story of a mother who, haunted by the ghost of her child, learns to cope with memories of her traumatic childhood as an abused slave and the burden of nurturing children into a harsh and brutal society.
