In 1862, his widowed grandmother, Lady Queensberry, converted to Roman Catholicism and took her children to live in Paris.Lady Florence Dixie  at Spartacus-Educational.com (accessed 26 February 2019) One of his uncles, Lord James Douglas, was deeply attached to his twin sister \"Florrie\" (Lady Florence Douglas) and was heartbroken when she married a baronet, Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie. In 1885, Lord James tried to abduct a young girl, and after that became ever more manic; in 1888, he made a disastrous marriage.Douglas, Murray, Bosie: A Biography of Lord Alfred Douglas, Chapter One online at nytimes.com (accessed 8 March 2008). Separated from Florrie, James drank himself into a deep depression, and in 1891 committed suicide by cutting his throat.

In 1892, Lady Florence Dixie criticised hare coursing as an \"aggravated form of torture\" and the League Against Cruel Sports was established in 1924 to campaign against rabbit coursing on Morden Common and continues to believe that it is wrong to expose animals to the risk of injury or death for human entertainment. The Waterloo Cup became a centrepiece of the campaign against coursing in the UK. In opposition, coursing has long enjoyed the fame of being known as \"the noblest of field sports\" precisely because the death of the hare is not the aim of the sport. Under most regulated forms of coursing only two hounds pursue the hare, the dogs competing against each other for a short time, and allowing the hare a significant chance of escape."]}, {"page": "National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies", "response": ["*Lady Florence Dixie"]}, {"page": "Puerto Natales", "response": ["In 1870, interest in the region of Ultima Esperanza was rekindled.
