After the failure of the Quiberon expedition earlier in 1795, when the British landed a force of French royalists on the coast of France who were annihilated by the forces of the republic, Pitt had decided it was crucial for Britain to have St. Domingue, no matter what the cost in lives and money, to improve Britain's negotiating hand when it came time to make peace with the French republic. The British historian Michael Duffy argued that since Pitt committed far more manpower and money to the Caribbean expeditions, especially the one to St. Domingue, than he ever did to Europe in the years 1793\u20131798, it is proper to view the West Indies as Britain's main theatre of war and Europe as more of a sideshow. By 1795, 50% of the British Army was deployed in the West Indies (with the largest contingent in St. Domingue), whereas the rest of the British Army was divided among Britain, Europe, India, and North America."]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Michael Duffy"]}, {"page": "Michael Duffy", "response": ["Michael Duffy may refer to:", "*Michael Duffy (Australian journalist), Australian crime novelist", "*Michael Duffy (Australian politician) (born 1938), Australian politician", "*Michael Duffy (Irish politician) (fl. 1922\u20131936), Irish politician and trade unionist", "*Michael Duffy (historian), British historian", "*Michael Duffy (American journalist), American journalist and assistant managing editor for Time magazine", "*Michael Duffy (footballer) (born 1994), Northern Irish footballer", "*Michael Duffy (Queensland politician) (1850\u20131926), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*Michael Duffy (equestrian), Irish showjumper"]}, {"page": "The Mariner's Mirror", "response": ["* 1991-2000- Michael Duffy, D.Phil."]}, {"page": "1805 Club", "response": ["* Touch and Take: The Battle of Trafalgar 21 October 1805, by Michael Duffy.
