He entered Eton College in 1782, and became very intimate with John Hookham Frere, George Canning, and Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland. With them in 1786 he started the school magazine entitled \"The Microcosm\", which ran for forty volumes, and procured for Smith an introduction to Queen Charlotte. In 1788 he became a scholar on Dr. Battie's foundation, and in 1791 obtained Sir William Browne's medal for the best Latin ode. In the same year he entered King's College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1794 and M.A. in 1797. On 4 July of the same year he was called to the bar of Lincoln's Inn.\nIn 1803, through the influence of William Petty, first Marquess of Lansdowne, and Sir Francis Baring, he obtained the appointment of Judge Advocate General of Bengal. In seven years he returned to England with a fortune, and settled in London. While in India he allowed his brother Sydney \u00a3100 a year, and on his return lent him \u00a3500 towards the expenses of his move into the country, and gave \u00a3100 a year to support Sydney's eldest son at Westminster.\nIn 1812 Smith entered House of Commons as member for Grantham, but made no reputation as a speaker. At the general election of 1818 he contested Lincoln unsuccessfully, but two years later he won the seat and sat as the representative of the borough until his retirement after the dissolution of 1826.\nAlthough Robert Percy never attained the fame of his brother Sydney, with whom he always maintained very affectionate relations, yet those who were intimate with both held that \"Bobus\" equalled, if he did not surpass, him in the very qualities for which the younger was renowned. He was a man of great originality, a profound thinker, and of wide grasp of mind. His wit was proverbial, and his conversation provoked the admiration of Madame de Sta\u00ebl. His language was characterised by Canning as \"the essence of English,\" and Landor declared that his Latin hexameters would not have discredited Lucretius. A number of Smith's Latin verses were published by his son under the title of \"Early Writings of Robert Percy Smith,\" Chiswick, 1850, quarto.\nSmith was also a member of the New River Company, who developed part of Finsbury as the head of the New River, and Percy Circus in Finsbury is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Smith", "response": ["*Robert Percy Smith (1770\u20131845), British lawyer and Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Baron Lyveden", "response": ["Robert Percy Smith, father of the first Baron, was also a politician.
