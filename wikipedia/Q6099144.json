Peters spent his life in Bath, Somerset and is best known for his amateur photographs and cine films of steam railways in the British Isles, particularly of the Somerset and Dorset Railway.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Railfan", "response": ["Some railroad photographers have become well known for their works. Many railfans are familiar with the works of H. Reid, Otto Perry and O. Winston Link; in the UK with Derek Cross (1929\u201384), John Whitehouse, Maurice W. Earley (1900\u201382), Rev. Alfred H. Malan (1852\u20131928), Brian W. Morrison, Ivo Peters, Jim Spurling (1926\u2013Present), H. Gordon Tidey and Rev. Eric Treacy; in New Zealand, with W.W.

Its main line climbed to  above sea level at Masbury, and it contained several single line sections, but on summer Saturdays it managed to handle a considerable volume of holiday trains, when it seemed every possible locomotive was drafted into service to handle heavy trains requiring double-heading and banking over the steep gradients."]}, {"page": "Pines Express", "response": ["The Pines Express became known as the top express to use the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJR); a steeply-graded railway line through photogenic hilly countryside between Bath Green Park and Bournemouth West station, much loved and sorely missed by enthusiasts.  On this line, trains often had to be double-headed due to gradients, producing spectacular photographs and film footage. Ivo Peters, in particular, took many amateur photographs and cine films of the S&DJR."]}, {"page": "Mortehoe and Woolacombe railway station", "response": ["The station was opened in 1874, with the line, and served the villages of Mortehoe and Woolacombe. It was known as Morthoe until 13 May 1902. The station was the location of eminent railway photographer Ivo Peters's first steam train photograph in 1925; and was immortalised in 1964 in the song Slow Train by Flanders and Swann. It was closed to passengers in October 1970 when the branch closed."]}, {"page": "Union Mills railway station", "response": ["In 1946 the opening scenes of the film I See a Dark Stranger were filmed in and around the station which doubled for a station in Ireland; the scene saw one of the lead characters boarding a train here, being double-headed by locomotives No. 12 Hutchinson and No. 13 Kissack, both of which survive in service today.  Other locations on the island were also used for filming.  Other notable filming that took place here includes the work of renowned railway photographer Ivo Peters who visited the island to record its transport networks in 1961,1963,1968."]}, {"page": "Peters (surname)", "response": ["*Ivo Peters (1915\u20131989), English photographer of steam railways"]}, {"page": "Patrick Whitehouse", "response": ["Newly married, Whitehouse bought a Rolleiflex camera, and began chronicling the demise of steam and the railways in some of his favourite railway locations in the West Midlands. These were supplemented by photographs from SLS tours organised by the Birmingham Mafia, including one Whitehouse co-arranged on the Ashover Light Railway, Derbyshire. Inspired by H Fayle's book Narrow Gauge Railways of Ireland, Whitehouse and his wife toured Ireland in the summers of the early 1950s, in 1952 accompanied by fellow publisher Ian Allan, with the group especially enjoying chasing trains along the Tralee and Dingle Railway. These tours are also where Whitehouse met fellow enthusiasts who would later play a key role in preservation of the UK's steam railway heritage, including Ivo Peters, Henry S Orbach and Peter Allen, later knighted for his chairmanship of Imperial Chemical Industries. With a good volume and sufficient personal confidence in his own photographic ability, in the mid-1950s Whitehouse submitted a selected portfolio to the Royal Photographic Society, and in 1958 co-authored with John Powell published a book on the Tralee & Dingle."]}, {"page": "Danny Beath", "response": ["Like his great uncle Ivo Peters, Beath's main passion in life was photography. His photographic subjects included a wide range of insects (especially beetles, butterflies and moths), amphibians and birds as well as the flora of tropical rainforests, which were the subject of his thesis. He was completely self-taught, and it was when studying for his PhD at The University of Aberdeen that his passion really took off. He joined the university's camera club and started to refine his photographic technique and also developed an interest in photographing Scottish landscapes. In the last decade he had focused photographing the natural landscapes in and around his hometown of Shrewsbury. He was a keen member of the Shropshire Photographic Society and was the club's competition secretary for several years. During 2010 he was commissioned to write a monthly feature about Shropshire photography through the seasons in Shropshire Life magazine."]}, {"page": "Ivo", "response": ["*Ivo Peters (1915\u20131989), British photographer"]}, {"page": "The Train Now Departing", "response": ["The Train Now Departing: Twenty Years After the End of Steam is a 1988 BBC Two documentary series about railways that was broadcast 20 years after the end of steam on British Railways.
