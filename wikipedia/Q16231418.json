He began the season as second choice to Craig Gordon, but made his competitive debut in the Scottish League on 22 August 2015 in a 3\u20131 win away at Dundee United. Bailly's next appearance was in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup on 10 January 2016, deputising for the suspended Craig Gordon. He had little to do as Celtic eased to a comfortable 3\u20130 win over lower league Stranraer, and his only save came with 12 minutes remaining when he saved a Craig Malcolm header."]}, {"page": "David Proctor (footballer, born 1984)", "response": ["Proctor then returned to Scotland and signed for Airdrieonians in July 2014.
