Hamnet Holditch, also spelled Hamnett Holditch (1800 \u2013 12 December 1867), was an English mathematician who was president of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.\nIn 1858, he introduced the result in geometry now known as Holditch's theorem.\nHamnet Holditch was born in 1800 at Lynn, Norfolk. In 1818, he began his studies of mathematics at the University of Cambridge (Caius College), having obtained his bachelor's degree (B.A.) in 1822 and his master's degree (M.A.) in 1825. He was Senior Wrangler in the Tripos and was awarded the Smith's Prize of 1822. He was a Fellow of Caius College, and its President from 1835 until 1867, when he died.He was the only son of George Holditch, and had two sisters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Holditch's theorem", "response": ["In plane geometry, Holditch's theorem states that if a chord of fixed length is allowed to rotate inside a convex closed curve, then the locus of a point on the chord a distance p from one end and a distance q from the other is a closed curve whose enclosed area is less than that of the original curve by \\pi pq. The theorem was published in 1858 by Rev. Hamnet Holditch. While not mentioned by Holditch, the proof of the theorem requires an assumption that the chord be short enough that the traced locus is a simple closed curve."]}, {"page": "Hamnett Holditch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hamnet Holditch"]}, {"page": "Holditch", "response": ["*Hamnet Holditch (1800-1867), English mathematician", "*Holditch's theorem in plane geometry, named after Hamnet Holditch"]}, {"page": "Hamnet (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Hamnet Holditch (1800\u20131867), English mathematician"]}]}}
