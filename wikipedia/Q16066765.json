He contributed to Warmley becoming inaugural champions of the Bristol & District League, in 1892\u201393; the Bristol Mercury's preview of the season to come described him as \"a most valuable half-back in last year's team\".Ahead of the 1893\u201394 Football League season, he turned professional with Lincoln City.
