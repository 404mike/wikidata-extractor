On the April 29 episode the competition ensued which Sting admitted that Sheik had won, leading to a match between the two at Music City Showdown. On May 7 the two faced off, and Sheik was defeated by TV Champion Sting. In August 1989, he would form a brief alliance with Ron Simmons, appearing in his corner during a match with Jon Brewer. He would appear later that month in the corner of Simmons & The Cuban Assassin in a victory over Tommy Rich and Eddie Gilbert. On August 26, Simmons and Sheik were guests of Paul E.

Soon after the change, Brewer was approached by Castle Communications, a British independent label with an interest in releasing a Yes album on its subsidiary label, Essential Records. Brewer and Castle agreed to the idea on the condition that the album featured the band's original or \"classic\" line-up from the 1970s, which included guitarist Steve Howe and keyboardist Rick Wakeman. The pair had left in 1992 after the band's Union Tour and continued with their solo projects, but were interested to return and met with Anderson in Los Angeles for several days to discuss the situation. In July 1995, the five agreed to work together and make the album; it marked the start of Howe's third stint in the band and Wakeman's fourth. This marked the first time this line-up had played together since their unsuccessful attempt to record a new album in early 1980. Squire later revealed the initial plan of having both Keys to Ascension albums feature just live recordings, but Castle wished for them to contain new tracks recorded in the studio. The group agreed to release the album with the aim of letting the public know that the five had reunited, and Anderson wished to explore the music that the line-up had recorded in the 1970s and take Yes \"into the 21st century\".", "*Jon Brewer\u00a0\u2013 management"]}, {"page": "Open Your Eyes (Yes album)", "response": ["By mid-1997, the Yes line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White had recorded Keys to Ascension (1996) and Keys to Ascension 2 (1997), two double albums containing live and studio material recorded in 1995 and 1996. The studio tracks were produced by American musician Billy Sherwood, who befriended Squire in 1989 and wrote songs together at a time when Anderson had left the band and Sherwood was being considered as his replacement. Sherwood had also contributed to the band's album Union (1991) and played additional guitar and keyboards on their Talk (1994) tour. When a tour in support of the Keys to Ascension albums was being planned, Yes suffered a setback after Wakeman, who disagreed with how Keys to Ascension 2 was to be packaged and promoted and was unable commit to touring due to solo commitments and management conflicts, left the band causing dates booked for June and July 1997 to be cancelled. Band talks with their then-manager Jon Brewer broke down, leaving Anderson to retreat to Hawaii and White and Howe returning home to Seattle and England, respectively. Sherwood recalled Brewer \"didn't have a clue\", adding: \"I just grabbed the ball and said, 'I'm not going to watch my favorite band go down here. I've got to do something, let's start writing some songs.'\""]}, {"page": "Sutton Valence School", "response": ["* Jon Brewer  English documentary director and producer who was formerly a manager of rock music acts and artists"]}, {"page": "Life of Riley", "response": ["* B.B.
