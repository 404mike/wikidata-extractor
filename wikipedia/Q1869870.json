Lord Frederick also wrote the three- volume set of books, The Days Before Yesterday, Vanished Pomps of Yesterday and Here, There and Everywhere,  which were first published in 1920 by Hodder and Stoughton Ltd, London. These give vivid, sometimes amusing and always well-written accounts of his early life, life in the diplomatic service, and travels.\nWhile serving as aide-de-camp to Lord Lansdowne, then Governor-General of Canada, in Ottawa, In January 1887, Lord Frederick was the first person to introduce skiing to Canada, using skis he had brought from Russia. As he recounts, he used to \"slide down the toboggan slides at Ottawa on them, to universal derision\". He was told they were \"unsuited to Canadian conditions, and would never be popular in Canada\".\nFrom 1896 to 1900, he was editor of the Pall Mall Magazine. He never married and died without children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn", "response": ["*Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton (1856\u20131928)"]}, {"page": "Indian rope trick", "response": ["Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton in 1921, described an alleged demonstration of the trick, told to him by Colonel Bernard.Hamilton, Frederick Spencer.

However, the courtyard had been filled with dense smoke and when he had developed the photographs they revealed that \"neither the juggler, nor the boy, nor the rope had moved at all.\" This caused Hamilton to suggest that the juggler had somehow drugged or hypnotized Bernard.
