Later, in Washington DC, intelligence analyst Dr. Chappell (Christine Adams) concludes that some sort of mind control device must have been used. A Delta Force commando team is sent to Uruguay to investigate, but they are quickly ambushed and captured.

Suddenly, six female Jaffa warriors storm in and take out the attackers. One of the warriors, Mala (Christine Adams) tells SG-1 they have sought them out and asks the team to accompany them back to their outpost, called Hak'tyl. SG-1 are introduced to their leader Ishta (Jolene Blalock), who explains that she is part of a resistance against the Goa'uld Moloc. They learn that Moloc has declared that all female Jaffa born within his domain be executed, as he believes that only male Jaffa can win his war against enemy Goa'uld's. Ishta, Mala and Neith (Kathleen Duborg), all of who serve Moloc, tell Major Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) that they have been secretly saving newborn female Jaffa, smuggling them back to Hak'tyl. Needing Goa'uld symbiotes to survive, the Hak'tyl have been ambushing Jaffa patrols in order to take their symbiotes and give them to Hak'tyl when they come of age. Ishta appeals to Carter that Earth help them in procuring the Goa'uld symbiotes, and Carter explains to them that they've developed a drug called Tretonin that can be used instead of a symbiote. The idea is detestable to Neith, whose younger sister, Nesa, is fast approaching the age where she will need a symbiote. ", "Jolene Blalock portrays the character of Ishta, the leader of the Hak'tyl and Priestess of the Goa'uld System Lord Moloc. The character was written by Judge with actress Blalock in mind, although Judge didn't believe that Blalock would actually be willing or able. When casting the role, Victoria Pratt was also considered for the part. When creating the part, Judge's main aim was to try write a strong Jaffa character and tried not to think about what gender they would be. Blalock would later return in the season 8 episode \"Sacrifices\". Other members of the Hak'tyl include Christine Adams as Mala, Kathleen Duborg as Neith, Kirsten Zien as Nesa and Simone Bailly in the part of Ka'lel. Bailly believed her character would only appear in one episode, but she later reprised the part in season 8 and then reoccurred in  season 9 and 10, with the character eventually becoming the representative of the Hak'tyl on the Free Jaffa High Council. Bailly, who maintained relationships with the shows creative team after SG-1 ended was invited to appear as the character of Lincoln in Stargate Universe. Elizabeth Weinstein\tand Julie Hill also play Hak'tyl characters Emta and Ginra, as does Nikki Smook, partner of producer Michael Greenburg, who plays the part of Nictal. Greenburg asked Smook to appear as she had equestrian experience, as production required a number of actors who could comfortable ride horses. Smook also previously appeared as the character Nikka in \"Scorched Earth\". Judge's at the time girlfriend also appears as a background member of the Hak'tyl.

Alyssa soon adjusts to island life, and she discovers the gift that she shares with her father for communicating with dolphins, a skill which leads her into a powerful relationship with a wild dolphin which her father, for legitimate scientific reasons, cannot condone.
