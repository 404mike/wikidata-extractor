He made his first century break made aged 15 and his first maximum break aged 17. After winning a number of titles in Wales, in 1991 Davies turned professional. His best performance was at the 1996 European Open, where he reached the quarter-finals. In 2002 he also reached the last 16 of the World Championship. Davies remained in the top 32 in the world rankings for three seasons, peaking at #26, until a disappointing 2003/2004 season in which he failed to win a match. After failing to regain his form, he was relegated from the main tour in 2005, and retired from snooker in 2006.\nSince 1998, he has been an official coach for World Snooker. He has established two junior clubs in the South Wales area, helping to increase participation levels and improve playing performance amongst local snooker players. In April 2008 he worked on a pilot scheme, called \u2018KIS\u2019 [Kids Into Snooker], set up by Cuefactor in conjunction with the Paul Hunter Foundation, the aim being to help generate interest in snooker amongst disadvantaged young people.Davies made a brief return to competitive snooker in 2013, entering the sixth event of the European Tour, the Kay Suzanne Memorial Cup. Having come through the amateur rounds, he then defeated Anthony McGill and Nigel Bond to reach the last 32, where he lost to Joel Walker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Snooker world rankings 2004/2005", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 2003/2004", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 2002/2003", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 2001/2002", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 2000/2001", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "List of snooker players", "response": ["*Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 1998/1999", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 1997/1998", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 1996/1997", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 1995/1996", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 1994/1995", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "Davies", "response": ["* Anthony Davies, Welsh snooker player"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 1999/2000", "response": ["| Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "2005 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["|   Scott MacKenzie 10\u20137  Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "2004 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["|   Andy Hicks 10\u20138  Anthony Davies"]}, {"page": "2002 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["The second round featured matches played as the best-of-25 frames held over up to three sessions.
