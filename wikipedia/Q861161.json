An official promotional video was created for \"Second Bad Vilbel\" from Anvil Vapre by English visual artist Chris Cunningham (his first). The \"Second Bad Vilbel\" video featured rapidly cut shots of industrial machinery and robotic movement, synchronised with the music. Cunningham later re-edited the video in 2002, following his disappointment with the original: \"It was intended to be completely abstract but it didn't quite work out that way\". A two track vinyl-only EP entitled We R Are Why, was available to buy during certain concerts and via mail order during 1996.

Some of his unproduced work for A.I. can be seen on the DVD, The Work of Director Chris Cunningham. Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role. Cunningham helped assemble a series of \"little robot-type humans\" for the David character. \"We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing,\" producer Jan Harlan reflected. \"But it was a total failure, it looked awful.\" Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant. Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought A.I. would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director. Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects, and convinced Kubrick to remain as director.

The Personally E.P. arrived later that year, which featured two album tracks and two exclusive songs; \"Happy Hour\" and \"Feel My Beard.\"  12 Rounds would also release a double single from the album; Business / Pleasant Smell.

The piece was the first to be recorded of the set and was originally commissioned to be used in a computer game, but Squarepusher decided it was too important to hand over to somebody else's project. The track immediately became a favourite at gigs and was still making appearances as an encore in Tom's run of live shows in 2013. \"The Body Builder\" was Tom's favourite of the set. This exemplifies a more abstract take on the 8-bit aesthetic, with sounds constructed to deliberately resemble computer game sound effects. \"Come on My Selector\" has become one of Squarepusher's most well known tracks, partly due to it having a video by director Chris Cunningham. Doing the video led Squarepusher to develop a friendship with Chris Cunningham.", "Early 2000 saw Squarepusher consider \"radical tactics\". He states it became clear that it was high time return to sequencers and leave behind the live-playing approach, which he had adopted since late 1997. Around this time, he started seeing more of Chris Cunningham.", "He was also revisiting a lot of the mid-1990s drum and bass that had so inspired his early releases. He describes the set-up for Go Plastic as follows: \"It was the next stage in the \"liquid effects processing\" idea. \"To me it was all about trying to make it sound totally liquid and psychedelic, like liquid LSD. Not evil though, \"evil\" music just sounds daft and theatrical to me. I've always had a Frankenstein-thing going on, ever since I was kid when I was playing around with electronics. I love the idea of the set-up having such a complex level of internal activity that it begins to resemble a living being.\" \"My Red Hot Car\" is his most well known piece. That and \"Boneville Occident\" were two of the earliest pieces from these sessions. The piece \"Tommib\" was so named after Squarepusher recalls that: \"Aphex [Twin] was helping me edit a track for Vic Acid and he named the project 'Tommib' and I always remembered that for some reason.\" Squarepusher claims that \"My Fucking Sound\" was written specifically with Chris Cunningham in mind: \"We had talked a lot in that period about working together, loads of ideas were flying around. That track was intended for Chris to use, and that project was called \"Spectral Musicians.\" He recalls that \"Aphex [Twin] rang up when I was finishing off the track. He asked what I was up to and I said something like \"I've got 31 bars left to write on this track I'm doing.\" He just started laughing and said he never thought of music like that. I suppose it does sound a bit strange and clinical.\"", "He played his first shows in America at this point, one of which was at the Coachella Festival.
