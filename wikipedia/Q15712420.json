"]}, {"page": "Cambrai Homily", "response": ["One of the primary means of achieving glas martyrdom is fasting, a common penance which gained special significance from the practice of fasting as codified in early Irish law. A person with an unanswered claim against a social superior might threaten or enact a hunger strike (trocsad) against him, taking up a position outside his residence and potentially polluting his house and family with the responsibility of the faster's death. Irish saints fasted not only to mortify the flesh, but to coerce secular authorities and even to convince God himself. According to the Betha Adamn\u00e1in and some Irish annals, for instance, St. Adomn\u00e1n fasted and immersed himself every night in the River Boyne as a protest against the kingship of \u00cdrgalach mac Conaing. D.A. Binchy has argued that the trocsad, a term that came into use also for hagiography, had a distinctively Irish character,Binchy, \"A Pre-Christian Survival in Mediaeval Irish Hagiography,\" in Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe, pp. 168ff, especially 176\u2013177, with notes 34 and 35 detailing sources on Adomn\u00e1n. leading perhaps to the use of the Celtic color word.According to Pliny (Historia naturalis 22.2), glastum was a Continental Celtic word (glaston) for the plant dye (most often identified as woad) used by the ancient Britons to tint their bodies blue or blue-black for sacred rites. See Xavier Delamarre, \u201cGlaston, glasson,\u201d in Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (\u00c9ditions Errance, 2003) p. 180, and Gillian Carr, \"Woad, Tattooing and Identity in Later Iron Age and Early Roman Britain,\" Oxford Journal of Archaeology 24 (2005) 273\u2013292, especially pp. 278\u2013279, though Carr says that glastum is not woad. Caesar (Bellum Gallicum 5.4) calls this coloration vitrum, a usual Latin word for \"glass.\" Old Irish glas is etymologically related to the English word glass, Old English gl\u00e6s, and to Latin glaesum, \"amber\", also called electrum (the latter word sometimes meaning \"electrum\"). According to the Acta sanctorum, William of Gellone emulated Christ's mortification and \"then went to the sacred altar purer than electrum and clearer than glass\"; see Giles Constable, Three Studies in Medieval Religious and Social Thought (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 198 online. The use of the color word glas by the Cambrai homilist to denote a kind of martyrdom may convey a range of sacred connotations, and the complexity of this word grouping may indicate some confusion of color and substance."]}, {"page": "Haskins Medal", "response": ["* 1969: Giles Constable, The Letters of Peter the Venerable. 2 vols.
