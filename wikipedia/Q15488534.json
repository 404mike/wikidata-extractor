It is clear from his last place in the index to the Florentine Digest, that Hermogenian belonged to the last generation of jurists exploited by Justinian's compilers. References to plural principes and imperatores in several Digest extracts from the Iuris epitomae are certainly consistent with a tetrarchic date.Digest. 28.1.41, 39.4.10, and 49.14.46. It is probably on this work that his subsequent high reputation was based; the fifth-century author Coelius Sedulius calls Hermogenian a doctissimus iurislator ('most learned relator of the law') and it is probably of the Iuris epitomae (rather than the Codex) that the same author claims that he produced three editions.Sedulius, Opus Paschale: Epistula ad Macedonium altera (), p. 172, lines 10\u201311: Cognoscant Hermogenianum, doctissimum iurislatorem, tres editiones sui operis confecisse. By analysing the style of the surviving extracts of the Iuris epitomae Tony Honor\u00e9 has identified Hermogenian also as the drafter of the emperor Diocletian's rescripts (replies to petitions) from the beginning of AD 293 to the end of 294, a task that would have been the job of the emperor's (procurator) a libellis or magister libellorum (master of petitions). These rescripts formed the core of his compilation of imperial laws, the single-book codex that bore his name, which was perhaps designed to function as a supplement to the Codex Gregorianus that itself had gathered up material from as far back as the emperor Hadrian.

Together, the four parts are known as the Corpus Juris Civilis.
