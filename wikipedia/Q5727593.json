He was educated at Winchester College, before going up to Exeter College, Oxford to study law. He played first-class cricket for Hampshire in 1900 and 1902, against Leicestershire and Surrey respectively. He had little success in his two first-class matches, scoring 26 runs with a highest score of 15. He was described by Wisden as \"possessing a fine drive\". He played his club cricket for Alton Cricket Club, being dismissed in unusual fashion while playing for them when he was bowled by Henry Roberts after the ball had deflected off, and killed, a swallow. A member of the Middle Temple, he was called to the bar in 1902, where he practiced on the Western Circuit. Bentinck served in the Rifle Brigade with the 13th Battalion in the First World War, being appointed a temporary lieutenant in February 1915, with appointment to the temporary rank of captain in October of the same year. He transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force in April 1918, retaining the temporary rank of captain. His military service finished in February 1919. Bentinck died at Winchester in June 1931. His brother-in-law was Charles Seymour, a fellow first-class cricketer."]}, {"page": "Frank Collins (English cricketer)", "response": ["Collins made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in the 1923 County Championship. Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to field first. Put into bat, Sussex made 259 all out in their first-innings, with Collins scoring 27 runs before he was the last man out, dismissed by Len Richmond. Nottinghamshire responded in their first-innings by making 294 all out, with Collins opening the bowling with Henry Roberts. Collins bowled eleven wicketless overs, conceding 33 runs. Sussex then made 169 all out in their second-innings, with Collins once again the last man out, dismissed this time for a duck by Sam Staples. The match ended as a draw. This was his only major appearance for Sussex."]}]}}
