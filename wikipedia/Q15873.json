May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor. His songwriting contributions helped Queen become one of the most successful bands in rock history.\nMay previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. After Queen's formation in 1970, bass player John Deacon joined to complete the line-up in 1971. They became one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A Night at the Opera and its single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen played at some of the biggest venues in the world, including at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician. He was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special. May wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"We Will Rock You\", \"I Want It All\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"Flash\", \"Hammer to Fall\", \"Save Me\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\", and \"The Show Must Go On\".\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the 1992 tribute concert, the release of Made in Heaven (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the seventh-greatest guitarist of all time. He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". In 2012, he was ranked the second-greatest guitarist in a Guitar World magazine readers poll. In 2001, May was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen and in 2018 the band received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.May was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for \"services to the music industry and for charity work\".

In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists.", "In April 1970, Mercury teamed up with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, to become lead singer of their band Smile. They were joined by bassist John Deacon in 1971. Despite the reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name \"Queen\" for the new band. He later said, \"It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it.\" At about the same time, he legally changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury. It was inspired by the line \"Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me\" from his song \"My Fairy King\".", "The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey described Mercury as \"the best virtuoso rock 'n' roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in any style. He could change his style from line to line and, God, that's an art. And he was brilliant at it.\"O'Donnell, Jim (2013).

Discussing what type of person he wanted to play the lead role in his musical Jesus Christ Superstar, Andrew Lloyd Webber said: \"He has to be of enormous charisma, but he also has to be a genuine, genuine rock tenor. That's what it is. Really think Freddie Mercury, I mean that's the kind of range we're talking about.\"", "Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from the crowd. A writer for The Spectator described him as \"a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself.\" David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song \"Under Pressure\" with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: \"Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest [\u2026] he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.\" Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make \"the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected\". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand; after accidentally snapping it off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised it could be used in endless ways.", "As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-orientated: his favourite artists at the time were the Who, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments. However Brian May states Mercury \"had a wonderful touch on the piano. He could play what came from inside him like nobody else \u2013 incredible rhythm, incredible passion and feeling.\" Keyboardist Rick Wakeman praised Mercury's playing style, saying he \"discovered [the piano] for himself\" and successfully composed a number of Queen songs on the instrument. From the early 1980s Mercury began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John, and Supertramp) for his first solo project. From 1982 Mercury collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert during the Hot Space leg), and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).", "Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Somebody to Love\", and \"Don't Stop Me Now\". He used concert grand pianos (such as a Bechstein) and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Brian May claims that Mercury used the piano less over time because he wanted to walk around on stage and entertain the audience. Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like \"Ogre Battle\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio.", "In the early 1970s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. Austin, born in Fulham, London, met Mercury in 1969 when she was 19 and he was 24 years old, a year before Queen had formed. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, he had begun an affair with David Minns, an American record executive at Elektra Records. In December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, and bought Austin a place of her own nearby his new address of 12 Stafford Terrace, Kensington.", "A statue in Montreux, Switzerland, by sculptor Irena Sedleck\u00e1, was erected as a tribute to Mercury. It stands almost 10 feet (3 metres) high overlooking Lake Geneva and was unveiled on 25 November 1996 by Mercury's father and Montserrat Caball\u00e9, with bandmates Brian May and Roger Taylor also in attendance.
