He commenced his career at King's College London before being appointed to the Kirby Laing Chair of New Testament Exegesis at the University of Aberdeen in 1999. In 2007 he took up his current position as Professor in the Department of Theology and Religion at the Durham University.Watson is well known as a critic of the so-called New Perspective on Paul (NPP). His criticisms of the NPP are all the more significant as he received a positive endorsement of James D.G. Dunn (a NPP proponent) for his doctoral study. After the latter endorsement, Watson explored in particular the social-scientific work of Klaus Berger which contributed to Watson changing his mind dramatically about some results of his unpublished thesis. The result was Paul, Judaism, and the Gentiles: A Sociological Approach, which chronicles Watson's change of mind.\nWatson's 2013 volume, Gospel Writing. A Canonical Approach, is his most voluminous study to date. Extensive critical review articles include those by Markus Bockmuehl and Richard Bauckham.\nTed Dorman suggests that for Watson, \"hermeneutical sovereignty resides not in the text but in the subject matter to which it points\" \u2013 namely, Jesus Christ.Watson is the editor of New Testament Studies.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Predestination", "response": ["Biblical scholar N. T. Wright argues that Josephus's portrayal of these groups is incorrect, and that the Jewish debates referenced by Josephus should be seen as having to do with God's work to liberate Israel rather than philosophical questions about predestination. Wright asserts that Essenes were content to wait for God to liberate Israel while Pharisees believed Jews needed to act in cooperation with God. John Barclay responded that Josephus's description was an over-simplification and there were likely to be complex differences between these groups which may have been similar to those described by Josephus. Francis Watson has also argued on the basis of 4 Ezra, a document dated to the first century AD, that Jewish beliefs in predestination are primarily concerned with God's choice to save some individual Jews."]}, {"page": "Secret Gospel of Mark", "response": ["In 2001, Philip Jenkins drew attention to a novel by James H. Hunter entitled The Mystery of Mar Saba, which first appeared in 1940 and was popular at the time. Jenkins saw unusual parallels to Clement's letter to Theodore and Smith's description of his discovery in 1958, but did not explicitly state that the novel inspired Smith to forge the text. Later Robert M. Price, Francis Watson and Craig A. Evans developed the theory that Morton Smith would have been inspired by this novel to forge the letter. This assumption has been contested by, among others, Scott G. Brown, who writes that apart from \"a scholar discovering a previously unknown ancient Christian manuscript at Mar Saba, there are few parallels\" \u2013 and in a rebuttal to Evans, he and Allan J. Pantuck find the alleged parallel between the Scotland Yard detective Lord Moreton's last name and Morton Smith's first name puzzling, since Morton Smith got his name long before the novel was written. Francis Watson finds the parallels so convincing that \"the question of dependence is unavoidable\", while Allan J. Pantuck thinks they are too generic or too artful to be persuasive. Javier Mart\u00ednez, who thinks the question of forgery is open to debate, regards the suggestion that Hunter's novel would have inspired Smith to forge the text to be outlandish. He wonders why it took more than four decades after the story of Smith's discovery made the front page of the New York Times before anyone realized that this so popular novel was Smith's source. Mart\u00ednez finds Watson's methods, by which he reaches the conclusion that \"[t]here is no alternative but to conclude that Smith is dependent on\" The Mystery of Mar Saba, to be \"surreal as a work of scholarship\". Timo Paananen asserts that neither Evans nor Watson clarifies what criteria they use to establish that these particular parallels are so \"amazing, both in substance and in language\", and that they reduce the rigor of their criteria compared to how they dismiss \"literary dependencies in other context\".", "The two camps could be illustrated, on the one hand by Larry Hurtado, who thinks it is \"inadvisable to rest too much on Secret Mark\" as the letter \"that quotes it might be a forgery\" and even if it is genuine, Secret Mark \"may be at most an ancient but secondary edition of Mark produced in the second century by some group seeking to promote its own esoteric interests\", and by Francis Watson, who hopes and expects that Secret Mark will be increasingly ignored by scholars to avoid \"that their work will be corrupted by association with it\". On the other hand, by Marvin Meyer, who assumes the letter to be authentic and in several articles, beginning in 1983, used Secret Mark in his reconstructions, especially regarding the young man (neaniskos) \"as a model of discipleship\", and by Eckhard Rau, who argues that as long as a physical examination of the manuscript is not possible and no new arguments against authenticity can be put forward, it is, although not without risk, judicious to interpret the text as originating from the circle of Clement of Alexandria.", ":* Francis Watson, \"Beyond Reasonable Doubt: A Response to Allan J.
