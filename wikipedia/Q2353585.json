In 1868, in partnership with Dempster, Barker and Gull, he introduced the 'hard hat' to the pearling industry a full twenty years ahead of its time, only to fail. When the demands on the native divers became untenable, he  was also one of the first settlers to import what were then generally, but incorrectly, called Malay pearl divers.McCarthy, M., 2009.

New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum.  The loss of the Xantho  after only a few voyages caused Broadhurst substantial financial difficulties. Unable to continue as a pearler in the north west,  he  took his men to Shark Bay, there joining Francis Cadell as the two leaders in the industry.

He then sought a writ of certiorari and the judgement was set aside by the Supreme Court in January 1876 on the technicality that the notice had been given to his nephew Daniel and not to Broadhurst personally. Broadhurst experimented with the sale of Shark Bay shell in London 1878, but failed. He pioneered fish-canning at Mandurah with considerable success, but soon sold the enterprise. By 1884, he had established the guano industry at the Houtman Abrolhos; though he worked energetically in the industry until 1890 he did not prove a success. In that year, he retired in favour of his son, Florance Broadhurst, who with his mercantile education proved enormously successful. In excavating the Gun Island guano deposits,  F.C. Broadhurst's men unearthed relics from the Dutch East India Company ship . He catalogued these finds and presented them to the State of Western Australia.
