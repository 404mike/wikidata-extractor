The tournament opened with a 1\u20131 draw with Switzerland, during which Gascoigne was substituted. He scored in England\u2019s second game of the tournament, against Scotland (where he was playing at club level at the time). Receiving the ball from Darren Anderton outside the Scotland penalty area, he flicked the ball over Colin Hendry with his left foot and changed direction; Hendry was completely wrong-footed and, as the ball dropped, Gascoigne volleyed it with his right foot past Andy Goram to seal a 2\u20130 victory.
