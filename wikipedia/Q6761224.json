Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They saw each other at the Gisborne household regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December he went back to Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely."]}, {"page": "Adonais", "response": ["Shelley regarded Adonais as the \"least imperfect\" of his works.

She had more difficulty with these Lives than with the other volumes' biographies, writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: \"I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish & Portugeeze  Lives \u2013 This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, & the difficulty of getting books & information\".Qtd. in Vargo, xix. According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor of the Spanish and Portuguese Lives, Spanish books were hard to come by in England and not much was known regarding Shelley's subjects.Vargo, xix. However, Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: \"The best is that the very thing which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting \u2013 namely \u2013 the treading in unknown paths & dragging out unknown things \u2013 I wish I could go to Spain.\" While living in Harrow, she refused to go to the British Library in London, writing: \"I would not if I could \u2013 I do not like finding myself a stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating  to their own\".Qtd. in Vargo, xx. At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of \"feminist protest\" others see it as \"matter of comfort and practicality\", since the reading rooms were \"noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated\".Vargo, xx. Shelley's continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that \"there is always a sense of an engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what seems accurate\".Vargo, xxii. Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by people who knew the authors, and when translations of the authors' works were unavailable or poor, she provided her own.Vargo, xxvi\u2013xxvii."]}, {"page": "A Philosophical View of Reform", "response": ["It was during this unstable political period in England in late 1819 when Shelley started writing A Philosophical View of Reform.
