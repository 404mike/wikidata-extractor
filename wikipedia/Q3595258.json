He was a prolific writer and artist and filled 52,000 manuscript pages with notes and sketches concerning all aspects of Indian life, its wildlife, flora and architecture. In 1781 he visited the Taj Mahal and became one of the first Europeans to draw it. \nAfter returning to England he married and toured continental Europe extensively, including a grand tour in 1796 and 1797 of Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. He eventually returned to England to write  Oriental Memoirs. Largely based on his notes and sketches, it was subtitled selected and abridged from a series of familiar letters written during seventeen years residence in India: including observations on parts of Africa and South America, and a narrative of occurrences in four India voyages was published in volumes beginning in 1813. The book remains a valued record of the culture, flora and fauna of India at the time. \nForbes also published a work in 1810 which advocated the conversion of Hindus to Christianity. The city of Forbesganj in Araria District in the state of Bihar is named after him. He used to live in the place called Sultan pokhar (pond), and the house in which he lived still stands at the compound . The Area around his house was called Residential area, in short form R-Area, which gradually over time, mixing with the local tongue, changed into Araria *R-Area.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Forbes", "response": ["* James Forbes (statesman) (c. 1731\u20131780), U.S. statesman, Continental Congressman for Maryland", "* James Forbes (basketball) (born 1952), U.S. basketball player, Olympic medalist", "* James Forbes (hospital inspector) (1779\u20131837), Scottish inspector-general of army hospitals", "* James Forbes, 17th Lord Forbes (1765\u20131843), Scottish colonel", "* James Forbes-Robertson (1884\u20131955), English recipient of the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I", "* James Forbes (divine) (c. 1629\u20131712), Scottish nonconformist minister", "* James Forbes (minister) (1813\u20131851), Australian clergyman and educator", "* James Forbes, 16th Lord Forbes (died 1804), Scottish nobleman", "* James Forbes (artist) (1749\u20131819), British artist ", "* James Forbes (botanist) (1773\u20131861), British gardener and botanist", "* James Forbes (portrait painter) (1797\u20131881), Scottish-American portrait painter", "* James Forbes (playwright) (1871\u20131938), Canadian-American writer", "* James Forbes (storekeeper) (1828\u20131906), early Western Australian settler"]}, {"page": "Kankaria Lake", "response": ["British artist James Forbes visited Ahmadabad in 1781 after the fall of Mughal Empire when Ahmedabad was under Maratha rule. He found the gardens at lake neglected, the summer-palace in ruins and the bridge with 48 stone arches connecting Nagina Baug island to the bank in dilapidated condition. He specially noted a species of palmyra in the Nagina Baug which is very uncommon. The tree grows in a straight stem very high and then spreading several branches with a tuft of spreading leaves at the end of each branch. It is still there. After a century, when Ahmedabad was under the British rule, the Kankaria lake was restored by the Collector of the district, Borradalle in 1872. A  road was built from the Raipur gate to the lake. The high banks of the lake were organised and the trees were planted on them. Of the original arched bridge, a small portion was restored and the rest of length is made with earthen bank. In the island, the steps were restored on all four sides, the ancient well was cleared out, the fountain and the pleasure house were restored. the new pierced parapet wall built. In 1879, it was proposed to connect the lake with Khari river by 11 miles long canal and supply water to Chandola lake but it never materialised."]}, {"page": "Thomas Daniell", "response": ["*James Forbes (artist)"]}, {"page": "Black tiger", "response": ["In 1773, while in the service of British East India Company in Kerala, southwest India, artist James Forbes painted a watercolor of a black tiger shot a few months earlier by the poachers.
