Two minutes in, Holdsworth made a run down the right and passed to Barness whose shot was too high.  A minute later, a weak effort from Rankine was easily saved by Clarke.  Preston began to exert pressure on Bolton with Healy in particular causing problems.  In the 62nd minute, Farrelly passed to Holdsworth whose shot into the bottom left-hand corner was saved by Lucas.  Three minutes later, an effort from Rankine went wide of the Bolton goal.  Preston then made the first substitution of the game, with Iain Anderson coming on to replace Cartwright.  In the 68th minute, Healy was denied by Clarke in the Bolton goal with a save low to his left.  Bolton made their first change in the 70th minute, Hansen being substituted for Ricketts, with Allardyce changing his team's formation to a more defensive 4\u20134\u20132 from 4\u20133\u20133.  Nine minutes later, Robbie Elliott came on in place of Frandsen for Bolton and in the 82nd minute, Preston made their second substitution, with Cresswell replacing McKenna.  Two minutes later Clarke punched away a Healy cross to concede a corner from which Cresswell failed to capitalise from close range on a missed clearance.  On 86 minutes, Ricketts hit the side netting with a shot and Preston responded with Sean Gregan striking over the Bolton bar.  In the 89th minute, Ricketts doubled Bolton's lead, taking the ball from Farrelly, rounding the goalkeeper and passing into an empty net.  In the first minute of injury time, Mike Whitlow came on for Bolton to replace Holdsworth, before Gardner increased their lead.  He dispossessed Alexander in the Bolton half, went past a tiring Colin Murdock, and scored, making it 3\u20130 and securing Bolton's promotion to the Premier League.", "|MF ||31 ||Iain Anderson || || "]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|21 ||  Iain Anderson || Dundee || 27 || Free Transfer"]}, {"page": "1995 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF||?|| Iain Anderson || "]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|21 ||  Iain Anderson || Preston North End || 26 || Free Transfer"]}, {"page": "Iain Anderson", "response": ["Iain Anderson may refer to:", "* Iain Anderson (cricketer) (born 1960), former English cricketer", "* Iain Anderson (footballer) (born 1977), former professional footballer"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 St Mirren F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Iain Anderson"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|31||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Iain Anderson"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|31||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Iain Anderson"]}]}}
