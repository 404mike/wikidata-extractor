He accordingly encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion, again writing to his son Michael that \"the only cure for sagging of fainting faith is Communion.\" He believed the Catholic Church to be true most of all because of the pride of place and the honour in which it holds the Blessed Sacrament.

Tolkien is, he wrote, modern but not modernist, at least as well-educated as the critics (another thing that made them feel threatened), and not ironic (especially about his writing). The Lord of the Rings is equally \"a story told by a master story-teller; a story inspired by philology; a story suffused with Catholic values; and a mythic (or mythopoeic) story with a North European pagan inflection\".
