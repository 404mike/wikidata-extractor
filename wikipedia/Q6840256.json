The Cricketers' Who's Who 2011 stated \"Grayson is a progressive coach with sound, modern methods to dealing with today's players. Approachable, reasonable, and quietly authoritative, his coaching style leans on his experiences as a Yorkshire player, and latterly as a canny left-arm spinping allrounder with the county he now coaches\". He often talked on BBC Radio Essex during County Championship and CB40 games. \nGrayson left Essex by mutual consent in August 2015.On 30 September 2015 it was announced he would be joining Durham MCC University as their new coach.On 3 February 2017, Grayson was appointed as coach of Yorkshire Diamonds, on a two year contract.
