The fourth and youngest son of the 2nd Baron Wenlock, he attended Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, before joining the military. Serving in the Mahdist War, he reached the rank of captain before resigning his commission to pursue other interests. Lawley was then private secretary to his uncle, the 1st Duke of Westminster, and subsequently to the 4th Earl Grey, who he followed to Rhodesia.\nRepresenting the British South Africa Company, Lawley was Administrator of Matabeleland from 1896 to 1901, during the conclusion of the Second Matabele War. He was then Governor of Western Australia for a brief period, from 1901 to 1902, before returning to Africa to serve as Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal (under Viscount Milner, the governor). The Transvaal had been incorporated into the empire following the Second Boer War, and Lawley bore much of the responsibility for administrating the colony, remaining lieutenant-governor until 1905. The following year, he was made Governor of Madras, serving until 1911 and overseeing the reform of the Madras Legislative Council. Prominent in the Red Cross during the First World War, Lawley succeeded the youngest of his brothers as Baron Wenlock in 1931, but died a year later. His only son had died in a hunting accident in 1909, and the title consequently became extinct upon his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1932", "response": ["* June 14 \u2013 Arthur Lawley, 6th Baron Wenlock, British colonial administrator (b. 1860)"]}, {"page": "Wenlock", "response": ["** Arthur Lawley, 6th Baron Wenlock (1860\u20131932)"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Dawson", "response": ["George Geoffrey Dawson (25 October 1874 \u2013 7 November 1944) was editor of The Times from 1912 to 1919 and again from 1923 until 1941.
