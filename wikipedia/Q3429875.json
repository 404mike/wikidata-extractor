The character is introduced in the premiere episode as the co-habiting boyfriend of principal character Gwen Cooper. Initially a recurring character, Rhys' role is increased after the second series; actor Kai Owen is given star billing from the show's third series \u2014 a five-part serial subtitled Torchwood: Children of Earth \u2014 onwards. The character has gone on to appear in expanded universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks, comic books and radio plays.\nThroughout the first series (2006), Rhys is initially unaware of Gwen's vocation as a Torchwood agent, believing her to work in generic special forces. Gwen's relationship with Rhys languishes while she is unable to communicate fully with him, but in the early part of series two (2008) he discovers the truth, and from then on in their relationship is revitalised; the two enter a marriage based on honesty later in the series. In the third series (2009) Rhys becomes directly involved in assisting the Torchwood team in lieu of a fourth team member. In the show's fourth series \u2014 a 2011 BBC/Starz co-production \u2014 Rhys again finds himself having to assist Torchwood, though he would rather live a domestic life with Gwen and their daughter Anwen.\nThe original intention of the writers had been to kill off Rhys at the end of the first series, but series creator Russell T Davies found it necessary to keep the show grounded through Rhys as Gwen evolved as a character. Producer Richard Stokes stated that \"without him, it simply becomes a sci-fi show about sci-fi people, running around and hunting aliens.\" Following from the first series the production team decided to make Rhys less of a \"sap\" whilst continuing to use him as a contrast to Torchwood's activities and its charismatic leader Jack Harkness. Whilst early response to the character was mixed \u2014 the character was parodied as \"Barry Backstory\" \u2014 subsequent reviews praised the character's larger role in later episodes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Big Finish Productions", "response": ["Two TV spin-offs from the Doctor Who universe have been continued in audio form by Big Finish: Torchwood and Class which has featured the return of several characters from the original cast: Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori), Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), Rhys Williams (Kai Owen), Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Suzie Costello (Indira Varma), Captain John Hart (James Marsters) and Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin) have all reprised their roles in Torchwood.

Verity Stob, a technology columnist for online newspaper The Register, wrote a parody of Torchwood called Under Torch Wood. The piece is in the style of Under Milk Wood, a Dylan Thomas radio play. The piece comments on the level of swearing present in Torchwood and the role of Rhys Williams, whom the piece describes as \"Barry Backstory\". In its third series, the Doctor Who parody Nebulous also began to parody Torchwood, with references to \"baby dinosaurs falling through a hole in time\" and \"the sheer amount of paranormal activity in the Cardiff area alone\u00a0... starting to threaten the Earth's plausibility shield\"."]}, {"page": "Gwen Cooper", "response": ["Despite being promoted as the show's heart and moral conscience, the flaws in Gwen's own morality are explored throughout the series; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish. The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode \"Countrycide\" was deliberately structured in order to make the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life. For Davies, the dalliance is a \"human\" one, told in an adult manner characterised by \"lust and anger and hurt and the joy you get out of the initial stages of having an affair\". Myles commented that Gwen's compromised morality, as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience, and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were \"safe\" from temptation. Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character. Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate, Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a \"one-dimensional paragon of virtue\". Instead, the writers made Gwen more \"realistic\" by giving her \"distinct human failings\", which Walker felt made her \"arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars\". He identified these failures as her \"tendency towards egotism\", \"self-righteousness\", and \"selfishness\", evident in her \"highly questionable treatment\" of boyfriend Rhys Williams. Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example, as well as the scene in \"Combat\" where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won't remember."]}, {"page": "Senedd building", "response": ["The Doctor Who episode \"The Lazarus Experiment\" was filmed in the Senedd building, along with the ending of \"The Almost People\" as was the Doctor Who spin-off programme Torchwood, which used the Senedd building in the episode \"Meat\", where Gwen Cooper and Rhys Williams sit on the steps of the Senedd building."]}, {"page": "Owen Harper", "response": ["Owen is introduced in the first episode of Torchwood in 2006, as the sarcastic and womanising medical officer for Torchwood Three; the first episode sees him recreationally use alien technology to get a woman and her boyfriend to sleep with him. Owen's first centric episode comes in \"Ghost Machine\", when an alien device makes him experience the rape and murder of a girl in the 1950s, which drives him to seek revenge for her. The next episode sees him kiss teammate Gwen (Eve Myles) in the midst of a Cyberman attack on the Hub, and as the series continues they continue a destructive affair which Gwen conceals from boyfriend Rhys Williams (Kai Owen). Owen remains oblivious to the devotion of teammate Toshiko (Naoko Mori), but experiences real love with a time-lost 1953 pilot Diane (Louise Delamere) and is distraught when she disappears in an attempt to return to her time, and despondent over this, Owen ends the affair with Gwen. Owen investigates a men's 'fight club' which uses alien Weevils, and Owen attempts to allow one to almost devour him; in the episode's d\u00e9nouement, however, Torchwood's captive Weevil mysteriously cowers in fear from Owen. When Captain Jack (John Barrowman) and Toshiko are lost to the past, Owen as second-in-command takes control and fights with Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) over whether to open the Rift and 'rescue them'; Owen truly intends to rescue Diane, and is successful in opening the Rift and saving his teammates, but with consequences, for which Jack fires him. In the series finale, the opened Rift causes global chaos. An apparition of Diane sent by Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin) convinces Owen to lead a mutiny against Jack to open the Rift yet again; Owen goes so far as to shoot Jack twice in the head.
