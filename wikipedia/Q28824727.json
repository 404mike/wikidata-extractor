He then returned to non-league football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Neal", "response": ["Neal signed a two-year contract with League One club Fleetwood Town in May 2016, and joined the club shortly after the departure of Chris Maxwell. He was named in the EFL team of the week after keeping a second successive clean sheet in a 2\u20130 win over Coventry City on 3 September. However he lost his first team place to Alex Cairns in November; manager Uwe R\u00f6sler admitted that the situation was a \"little bit harsh on Chris Neal because Chris Neal did nothing wrong\" and it was Cairns's strong form that made him undroppable. On 6 January 2018, he kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw with Leicester City in the Third Round of the FA Cup, and was rewarded with a year's supply of pizza from sponsors Papa John's Pizza. He was released by manager John Sheridan upon the expiry of his contract at Highbury Stadium at the end of the 2017\u201318 season."]}, {"page": "Chris Neal (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Chris Neal (footballer, born 1947), English winger who played for Darlington", "*Chris Neal (born 1985), English footballer who plays for Salford City", "*Chris Neal (songwriter) (born 1946), Australian musician", "*Chris Neal, pseudonym of Daniel Knauf, American television and comic book writer"]}]}}
