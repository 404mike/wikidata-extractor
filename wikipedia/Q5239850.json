He is known for his festal masses, which are preserved in two early-16th-century choirbooks, the Caius Choirbook at Caius College, Cambridge, and the Lambeth Choirbook at Lambeth Palace, London. His surviving antiphons, all incomplete, are copied in the Peterhouse Partbooks (Henrican set). Ludford is well-known as being the composer of the only surviving cycle of Lady Masses, small-scale settings of the Ordinary and Propers in three parts to be sung in the smaller chapels of religious institutions on each day of the week. Ludford's composing career, which appears to have ended in 1535, is seen as bridging the gap between the music of Robert Fayrfax  and that of John Taverner (1495\u20131545).Skinner, 1993. Music scholar David Skinner has called Ludford \"one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony\".Skinner, 1993. In his Oxford History of English Music, John Caldwell observes of Ludford's six-part Mass and Magnificat Benedicta that it \"is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times\".Caldwell, p. 219.", "Ludford's work seems to have extended outside St Stephen's in this period. In 1533 he was paid by St Margaret's for a choirbook, probably containing his own compositions and those by a composer he much admired, Robert Fayrfax. There were about six choirbooks in use around Westminster in this period and it has even been suggested by David Skinner that Ludford may have been partly responsible for the creation of the Caius Choirbook, which contains five Magnificats and ten Masses. ", "The few contemporary references to Ludford suggest that he was a private and highly religious man. He was not renowned in his own day, and his work cannot be identified with any of the major events of the time.Skinner, 1993. In 1597, the Elizabethan composer Thomas Morley (c. 1557\u20131602), in his Introduction to Practicall Music, noted Ludford as an \"authority\"; but in the 17th century Ludford's music was neglected and finally forgotten.Skinner, 1993. In 1913, scholar H B. Collins drew attention to Ludford, whose unpublished masses were then being sung by the choir of Westminster Cathedral under Sir Richard Terry. In the 1960s and 1970s, scholar John Bergsagel published Ludford's complete Masses and wrote commentaries on his work.Skinner, 1993. The first recordings of Ludford's works, in editions by David Skinner, were made in 1993\u201395 by The Cardinall's Musick under Andrew Carwood. Significant recorded additions since include the Gramophone-award winning disc by New College Choir, Oxford, which includes the Missa Benedicta and the votive antiphons Ave Cuius Conceptio and Domine Jesu Christe. This is the only recording to feature trebles and is a wonderful recreation of how Ludford's music might have sounded.", "*David Skinner, \u2018At the Mynde of Nicholas Ludford: New Light on Ludford from the Churchwardens\u2019 Accounts of St Margaret\u2019s, Westminster\u2019, Early Music, vol. 22 (1994)"]}, {"page": "Alamire (consort)", "response": ["Alamire is an English vocal consort specialising in medieval and Renaissance music, both secular and religious.
