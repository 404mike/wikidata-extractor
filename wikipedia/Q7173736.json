He was the sixth son of Charles Drelincourt, minister of the reformed church in Paris, and graduated M.A. at Trinity College, Dublin, 1681, and LL.D. 1691.Having been appointed chaplain to the Duke of Ormonde, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, he became in 1681 precentor of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin; in 1683 Archdeacon of Leighlin; and 28 February 1690\u20131 Dean of Armagh, retaining his archdeaconry, and holding at the same time the rectory of Armagh. He was buried in the Armagh Cathedral, where a fine monument by Rysbrack was erected by his widow to his memory. On a mural tablet, in Latin, is a minute account of his origin and promotions, and on the front of the sarcophagus an inscription in English verse. It alludes to the erection in Armagh of the \"Drelincourt Charity School\" by the dean's widow, Mary. To their daughter, Viscountess Primrose, the citizens of Armagh are chiefly indebted for a plentiful supply of water.\nDrelincourt's only publication is A Speech made to \u2026 the Duke of Ormonde, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and to the \u2026 Privy Council. To return the humble thanks of the French Protestants lately arriv'd in this kingdom; and graciously reliev'd by them, 4to, Dublin, 1682.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1644", "response": ["* July 22 \u2013 Peter Drelincourt, Irish chaplain (d. 1722)"]}, {"page": "Drelincourt", "response": ["** Peter Drelincourt (1644-1722), Dean of Armagh"]}, {"page": "Dean of Armagh", "response": ["*1690/1\u20131722 Peter Drelincourt"]}]}}
