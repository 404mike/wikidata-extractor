Cole was forced to retire from professional football in 2011 as a result of a deteriorating heart condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, that meant it was dangerous for him to continue playing competitive football.\nCole started his career in the academy at West Ham United. He was released in 2004 and joined Grays Athletic. During his first season with Grays, the club won the Conference South title, as well as the FA Trophy. He joined Southend United in 2005, spending a year-and-a-half at the club before signing for Stevenage Borough for an undisclosed fee in January 2007. He scored in the first ever competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium as Stevenage won the FA Trophy in May 2007; also winning the trophy again in May 2009. He helped Stevenage earn promotion to the Football League for the first time in their history during the 2009\u201310 campaign, finishing the season as Conference Premier champions.\nIn June 2010, Cole signed for League Two club Oxford United, playing six times before retiring from professional football in February 2011 due to a heart condition. Ahead of the 2011\u201312 season, Cole joined Stotfold and played twice for them.

Six minutes into the second-half, Stevenage halved the deficit, Morison headed the ball down to Mitchell Cole, who produced a neat right-footed finish to beat Scott Bevan in the Kidderminster goal. Centre-back Santos Gaia spurned the opportunity to restore parity when his header narrowly missed the target on the hour mark. Stimson brought on Craig Dobson in place of Steve Guppy after 63 minutes, and ten minutes later, Dobson levelled the scores at two-apiece. Dobson latched on to a \"hopeful long punt\" from John Nutter and toe poked the ball past onrushing Bevan. Kidderminster responded by making an instant change, bringing on Andrew White for Iyseden Christie. However, it was Stevenage who would go on to complete a remarkable comeback with just two minutes of the game remaining. Stevenage right-back Barry Fuller produced a swinging cross that Morison hooked towards goal on the volley, Bevan saved the shot, but Morison reacted fastest to \"smash home the rebound and snatch the glory\".", "After the match, the Kidderminster players and management team were the first to make the 107\u2013step climb up the Wembley stairs to collect their runners-up medals.

In the post-match interviews, Kidderminster manager Mark Yates stated he was \"devastated, but proud\" of his players, and believed his side did not deserve to lose the match. Stevenage's manager Mark Stimson, celebrating his third consecutive FA Trophy success, told the players to \"believe in themselves\" at half-time, and felt that his side were always going to go on and win the match once Mitchell Cole had halved the two-goal deficit just after half-time.
