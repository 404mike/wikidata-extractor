The winners of the replay were given a potential televised home match against Premier League side Everton in the FA Cup fourth round. On 16 January, Yeovil faced Morecambe. Yeovil had an early chance to take the lead but midfielder Matthew Dolan saw an eighth-minute penalty saved by keeper Barry Roche, despite the miss the Glovers took the lead through captain Darren Ward's first goal for the club, but the lead only lasted five minutes as Yeovil lost the match 2\u20131. Yeovil's next match saw them face Carlisle United in their third round replay, a match deemed to be worth over \u00a3200,000 to the winner. Yeovil took the lead in the first half through Jack Compton's first goal of the club before Antony Sweeney headed in a late equaliser. Following that equaliser a brawl broke out between the two sets of players but despite Carlisle striker Jabo Ibehre \"clotheslining\" Yeovil keeper Artur Krysiak, the striker escaped with just a yellow card. With the game deep into injury time in the second half Yeovil earned a penalty but striker Fran\u00e7ois Zoko missed to send the game into extra time, the 30 minutes of extra time saw no further goals but two red cards with defender Alex Lacey receiving a red card for a studs-up tackle while Carlisle's Luke Joyce was dismissed for a second bookable offence. The game finished 1\u20131 after extra time and went to a penalty shoot-out, after eight successful kicks Matthew Dolan saw his penalty saved, for the second match in a row, to allow Mark Ellis to score to send Carlisle through to play Everton in the fourth round. After the game, the club confirmed that Ivorian striker Zoko had signed a new contract until the end of the season. On 23 January, Yeovil faced Crawley Town and thanks to goals from substitutes Tahvon Campbell and Ryan Bird won 2\u20131 to record their second consecutive home victory. The following week, striker Mark Beck departed the club on loan to National League side Wrexham until the end of the season, Bournemouth winger Harry Cornick having recovered from his injury rejoined the club on an initial one-month loan deal and West Brom loanee Tahvon Campbell extended his loan until 3 March. Yeovil ended the month with a trip to AFC Wimbledon and despite falling behind twice in the first half a hat-trick from winger Jack Compton earned Yeovil a 3\u20132 victory. The hat-trick was the first by a Yeovil player since Shaun MacDonald in March 2011, while the game also featured the return of Simon Gillett after more than year out through injury.
