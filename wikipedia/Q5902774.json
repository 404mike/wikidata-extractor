On one occasion, in 1831 at Newmarket, he rode  in 8 hours and 42 minutes, using 28 horses. On another occasion he wagered 100 guineas with Paul Methuen that he could drive a stage-coach from St. Paul's churchyard to Greenwich in an hour with a full complement of passengers. Osbaldeston won his bet, although the coach was loaded with a number of hefty Life-Guardsmen and despite being sent back from the bottom of Ludgate Hill for a false start. His last race was at the age of 69, and he also bred racehorses.", "Of his brilliant beginning and impoverished end, his great friend and rival Horatio Ross commented, \"He was open-hearted and trusted others; he was constantly deceived and robbed, and when his affairs were getting into confusion, he had not the moral nerve to pull up in time; nor had he a sufficiently business-head on his shoulders to guide him safely out of his troubles.\""]}, {"page": "Patrick Chalmers (MP)", "response": ["He was the son of another Patrick Chalmers, a merchant from Aldbar, from whom he inherited Aldbar Castle.
