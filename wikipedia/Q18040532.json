The land changed hands several times before ending up in the possession of James Carruthers, a wealthy grain merchant from Montreal in 1905. At this time, the city ended at the ravine where Groat Road is now. Carruthers wanted to develop the area as a residential neighbourhood but transportation for commuters was clearly a problem. In 1909 he reached an agreement with the City of Edmonton to build a bridge across the ravine in exchange for the City guaranteeing to extend streetcar service to the area. The City wanted a  bridge, but eventually settled for a 20-foot bridge and a donation of land. The Carruthers bridge, finished in 1910 now carries 102 Avenue across the ravine, and marked the beginning of the development of the area.http://www.kerrilynholland.com/page_content-11.html The bridge made possible the construction of the new official mansion for the lieutenant--governors of Alberta, Government House which began which was completed in 1913. The 1913 Edmonton real estate crash slowed development substantially, but the local elite wanted to live close to the governor's mansion, and near the view of the river valley and with good connections to the streetcar system. As is typical all across the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, in Alberta the winds are more often west-to-east than vice versa, and the \"West End\" (which included Glenora) had much better air quality than the east, which partially explains why Glenora is a \"posh\" neighbourhood while Boyle Street, a streetcar suburb of the same vintage to the east of Downtown Edmonton, is low income, much like the contrast between the West and East Ends of London, England."]}, {"page": "James Carruthers (historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Carruthers"]}, {"page": "Carruthers, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Carruthers"]}]}}
