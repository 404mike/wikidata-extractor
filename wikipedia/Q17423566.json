Thomas Morris had served in the 17th Foot regiment, as had his father (who commanded it under the Duke of Marlborough during the War of the Spanish Succession). Morris senior is generally credited as being the author of the song, Kitty Crowder. In 1764 Charles Morris gained an ensigncy in the regiment and was later promoted to captain whilst serving in America. After he returned to Ireland, he transferred to the Royal Irish Dragoons and His Majesty's Life Guards as he wanted to live in London.On 14 February 1785 Morris became punchmaker and bard of the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks, a famous society limited to 24 members. He held the position until 1831.He performed after Club dinners at Covent Garden Theatre. Politically he was a Whig associated with Charles James Fox.On 8 February 1773 he married the widow of Sir William Stanhope (a son of Lord Chesterfield), Anne Hussey Delaval (1737-1812).His older brother was Captain Thomas Morris (1732?-1808), who served in the British Army in America, and was himself a noted writer in his day.\nCharles Morris died at Brockham Lodge, near Dorking in Surrey, a home given to him by his patron the Duke of Norfolk. He was in his 93rd year.\nIn 1840 a collection of his poetry, which he had assembled himself, was published as Lyrica Urbanica (or The Social Effusions of the Celebrated Captain Charles Morris of the Late Lifeguards) in two volumes. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Morris", "response": ["* Charles Morris (surveyor general) (1711\u20131781), Canadian army officer, officeholder, and judge", "* Charles Morris (naval officer) (1784\u20131856), US naval administrator and officer", "* Charles Morris (1731\u20131802), Canadian surveyor, judge and political figure in Nova Scotia", "* Charles Morris (1759\u20131831), Canadian surveyor and political figure in Nova Scotia", "* Charles Morris (Australian politician) (1863\u20131918), Member of South Australian Legislative Council", "* Charles Morris (British politician) (1926\u20132012), British MP for Manchester, Openshaw", "* Charles Morris, Baron Morris of Grasmere (1898\u20131990), British philosopher and life peer", "* Charles Morris (legal educator) (21st century), American professor of law emeritus at Southern Methodist University School of Law", "* Charles Morris (boxer) (1879\u20131959), British Olympic medalist 1908", "* Charles Morris (cricketer, born 1880) (1880\u20131947), English cricketer", "* Charles Morris (athlete) (born 1915), British Olympian racewalker", "* Charles Morris (cricketer, born 1939), English cricketer", "* Charles Morris (cricketer, born 1992), English cricketer", "* Charles Morris (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1840), New Zealand cricketer", "* Charles Morris (American writer) (1833\u20131922), American writer of dime novels", "* Charles Morris (poet) (1745\u20131838), British poet", "* Charles Morris, author and host of the Haven Today radio program from 2000 to present"]}, {"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["Jean Adams \u2013 Joseph Addison \u2013 John Aikin \u2013 Mark Akenside \u2013 Mary Alcock \u2013 Robert Andrews \u2013 Christopher Anstey \u2013 John Armstrong \u2013 Joanna Baillie \u2013 Henry Baker \u2013 John Codrington Bampfylde \u2013 John Bancks \u2013 Anna Laetitia Barbauld \u2013 Mary Barber \u2013 James Beattie \u2013 George Berkeley \u2013 Isaac Bickerstaffe \u2013 Samuel Bishop \u2013 James Bisset \u2013 Robert Blair \u2013 William Blake \u2013 Susanna Blamire \u2013 Samuel Bowden \u2013 William Lisle Bowles \u2013 James Bramston \u2013 Andrew Brice \u2013 Henry Brooke \u2013 John Brown \u2013 Isaac Hawkins Browne \u2013 Moses Browne \u2013 Michael Bruce \u2013 John Frederick Bryant \u2013 Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges \u2013 Robert Burns \u2013 John Byrom \u2013 George Canning \u2013 Henry Carey \u2013 John Carr \u2013 James Cawthorn \u2013 Thomas Chatterton \u2013 Edward Chicken \u2013 Lady Mary Chudleigh \u2013 Charles Churchill \u2013 Colley Cibber \u2013 Thomas Cole \u2013 John Collier \u2013 Mary Collier \u2013 Emanuel Collins \u2013 William Collins \u2013 George Colman the younger \u2013 William Congreve \u2013 Joseph Cottle \u2013 William Cowper \u2013 George Crabbe \u2013 William Crowe \u2013 Samuel Croxall \u2013 John Cunningham \u2013 Sir George Dallas \u2013 John Dalton \u2013 James Dance \u2013 Erasmus Darwin \u2013 Sneyd Davies \u2013 Daniel Defoe \u2013 William Diaper \u2013 Charles Dibdin \u2013 Sarah Dixon \u2013 John Dobson \u2013 Philip Doddridge \u2013 Robert Dodsley \u2013 E.
