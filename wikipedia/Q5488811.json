But then I was 19, 20 years old, and at university, so everything was exciting, really.\" Muldoon was not a strong student at Queen's. He recalls: \"I had stopped. Really, I should have dropped out. I'd basically lost interest halfway through. Not because there weren't great people teaching me, but I'd stopped going to lectures, and rather than doing the decent thing, I just hung around\".
