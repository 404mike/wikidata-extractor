From 1956, his roles grew smaller, although his later film appearances did include four for noted director Michael Powell as well as a small role in a Bond movie, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mordred", "response": ["Virtually everywhere Mordred appears, his name is synonymous with treason. He appears in Dante's Inferno in the lowest circle of Hell, set apart for traitors: \"him who, at one blow, had chest and shadow / shattered by Arthur's hand\" (Canto XXXII).Inferno, Canto XXXII, lines 61\u201362 (Mandelbaum translation). Mordred is especially prominent in popular modern era Arthurian literature, as well as in film, television, and comics.Torregrossa, Michael A., \"Will the 'Reel' Mordred Please Stand Up? Strategies for Representing Mordred in American and British Arthurian Film\" in Cinema Arthuriana: Twenty Essays (Rev. edn.), ed. Kevin J. Harty. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2002 (pb. 2009), pp. 199\u2013210. He has been portrayed on screen by Leonard Penn (The Adventures of Sir Galahad 1949), Brian Worth (The Adventures of Sir Lancelot 1956\u20131957), David Hemmings (Camelot 1967), Robert Addie (Excalibur 1981), Nickolas Grace (Morte d'Arthur 1984), Simon Templeman (The Legend of Prince Valiant 1991\u20131994), Jason Done (Merlin 1998), Craig Sheffer\u00a0(Merlin: The Return 2000), Hans Matheson (The Mists of Avalon 2001), and Asa Butterfield and Alexander Vlahos (Merlin 2008\u20132012), among others. In such modern adaptations, Morgause is often conflated with (and into) the character of Morgan le Fay, who may be Mordred's mother or alternatively his lover or wife. A few works of the Middle Ages and today, however, portray Mordred as less a traitor and more a conflicted opportunist, or even a victim of fate.The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 394. Even Malory, who depicts Mordred as a villain, notes that the people rallied to him because, \"with Arthur was none other life but war and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss.\""]}, {"page": "Ask a Policeman", "response": ["* Brian Worth - Broadcasting Engineer"]}, {"page": "The Lion Has Wings", "response": ["*Brian Worth as Bobby"]}, {"page": "On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)", "response": ["* Brian Worth as Manuel (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "The Square Peg", "response": ["* Brian Worth as Henri Le Blanc"]}, {"page": "Cardboard Cavalier", "response": ["* Brian Worth as Tom Pride"]}, {"page": "Bryan Worth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Worth"]}, {"page": "Worth, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Worth"]}, {"page": "Brian Worth (actor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Worth"]}, {"page": "Francis Storm Investigates", "response": ["* Brian Worth as Francis Storm"]}]}}
