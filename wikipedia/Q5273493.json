Dick first played for Lancashire in 1919 and, with Dean out of form and Cook still in the Army, gained a regular place as a slow bowler. Though he kept a perfect length and could flight the ball extremely well, at this early stage Tyldesley had so little spin that he was not a deadly force on sticky wickets. He also showed promise as a hard-hitting batsman and demonstrated his ability as a close-catching field.By 1921, he was one of the leading bowlers for Lancashire, and in 1922, gaining more spin on the ball on sticky wickets, Dick Tyldesley took 100 first-class wickets. He also hit up 105 against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford and remarkably was Lancashire's fourth-highest run-scorer - though with less than half the aggregates of Ernest Tyldesley, Hallows and Makepeace. It was from 1923, however, that he leaped to the top of the tree though increasing his finger spin to make him a deadly bowler on the many sticky pitches found in the North. He took 140 wickets that year, and in 1924 - a summer so wet that only one Lancashire match was played throughout on a pitch unaffected by rain - he was consistently deadly except against the most exceptionally skilled batsmen.\nHis record that summer won him a place on the Ashes tour of 1924/1925, but he was a dreadful failure on the cast-iron Australian wickets where the ball came straight through. His wickets for the whole tour cost 41 runs apiece - a remarkable contrast to his record in England! However, at home Tyldesley maintained his form as a bowler exceptionally well, and after a slight lapse in 1927 and 1928 he was back at his best in 1929, heading the bowling averages and invariably proving unplayable after showers in a very dry summer. With Australian paceman Ted McDonald, Tyldesley formed a bowling combination that was sufficient to give Lancashire a hat-trick of Championship wins between 1926 and 1928: during these three years McDonald took 484 wickets and Tyldesley 303 - though Tyldesley actually had a better average. As a batsman, though, Dick Tyldesley declined to the point of only making two fifties after 1926.\nIn 1930 Tyldesley took 121 wickets for under 15 each and played a vital role in Lancashire's fourth Championship in five years. He was recalled to the Test side with only moderate success, but remained Lancashire's leading bowler in 1931. Unfortunately, that was to prove his last season of county cricket because of a dispute with the committee. He played for some years in the Lancashire League, as professional for Haslingden (1932), East Lancashire (1933), Accrington (1934\u201335) and Lowerhouse (1936) and was then landlord of the Dog and Pheasant pub at Wingates, Westhoughton. He played one more first-class match, for Sir L Parkinson's XI v Leicestershire, at Blackpool, in 1935. Often viewed as overweight, he died at the young age of forty-six in 1943.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1924 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Bob Catterall, Jack MacBryan, Herbie Taylor, Dick Tyldesley, Dodger Whysall"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Dick Tyldesley"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["After the war Lancashire developed a very strong batting side, including Ernest Tyldesley and Johnny Tyldesley, both Test batsmen. In 1920, Lancashire finished runner up and bowlers Harry Dean and Lawrence Cook took 274\u00a0wickets between them. During 1921, interest in cricket reached an all-time high, with over 250,000 people attending Old Trafford and over 4,500 members. 1922 was a year of contradictions, a strong team winning seven out of fifteen matches by an innings, but still managing to lose seven and finish 5th; that season Cec Parkin and Lawrence Cook mustered 308\u00a0wickets between them and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs. Retrieved on 20\u00a0October 2007. Lancashire's steady progress was capped by a hat trick of championship titles between 1926 and 1928 under the captaincy of Leonard Green. In the 1926 victory, Ernest Tyldesley and Harry Makepeace each scored over 2,000\u00a0runs. In 1927, Charlie Hallows scored six centuries and the bowling attack was led by Dick Tyldesley and Ted McDonald with support from Frank Sibbles. In 1928, Frank Watson and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs each and George Duckworth claimed 107 victims and earned recognition as one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year. At the end of the season Leonard Green decided to retire with a record of three successive championships and 42 wins against just three defeats. Retrieved on 20\u00a0October 2007.", "Under the captaincy of Peter Eckersley, Lancashire finished second in the championship in 1929 and reclaimed the title in 1930, with ten victories and no defeats that season. After four titles in five seasons, the early 1930s saw a number of retirements including McDonald and Dick Tyldesley in 1931 and Ernest Tyldesley in 1935: no Lancashire batsman has matched Tyldesley's 100\u00a0centuries in first-class cricket. Lancashire won the championship outright for the last time in 1934, the same year that Len Hopwood performed the double of 1,000\u00a0runs and 100\u00a0wickets (a feat he repeated in 1935) and Cyril Washbrook began to work his way into the team. The captain, Peter Eckersley, retired in 1935 to become an MP. The later half of the 1930s was a period of rebuilding up until the war, with the opening partnership of Cyril Washbrook and Eddie Paynter the highlight. Paynter scored 322 in five hours for Lancashire against Sussex in 1937 having come down on the sleeper train from the victorious Old Trafford Test against New Zealand. He put on 268 in 155 minutes with Cyril Washbrook and celebrated his innings that evening at Brighton's Ice Palace.
