Literature scholar Victoria Holtz-Wodzak calls Ni\u00ebnor a \"study of the lives of women during wartime. She is, for all practical purposes, a war orphan\". She sees the war-time fate of the women in Tolkien's life as well as his own experiences as inspiration for the character and its sympathetic treatment by the author. His wife Edith Tolkien, like N\u00edniel, had to let her husband go to an uncertain fate in combat while pregnant and in precarious circumstances. J. R. R. Tolkien himself, like N\u00edniel, was unable to take part in combat himself for most of World War I due to illness. Holtz-Wodzak also compares his situation to that of Brand\u00edr, who as a non-combatant loses the struggle with Turambar for both the respect of his people and the love of N\u00edniel. The scholar even sees an echo of Tolkien's sentiments about not being able to be active in World War II due to age in \"Niennor's desperate wish either to keep the man she loves from danger or to die with him\"."]}, {"page": "Hornsea", "response": ["*Edith Tolkien (1889\u20131971), wife of J.
