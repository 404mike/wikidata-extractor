Alice studied at St Leonards School in St Andrews, and then at Somerville College, Oxford University.  She became a secondary school teacher, also undertaking research in history in her spare time.In 1913, Enfield began working for the National Federation of Women Workers, focusing on campaigning for better benefits for women under the National Health Insurance scheme.  Four years later, she instead took employment with the Women's Co-operative Guild, as private secretary to Margaret Llewelyn Davies.  Davies retired as secretary of the organisation in 1922, and Enfield replaced her.Enfield was a founder of the International Women's Co-operative Guild in 1921, and became its first secretary, the following year.  The role gradually expanded, and in 1927 she resigned her other posts to work full-time for the international organisation.In her spare time, Enfield was involved in the peace movement, serving on the National Peace Council, and during 1932 on the Disarmament Committee of the International Women's Organisations.  She died in 1935, while visiting Paris in an attempt to organise a women's co-operative guild there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Co-operative Women's Guild", "response": [":1922: Honora Enfield"]}, {"page": "Margaret Llewelyn Davies", "response": ["Davies's election as general secretary was described by Jean Gaffin and David Thoms, authors of Caring & sharing: the centenary history of the Co-operative Women's Guild (1993), as a \"turning point\" in the organization's history; her tenure ushered in an era of unprecedented growth and success for the Guild. Davies was considered such a significant figure in the Guild, and her retirement such a loss, that Catherine Webb began writing The Woman with the Basket, a history of the Guild to that point. Harris retired at the same time as Davies. Neither Davies or Harris had been paid for their work for the Guild, which helped the organisation to remain financially stable even during the period when funding from the central board was suspended.
