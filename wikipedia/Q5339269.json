Indian Viceroy Lord Hardinge asked Duff to make a military assessment as to the feasibility of an operation in Mesopotamia.  Duff decided in short order that it was not possible.  The Ottomans had 15,000 badly armed troops that would grow in numbers.  A single brigade could if careful, take Baghdad, as long as it had friendly Arab support.  He guessed that an occupying force would be at Baghdad for at least a fortnight before river transport could bring reinforcements.  A division might garrison Baghdad, so long as the Russians held down the Turks in Armenia.  His conclusion was that Baghdad was of little military value.  The India Office in London was not keen either.  They were sceptical of being holed up in Basra without action for an occupying force into the interior.  But the talented Indian political department had a whip hand, were a source of information supplied, and impressive to the cabinet.Military Secretary, India Office, minute, 27 November 1914. 'Persian Gulf Operations' But the laws of Order of Precedent applied, so any decision had to be vetted by the Imperial government in London.  The Mesopotamian Campaign was under the responsibility of the Indian Army, but even after Townshend's brilliant capture of Amara he did know where were his strategic objectives.  Falling very sick in summer 1915, he returned to India to recover.  Duff entertained the general advising that on no account could a weakened force advance any further beyond Kut, until made up to \"adequate strength.\"  General Barrow was also present at these Simla meetings.Sir Edmund Barrow, 'The Mesopotamia Question in its Military Aspect', 4 October 1915.  BL IOR L/MIL/5 752. The question remained however that Townshend wanted to retreat - Aziziyeh, was untenable, and in any event his decision concurred with Duff's instructions, not to over-extend supply lines.  Yet the chain of command remained confused: responsibility for reinforcements, which Townshend had refused from Nixon, would later be blamed on the Indian Commander-in-chief."]}, {"page": "Southern Command (India)", "response": ["*Oct 1908 \u2013 Oct 1912 General Sir Edmund Barrow "]}, {"page": "Military Secretary to the India Office", "response": ["*General Sir Edmund Barrow, 1914\u20131917"]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["|||Sir Edmund Barrow||1852||1934||"]}, {"page": "George Lennox Barrow", "response": ["George Lennox Barrow was the youngest son of Major Ronald Barrow, who was originally from a London-based family of military and property owners.
