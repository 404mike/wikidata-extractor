She was employed by the observatory in 1879 at the age of 15, and remained there for 24 years, working under astronomers John Couch Adams and Robert Stawell Ball. She worked most directly with the observatory's senior assistant at the time, Andrew Graham. The observatory necessitated that only two observers worked at any one time. Up until 1892, Walker substituted for Graham's current assistant Henry Todd when Todd's ill health prevented him from observing. That Walker was making transit observations with the meridian circle in the mid-1880s is clear from an observatory report that stated her work was interrupted by an earth tremor on 22 April 1884, when she had to stop while wires in the eyepiece vibrated. From 1892, Walker became Graham's observation partner and from 1894 to 1896, she observed alone.See page 89 in ", "thumb|Photograph of the Cambridge Observatory Transit Circle, taken in April 1896.
