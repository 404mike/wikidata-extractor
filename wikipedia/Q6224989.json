He was educated at Charterhouse and the University of Edinburgh from where he gained a Ph.D. in politics in 1975.His works include biographies of Lloyd George, F. E. Smith, Aneurin Bevan, Roy Jenkins, Edward Heath, and Margaret Thatcher, the last consisting of two volumes, The Grocer's Daughter (2000) and The Iron Lady (2003).  A one-volume abridgment prepared by David Freeman (a historian of Britain teaching at California State University, Fullerton), entitled The Iron Lady: Margaret Thatcher, From Grocer's Daughter to Prime Minister, was published in 2009 and reissued in paperback in 2011. He was awarded the NCR Book Award for his biography of Heath in 1994.\nHe has also written, If Love Were All ... the story of Frances Stevenson & David Lloyd George (2006) and Pistols At Dawn: Two Hundred Years of Political Rivalry from Pitt & Fox to Blair & Brown (2009).\nHis most recent book is the official biography, Roy Jenkins: A Well Rounded Life (Jonathan Cape, March 2014), which was short-listed for the 2014 Samuel Johnson Prize and the 2014 Costa Biography Award, and won the Biography category in the 2014 Political Book Awards.Campbell was consultant to the 2009 production of Margaret, a fictionalisation of Margaret Thatcher's fall from power, and the 2012 film The Iron Lady.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Jenkins", "response": ["Born in Abersychan, Monmouthshire, in southeastern Wales, as an only child, Roy Jenkins was the son of a National Union of Mineworkers official, Arthur Jenkins.

H. Asquith. For Jenkins, Asquith ranked with Attlee as the embodiment of the moderate, liberal intelligence in politics that he most admired. Through Asquith's grandson, Mark Bonham Carter, Jenkins had access to Asquith's letters to his mistress, Venetia Stanley.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 236. Kenneth Rose, Michael Foot, Asa Briggs and John Grigg all favourably reviewed the book when it was published in October 1964.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 239. However, Violet Bonham Carter wrote a defence of her father in The Times against the few criticisms of Asquith in the book,Violet Bonham Carter, 'Asquith Revealed By Events', The Times (2 November 1964), p. 11. and Robert Rhodes James wrote in The Spectator that \"Asquith was surely a tougher, stronger, more acute man...than Mr. Jenkins would have us believe.

However, there were critical voices: John Smith in The Scotsman charged that Jenkins never had any loyalty to the Labour Party and was an ambitious careerist intent only on furthering his career. John Campbell claims that A Life at the Centre is now generally recognised as one of the best political memoirs. David Cannadine ranked it alongside Duff Cooper's Old Men Forget, R. A.

Perhaps Heath's most prominent achievement came in 1973, when he led the United Kingdom into membership of the European Communities popularly known as entry to the Common Market (which would later become the European Union) as a member state. Heath had always been a strong supporter of British membership of the EC, and after winning the decisive vote in the House of Commons by 356 to 244 to join, he led the negotiations that culminated in the UK's entry into the EC on 1 January 1973.

Heath's biographer John Campbell speculates that his speech, unlike that of his father and younger brother, who both spoke with Kent accents, must have undergone \"drastic alteration on encountering Oxford\", although retaining elements of Kent speech.", "The new rules permitted new candidates to enter the ballot in a second round of voting should the first be inconclusive, so Thatcher's challenge was considered by some to be that of a stalking horse.

While acknowledging that Heath was often assumed by the public to be gay, not least because it is \"nowadays\u00a0... whispered of any bachelor\", he found \"no positive evidence\" that this was so \"except for the faintest unsubstantiated rumour\" (the footnote refers to a mention of a \"disturbing incident\" at the beginning of the Second World War in a 1972 biography by Andrew Roth). Campbell ultimately concluded that the most significant aspect of Heath's sexuality was his complete repression of it."]}, {"page": "Norman Tebbit", "response": ["Following Geoffrey Howe's resignation from the government in November 1990, Thatcher asked Tebbit to return to the Cabinet as Education Secretary, but he refused on the grounds that he was looking after his largely crippled wife.Thatcher, p. 835. During the 1990 Conservative leadership election, Tebbit was on Thatcher's campaign team with the job of assessing her support amongst Conservative MPs.Thatcher, p. 846. According to Thatcher's biographer John Campbell, Tebbit was \"her most visible cheerleader...who characteristically took the fight to Heseltine by holding a cheeky press conference on his Belgravia doorstep\".Campbell, p. 724. After the first ballot but before the results became known, Tebbit wanted Thatcher to make a clear commitment to fight the second ballot if her vote fell short of the amount needed to win outright.Campbell, p. 731. When Tebbit saw Thatcher on 21 November he told her she was the candidate with the best chance of beating Heseltine.Thatcher, p. 847. However, Thatcher withdrew from the contest the next day.

Prime Minister Attlee rejected Bevan in favour of Herbert Morrison because he distrusted Bevan\u2019s personality. In his biography of Bevan, John Campbell wrote, \"Bevan's impetuous temperament, undiplomatic tone and reputation as an extreme left-winger combined to make the Foreign Office seem the last place a prudent Prime Minister would think of putting him at any time.

Crossman later acknowledged that they had perjured themselves to do so.Roy Jenkins wrote of his former colleagues (in \"Aneurin Bevan\" in Portraits and Miniatures, 2011) that they \"sailed to victory on the unfortunate combination of Lord Chief Justice Goddard's prejudice against the anti-hanging and generally libertarian Spectator of those days and the perjury of the plaintiffs, subsequently exposed in Crossman's endlessly revealing diaries.\"  Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote (in The Guardian, 18 March 2000, \"Lies and Libel\"): \"Fifteen years later, Crossman boasted (in my presence) that they had indeed all been toping heavily, and that at least one of them had been blind drunk.\" Dominic Lawson wrote (in The Independent, \"Chris Huhne's downfall is another example of the amazing risks a politician will take\". 4 February 2013): \"Crossman's posthumously published diaries revealed that the story was accurate; and in 1978, Brian Inglis on What the Papers Say revealed that Crossman had told him a few days after the case that they had committed perjury\".

Clarke, with backing from John Major, persuaded Thatcher to accept the controversial \"internal market\" concept to the NHS.Campbell, p. 552. Clarke claimed that he had persuaded Thatcher to introduce internal competition in the NHS as an alternative to her preference for introducing a system of compulsory health insurance, which he opposed.", "By 1994 almost all hospitals had opted to become trusts but GP fundholding was much less popular.Campbell, pp. 553\u2013554. There were allegations that fundholders received more funding than non-fundholders, creating a two-tier system. GP fundholding was abolished by Labour in 1997 and replaced by Primary Care Groups.Campbell, p. 554. According to John Campbell, by \"the mid-1990s the NHS was treating more patients, more efficiently than in the 1980s...the system was arguably better managed and more accountable than before\".

Gaitskell believed that Labour had to be seen to govern with fiscal responsibility, telling Dalton on 4 May 1951 that he and Bevan were engaged in a battle for the soul of the Labour Party, and that if Bevan won Labour would be out for many years (although, ironically, Gaitskell won but they were out of power for many years anyway).
