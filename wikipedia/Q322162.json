Later, it became clear that several different disease mechanisms were implicated, with the common link to a disordered activation of the immune system. In 1963, a new classification scheme was designed by Philip Gell and Robin Coombs that described four types of hypersensitivity reactions, known as Type I to Type IV hypersensitivity. With this new classification, the word allergy, sometimes clarified as a true allergy, was restricted to type I hypersensitivities (also called immediate hypersensitivity), which are characterized as rapidly developing reactions involving IgE antibodies."]}, {"page": "Coombs", "response": ["* Robin Coombs (1921\u20132006), British immunologist"]}, {"page": "Corpus Christi College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Robin Coombs"]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Robin Coombs, immunologist (died 2006)"]}, {"page": "List of eponymous medical signs", "response": ["|Coombs test   ||  Robin Coombs  || hematology || hemolytic anemia  || ||"]}, {"page": "Quick Professor of Biology", "response": ["* Robin Coombs (1966)"]}, {"page": "List of veterinarians", "response": ["*Robin Coombs (1921\u20132006) \u2014 British immunologist, co-discoverer of the Coombs test"]}, {"page": "Leckhampton, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Robin Coombs (1966-1969)"]}, {"page": "Coombs test", "response": ["The Coombs test was first described in 1945 by Cambridge immunologists Robin Coombs (after whom it is named), Arthur Mourant and Rob Race.

Previous research on blood group antibodies had documented the presence of so-called \"blocking\" or \"incomplete\" antibodies: antibodies that occupied antigen sites, preventing other antibodies from binding, but did not cause red blood cells to agglutinate. Coombs and his colleagues devised a method to easily demonstrate the presence of these antibodies. They injected human immunoglobulins into rabbits, which caused them to produce an anti-human globulin antibody. The anti-human globulin could bind to antibodies already attached to red blood cells and cause them to agglutinate. The invention of the antiglobulin test led to the discovery of many more blood group antigens. By the early 1950s, companies had begun producing commercial antisera for special antigen testing."]}]}}
