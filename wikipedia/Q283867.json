The first was probably a radio production of The Man of Property  in 11 weekly parts commencing 9 December 1945 on the BBC Home Service. The music used as the opening and closing theme came from Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations, specifically the Nimrod variation. This adaptation starred Leo Genn as Jo, Grizelda Hervey as Irene and Ronald Simpson as Soames.  It was adapted by Muriel Levy and produced by Val Gielgud and Felix Felton. Young Jolyons in later adaptations included Andrew Cruickshank, Leo Genn and Guy Rolfe. Another production of the dramatised cycle, which had Rachel Gurney as Irene, Noel Johnson as Young Jolyon and Alan Wheatley as Soames, came soon after the 1967 TV series. The version broadcast in 1990 comprised a 75-minute opening episode followed by 22 hour-long episodes, entitled The Forsyte Chronicles. It was the most expensive radio drama serial ever broadcast, due to its length and its big-name cast, which included Dirk Bogarde, Diana Quick, Michael Williams and Alan Howard. This radio series was rerun on BBC 7 radio in 2004, and has been released commercially."]}, {"page": "Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset", "response": ["* Guy Rolfe portrayed Edward Seymour in the 1953 film Young Bess."]}, {"page": "Nicholas and Alexandra", "response": ["*Guy Rolfe as Dr. Fedorov, the Imperial Court Surgeon"]}, {"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19 || Guy Rolfe || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 91 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "1987 in film", "response": ["* Dolls, directed by Stuart Gordon, starring Stephen Lee, Guy Rolfe, Hilary Mason, and Bunty Bailey"]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| The Bride || Columbia Pictures || Franc Roddam (director); Lloyd Fonvielle (screenplay); Sting, Jennifer Beals, Clancy Brown, Geraldine Page, David Rappaport, Anthony Higgins, Alexei Sayle, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Quentin Crisp, Cary Elwes, Phil Daniels, Timothy Spall, Ken Campbell, Guy Rolfe, Tony Haygarth, Janine Duvitski, John Sharp, Jack Birkett, Gerry Crampton || Horror || Live action"]}, {"page": "Young Bess", "response": ["When Henry dies, Thomas's scheming brother Ned (Guy Rolfe) takes over as Lord Protector and guardian of King Edward VI (Rex Thompson), overriding Henry's dying wish that Thomas raise the boy.
