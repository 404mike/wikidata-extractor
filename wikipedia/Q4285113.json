He played as an inside forward. Born in Aberdeen, Mutch started his football career with Avondale before joining Banks O' Dee. He then moved on to Arbroath, and signed for Manchester United in 1934. He played for United for four years, scoring 49 goals. After leaving, he went to Preston North End, where he helped the club win the 1938 FA Cup Final, the first to be shown on television. In the last minute of extra time, Mutch was fouled. He scored the resulting penalty kick, which rebounded from the underside of the bar, to win the match for Preston North End. Mutch remained with Preston throughout the Second World War, but joined Bury at the cessation of hostilities. After a season with Bury, he joined Southport as a player-trainer, before taking up his training responsibilities on a permanent basis in 1948. He then returned to Scotland as the manager of Banks O' Dee in 1950.\nHe earned one cap for the Scotland national football team, a 1\u20130 win over England at Wembley Stadium on 9 April 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill Shankly", "response": ["In 1936\u201337, Preston reached the FA Cup Final but were well beaten 3\u20131 by Sunderland at Wembley Stadium.Shankly, p. 41.

The team did so with a majority of their team being made up of Scottish players (the Scotch Professors). In a contribution to Paul Agnew's 1989 biography of Tom Finney, the player himself wrote: \"The club has long been known as Proud Preston, and the Old Invincibles of the previous century set some incredible standards\".Agnew, p. 55. The author wrote elsewhere: \"...and that team became immortalised as the 'Old Invincibles'\".Agnew, p. 53. Other sources call the team \"The Invincibles\" and both versions of the nickname have been used. In his autobiography, Finney wrote: \"The championship stayed with North End \u2014 by now tagged the Old Invincibles \u2014 the following year, but runners-up spot had to suffice for the next three seasons\". As Finney said, Preston were league champions again in 1889\u201390, but have not won the title since. In total, they have been league runners-up six times, including the three consecutive seasons from 1890 to 1891 to 1892\u201393, and twice in the 1950s when Finney was playing. The club's last major trophy win was in the 1938 FA Cup Final when they defeated Huddersfield Town 1\u20130 and the team included Bill Shankly, Andy Beattie and goalscorer George Mutch."]}, {"page": "List of Aberdonians", "response": ["*George Mutch (1912\u20132001), footballer and trainer"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 in English football", "response": ["* 30 March 2001: George Mutch, 88, Aberdeen born inside-forward, signed for Manchester United in 1934 and collected a Second Division title medal in 1936, managing 46 goals in 112 league games for the club before his transfer to Preston North End in 1937.
