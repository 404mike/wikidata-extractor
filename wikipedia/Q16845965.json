He was awarded the Sydney French Medal in 2004 by the British Origami Society and is an Honorary Member and President of the British Origami Society.\nHe has folded a kaleidoscope of projects over the course of his career, but is drawn to folding containers, masks, and simple designs. His approach to origami is to try and capture the essence of a subject using minimal creases, rather than a more realistic representation. He is actively involved with the Folding Didactic movement, which aims to promote academic study of the history of paper-folding and the most effective way to teach it.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nick Robinson", "response": ["Nicholas, Nicky or Nick Robinson may refer to:", "* Nick Robinson (journalist) (born 1963), British political journalist", "* Nick Robinson (paperfolder) (born 1957), British origami artist", "* Nick Robinson (English actor) (born 1986), British actor", "* Nick Robinson (American actor) (born 1995), American actor", "* Nick Robinson (basketball) (born 1979), college basketball head coach"]}, {"page": "The Comsat Angels", "response": ["Around 1990, they recruited Sheffield musician Nick Robinson as an additional guitarist.
