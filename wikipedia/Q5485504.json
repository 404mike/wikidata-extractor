He played for Aston Villa during his professional career and won seven caps as an England striker, scoring three times, including once against Germany on his debut in 1938.Having helped win promotion for Villa in the previous season, the 1937\u201338 pre-season Jubilee Fund matches saw Villa pitched against local rivals West Bromwich Albion. The derby match ended in a 1-1 draw with Broome scoring for Villa and Harry Jones grabbing one for the Baggies.Broome guested for Nottingham Forest during WW2, making 3 appearances (1 goal) in 1939\u201340, 1 appearance (4 goals) in 1940\u201341 and 10 appearances (4 goals) in 1941\u201342. He also guested for Wolves during wartime, playing and scoring in the 1942 War Cup Final.\nIn 1955 Broome signed for Shelbourne, making his League of Ireland debut on 27 February. The nearest he came to scoring was when he had a penalty saved at Glenmalure Park on 27 March in the FAI Cup.\nApproaching 40 years of age and coupled with the expense of weekly flights to Dublin he ended up only playing 6 games for Shels.\nAfter retiring from playing, he went on to manage both Exeter City, Southend United and in Australia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Exeter City F.C.", "response": ["| Frank Broome", "| Frank Broome"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Frank Broome (Caretaker)"]}, {"page": "Southend United F.C.", "response": ["|1960-1960||Frank Broome"]}, {"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["In March 1952, Lawton joined Second Division side Brentford for a club record \u00a316,000 fee. Manager Jackie Gibbons left the club at the start of the 1952\u201353 season and was succeeded by his assistant Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953\u201354 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing Dear Old Pals.", "He was appointed as Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club away from being relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious making new signings due to financial constraints on the part of the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to go without his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were however relegated at the end of the 1957\u201358 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall back on, and nothing in writing."]}]}}
