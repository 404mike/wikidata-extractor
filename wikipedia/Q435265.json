Three of the characters were based on former librarians at the Bodleian at one time or another, although the library itself is never identified by name in the novel. Principal among them was Robert Liddell, nicknamed \"Jock\" as in the diary entry, who is Dr Nicholas Parnell, the former university friend who comes to stay with the Archdeacon. The other two librarians were Count Roberto Weiss and John Barnicot, who become the novel's Count Ricardo Bianco and his dead friend John Akenside. Two more women also had real-life counterparts. Edith Liversidge was based on Honor Tracy, once Liddell's love interest, while Lady Clara Boulding has been identified with Lady Julia Pakenham, a daughter of the 5th Earl of Longford.

Her shrewd but affectionate portrayals of middle-class and upper middle-class English life won her an audience of discriminating readers, as well as loyal friends in the world of letters.

Her long correspondence with the latter forms the subject of one of her short stories, \"The Letter Writers\" (published in The Blush, 1951), but the letters were destroyed, in line with her general policy of keeping her private life private.

Elizabeth Langland in her 1989 monograph Anne Bront\u00eb: The Other One said: \"It is worth pausing briefly to reflect on what might have been Anne\u2019s fate had The Tenant of Wildfell Hall been re-published with Agnes Grey so that critics could re-acquaint themselves with Anne\u2019s greater novel and so that critics could take that opportunity to measure the substantial artistic growth between the two novels.\" Langland argued that the heroines in Anne's novels influenced those of Charlotte, and named Anne among the first women writers to adopt a woman as narrator. Langland concluded that \"if Charlotte Bront\u00eb was radical in claiming sexual identity for women, then Anne Bront\u00eb was radical in claiming professional identity for women.\" Robert Liddell, noting Anne's apparent distaste for Romantic tradition, claimed that The Tenant criticized both Branwell's life and Wuthering Heights. Edward Chitham in A Life of Anne Bront\u00eb (1991) also juxtaposed the novels of Anne and her sisters'. He stated that in Anne's view Wuthering Heights exhibited elements which she called in the preface to the second edition of The Tenant a \"soft nonsense,\" thus making \"almost an accusation against Emily.\" Unlike Chitham and Liddell, Maria H. Frawley identified the central element in The Tenant as the criticism of 19th century domestic ideology that encouraged women to \"construct themselves as ethereal angels of morality and virtue\". Betty Jay, analyzing Helen's marital experience, concluded that The Tenant \"not only demonstrates that the individual is subject to powerful ideological forces which delineate his or her place within culture and society, but that there are ways in which these forces can be subverted and resisted by those who suffer as a result. In a narrative which dramatizes the complex interplay between subject and society by focusing on the marital experience of a woman, Bronte highlights the extent to which the internal and supposedly private realms of desire and domesticity are also intensely political.\""]}, {"page": "Ivy Compton-Burnett", "response": ["Given the subjects of most of her works, it was widely assumed that the Compton-Burnett family were landed gentry; in his review of the final volume of Hilary Spurling's biography, J.
