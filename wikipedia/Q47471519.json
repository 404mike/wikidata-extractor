Tatler featured writers from Brown's eclectic circle including Julian Barnes, Dennis Potter, Auberon Waugh, Brian Sewell, Georgina Howell (whom Brown appointed deputy editor),  and Nicholas Coleridge (later President of Conde Nast International). Brown herself wrote content for every issue, contributing irreverent surveys of the upper classes. She travelled through Scotland to portray the owners' stately homes. She also wrote short satirical profiles of eligible London bachelors under the pen-name Rosie Boot."]}, {"page": "List of books featured on Book of the Week in 2015", "response": ["* Queen of the Desert \u2013 Georgina Howell"]}]}}
