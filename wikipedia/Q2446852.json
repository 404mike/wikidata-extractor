As a result, he may be considered a late example of the gentleman detective, a staple of British detective fiction. This is in sharp contrast to the working-class lifestyle of his assistant Lewis (named after another rival clue-writer, Mrs.\u00a0B. Lewis); in the novels, Lewis is Welsh, but in the TV series this is altered to a Tyneside (Geordie) background, appropriately for the actor Kevin Whately. Morse is in his forties at the start of the books (Service of all the Dead, Chapter Six: \"\u2026 a bachelor still, forty-seven years old \u2026\"), and Lewis slightly younger (e.g. The Secret of Annexe 3, Chapter Twenty-Six: \"a slightly younger man \u2013 another policeman, and one also in plain clothes\").
