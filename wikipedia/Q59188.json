Giles was the fourth son of John Allen Giles (1808\u20131884), an Anglican clergyman. After studying at Charterhouse, Herbert became a British diplomat to Qing China, serving from 1867 to 1892.  He also spent several years (1885\u20131888) at Fort Santo Domingo in Tamsui, northern Taiwan. Giles\u2019 great grandson, Giles Pickford, stated in an address at the opening of the Fort San Domingo Museum \u2013 8 November 2005, that his great grandfather, Herbert A Giles, was Her Britannic Majesty's Consul in Tamsui, Fort San Domingo from 1885 until 1891. Prior to that time, in 1869, Giles was based at Kaoshiung.Presentation Notes held at the Australian National University;https://anulib.anu.edu.au/files/guidance/address-by-giles-pickford-text.pdf He was the father of Bertram, Valentine, Lancelot, Edith, Mable, and Lionel Giles. In 1897 Herbert Giles became only the second professor of Chinese language appointed at the University of Cambridge, succeeding Thomas Wade. At the time of his appointment, there were no other sinologists at Cambridge. Giles was therefore free to spend most of his time among the ancient Chinese texts earlier donated by Wade, publishing what he chose to translate from his eclectic reading in Chinese literature.Aylmer, Charles, East Asian History 13\u201314, 1997, pp. 1\u20137; Sterckx, Roel, In the Fields of Shennong: An inaugural lecture delivered before the University of Cambridge on 30 September 2008 to mark the establishment of the Joseph Needham Professorship of Chinese History, Science and Civilization. Cambridge: Needham Research Institute, 2008. Giles published over sixty books, lectures, pamphlets, journal articles, book reviews, and newspaper articles. During his long life he completed a comprehensive Chinese-English Dictionary which took over fifteen years to compile and became a standard reference for many years. Giles also published the first history of Chinese literature and art, which also became a reference work. Some of his translations have stood the test of time and are still among the best available. Giles was not afraid to be controversial and outspoken on numerous topics. To quote his great grandson, \"Most of his enemies were people whose work he had criticized.  Such people included E H Parker, a sinologist at Manchester University; Sir Walter Hillier a sinologist from London; and Sir Thomas Wade, Minister to China (1870-76 and 1880-82) and therefore Giles\u2019s superior in the Consular Service. Wade was later Professor of Chinese at the University of Cambridge (1888-95).  Giles was to succeed him in this position in 1897.\" Giles was also outspoken on the work of Christian Missionaries and British traders because of the overcrowding of Chinese emigrants on British ships. Yet as Charles Aylmer wrote, in his Memoirs of H. A. Giles, \"Notwithstanding his reputation for abrasiveness, he would speak to anyone in the street from the Vice-Chancellor to a crossing-sweeper and was remembered by acquaintances as a man of great personal charm. \"Presentation Notes held at the Australian National University;https://anulib.anu.edu.au/files/guidance/address-by-giles-pickford-text.pdfAylmer, Charles, East Asian History 13\u201314, 1997, pp. 1\u20137; Sterckx, Roel, In the Fields of Shennong: An inaugural lecture delivered before the University of Cambridge on 30 September 2008 to mark the establishment of the Joseph Needham Professorship of Chinese History, Science and Civilization.

This could be due to the burning of books and burying of scholars which occurred during the reign of Qin Shi Huang. However, some scholars believe that the Zhuangzi invented him as a Daoist exemplar.  Frederic H. Balfour, who translated several Daoist texts, called Liezi \"a philosopher who never lived\" (1887:?) Lionel Giles expresses doubt in his Introduction: Very little is known of our author beyond what he tells us himself. His full name was Lieh Y\u00fc-k'ou, and it appears that he was living in the Ch\u00eang State not long before the year 398 BC, when the Prime Minister Tzu Yang was killed in a revolution. He figures prominently in the pages of Chuang Tzu, from whom we learn that he could 'ride upon the wind'. On the insufficient ground that he is not mentioned by the historian Ssu-ma Ch'ien, a certain critic of the Sung dynasty was led to declare that Lieh Tzu was only a fictitious personage invented by Chuang Tzu, and that the treatise which passes under his name was a forgery of later times. This theory is rejected by the compilers of the great Catalogue of Ch'ien Lung's Library, who represent the cream of Chinese scholarship in the eighteenth century.", "In the above quote Mr. Lionel Giles may have been refuting his father Herbert Allen Giles, who wrote of Lie Yukou or Lieh-Tzu in his translation of Chuang Tzu.

However, it is believed that the text of the manual was composed during the late 6th century under the Northern Zhou dynasty (557\u2013581).  The main evidence for this is the fact that the author of the text refers to the black pieces as \"crow pieces\" (\u70cf\u5b50) rather than \"black pieces\" (\u9ed1\u5b50).  The explanation for this unusual term is that Yuwen Tai (507\u2013556), father of the first emperor of the Northern Zhou, and posthumously honoured as the founding emperor of the dynasty, had the nickname 'Black Otter' (\u9ed1\u737a), and therefore the character 'black' () was tabooed in documents written during the Northern Zhou dynasty, being replaced by the word 'crow' () which is a synonym for 'black' in Chinese."]}, {"page": "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains", "response": ["* Liezi book 5, translated by Lionel Giles, on wikisource"]}, {"page": "1951 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Lionel Giles, .
