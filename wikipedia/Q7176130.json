In this capacity, he was required to give a series of lectures on any area of interest to him. When exploring texts for inspiration, he chanced upon \"quasi-contracts\", a concept traceable to Roman law, but which was at that point unrecognised in English law. Together with Ronald Maudsley, then the law tutor at Brasenose College, he set up a series of seminars in Restitution, also described as \"Unjustifiable Enrichment\" and \"Quasi Contract\". The lectures were not on the syllabus and not many students attended. They did attract academic attendees, some of whom, such as Peter North, went on to be distinguished academic lawyers.thumb|Goff & Jones on the Law of Unjust Enrichment, now in its ninth edition|alt=|436x436pxOn the basis of these lectures, Goff and Maudsley jointly began work on the book that would later become Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution (today published as Goff and Jones on the Law of Unjust Enrichment). Goff had continued drafting the textbook after leaving academia for the Commercial Bar. At the time, work for junior barristers was limited, and so he spent considerable time working on the book at the Inner Temple library. During this period, Maudsley spent long stretches of time in the United States, and did not respond to Goff's communications. In 1959, Goff was reading a Law Quarterly Review and came across an article written by Maudsley, which he believed to be based heavily on the material they had prepared in their joint lectures. Goff wrote to Maudsley once again, but upon not receiving a reply, concluded that Maudsley \"was signing off and didn't feel able to tell me\". As a junior barrister with a growing practice, Goff realised that if his book was to be completed, he would need a collaborator. A. W. B. Simpson introduced him to Gareth Jones, then fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later Downing Professor of the Laws of England, with whom he would eventually publish the book. Goff would later describe Jones as \"the ideal co-author\" and \"beyond doubt, one of the finest teachers in the common law world\"."]}, {"page": "The North Report", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter North (legal scholar)"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of Jesus College, Oxford", "response": ["The first three Honorary Fellows, all former students of the college, were elected in October 1877: John Rhys, the first Jesus Professor of Celtic who was later an Official Fellow (1881\u201395) and Principal (1895\u20131915); the historian John Richard Green; and the poet Lewis Morris.Baker, VCH Three other former Principals (John Christie, Sir John Habakkuk and Sir Peter North) have been elected Honorary Fellows on retirement.
