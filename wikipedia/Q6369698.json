Actress Karen Henthorn was cast in the role. Henthorn had previously auditioned to play the minor role of a pregnancy counsellor for the character Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). She was not offered the part, but she was instead asked to audition for the much bigger role of Julie. Having been called back to Elstree Studios to discuss the role with the casting director, Henthorn was told that EastEnders were creating a new \"semi-regular\" character, Julie Haye, specifically as a love interest for Nigel Bates. Actor Paul Bradley, who played Nigel, had decided to leave the serial the following year, reportedly for fear of being typecast.

The audition proved successful and they re-called Henthorn to read through some new scenes, which she had to learn for a screen test. Henthorn has commented, \"this meeting was with the same director and two casting directors and took place on the Friday morning. I was offered the job that lunchtime!\"", "Actress Karen Henthorn has since reflected on her time in EastEnders: \"I tried to keep an open mind regarding any expectations of the job.
