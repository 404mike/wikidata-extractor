He made his debut in a 5\u20131 victory at Blackburn Rovers but he was at fault for Rovers' goal and was 'not at ease'.  That nervy display convinced the management that he needed a spell in the reserves, and was replaced by Gilbert Brookes and played just one more match in 1922\u201323. Early in the 1923\u201324 season Dixon won his place back this time from Scottish international Ken Campbell. New manager Tom Mather installed Dixon as his first choice and he went on to conceded just three goals in three months and banish memories of his awkward debut.  Rarely seen without his cloth cap, Dixon's courage during the relegation battle of 1924\u201325 dug his errant defenders out of the mire on numerous occasions and was not afraid to throw himself at oncoming forwards feet often leading to personal injury. Following errors in a 3\u20130 home defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers in March 1925, Dixon was dropped."]}]}}
