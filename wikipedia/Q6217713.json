Sanders and Peter M. Lefferts, \"Motet, \u00a7I: Middle Ages\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). The motet probably arose from clausula sections in a longer sequence of organum. Clausulae represent brief sections of longer polyphonic settings of chant with a note-against-note texture. In some cases, these sections were composed independently and \"substituted\" for existing setting. These clausulae could then be \"troped,\" or given new text in the upper part(s), creating motets. From these first motets arose a medieval tradition of secular motets.  These were two- to four-part compositions in which different texts, sometimes in different vernacular languages, were sung simultaneously over a (usually Latin-texted) cantus firmus usually adapted from a passage of Gregorian chant. Later the cantus firmus was instead played on an instrument, marked in the score with a word \"mot\" to indicate its origin. It is also increasingly argued that the term \"motet\" could in fact include certain brief single-voice songs. The texts of upper voices include subjects as diverse as courtly love odes, pastoral encounters with shepherdesses, political attacks, and many Christian devotions, especially to the Virgin Mary. Most medieval motets are anonymous compositions and significantly re-use music and text. They are transmitted in a number of contexts, and were most popular in northern France. The largest surviving collection is in the Montpellier Codex.", "The compositional character of the motet changed entirely during the transition from medieval to Renaissance music, as most composers abandoned the use of a repeated figure as a cantus firmus. Guillaume Dufay was a transitional figure in this regard, writing one of the last important motets in the medieval, isorhythmic style, Nuper rosarum flores, in 1436.Alec Robertson and Denis Stevens, eds., A History of Music, Volume 2 (New York: Barnes and Noble, Inc., 1965), 85.Edgar H. Sparks, Cantus Firmus in Mass and Motet 1420\u20131520 (New York: Da Capo Press, 1975), 86. During the second half of the fifteenth century Motets stretched the cantus firmus to greater lengths compared to the surrounding multi-voice counterpoint, adopting a technique of contemporary 'tenor masses'.Leeman L. Perkins and Patrick Macey, \"Motet, \u00a7II: Renaissance\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). This obscured the cantus firmus' rhythm more than in medieval isorhythmic motets. Cascading, passing chords created by the interplay of voices and the absence of an obvious beat distinguish medieval and renaissance motet styles."]}, {"page": "Opera", "response": ["Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko's opera Straszny Dw\u00f3r (in English The Haunted Manor) (1861\u201364) represents a nineteenth-century peak of Polish national opera.See the chapter on \"Russian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian Opera to 1900\" by John Tyrrell in The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera (1994).

Peri's Euridice opens with a brief instrumental ritornello, and Monteverdi's L'Orfeo (1607) opens with a toccata, in this case a fanfare for muted trumpets.

The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Handel also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as Giulio Cesare.", "In Italy, a distinct form called \"overture\" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of Alessandro Scarlatti, and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century.Fisher, Stephen C. 2001. \"Italian Overture.\" The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell. London: Macmillan Publishers. It uses three generally homophonic movements: fast\u2013slow\u2013fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the gigue or minuet, and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called \"sonatina form\" (sonata form without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical."]}, {"page": "Steve Reich", "response": ["Reich was born in New York City to the Broadway lyricist June Sillman and Leonard Reich.

At the age of 14 he began to study music in earnest, after hearing music from the Baroque period and earlier, as well as music of the 20th century.
