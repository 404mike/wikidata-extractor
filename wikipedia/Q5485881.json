Money's personal contribution to this game was not great, but it was a sensational game, known widely as \"Cobden's Match\" on account of the feat of the Cambridge bowler Frank Cobden, who, with Oxford requiring three runs to win, took the last three wickets in three balls, a hat-trick, to win the match for Cambridge. Money had had his own personal triumph in the University Match of the previous year, 1869, when his bowling figures of six for 24 and five for 35 were instrumental in another Cambridge victory. Those were the best bowling figures of his first-class career, but though his bowling fell away in 1870 his batting developed and he scored the only two centuries of his career in that season. The higher was an innings of 134 against Surrey, for whom he had played in a couple of games in the 1869 season. A more prominent innings was his unbeaten 109, following a first-innings top score of 70, for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval; W. G. Grace, just nine days older than Money, made 215 in the same second innings. Where Grace went on in first-class cricket for a further 38 years, however, Money played only four further matches, three of them for Cambridge University in 1871; the University Match that year was his last first-class game and he was twice a victim of Samuel Butler, who took all 10 wickets in Cambridge's first innings and 15 in the match."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Frank Cobden (1870\u20131872) : F.

As a cricketer, he was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a left-arm bowler: sources disagree about whether he was a fast bowler or a medium-paced one, but agree that he bowled in the round-arm style. He played in three matches for Cambridge University in 1868 as \"E. E. Harrison\" without making much impact, and was then not picked for any first-team games at all in 1869. He returned to the university team in 1870 and took seven wickets in his first game, against the MCC. That led to his selection for the 1870 University Match against Oxford University, a game that has been widely known as \"Cobden's Match\" through the feat of the Cambridge bowler Frank Cobden, who took the last three Oxford wickets in three balls \u2013 a hat-trick \u2013 to win the game for Cambridge by just two runs. Ward was just as influential in the Cambridge victory, his six wickets for 29 in the Oxford second innings, in 32 four-ball overs, being the best bowling performance of his first-class cricket career. He returned to the Cambridge side in 1871, but was less effective, and the University Match of that year, in which he failed to take any wickets, was his last first-class match.
