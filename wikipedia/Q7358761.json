He played for Manchester City and Oldham Athletic. He is the all-time leading goal-scorer at Oldham.\nRoger was an undemonstrative player, and a quiet and modest man off the field.\nRoger's career culminated in a superb run of success for Oldham, including appearances in the 1990 Football League Cup Final at Wembley and FA Cup semi-finals. In his testimonial season (1990\u201391), Oldham won the Second Division championship and rejoined the top flight of English football.\nSince his retirement from football, he has been reclusive but he is remembered with fondness in Oldham.\nThe Latics fans demonstrate their reverence for Roger in their chant \"Ooooh, Roger Palmer, oooooh, Roger Palmer,\".\nIn January 2008, the BBC Sport website put out an appeal for information on Palmer's whereabouts, ahead of the Oldham v Everton FA Cup Third Round tie. The teams last played in a cup tie in 1990, with Palmer the only player whose whereabouts were unknown. Both the media and Oldham Athletic attempted several times to contact Palmer without success. 'Where is Roger Palmer?' went round Boundary Park several times.\nFinally, on 8 May 2010 on the final day of the season against Charlton Athletic, Palmer made an appearance on the Boundary Park pitch at half time to rapturous applause and chants of \"OOOHH ROGER PALMER!\".\nRoger has been living on the Racecourse Estate in Sale, Greater Manchester, since retirement. He played the odd game for local community centre and a couple of Sunday games for local pubs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oldham Athletic A.F.C.", "response": ["*Most League goals: 141 Roger Palmer, 1980\u20131994", "*Most overall goals: 156 Roger Palmer, 1980\u20131994"]}, {"page": "Roger Palmer", "response": ["Roger Palmer may refer to:", "* Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine (1634\u20131705), English courtier, diplomat and MP, 1660", "* Roger Palmer (MP), English MP at various times between 1624 and 1644", "* Roger Palmer (footballer) (born 1959)", "* Sir Roger Palmer, 5th Baronet, Member of the UK Parliament for Mayo, 1857\u20131865"]}, {"page": "Palmer (surname)", "response": ["*Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine (1634\u20131705), Irish earl, husband of Barbara Villiers Palmer", "*Roger Palmer (footballer) (born 1959), English ex-footballer"]}, {"page": "1990 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||12 || Roger Palmer || || "]}, {"page": "History of Oldham Athletic A.F.C.", "response": ["At the same time, Oldham had started another excellent cup run, this time in the FA Cup.

In the replay, Rick Holden scored an excellent solo goal to give the Latics a 1\u20130 win and set up a fourth round tie at home to Second Division Brighton & Hove Albion. Brighton took a first half lead before two goals in a minute from Scott McGarvey and Ritchie gave Oldham a hard-fought 2\u20131 win. First Division Everton were the visitors to Boundary Park for the fifth round tie, and raced into a 2\u20130 half time lead thanks to goals from Tony Cottee and future Oldham player/manager Graeme Sharp. A second half fightback saw the underdogs claim a draw thanks to an Ritchie penalty and a late Roger Palmer header. The replay at Goodison Park was again a draw \u2013 ex-Evertonian Ian Marshall's close range header for Oldham being cancelled out by a disputed Kevin Sheedy penalty. Another replay was required, and this time Oldham prevailed \u2013 a goal from Palmer and a penalty from Marshall cancelling out Cottee's early strike to give Oldham a 2\u20131 win and hand them another home tie, this time against First Division leaders Aston Villa. The Villains were beaten 3\u20130 thanks to Holden's  effort, Neil Redfearn's close range finish and a Chris Price own goal.
