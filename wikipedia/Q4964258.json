They were a second-hand pair of Winit boots bought from the former Doncaster Rovers centre forward, Ray Harrison's sports shop. Keegan played football at Hyde Park using his baby brother Michael's pushchair as a goal post. As a boy he supported Doncaster Rovers. His favourite player was Alick Jeffrey, a player, once described by Matt Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy as the English Pel\u00e9, and once described by Jackie Milburn as \"the best young player he had ever seen\". As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for Coventry City, under manager Jimmy Hill. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back Brian Joy who also went on to have a 15-year career in football. Keegan also had a trial with Doncaster Rovers, arranged by his father, but when Keegan arrived, he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place."]}, {"page": "Ian Joy", "response": ["Born in San Diego, California, Joy is the son of English former professional player Brian Joy.
