After the 1938 Anschluss with Hitler's Germany, he was put on the first Kindertransport train to leave Vienna. He was initially housed in a refugee camp at Lowestoft in England. After this he lived with a Jewish family, who were West End tailors in London. Grunberger entered their tailoring business. His desire for education however led to his taking A levels at Birkbeck college. He gained an exhibition scholarship in history at King's College London.When he went to the Wiener Library in London, he expressed to a friend his frustration at the absence of a book that held together the masses of documentation surrounding Nazism and 20th-century Germany. A friend asked why he did not write one, and so he did. The product was A Social History of the Third Reich, first published in 1971 by Weidenfeld & Nicolson. It has since become a significant text for studying the social history of Nazi Germany in schools and at undergraduate level.Initially, much of Grunberger's leisure time in Britain was taken up by the communist youth group Young Austria. In spite of this, his political outlook was social democratic.Books\nA Social History of the Third Reich\nGermany 1918\u20131945\nHitler's S.S.\nRed Rising in Bavaria", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernst Kaltenbrunner", "response": ["Fear of a collapsing home-front due to the Allied bombing campaigns and that another \"stab-in-the-back\" at home could arise, as a result, caused Kaltenbrunner to immediately tighten the Nazi grip within Germany.

In the movie Friesennot, depicting ethnic Germans persecuted in the Soviet Union, a half-Friesan woman is murdered for her association with a Russian man, as her German blood outweighs her Russian blood. Her murder is presented as in accordance with ancient Germanic custom for \"race pollution\".Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p 384,  Similarly, when the Sudeten German heroine of Die goldene Stadt allows herself to be seduced and impregnated by a Czech, she drowns herself. Even fairy tales were put to use for this purpose, with Cinderella being presented as a tale of how the prince's racial instincts lead him to reject the stepmother's alien blood for the racially pure maiden. This propaganda showed its effects in the marriage advertisements, which decreased money considerations for eugenic ones, with the advertisers representing themselves as and asking for \"Nordic\" or \"Aryan\".Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p 237-8, ", "The film Kolberg depicted title town in stubborn resistance to the French forces of the Napoleonic wars in order to stir resistance in the German people.Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p 388,  Goebbels explicitly ordered the use of the historical events for a film, which he regarded as highly suitable for the circumstances Germany faced.

In the Volksgemeinschaft, social classes would continue to exist, but there would be no class conflict between them.

Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2000, p. 245. German business leaders co-operated with the Nazis during their rise to power and received substantial benefits from the Nazi state after it was established, including high profits and state-sanctioned monopolies and cartels.Grunberger, Richard, A Social History of the Third Reich, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1971. pp. 167, 175\u201376 Large celebrations and symbolism were used extensively to encourage those engaged in physical labour on behalf of Germany, with leading National Socialists often praising the \"honour of labour\", which fostered a sense of community (Gemeinschaft) for the German people and promoted solidarity towards the Nazi cause.Alf L\u00fcdtke, \"The 'Honor of Labor': Industrial Workers and the Power of Symbols under National Socialism\", in Nazism and German Society, 1933\u20131945, edited by David F. Crew (New York: Routledge, 1994), pp. 67\u2013109. To win workers away from Marxism, Nazi propaganda sometimes presented its expansionist foreign policy goals as a \"class struggle between nations.\" Bonfires were made of school children's differently coloured caps as symbolic of the unity of different social classes.Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p. 46, ", "The Nazis came to power in the midst of Great Depression, when the unemployment rate at that point in time was close to 30%. Generally speaking, Nazi theorists and politicians blamed Germany's previous economic failures on political causes like the influence of Marxism on the workforce, the sinister and exploitative machinations of what they called international Jewry and the vindictiveness of the western political leaders' war reparation demands. Instead of traditional economic incentives, the Nazis offered solutions of a political nature, such as the elimination of organised trade unions, rearmament (in contravention of the Versailles Treaty) and biological politics.R.J. Overy, War and Economy in the Third Reich (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pp. 1\u20135. Various work programs designed to establish full-employment for the German population were instituted once the Nazis seized full national power. Hitler encouraged nationally supported projects like the construction of the Autobahn highway system, the introduction of an affordable people's car (Volkswagen) and later the Nazis bolstered the economy through the business and employment generated by military rearmament.R. J. Overy, War and Economy in the Third Reich (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pp. 7\u201311. The Nazis benefited early in the regime's existence from the first post-Depression economic upswing, and this combined with their public works projects, job-procurement program and subsidised home repair program reduced unemployment by as much as 40 per cent in one year. This development tempered the unfavourable psychological climate caused by the earlier economic crisis and encouraged Germans to march in step with the regime.Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich: A Social History of Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945 (New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1971), p. 19. The economic policies of the Nazis were in many respects a continuation of the policies of the German National People's Party, a national-conservative party and the Nazis' coalition partner.Beck Hermann, The Fateful Alliance: German Conservatives and Nazis in 1933: The Machtergreifung in a New Light (New York: Berghahn Books, 2008), p. 243. While other Western capitalist countries strove for increased state ownership of industry during the same period, the Nazis transferred public ownership and public services into the private sector. It was an intentional policy with multiple objectives rather than ideologically driven and was used as a", "The Nazis were hostile to the idea of social welfare in principle, upholding instead the social Darwinist concept that the weak and feeble should perish. They condemned the welfare system of the Weimar Republic as well as private charity, accusing them of supporting people regarded as racially inferior and weak, who should have been weeded out in the process of natural selection. Nevertheless, faced with the mass unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression, the Nazis found it necessary to set up charitable institutions to help racially-pure Germans in order to maintain popular support, while arguing that this represented \"racial self-help\" and not indiscriminate charity or universal social welfare. Nazi programs such as the Winter Relief of the German People and the broader National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) were organised as quasi-private institutions, officially relying on private donations from Germans to help others of their race, although in practice those who refused to donate could face severe consequences. Unlike the social welfare institutions of the Weimar Republic and the Christian charities, the NSV distributed assistance on explicitly racial grounds. It provided support only to those who were \"racially sound, capable of and willing to work, politically reliable, and willing and able to reproduce.\" Non-Aryans were excluded, as well as the \"work-shy\", \"asocials\" and the \"hereditarily ill.\" Successful efforts were made to get middle-class women involved in social work assisting large families, and the Winter Relief campaigns acted as a ritual to generate public sympathy.Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p. 79, "]}, {"page": "Mary Fitzpayne", "response": ["Fitzpayne was born Alice Mary Payne in Catterick, North Yorkshire, and brought up in Leeds.
