In 2018, the Sentencing Council began deliberating on whether to increase the maximum sentence for suspects with many social media followers. Digital secretary Margot James also outlined a plan to increase government regulation of social networks with possible penalties including 4% of the firm's global turnover.

He was criticised  for saying that a refusal by ten technology companies to send representatives to a meeting he held gave him \"a big impetus to drive these proposals to legislate through.\" As of 2017, it was estimated that nine people per day were being arrested for online speech in the UK with five leading to convictions."]}, {"page": "Feminism in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament.
