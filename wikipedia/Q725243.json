Guthrie writes, \"[Socrates] was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything, and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance, while they were not.

According to tradition, Sophroniscus was by trade a stonemason or sculptor.p. 58, W. K. C. Guthrie, Socrates, Cambridge University Press, 1971.  Plato scholars Thomas Brickhouse and Nicholas D. Smith question the authenticity of that tradition, mainly on the grounds that the earliest extant sources of the story are comparatively late and that it is unmentioned by more reliable sources such as Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes, or Aristotle.p. 17, The Philosophy of Socrates, Westview Press, 2000.  According to John Burnet, the earliest extant mention of Socrates as a statuary or stonemason is in Timon of Philius,Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v., \"Socrates\", 1919. as quoted by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius 2.19.  Burnet claims that Timon \"is a very unsafe authority for anything\", and that the attribution \"appears to have arisen from an almost certainly false interpretation of [Socrates'] references to Daedalus as the ancestor of his family\" (in Plato's Euthyphro 11c, 15b). Burnet points out that Daedalus had nothing to do with stone-cutting or marble sculpture; his media were instead metal and wood.  Burnet furthermore argues that Xenophon and Plato would at some point have explicitly mentioned Socrates' background in stone-craftsmanship, if it were real, since both writers so often make Socrates mention craftsmen.p. 50, Plato's Euthyphro, Apology of Socrates, and Crito, Oxford University Press, 1924. Burnet cites Plato's Apology 22c9ff. and Xenophon's Memorabilia 3.10.6 as passages where the writers could not have avoided mentioning Socrates' own experience with craftsmanship if he really had any.  Another early source of the claim that Socrates was a stone-worker is Duris of Samos, who described Socrates as a slave.Cited in Diogenes La\u00ebrtius 2.19.
