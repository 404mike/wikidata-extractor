He went on to become the London Regional Education Officer for the TUC. Having joined the Labour Party in his youth, in the 1940s he was also a member of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist Party.  He was a councillor on Southall Borough Council 1951\u201355.\nBidwell contested East Hertfordshire in 1959 and South West Hertfordshire in 1964. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Southall at the 1966 general election, and was elected for the largely similar seat of Ealing Southall in 1983.\nWhilst in Parliament, he saw through a bill to exclude Sikhs from being forced to wear crash helmets on motorbikes.\nBefore the 1992 general election, Bidwell was de-selected as a candidate at the age of 75.  When his appeal to the Labour National Executive Committee failed, he decided to stand as a \"True Labour\" candidate, but finished third behind the official Labour candidate Piara Khabra, with 9% of the vote.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["Sitting MPs Dave Nellist, Terry Fields, Ron Brown, John Hughes and Syd Bidwell, who had been expelled or deselected by the Labour Party and stood as independents, were all defeated, although in Nellist's case only very narrowly.

He found no evidence that Gately had been killed by the police, as had been alleged by some elements of the hard-left press, and concluded that \"those who started the riot carry a measure of moral responsibility for his death; and the responsibility is a heavy one\". He found fault with some actions of the police on the day. The events in the square made the National Front a household name in the UK, although it is debatable if this had any impact on their share of the vote in subsequent general elections. Although the IMG was heavily criticised by the press and public, there was a rise in localised support, and the willingness to demonstrate against the National Front and its policies. There was further violence associated with National Front marches and the counter-demonstrations they faced, including in Birmingham, Manchester, the East End of London (all 1977) and in 1979 in Southall, which led to the death of Blair Peach. After Peach's death, the Labour Party Member of Parliament Syd Bidwell, who had been about to give a speech in Red Lion Square when the violence started, described Peach and Gately as martyrs against fascism and racism.", "Liberation also planned a demonstration for 15 June, leaving the Embankment and marching to Red Lion Square to enter Conway Hall. After discussions with the police, it was decided that entry to the hall for the Liberation meeting was to be by the back door on Theobalds Road. The police also agreed the organisation could hold a small open-air meeting in Red Lion Square, which they needed to access from Old North Road, which linked the square and Theobalds Road. Syd Bidwell, a Labour Party Member of Parliament was scheduled to address the meeting. Liberation had not been involved in political violence, and police did not fear any violence. What Liberation did not know, was that the IMG were determined to picket the front entrance of Conway Hall to deny the National Front access."]}, {"page": "Sydney James Bidwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Bidwell"]}, {"page": "Southall (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Syd Bidwell"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["| 75 || Syd Bidwell"]}, {"page": "Sid Bidwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Bidwell"]}, {"page": "Bidwell (surname)", "response": ["* Syd Bidwell (1917\u20131997), former British Labour MP"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 1997", "response": ["*Syd Bidwell, 80, British politician."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Syd Bidwell"]}]}}
