He went on to become the London Regional Education Officer for the TUC. Having joined the Labour Party in his youth, in the 1940s he was also a member of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist Party.  He was a councillor on Southall Borough Council 1951\u201355.\nBidwell contested East Hertfordshire in 1959 and South West Hertfordshire in 1964. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Southall at the 1966 general election, and was elected for the largely similar seat of Ealing Southall in 1983.\nWhilst in Parliament, he saw through a bill to exclude Sikhs from being forced to wear crash helmets on motorbikes.\nBefore the 1992 general election, Bidwell was de-selected as a candidate at the age of 75.  When his appeal to the Labour National Executive Committee failed, he decided to stand as a \"True Labour\" candidate, but finished third behind the official Labour candidate Piara Khabra, with 9% of the vote.", "link_mentions": {}}}
