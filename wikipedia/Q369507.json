The following month, Whitehead and teammate Liam Lawrence both signed new contracts. He continued to establish himself in the first-team, under the management of newly appointed manager Roy Keane. Whitehead then scored his first goal of the season against West Bromwich Albion, in a 2\u20130 win during which he was named as man of the match. Then, on 21 October, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win against Barnsley. During the 2006\u201307 season, Whitehead resigned the captaincy to concentrate on his football but he deputised for the frequently injured Steven Caldwell and was reappointed as captain on a permanent basis after Caldwell was sold to Burnley. At one point during the 2006\u201307 season, Whitehead played in a right\u2013back position following the absence of Nyron Nosworthy. The following month, he reverted to his central midfield position. Towards the end of the season, Whitehead scored two more goals. Sunderland finished first in the Championship in 2006\u201307, thus making an instant return to the Premier League. At the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Whitehead was included in the PFA Team of the Year. He also came second in the club's Player of the Year vote.

Following promotion to the Premier League for the 2005\u201306 season, Sunderland signed several additional players and Collins found himself out of the first team squad early in the season.

Scotland manager Craig Brown stated that 'Charlie Miller has always been a talented player and now I think his club manager Alex Smith has got the best out of him and this is a new challenge for him'. Brown resigned as Scotland boss later in 2001 after failing to qualify for the 2002 World Cup and Miller was overlooked by Brown's successor Berti Vogts.

The fee was undisclosed. He made his debut for the club in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Braga in the group stage of the Europa League. Away to Club Brugge in the same competition, he was knocked unconscious in a clash of heads with Joseph Akpala for which he received lengthy treatment; in the tenth minute of the resultant stoppage time, Chris Wood scored a winning goal for Birmingham. Pablo had replaced the injured Curtis Davies in the starting eleven, but the concussion sustained at Brugge gave Davies time to regain fitness and his undisputed starting place alongside Steven Caldwell in central defence. After Caldwell's season ended early through injury, Pablo returned to the team for the last few games, including the play-off semi-final defeat, and finished the 62-game season with 17 starts, of which only 7 came in the league.", "In later years, he used his experience: in 2012, the Birmingham Mail suggested that, in contrast to the \"more aggressive and animated\" Steven Caldwell, \"Pablo tends to be subtle in his positioning and tackling, he likes to read the game rather than go head-to-head in a gladiatorial battle\"."]}, {"page": "Paul Robinson (footballer, born December 1978)", "response": ["After training with MLS side Toronto FC and then with Championship club Birmingham City, Robinson signed a one-month contract with the latter in September 2012 after injuries had left the club with only two fit senior defenders.

After four appearances, and with the team still weakened in defence by injury, he was given a second month's contract, and then a further two months after left-back David Murphy suffered knee damage. When that deal expired, and despite the club's financial difficulties, his contract was extended until the end of the season.

In a match against Houston Dynamo he passed to Terry Dunfield, who scored, and at the end of the game said he was \"delighted\" with the result. Manager Paul Mariner named O'Dea team captain in September, succeeding the injured Torsten Frings. The following month, he was unable to play a match against Montreal Impact due to a thigh injury sustained during World Cup qualifying play for Ireland. In O'Dea's first season for Toronto, he played nine times as Toronto finished tenth in the Eastern Conference. O'Dea was employed at left back for the 2013 season after the regular player at that position was injured. According to him, it had been two years since he had previously played left back. O'Dea scored his first goal for Toronto on 3 July 2013 in a 3\u20133 home draw with Canadian rivals Montreal Impact. Because of his \"keen sense of positioning and timing\" against Sporting Kansas City, he was named to the Team of the Week for 12 March. Originally part of a transfer (a \"win-win for both parties\", according to head coach Ryan Nelsen, since O'Dea was the highest-paid player in the league), he was released by Toronto on 18 July 2013 to sign with FC Metalurh Donetsk. Club president Kevin Payne wished him luck and hoped he would return in the future.

Steve Cotterill praised Carlisle's character for playing the next day in the 1\u20131 draw with Crystal Palace.
