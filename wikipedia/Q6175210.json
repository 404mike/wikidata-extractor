Although speculated to be in the role of Director of Football or General Manager, the job is thought to be more restricted, involving transfers, scouting and youth development, alongside simultaneous appointment of Tony Jimenez as Vice-President (Player Recruitment) and Jeff Vetere as Technical Co-ordinator, following the earlier shock return of first team manager Kevin Keegan. Keegan had previously expressed disquiet with the concept of a Director of Football, both in commenting about the previous Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce, and latterly the proposition of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley appointing one during his tenure at the club."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["Shortly after his appointment, Dennis Wise left his position as manager at Leeds United to become director of football at Newcastle.

Further appointments saw Tony Jimenez join the club as the vice-president of player recruitment and Jeff Vetere as technical co-ordinator. The idea was to complete a continental-style management structure working in support of Keegan, with Wise and Vetere making the initial assessment before calling in Jimenez to do the deal.", "*29 January 2008: Dennis Wise was appointed as Executive Director or Football alongside Tony Jimenez as Vice President of Player Recruitment and Jeff Vetere as Technical Co-ordinator."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. managers", "response": ["Keegan's return to the club was greeted with much fanfare, and the team made a positive start with a comfortable win over Stoke City in an FA Cup third-round replay.

Earlier that day, the appointments of Dennis Wise as Executive Director of Football, Tony Jimenez as Vice President of Player Recruitment and Jeff Vetere as Technical Co-ordinator were announced. These men were to become very controversial to manager and fans alike. In the league, things were not much better, as they failed to win a match until March, but still bettered the previous season's finish by one place. In the summer transfer window, Keegan brought in Argentine internationals Fabricio Coloccini and Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez, but the club were unable to keep James Milner, as he left to join Aston Villa. Milner's departure already caused conflict between Keegan and the board, but on transfer deadline day, two players that he was not aware of, Xisco and Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez arrived at the club, with the former player paraded at St. James' by Wise. Keegan once again resigned as manager, citing a lack of control in transfers and boardroom interference. Fans were furious over his exit, and thus, and their anger was directed at Ashley and his advisors, a feeling that has never truly gone away under the Londoner's ownership of the club. Ashley would put Newcastle up for sale in the wake of Keegan's exit, but no one came close to what he was asking."]}, {"page": "Vetere", "response": ["*Jeff Vetere (born 1966), English football executive"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["The club appointed Jeff Vetere as director of football, and Redknapp agreed to stay on as manager for another year.
