O'Callaghan and the rest of the staff of the club became free agents after the winding up of the club in February 2010. He turned out for the club in a pre-season friendly at Crosshaven, but decided against playing for his local club due to the uncertainty surrounding their future. George signed for Waterford United on 8 April 2010. He made his debut in the away day defeat to Monaghan United. In his second game for the club he scored a 35-yard wonder goal against Tramore in the Munster Cup.

The Oriel Park side posted a fifth-place finish in 2009, though at the end of the season two sides above them (Derry and Cork City) were demoted. Burns missed just two league games all season, and scored against former club Sligo at the Showgrounds, and against Shamrock Rovers at the Tallaght Stadium. Prior to the start of the 2010 season, Burns had been training with Shamrock with the aim of joining them, but after the signing of Dan Murray Burns was not going to be offered a contract, so he re-signed for Dundalk and was named as captain. He went on to play 27 games in league and cup, forming a defensive partnership with Garry Breen, scoring once in a home defeat to Bray Wanderers. At the end of the season, the \"Lilywhites\" finished sixth; Burns was offered another contract by Dundalk, but once again delayed in signing the contract to 'keep his options open'."]}, {"page": "2008 Setanta Sports Cup", "response": ["*  Dan Murray (Cork City)"]}, {"page": "List of Cork City F.C. players", "response": ["*Dan Murray"]}, {"page": "League of Ireland Player of the Month", "response": ["|Dan Murray"]}, {"page": "2010 Shamrock Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["The club made a number of signings during the off-season and preseason in an effort to strengthen the squad.
