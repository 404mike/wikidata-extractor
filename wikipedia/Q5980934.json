Jagger was succeeded as Keeper by Sir George White in 1988, who served for thirty years through to 2018, in which time the museum and archive collection was again expanded. The major acquisitions in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century were the Hurle-Bath and Hurle-Bradley watch collections, and the purchase of a significant cache of original John Harrison manuscript documents. With a major bequest by noted collector and Past-Master of the Company Reginald Gowan Beloe TD, the funds were available for a major rebuild of the museum, which reopened with a new and enlarged display organized by White at Guildhall Library in 2001. When its lease finally expired at Guildhall, White was instrumental in securing the offer by Ian Blatchford of a newly designed gallery at the Science Museum, which it now occupies under a thirty-year lease. The collection was moved over the course of 2014\u201315, and the new gallery was opened by the Princess Royal on 22 October 2015.
