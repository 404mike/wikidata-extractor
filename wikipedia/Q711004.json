It 'should not shun identity politics but instead must work through it and learn from it,\u2019 because it is the 'primary vehicle for struggle within and against the republic of property since identity itself is based on property and sovereignty.'\u201d In the same exchange in Artforum between Harvey and Micheal Hardt and Antonio Negri, Hardt and Negri attempt to correct Harvey in a concept that is important within the argument of Commonwealth. As such, they state that \"We instead define the concept of singularity, contrasting it to the figure of the individual on the one hand and forms of identity on the other, by focusing on three aspects of its relationship to multiplicity: Singularity refers externally to a multiplicity of others; is internally divided or multiple; and constitutes a multiplicity over time - that is, a process of becoming.\""]}, {"page": "European Social Forum", "response": ["* Great success of London ESF, Alex Callinicos, Socialist Worker, 23 October 2004"]}, {"page": "International Socialists (Canada)", "response": ["A united steering committee slate was put forward and elected at the 1987 convention of the IS, addressed by Alex Callinicos, leading member of the SWP.

In a debate with Bhaskar, the well-known Marxist Alex Callinicos identified him as \"a significant contributor to contemporary Marxist thought, broadly understood\". In the same discussion Bhaskar endorsed some key elements of Marx's thought, including his explanatory account of the deep structures of the capitalist mode of production. It is clear that he admired Marx as a philosopher of emancipation and he both drew on and built on aspects of this work, at least up to and including the period of dialectical critical realism. Yet in the same debate with Callinicos he refers to \"The Marxists\" as if the term did not include himself, criticising them for neglecting the role of women in domestic labour. When he does pin his colours to a political flag, it is the more general flag of socialism. And despite his endorsement in the debate with Callinicos he rarely pays much attention to the less philosophical aspects of Marx's work including political economy and class politics. It might be fairer to see his work as intersecting with the Marxist tradition rather than as part of it. Notably, Bhaskar embraces methodological individualism in his TMSA model of structure and agency. And yet, Marx was an ardent opponent of such methodological individualism, calling adherents to the view \"Robinsonades\" a term of disparagement associating scholars who privilege the individual over institutional contexts with Robinson Crusoe.  Bhaskar never explains why he embraces some features of Marx but rejects the essential Marxist position that institutional contexts are more important than the ideas that inhabit the heads of individual social agents.
