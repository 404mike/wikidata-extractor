A third candidate, Nelson Palmer, subsequently entered the contest, claiming to be of \"independent of party\", but representing the labouring classes. The Conservatives secured a large majority at the election, and Bayley was one of many Liberal MPs to lose their seats. Dalbiac secured a majority of 693 votes over Bayley. Palmer's intervention had no effect, as he received only 32 votes.

They have different ideas on how to defeat the Templars: Jacob advocates that they take the fight straight to the Templars, while Evie insists that they find the Piece of Eden first. They agree to begin liberating the various boroughs of London by defeating Templar-controlled gangs, sabotaging Templar-controlled businesses, assassinating high ranking Templars, and building up their own criminal gang called the Rooks. Along the way, they encounter several allies who are fictional versions of real world historical figures who were active during the time period, including Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Frederick Abberline, Alexander Graham Bell, Florence Nightingale, Edward Hodson Bayley, Arthur Conan Doyle, Duleep Singh, and Queen Victoria. The twins gradually eliminate Starrick's lieutenants over the course of the game's narrative, leading to a final confrontation with Starrick himself and the eventual liberation of London in its entirety from Templar control."]}]}}
