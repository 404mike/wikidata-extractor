When Sadie confronts him, Cain threatens to tell Matthew as well so Sadie tells Ashley that Cain got Jasmine pregnant. The Dingles throw him out and allow Debbie to return. Cain leaves the village, unaware that he has damaged the show home's gas pipe. Despite Jimmy's temporary repair, the house explodes and kills Dawn Woods (Julia Mallam), Noreen Bell (Jenny Tomasin) and David Brown (Peter Alexander). Cain tells the police that he killed Alice so Samson will not lose both parents and his family forgive him (including Debbie), and Sadie bails him out. They plan revenge on Tom and Matthew King (Matt Healy) by plotting to kidnap Tom. Debbie tells Cain that Sadie paid for Jasmine's abortion; after a violent confrontation, Cain follows Sadie and kidnaps her and Tom. Chas (Lucy Pargeter) confronts him but he denies any knowledge of Tom and Sadie's disappearance. With the police closing in, Cain takes them to an abandoned factory and switches cars. They follow him to a quarry, where Cain sends his car over a cliff (with Tom and Sadie supposedly inside). While the police search the lake, Cain disguises himself as an officer. After shooting Sadie, Cain forces Tom to get Chas to deliver the ransom. Debbie begs Cain to let her go with him and they part in tears. Cain gives some of the ransom money to an old woman, asking her to post it to Debbie. Surprised by the woman's honesty, Cain realises he wants to change. At the airport, he gets on a plane and leaves Sadie behind, telling her that he does not want to continue as he was. He leaves Debbie a message that he has left Sadie, asking her to ignore what others say and telling her that he loves her more than he shows. On her 18th birthday, Cain sends her a silver watch."]}, {"page": "Luddendenfoot", "response": ["* The actor Peter Alexander, who starred in Emmerdale Farm and numerous pantomimes in Yorkshire, lives here.
