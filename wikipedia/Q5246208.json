He was the first Test cricketer to be both the son and grandson of Test cricketers. He was educated at Old Swinford Hospital and then Royal Grammar School Worcester where he excelled at rugby union and cricket.\nHe played for Worcestershire's second team in 1989, and played as a professional for Leycett Cricket Club based in Leycett just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, but his senior debut was in 1991 after he had moved to Middlesex. Clive Lloyd helped him a lot in those early years. In 1993 he moved counties again, this time to Kent. Whilst at Kent he was selected for England, playing Test and ODI cricket between 1996 and 1999. One of his greatest moments was when he won the Man of the Match award for his performance in the 4th Ashes Test in 1998 at Melbourne: Australia was making light work of chasing a target of 175, before Headley took four wickets in three overs to reduce Australia from 130/3 to 140/7; he finished with 6/60 in the innings and England won by 12 runs, their only Test victory on that tour. Due to injury he retired from cricket in 2001.\nHe played club cricket for Upchurch Cricket Club in Upchurch, Kent and is a cricket coach for Stamford School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 27", "response": ["*  1970   \u2013 Dean Headley, English cricketer and coach"]}, {"page": "Royal Grammar School Worcester", "response": ["*Dean Headley (born 1970) Former England International Cricketer"]}, {"page": "Graeme Hick", "response": ["Hick ended up playing in four Tests, but he had a rather poor series overall, averaging 25, although his defiant 68 in a losing cause at Perth stuck in the memory and his 39 and 60 contributed significantly to England's 12-run win at Melbourne (even if Dean Headley's 6\u201360 was more remarked upon).
