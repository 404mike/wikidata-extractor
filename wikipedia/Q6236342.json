It had been in the possession of his nephews A. I and J. H. Oliver of Cowandilla, South Australia.He died in East Lothian on 1 December 1873 and was buried in Inveresk parish churchyard.

In that time, in exchange for 78 total casualties, the Heavy Brigade inflicted 270 casualties on the Russian cavalry, including Major-General Khaletski. More importantly, the Scots Greys helped rout a Russian cavalry division, ending the threat to Campbell's Highlanders, and with it the threat to the British supply base. With the rest of the Heavy Brigade, the Scots Greys could only look on as Lord Cardigan lead the Light Brigade on their ill-fated charge. As the Scots Greys returned to the British lines, they passed Colonel Campbell and the 93rd Highlanders. Campbell called out to the Scots Greys, \"Greys, gallant Greys, I am sixty-one years of age, but were I young again, I should be proud to serve in your ranks.\" Not only did Campbell recognise their achievement, so did the Crown. Two members of the Scots Greys, Regimental Sergeant Major John Grieve and Private Henry Ramage, were among the first to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on 25 October.Adrian Mather, \"How Lothian troops led the charge to glory at the Battle of Balaclava\", Scotsman.com, 22 October 2004 retrieved on 25 October 2009.
