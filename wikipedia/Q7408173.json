He scored 17 goals in 46 appearances in the Football League playing for Birmingham, Norwich City and Walsall.Smith was born in Pelsall, which was then in Staffordshire. He played for Walsall LMS before joining Birmingham in 1930. He scored twice on his debut against local rivals Aston Villa, and finished the 1931\u201332 season with ten goals from 15 league games, but the following season Bob Gregg regained his place alongside Joe Bradford in attack. Under George Liddell, who took over from Leslie Knighton as manager, Smith played rarely, and in 1934 he followed Knighton to Chelsea. He failed to make the first team at Chelsea, and a year later moved on to Norwich City, but six months produced only one league appearance, so he returned to the Midlands with Walsall in January 1936. At the end of that season he moved into non-league football with Stourbridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sam Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["Sam Smith (born 1992) is an English singer and songwriter.", "Sam Smith may also refer to:", "*Sam Smith (actor) (born 1989), English child actor", "*Sam Smith (Australian actor), known for Jirga (2018)", "*Sam Smith (artist) (born 1980), Australian artist", "*Sam Smith (painter) (1918\u20131999), American painter", "*Sam Smith (journalist) (born 1937), American journalist and activist", "*Sam Smith (sportswriter) (born 1948), American sports journalist for the Chicago Tribune", "*Sam Smith (American politician) (1922\u20131995), state legislator from Washington", "*Sam Smith (Australian politician), Australian union official and politician", "*Sam Smith (born 1988), reality television personality known for his appearance on the 21st season of Big Brother", "*Sam Smith (footballer, born 1904) (1904\u20131988), English footballer with Cardiff City and Port Vale", "*Sam Smith (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u20131994), English footballer with Birmingham, Norwich City and Walsall", "*Sam Smith (footballer, born 1998), English footballer for Cambridge United", "*Sam Smith (rugby league), British rugby league footballer", "*Sam Smith (basketball, born 1944), American basketball player (ABA)", "*Sam Smith (basketball, born 1955), American basketball player (NBA)", "*Sam Smith (rugby union) (born 1990), English rugby union player", "*Sam Smith (tennis) (born 1971), British tennis player", "* Sam Smith (psychologist) (1929\u20132012), Canadian academic", "* Sam Smith (businesswoman) (born 1974), British CEO of FinnCap", "*Samuel Smith Old Brewery, commonly known as Sam Smith's"]}, {"page": "Sam Smith (footballer born 1909)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Smith (footballer, born 1909) "]}]}}
