Brainin and Schidlof met in a British internment camp at Prees Heath before being transferred to the Isle of Man; many Jewish refugees were confined by the British as \"enemy aliens\" upon seeking refuge in the UK.  Brainin was released after a few months, but Schidlof remained in the camp, where he met Nissel. Finally Schidlof and Nissel were released, and the three of them were able to study with violin teacher Max Rostal, who taught them free of charge. It was through Rostal that they met cellist Martin Lovett (3 March 1927 \u2013 29 April 2020), and in 1947 they formed the Brainin Quartet, which was renamed the Amadeus Quartet in 1948.", "The quartet disbanded in 1987 upon the death of the violist Peter Schidlof.  When the quartet was founded in 1947, the four members decided that, if one of the musicians either left the quartet or died, he would not be replaced and the quartet would disband.  Forty years later, true to their word, the quartet disbanded upon Schidlof's death (of a heart attack, at 65).  Brainin died on 10 April 2005 and Nissel on 21 May 2008.

One can  hit the bow hard on a Montagnana cello while playing, and the sound will continue to come out and become more interesting.

Following the start of  World War II in September 1939 and enactment of Defence Regulation 18B, he was interned in Onchan Internment Camp on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien.  He was interned from August 1939 to April 1941.  It was while he was interned that he first met Norbert Brainin and Siegmund Nissel.  After years of internment, like Brainin and Nissel, Schidlof became a pupil of Max Rostal, and it was Rostal who became the mentor of the Amadeus and persuaded Schidlof, who had been a violinist, to become a viola player.  With Martin Lovett as cellist, the Amadeus gave their first concert at the Wigmore Hall in 1948.  Schidlof\u2019s separate contribution to the Amadeus is difficult to assess, so much were the four a team, although his nickname \"Eagle ears\" shows his particular insistence on technical accuracy.  His calm, questing manner and his close knowledge of a wide range of music beyond the chamber music repertory, combined with his cultivated and kind manner as a person, were an important part of the quartet's chemistry."]}, {"page": "Horacio Lavandera", "response": ["Lavandera won his first competitions in his youth, including the 10th Competition 'Meeting of Children and Young Musicians' (C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina), and the V\u00ba Biennial Youth Competition 99/00, the latter including a jury composed of Martin Lovett, Malcolm Binns, and Elizabeth Robson."]}, {"page": "Siegmund Nissel", "response": ["During World War II, Nissel was interned as a \"friendly enemy alien\" in Onchan Camp on the Isle of Man where he met the violist Peter Schidlof and later the violinist Norbert Brainin.
