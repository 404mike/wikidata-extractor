He won every domestic trophy during nine years with Newcastle.\nHe went on to manage Tottenham Hotspur on two separate occasions as well as Middlesbrough. He was the longest serving manager at Tottenham (however, both his stints were interrupted by world wars, therefore he managed fewer years of normal football) and led Spurs to an FA Cup win in 1921, becoming the first man to win the competition as a player and a manager.", "link_mentions": {}}}
