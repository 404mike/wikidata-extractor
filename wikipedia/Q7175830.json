He won every domestic trophy during his nine years with Newcastle United.\nHe went on to manage Tottenham Hotspur on two occasions as well as Middlesbrough. He was the longest serving manager at Tottenham (however, both his stints were interrupted by world wars, therefore he managed fewer years of normal football) and led Spurs to an FA Cup win in 1921, becoming the first man to win the competition as a player and a manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 1", "response": ["*1951 \u2013 Peter McWilliam, Scottish-English footballer and manager (b. 1878)"]}, {"page": "September 21", "response": ["*1878 \u2013 Peter McWilliam, Scottish-English footballer and manager (d. 1951)"]}, {"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["In 1903\u201304, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their \"artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing\". Long after his retirement, Peter McWilliam, the team's defender at the time, said, \"The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and further more, beat them at a trot.\" Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; 1904\u201305, 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309. In 1904\u201305, they nearly did the double, losing to Aston Villa in the 1905 FA Cup Final. They were beaten again the following year by Everton in the 1906 FA Cup Final.

It hosted its first international fixture on 6 March 1911, a 2\u20132 draw against Scotland in front of 17,000 spectators in the 1910\u201311 British Home Championship. The Times described the ground as \"primitive\" and reported that it had contributed to the poor standard of play. During its formative years, the pitch sometimes bore signs of its former use as a rubbish tip with debris such as glass often rising to the surface. The club paid players 6d an hour to arrive early before matches and help clear the pitch of objects. This approach was not always successful; Scottish international Peter McWilliam suffered a gash to his leg in the first international fixture that ended his playing career, and Wales' Billy Meredith also suffered a cut knee during the match. Cardiff's Jack Evans was scarred for life in a similar incident in a later match when a piece of glass cut his knee. In the early years at the stadium, the ground contained only one changing room and washing area, meaning home and away teams shared facilities. This continued until a separate dressing room was constructed in 1913. A local primary school, originally named Virgil Street Board School, adopted the name of the ground in 1911, becoming Ninian Park Primary School."]}]}}
