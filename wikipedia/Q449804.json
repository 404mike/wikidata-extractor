Billed as \"The Only Band That Matters\", they also contributed to the  and new wave movements that emerged in the wake of punk and employed elements of a variety of genres including reggae, dub, funk, ska, and rockabilly. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Joe Strummer, lead guitarist and vocalist Mick Jones, bassist Paul Simonon, and drummer Nicky \"Topper\" Headon.

Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who would assist them as they tried out potential new members.

With this technique, Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the eighth note of each bar, but he \"anticipates the harmony by shifting the tonality\" before the guitar chords do. This gives the music a feeling of \"forward motion\".Jobling (2014), p. 243 In the band's early years, Clayton had no formal musical training,McCormick (2006), pp. 30, 34 and he generally played simple bass parts in  time consisting of steady eighth notes emphasising the roots of chords. Over time, he incorporated influences from Motown and reggae into his playing style, and as he became a better timekeeper, his playing became more melodic. Flanagan said that he \"often plays with the swollen, vibrating bottom sound of a Jamaican dub bassist, covering the most sonic space with the smallest number of notes\". Clayton relies on his own instincts when developing basslines, deciding whether to follow the chord progressions of the guitars or play a counter-melody, and when to play an octave higher or lower.
