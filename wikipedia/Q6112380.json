He declared that Ninian Park had \"the making of the finest football ground in the country\" and allowed Cardiff City to join the Southern League's Second Division. Cardiff held two trial matches at the ground, the club's professional players competing against its amateur players in preparation for the opening match. The new ground was officially opened at 5:00\u00a0pm on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, reigning champions of the Football League First Division, that attracted a crowd of around 7,000 people. The match began with a ceremonial kick-off performed by Lord Ninian and ended in a 2\u20131 defeat for Cardiff. Jack Evans became the first player to score for the club at the ground. The first competitive match played at Ninian Park was the opening match of the 1910\u201311 season, which took place three weeks later on 24 September 1910. The match ended in a 4\u20131 victory for Cardiff over Ton Pentre and attracted a crowd of around 8,000. In November, a larger timber stand that could hold up to 3,000 spectators was built at the Canton end of the ground. Several players who worked as labourers in their spare time helped to complete construction. The stand was extended three years later to cover the length of the pitch.", "Less than a year after it opened, Ninian Park was chosen as the new home ground for the Wales national football team, replacing Cardiff Arms Park. It hosted its first international fixture on 6 March 1911, a 2\u20132 draw against Scotland in front of 17,000 spectators in the 1910\u201311 British Home Championship. The Times described the ground as \"primitive\" and reported that it had contributed to the poor standard of play. During its formative years, the pitch sometimes bore signs of its former use as a rubbish tip with debris such as glass often rising to the surface. The club paid players 6d an hour to arrive early before matches and help clear the pitch of objects. This approach was not always successful; Scottish international Peter McWilliam suffered a gash to his leg in the first international fixture that ended his playing career, and Wales' Billy Meredith also suffered a cut knee during the match. Cardiff's Jack Evans was scarred for life in a similar incident in a later match when a piece of glass cut his knee. In the early years at the stadium, the ground contained only one changing room and washing area, meaning home and away teams shared facilities. This continued until a separate dressing room was constructed in 1913. A local primary school, originally named Virgil Street Board School, adopted the name of the ground in 1911, becoming Ninian Park Primary School."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Jack Evans (disambiguation), multiple people", "**Jack Evans (rugby player) (1871\u20131924), Welsh rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s ", "**Jack Evans (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u20131971), Welsh international footballer", "**Jack Evans (footballer, born 1891) (1891\u20131988), Australian rules footballer for Melbourne", "**Jack Evans (American football) (born 1906), American football player", "**Jack Evans (footballer, born 1908) (1908\u20131960), Australian rules footballer", "**Jack Evans (rugby), Welsh rugby union, and rugby league footballer who played in the 1940s and 1950s", "**Jack Evans (ice hockey) (1928\u20131996), Canadian ice hockey player and coach in the National Hockey League", "**Jack Evans (Australian politician) (1928\u20132009), Australian Senator", "**Jack Evans (footballer, born 1930), Australian rules footballer for St Kilda", "**Jack Evans (D.C. politician) (born 1953), member of the Council of the District of Columbia", "**Jack Evans (musician) (born 1953), Reverend Zen drummer and composer", "**Jack Evans (born 1982), American professional wrestler", "**Jack Evans (footballer, born 1993), English footballer", "*Jack Evans (EastEnders)"]}, {"page": "Bartley Wilson", "response": ["In 1910, Cardiff City became a professional club, joining the Southern Football League.

If they won the game Cardiff would be guaranteed the First Division title. The match was goalless after 70 minutes, when a goal-bound shot from Gill was blocked by the hand of a Birmingham defender resulting in a penalty being given. The club's usual penalty taker Jack Evans had missed recent attempts, while Gill was reluctant to take it. Davies instead stepped in to take the first penalty of his senior career. His teammate Fred Keenor later described the attempt, noting \"There is no doubt that the excitement and the knowledge that so much depended on the shot unnerved Len a little. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been a gift goal, but Len Davies muffed the kick and the ball rolled gently to the goalkeeper, who calmly gathered and made an easy clearance.\" The game eventually ended goalless while their nearest rivals Huddersfield Town won 3\u20130 and secured the title courtesy of goal average.
