He was born in Bristol.\nBird was a tail-end right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. Before turning professional Bird played club cricket for Optimists CC (now known as Bristol CC) where he was one of the opening bowlers for the Optimists CC team that won the National Knockout Cup final at Lords in 1992, finishing the final with figures of 0/25 from 9 overs. After appearing in one second eleven match for Gloucestershire, he joined Somerset's staff for the 1994 season.\nIn his first season in professional cricket, Bird made a greater impact in one day cricket than in first-class cricket.

He played in five List A games during his first season - going at a miserly 4.5 runs an over in those games.
