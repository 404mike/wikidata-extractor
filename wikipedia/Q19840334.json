Hobart took to the animal and decided to adopt \"The Desert Rats\" as a nickname for the division. The shoulder flash was designed by the wife of his successor, Major-General Michael O'Moore Creagh, using a jerboa from Cairo Zoo as a model. The resulting shoulder patches were made of scarlet thread. These were unofficial; the War Office did not adopt the flashes until the summer of 1943 and then redesigned them to look, in the opinion of Leakey, more like a kangaroo than a jerboa. The colour was also changed to black.Rea Leakey, Leakey\u2019s Luck, paperback edition 2002, pp 23\u201325n; photographs of original and redesigned flashes between pp. 102\u2013103."]}, {"page": "Nigel Leakey", "response": ["Leakey was born in Kiganjo, Kenya to English parents.
