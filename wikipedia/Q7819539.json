However, he was always understudy to Peter Bonetti whilst with the west London side, meaning he made just 11 appearances in four years. \nHughes won two Scottish under-23 caps while at Chelsea.Hughes was transferred to Aston Villa for \u00a312,500 in May 1971. Hughes played sixteen times for Aston Villa in 1971-72, when Villa just pipped Brighton & Hove Albion for the Third Division championship. Hughes then lost his place at Aston Villa to Jim Cumbes. He went on loan to Brighton for a month in February 1973 when Brighton were struggling at the bottom of the Second Division. Hughes played three games for Brighton, whose manager Pat Saward was keen to sign him as permanently.\nBrighton could not match the asking price, and Hughes was transferred to Hereford United in August 1973 for \u00a315,000. He spent nine seasons with Hereford United, and was a part of the side which won the Third Division championship in 1975-76. He was later caretaker manager of the club during the 1982-83 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Hughes (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Tommy Hughes (athlete) (born 1960), Irish long-distance runner", "* Tommy Hughes (Australian footballer) (1886\u20131981), Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton", "* Tommy Hughes (baseball) (1919\u20131990), professional baseball player who played pitcher", "* Tommy Hughes (footballer, born 1947), Scottish former football goalkeeper", "* Tommy Hughes (footballer, born 2000), English footballer who plays for Ipswich Town"]}, {"page": "Winston White", "response": ["Manager Frank Lord failed to take the club out of the Fourth Division re-election zone in 1979\u201380 or 1980\u201381, though the Edgar Street outfit did reach tenth in 1981\u201382, before finishing bottom of the Football League in 1982\u201383 under Tommy Hughes.
