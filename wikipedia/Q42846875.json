He later moved to Seattle to take up a position as an executive at Microsoft, advising on fonts to be included with Windows. Many of the release notes accompanying Microsoft typefaces were written by him. While in Washington, he self-published the book Types Best Remembered/Types Best Forgotten on good and bad choices of font.He married Abigail Scully in the United States and had four children. After retiring from Microsoft in 1997, he ran his fine press brand, the Parsimony Press, in Huntspill, Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Georgia (typeface)", "response": ["Microsoft publicly released the initial version of the font on 1\u00a0November 1996 as part of the core fonts for the Web collection, and later bundled it with the Internet Explorer 4.0 supplemental font pack: these releases made it available for installation on both Windows and Macintosh computers. This made it a popular choice for web designers, as pages specifying Georgia as a font choice would display identically on both types if users installed the core fonts package (or later Internet Explorer), simplifying development and testing. Its creators also produced Verdana at the same time, the first Microsoft sans-serif screen font, for the same purposes. Some early public releases of Georgia included number designs between upper- and lower-case, similar to those later released with Miller. Carter was asked by Robert Norton, Microsoft's type director, to change these to text, a decision that Carter later considered an improvement."]}, {"page": "Mary Norton (author)", "response": ["Kathleen Mary Pearson was the daughter of a physician and grew up in a Georgian house at the end of the High Street in Leighton Buzzard. The house now forms part of Leighton Middle School, known within the school as The Old House, and was reportedly the setting of her novel The Borrowers.

The font was named by Norton and, according to Microsoft, received its name from Westminster Bank Limited (now NatWest) in the United Kingdom because it helped fund the font's production. The font was included with Microsoft software after Microsoft hired Norton."]}, {"page": "Haettenschweiler", "response": ["An early reuse of the design was in the German young peoples' magazine Twen. Microsoft's history of the font, possibly written by Robert Norton (see below) notes that after Lettera 4 was published the design 'was immediately picked up by designers at Paris Match who cut up pictures of it to make headlines' until it was publicly released. Similar methods were also used by British designers, as it was not available in Britain.", "According to Microsoft's release notes, the Haettenschweiler font in common modern use descends from a later phototypesetting adaptation by the company Photoscript, who created a lower-case for it; its owner Robert Norton would later become Microsoft's font consultant and may also have written Microsoft's unsigned article on its history. The font Haettenschweiler now bundled with much Microsoft software is a digitisation credited to Eraman Ltd. and Monotype Imaging. Haettenschweiler himself did not receive royalties for the design, and commented: \"I never received a single cent, but at least they named it after me.\""]}, {"page": "Carl Dair", "response": ["** Raleigh a 1977 revival of Cartier by Robert Norton, available as digital type from URW++, ParaType, Bitstream Systems, Adobe Systems, Linotype, and Monotype."]}, {"page": "Britannic (typeface)", "response": ["Since Stephenson Blake did not continue operations into digital fonts, a variety of digitisations of different weights and widths of Britannic have been released by different companies. Some releases include an all-capitals condensed weight. The bold weight, digitised by URW, is included with some Microsoft software such as Office. A wry commentary on the design, presumably by Microsoft's typography manager Robert Norton, adds:This interesting face always excites heated opinions. Some, like the writer, have always put Britannic Bold firmly in the category called 'Monumentally Overrated'. Others swear by it. In fact, a survey conducted at great expense (among three people) found that two out of three thought Britannic Bold was magnificent. And it can't be all bad, having started life at the renowned Stephenson Blake type foundry, and to have outlasted the same foundry's Rothbury, which to most people is probably indistinguishable..."]}, {"page": "Cartier (typeface)", "response": ["In 1977 a revival of Cartier was produced under the name Raleigh by Robert Norton."]}, {"page": "Robert Norton", "response": ["Robert Norton may refer to:", "*Robert Norton (Leicester MP) represented Leicester (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Robert Norton (British politician), British Conservative politician", "*Robert Norton (parliamentarian), MP for Warwick (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Robert Norton (Virginia politician), former slave and member of the Virginia House of Delegates ", "*Robert Norton (boxer)", "*Robert Norton (typographer) (1929\u20132001), printer and publisher"]}, {"page": "Frederic W.
