A decent run of form had ignited the careers of such younger players as Daryl Clare, Danny Butterfield and Jack Lester who were becoming an integral part of the Blundell Park set-up. The Mariners went on to dump Burnley out of the Football League Trophy Northern section area final, which would see the club book its first trip to Wembley Stadium. The club were drawn against Southern section champions AFC Bournemouth and in a tight game, an equaliser from substitute Kingsley Black took the game into extra time, and in the 112th minute Grimsby secured the game courtesy of a golden goal from Wayne Burnett. This was the first major trophy awarded to the club following its first appearance at Wembley. It took only four weeks for Grimsby to return to the stadium though, this time to face Northampton Town in the Division Two play-off Final. Town won the game 1\u20130 thanks to a first half Kevin Donovan goal which gave the club a historic Wembley double and the Mariners promotion back to Division One.", "|1998|| Kevin Donovan || Daryl Clare"]}, {"page": "Crawley Town F.C.", "response": ["The 2005\u201306 season didn't start well for Crawley as the club found themselves third from bottom and out of the FA Cup after a shock defeat to Braintree Town. Francis Vines was subsequently sacked and replaced by former Chelsea FC manager and player John Hollins and his assistant Alan Lewer. Things got worse for Crawley and as attendances dropped, and so too did the club's income; the club's owners were forced to slash the players' and staff wages by 50% due to lack of funds. Several key players left the club, including captain Ian Simpemba, Simon Wormull and record signing Daryl Clare; it looked certain that relegation was on the cards. However five straight wins through March and April saw the club climb the table to 17th place and beat the drop by 10 points. The club was docked three points at the end of the season for breaching the annual playing budget but this had no effect on the final standings and Crawley's league status was safe. However, they later went into administration, with insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor placed in control of the club."]}, {"page": "John Oster", "response": ["Oster started his career at Grimsby Town and had progressed through the youth ranks at the club and was inducted into the first team in the same youth squad as players such as Danny Butterfield, Matthew Bloomer and Daryl Clare.

However, he didn't make his debut until the 1996\u201397 campaign where he made his debut in a 3\u20131 win away at Charlton Athletic on 26 November 1996. Following Grimsby's relegation from the First Division, Oster was sold by The Mariners, for a fee of \u00a31.5 million that saw him break the club's record transfer sale that was initially held by Gary Croft following his move to Blackburn Rovers for \u00a31 million a year earlier.

The signings of Conal Platt, Adam Miller (who reportedly turned down interest from League One sides Sheffield Wednesday and Bradford City to join the club), and veteran striker Daryl Clare, who arrived for a fee of \u00a310,000,the signing led Ling to claim that his squad was all-but complete."]}, {"page": "Matt Bloomer", "response": ["Bloomer started his career as a trainee with his home town club of Grimsby Town, but failed to make an impact, starting only three games in his four years under contract.
