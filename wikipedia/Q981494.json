After this, he taught there until 1270 when he moved to the University of Paris, where he remained until his death around 1285. He was a moral theologian and a great admirer of the ancient world, incorporating many classical authors into his works. He is often considered a forerunner of later Christian humanists. His works were translated into six languages and were in print before the end of the 15th century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Titivillus", "response": ["Titivillus was a demon said to work on behalfcitation needed for relationship of Belphegor, Lucifer or Satan to introduce errors into the work of scribes. The first reference to Titivillus by name occurred in Tractatus de Penitentia, c. 1285, by Johannes Galensis (John of Wales). Attribution has also been given to Caesarius of Heisterbach. Titivillus has also been described as collecting idle chat that occurs during church service, and mispronounced, mumbled or skipped words of the service, to take to Hell to be counted against the offenders."]}, {"page": "Francesc Eiximenis", "response": ["Francesc Eiximenis was born around 1330, possibly in Girona. When he was very young, he became a Franciscan and his education began in the Franciscan schools of the Kingdom of Aragon. Later, he attended the most important universities of Europe: the University of Oxford and the University of Paris. The University of Oxford influenced him notably, since the Franciscans had there an important school. Thus, several English Franciscans (and British authors in general) are the thinkers who most influenced Eiximenis, such as Robert Grosseteste (whom Eiximenis calls Linconiensis, since he was bishop of Lincoln), John of Wales, Richard Kilvington, Alexander of Hales, Richard of Middleton, Thomas Bradwardine, William of Ockham, and John Duns Scotus.", "* Regiment de la cosa p\u00fablica (Government of the Republic).

He was educated under John of Wales at the University of Bologna. He wrote an important gloss on the Compilatio tertia and the Summa de matrimonio (Summary of Marriage), which was influential to Ramon de Penyafort, as well as the Ordo iudiciarius, completed in 1216, which was the culmination of the procedural literature of the glossators and was translated into both German and French, indicating its importance for medieval legal practice.Rosamond McKitterick et al., The New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. IV (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 136. He supported the emergent doctrine of Papal infallibility and the sect of the Humiliati. He was one of the teachers of Bernard of Botone."]}, {"page": "Curt Wittlin", "response": ["He became a specialist in the edition of medieval translations in Europe of texts by Cicero, Saint Augustine and John of Wales, among others. He also worked on Ramon Llull and on the history of medieval Catalan libraries. The Catalan writer to which he devoted most of his life was Francesc Eiximenis.

On the other hand, it seems that some parts of this book were not written by Eiximenis, and could have been added later. These ones are the famous twenty difficulties, thirty-two beauties and the end of the prologue, together with the end of the epilogue.Wittlin, Curt J. \u201cL\u2019edici\u00f3 del 1499 del Regiment de la cosa p\u00fablica.
