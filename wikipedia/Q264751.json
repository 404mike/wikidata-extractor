McDonnell's casting was also criticised as whitewashing due to Short being physically described in the book series as having nut-brown skin of a coffee complexion. The casting of Nonso Anozie as Butler was also criticised for several reasons: that the character is described as Eurasian who can pass as Japanese and Russian in the book series, and that the character's physical description of terrifying anyone in his presence, combined with his backstory of his family having served the Fowl family for centuries and Anozie's casting, embodies several stereotypes of African Americans, in particular the \"scary black man\" and \"black servant\" tropes."]}, {"page": "Horemheb", "response": ["* Horemheb was portrayed by British actor Nonso Anozie in the 2015 mini-TV series Tut which aired on Spike in the US, and on Channel 5 in the UK."]}, {"page": "Show Boat", "response": ["* In 2011, a two-part version was broadcast on BBC Radio\u00a04 in the Classic Serial spot.
