At MIT, Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy. He described MIT as \"a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.\" In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor. The Chomskys had their first child that same year, a daughter named Aviva. He also published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris\u2013Bloomfield trend in the field. Responses to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline. The linguist John Lyons later asserted that Syntactic Structures \"revolutionized the scientific study of language\". From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.", "McGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the \"cognitive revolution\" in linguistics, and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal, natural science, moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics dominant during the mid-20th century. As such, some have called Chomsky \"the father of modern linguistics\". Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field. By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy, and a Minnesota State University Moorhead poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in cognitive science. In addition, his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in computer science, and he is much cited in computational linguistics."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*John Lyons (Christ's), semanticist"]}, {"page": "Language change", "response": ["All living languages are continually undergoing change. Some commentators use derogatory labels such as \"corruption\" to suggest that language change constitutes a degradation in the quality of a language, especially when the change originates from human error or is a prescriptively discouraged usage. Modern linguistics rejects this concept, since from a scientific point of view such innovations cannot be judged in terms of good or bad. John Lyons notes that \"any standard of evaluation applied to language-change must be based upon a recognition of the various functions a language 'is called upon' to fulfil in the society which uses it\"."]}, {"page": "Syntactic Structures", "response": ["In an early review of the book, American structural linguist Charles F. Voegelin wrote that Syntactic Structures posed a fundamental challenge to the established way of doing linguistic research. He stated that it had the potential to accomplish \"a Copernican revolution\" within linguistics. Another American linguist Martin Joos called the Chomskyan brand of linguistic theory a \"heresy\" within the Bloomfieldian tradition. These early remarks proved to be prescient. American linguist Paul Postal commented in 1964 that most of the \"syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States\" were \"versions of the theory of phrase structure grammars in the sense of Chomsky\". By 1965, linguists were saying that  Syntactic Structures had \"mark[ed] an epoch\", had a \"startling impact\" and created a Kuhnian \"revolution\". British linguist John Lyons wrote in 1966 that \"no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's Syntactic Structures.\" British historian of linguistics R. H. Robins wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's Syntactic Structures was \"probably the most radical and important change in direction in descriptive linguistics and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years\"."]}, {"page": "Linguistic competence", "response": ["Noted linguist John Lyons, who works on semantics, has said: "]}, {"page": "John Lyons", "response": ["John Lyons may refer to: ", "*John Lyons (Antiguan politician) (1760\u20131816), Antiguan politician", "*John Lyons (Royal Navy officer, born 1787) (1787\u20131872), British admiral", "*John Lyons (VC) (1824\u20131867), Irish soldier in the British army, recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*John Lyons (Australian politician) (1885\u20131948), South Australian politician", "*John Lyons (Longford politician), Irish independent / Labour Party politician, represented Longford-Westmeath, 1922\u20131927", "*John Lyons (bishop) (1878\u20131958), Bishop of Ontario, 1932\u20131952", "*John Lyons (ice hockey) (1900\u20131971), United States ice hockey player who competed in the 1924 Winter Olympics", "*John Lyons (hurler) (1923\u20132005), Irish sportsperson", "*John Lyons (trade unionist) (1926\u20132016), British trade union leader", "*John Lyons (linguist) (1932\u20132020), British linguist", "*John Lyons (poet) (born 1933), Trinidad-born poet, artist and educator", "*John Lyons (actor) (born 1943), British actor", "*John Lyons (British politician) (born 1949), Labour Party politician", "*John Lyons (American football coach) (born 1952), American football coach", "*John Lyons (end) (1911\u20131981), American football player", "*John Lyons (footballer) (1956\u20131982), Welsh footballer", "*John Lyons (Dublin politician) (born 1977), Irish Labour politician representing Dublin North West 2011\u20132016", "*John Lyons (horse trainer), author and horse trainer in the field of natural horsemanship", "*John Lyons (journalist), Australian journalist"]}, {"page": "St Bede's College, Manchester", "response": ["* Sir John Lyons \u2013 linguist and semanticist, Master of Trinity Hall Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Semantic field", "response": ["The origin of the field theory of semantics is the lexical field theory introduced by Jost Trier in the 1930s,David Corson, Using English Words, Springer, 1995.  although according to John Lyons it has historical roots in the ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder. In the 1960s Stephen Ullmann saw semantic fields as crystallising and perpetuating the values of society. For John Lyons in the 1970s words related in any sense belonged to the same semantic field, and the semantic field was simply a lexical category, which he described as a lexical field. Lyons emphasised the distinction between semantic fields and semantic networks. In the 1980s Eva Kittay developed a semantic field theory of metaphor. This approach is based on the idea that the items in a semantic field have specific relations to other items in the same field, and that a metaphor works by re-ordering the relations of a field by mapping them on to the existing relations of another field.Josef Judah Stern, Metaphor in Context, MIT Press, 2000, p242.
