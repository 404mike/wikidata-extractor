Indeed, he was so expensive when called upon in 1934 that he took no wicket and conceded 117 runs, and the following year, when he was very disappointing on a leatherjacket-infested Lord's wicket that should have helped him, he is quoted as having said \"You couldn't captain a team of bloody lead soldiers\" to his captain Bob Wyatt.Engel, Matthew S. (editor); Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanack, 134th Edition (1997), pp. 1410-1411 Indeed, Mitchell's tactlessness towards administrators made him quite unpopular with them and may have prejudiced his chances of doing well in representative cricket."]}, {"page": "Reg Sinfield", "response": ["Sinfield's skill as a bowler was slower to blossom because Charlie Parker and Goddard could do almost everything that was required until the end of 1931. Although he took ninety wickets for under twenty apiece in 1930, it was not until 1934 that Sinfield became recognised as a bowler of class. In that year, he headed the Gloucestershire averages and when the pitch helped him could be formidable indeed, as he showed with thirteen wickets against Nottinghamshire and eight for 40 against Leicestershire. The following year, despite the county's other batsmen declining, Sinfield had his best season with the bat, largely because he increased his range of scoring strokes without losing his defensive strength. In August that year he made his highest score, 209 not out against Glamorgan at Cardiff \u2013 and followed that up with a haul of nine wickets for 103."]}, {"page": "Bev Lyon", "response": ["Lyon brought Gloucestershire greater success than the county had seen since the days of W.

Lyon was aided, no doubt, by having Wally Hammond, perhaps England's finest batsman of the time in the side. And the three years of success coincided as well with the last truly effective years of the great slow left-arm bowler Charlie Parker and the first effective years of Parker's successor, the off break bowler Tom Goddard. But the captaincy of Lyon was regarded as a vital factor, and he was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1931. The citation in Wisden suggested that he might be a future captain of England, but that did not happen."]}, {"page": "Australian Imperial Force Touring XI", "response": ["On Wednesday, 27 August, the Australians were at the Clifton College Close Ground and its strong associations with W.

They won the toss and batted, scoring 281 (Charlie Townsend 63, Alf Dipper 61) and then reduced the AIF to 104 for six at close of play. On the second morning, the AIF were all out for 147 and asked to follow on. Gloucestershire's great left arm spinner Charlie Parker did the damage with seven for 70.
