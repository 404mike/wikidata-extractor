Flanagan served with the British Army during World War II, and participated in the liberation of the Nazi-operated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.Following the war, Flanagan was stationed in British Mandate Palestine. Being sympathetic with the emerging state of Israel, on 29 June 1948, Flanagan (along with his tank commander, Harry McDonald) stole two British Cromwell tanks and drove them to Israeli forces in Tel Aviv. These became central to the Israeli Armored Corps. The tanks were hidden in Givatayim and later formed the basis of the Israeli Armored Corps. The Cromwell tanks are currently on display at the Armored Corps Memorial Site and Museum in Latrun. Flanagan is considered one of the most famous deserters from the British Army in Palestine.Flanagan subsequently converted to Judaism, adopted the Hebrew name Michael Peleg and married Ruth Levy, a fellow soldier whom he had met on active service.  They lived in Israel on Kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim.  Flanagan served as a reservist in the 1956 Sinai Campaign, the 1967 Six-Day War, as well as the Yom Kippur War in 1973. He supervised the tank repair unit at the Armored Corps base in Julis throughout this time. After his retirement from the Haganah and the death of his wife he emigrated to Canada. He died on 26 January 2014 and was subsequently buried in Sha\u2019ar HaAmakim cemetery alongside his wife and son.He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor from The Wiesenthal Center in the United States.  The Israeli Defense Forces honored Flanagan for his immense and critical contributions to the formulation of the IDF.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of converts to Judaism", "response": ["* Mike Flanagan, Irish-Israeli soldier"]}, {"page": "Mike Flanagan", "response": ["* Mike Flanagan (American football) (born 1973), American football center", "* Mike Flanagan (baseball) (1951\u20132011), former pitcher and television broadcaster", "* Mike Flanagan (footballer) (born 1952), English former professional footballer and manager", "* Mike Flanagan (Irish-Israeli soldier) (1926\u20132014), British soldier who stole two tanks and deserted to join the Israeli tank corps", "* Mike Flanagan (filmmaker) (born 1978), American film director", "* Mike Flanagan, banjo player for the Flanagan Brothers", "* Mike Flanagan, a character in My Brother's Husband"]}, {"page": "Foxford", "response": ["*Mike Flanagan (1926\u20132014), soldier who assisted the formation of the Israeli armed forces."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2014", "response": ["*Mike Flanagan, 85, British-born Israeli soldier.British deserter who stole tanks for Haganah dies"]}, {"page": "List of Mayo people", "response": ["* Mike Flanagan - Fought with the British Army during World War II before defecting to the Israeli Defence Forces in 1948, where he was a founder of the  Israeli Armored Corps"]}, {"page": "Mike Flanagan (British-Israeli soldier)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Flanagan (Irish-Israeli soldier)"]}]}}
