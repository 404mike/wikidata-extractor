He scored his first goal for the club with an equalising goal in their 1\u20131 draw with Preston North End on 21 March. He then scored in his next game against league leaders Bristol City on 28 March with a 44th minute reply to Marlon Pack's 13th-minute penalty for City.

Players that Still has developed that have gone on to play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle. Dagenham & Redbridge managing director Steve Thompson has stated that Still's ability to do this kept the club consistently able to compete while operating on a far smaller budget than its rivals. Still's reputation for nurturing talent, combined with his vast array of contacts within the game gained through decades of coaching, have also led to highly rated young players from Premier League academies joining his teams on loan. Examples include Marlon Pack and Matt Ritchie at Dagenham, and Cameron McGeehan, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu and Elliot Lee at Luton."]}, {"page": "Marlon", "response": ["*Marlon Pack (born 1991), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Portsmouth F.C.
