At this point (May 2006) Scappaticci has launched no libel actions against media making the allegations. There is also suspicion in Irish republican circles that the real \"Stakeknife\" and/or other British agents have yet to be unmasked, this suspicion was compounded by the revelation that Denis Donaldson was a mole within Sinn F\u00e9in/the Republican movement, and by interviews given by the man calling himself \"Kevin Fulton\" in March 2006."]}, {"page": "Alistair Darling", "response": ["On 28 June 2007, the new Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Darling Chancellor of the Exchequer, a promotion widely anticipated in the media.
