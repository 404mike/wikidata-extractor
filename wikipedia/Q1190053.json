The Wilkinson ADC is based on the comparison of an input voltage with that produced by a charging capacitor. The capacitor is allowed to charge until a comparator determines it matches the input voltage. Then, the capacitor is discharged linearly. The time required to discharge the capacitor is proportional to the amplitude of the input voltage. While the capacitor is discharging, pulses from a high-frequency oscillator clock are counted by a register. The number of clock pulses recorded in the register is also proportional to the input voltage."]}, {"page": "1922 in science", "response": ["* September 5 \u2013 Denys Wilkinson (died 2016), English nuclear physicist."]}, {"page": "Wilkinson (surname)", "response": ["* Denys Wilkinson, British nuclear physicist"]}, {"page": "Samar Mubarakmand", "response": ["He conducted research in experimental physics under Dr. Hussain and built an experimental apparatus for his master's thesis.
