It chronicles the events of Conker the Squirrel, an anthropomorphic red squirrel that made his debut as a playable character in Diddy Kong Racing. \nThe Game Boy Color game is targeted at a family audience. Conker's Bad Fur Day was changed during its development to be based on graphic violence, profanity, and other adult material, which earned the game a Mature rating by the ESRB, with an advisory on its box. A graphically improved but censored version of Conker's Bad Fur Day, along with new multiplayer modes, was released as Conker: Live & Reloaded on June 21, 2005 in North America for the original Xbox. The uncensored Conker's Bad Fur Day was released on Rare Replay and Live & Reloaded has been made backward compatible with the Xbox One.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robin Beanland", "response": ["Robin Beanland (born 27 August 1968 in Leeds, Yorkshire, England) is a British composer of video game music, composing music for numerous Rare titles, such as the Killer Instinct franchise, Conker's Bad Fur Day (which he also co-wrote the screenplay with Chris Seavor), and many others.

In addition to having a narrative to give the titular character a personality, Seavor wanted to make the game \"edgy, in terms of its violence\"; the Stampers loved the idea and moved Seavor up to project lead. Seavor's first action following the meeting was changing the task \"Wasps and the Queen Bee\". Tim Stamper conceived its premise of wasps stealing a beehive, but Seavor noticed no established reasons or punchline behind it. He decided to end it with the beehive having guns shooting at the wasps; the founders loved it and directed the team to \"make more of that\". This set the formula for later missions: an introduction, interaction of the mission, and then an \"extreme punchline\" cutscene as reward for completing the task. It also changed the style of a game to a platformer starring a cute mascot character in an incredibly raunchy world. According to the developers: \"We already had the main character (although he was eventually remodeled) and a good deal of code already written, so the best option seemed to be to change the game's direction. Mature humor was a key element\"."]}, {"page": "Conker: Live & Reloaded", "response": ["* Chris Seavor"]}, {"page": "Conker the Squirrel", "response": ["Conker the Squirrel is an anthropomorphic squirrel starring in various video games, primarily known for his role in Conker's Bad Fur Day.
