On the first day of the 1997\u201398 season, West Ham opened their fixtures with an away game against Barnsley who were playing in the top tier of English football for the first time in 110 years. Lampard came on as a 76th-minute substitute for Eyal Berkovic. Barely a minute later he scored what was the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win for The Hammers having received the ball from Michael Hughes and flicking it past Barnsley goalkeeper David Watson. The season also saw his first hat-trick. On 19 November 1997, West Ham played Walsall in a League Cup, fourth-round game. Lampard's three goals plus another from John Hartson were enough to beat Walsall who responded via a goal from Andy Watson. Lampard made 42 appearances for the 1997\u201398 season in all competitions scoring nine goals."]}, {"page": "David Watson", "response": ["David Watson may refer to:", "* David Watson (Queensland politician) (born 1945), Australian politician", "* David Watson (New South Wales politician) (1870\u20131924), Australian Senator", "* David Watson (footballer, born 1946), English footballer of the 1970s and 1980s, played for Sunderland A.F.C.", "* David Watson (footballer, born 1973), English football goalkeeper of the 1990s, played for Barnsley F.C.", "* David Watson (coach) (born 1976), American football coach", "* David Watson (1920s rugby league) (1900\u20131982), Australian rugby player", "* David Watson (cricketer) (1919\u20131943), English cricketer", "* David Watson (rugby union) (1854\u20131906), Scotland international rugby union player", "* David Watson (actor) (1940\u20132014), American actor of film, television and theatre", "* David Watson (dancer) (born 1968), professional dancer", "* David Watson (artist) (born 1944), English industrial painter", "* David Watson (British musician), record producer, singer and musician", "* David Watson (New Zealand musician) (born 1960), musician and composer from New Zealand", "* David Watson (anarchist) (born 1951), anarchist author", "* David Watson (evangelist) (1933\u20131984), English evangelist and author", "* Sir David Watson (general) (1869\u20131922), Canadian World War I general", "* David Watson (psychologist), American psychologist", "* David Watson (academic) (1949\u20132015), principal of Green Templeton College, Oxford, UK"]}, {"page": "David Watson (goalkeeper)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Watson (footballer, born 1973)"]}, {"page": "David Watson (footballer born 1973)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Watson (footballer, born 1973)"]}]}}
