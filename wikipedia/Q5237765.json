He was signed to replace Alan West, who had been sold on to Millwall. Horton was installed as captain and told to play a more attacking midfield role than he had previously been used to, playing in between a midfield three with Lil Fuccillo and Ricky Hill. He was again promoted into the top-flight, as the \"Hatters\" topped the Second Division table in 1981\u201382 by an eight-point margin, some 18 points clear of fourth-place Sheffield Wednesday. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career, alongside teammates Kirk Stephens, Ricky Hill, and David Moss."]}]}}
