Neither side, in her view, understood the evil Nazism posed. Unlike many on the left, she also distrusted Joseph Stalin. To West, Stalin had a criminal mentality that Communism facilitated.Rebecca West, \"The men we sacrificed to Stalin,\" Sunday Telegraph, n.d. She was outraged when the Allies switched their loyalties as to Yugoslav resistance movements by deciding in 1943 to start backing the Communist-led Partisans led by Tito in Yugoslavia, thus abandoning their support of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks, whom she considered the legitimate Yugoslav resistance. She expressed her feelings and opinions on the Allies' switch in Yugoslavia by writing the satirical short story titled \"Madame Sara's Magic Crystal\", but decided not to publish it upon discussion with Orme Sargent, Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office.It was published posthumously in The Only Poet (1992), edited by Antonia Till, Virago, pp. 167\u201378. Writing in her diary, West mentioned Sargent persuaded her that \"the recognition of Tito was made by reason of British military necessities, and for no other reason\" and following Sargent's claim, she described her decision not to publish the story as an expression of \"personal willingness to sacrifice myself to the needs of my country\". After the war, West's anti-Communism hardened as she saw Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other Eastern and Central European states succumb to Soviet domination."]}, {"page": "Prague uprising", "response": ["The Western Allies' failure to liberate Prague was seen as emblematic of their lack of concern for Czechoslovakia, first demonstrated by the Munich Agreement. It also served as a blow to democratic forces within the country who opposed Czechoslovakia's drift towards communism in the years after the war. It was not forgotten that Stalin had opposed the Munich Agreement, and Prague's liberation by the Red Army turned public opinion in favour of communism. Few Czechs were aware of the demarcation line agreement between the Western Allied and Soviet forces, allowing communists to accuse the American forces of \"having remained a cowardly or cynical onlooker while Prague was struggling for life,\" in the words of Hungarian historian Stephen Kertesz. According to British diplomat Sir Orme Sargent, the Prague uprising was the moment that \"Czechoslovakia was now definitely lost to the West.\""]}, {"page": "Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "response": ["*1946: Sir Orme Sargent (jointly with Sir William Strang, Head of the German Section 1947\u20131949)"]}, {"page": "Holburne Museum", "response": ["Significant acquisitions have greatly increased the Museum's collection of British eighteenth and early nineteenth-century paintings and miniatures.
