His research interests largely centre on the development of artificial evolution as an approach to the design of complex systems. Application domains of interest include evolutionary robotics, evolvable hardware, molecules for pharmaceutical purposes.\nTogether with other Sussex faculty, mainly from the School of Cognitive and Computer Sciences (COGS), he developed the MSc program on Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems (EASy), which was active in the 1990s and 2000s, attracting dozens of students that have contributed to Artificial Life,  evolutionary robotics, cognitive science and other disciplines.\nHarvey's other interests include philosophical approaches to AI and Artificial Life (a non-representational, dynamical systems approach); passive dynamic walking; and Gaia theory. He originally started as a mathematician and philosopher at Cambridge University.\nThe article \"Evolving a Conscious Machine\" in the June 1998 issue of Discover magazine (pp. 72\u201379) overviews Harvey's and Adrian Thompson's work with evolving an FPGA program to recognize tones.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evolutionary robotics", "response": ["In the early 1990s, two separate European groups demonstrated different approaches to the evolution of robot control systems. Dario Floreano and Francesco Mondada at EPFL evolved controllers for the Khepera robot. Adrian Thompson, Nick Jakobi, Dave Cliff, Inman Harvey, and Phil Husbands evolved controllers for a Gantry robot at the University of Sussex.

She earned her bachelor's degree at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University, where she remained for her master's degree and worked as a teacher's assistant. She moved to the United Kingdom for her graduate studies, where she joined the University of Sussex as a doctoral student. At Sussex Ochoa worked on genetic algorithms with Hilary Buxton and Inman Harvey. After graduating she returned to Venezuela, where she was made Associate Professor at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University."]}]}}
