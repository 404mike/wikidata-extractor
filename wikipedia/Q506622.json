He was raised in Edinburgh, and represents Scotland. He represented England as an amateur and won the English Amateur in 1982, turning professional after playing for Great Britain & Ireland in the 1983 Walker Cup.\nOldcorn was medalist at the European Tour final Qualifying School in 1983. He had a steady start to his career on tour before being struck down with ME (also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) in the early 1990s. He returned to form in 1993, to claim his first tour victory in the Turespana Masters Open de Andalucia. Away from the tour he also won the Sunderland of Scotland Masters. Several solid years followed along with another title, the 1995 DHL Jersey Open. The undoubted highlight of his career came in 2001 when he became the oldest winner in the history of the Volvo PGA Championship (although Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez would later beat that record). He finished that season a career best 26th place on the European Tour Order of Merit.\nSince turning 50, Oldcorn has primarily been playing on the senior golf tours, having won twice on the European Senior Tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Montgomerie", "response": ["| Andrew Oldcorn,  Wayne Riley"]}, {"page": "BMW PGA Championship", "response": ["| 2001 || Andrew Oldcorn|| align=\"center\" |272 || align=center|\u221216 || 2 strokes ||  \u00c1ngel Cabrera ||Wentworth Club|| align=\"center\" |544,521"]}, {"page": "Paul Broadhurst", "response": ["| Andrew Oldcorn"]}, {"page": "Irish Open (golf)", "response": ["| align=center|1996 ||  Colin Montgomerie || align=center|279 || align=center|\u22125 || 1 stroke ||  Andrew Oldcorn Wayne Riley || align=center|178,571 || Druids Glen"]}, {"page": "Scottish PGA Championship", "response": ["| 1984 || Ian Young ||  || Dalmahoy || 276 || 5 strokes ||  Andrew Oldcorn || align=center|6,000 || "]}, {"page": "Gordon Brand Jnr", "response": ["| \u00c1ngel Franco,  Andrew Oldcorn, David J.
