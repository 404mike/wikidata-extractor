He followed his father by joining the army and he served with the Royal Field Artillery, but his military career was cut short following a riding accident. French was also a talented artist, something which did not endear him to his father.\nHe succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Ypres following his death on 22 May 1925. During the Second World War he commanded a battalion of the Home Guard. He was succeeded by his son John.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John French", "response": ["* John French, 2nd Earl of Ypres (1881\u20131958), British soldier and artist, son of the 1st Earl", "* John French, 3rd Earl of Ypres (1921\u20131988), British peer, son of John French, 2nd Earl of Ypres"]}, {"page": "French (surname)", "response": ["* John French, 2nd Earl of Ypres (1881\u20131958), English army officer and artist; son of 1st Earl"]}]}}
