As a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish Volunteers, during the Easter Rising Galligan cycled from Dublin to Wexford carrying James Connolly's battle orders to ensure that the volunteers in the area rose to support those in Dublin. When the volunteers disbanded he cycled back to Cavan but was arrested at the family home.\nHe was elected unopposed as the Sinn F\u00e9in MP for Cavan West at the 1918 general election. The following month, in January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, though Galligan did not attend as he was in prison. He was arrested again in September 1920  and re-elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Cavan constituency at the 1921 elections. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted in favour of it. He did not contest the 1922 general election and retired from politics.", "link_mentions": {}}}
