During this period Ewen was, in his own words, \"a pretty straightforward figurative painter influenced by the Post-Impressionists.\"Paterson Ewen interview by Greg Curnoe, March 18, 1969, cited in Teitelbaum, Paterson Ewen, 99.  This began to change around 1949, when Fran\u00e7oise Sullivan's influence and the Automatiste milieu pushed Ewen towards abstraction. This tension between surface and figurative form can be seen in paintings like Interior, Fort Street, Montr\u00e9al [#1] (1951). Ewen showed very little until 1955, when he began exhibiting abstract works. This new way of painting balanced the psychic automatism of les Automatistes with the rising star of hard-edged geometric Plasticiens like Molinari and Tousignant, both of whom Ewen shared a studio with in the mid-1960s. During this period, Ewen was also influenced by Camilla Gray's work on Russian Constructivism, the monochromes of Paul-\u00c9mile Borduas, and the work of Northwest Coast artistsThis refers broadly to works by Tlingit, Haida, Heiltsuk, Nuxalk, Tsimshian, Kwakwaka'wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth artists, but the ROM's collection has a specific history with Kwakwaka'wakw arts spoliated from Alert Bay in 1921 under the Canadian government's Potlatch ban. on display at the Royal Ontario Museum."]}, {"page": "Nicolete Gray", "response": ["Nicolete Gray (sometimes Nicolette Gray) (20 July 1911\u20138 June 1997) was a British scholar of art and calligraphy.
