Cox had been considering a return to painting in oils since 1836 and in 1839 had taken lessons in oil painting from William James M\u00fcller, to whom he had been introduced by mutual friend George Arthur Fripp. Hostility between the Society of Painters in Water Colours and the Royal Academy made it difficult for an artist to be recognised for work in both watercolour and oil in London, however, and it is likely that Cox would have preferred to explore this new medium in the more supportive environment of his home town. By the early 1840s his income from sales of his watercolours was sufficient to allow him to abandon his work as a drawing master, and in June 1841 he moved with his wife to Greenfield House in Harborne, then a village on Birmingham's south western outskirts. It was this move that would enable the higher levels of freedom and experimentation that were to characterise his later work."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Pocock", "response": ["Pocock married Ann Evans of Bristol in 1780; together they had eight children.

This initially included William James M\u00fcller, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham, John Skinner Prout and Robert Tucker, according to Tucker's own account. The meetings later grew to include more artists, although relatively few surviving drawings have been identified, compared to the meetings of the 1820s, and by the 1830s the works of the Bristol School were less original. Other participants in the meetings probably included Samuel Jackson, Stephen C. Jones, James Baker Pyne, Henry Brittan Willis, W. Williams, Joseph Walter, George Arthur Fripp, Edmund Gustavus M\u00fcller, and William Evans. These sketching meetings may have lasted into the 1840s."]}, {"page": "G. A.
