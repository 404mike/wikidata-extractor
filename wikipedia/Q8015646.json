The Roentgen apparatus was purchased, but no records survive of treatment, and by 1907 the equipment was no longer being used (it was given to the Skin Hospital in 1910). By 1905, Dr Wild had become interested in the therapeutic use of the newly discovered radium and experimented, once more with aid from Professor Schuster, on three patients. Radium was expensive, however, and the management refused to purchase any more until the results of tests from London hospitals were available. By 1914, a leading local doctor, Sir William Milligan, had begun a campaign in the 'Manchester Guardian' to raise funds for radium treatment. Appealing to a mixture of local pride and the contemporary enthusiasm for the curative powers of radium, an appeal was launched, on the advice of Ernest Rutherford, for \u00a325,000. An initial contribution of \u00a32000 from local brewer Edward Holt was not initially much emulated, but following the intervention of the Mayor, a series of 'Radium days' were organized which eventually raised enough money to start a small Radium Institute, initially housed in the Manchester Royal Infirmary. In 1921 it moved to new premises in Nelson Street donated by Sir Edward and Lady Holt, and became the Manchester and District Radium Institute."]}, {"page": "The Grange, Edinburgh", "response": ["* Rev Dr William Milligan (1821\u20131893)"]}, {"page": "1821 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 15 March \u2013 William Milligan, Scottish theologian (died 1893)"]}, {"page": "1893 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 December \u2013 William Milligan, Scottish theologian (born 1821)"]}, {"page": "Kilconquhar", "response": ["*Rev William Milligan was minister of the parish from 1850 to 1860 and his son George Milligan was born here in 1860."]}, {"page": "The Baird Lecture", "response": ["*1885: The Revelation of St John, by Prof William Milligan"]}, {"page": "1893 in Scotland", "response": ["* 11 December \u2013 William Milligan, theologian (born 1821)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Leishman", "response": ["In bad health, Leishman spent the winter of 1876\u20137 in Spain and Egypt, and investigated Mozarabic and Coptic service-books.
