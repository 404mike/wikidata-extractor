In the twenty fifth minute, Clark once again ran with the ball down the left hand side of the pitch, outrunning QPR's Ron Hunt, before crossing it into the path of Jeff Astle. His subsequent shot was saved by QPR goalkeeper Peter Springett, who managed to push the ball around the post. QPR briefly had a chance for a counterattack as Mark Lazarus found himself on the halfway line with the ball, before taking it around Ian Collard and found the Albion defence out of position, leaving him with a clear path to goal. But the opposition players were gaining on him as he approached the penalty area, with the attack falling apart shortly afterwards. Nine minutes before half time, QPR found themselves under attack by Albion again with some cross pitch passing resulting in Clark's second goal of the game. QPR had a corner just before half time which fell to the feet of club captain Mike Keen, but his shot went off the post. The game went into half time at 2\u20130 to Albion.", "| GK ||1 ||\u00a0Peter Springett"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Football League Cup", "response": ["| ||1 ||Peter Springett"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1970s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Peter Springett"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 1997", "response": ["*Peter Springett, 51, English footballer."]}, {"page": "Springett", "response": ["*Peter Springett (1946\u20131997), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham", "response": ["* Peter Springett, former professional goalkeeper, born in Fulham; brother of goalkeeper Ron Springett.", "* Ron Springett, former professional goalkeeper, born in Fulham; brother of goalkeeper Peter Springett."]}, {"page": "Springett, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Springett"]}]}}
