Relatives claimed that she had died of natural causes, whereas her husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazim, believed that she had been murdered in a so-called \"honour killing\"; an autopsy and forensic examination concluded that she had been raped and strangled.Her former husband, Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel, was arrested on suspicion of her murder and while in custody allegedly confessed to drugging and strangling his ex-wife.
