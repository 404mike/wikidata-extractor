Wild had just returned from Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition. To captain Endurance Shackleton had wanted John King Davis, who had commanded Aurora during the Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Davis refused, thinking the enterprise was \"foredoomed\", so the appointment went to Frank Worsley, who claimed to have applied to the expedition after learning of it in a dream.Huntford 1975, pp.\u00a0364\u2013365. Tom Crean, who had been awarded the Albert Medal for saving the life of Lieutenant Edward Evans on the Terra Nova Expedition, took leave from the Royal Navy to sign on as Endurances second officer; another experienced Antarctic hand, Alfred Cheetham, became third officer.Fisher 1957, p.\u00a0310. Two Nimrod veterans were assigned to the Ross Sea party: Mackintosh, who commanded it, and Ernest Joyce. Shackleton had hoped that Aurora would be staffed by a naval crew, and had asked the Admiralty for officers and men, but was turned down.Huntford 1975, pp.\u00a0370\u2013371. After pressing his case, Shackleton was given one officer from the Royal Marines, Captain Thomas Orde-Lees, who was Superintendent of Physical Training at the Marines training depot.Huntford 1975, p.\u00a0372.", "Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness.Huntford 1975, p.\u00a0656. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two\u2014Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham\u2014had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild, Frank's younger brother and member of the Ross Sea party, had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry.Shackleton 1919, pp.\u00a0339\u2013341. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the army rank of major.Fisher 1957, p.\u00a0432. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition on , which left London on 17\u00a0September 1921. From the Endurance crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, Alexander Kerr, Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green all sailed with Quest.Smith 2015, pp.\u00a0402\u2013407."]}, {"page": "Endurance (1912 ship)", "response": ["* Alfred Cheetham, Third Officer"]}, {"page": "Harry McNish", "response": ["When the ship became trapped in pack ice his duties expanded to constructing makeshift housing, and, once it became clear that the ship was doomed, to altering the sledges for the journey over the ice to open water. He built the quarters where the crew took their meals (nicknamed The Ritz) and cubicles where the men could sleep. These were all christened as well; McNish shared The Sailors' Rest with Alfred Cheetham, the Third Officer. Assisted by the crew, he constructed kennels for the dogs on the upper deck. Once Endurance became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for the men. To pass the time in the evening, McNish joined Frank Wild, Tom Crean, James McIlroy, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the wardroom."]}]}}
