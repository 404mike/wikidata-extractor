MBChB is a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees a degree awarded after 5 years of what is analogous to a combined undergraduate-graduate course of study.  Such degrees can be awarded in the U.K. and other countries (such as New Zealand and South Africa). McDonald's doctoral thesis work dealt with experimental neuropathy in cats induced by diphtheria toxin. It was conducted at the Department of Physiology under the supervision of Professor Archie McIntyre. \nHe lectured widely  both in the United Kingdom and abroad. He received, in 1968, a fellowship of the Royal Australian College of Physicians, in 1972 of the London Royal College of Physicians, in 1989 of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in 1989, and in 1999 of the Academy of Medical Sciences.
