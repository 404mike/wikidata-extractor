His film credits include We Make Ships (1988), Channel 4; Tell Them in Gdansk (1989), Channel 4 - \"The end of shipbuilding on the River Wear was announced in December 1988, but many shipyard workers refused to give up the fight. This film centres on a party held for the redundant shop stewards and their families and combines the music of the Flying Pickets and the humour of comedian Mike Elliott to illustrate the ironies of the closure. The title highlights Mrs Thatcher's support for the striking shipyard workers in Gda\u0144sk while shutting down UK yards; Birmingham Is What I Think With (1991), Arts Council England--about the poet Roy Fisher; The Shadow and the Substance (1994), Channel 4. The Shadow and the Substance (the title is a quote from John Clare\u2019s poem on enclosure) examined the nature of work in an increasingly high-tech environment. In the film Rosemary Cramp, Emeritus Professor of Archaeology at Durham, discusses the basic human need and dignity in \"labour\" in prehistoric times as do redundant shipyard workers from Sunderland and Tyneside. This was contrasted with the \"psychic need\" to work as seen by the Adam Smith Institute justifying the paying of slave labour wages. It also featured the Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins, on the morality of the poor stealing food. The Durham Miners\u2019 Gala featured Tony Benn speaking about privatisation eroding morality and citizenship. Young women working at a new Fujitsu semiconductor plant situated in a former mining area are asked if they feel secure in their jobs. This was to be the future, replacing mining and heavy industry. Their manager admits \"humans contaminate the product\". (The factory later closed with a loss of 600 jobs during Tony Blair\u2019s premiership.) The film concludes with a visit to the philosopher Andre Gorz who predicts the collapse of \"work\" and posits a radical alternative for trade unionist and socialists."]}, {"page": "Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland", "response": ["*Rosemary Cramp"]}, {"page": "Robert Smyth Academy", "response": ["* Prof Dame Rosemary Cramp (1940-7), Professor of Archaeology, University of Durham (1971\u201390)"]}, {"page": "Yeavering", "response": ["While there are still some large questions to resolve on matters of chronology, Yeavering offers a number of insights into the nature of early Northumbrian kingship.  It sits within the wider Germanic tradition of a life centred around the hall and its occupants drew upon forms, practices and ideas from the Roman and Frankish worlds.  But at the same time it drew on local, regional traditions for structures and in burial rites. Its importance for the Northumbrian kings was, perhaps, as the traditional place of local assembly and as a cult centre at which deep-rooted, traditional ideologies could be appropriated.  It is not clear why it was abandoned: Bede says that it was replaced by Maelmin.  This site is known from cropmarks at Milfield a few kilometres north-east (Gates and O'Brien 1988). Perhaps, as Rosemary Cramp suggested (1983), as the Northumbrian kings gained in authority they had no need of the traditional assembly and cult site in the hills.", "*Professor Rosemary Cramp (Chairperson)"]}, {"page": "Medeshamstede", "response": ["The most visible remnant of sculptural and architectural activity at Medeshamstede is the sculpture now known as the Hedda Stone, dated by Rosemary Cramp to the late eighth or early ninth century, and kept on show at Peterborough Cathedral.Cramp, R., A century of Anglo-Saxon sculpture, Graham, 1977, p. 192. This date is subject to discussion: see Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland, \"St Margaret, Fletton, Cambridgeshire\". CRSBI. Retrieved 24 May 2008. The attribution to Hedda is a modern, antiquarian development, presumably based on a twelfth-century text known as the \"Relatio Hedd\u00e6 Abbatis\" (\"Story of Abbot Hedda\"): Mellows, 1949, pp. 159\u201361. It is of extremely limited historical value, but was clearly a source used by Hugh Candidus, and is first found in a twelfth-century manuscript created at Peterborough called the \"Liber Niger\" (\"Black Book\": Society of Antiquaries of London, manuscript no.60, see e.g. Willetts, P.J., Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Society of Antiquaries of London , Boydell, Brewer, 2000).
