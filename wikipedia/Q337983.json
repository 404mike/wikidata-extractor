She wrote to her husband in February of that year from Packington Hall, announcing her intention to run off with George Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford. George's brother Lord Randolph Churchill at the same time wrote to involve the Prince, whom he asked to moderate the reactions of Aylesford and Williams. Aylesford, however, sent a telegram to his mother, asking her to collect the children of the marriage; she had no idea of the circumstances, and Alexandra of Denmark, who knew what Edith intended, sent her husband the Prince a cipher telegram again asking him to smooth things over. Matters became embroiled since the Prince took Aylesford's side, while Randolph tried to pressure him over the existence of certain letters. Williams wrote to Charles Yorke, 5th Earl of Hardwicke, who was acting for the Prince in dealing with Randolph, suggesting Aylesford should challenge Blandford to a duel (by then illegal). Aylesford, by then returned from India, met Hardwicke in the House of Lords, and explained that instead he was divorcing Edith."]}, {"page": "Charles Yorke (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Charles Yorke, 5th Earl of Hardwicke (1836\u20131897), British aristocrat, Conservative politician, dandy and bankrupt"]}]}}
