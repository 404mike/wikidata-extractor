After a wicketless debut against Hampshire in May 1920,\nhis next game was against Gloucestershire. He took nine wickets in the match, including what was to remain a career-best 6/48 in the second innings.After 1922 Richardson did not appear at first-class level again until 1926, when he played one match. He also turned out once in 1927 and twice in 1928. After that, he played occasionally at minor level for Gentlemen of Worcestershire, taking six wickets against Bromsgrove School in a single-innings game in 1929.", "link_mentions": {}}}
