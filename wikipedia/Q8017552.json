After a wicketless debut against Hampshire in May 1920,\nhis next game was against Gloucestershire. He took nine wickets in the match, including what was to remain a career-best 6/48 in the second innings.After 1922 Richardson did not appear at first-class level again until 1926, when he played one match. He also turned out once in 1927 and twice in 1928. After that, he played occasionally at minor level for Gentlemen of Worcestershire, taking six wickets against Bromsgrove School in a single-innings game in 1929.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Richardson", "response": ["*William Richardson (1656\u20131727), MP for Armagh and Hillsborough", "*William Richardson (died 1755) (1690\u20131755), MP for Augher", "*William Richardson (1710\u20131758), MP for Armagh", "*William Richardson (1749\u20131822), MP for Armagh", "*Sir William Richardson, 1st Baronet (died 1830), MP for Augher and Ballyshannon", "*Friend Richardson (William Richardson, 1865\u20131943), 25th governor of California", "*William Richardson (Maryland politician) (1735\u20131825), Revolutionary War soldier", "*William Richardson (Mississippi politician) (1951-1997), Mississippi politician and teacher", "*William Richardson (governor) (died 1829), Deputy Governor of Anguilla", "*William Richardson (Cambridge University cricketer) (1861\u20131933), English cricketer with Cambridge University", "*William Richardson (Worcestershire cricketer) (1894\u20131971), English cricketer with Worcestershire", "*William Richardson (Derbyshire cricketer) (born 1938), English cricketer with Derbyshire", "*William Richardson (New South Wales cricketer) (1866\u20131930), Australian cricketer with New South Wales", "*William Richardson (footballer) (1880\u20131903), Australian rules footballer", "*William Richardson (martyr) (1572\u20131603),  beatified Roman Catholic martyr", "*William Richardson (bishop) (1844\u20131915), Anglican Bishop of Zanzibar, 1895\u20131901", "*William Richardson (antiquary) (1698\u20131775), English academic and antiquary", "*William Richardson (classicist) (1743\u20131814), Scottish professor and scholar", "*William Richardson (astronomer) (1796\u20131872), British astronomer", "*William Richardson (songwriter), Tyneside songwriter"]}, {"page": "William Richardson (cricketer, born 1894)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Richardson (Worcestershire cricketer)"]}, {"page": "William Ethelbert Richardson", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Richardson (Worcestershire cricketer) "]}]}}
