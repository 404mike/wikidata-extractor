While completing a marine engineering apprenticeship, he played football as an amateur for Gateshead. In March 1962, he turned professional with Brighton & Hove Albion, about to be relegated to the Football League Third Division. He was initially unpopular because he had displaced captain Roy Jennings from the team, but soon established himself as first-choice centre half and was twice voted Albion's Player of the Season. Over 12 years with the club, he made 440 appearances in the Football League and 488 in all first-team competitions. Albion's long-serving goalkeeper Brian Powney said Gall \"was the best player [he] ever played with because of his consistency over all the years.\""]}, {"page": "Bertie McGonigal", "response": ["McGonigal was born in 1942 in Cookstown, Northern Ireland. He represented his country at schoolboy and youth level, and played for Chimney Corner before signing for Irish League club Glentoran in 1959. Playing part-time and working as a joiner, he made 102 appearances in all competitions, and was Glentoran's goalkeeper as they won the 1960\u201361 Gold Cup. In February 1962, he moved on to Brighton & Hove Albion of the English Second Division, where he was a first-team regular until December 1963 when a serious injury gave Brian Powney his chance. McGonigal acted as backup to Powney after his recovery, but played little, and was released after four years with the club."]}, {"page": "Powney", "response": ["* Brian Powney (born 1944), English footballer "]}]}}
