Justin Welch briefly fulfilled the role, though he only lasted six weeks before joining the Crawley band Spitfire.Harris, p. 36 He did, though, stay long enough to record two songs with the band, which were set to be released as the \"Be My God\"/\"Art\" single on RML Records. The band was dissatisfied with the result, and most of the 500 copies pressed were destroyed.Harris, p. 36-37 Suede placed another advert seeking a replacement. To the band's surprise, it was answered by the Smiths\u2019 former drummer, Mike Joyce. He ultimately turned down the job as he felt Suede still had to forge their own identity. He felt that by being in a band that had similarities to the Smiths, he would have done them more harm than good.Barnett, p. 45 In June 1990, Suede found a permanent drummer, Simon Gilbert, through Ricky Gervais, who would later become a household name for co-writing and starring in the TV series The Office. Both worked at the University of London Union (ULU).
