Marshall was distinguished for research in the field of tumour cell signalling. His track record includes the discovery of the N-Ras oncogene\n, the identification of farnesylation of Ras proteins, and the discovery that Ras signals through the MAPK/ERK pathway. These findings have led to therapeutic development of inhibitors of Ras farnesylation, MEK and B-Raf.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King Henry VIII School, Coventry", "response": ["* Christopher Marshall (doctor), Professor of Cancer Biology, Institute of Cancer Research."]}, {"page": "Christopher Marshall", "response": ["* Christopher Marshall (revolutionary) (1709\u20131797), Irish-born leader in the American Revolution", "* Christopher Marshall (doctor) (1949\u20132015), British cancer biologist", "* Christopher Marshall (composer) (born 1956), New Zealand classical music composer"]}, {"page": "Christopher John Marshall", "response": ["#REDIRECTChristopher Marshall (doctor)"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Christopher Marshall, 66, doctor and cancer researcher."]}, {"page": "Alan Hall", "response": ["In 1981 he went to work at Institute for Cancer Research in London, where he stayed for 12 years. His work, in collaboration with his colleague and close friend Christopher Marshall, made seminal contributions to our understanding of cell signalling in animal cells, in particular the role of Rho and Ras small GTPases in regulating a variety of cellular functions such as proliferation, morphology and migration. In 1982, Hall helped identify transforming sequences in human sarcoma cells lines at the Institute for Cancer Research in London. DNA from a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line and a fibrosarcoma cell line transformed a NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line. After injection into mice, tumors started to form in as little as 10 days. Next, the transforming activities of the rhabdomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines were measured after being digested with an array of endonucleases. Further DNA testing showed that the transforming sequences in the two cancer cell lines were the same, and the gene was later characterised as N-ras, a member of the Ras gene family."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2015", "response": ["*Christopher Marshall, 66, British cancer researcher, colorectal cancer.ICR mourns loss of Research Director Professor Chris Marshall"]}]}}
