A young man (Anthony May) dressed in a fashionable mod style prepares for the day from his rooftop flat and cycles around to the theme song. He then takes his bicycle and descends to the streets of the leafy suburbs.  Cycling down some steps he crashes into the bike of a little girl (Leslie Goddard) and is knocked unconscious.  She stands over him showing her pigtails, glasses and braces and gazes at him, clearly besotted.  The man awakes and asks the girls name. She tells him she is called Kate.  He bids her farewell and cycles off, she follows behind.  As he cycles the man sings a song about how he does not envy the responsible, monotonous lives of older people.  The girl blows a raspberry as she passes a queue of people at the bus stop; this starts a disagreement between the people at the stop which ends with a food fight."]}, {"page": "The Triple Echo", "response": ["* Anthony May as Subaltern"]}, {"page": "McVicar (film)", "response": ["*Anthony May as Billy"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1968", "response": ["|Les Bicyclettes de Belsize||Douglas Hickox ||Judy Huxtable, Anthony May ||Musical ||Short film"]}, {"page": "The Breaking of Bumbo", "response": ["* Anthony May as Art Student"]}, {"page": "Dickens of London", "response": ["*Anthony May as Hullah"]}, {"page": "Ottershaw School", "response": ["*Anthony May"]}, {"page": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1968 TV series)", "response": ["*Anthony May \u2013 Fergus Markham"]}, {"page": "Les Bicyclettes de Belsize (song)", "response": ["\"Les Bicyclettes de Belsize\" (translation: \"The Bicycles of Belsize\")  is a song written and composed by Les Reed and Barry Mason.
