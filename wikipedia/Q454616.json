He was the only son of the Bront\u00eb family, and brother of the writers Charlotte, Emily and Anne. Bront\u00eb was rigorously tutored at home by his father, and earned praise for his poetry and translations from the classics. However, he drifted between jobs, supporting himself by portrait-painting, and gave way to drug and alcohol addiction, apparently worsened by a failed relationship with a married woman. Bront\u00eb died at the age of 31, insisting on standing in his final moments.", "link_mentions": {}}}
