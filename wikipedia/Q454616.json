He was the only son of the Bront\u00eb family, and brother of the writers Charlotte, Emily and Anne. Bront\u00eb was rigorously tutored at home by his father, and earned praise for his poetry and translations from the classics. However, he drifted between jobs, supporting himself by portrait-painting, and gave way to drug and alcohol addiction, apparently worsened by a failed relationship with a married woman. Bront\u00eb died at the age of 31, insisting on standing in his final moments.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Branwell Bront\u00eb (1817\u20131848, E)"]}, {"page": "June 26", "response": ["*1817 \u2013 Branwell Bront\u00eb, English painter and poet (d. 1848)"]}, {"page": "September 24", "response": ["*1848 \u2013 Branwell Bront\u00eb, English painter and poet (b. 1817)"]}, {"page": "1848", "response": ["* September 24 \u2013 Branwell Bront\u00eb, English painter, poet, brother of novelists Charlotte, Emily and Anne (b. 1817)"]}, {"page": "Wuthering Heights", "response": ["* Heathcliff is a foundling from Liverpool, who is taken by Mr Earnshaw to Wuthering Heights, where he is reluctantly cared for by the family, and spoiled by his adopted father. He and Catherine Earnshaw grow close, and their love is the central theme of the first volume. His revenge against the man she chooses to marry and its consequences are the central theme of the second volume. Heathcliff has been considered a Byronic hero, but critics have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points, making his character hard to fit into any single type. He has an ambiguous position in society, and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that \"Heathcliff\" is both his given name and his surname. The character of Heathcliff may have been inspired by Branwell Bront\u00eb. An alcoholic and an opium addict, he would have indeed terrorised Emily and her sister Charlotte during frequent crises of delirium tremens that affected him a few years before his death. Even though Heathcliff has no alcohol or drug problems, the influence of Branwell's character is likely. Hindley Earnshaw, an alcoholic, often seized with madness, also owes something to Branwell.

Presuming that he was familiar with his sisters' novels, du Maurier believed that the story of Helen's marital life with Arthur Huntingdon may have been \"a warning to Branwell\" and the relationship between \"erring, neglectful husband\" and \"the pious, praying wife\" resembles Branwell's views on the marriage of Lydia Robinson, the woman at whose house he was employed as a tutor to her son, while Anne was governess to her daughters.
