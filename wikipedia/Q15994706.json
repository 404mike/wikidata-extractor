His mother was interested in botany and natural history.  He studied at St Cross School, Surrey and then as a boarder to Hereford Cathedral School and Brasenose College, Oxford studying mathematics before switching to zoology. He was a Senior Hulme Scholar and a Christopher Welch Scholar. He began to take an interest in British insects, collecting along with H. A. Hamm. His expertise in entomology was appreciated by teachers like Charles Elton. He worked as a research assistant at the Imperial College in the entomology department in 1927. He became a reader in 1937. It was here that he met Maud Norris, his future wife. He became head of the department of zoology at Imperial College in 1953 and also served as a director of the College Field Station in Silwood Park. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1959. He travelled on collection trips to Guyana with his younger brother Paul W. Richards. He retired in 1967. He also travelled to Brazil and Africa, making collections and studying collections in the US and Australia. In 1978 he published The Social Wasps of the Americas. He also contributed to the field of quantitative life budgets and population estimation.Among his key activities were revisions made along with Richard Gareth Davies to the Textbook of Entomology by Augustus Daniel Imms. He married the entomologist Maud J. Norris in 1931. Richard's mother was devoutly Anglican while his father was Welsh Baptist but as a child he did not attend church and in later life was an agnostic. His collection of insects which included 69000 Hymenoptera and 14000 diptera were donated to the museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hereford Cathedral School", "response": ["*Owain Richards, entomologist and ecologist"]}, {"page": "Augustus Daniel Imms", "response": ["The first edition of his A General Textbook of Entomology appeared in 1925, published by Methuen.

Additionally, it was left out of Yoshikawa's list of Polistes species around the world in 1963. More recently however P. erythrocephalus has been recognized as a separate species by Owain Richards though it is sometimes still referred to as Polistes canadensis erythrocephalus.

Cresson himself does not mention P. carolina, but states that he found P. perplexus very closely resembling P. rubiginosus, also recognised as a species in his time, and perhaps just to be a male form of this taxon. He also described P. generosus as a new species in the same paper, from three specimens from Texas, stating that it \"may be an extreme variety of perplexus\". P. generosus was published on the next page after P. perplexus, which means that when the two taxa were considered synonym, P. perplexus had taxonomic priority because it was published first. Owain Richards saw it as a synonym of P. carolina in 1978, although Wade and Nelson recognised it as a species in a paper published the same year. Thus the taxon was for a long time, and until relatively recently, confused with P. carolina."]}]}}
