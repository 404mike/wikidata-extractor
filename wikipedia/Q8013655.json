Parry was a leading voice in a range of activities and causes, and was the first general secretary of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union.\nBorn in Bethesda to John and Elizabeth, Parry was a religious man who took a keen interest in the plight of the slate and stone quarry workers local to his home town. Parry took a prominent part in the creation of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union in 1874, and as well as taking the role as general secretary, later became the union's president. In 1879 he visited slate mines in the United States on the request of his union.\nIn 1889 Parry became a member of the first Caernarfonshire County Council, and its chairman in 1892\u20131893. In 1896, he led the purchase of the Pantdreiniog quarry in Bethesda and was became the manager.Parry wrote for several local newspapers, in both the Welsh and English language, and published several books. Of note are his works y Ymdrafodaeth (1875) and The Penrhyn Lock-out (1900). Many of his papers and writings are held at Bangor University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bethesda, Gwynedd", "response": ["* William John Parry - first general secretary of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union."]}, {"page": "George Douglas-Pennant, 2nd Baron Penrhyn", "response": ["As an opponent of trade unionism, Lord Penrhyn refused to allow the intervention of outsiders in dealings with his men, and late in 1900 a second general strike began, known as the Great Strike. The quarries were again closed, but were re-opened after a prolonged stoppage with 600 of the former  non-union workmen. Penrhyn refused to re-engage the ringleaders or to recognise any trade union officials. On 9 August 1901, Robert Thomas Jones, raised a discussion as a matter of urgent public importance on the conduct of the local magistrates in requisitioning cavalry for maintaining peace in the district, but Penrhyn's position was unaffected. On 13 March 1903, he brought an action for libel against William John Parry, in respect of an article in the Clarion, accusing him of cruelty to his workmen; he received \u00a3500 damages and costs. Penrhyn acted throughout in accordance with what he believed to be stern equity and from a wish to obtain justice for non-union men. In 1907, he gave his workmen a bonus of 10 per cent on their wages, owing to a spell of bad weather which had interrupted work at the quarries."]}, {"page": "Penrhyn quarry", "response": ["William John Parry, one of the founders of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union, and an alderman in Bethesda, organised a co-operative to take over several other local quarries and employ locked-out Penrhyn quarrymen.

The three-year strike against Penrhyn was the longest industrial dispute in British history, and brought great hardship to the 2,000 quarrymen who were locked out. The operation of Pandreiniog, Moel Faban and Tanybwlch quarries failed to provide a lasting model of co-operation, but they did keep many skilled quarrymen from emigrating to the United States."]}, {"page": "North Wales Quarrymen's Union", "response": [":1874: William John Parry", ":1876: William John Parry", ":1884: William John Parry"]}, {"page": "1927 in Wales", "response": ["*1 September - William John Parry, author and political activist, 84"]}, {"page": "William Parry", "response": ["*William John Parry (1842\u20131927), Welsh businessman, politician and author"]}, {"page": "1840s in Wales", "response": ["**September 28 \u2014 William John Parry, quarrymen's leader (died 1927)"]}, {"page": "1842 in Wales", "response": ["*28 September \u2013 William John Parry, quarrymen's leader (died 1927)"]}, {"page": "Y Werin", "response": ["Y Werin is a weekly Welsh language newspaper, supportive of labour politics, established by Welsh National Press Co. in Caernarfon and which circulated in the counties of Caernarvonshire, Anglesey and Merionethshire.

Alderman William John Parry was determined to help. Parry had been one of the founders of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union in 1874, and was the union's first general secretary. He led a syndicate from South Wales that purchased Pantdreiniog and was appointed manager of the quarry. By October he had taken on 40 workers, announcing his intention to only employ married men in an effort to support the families of the strikers as well as the men. This venture failed, and in March 1900 Parry was forced to put the quarry up for sale. There was no successful bid at the auction, and the quarry company went into liquidation, throwing 106 men out of work."]}]}}
