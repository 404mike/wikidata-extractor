Tysilio travelled through Dyfed and across the Channel to Saint-Suliac where he established a second monastery. Tysilio is traditionally said to be the original author of the Brut Tysilio, a variant of the Welsh chronicle Brut y Brenhinedd,Brynley F.

According to a colophon attached to the chronicle, Walter was responsible for translating the book, which is ascribed to the 7th-century Saint Tysilio, first from Tysilio's Welsh into Latin, and then back again: \"I [\u2026] translated this book from the Welsh into Latin, and in my old age have again translated it from the Latin into Welsh.\"Brut Tysilio, tr. P. Roberts, The Chronicle of the kings of Britain. p. 190. Some antiquarians, notably Flinders Petrie in 1917, suggested that Walter's original Welsh source for the Brut Tysilio was in fact the \"ancient book\" described by Geoffrey.Flinders Petrie, \"Neglected British History\", Proceedings of the British Academy, Volume VIII, pp. 251-278.

Its \"extreme impartiality\" was asserted by H. E. Butler, and denied by Meic Stephens; Brynley F.

Brynley F. Roberts agreed that it has to be used with care, but nevertheless believed it to represent \"Gerald at his disciplined best as a writer\", its brevity being the mark of its discipline and careful construction.  He saw this, together with the interest of the subject matter and the warmth of the author's personality, as being the factors that made the Descriptio Cambriae and the Itinerarium Cambriae the most popular of Gerald's works."]}]}}
