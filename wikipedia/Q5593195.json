He later played for Farsley Cricket Club and coached at Ampleforth College and Woodhouse Grove School, and was head groundsman at the latter when he died, aged 60, in 2006.The cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, remarked, \"Graham Roope was one of those cricketers who thrilled spectators and frustrated selectors. Tall and stylish, there was a touch of class about his middle-order batting. He could make the ball swing at medium pace and his slip fielding was what you would expect from a Corinthian Casuals goalkeeper\". Bateman added \"as a former selector said: 'He looked the part \u2013 but never played it'\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Graham Roope"]}, {"page": "International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981", "response": ["*Brian Close (captain); Ray East; John Edrich; Bruce Francis (Australian); John Gleeson (Australian); Graham Johnson; Peter Lee; Graham Roope; John Snow; Roger Tolchard; Bob Woolmer (a South African, who was born in India and played for England)"]}, {"page": "Chris Old", "response": ["One of his most notable performances was taking four wickets in five balls on the opening day of the Test Match against Pakistan at Edgbaston in June 1978, the wicketless third ball being a no-ball. Bowling at pace from the City End, the second ball of his nineteenth over was top-edged by Wasim Raja to wicket-keeper Bob Taylor before his third ball nipped back through the gate to remove Wasim Bari's off stump. Old's fourth ball, the no-ball, was edged by Iqbal Qasim into the ground but Qasim nicked a late outswinger to the keeper off the next legitimate delivery, before Sikander Bakht found the safe hands of Graham Roope at second slip.  Old thus equalled the record of four wickets in five balls set by Maurice Allom on his Test debut at Lancaster Park, Christchurch in 1929\u201330, a feat which has since been repeated by Pakistan's Wasim Akram."]}, {"page": "Berkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Graham Roope"]}, {"page": "Geoff Cope", "response": ["\"Iqbal Qasim came in, a little left-hander. I chose to go round the wicket and obviously we put men round the bat, 'Brears' (Mike Brearley the captain) at first slip, Graham Roope, Bob Willis, 'Both' all round the bat. I just bowled it right and it was magic really; it just turned a fraction and bounced, and 'Iqqie' nicked it. Brears just dived to his left and caught the ball about a foot off the ground, landed in front of Roopey and Willis, Iqqie just looked up the wicket at me, nodded, said, 'Well bowled'; the umpire went bananas, shaking hands and saying, 'I've never seen a hat-trick before, well bowled.' And ironically this was on my debut. 12 months previously, on the same ground, Peter Petherick of New Zealand had just done the first hat-trick ever on debut, so it would have been 12 months to the day and it would have been a unique place in history.\" \"But Mike in landing got a lot of gravel on the back of his hand. Iqqie left the field and all the lads were up there when suddenly Brears started saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to bring him back because I don't think I caught it cleanly.' All the lads around him were adamant he had caught it a foot off the ground, but he said, 'No, for the best interests of this series I'm going to bring him back.' So he brought him back \u2013 and for the best interests of the series, six of us were lbw in our first innings. It happened, but it was a moment of disappointment because something like that on a Test debut is very special. As somebody once said, 'If bad luck hadn't been invented, we'd have had none at all!'\""]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2006", "response": ["*Graham Roope, 60, British cricketer, heart attack."]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1975", "response": ["Rick McCosker (127, his maiden Test century) and Ian Chappell (192) took Australia to 280/1 at the end of the first day, setting up a total of 532/9. In reply, Barry Wood (30), John Edrich (12 from 98 balls) and David Steele (39 from 106 balls) painstakingly defied the Australians as England reached 78/1, but following the dismissals of Wood and Edrich, Jeff Thomson and Max Walker combined to reduce England to 147/8; only the tail-end efforts of Chris Old (25 not out) and John Snow (30) enabled England to reach an eventual total of 191 all out. Chappell asked England to follow on; with two-and-a-half days of a six-day Test remaining, defeat seemed almost inevitable. Still further resistance from Edrich (96) and Steele (66) saw England close the fourth day on 179/1; after Lillee dismissed both in quick succession the following morning, England continued to resist. Bob Woolmer (149, his maiden Test century) defied Australia for more than eight hours, sharing partnerships of 122 with Graham Roope (77) and 151 with Alan Knott (64) as England held out for 14 hours to reach 522/5. Only a spell of medium pace from Doug Walters eventually conquered England's lower order. In the limited remaining time, Australia reached 40/2. Chappell announced his retirement from the captaincy at the end of the match."]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1977", "response": ["Surrey captain John Edrich won the toss and decided to bat first. Openers Edrich, and Alan Butcher got off to a solid start, taking them to 48 for the first wicket. Their partnership was broken when Butcher was caught behind by Rod Marsh off the bowling of Len Pascoe for 23. Lonsdale Skinner contributed 17, but then Edrich was joined by Pakistan Test batsman Younis Ahmed, and the pair added 66 for the third wicket. Their stand was broken by the medium bowling of Max Walker who had Ahmed caught by Kim Hughes for 40, and dismissed Edrich caught behind for 70 soon after. Walker then dismissed David Smith for a duck, and at 165 for 5 the tourists were in a commanding position. New batsman Graham Roope had other ideas though, and was in commanding form. He formed lower order partnerships with Intikhab Alam (16), Robin Jackman (16), and Geoff Arnold (11) who all supported him ably as he made his way to 107 not out, guiding Surrey to a respectable 327 for 8. Not for the first time in the match, play was abandoned early on the second day due to rain, and no play occurred on the third day, with the match ending in a draw."]}, {"page": "Bradford Premier League", "response": ["* Graham Roope (England)"]}, {"page": "1977 English cricket season", "response": [" || Graham Roope || 31 || 1431 || 115 || 55.03 || 5"]}, {"page": "Indian cricket team in England in 1971", "response": ["The wicket provided little help to spinners and India rested Chandra and Venkataraghavan.
