In the first episode, \"Ghosts and Ghoulies\", the rest of the gang meet Whizz and his little sister Peewee for the first time.

The series had a very similar format to its predecessor, following the adventures of seven children (with very similar personalities to the \"Six and 1/2\" group) who used a double decker bus as their clubhouse.
