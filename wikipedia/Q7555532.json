He first appeared on-screen during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2006. The character was initially portrayed by actor Ben Thompson from his introduction until 8 October 2010, when the character was written out of the serial. Ryan was created by series producer Steve Frost as part of the Connor family. The character was reintroduced in 2012, with the role recast to actor Sol Heras. Heras quit the role in July 2013 and Ryan departed on 2 October 2013. Ryan's return was confirmed in February 2018 and he returned on 23 May 2018, with Ryan Prescott recast in the role.", "In March 2012, Simon Boyle of the Daily Mirror reported that Ryan would be returning to Coronation Street. Boyle said Ryan would return as \"a very dark character\" who has a \"damaging impact\" on the soap's younger residents. The character's return was not confirmed until 17 May 2012. Sol Heras took over the role from Thompson, after he chose not to return to the soap. A writer for itv.com stated that Ryan returns home unexpectedly after he is thrown out of university. Series producer Collinson said \"Ryan returns carrying a dark secret and Michelle is going to have the fight of her life as she battles to get her troubled son back on the straight and narrow. Sol is a brilliant young actor and I'm so excited to welcome him to the cast.\" Asked about his audition Sol Heras said: \"I thought initially that it would be quite a long, drawn-out process, but it all happened quite quickly! I had my first audition with the casting department, and then I heard later that I'd made it onto the longlist of actors that they were considering. After that, I made it onto the shortlist, which to me was an achievement in itself. I then had a screen test with Kym Marsh and Brooke Vincent. Six days later, my agent phoned me to tell me that I'd got the part - so that was one of the best phone calls I've ever had.\"", "In May 2012, it was rumoured that once Ryan would return he would now be a much darker character and would become involved in a drug storyline with Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Kym Marsh who plays Michelle Connor confirmed the storyline in June 2012, Marsh said: \"Ryan's been off doing his own thing, and has got heavily involved in drugs. Michelle expected him to come back as the same kid he was before he went away, but that's not going to happen.\" Asked how difficult this experience will be for Michelle, the actress replied: \"Very hard. Michelle's got her work cut out trying to get Ryan back on the straight and narrow, but we'll see her get support from outside influences.\" Speaking of the storyline Sol Heras said: \"It's a very serious storyline but in the real world it does happen. As long as it's done professionally and done well, it's great. I think it'll be good for young people to see the consequences that come from drugs. You'll see that the drugs are the reason that Ryan is falling out with everyone and causing trouble. There's a loneliness to Ryan because no-one really trusts him. It just shows that it's a bad way to go.\" Speaking of being compared to Ben Thompson (who previously portrayed Ryan) he said: \"Ryan is not the way he was before and he's picked up bad habits, so that's enabled me to come in and essentially be a fresh character, He's changed so much that I didn't have to stick to how the previous actor had played him, which really helps when you're coming into a new show.\""]}, {"page": "Ben Thompson (actor)", "response": ["Thompson auditioned in 2006 for the role of Cameron McIntyre in the long-standing British soap opera Coronation Street.
