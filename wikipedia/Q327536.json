Amid the transfer speculation, Ekstrand made a poor start of the season when he was \"sent\u2013off after just two minutes for a collision with Nathan Redmond\", in a 3\u20130 loss against Norwich City on 16 August 2014. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the first team against Huddersfield Town on 30 August 2014, starting the whole game, in a 4\u20132 win. Since returning from suspension, Ekstrand continued to regain his first team place, playing in the centre\u2013back position for the next thirteen league matches despite facing competitions along the way. However by December, he was dropped from the first team squad by manager Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107, due to his change of formation 3\u20135\u20132 tactics and Football League rules on home-grown player as the reason Ekstrand was dropped from the first team squad. By late\u2013December, he faced his own injury concern that saw him out for a month. After returning to training from injury in February, Ekstrand returned to the starting line\u2013up against Bolton Wanderers on 14 February 2015 and scored his first goal for the club in two years, in a 4\u20133 win. However during a 3\u20132 win against Leeds United on 28 February 2015, he suffered a hamstring injury and was substituted in the 42nd minute, resulting in him missing the next two matches. But Ekstrand returned to the starting line\u2013up against Reading on 14 March 2015 and helped Watford win 4\u20131. However, his return was short\u2013lived when it was announced on 24 March 2015 that he would be out for up to nine months after damaging his cruciate ligament in a Football League Championship match against Ipswich Town three days ago. While on the sidelines, Watford gained promotion to the Premier League. At the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Ekstrand went on to make twenty\u2013five appearances and scoring once in all competitions."]}]}}
