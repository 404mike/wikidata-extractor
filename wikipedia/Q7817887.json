He was the leading participant in efforts to put out the fire which was emitting radioactive contamination into the air, and so played a key role in minimising Britain's worst nuclear disaster.Tuohy was born in Wallsend and educated at St Cuthbert's High School, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Reading University.\nDuring World War II he worked for the Royal Ordnance as a chemist, and in 1946 joined the nuclear industry, becoming deputy general manager of Windscale in 1957.\nOn 10 October 1957 his boss phoned him at home where he was nursing a family sick with flu, saying: \"Come at once. Pile number one is on fire.\" Leaving his wife and two children, he told them to stay indoors and keep all the windows closed. At the factory he discarded his radiation recording badge, so that no one could tell him that he had exceeded permitted radiation dose limits, and made repeated inspections directly into the 80 ft pile. Over the next few hours he was instrumental in directing the efforts which eventually brought the blaze under control. The pile structure survives to this day, too radioactive for decommissioning to be completed until 2037.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Windscale fire", "response": ["Those who had been directly involved in the events were heartened by Penney's conclusion that the steps taken had been \"prompt and efficient\" and had \"displayed considerable devotion to duty\". Some considered that the determination and courage shown by Thomas Tuohy, and the critical role he played in the aversion of complete disaster, had not been properly recognised. Tuohy died on 12 March 2008, having never received any kind of public recognition for his decisive actions. "]}]}}
