In its mildest form, purism stipulates the use of native terms instead of loanwords. In stronger forms, new words are coined from Germanic roots (such as wordstock for vocabulary) or revived from older stages of English (such as shrithe for proceed). Noted purists of Early Modern English include John Cheke, Thomas Wilson, Ralph Lever, Richard Rowlands, and Nathaniel Fairfax. Modern linguistic purists include William Barnes, Charles Dickens, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Elias Molee, Percy Grainger, and George Orwell."]}, {"page": "Blackerby Fairfax", "response": ["Blackerby Fairfax was the son of Nathaniel Fairfax.

It was popular, however, and is supposed to have influenced Robert Plot's compilation of a Natural History of Oxfordshire. Childrey explicitly recommended a plain style, as Plot did. The work has also been suggested as an influence on Carl Linnaeus when he was writing on Swedish provinces."]}]}}
