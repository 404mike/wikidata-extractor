O'Hora decided to split to take a teaching job in late 2005. Grant then jumped from keyboards to lead vocals and bass as Phil Lanzon returned on keyboards for a tour of Russia and Germany in October/November. New singer Mark Thompson Smith (ex-Praying Mantis) joined in November 2005 for some Swedish gigs, while Jo Burt (ex-Black Sabbath) was temporary bass player. Tony Mills (ex-Shy) was slated to be Sweet's new singer in early 2006 but failed to work out and left after six shows in Denmark. At this point, O'Hora came back as fill in front man and then Grant did another turn himself as the singer/bassist (Steve Mann depped on keyboards) until the group finally landed a new permanent front man when Peter Lincoln (ex-Sailor) arrived in July 2006.

In August 2013 Tony Mills announced that he had decided to leave TNT to pursue solo projects, stating, \"For most of this year we have barely played [live] and have not written or recorded anything new.

I've decided that it's best if he carries out as planned, and then the band and I can sit down and discuss if we're going to do anything in the future - with enough time to do it right.\" On 17 October 2013 Harnell confirmed that he had rejoined TNT, stating, \"I'm very proud of all we accomplished over the years and proud to have written and recorded all those great songs with my brother from another mother, Ronni Le Tekr\u00f8.
