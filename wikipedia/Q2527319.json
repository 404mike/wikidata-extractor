He appears to have ruled part of the territory that had previously been held by Commius, the Gaulish former ally of Julius Caesar who fled to Britain following the uprising of Vercingetorix, or possibly of his son. Eppillus is not mentioned in any historical sources. Coins bearing his name also bear the inscription COMMI.FILI which is generally read as Commios filius indicating at least a claim to be Commius's son.After Commius's death in about 20 BC, based on numismatic evidence, Eppillus seems to have ruled jointly with another ruler named Tincomarus. The COMMI.FILI inscription also appears on Tincomarus's coins suggesting they could have been brothers. Eppillus's capital was Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester) in the south of the kingdom, while Tincomarus ruled from Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) in the north.\nEppillus became ruler of the whole territory a little before 7 AD, and Tincomarus appears as a supplicant to the Emperor Augustus in his Res Gestae, so he would seem to have been driven out in some sort of domestic intrigue. After this, Eppillus's coins are marked \"Rex\", indicating that he was recognised as king by Rome.\nA single stater has been found in Dover bearing the name of Eppillus and an otherwise unknown Anarevito. The relationship between the two is unclear although it has been suggested that they were allied rulers.\nIn about 15 AD, Eppillus was succeeded as king of the Atrebates by Verica. Verica again issues coins with the COMMI.FILI inscription suggesting perhaps a third brother although Verica's possible presence in Rome in 47 AD would have required Commius to have lived a very long life.  At about the same time, coins of the Cantiaci stamped with the name Eppillus start to appear in Kent, replacing those of Dubnovellaunus. It is possible that Eppillus was deposed by Verica, fled to Kent and established himself as king there, but equally possible that he was invited to become king by the Cantiaci, peacefully handing the rule of the Atrebates to Verica, or that he died and was succeeded by Verica, and that Eppillus of Kent was another man of the same name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denarius", "response": ["In the final years of the 1st century BC Tincomarus, a local ruler in southern Britain, started issuing coins that appear to have been made from melted down denarii.

After that, Tincomarus ruled the northern part of the kingdom from Calleva, while Eppillus ruled the southern half from Noviomagus (Chichester).

These coins were inscribed COMMIOS and appear to have been issued by the son of the Commius mentioned by Julius Caesar in his writings, although it is possible that the first of these coins was issued by the original Commius. The only coins with the COMMIOS inscription are gold staters, but quarter starters and silver coins have been linked to the series. The COMMIOS Gold staters contained about 47% gold and weighed between 5.3g and 5.5g.  After Commius two series of coins appear to have been issued by Tincommius and another by Eppillus.", "Eppillus appears to have held land in two areas and issued a different series of coins in each of them. In particular the gold coins Eppillus had circulated in the area around Calleva Atrebatum were thicker than those circulated in Eppillus's holdings in northern Kent and the silver coins heavier. The style of the coins suggests a different die cutter in  each region with a few cases of each cutter producing a die for the other region. The coins issued around Calleva Atrebatum represent something of a break from previous styles although some of them appear to have derived design elements from the coins of Tincommius as well as various Roman denari. A single stater has been found in Dover baring the name of Eppillus and an otherwise unknown Anarevito. A small number of coins have been found in kent that appear to have been jointly minted by Eppillus, Tincommius and a third leader named Verica. The style of these coins is similar to those circulated in Eppillus's holdings in northern Kent with elements similar enough to suggest a common die cutter.", "Eppillus and Tincommius appear to have had their holdings taken over by Verica who from around AD 10 issued gold staters and quarter staters based on those of Tincommius and Eppillus. Differences in style between coins suggests that Verica was operating two mints one using an engraver formerly employed by  Eppillus and the other derived from Tincommius. Verica's stater series weighed between 5.27g and 5.29g while the gold content varied between 42% and 44.5% The gold content appears to have remained stable over time with no sign of debasement. Verica also issued silver coins striking both units and minims. As with his staters these made heavy use of Roman motifs.  In the AD 30s Epaticcus issued staters along with silver units and minims in an area around Silchester. British coin striking in the area came to an end with the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* Eppillus (fl. c. 20BC\u2014AD7), Iron Age king with capital at Chichester"]}]}}
