At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives. Meanwhile, Henry Drummond, Member of Parliament for the West Surrey constituency which covered the Brookwood site, James Mangles, MP for the nearby constituency of Guildford, and labour reform campaigner Lord Ashley (later Lord Shaftesbury) lobbied against the proposal. Drummond considered the scheme a front for land speculation, believing that the promoters only intended to use  for the cemetery and to develop the remaining 80% for building; Mangles felt that the people of Woking were not being fairly compensated for the loss of their historic rights to use the common lands; Ashley felt that the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 had been a victory for the campaign to end private profiteering from death and that the new scheme would reverse these gains, and was also concerned about the health implications of diseased bodies being transported to and stored at the London terminus in large numbers while awaiting trains to Brookwood."]}, {"page": "Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\"| James ManglesFor political affiliation see Stoke next Guildford pp57-8, 1999 edition, author Lyn Clark, publisher Phillimore."]}, {"page": "James Mangles", "response": ["James Mangles may refer to:", "*James Mangles (MP) (1762\u20131838), English merchant and politician", "*James Mangles (Royal Navy officer) (1786\u20131867), explorer and botanist"]}, {"page": "Mangles", "response": ["*James Mangles (MP) (1762\u20131838), English merchant and politician", "*James Mangles (Royal Navy officer) (1786\u20131867), FRS, explorer and botanist"]}, {"page": "Ross Donnelly Mangles", "response": ["He was the son of James Mangles of Guildford and his wife Mary, and was educated at Eton College and East India College, Haileybury.
