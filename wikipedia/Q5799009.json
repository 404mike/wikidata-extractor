The band's original line-up consisted of completely different members compared to that of the band's line-up from 2008 and released their debut EP, Tomorrow. Hope. Goodbye. In 2006, then followed up with their debut album titled The Irony of Your Perfection in 2007. After realizing he would not be able to achieve international success in Dubai, he moved back to England, Nottingham in 2008 and reassembled the band with new members from the local area, including lead singer Danny Worsnop, whom he had moved into his flat apartment in York.", "In 2012 the band was listed by Revolver under the most anticipated albums of 2012, with Danny Worsnop giving the statement that the general sound of the album will be a \"...musical baby of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Slipknot.\" In March the band participated in Dallas' 'South By So What?!' festival and later toured with support acts Trivium, Dir En Grey, I See Stars, Motionless In White and the Amity Affliction throughout North America from early March to early April, naming the tour 'Still Reckless'.", "Towards the end of their Outbreak tour, Danny Worsnop sustained a torn vocal cord, causing him to sit out the New York performance and allow the singers of Atilla and I See Stars, along with a multi-talented roadie to perform vocal duties. Despite the injury the singer later performed at the memorial concert for Suicide Silence's Mitch Lucker in order to raise money for his now fatherless daughter.", "On 22 January 2015, lead singer Danny Worsnop announced his departure from the band to focus on rock music with his new band We Are Harlot. He also stated that despite his departure, the band would continue touring. Lead guitarist Ben Bruce announced that there would be a new lead singer. Fans reacted to news in distress as they believe he was essential to the band's sound, while others were not surprised by his career move, some going as far to say he performs better with his new band We Are Harlot than he does with Asking Alexandria. When Bruce was queried regarding his status with Worsnop he stated that he felt abandoned long before his departure since Worsnop's lost the care for screaming and heavier music since their release of their second album, and continued to say that he would not know if he could call him and Worsnop friends.", "In mid-October 2016, it was speculated that the band had settled their differences with original lead vocalist Danny Worsnop and that some sort of collaborative effort would be made after several pictures were posted of Worsnop and Bruce in the studio together. However, it was revealed two days later that Worsnop had actually returned to the band as an official member after the departure of Denis Stoff. Ben Bruce explained that after a long period of time of not communicating with the band, Stoff stated, \"Asking Alexandria does not exist unless I get what\u2019s owed to me\". Worsnop also opened up about his return to the band, stating that \"this is something that [he] can embrace again\". When the band performed again for the first time with Worsnop since Stoff's departure, their set list excluded all songs from their most recent album The Black and instead consisted of songs that they had not performed in years. This occurred just as the band headlined Sumerian's \"Ten Years in the Black Tour\" supported by Veil of Maya, Born of Osiris, I See Stars, Upon a Burning Body, After the Burial, and Bad Omens. As time went on more information regarding Stoff had been released, such as that Stoff had lip-synced the band's older songs during live performances, an accusation made by Worsnop's lawyers who notified him after sending Stoff a cease and desist. When asked about Stoff's time as his replacement, Worsnop replied stating that \"Replace is a strong word. He was just keeping my seat warm. Honestly, I don\u2019t know the kid so I have no opinion of him as a person\u2026\" Stoff stated that his departure was due to personal stress caused by the unrest in his home country of Ukraine.", "Ben Bruce has expressed the feeling that the band's lyrical style before Reckless & Relentless was immature. According to Bruce, the band wanted to move on from yelling out lyrics like \"fuck\" and \"you stupid fucking whore\" to a more mature style with more meaning. He stated that From Death to Destiny is lyrically their most mature album, no longer focusing on subjects such as drugs and women, and much more meaningful than their older lyrics. Danny Worsnop has claimed that the band's lyrics are never written before entering the studio and are always improvised during the recording of an album.", "Asking Alexandria - Rock am Ring 2018-4441.jpg|Singer Danny Worsnop", "* Danny Worsnop \u2013 lead vocals ; additional guitar ; keyboards, programming "]}, {"page": "Stand Up and Scream", "response": ["* Danny Worsnop \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, programming "]}, {"page": "Sumerian Records", "response": ["* Danny Worsnop (on Better Noise Music)"]}, {"page": "Reckless & Relentless", "response": ["During an interview with Fallen Blue, Danny Worsnop said of the album cover, \"We wanted something shocking, so we had the famous porn actress, Belladonna, just sitting in The Dirty Room.\" Danny further discussed, \"Someone, Somewhere\", a song off the new album as the first one \"that I wrote the lyrics using my emotions as a backdrop.\"", "* Danny Worsnop \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, programming"]}, {"page": "Life Gone Wild", "response": ["* Danny Worsnop \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, programming"]}, {"page": "List of cover versions of Michael Jackson songs", "response": ["|Danny Worsnop||\"Man in the Mirror\"||2013||Thriller: A Metal Tribute to Michael Jackson"]}, {"page": "Trust in Few", "response": ["The band announced that Tyler Smith of The Word Alive and Danny Worsnop of Asking Alexandria would be featured on one track each.
