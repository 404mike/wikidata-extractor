In 1833 he helped to found the non-denominational Manchester Domestic Home Mission, and he acted as its secretary for many years. Inspired by a visit from Boston minister Joseph Tuckerman, the mission gave practical assistance such as food and blankets to the poor. He was also active in the District Provident Society, an organisation founded by James Kay and William Langton with similar pragmatic aims. Gaskell supported public health measures and housing reform, sitting on the committee of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, as well as another committee formed to regulate beer halls in the area."]}, {"page": "Manchester Statistical Society", "response": ["The founders of the Society included three men who had key roles in the Manchester and Salford District Provident Society, also founded in 1833: the secretaries, James Phillips Kay (later Sir James Phillips Kay-Shuttleworth), a doctor, and William Langton, a banker; together with the treasurer, Benjamin Heywood, also a banker.Cullen, pp. 104-105, Selleck, 1994, p. 80 The Provident Society used house-to-house visits to collect information about the needy in Manchester in order to provide support.Bevis, p. 74 Another involved in the Statistical Society at the outset was cotton spinner John Kennedy, who had been present at the meeting at which the Statistics Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was initiated.O\u2019Brien, 2011, p. 52 "]}, {"page": "Joseph Gouge Greenwood", "response": ["He was twice married: first, to Eliza, the daughter of John Taylor, a Unitarian minister in Manchester.
