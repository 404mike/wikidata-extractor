Her first career break came in 2006 when she replaced an indisposed Pamela Armstrong as Fiordiligi in Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte at the New York City Opera. She returned to the NYCO the following year in a much lauded portrayal of Elvira in Don Giovanni. She also received positive reviews in 2007 for her performance of Fiora in L'amore dei tre re with the Opera Orchestra of New York at Carnegie Hall and for her portrayal of Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi's Il trovatore at the Caramoor International Music Festival."]}]}}
