He began his career with Manchester United, but failed to break into the first team and after loan spells at Bradford City, Doncaster Rovers, Oldham Athletic, Coventry City and Ipswich Town, he joined Watford in 2013. At the end of the 2013\u201314 season, he spent a month on loan to Carlisle United, before leaving Watford for Barnsley on a free transfer ahead of the 2014\u201315 season. He lasted just a season there before joining Bury. He joined Sheffield United for the 2016\u201317 season, but was released in January 2017 and returned to Bury. At the end of the season, he joined Rochdale, but his time there lasted just one season. His elder brother, Wes, also played for Manchester United from 1998 to 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 1", "response": ["*1991 \u2013 Reece Brown, English footballer"]}, {"page": "David Flitcroft", "response": ["Flitcroft strengthened for the 2015\u201316 League One campaign by signing strikers Leon Clarke and Tom Pope, midfielders Jacob Mellis and Danny Pugh, as well as defenders Peter Clarke and Reece Brown. Bury went ten league games unbeaten in September and part of October. Bury ended the season in 16th-place. In preparation for the 2016\u201317 campaign, Flitcroft released six players and brought in a number of new signings, including: Antony Kay, Greg Leigh, Leon Barnett, Neil Danns, Paul Rachubka, Chris Brown and James Vaughan. Flitcroft was named as League One Manager of the Month for September 2016 after overseeing five wins from five games that the League Managers Association described as \"guided by Flitcroft\u2019s beliefs in attacking play and some shrewd moves at the end of the transfer window\". On 16 November, Flitcroft was sacked after a run of 11 games without a win that coincided with a series of injuries to first-team players such as Tom Pope, Danny Mayor and Nathan Cameron. Gareth Southgate's promotion to England manager left a vacancy for the head coach role of the under-21 team and Flitcroft applied for the position, making into the final four of the interview process, though the job instead went to Aidy Boothroyd."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Reece Brown||||2010||3||0||"]}, {"page": "Joshua King (footballer)", "response": ["Having returned to England, King joined Hull City on loan for the rest of the 2011\u201312 season on 16 January 2012.
