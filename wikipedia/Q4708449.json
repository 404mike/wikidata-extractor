He has made contributions to the field of logic, especially non-classical logic.  One of his ideas is proving the undecidability of the relevance logic R. He also published papers in theoretical computer science venues, mostly on mathematical logic topics of relevance to computer science.\nA native of Scotland, Urquhart received his MA in Philosophy from the University of Edinburgh in 1967, and his PhD from the University of Pittsburgh in 1973 under the supervision of Alan Ross Anderson and Nuel Belnap.

The details of this implicit typing are spelled out in [Zermelo 1930], and again in a well-known article of George Boolos [Boolos 1971].\""]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Alasdair Urquhart"]}, {"page": "Relevance logic", "response": ["Operational models for negation-free fragments of relevance logics were developed by Alasdair Urquhart in his PhD thesis and in subsequent work. The intuitive idea behind the operational models is that points in a model are pieces of information, and combining information supporting a conditional with the information supporting its antecedent yields some information that supports the consequent. Since the operational models do not generally interpret negation, this section will consider only languages with a conditional, conjunction, and disjunction.", "* Alasdair Urquhart.
