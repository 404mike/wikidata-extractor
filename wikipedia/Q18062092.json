He now resides in Gothenburg, Sweden where we works as an artist.Enfant Bastard was a prominent member of Edinburgh's alternative music scene of the 2000s alongside artists such as Meursault and Withered Hand. His work has been critically acclaimed in the Scottish music press, and he has been described by The Scotsman as 'Edinburgh's most beguiling musical innovator' and as a 'lo-fi genius' by The Skinny. He was also important in introducing Chip Music to Scotland.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Withered Hand", "response": ["Willson began his solo musical career at age 30, after one of his close friends died and his wife bought him a guitar for his 30th birthday. As Withered Hand, the first song he wrote was Cornflake. Willson studied at Art College in London, and moved to Edinburgh with his then-girlfriend, to whom he is now married, in 1996. Shortly thereafter, Willson tried his hand at being a visual artist, but eventually abandoned his work in the field. He attributes this in part to his \"lack of success in expressing myself visually.\" He was guitarist in Edinburgh band Barrichello, which he joined in 1999. This band broke up amicably in 2002. His second band was known as Squits, and later became a short-lived art rock group named Peanut. He was also a member of the short lived anti-folk group The Love Gestures alongside Cammy Watt of Enfant Bastard and Neil Pennycook of Meursault."]}]}}
