He was actually born in London and baptised there two days after his parents married there. After returning to his father's native island, he followed his father's trade in lithography but abandoned it later in life. He also learned the art of painting, without any formal training. About 1832 he returned to London and practiced as water-colour painter. His technique gave his paintings a particularly misty and foggy effect. After Queen Victoria's visit to Jersey in 1846, a volume of drawings by Le Capelain of scenery of the island was presented to her as an official souvenir by the States of Jersey. This led to his receiving a commission from the Queen to paint pictures of the Isle of Wight. While engaged on these he developed tuberculosis, of which he died in Jersey in 1848.\nA view of Mont Orgueil by Le Capelain was used on the reverse of the 1976 Jersey \u00a320 banknote.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Culture of Jersey", "response": ["John Le Capelain (1812\u20131848) was the son of Samuel Le Capelain, a printer and lithographer, and Elizabeth Anne Pinckney, his English wife. Le Capelain displayed early talent, but never had formal art training. He was born and lived all his life in St. Helier, setting up his studio in the attic of his parents' house in Hill Street. He is best known for his watercolours, although he had earlier followed his father in lithography but abandoned it after 1843. He travelled widely, taking advantage of St. Helier's excellent maritime links, and went sketching in France, England and Scotland. He was commissioned to produce a series of watercolours which were presented to Queen Victoria by the States of Jersey to commemorate her visit of 1846. The series was subsequently lithographed and published in book form. The Queen commissioned Le Capelain to produce a series of watercolour views of the Isle of Wight and it was while working on this commission that Le Capelain contracted tuberculosis and died, barely a week after his 36th birthday. A collection of his works, presented by public subscription in his memory, is displayed in the Parish Hall of St. Helier."]}, {"page": "Jean Le Capelain", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Le Capelain"]}, {"page": "List of people from Jersey", "response": ["*John Le Capelain, painter (1812\u20131848)"]}]}}
