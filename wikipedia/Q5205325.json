In the band's 2001 self-titled debut album, her singing voice was originally provided by Cibo Matto singer Miho Hatori, and her speaking voice was originally provided by actress Haruka Kuroda, who performed as a backing vocalist for Gorillaz' 2001 tour. Hatori was suggested as the singing voice of Noodle by producer Dan the Automator, who had previously worked with her for a track by Handsome Boy Modeling School. Her vocals for \"19-2000\" were sometimes provided by Humanz collaborator Kilo Kish (from the track \"Out of Body\") when the song was performed on the Humanz Tour. Noodle is depicted as the lead vocalist for the Demon Days single \"Dare\", in which the vocals were actually provided by R&B singer Roses Gabor (aka Rosie Wilson). In 2016, Gabor re-recorded her vocals for \"Dare\" for a version of the song called \"Dare (Hold it Down)\" recorded by English artist DJ Friction, which was approved by Albarn. Gabor has since performed with Gorillaz as a backup vocalist on the Humanz single \"Andromeda\". Since 2018, Noodle's speaking voice has been provided by Japanese-English actress Haruka Abe. In the Gorillaz era of the band, Noodle had little knowledge of the English language and spoke exclusively in Japanese until the Demon Days era of Gorillaz. When she first started speaking English, she spoke the language with a rather distinctive Japanese accent that has gradually lessened as she got older, with her accent sounding more British as an adult. Noodle regularly switches back and forth between English and Japanese in conversation, speaking in a regional dialect called Osaka-ben in her native tongue. As a child, Noodle's speaking voice was louder and higher pitched, but has since softened and mildly lowered as an adult."]}, {"page": "Friction (disambiguation)", "response": ["* DJ Friction (Germany), a German hip hop DJ and producer", "* DJ Friction (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Autumn Rowe", "response": ["Autumn Rowe (born May 25, 1981), is an American singer-songwriter, TV personality, DJ and activist from South Bronx, New York, United States.
