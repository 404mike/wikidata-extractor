John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, \"Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.\" Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacillating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel. Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased. Bart Ehrman argues that the Gospel of Mark, the earliest one, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 19:16). He connects this change to increased \"anti-Judaism.\" Raymond E. Brown argued that the Gospels' portray of Pilate cannot be considered historical, since Pilate is always described in other sources (The Jewish War and Antiquities of the Jews of Josephus and Embassy to Gaius of Philo) as a cruel and obstinate man. Brown also rejects the historicity of Pilate washing his hands and of the blood curse, arguing that these narratives, which only appear in the Gospel of Matthew, reflect later contrasts between the Jews and Jewish Christians."]}, {"page": "Historical Jesus", "response": ["The prophet of social change portrait positions Jesus primarily as someone who challenged the traditional social structures of his time. Gerd Theissen sees three main elements to the activities of Jesus as he effected social change: his positioning as the Son of man, the core group of disciples that followed him, and his localized supporters as he journeyed through Galilee and Judea. Richard A. Horsley goes further and presents Jesus as a more radical reformer who initiated a grassroots movement. David Kaylor's ideas are close to those of Horsely, but have a more religious focus and base the actions of Jesus on covenant theology and his desire for justice. Elisabeth Fiorenza has presented a feminist perspective which sees Jesus as a social reformer whose actions such as the acceptance of women followers resulted in the liberation of some women of his time. For S. G. F. Brandon, Jesus was a political revolutionary who challenged the existing socio-political structures of his time.Brandon, S.G.F.

After doing National Service in the British Education Corps \u2013 this was at the time of the Korean War \u2013 he presented himself as a student at the Hartley Victoria College in Manchester, as a candidate for the Methodist ministry. Later, however, he chose the path of scholarship and so was not ordained. At the University of Manchester he achieved a B.A. (Theol.) and an M.A. degree in the History of Religions, studying under Professor S. G. F. Brandon. In 1958 he went to Sweden, where seven years later he received his doctorate in theology (Teol. Dr) in Church History with Missiology from the University of Uppsala, Sweden. He married Birgitta Johannesson in 1962. After a one-year visiting appointment at a liberal arts college in Indiana, USA, he joined Prof. Brandon at the University of Manchester, England, in 1966 and then Prof. Ninian Smart at the University of Lancaster in 1970. He collaborated with Ninian Smart in promoting religious studies as a subject in British schools.

Yet he begins without finesse: \"If it be proper for three to be one, that implies that it is certainly possible for three to be nine... .\" He questions how a son could be equal to the father; then he discusses the trinity and the crucifixion. After a theodicean analysis similar to his about Adam and Eve (see the Judaic section above), Mardan-Farrukh observes that \"the sacred being himself created the executioners of his son,\" and concludes that these enemies then slew \"the Messiah, who is the son, through the will of the father.\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 233-236 (SGV XV: 46-76, 46, 49, 51, 64, 76). The author's interpretation here resembles aspects of the Christian heresy fostered by the 2nd century gnostic Marcion.\"According to Marcion, Christianity is essentially a Gospel of Love, not of Law. ... Marcion rejected the Old Testament, which he saw as revelation of a cruel Demiurge, wholly different from the God of Jesus. ... [Marcion] attributed the Crucifixion to the God of the Old Testament.\" Marcion's teaching were firmly rejected. S. G. F. Brandon, editor, Dictionary of Comparative Religion (New York: Scribners 1970) at 427. \"By end of 3rd century most Marcionite communities were absorbed into Manichaeism.\" Manichees originated in the Persian Sasanid Empire.Geo Widengren at 11, comments that Marcion \"grew up in a strongly Iranianized atmosphere.\" From a Zoroastrian perspective one can see a dualism inherent in some of Marcion's doctrines about Christianity.For further indication of Marcion's teachings in Mardan-Farrukh's book, cf. E. W. West (SBE 24) at 242-243 (SGV XV: 152-154), where at his conclusion Mardan-Farrukh makes the claim that the Messiah dissipated the laws of Moses. Mardan-Farrukh's analysis of free will in Christianity likewise (absent Ahriman) results in his ascribing to God responsibility for sins committed by humankind.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 236 (SGV XV: 77-83). Next he discusses St. Paul (P\u00e2var\u00f4s), quoting him thus, \"Not the good works which I desire, but the iniquity which I do not desire, I do. And it is not I that do so, but that which is collected within me does it, because I always see that it is striving with me day and night.\" Mardan-Farrukh may well have associated St. Paul's feeling of an iniquity \"within me\" to Ahriman, for in the first half of the Shkand-Gumanik Vichar he states (as a proof of the existence of metaphysical evil), \"[A] knowledge of the existence of an opponent of the creatures [i.e., Ahriman] is obtainable from the innermost recesses of the body of man... \" which may be observed.E. W. West (SBE 24): St. Paul at 237 (SGV XV: 91, 93-96). For the Christian text per Mardan-Farrukh's quotation of St. Paul, West footnotes Romans vii, 19, 20, 23.

Cyrus himself is hailed... as a messiah, that is, as one who acted in Yahweh's name and with his authority.\" She cites Isaiah 41:1,4. Boyce writes of the \"influence which Zoroastrianism was to exert so powerfully on post-Exilic Judaism.\" She later (at 77) lists Zoroastrian doctrines which Judaism shares.R. C. Zaehner, DTZ (1961) at 20-21, and at 57-58 (\"Influence on Judaism\"). \"That Judaism was deeply influenced by Zoroastrianism during and after the Babylonian captivity can scarcely be questioned.\" Ibid. at 51. a Jewish response to the Zoroastrian faith may be seen in the Book of Job, which was written during or following a period of fruitful interaction between the Jews and the Zoroastrian Persians.\"Job, Book of\" at 376, in Dictionary of Comparative Religion (New York: Charles Scribners' Sons 1970), edited by S. G. F. Brandon. The Judaic version, the Biblical Book of Job, is said to have been written between the 5th and 2nd centuries B.C.E., thus written after their return to Judea from their Babylonian captivity in Mesopotamia. This return was allowed the Jews following their liberation by the Persian Cyrus the Great (c.600-530), whom the Bible calls anointed of God (Isaiah 45: 1-3). The Book of Job preceded the SGV by a millennium.James Hope Moulton at 286-331, presents a chapter on \"Zarathushtra and Israel\", followed by an Appendix on \"The Magian Material of Tobit\" (at 332-340); he references the Book of Job twice. First (at 290), in his \"comparison in detail\" he leads by stating similarities between the Wise Lord and Yahweh, citing Job chapter 28, wherein \"God said to men, 'To be wise, you must have reverence for the Lord. To understand, you must turn from evil'.\" Later (at 305) he compares Ahriman to Satan in the Book of Job.R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 56, states: \"Man suffers at the hands of Ahriman but at least he has the comfort of knowing he is not being tormented by an all-powerful Being who is his own creator. The Zoroastrian does not know the predicament of Job.\" In the Book of Job, the Biblical God allows Satan to severely punish Job, even though Job has done no wrong to merit the abuse. The tragedy of innocent suffering is discussed without resolution by Job and by several friends who blame Job unjustly. Finally, an epiphany of ecstasy is visited on Job by the merciful Deity, in which Job comes to hear God and to realize with awe the Mystery, that God's ways are beyond the reckoning of humankind.Book of Job, 1: 1-5 (Job's good fortune); 1: 6-12 (Satan's interview with God); 1: 13-19 (death of Job's children and destruction of his many flocks); 1: 20-22 (Job's steadfast faith); 2: 1-6 (Satan's second interview with God); 2: 7-8 (Job's loathsome illness); 2: 9-13 (mocked by wife and friends); 3 (Job curses day he was born); 4-31 (fault-finding speeches by four friends and self-justifying answers by Job); 32-37 (speeches by Elihu, e.g., God's greatness); 38-41 (from the whirlwind God speaks to Job); 40: 3-5 and 42: 1-6 (Job's response to God); 42: 7-9 (God rebukes the four friends); 42: 10-17 (God restores Job's good fortune). God to Job: \"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.\" (38: 4) \"Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?\" (40: 2) \"Who then is he that can stand before me? Who has given to me, that I should repay him?\" (41: 10-11) Job's response: \"I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.\" (42: 3) \"Therefore, I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\" (42: 6)Cf., Carl Jung, Antwort auf Hiob (Z\u00fcrich 1952), translated as Answer to Job (Princeton University: Bollingen 1954; reprint Cleveland: Meridian 1960), e.g., in section I at \u00b6568 (p.8/p.30), where an argument found in the SGV is posed, without attribution. Jung writes:\"Yahweh, however, could get inordinately excited about man as a species or men as individuals if they did not behave as he desired or expected, without ever considering that in his omnipotence he could easily have created something better than these 'bad earthenware pots'.\""]}, {"page": "Taboo (book)", "response": ["Reviewers, from a variety of critical perspectives, are unanimous in noting that Steiner\u2019s premature death was a loss to scholarship given the erudite trenchancy of his analytical acumen. Norman Snaith remarked that it was a tragedy \u2018that he died before his own thinking reached a constructive stage.\u2019 For S. G. F. Brandon, \u2018(p)erhaps the fairest estimate of this book is to regard it as prolegomena to a great study of taboo which will, unhappily, not now be written by Franz Steiner\u2019. Assessments of his style however vary. For Fred Cottrell, it was \u2018very lucid and witty\u2019. For Katherine Luomela, the book was  \u2018highly organized, closely reasoned, and tightly written\u2019, though his \u2018sentences are really so jammed with content as to make for rather slow and heavy going (reading) and often raise doubt as to one\u2019s comprehension of his meaning\u2019. S.G. F. Brandon, noting Evans-Pritchard\u2019s remark on the way Steiner\u2019s omnivorous erudition and fanatical search for comprehensiveness slowed the publication of his research, thought it \u2018not an easy book to read, partly owing to that obscurity of expression which so often marks the writing of a scholar in a language of which he has an apparent command but which is not his native tongue.\u2019 But it was precisely the compactness of his thought which endowed the work with peculiar value, for \u2018in its analysis it is most thorough and no tacit assumption nor loose logic in argument is allowed to pass unexamined\u2019. Joseph Politella, to the contrary, regarded the work as a \u2018brilliant exposition, along historical and sociological lines, of the custom of taboo\u2019. In Norman Snaith\u2019s judgement, a proper appreciation of the book could not ignore the tragedy of Steiner\u2019s personal life, as a victim of Nazi tyranny. In this sense, his criticisms of both Robertson Smith and Frazer as thinkers whose ideas were thoroughly embedded in the values of the period they themselves lived and worked in may be applied as a criterion, mutatis mutandis, to Steiner\u2019s own work. \u2018A naturally acute and critical mind has been sharpened to a razor-edge by his privations. This is why his criticisms are so severe, and occasionally super-punctilious. Cora DuBois characterized Steiner\u2019s  \u2018critical reasoning\u2019 as \u2018subtle and involuted, at times to the point of obscurity, and the critical mood is predominantly captious\u2019, but affirmed that, \u2018(n)evertheless, these lectures are of a high intellectual order and occasionally possess passages of literary merit\u2019."]}, {"page": "Samuel Brandon", "response": ["*S.
