Her focus was on medieval Welsh literature, and she taught Celtic Languages and Literature in the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Cambridge, from 1945 to 1976. Among her most important contributions to the study of Welsh literature is Trioedd Ynys Prydein, her edition of the Welsh Triads.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Excalibur", "response": ["The name Excalibur ultimately derives from the Welsh Caledfwlch (and Breton Kaledvoulc'h, Middle Cornish Calesvol), which is a compound of  \"hard\" and  \"breach, cleft\". Caledfwlch appears in several early Welsh works, including the prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 11-12th century). The name was later used in Welsh adaptations of foreign material such as the Bruts (chronicles), which were based on Geoffrey of Monmouth. It is often considered to be related to the phonetically similar Caladbolg, a sword borne by several figures from Irish mythology, although a borrowing of Caledfwlch from Irish Caladbolg has been considered unlikely by Rachel Bromwich and D. Simon Evans. They suggest instead that both names \"may have similarly arisen at a very early date as generic names for a sword\". This sword then became exclusively the property of Arthur in the British tradition."]}, {"page": "Wales", "response": [" The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, and as the father of the Welsh Nation.

She has two sons by Lliaws son of Nwyfre, Gwenwynwyn and Gwanar, who both accompany Caswallawn in his pursuit of Julius Caesar after he has been chased from Britain. This triad is the only source connecting Arianrhod to Beli Mawr and the Caswallawn saga, but it is not incompatible with the tradition recorded in the Mabinogion.

The narrator of the poem is possibly intended to be Taliesin himself. One line can be interpreted as implying that he received his gift of poetry or speech from a magic cauldron, as Taliesin does in other texts, and Taliesin's name is connected to a similar story in another work.Higley, note to Preiddeu Annwn, Stanza II, line 13. The speaker relates how he journeyed with Arthur and three boatloads of men into Annwfn, but only seven returned. Annwfn is apparently referred to by several names, including \"Mound Fortress,\" \"Four-Peaked Fortress,\" and \"Glass Fortress\", though it is possible the poet intended these to be distinct places.

Some have suggested that the name may derive from , or \"Gwenhwy the Great\", as a contrast to , or \"Gwenhwy the less\". Gwenhwyfach (also spelled Gwenhwyach) appears in Welsh literature as a sister of Gwenhwyfar, but Welsh scholars Melville Richards and Rachel Bromwich both dismiss this etymology (with Richards suggesting that Gwenhwyfach was a back-formation derived from an incorrect interpretation of Gwenwhy-far as Gwenhwy-fawr).Richards, Melville, \"Arthurian Onomastics\", in: Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, vol. 2, 1969, p. 257.

The meaning of mei is uncertain. It has been suggested that it refers to the month of May (Mai in Modern Welsh), rendering \"Hawk of May\", although Rachel Bromwich considers this unlikely. Kenneth Jackson suggests the name evolved from an early Common Brittonic name *Ualcos Magesos, meaning \"Hawk of the Plain\". Not all scholars accept the gwalch derivation. John Koch suggests the name could be derived from a Brythonic original *Wolcos Magesos, \"Wolf/Errant Warrior of the Plain.\"Koch, \"The Celtic Lands,\" p. 267. "]}, {"page": "Lancelot", "response": ["Lancelot may have been the hero of a folk tale that was originally independent but was ultimately absorbed into the Arthurian tradition. The theft of an infant by a water fairy, the appearance of the hero at a tournament on three consecutive days in three different disguises, and the rescue of a queen or princess from an Otherworld prison are all features of a well-known and widespread tale, variants of which are found in numerous examples collected by Theodore Hersart de la Villemarqu\u00e9 in his Barzaz Breiz, by Emmanuel Cosquin in his Contes Lorrains, and by John Francis Campbell in his Tales of the West Highlands. As for his name, \"Lancelot\" may be a variant of the common name \"Lancelin\" (as proposed by Gaston Paris in 1881, later supported by Rachel Bromwich).Goulven P\u00e9ron, \"La l\u00e9gende de Lancelot du Lac en Anjou\". Les Cahiers du Baugeois, n\u00b092 (March 2012), pp. 55\u201363, . It is also possibly derived from the Old French word L'Ancelot, meaning \"Servant\" (the hypothesis first put forward by de la Villemarqu\u00e9 in 1842); Lancelot's name is actually written this way in several manuscripts. It is also reminiscent of the uncommon Saxon name Wlanc, meaning \"The Proud One\"."]}, {"page": "Ida of Bernicia", "response": ["Some 18th- and 19th-century commentators, beginning with Lewis Morris, associated Ida with the figure of Welsh tradition known as Fflamddwyn (\"Flame-bearer\"). This Fflamddwyn was evidently an Anglo-Saxon leader opposed by Urien Rheged and his children, particularly his son Owain, who slew him.Bromwich, p. 353. However, Rachel Bromwich notes that such an identification has little to back it; other writers, such as Thomas Stephens and William Forbes Skene, identify Fflamddwyn instead with Ida's son Theodric, noting the passages in the genealogies discussing Theodric's battles with Urien and his sons."]}, {"page": "Percival", "response": ["Scholars disagree as to the exact relationship between Peredur and Percival. Arthur Groos and Norris J. Lacy argue that it is most likely that the use of the name Peredur in Peredur son of Efrawg \"represent[s] an attempt to adapt the name [Perceval] to Welsh onomastic traditions\", as the Welsh romance appears to depend on Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, at least partially, as a source, and as the name Peredur is attested for unrelated characters in Historia Regum Britanniae and Roman de Brut. Rachel Bromwich, however, regards the name Perceval as a loose French approximation of the Welsh name Peredur. Roger Sherman Loomis attempted to derive both Perceval and Peredur from the Welsh Pryderi, a mythological figure in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, a derivation that Groos and Lacy find \"now seems even less likely\"."]}, {"page": "Wild man", "response": ["* Rachel Bromwich (2006).

As he does throughout the work, Geoffrey alters his source material, recasting Gildas' reproved kings as successors, rather than contemporaries as in De Excidio.Wright, p. 10. In addition to Gildas, Geoffrey evidently knew the Dumnonian genealogy essentially as it appears in Geraint and Enid and similar sources. He further adds a number of other details not found in earlier sources, identifying Constantine as a son of Cador, a Cornish ruler known in Welsh tradition as Cadwy mab Geraint. Notably, Geoffrey's Constantine is King Arthur's kinsman and succeeds him as King of the Britons.Bromwich, p. 319. Norris J. Lacy and Geoffrey Ashe suggest Geoffrey made this Arthurian connection based on an existing tradition locating Arthur's birthplace in southwest Britain.Lacy, Ashe, and Mancoff, p. 301. However, noting that the earliest references place Arthur in northern Britain rather than the southwest, Rachel Bromwich considers the connection an arbitrary invention by Geoffrey, perhaps suggested by his earlier inventions of familial ties between Arthur and Constantine the Great and the usurper Constantine III.Bromwich, p. 319, 358. Geoffrey calls Constantine Arthur's cognatus, or blood relative, but does not specify the exact relation, causing much confusion for later writers.Moll, p. 166."]}, {"page": "Conan Meriadoc", "response": ["There is evidence that Conan Meriadoc figured into the Brittonic prophetic tradition as a messianic saviour who would return to lead his people in a time of need. A Cynan appears in several prophetic poems, most notably the Armes Prydein, where he is named alongside Cadwaladr as a figure whose return is promised. Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose knowledge of this tradition is evinced in both the Historia Regum Britanniae and the Vita Merlini, specifically identified this Cynan with Conan Meriadoc. Rachel Bromwich suggests that Geoffrey was relying on an older tradition identifying the founder of Brittany with the prophetic Cynan, and argues that this identification is made already in Armes Prydein. At the time Armes Prydein was composed, the Breton nobility under Alan II, Duke of Brittany had forged an alliance with \u00c6thelstan, king of England, in the face of Viking attacks on their territory. Hywel Dda, then ruler of most of Wales, had also formed a similar relationship with \u00c6thelstan at that time. In spite of this, the poet repeatedly refers to the men of Llydaw (Brittany) as part of his prophesied pan-Celtic union which will oust the English from Britain for good. Bromwich reads the line \"A chymot Cynan gan y gilyd\" (\"there will be concord between Cynan and his fellow\") as a reference to the reunion of the Bretons and their leader Conan Meriadoc with their fellow Britons."]}, {"page": "Caledonian Forest", "response": ["In the Matter of Britain, the forest is the site of one of King Arthur's Twelve Battles, according to the Historia Brittonum, in which the battle is called Cat Coit Celidon.
