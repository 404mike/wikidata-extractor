Rowse, Raymond Sontag, Andreas Hillgruber and Yehuda Bauer. Rowse, who had once been a close friend of Taylor's, attacked him with an intensity and vehemence that was second only to Trevor-Roper's. In addition, several historians wrote books on the origins of the Second World War with the aim of refuting Taylor's thesis. Taylor was angered by some of the criticism, especially the implication that he had set out to exonerate Hitler, writing that \"to the best of my recollection, those who now display indignation against me were not active [against appeasement] on the public platform\".Burk 2002, p. 292 Some notable examples include Gerhard Weinberg's two-volume The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany and Andreas Hillgruber's Deutschlands Rolle in der Vorgeschichte der beiden Weltkriege [Germany's Role in the Background to Both World Wars], translated as Germany and the Two World Wars."]}, {"page": "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich", "response": ["Elizabeth Wiskemann concluded in a review that the book was \"not sufficiently scholarly nor sufficiently well written to satisfy more academic demands...

Sally Marks claimed in 2013 that for \"nearly forty years, historians of twentieth-century diplomacy have argued that the Versailles treaty was more reasonable than its reputation suggests and that it did not of itself cause the Depression, the rise of Hitler, or World War II\". Marks also claimed that Keynes' book was a \"brilliant but warped polemic\" that is \"long discredited by scholars\" and which Keynes regretted writing.According to Elizabeth Wiskemann: \"On the morning after the German \u201celection\u201d [the Reichstag election of 29 March 1936] I travelled to Basle; it was an exquisite liberation to reach Switzerland. It must have been only a little later that I met Maynard Keynes at some gathering in London. \u201cI do wish you had not written that book\u201d, I found myself saying (meaning The Economic Consequences, which the Germans never ceased to quote) and then longed for the ground to swallow me up.

The historian Elizabeth Wiskemann wrote a letter to The Times Literary Supplement, quoting the many favourable reviews of Taylor's book in neo-Nazi publications. The German historian Golo Mann savaged the book in his review, claiming that Taylor attempted to prove Hitler's innocence and that Taylor was not concerned with historical truth but only in demonstrating the sophistication of his own mind. The German conservative historian Gerhard Ritter was also critical. When Taylor flew to Munich for a televised debate with a Swiss historian, the taxi driver who drove him from the airport asked him whether he knew an Englishman called A.J.P. Taylor. Taylor replied that he was A.J.P. Taylor. The driver stopped mid-traffic, told Taylor he had been part of Hitler's SS bodyguard and put out his hand to congratulate Taylor on proving that Hitler had not caused the war.Sisman, p. 296."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Meta Wiskemann", "response": ["#redirect Elizabeth Wiskemann"]}, {"page": "Wiskemann, Elizabeth", "response": ["#redirectElizabeth Wiskemann"]}]}}
