He was educated at Eton and went on to serve with the Coldstream Guards, rising to the rank of captain and fighting in the Battle of Balaclava, the Battle of Inkerman (where he was severely wounded) and the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War.\nOn his return from the Crimea, Holmesdale was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for West Kent at the 1859 general election.
