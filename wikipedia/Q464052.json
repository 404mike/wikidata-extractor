In 1983, at age 16, she began appearing as a topless model on Page 3 of British tabloid newspaper The Sun, and continued as a Page 3 girl until 1986. During this time, Fox became the most popular pin-up girl of her era, as well as one of the most photographed British women of the 1980s.\nIn 1986, she launched a pop music career with her debut single \"Touch Me (I Want Your Body)\", which peaked at number one in 17 countries, and became the first of her three top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Fox also had three songs reach the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"Touch Me (I Want Your Body)\", \"Naughty Girls (Need Love Too)\" and \"I Wanna Have Some Fun\".\nIn 1988, Fox received a Brit Award nomination for Best British Female Artist.

There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos.\" Barry Walters of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and Samantha Fox. Walters also said that \"while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', is pure spam.\" A NME reviewer rated ...Baby One More Time 1 out of 10, saying that \"we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career\".
