Pro-suffrage acting organizations such as The Actresses' Franchise League and Edith Craig's Pioneer Players formed alongside more political entities like the National Society for Women's Suffrage to campaign for the vote using drama and lectures. Only actresses were permitted to join the Actresses Franchise League. However, the AFL vowed to \"assist all other [women's suffrage] Leagues wherever possible\" by creating and performing \"propaganda plays\" and hosting informative lectures on the subject. The United Kingdom was home to many of the premiere suffragist playwrights, including Cicely Hamilton (author of Diana of Dobson'sCockin, Katharine.

Davies became the Liverpool WPSU Branch organiser from June 1910 to September 1912, trying to move the approach of the four branches in the area to holding more large indoor events and social functions, away from the frequent street meetings outside factories and smaller 'At Homes' in more affluent areas that were a feature before her. The groups in the Cheshire side of the Mersey continued the street events with speakers from Liverpool and beyond, and from November 1910 WSPU had toned down its militancy for a period. The branch shop did not do well during that time with a drop from over \u00a318 annual profit from written material sales to just over19shillings (less than \u00a31)  as it became a more exclusive 'members meeting' place. As most of the suffragette literature had been sold at street meetings to spread the message about 'votes for women' to the public, the change in management may reflect lost opportunities to increase support for the cause. Davies organised Holiday Campaigns' in the Lake District, and used Vida Goldstein and Beatrice Harraden, from the national movement to support this. In 1911, Davies was writing to encourage local members to join a deputation to London to attempt to speak to Prime Minister Lloyd-George on 21 November."]}, {"page": "M\u00e4rta Lindqvist", "response": ["In 1914, Lindqvist began her career as a literary translator, producing translations of English, Danish and Norwegian language works into Swedish.
