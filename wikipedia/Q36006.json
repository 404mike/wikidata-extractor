After turning pro in 1979, he quickly rose to the top of the game, winning the World Professional Darts Championship in 1982, then again in 1989. Wilson competed in all major darts tournaments of the era and won the British Professional Championship a record four times between 1981 and 1988.\nA contemporary and rival of Eric Bristow, Bob Anderson and John Lowe, Wilson's ungainly appearance and rough-hewn lifestyle belied his prowess in the sport. He was dogged by health problems, however, and suddenly retired from the game in December 1995. He withdrew from public life, and was rarely seen in public or gave interviews before his death in March 2012.\nIn 2022 the new World Seniors Darts Championships was launched with the trophy engraved with the names of former World Champions Jocky Wilson, Eric Bristow, Leighton Rees and Andy Fordham on the darts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Jocky Wilson (1950\u20132012), world professional darts champion in 1982 and 1989"]}, {"page": "Fife", "response": ["* Jocky Wilson, darts player"]}, {"page": "Dexys Midnight Runners", "response": ["Released right after the live appearance, Dexys' follow-up single, \"Come On Eileen\" (cowritten by Rowland and Paterson with Billy Adams), became that much-needed hit \u2013 a Number One hit in the UK, which also became Dexys' first single released in the United States (and second in North America, after \"Seven Days Too Long\", which was only released in Canada) \u2013 where it peaked at #1 in April 1983 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
