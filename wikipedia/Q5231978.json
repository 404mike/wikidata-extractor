He was a left-handed batsman who scored a Century, on the day his son (Ben) was born, and very occasionally bowled right-arm medium pace. He was appointed Yorkshire's captain at the start of the 1996 season, following the resignation of Martyn Moxon. In 2001, he led the county to their first County Championship title win for 33 years, sealing the championship with a catch taken at North Marine Road.\nIn 1995, Byas was on the verge of an England call-up, having been the first player to reach 1,000 runs in that season, only the return to fitness of Michael Atherton and Graeme Hick, prevented him from doing so. In total he scored 1,913 runs in the whole campaign.\nHis highest score of 213, was made at his home ground of North Marine Road, being one of only five players to achieve a double-hundred in the first-class game, at this stadium.\nByas started his career in 1978, as a second-team player at Scarborough. However, he ultimately helped the club to the latter two of their five ECB National Club Cricket Championship titles (1981 and 1982) at Lord's. In 1984, he set a record in the now former Yorkshire League, by scoring 1,349 runs for the season, a record which stood for 19 years.\nSince retiring, Byas has been a manager and coach at Scarborough, in charge of cricket development at Pocklington School, a senior cricket advisor at Yorkshire, and runs his own cricket school, the 'Byas Academy'.\nIn November 2021, it came to light that Byas had been named in the witness statement of Azeem Rafiq for the employment tribunal  regarding racism he faced at Yorkshire County Cricket Club. It was alleged that Byas regularly used racist language such as the n-word and p-word. Byas has denied these allegations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The team that had been so successful in the 1990s began to break up at the start of the 2000s. Since winning their last trophy in 1998, the team has lost eight semi-finals and two finals. In 2008 Lancashire managed to finish second in the County Championship. The competition was divided into two divisions for the 2000 season, with Lancashire in the first division. Lancashire's one day form began to fluctuate in 2000, losing to Gloucestershire in the semi-finals of both the B&H Cup and the NatWest Trophy, and being relegated in the National League. In 2001, Lancashire avoided relegation by just 5 points and were not promoted in the National League. The end of the season saw the retirement of Ian Austin from first-class cricket and of Mike Atherton from all forms of cricket. John Crawley left the club in the winter after not being retained as captain. Between 2001 and 2002 saw the squad change significantly, with players recruited from Essex, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Yorkshire; the most notable additions to the squad were Stuart Law and David Byas\u00a0\u2013 the Yorkshire captain of the previous season. After a quiet 2001 season\u00a0\u2013 finishing mid-table in the county championship and again failing to secure promotion in the National League\u00a0\u2013 2002 was far more encouraging. Mike Watkinson was appointed cricket manager, and Stuart Law and Alec Swann both scored over 1,000 first-class runs and Peter Martin and Glen Chapple both took more than 50\u00a0wickets; the find of the season was that of James Anderson, who burst onto the scene with 50\u00a0wickets in the second half of the season, earning him a promotion to the England side.
