After an elementary education he initially worked as a farm labourer. He subsequently moved to the Rhondda Valley, where he worked as a coalminer for ten years. From an early age he was involved in the local co-operative society and became a union official organising shop-assistants throughout South Wales. This led to his moving to Manchester, to take up a post with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and later the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers.He was a member of Manchester City Council for thirty years, and also president of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council and of the Withington Divisional Parliamentary Labour Party.In 1921, William Wilson, Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Westhoughton, died, and Davies was elected at a by-election to succeed him.  He served in the first Labour Government in 1924 as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. This was the only government office he held.\nHe retained the Westhoughton seat through successive elections until he retired from the House of Commons early in 1951 due to ill health. At the time he was the longest-serving Labour MP.\nDavies was a strong supporter of the temperance and pacifist movements, whose causes he advocated in Parliament and in the country. He was also a committed parliamentarian, and served as joint secretary of the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.He married Margaret Griffiths in 1902, and they had three sons. Davies died at his home in Porthcawl, Glamorgan, in 1954, aged 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Independent Labour Party", "response": ["Of these eight policies, the living wage, the unemployment allowance, nationalisation of banking and the bulk purchase of raw materials and foodstuffs were the chief concern of the ILP. Increasing the unemployment allowance and switching to bulk purchasing were to be done in the conventional way, but the method of paying the living wage differed from Labour practices. The ILP criticised the \"Continental\" method of paying wage allowances from employers' pools, which had been implemented in 1924 by Rhys Davies. The ILP proposed to redistribute the national income, meeting the cost of the allowances by taxing high income earners."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department", "response": ["*January 1924: Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "First MacDonald ministry", "response": ["| Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "Wilfrid Roberts", "response": ["This year saw open discontent with Winston Churchill's leadership, involving some Conservatives.
