Worcestershire has been classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963 and as a top-level Twenty20 team since the inauguration of the Twenty20 Cup in 2003.The details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Worcestershire player and then his name is given as it would appear on modern match scorecards. Note that many players represented other top-class teams besides Worcestershire and that some played for the club in minor counties cricket before 1899. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only.", "link_mentions": []}}
