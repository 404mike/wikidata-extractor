Dias was born in Amsterdam to \nJacob Vaz Dias and Hana Hamburger. She had a brother, Salomon. She\nmoved to the United Kingdom, where she spent most of her career.Her cinematic credits include performances in the films of major British directors, including Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (1938) and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942). She also appeared in Ernest Morris' The Tell-Tale Heart (1960).\nAuthor Jean Rhys credited Dias with reawakening her literary inclinations. Rhys had disappeared from public view and fallen into obscurity shortly after her novel Good Morning, Midnight was published, in 1939. When Dias adapted the novel for theatrical presentation in 1949, Rhys said that Dias had \"lifted the numb hopeless feeling that stopped me writing for so long\". In 1957, Dias's radio adaptation of Good Morning, Midnight was broadcast by the BBC.She played Solange in the two British premi\u00e8res (the first, given in French, the second, in English) of Jean Genet's The Maids, both of which were directed by Peter Zadek, in 1952 and 1956 respectively. She also played the lead role, Irma (a brothel madam), in the world premi\u00e8re of Genet's The Balcony, which opened on 22 April 1957, in a production directed by Zadek at the Arts Theatre Club, a \"private theatre club\" that enabled the production to circumvent the Lord Chamberlain's ban on public performances of the play.Dias died in London on 30 August 1977. She was survived by her husband, the journalist Hans Werner Egli, with whom she had a son and daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jean Rhys", "response": ["After a long absence from the public eye, she was rediscovered by Selma Vaz Dias, who in 1949, placed an advertisement in the New Statesman asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel Good Morning, Midnight for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel Wide Sargasso Sea. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in Jane Eyre. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable WH Smith Literary Award in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr. Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in Jane Eyre. Diana Athill of Andr\u00e9 Deutsch gambled on publishing Wide Sargasso Sea. She and the writer Francis Wyndham helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, Quartet, Penguin: 2000,  There have been film, operatic and radio adaptations of the book.Brian Kellow,\"On the Beat: A novel that sings: Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea\", Opera News, December 2012 \u2014 Vol. 77, No. 6.\"Jean Rhys \u2013 Wide Sargasso Sea\", RadioListings.\"Jean Rhys \u2013 Wide Sargasso Sea\", BBC Radio 4 Extra.
