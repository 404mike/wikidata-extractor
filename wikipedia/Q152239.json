Despite being entitled to be known as the Princess of Wales, she uses the title Duchess of Cornwall.\nCamilla was raised in East Sussex and South Kensington in England, and was educated in England, Switzerland, and France. In 1973, she married British Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles, with whom she has two children. They divorced in 1995. Camilla was periodically romantically involved with Charles both before and during each of their first marriages. Their relationship became highly publicised in the media and attracted worldwide scrutiny. In 2005, Camilla married Charles in the Windsor Guildhall, which was followed by a televised Anglican blessing at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.\nAs the Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla carries out public engagements, often alongside her husband. She is also a patron, president, or a member of numerous charities and organisations. Since 1994, Camilla has campaigned to raise awareness of osteoporosis, which has earned her several honours and awards. She has also raised awareness of issues such as rape, sexual abuse, literacy, animal welfare, and poverty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 17", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall"]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["* July 17 \u2013 Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, member of the British royal family, second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales"]}, {"page": "1900", "response": ["* May 24 \u2013 Sonia Rosemary Keppel, British baroness, grandmother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (d. 1986)"]}, {"page": "Budapest", "response": ["File:Charles and Camilla in Doh\u00e1ny Street Synagogue.jpg|Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles and Chief Rabbi R\u00f3bert Fr\u00f6lich in the Doh\u00e1ny Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe"]}, {"page": "Prince of Wales", "response": ["The title of Princess of Wales has always been held by the Prince's wife in her capacity as spouse of the heir apparent and therefore future queen consort.

Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation.Duff, p. 111, and Philip Magnus, quoted in Battiscombe, pp. 109\u2013110. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift.Battiscombe, p. 110. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever.Hough, pp. 132\u2013134. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry, Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, humanitarian Agnes Keyser, and society matron (and great-grandmother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall) Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit her husband as he lay dying.Battiscombe, p. 271, and Priestley, p. 18, 180.
