He was therefore unusual in becoming a Bishop of London not from an ecclesiastical, aristocratic or landowning background. His brother was Edward Valentine Blomfield, a classical scholar."]}, {"page": "Edmund Henry Barker", "response": ["Barker was a prolific writer on classical and other subjects, but it is as a lexicographer that he is now mainly known. While at Hatton, he planned a new edition of Stephanus's Thesaurus Graecae Linguae. The work was undertaken by Abraham John Valpy, and, although not publicly stated, it was understood that Barker was the responsible editor. When a few parts had appeared, it was criticized in the Quarterly Review (xxii., 1820) by Edward Valentine Blomfield; the original plan of the work was then curtailed, and Barker's name was not used. It was completed in twelve volumes (1816\u20131828). The strictures of the Quarterly were answered by Barker in his Aristarchus Anti-Blomfieldianus, answered by James Henry Monk."]}, {"page": "Blomfield", "response": ["*Edward Valentine Blomfield, classical scholar"]}, {"page": "King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds", "response": ["*Edward Valentine Blomfield \u2013 classicist"]}, {"page": "Edward Valentine (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward Valentine Blomfield (1788\u20131816), classical scholar"]}, {"page": "Edward Blomfield", "response": ["#Redirect Edward Valentine Blomfield"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Edward Valentine Blomfield \u2013 classicist"]}]}}
