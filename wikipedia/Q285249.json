The only significant challenge came from Plaid Cymru at the 1970 and February 1974 General Elections but this performance has not since been repeated.

In 1993 the MP Ann Clwyd described Tyne Tees as having been \"stripped of any meaningful identity since its take over by Yorkshire TV\" and Ian Ritchie, Managing Director at Tyne Tees, left the company over a widely publicised disagreement with the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees board over what he saw as an unacceptable drive to centralise the company, including the complete closure of all non-news operations at Newcastle and a proposal to close the City Road studios. In October 1993, Yorkshire TV's founder Ward Thomas was brought in to stabilise the situation at the company and quickly returned the company to profitability.Martin Waller. \"YORKSHIRE'S NEW BROOM TURNS GLOOM INTO BOOM\".
