J. Keith, Aspects of John Cowper Powys's Owen Glendower (London: The Powys Society, 2008), p. 20. but then, in subsequent years, he generally referred to it as a historical novel, and it was so sub-titled when it was published.W. J. Keith, Aspects of John Cowper Powys's Owen Glendower, pp. 20-21 This description of the novel is supported by a scholarly introduction, or \"Argument\", giving historical background both to Glendower and to the period, which indicates, Powys had thoroughly researched his subject.See \"Argument\" to Owen Glendower (1941), pp. vii-xx (It came at the end of the British edition of 1942), and Morine Krissdottir, Descents of Memory, p. 330. Indeed the novel reveals that \"Powys was no amateur in the academic world\"C. A. Coates, John Cowper Powys in Search of a Landscape (Totowa, NJ: Barnes and Noble, 1982), p.137.Herbert Davies comments, in John Cowper Powys (Brigend: Seren,1997). p. 125: \"The Argument he appends to the novel shows an awesome grasp of the historical context\". Glen Cavaliero, John Cowper Powys: Novelist (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1973), p. 107: \"The whole background of fifteenth-century Wales is presented with unobtrusive artistry\". But Welshman Roland Mathias, is highly critical of Powys's handling of Welsh history, arguing that he \"chooses to ignore the heart and spirit of early fifteenth-century Wales in favour of a deep-rooted theory of his own\".\"John Cowper Powys and 'Wales': A limited study\". Powys Review 17 (1985), p. 22.But another Welshman, Meirion Pennar, has a more favourable opinion. \"In Search of the Real Glendower\", Powys Review, 18 (1986), pp. 20-23. See also Jeremy Hooker's sensitive response to Mathias, \"John Cowper Powys: Figure of the Marches\", in Imagining Wales (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2001), pp. 95-6.", "In fact Powys's preferred genre was the romance,Glen Cavaliero, John Cowper Powys: Novelist, p.10. though Morine Krissdottir maintains that Owen Glendower \"unlike the other novels, is not a 'romance' but a 'history' \",Quoted by W. J. Keith, p. 20, from Morine Krissdottir's \"Introduction\" to Owen Glendower (2002). and Glen Cavaliero argues that \"the normal definitions of romance hardly serve to define\" Powys's novels, which \"call into question our normal usage of the word 'novel' \".John Cowper Powys: Novelist, p. 10. Jeremy Hooker, however, describes both Owen and Porius as  \" 'Welsh Romances' \" and relates this to Powys \"drawing on a tradition of storytelling far older than that of any 'historical novelist'\" and suggests that \"[i]n a way, he is close to the medieval Arthurian romances\".\"John Cowper Powys: Figure of the Marches\", in Imagining Wales (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2001), p. 105. Hooker also emphasises the influence of the Welsh mythological classic The Mabinogion on this novel, stating \"that the mythology is more essential, more integral, to this romance than its historical circumstances are\".\"John Cowper Powys: Figure of the Marches\", p. 106. W. J. Keith also emphasizes the importance of The Mabinogion, pp.40-8. Another view, while accepting that Owen is a historical novel, sees it as \"a marvellous blend of historicity and vision, of mythology and romance\".Denis Lane, \"The Circuitous Outward: Natural Mythology in Powys's Owen Glendower \". Powys Notes, vol. 11, no.1, Spring 1997, p. 4.", "While Powys's starting point in this novel is the historical facts about Owen Glendower and the early fifteenth century, found in the works of historians such as J. E. Lloyd and J. H. Wylie, he also draws on legend, especially those relating to the mysterious disappearance of Glendower, and the idea that he was a magician.\"Argument\" to Owen Glendower (1941), p. ix and Keith, pp. 51-3.W. J. Keith notes that \"[J. H.] Wylie records, among the 'many marvellous stories that got around about Owen', one that claimed he possessed a 'magical stone' by which 'he could render himself invisible at will' (I, 286)\" (Keith, p. 51). In addition Powys makes use of literature, including the poetry of Iolo Goch, Shakespeare's Henry IV (Part I), and Lady Charlotte Guest's The Mabinogion, a collection of eleven prose stories collated from medieval Welsh manuscripts. The Welsh mythology of this latter work, especially the Four Branches of the Mabinogi (from which Guest derived her title), is particularly important in Owen Glendower and in Powys's next novel Porius.John Brebner describes The Mabinogion \"as \"indispensable for understanding Powys's later novels\", by which he means Owen Glendower and Porius (fn, p. 191). Jeremy Hooker sees The Mabinogion as having \"a significant presence [\u2026] through character's knowledge of its stories and identification of themselves or others with figures or incidents in the stories\".\"John Cowper Powys: 'Figure of the Marches'\", in his Imagining Wales (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2001), p. 106. When Rhisiart, for example, first sees Owen Glendower, he remarks, \"I'll be damned if he doesn't look like [\u2026] Pryderi!\", while earlier, in Chapter Two, Tegolin remarks that when Rhisiart defended her he \"looked like Pwyll [\u2026] riding against Halfgan [\u2026] King of Annwn.W. J. Keith, p. 46. Indeed there are \"almost fifty allusions to these four [\u2026] tales\"' (The Four Branches of the Mabinogi) in the novel, though \"some that are fairly obscure and inconspicuous\".Keith, p. 44. Two thirds of Powys's allusions are from \"Branwen, daughter of Ll\u0177r\", whose main character is Br\u00e2n the Blessed, Bendigeidfran, a giant and king of Britain, who Powys associates with the fortress of Rhisiart's ancestors, Castell Dinas Br\u00e2n (though there is no known connection with the castle and this mythological hero).Keith, p. 45. There are also important associations between Bran and another setting in the novel, Harlech. Powys also draws on \"Culhwch and Olwen\" (a tale about a hero connected with King Arthur and his warriors), the \"Book of Taliesin\", both also found in Guest's Mabinogion, as well as mentioning Merlin, and the poet Aneirin, so that is \"clear that [he] intended his ideal reader to be made perpetually aware of the ancient Welsh mythical and literary heritage\". Pryderi, Pwll, and Bran are midway \"between gods and human beings\", and can move \"freely between the human world and Annwn, the Welsh 'Otherworld'\".Keith, p. 42. Jeremy Hooker, goes so far as to propose that \"the mythology is more essential, more integral, to this romance than its historical circumstances are\".p. 106. However, Glen Cavaliero suggests that \"the mythogical element\" is more \"a kind of continuous undertow\" and \"for the most part it is the outward action which carries the message of the [novel]\".p. 108.", "Many critics have noted the importance of the idea of the \"mythology of escape\" in Owen Glendower.For example, Glen Cavaliero, John Cowper Powys: Novelist, pp. 108-9; C. A. Coates, John Cowper Powys in Search of a Landscape, pp.135-7; Jeremy Hooker, \"Figure of the Marches\", p. 106. Indeed this philosophy of Glendower is the means whereby Powys transforms his protagonist's historical defeat by the English \"into a kind of triumph\".W. J. Keith, p.77, Indeed after his defeat at Worcester Glendower refers to his \"triumph in spirit\".Owen Glendower (1941), p. 822, quoted by W. J. Keith, Aspects of John Cowper Powys's 'Owen Glendower' , p. 57. Powys describes this \"mythology of escape\", in his essay \"Welsh Culture\" (1939), as \"the secret of the people of this land [Wales]\" and goes on to note that \"[o]ther races love and hate, conquer and are conquered. This race [the Welsh]  avoids and evades, pursues and is pursued. Its route forever makes double flight\".First published in The Welsh Review, in Obstinate Cymric: Essays 1935-1947 (The Druid Press, Carmarthen, 1947), p. 47; quoted by Glen Cavaliero, p. 108. Welsh writer Herbert Williams \"finds disturbing hints of other Powys heroes or anti-heroes, traces in fact of Powys himself\" in this version of history's Owen Glendower.p.125. Cambridge poet and scholar Glen Cavaliero also notes that Glendower is \"an elementalist of the kind depicted in so many of John Cowper's novels\". Indeed the \"mythology of escape\" is just such a contemplative philosophy and it is this\u2014with its propensity for contemplation and introspection\u2014that proves \"fatal to his hopes of delivering Wales\".Cavaliero, p. 112. What Glendower does is turns a physical defeat into a spiritual victory, because, \"[h]e could not act as an aggressor [\u2026] [h]e knew how his soul could escape, escape without looting cities and ravishing women\".p.136", "Owen Glendower's introspective nature is explored by Harald Fawkner, in The Ecstatic World of John Cowper Powys,(Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1986) where he comments on the contrast between Rhisiart's lack of introspection: \"[h]e has 'all the average Norman's dislike of introspective analysis' \", and Glendower's constant self-examination, and Fawkner suggests that the novelist identified with Glendower. Fawkner quotes from Powys's Confessions of Two Brothers,Harald Fawkner, The Ecstatic World of John Cowper Powys, pp. 80-81. in which the Powys deplores \"widely spread\" current view that \" 'introspection' is a danerous and immoral thing\".Harald Fawkner, p. 80. Confessions, (New York: Manas Press, 1916), p. 18. Like Powys himself and his other fictional heroes, Glendower, Fawkner argues, is \"caught in a tremendous struggle between  Ego and Self\".Harald Fawkner, p. 82. Jeremy Hooker also emphasize this aspect of Owen Glendower, suggesting that Powys is less interested in \"political and military matters\" than in \"consciousness, uses of the mind and will, and emotional and sexual experience\".\"John Cowper Powys: Figure in the Marches, in Imagining Wales (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2001), p. 106."]}, {"page": "2014 in poetry", "response": ["* Cholmondeley Award: W.
