He had 50 known first-class appearances between 1775 and 1792. His name was pronounced \"Borra\".\nBowra is thought to have been born at Sevenoaks, Kent.  In a Hampshire Chronicle report of a 1775 game, his name is spelt \"Bower\". Bowra was a useful batsman who was employed by John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset as a gamekeeper. He is believed to have been an outstanding fielder in close positions as a great many catches were credited to him.The Duke of Dorset was a great admirer of his play and the sources have recorded, perhaps as an anecdote, that Dorset used to sit on the railing round the Sevenoaks Vine ground to watch him bat, often exclaiming: \"Bravo, my little Bowra\".Bowra subsequently played for the Brighton team during 1790\u20131792 and once made 60 not out for Brighton v Marylebone Cricket Club. At this time he was perhaps employed on one of Dorset\u2019s estates in Sussex. He returned to Knole House in 1807, again as gamekeeper, and it is believed he stayed there till his death in 1820.", "link_mentions": {}}}
