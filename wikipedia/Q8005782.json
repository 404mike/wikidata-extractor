He had 50 known first-class appearances between 1775 and 1792. His name was pronounced \"Borra\".\nBowra is thought to have been born at Sevenoaks, Kent.  In a Hampshire Chronicle report of a 1775 game, his name is spelt \"Bower\". Bowra was a useful batsman who was employed by John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset as a gamekeeper. He is believed to have been an outstanding fielder in close positions as a great many catches were credited to him.The Duke of Dorset was a great admirer of his play and the sources have recorded, perhaps as an anecdote, that Dorset used to sit on the railing round the Sevenoaks Vine ground to watch him bat, often exclaiming: \"Bravo, my little Bowra\".Bowra subsequently played for the Brighton team during 1790\u20131792 and once made 60 not out for Brighton v Marylebone Cricket Club. At this time he was perhaps employed on one of Dorset\u2019s estates in Sussex. He returned to Knole House in 1807, again as gamekeeper, and it is believed he stayed there till his death in 1820.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English cricketers to 1771", "response": ["| Known as the \"Kentish Shepherd\" and believed to be the father of William Bowra.Buckley, 18th century, p. 15.", "| William Bowra"]}, {"page": "Bromley Cricket Club", "response": ["Apart from Colchin, Bromley also produced noted players like John Bowra, his son William Bowra and the brothers James and John Bryant."]}, {"page": "Bowra", "response": ["* William Bowra (1752\u20131820), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sevenoaks", "response": ["*William Bowra (1752\u20131820) cricketer"]}, {"page": "1782 in sports", "response": ["* Most runsNote that scorecards created in the 18th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the known totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages \u2013 William Bowra 144"]}, {"page": "The Cricketers of My Time", "response": ["Numerous Georgian players are described in the book but, as the newest version's editor has pointed out, there are several omissions including John Boorman, William Bowra, William Bullen, Robert Clifford, Samuel Colchin, John Edmeads, William Fennex and Richard Aubrey Veck; while other notable players such as Francis Booker, Robert Robinson and Thomas Scott receive only the briefest of mentions.Nyren (ed.

The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three \"given men\" (i.e., borrowed players), on each side the match is also called Duke of Dorset's XI versus Sir Horatio Mann's XI after the two team patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann. The \"East Kent\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire. The \"West Kent\" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players Noah Mann and Tom Sueter with the Chertsey and Surrey players William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens. Noted Kent players involved in the match include Joseph Miller, William Bullen, William Bowra, Robert Clifford and Thomas Pattenden.Haygarth, pp. 47\u201348. Sevenoaks Vine was Dorset's home ground and there was a return match at Bourne Paddock at Mann's Bourne Park House near Bishopsbourne from 8 to 11 August. This also featured guest players with Surrey's William Yalden and Hampshire's James Aylward joining Small, Lamborn, Sueter, Bedster, Mann and Stevens.Haygarth, pp. 49\u201350.

Lumpy Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey was, as Haygarth says, a \"given man\" on the Hambledon/Hampshire side but, in addition, the team included Earl of Winchilsea (White Conduit Club), Edward Hussey (Kent) and William Fennex (Middlesex). The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex. The other nine were usually associated with Kent: Stephen Amherst, James Aylward (though he played for Hampshire until 1779), Francis Booker, John Boorman, William Bowra, William Brazier, William Bullen, Robert Clifford and Henry Crozoer."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|William Bowra"]}]}}
