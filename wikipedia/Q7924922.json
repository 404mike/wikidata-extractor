Vic Tandy, experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law at Coventry University, along with Dr. Tony Lawrence of the University's psychology department, wrote in 1998 a paper called \"Ghosts in the Machine\" for the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Their research suggested that an infrasonic signal of 19\u00a0Hz might be responsible for some ghost sightings. Tandy was working late one night alone in a supposedly haunted laboratory at Warwick, when he felt very anxious and could detect a grey blob out of the corner of his eye. When Tandy turned to face the grey blob, there was nothing.", "Tandy investigated this phenomenon further and wrote a paper entitled The Ghost in the Machine. He carried out a number of investigations at various sites believed to be haunted, including the basement of the Tourist Information Bureau next to Coventry Cathedral and Edinburgh Castle.Who ya gonna call?

This \"spook\" was characterised by a feeling of unease and vague glimpses of a grey apparition. Some detective work implicated a newly installed extractor fan that, Tandy found, was generating infrasound of 18.9\u00a0Hz, 0.3\u00a0Hz, and 9\u00a0Hz."]}, {"page": "Tandy (name)", "response": ["* Vic Tandy (1955\u20132005), British lecturer"]}]}}
