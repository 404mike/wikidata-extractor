Gus's behaviour tended to be excellent for Roger Shaw, but for Judi Spiers and Iain Stirling he could be rather unpredictable.

Alternatives to bunny hops were ear waggles, head stands, winks and later \"putting out the lights\" and a colour-distorting \"magic button\". Gus appeared with virtually every Westward/TSW presenter, including the late Ian Stirling, Fern Britton, Judi Spiers, David Fitzgerald, Ruth Langsford & Sally Meen.
