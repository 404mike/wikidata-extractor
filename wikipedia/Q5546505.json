The decision seemed to unnerve Newcastle, and they once again lost impetus. Palace then took the lead through Horace Astley not long before half-time. Reports differ as to whether Astley seized on a clearance or received a pass from George Woodger,* but the old Millwall opportunist managed to evade the Newcastle defenders and crash a shot past an astonished Jimmy Lawrence. The Magpies started the second half the stronger side, but although they had the better of the play and possession, they failed to make it count. Palace were quick on the counter-attack, and Lawrence twice had to deny Woodger the chance to double the lead in the fifteen minutes after the restart. Palace's attacking energy was lost after a crunching collision between Newcastle's forward Speedie and Palace's centre half Ryan.  Both men were injured, and whilst Newcastle pushed Speedie out wide, Palace left Ryan in the middle but also pulled back Woodger, Astley and Harker in an attempt to close the game down. With Palace sitting back, Newcastle threw everything into attacking football. With six minutes to go Ryan was again injured, this time forced off the field, leaving Palace reduced to ten men.", "| ||  || George Woodger", "Of the Crystal Palace players involved in the match George Woodger would go on to play for Oldham Athletic and represent England on one occasion, while Charlie Wallace would move to Aston Villa and win both the League in 1910 and the FA Cup in 1913 and 1920.
