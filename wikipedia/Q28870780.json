In \"I Need Help,\" as in \"Some Context,\" many of the copies of the book were shredded. For Okoyomon's contribution to the show, they made a series of dolls consisting of raw wool bound by yarn.

", "Curated by Susanne Pfeffer, at the MMK in Frankfurt, Earthseed is Okoyomon's first institutional solo exhibition in Germany and their largest show to date. The exhibition's title is the name of a fictional religion in Octavia E. Butler\u2019s books Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents, that proposes \"the Earth\u2019s seed can be transplanted anywhere and, through adaptation, will survive.\" Like the imagined religion, Okoyomon's exhibition envisions a \"theology of mutation, flux, and motion.\"In a piece called \"resistance is an atmospheric condition,\" Okoyomon filled the gallery space with the Japanese vine Kudzu. Responding to the gallery building's history as a passport office, Okoyomon used the invasive plant as an artwork to comment on ideas about immigration, invasion, race, and what is allowed to be considered natural. The show's press release recounts how Kudzu was first imported to the American South in 1876 with the intention that when planted its roots would strengthen the ecosystem's soil which as result of the excessive over cultivation of cotton by chattel slaves during the period was threatened by wide spread erosion. While the vine in some respects served its intended purpose and remains even today a foundational and necessary bulwark against the dissolution of the region's soil, the speed at which the vine was able to grow, when removed from its original planting and its natural predators, allowed it to consume massive tracts of land earning it the name \"the vine that ate the south.\" Soon, growing or planting of Kudzu was made a criminal offense in many states. Okoyomon suggests that despite the fact that vine's \"specific history as a failed remedy for the monumental toll slavery took on the ecological system of the American South has been largely forgotten,\" Kudzu might serve as a metaphor for Blackness itself, which like the plant, became monstrous when removed from its home in Africa and was taken to the states, where it functioned simultaneously as \"indispensable to and irreconcilable with Western civilization.\" The show also includes six large scale sculptures, made out of raw wool, modeled after the dolls Okoyomon first exhibited in their first collaborative exhibition \"I NEED HELP\" with Hannah Black.
