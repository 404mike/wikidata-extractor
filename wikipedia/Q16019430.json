Paine himself considered that Kemp's runs \"didn't warrant all that energy\" and, while exciting the crowd, they became \"infectious\" and began to \"rub off on the other players\" to the detriment of the team. Following the signing of Brian O'Neil in the summer of 1970, Kemp was no longer required and was sold to Blackpool in November for a fee of \u00a335,000."]}]}}
