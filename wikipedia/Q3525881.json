He toured Australia as a member of the 1924-25 side, acting as reserve wicket-keeper and playing in three Test matches. He scored 75 at Adelaide and 76 at Melbourne. \nAfter being the leading batsman in Nottinghamshire's County Championship-winning side of 1929, Whysall was recalled to the England Test team for the decisive match of the 1930 series against Australia. The move was not a success. Whysall scored only 13 and 10, and was criticised for his lack of mobility in the field, as England lost by an innings.\nBarely two months later, Whysall was dead. He slipped on a dance floor, injured his elbow, and died within two weeks from septicaemia despite a blood transfusion.Whysall was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1925.", "link_mentions": {}}}
