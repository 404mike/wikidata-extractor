He was a right-hand batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler who played for Warwickshire.\nBorn in Swinton, Lancashire, Charlesworth began his first-class career in 1898 and played regularly for Warwickshire until 1921. Despite missing a number of seasons because of the First World War, he still made 372 matches for the county scoring 14,289 at an average of 23.61 and taking 295 wickets at 30.09.\nDescribed by Wisden as 'A brilliant batsman specially strong in driving', Charlesworth passed 1,000 runs in a season five times. His most productive season came in 1911 when he scored 1,376 runs at 38.22, including four centuries. These runs assisted Warwickshire to their first County Championship title.Charlesworth scored 15 first-class centuries, two of which he converted into doubles. The first of these came in 1910 when he scored 216 against Derbyshire, the innings lasting three hours and forty minutes. The second came in 1914 when he struck 206 against a strong Yorkshire attack including George Hirst and Wilfred Rhodes.Charlesworth's pace bowling garnered seven five-wicket hauls, the first two of these came in the same match when he took match figures of 10/135 in a 16-run victory over Surrey in 1901. Later that season he recorded the best innings figures of his career when taking 6/45 against Derbyshire.\nIn 1920 he was awarded a benefit match which generated \u00a31041, the figure was a Warwickshire record which remained unsurpassed until 1945. In his final season, after Charlesworth had made a fine 81 out of 138 v Somerset, he suffered a nasty injury to his eye, being hit by a shot played by Jack MacBryan whilst fielding at short leg.In 1925 and 1926 Charlesworth was on the umpires list, standing in 42 matches. He died in Halifax, West Yorkshire, aged 78.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Fereday", "response": ["In 1900, Fereday made six appearances for the county, though he could muster only 77 runs in 11 innings with a best of just 18. He did, however, take his only two first-class wickets that summer: a caught and bowled dismissal of the little-known Yorkshire bowler Harry Riley and an lbw decision against Warwickshire stalwart Crowther Charlesworth. The following year he made his last two appearances at first-class level, his final match being a thrilling tie against the touring South Africans in which he made a career-best score of 37."]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 283 (9th wicket) || Arnold Warren & John Chapman (Derbyshire)Warwickshire won the toss and batted first, scoring 504 for seven declared, including 216 from Crowther Charlesworth.

Between 1899 and 1903, he made ten Minor Counties Championship appearances for Northamptonshire.  Northamptonshire were granted first-class status for the 1905 season and were admitted to the County Championship.  Thorneycroft later made two first-class appearances for the county in the 1907 County Championship against Kent and Warwickshire.  In the match against Kent at the Private Banks Sports Ground, Catford Bridge, Thorneycroft took the wicket of Arthur Day.  In Northamptonshire's first-innings, he was dismissed for a duck batting at number eleven by Charlie Blythe, and when Northamptonshire were forced to follow-on he was promoted to open the batting, scoring just 3 runs before being dismissed by the same bowler.  In the match against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, he once again batted at number eleven in Northamptonshire's first-innings, during which he was dismissed for a duck by Sam Hargreave.  In their second-innings he was promoted up the order once more, this time to number six, scoring 2 runs before being dismissed by the same bowler.
