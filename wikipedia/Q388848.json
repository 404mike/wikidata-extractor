Joseph Severn was an artist and a friend of the poet Keats. Newton was taught to draw by her father, and then on the Severn family's return to England in 1841, studied with George Richmond, who employed her to produce copies of portraits he had painted. In 1857 she received lessons from Ary Scheffer in Paris. In Paris she painted a portrait of Mary Bruce, Countess of Elgin which was well reviewed and led to further society commissions in Britain. She specialised in portraits of children and worked in crayon, chalk, pastel and watercolour. In the mid-1850s she supported her family with a number of commissions, travelling to the homes of wealthy patrons. Her first picture to be exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts was The Twins in 1852, a portrait of her younger brother and sister. During this time she also painted portraits of Queen Victoria's nephew and children."]}, {"page": "Mary Nisbet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary Bruce, Countess of Elgin"]}, {"page": "Mary Bruce (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Mary Bruce, Countess of Elgin (1778\u20131855), first wife of British diplomat Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin"]}, {"page": "Mary Hamilton Nisbet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary Bruce, Countess of Elgin"]}, {"page": "1778 in Scotland", "response": ["* 18 April \u2013 Mary Bruce, Countess of Elgin, n\u00e9e Nisbet (died 1855)"]}]}}
