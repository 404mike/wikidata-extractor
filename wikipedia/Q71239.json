He was signed by his hometown club Sunderland for \u00a310 million in 2012. Johnson played at various levels for England, earning 12 caps at senior level.\nIn March 2015, Johnson was arrested and charged over sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, with England's age of consent being 16. Johnson continued to play for Sunderland during his bail. The following February, he pleaded guilty to two charges against him, the other being one of child grooming, and was subsequently sacked by Sunderland.
