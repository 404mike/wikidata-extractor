Beth Chatto learned about plants from Morris, but was dismayed when he advised her to move house if she wanted to create a great garden. Chatto had a friend who lived nearby named Pamela Underwood, who had a nursery and was keen on flower arranging. She persuaded Chatto to get involved and they were two of the founder members of the second flower arranging club in the country, in Colchester. From the late 1950s, Chatto was involved in the Flower Club movement, lecturing, opening new clubs and demonstrating flower arranging. Members became an enthusiastic audience for unusual plants and a mail order business began from a small hand-typed sheet. From 1960, the Chattos worked on developing the Chatto Gardens and in 1967 the nursery was opened. In 1978 Chatto's first book, The Dry Garden, was published by J. M. Dent."]}, {"page": "Nigel Colborn", "response": ["His mother was the nursery woman Pamela Underwood."]}]}}
