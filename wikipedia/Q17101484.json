His  family effectively owned the town of Tralee and had great political influence in Kerry.\nDenny was the son of Sir Barry Denny, 1st Baronet and his  wife and cousin Jane Denny, and the younger brother of Sir Barry Denny, 2nd Baronet. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin.He held the office of High Sheriff of Kerry in 1794 and was Deputy Lieutenant of County Kerry. On 20 October 1794 he succeeded to his brother's baronetcy, after Sir Barry was killed in a duel with John Gustavus Crosbie. This  incident led to a bitter feud  between the two families, and the  sudden death  of Crosbie, after falling from his horse in 1797,  led to a local tradition that Edward had arranged for his murder  as an act of vengeance. He was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as a Tory Member of Parliament for Tralee in September 1828, but resigned after less than a year in June 1829 due to poor health. He died two years later.He married Elizabeth Day, daughter of  Hon. Robert Day, judge  of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland)  and  his first wife Mary (Polly)  Potts,  on 26 May 1795,  and together they had six children. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denny baronets", "response": ["*Sir Edward Denny, 3rd Baronet (c. 1773\u20131831)"]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet", "response": ["He was the eldest son of Sir Edward Denny, 3rd Baronet and Elizabeth Day, daughter of the Hon.
