Through the latter he claimed descent from Rhirid Flaidd, a 12th-century nobleman of Powys.\nIn common with other poets of the time much of his work is \"praise-poetry\" directed at the Uchelwyr, or Welsh nobility, including members of the Abertanad family and the Wynns of Gwydir. Ieuan was of a gentry family himself so is unlikely to have been a 'professional' writer. His satire on the borough of Flint also survives along with several humorous disputations with the famous poet Guto'r Glyn.\nHis work has occasionally been confused in manuscripts with that of his father, and he seems to have had a sister, Gwenllian, who may also have been a poet.His surviving poetry was edited by Thomas Roberts in 1958, in a single volume with the work of Tudur Penllyn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh-language poets (6th century to c. 1600)", "response": ["*Ieuan ap Tudur Penllyn"]}, {"page": "Tudur Penllyn", "response": ["Tudur was married to Gwerful Fychan (Gwerful ferch Ieuan Fychan ap Ieuan ap Hywel y Gadair ap Gruffudd ap Madog ap Rhirid Flaidd, not be confused with Gwerful Mechain), who was herself a poet.
