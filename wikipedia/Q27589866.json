While completing a marine engineering apprenticeship, he played football as an amateur for Gateshead. In March 1962, he turned professional with Brighton & Hove Albion, about to be relegated to the Football League Third Division. He was initially unpopular because he had displaced captain Roy Jennings from the team, but soon established himself as first-choice centre half and was twice voted Albion's Player of the Season. Over 12 years with the club, he made 440 appearances in the Football League and 488 in all first-team competitions. Albion's long-serving goalkeeper Brian Powney said Gall \"was the best player [he] ever played with because of his consistency over all the years.\""]}]}}
