Despite having been in the youth team only for a short amount of time, he was given a surprising last minute call up to the first team at only 16 years of age. Boyd eventually made his debut against Shrewsbury Town and was an immediate success after coming on a substitute and scoring a dramatic last minute goal from a tight angle in his debut game. However, Boyd's early promise quickly faded as the team relinquished him to the reserves and he struggled to make an impact. From the 1999 season to 2003, Boyd had started a total of 25 first team matches and made 38 substitution appearances. Despite being on the field often, Boyd only managed to score 15 goals."]}]}}
