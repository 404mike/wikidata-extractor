Only three gold coins of Offa's have survived: one is a copy of an Abbasid dinar of 774 and carries Arabic text on one side, with \"Offa Rex\" on the other. The gold coins are of uncertain use but may have been struck to be used as alms or for gifts to Rome.", "Offa's wife was Cynethryth, whose ancestry is unknown. The couple had a son, Ecgfrith, and at least three daughters: \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, Eadburh and \u00c6thelburh.Kelly, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography It has been speculated that \u00c6thelburh was the abbess who was a kinswoman of King Ealdred of the Hwicce, but there are other prominent women named \u00c6thelburh during that period.", "In East Anglia, Beonna probably became king in about 758. Beonna's first coinage predates Offa's own, and implies independence from Mercia. Subsequent East Anglian history is quite obscure, but in 779 \u00c6thelberht II became king, and was independent long enough to issue coins of his own.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, pp.\u00a0164,\u00a0166. In 794, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, \"King Offa ordered King \u00c6thelberht's head to be struck off\". Offa minted pennies in East Anglia in the early 790s, so it is likely that \u00c6thelberht rebelled against Offa and was beheaded as a result.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a064. Accounts of the event have survived in which Aethelberht is killed through the machinations of Offa's wife Cynethryth, but the earliest manuscripts in which these possibly legendary accounts are found date from the 11th and 12th centuries, and recent historians do not regard them with confidence.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0210; Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p.\u00a0177; see also Zaluckyj & Zaluckyj, \"The Age of Mercian Supremacy\", in Zaluckyj et al., Mercia, pp.\u00a0152\u2013153, which gives the details of the earliest versions of the legend. The legend also claims that \u00c6thelberht was killed at Sutton St. Michael and buried  to the south at Hereford, where his cult flourished, becoming at one time second only to Canterbury as a pilgrimage destination.Blair, Church in Anglo-Saxon Society, p.\u00a0288.Zaluckyj & Zaluckyj, \"The Age of Mercian Supremacy\", in Zaluckyj et al., Mercia, p.\u00a0153.", "Offa was a generous patron of the church, founding several churches and monasteries, often dedicated to St Peter.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0116. Among these was St Albans Abbey, which he probably founded in the early 790s. He also promised a yearly gift of 365 mancuses to Rome; a mancus was a term of account equivalent to thirty silver pennies, derived from Abbasid gold coins that were circulating in Francia at the time.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0223. Control of religious houses was one way in which a ruler of the day could provide for his family, and to this end Offa ensured (by acquiring papal privileges) that many of them would remain the property of his wife or children after his death. This policy of treating religious houses as worldly possessions represents a change from the early 8th century, when many charters showed the foundation and endowment of small minsters, rather than the assignment of those lands to laypeople. In the 770s, an abbess named \u00c6thelburh (who may have been the same person as Offa's daughter of that name) held multiple leases on religious houses in the territory of the Hwicce; her acquisitions have been described as looking \"like a speculator assembling a portfolio\". \u00c6thelburh's possession of these lands foreshadows Cynethryth's control of religious lands, and the pattern was continued in the early 9th century by Cwoenthryth, the daughter of King Coenwulf.Blair, Church in Anglo-Saxon Society, pp.\u00a0129\u201330.", "Offa's diplomatic relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p.\u00a0175.Whitelock, English Historical Documents, 195, pp.\u00a0779\u2013780. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely \u00c6lffl\u00e6d. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters make it clear that by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to help make peace. In the end diplomatic relations were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0220.Whitelock, English Historical Documents, 20, p.\u00a0313.", "thumb|left|300px|Two silver pennies of Offa's reign.

He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p.\u00a050. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith \"has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you know very well how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son.\"Whitelock, English Historical Documents, 202, pp.\u00a0786\u2013788. It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0118.", "* Keynes, Simon, \"Cynethryth\", in "]}, {"page": "Penny", "response": ["The first Carolingian-style pennies were introduced by King Offa of Mercia ( 757\u2013796), modeled on Pepin's system.

As in the Frankish Empire, all these pennies were notionally fractions of shillings (; ) and pounds (; ) but during this period neither larger unit was minted. Instead, they functioned only as notional units of account. (For instance, a \"shilling\" or \"solidus\" of grain was a measure equivalent to the amount of grain that 12 pennies could purchase.)

Reverse designs included intricate crosses of various types, but the range of Offa's die-cutters encompassed other reverse designs including intertwining serpents, eels and the wolf and twins. Uniquely in Anglo-Saxon England, coins were also struck at Canterbury in the name of the queen, Cynethryth, from dies produced by the same talented individual responsible for the best of Offa's portrait dies. This practice could have been inspired by encounters with Roman coins in the names of empresses. It is also possible, though less likely, that the appearance of Irene on Byzantine coinage led Offa's queen to place her image on coins as well.
