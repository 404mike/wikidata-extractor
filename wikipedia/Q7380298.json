He founded the publishing company Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd.  As a biographer, he is remembered for his Hugh Walpole (1952), as an editor, for his Collected Letters of Oscar Wilde (1962), and, as both editor and part-author, for the Lyttelton/Hart-Davis Letters.\nWorking at a publishing firm before the Second World War, Hart-Davis began to forge literary relationships that would be important later in his career.  Founding his publishing company in 1946, Hart-Davis was praised for the quality of the firm's publications and production; but he refused to cater to public tastes, and the firm eventually lost money.  After relinquishing control of the firm, Hart-Davis concentrated on writing and editing, producing collections of letters and other works which brought him the sobriquet \"the king of editors.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
