At the beginning she was very terse. She was the head of the family and let everyone know it. She ruled with a rod of iron. She'd had a tough life. She'd had a rough ride with her husband Jacob, who used to drink the money away and sit in the Woolpack until all hours. Her son Jack didn't live at home then and it was Annie who kept the farm together. Until Henry Wilks (Arthur Pentelow) came along they were poor farmers, living hand-to-mouth.

He was known for his bushy sideburns, which were the result of Magill having rushed to the audition from playing an Edwardian character in a stage play. He thought he would be asked to shave the sideburns if he secured the part, but the producer told him they were ideal for the part and to keep them. At the beginning of the serial, Amos is the landlord of The Woolpack pub. Anthony Hayward described him as having a \"dour manner and pernickety ways.\" Magill saw himself in his character, although he admitted that he was more of \"a city slicker\". He also said Amos was the village gossip and a loner. This changed with the introduction of Henry Wilks (Arthur Pentelow), who formed a comic double act with Amos for 19 years. Magill explained: ", ":\"I saw him as a man who found it difficult to make friends, yet, once he was behind the bar and lord of all he surveyed, he was able to relate to people. But he had the bar between them, of course. Originally, Henry Wilks had nothing to do with the pub, but Kevin Laffan, the creator, spotted a rapport between me and Arthur Pentelow and came up with the idea of moving Henry into the Woolpack. Henry was originally to have been the villain of the piece and Amos was to find a wife and get married. Arthur and I had so much in common. We both loved doing The Times crossword every day \u2013 which is a great bond \u2013 both smoked a pipe and both liked good food and a bottle of wine.\""]}, {"page": "Sarah Sugden", "response": ["In September 1988, Jack leaves for Italy to see old flame Marian Wilks (Debbi Blythe) leaving Sarah unaware of where they stand.

The serial centred around the Sugdens, a farming family who owned Emmerdale Farm on the outskirts of Beckindale village. Laffan explained that he was interested by the notion that farming was \"a way of life\" and not just a way to earn a living, as well as \"the mental attitude\" that set them apart. This is why he introduced Henry, \"an industrialist from the outside world\" who comes into the farming community. After the show's story was mapped out, Laffan joined casting director Sue Whatmough, producer David Goddard, and director Tristan de Vere Cole for the casting process and interviews were carried out in May 1972 at Yorkshire Television's London offices. Laffan recalled that they wanted to cast actors that would gel well together, and Arthur Pentelow was \"an immediate choice\" for the role of Henry.
