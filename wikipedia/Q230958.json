Olivier did not enjoy making Wuthering Heights, and his approach to film acting, combined with a dislike for Oberon, led to tensions on set. The director, William Wyler, was a hard taskmaster, and Olivier learned to remove what Billington described as \"the carapace of theatricality\" to which he was prone, replacing it with \"a palpable reality\". The resulting film was a commercial and critical success that earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and created his screen reputation. Caroline Lejeune, writing for The Observer, considered that \"Olivier's dark, moody face, abrupt style, and a certain fine arrogance towards the world in his playing are just right\" in the role, while the reviewer for The Times wrote that Olivier \"is a good embodiment of Heathcliff\u00a0... impressive enough on a more human plane, speaking his lines with real distinction, and always both romantic and alive.\""]}, {"page": "Gary Cooper", "response": ["In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H.
