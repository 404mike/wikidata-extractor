His skills were shown on the pitch as the body double for Michael Caine's prisoner-of-war character, and the two became friends. Beattie had a cooler relationship with Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the film: \"There weren't too many that got on that well with him and after I beat him in an arm wrestle\u00a0\u2013 first my right arm and then my left \u2013 he didn't speak to me again\". A campaign for a permanent memorial to Beattie to be placed outside Portman Road, along with the existing statues of Robson and Ramsey, was started soon after his death by Ipswich Star and East Anglian Daily Times editor Brad Jones. The design for the statue was revealed on 19 March 2019 by local sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn. It was confirmed in August 2019 that the funds required to build the statue had been raised. On 18 December 2021, on what would have been Beattie's 68th birthday, his statue was officially unveiled outside of Portman Road."]}, {"page": "Captain Mainwaring", "response": ["In June 2010, a statue of Captain Mainwaring by sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn was erected in the Norfolk town of Thetford, where most of the TV series Dad's Army was filmed. The statue shows Captain Mainwaring sitting upright on a simple bench in Home Guard uniform, with his swagger stick across his knees. The statue is mounted at the end of a winding brick pathway with a Union Flag patterned arrowhead to reflect the opening credits of the TV series and the sculpture has been designed so that one can sit next to Captain Mainwaring and have one's photo taken."]}, {"page": "Westbourne Academy", "response": ["*Sean Hedges-Quinn, sculptor, animator and, film model and prop-maker."]}, {"page": "List of association football statues", "response": ["| Sean Hedges-Quinn", "| Sean Hedges-Quinn", "| Sean Hedges-Quinn", "| Sean Hedges-Quinn", "| Sean Hedges-Quinn"]}, {"page": "University of Bolton Stadium", "response": ["Club chaplain Phil Mason, chairman Phil Gartside and the son of Nat Lofthouse \u2013 Jeff Lofthouse, also took part in the ceremony as did sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn.

It stands on a 4-foot granite plinth and was erected near to the spot Hawkins would have stood when she addressed the public on the topic of women's suffrage. It portrays Hawkins speaking and gesturing with her right arm raised.", "The statue campaign was initiated and led by city Councillor Adam Clarke from 2012. Clarke formed the 'Alice Hawkins Legacy Group' alongside Hawkins' great grandson Peter Barratt. The group had the sole aim of fundraising for the statue. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby committed to the council's funding of a plinth and ongoing maintenance. Funding provided by trade unions supported a design competition that led to the commissioning of sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn. The statue itself was funded (\u00a362,400) by local businessman Jamie Lewis' charitable fund. Lewis' student accommodation portfolio includes the sensitively converted factory 'Equity Works', where Alice was employed as a shoe machinist."]}]}}
