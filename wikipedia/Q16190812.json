Criticism was made of Labour party resources in Scotland being assigned to favoured candidates such as Alexander and Curran.

After more than sixty front-bench resignations, and a vote of no confidence with 80% of Labour MPs supporting the motion against Corbyn, Milne was accused by the Labour Party's former strategist John McTernan in the London Evening Standard of talking Corbyn out of resigning. According to Robert Peston, other sources have disputed this claim."]}]}}
