The only try of the match was then set up by Australian replacement back Kevin Walters, who, with a clever cut-out pass, put his Broncos teammate Steve Renouf into a gap not covered by replacement Lions centre John Devereux. Renouf, in his debut test for Australia, then raced 20 metres to score in the corner. Otherwise, the two teams' kickers (Mal Meninga and Deryck Fox) were called upon to score most of the points, including Meninga's pressure sideline conversion of Renouf's try.

Halfback Ricky Stuart badly broke and dislocated his right ankle in the second half and despite a club record 68\u20130 win, without their halfback and chief play maker, the Raiders fell apart. They lost their last minor round game to Canterbury-Bankstown 32\u20138, before meekly going out in straight sets in the finals with losses to eventual Grand Finalists St. George and premiers Brisbane. 1993 wasn't all bad though. Although Queensland lost their second straight State of Origin series under Menginga's captaincy, he did lead Australia to a Trans-Tasman Test series win over New Zealand in mid-season. Meninga though was forced to miss the first test at the Mount Smart Stadium in Auckland as he had been suspended for 2 weeks for the use of an elbow to Manly-Warringah's Welsh import centre John Devereux in the Raiders Round 10 match with the Sea Eagles at Brookvale Oval. After the Australians got away with a lucky 14-All draw in the first test, Meninga returned to the team (which was captained by New South Wales captain Laurie Daley in Auckland) for the second test win at Palmerston North on an extremely wet and cold night, as well the third test win at Lang Park."]}, {"page": "Widnes Vikings", "response": ["*120 John Devereux 1989\u201390 \u2013 1997"]}, {"page": "Cardiff Metropolitan University", "response": ["* John Devereux"]}, {"page": "1989 British Lions tour to Australia", "response": ["|John Devereux"]}, {"page": "Bridgend Ravens", "response": ["*  John Devereux"]}, {"page": "1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["The Kangaroos played an international tour match against Wales at Ninian Park in Cardiff on 30 October wearing their non-Test Australian jumpers for the game (for the first time in Kangaroo Tour history, the Kangaroos non-Test jumpers included yellow hoops around the waist leaving the traditional jumper to be used only in the Tests).
