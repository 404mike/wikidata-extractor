His first game was against Portugal in which they drew 1\u20131, with Collins scoring England's goal.\nChances of first team football were restricted at Sunderland and although Collins (who was urgently called back from International duty with England in Egypt) was named in the first team squad for an FA cup match against Blackburn, he had to leave in order to play in a first team environment.\nIn 2004 Collins left Sunderland and after trials with Birmingham City and Celtic, signed for Sheffield Wednesday with the ambitions of playing in front of 25,000 people every week. In his first season Collins played 34 games and played in the playoff final at Cardiff in front of 70,000 people; coming on as a second-half substitute with the team 2-1 down to turn the game around and win 2\u20134. Collins went on to feature for Sheffield Wednesday following promotion to the championship but an influx of signings meant first team chances were restricted. After a loan spell at Swindon Town Collins decided to return to the North East and sign for Darlington FC in 2006.\nCollins played 37 games in his first season at Darlington, captaining the side on several occasions, including a successful FA cup run ending at the hands of then premier league side Aston Villa. Unfortunately chronic calf cramps restricted him from staying fit and in his second season he went on loan to Oxford FC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Patrick Collins", "response": ["Patrick Collins may refer to:", "* Patrick Collins (director), American pornographic film producer and director", "* Patrick Collins (footballer) (born 1985), player from England", "* Patrick Collins (mayor) (1844\u20131905), U.S. Representative from Massachusetts and mayor of Boston", "* Patrick Collins (painter) (1911\u20131994), Irish painter", "* Patrick Collins (American football) (born 1966), American football player", "* Patrick Collins (hurler) (born 1996), Irish hurler"]}, {"page": "Collins (surname)", "response": ["***Edmund John Patrick Collins (1931\u20132014), Australian Roman Catholic bishop", "*Pat, Patricia and Patrick Collins (disambiguation), multiple people, one of several people including:", "****Patrick Collins (mayor) (1844\u20131905), Irish-born American politician", "****Patrick Collins (painter) (1911\u20131994), Irish painter", "****Patrick Collins (American football) (born 1966), American football player", "****Patrick Collins (footballer) (born 1985), player from England", "****Patrick Collins (director), American pornographic film producer and director", "**Thomas Patrick Collins (1915\u20131973), American-born Catholic bishop in Bolivia"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["*  Patrick Collins -  Darlington, free"]}, {"page": "2005 Football League One play-off Final", "response": ["|DF || 12 ||Patrick Collins || || "]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|12||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Patrick Collins"]}]}}
