He released a variety of singles under the pseudonym Rufige Kru and co-founded the label Metalheadz. He later released several albums under his own name, including the 1995 album Timeless, which entered the UK charts at number 7.\nGoldie's acting credits include the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, Guy Ritchie's Snatch (2000) and the BBC soap opera EastEnders (2001\u20132002).

From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and \"hardcore noises\" and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as hardcore jungle (later to become simply jungle), whilst darkcore (with producers such as Goldie, Doc Scott, 4hero, and 2 Bad Mice) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.", "Drum and bass is dominated by a small group of record labels. These are run mainly by DJ\u2013producers, such as London Elektricity's Hospital Records, Andy C and Scott Bourne's RAM, Goldie's Metalheadz, Fabio and Sarah Sandy's Creative Source Records,  Kasra's Critical Music, DJ Friction's Shogun Audio, DJ Fresh's Breakbeat Kaos, Ed Rush & Optical's  Virus Recordings, Futurebound's Viper Recordings and DJ Hype, Pascal, NoCopyrightSounds and formerly DJ Zinc's True Playaz (now known as Real Playaz as of 2006).", "The earliest mainstream drum and bass releases include Shy FX and UK Apache's single \"Original Nuttah\" from 1994 and Goldie's album Timeless from 1995.

But \"Rocket 88\" does have a couple of elements which \"The Fat Man\" did not. The wailing saxophone and that distorted electric guitar. It was number one in the rhythm and blues chart for five weeks, it is in the Grammy Hall of Fame and it was an indisputable claim to fame for Ike Turner....To critics he will be known as a great founder, unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man.Nigel Cawthorne\u2014co-author of Turner's autobiography\u2014said:Although there had been black rock 'n' rollers who had made it big already, they really only played to a white audience. Ike and Tina played to a mixed audience and he deliberately desegregated audiences in the southern states and he wouldn't play to any segregated audiences at all. Because he had such a big band and entourage he desegregated a lot of the hotels because the hotel chains wouldn't want to miss out on the money they would make from him touring the southern states.Turner's songs have been sampled by hip hop artists, most notably Salt-n-Pepa used \"I'm Blue\" for their 1994 hit \"Shoop\". Jurassic 5 used \"Getting Nasty\" from A Black Man's Soul on the track \"Concrete Schoolyard\" in 1997, Main Source also sampled \"Getting Nasty\" on the track \"Snake Eyes\" as well as Ike & Tina Turner's \"Bold Soul Sister\" on \"Just Hanging Out\"; both featured on their 1991 album  Breaking Atoms.
