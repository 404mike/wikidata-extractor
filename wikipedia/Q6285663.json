She then started work in the recording studio, with producers such as; Dragonette, Diplo and Joseph Mount. Roberts after a year of recording announced that she would be releasing her debut album, Cinderella's Eyes. The first single \"Beat of My Drum\" had an on-sale release meaning it had little promotion beforehand and commercially it peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom but critically it garnered acclaim from critics which Roberts described as \"amazing\". A second single \"Lucky Day\" was released shortly after and whilst gaining positive reviews it failed to make an impact commercially peaking at number 40 in the UK. The album was then released on 23 September 2011, Roberts described the album as \"electronically led\", and the album was inspired by her time performing with Girls Aloud \u2013 \"It would have been stupid for me to make an album that meant nothing\" she said. For Roberts the album was about making a risky record, where there wasn't a guaranteed commercial success, explaining to The Guardian: \"It's taken every last bit of confidence just to release this record, or maybe I've just brainwashed myself into feeling more confident. I don't know if it's good, or if I've just told myself it's good.\" The album was released to universal positive reviews from critics, reviewers such as Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times, James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph, Emily Mackay of NME, Hugh Montgomery of The Independent and others hailed it as the best solo record from a member of Girls Aloud. Commercially in the United Kingdom the album peaked at number 17 whilst on the Digital charts it peaked at number 13, in Scotland it charted at number 21 whilst in Ireland it peaked at number 48. In late 2012, Roberts admitted during a secret show at Carphones Warehouse on Oxford St, to a small pool of journalists, that she was content with and prepared for the potential commercial fallout of releasing an album that was 'unlike anything out there'.

After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, \"Lucky Day\". The band were among the first to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: \"When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that.\" She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a \"more downbeat dance record\" noting it was what she was into at that point\". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track \"Beat of My Drum\", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, \"I had to ring him [Diplo] and\u2026 you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going to send you the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put the phone down, thinking, it's not in my hands now\". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it meant so much to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared \"I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius\". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent \"short beats\" to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.", "The album received praise from music critics upon its release. Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times found that Roberts had pushed her \"mainstream pop background to the limit\". He explained that whilst many expected the worst from another Girls Aloud band member, he noted \"You expect the worst \u2013 well, not worse than Cole's terrible albums, but not good \u2013 only to discover that Cinderella\u2019 s Eyes is actually very promising\". Robert Copsey from Digital Spy found that without listening to the album the impact would be limited as she had a \"troubled start\" and \"limited solo spots\" with band Girls Aloud but after listening to the record he expressed that her transition to a \"trendy solo songstress is one discussed with admirable honesty throughout her debut offering\". James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph gave the album four stars out of five and stated \"Nicola Roberts has made an assured solo debut that suggests she may outlast her flashier bandmates as a pop star of substance\", he positively commented on her use of a \"autobiographical lyrics\" and compared the album to that of artist Robyn. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five, calling \"Beat of My Drum\", \"infectiously bratty\" and positively responded to the track \"Porcelain Heart\" saying, \"her Florence-bothering bellow of \"heaaaaaart\" on the fearsome \"Porcelain Heart\", Roberts sounds utterly self-assured.\" Rick Pearson of the Evening Standard felt that her Cinderella-persona for the album concept was appropriate to her life story calling the record \"a glittering pop song furnished with yelping Kate Bush-isms \u2013 while Metronomy's Joseph Mount drops by to produce the haunting highlight Fish out of Water.
