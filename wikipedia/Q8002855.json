The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often abandon recognisable language.

Upon learning that Cocteau Twins' founding member and bassist Will Heggie had recently departed that band (after a lengthy and reportedly difficult European tour), Guthrie asked Heggie to help Dead Neighbours out in finishing the album's recording and join them on a tour opening for Johnny Thunders.  Heggie agreed and, after the album was completed and the tour was done, he stayed on and began rehearsing new material with the band.  Guthrie noticed that with Heggie, the entire chemistry of the group suddenly changed and they began forging a completely new, atmospheric sound very different from their original Cramps-influenced beginnings.  Apparently unhappy with the direction they were clearly aiming for, Buchanan abruptly departed the band.  A new guitarist was brought in, Stuart Everest, who adapted quickly to the band's updated vision.  In 1984, the group retired the Dead Neighbours moniker for good and rechristened themselves as Lowlife.
