M. W. Turner produced his watercolour Crook of Lune, looking towards Hornby Castle, capturing a view seen from the same \"station\" that Gray had used in the previous century but altering the topography of the scene for artistic effect.  It has been called \"one of the grandest and loveliest panoramas that Turner ever created\".  An engraving of it was taken by John Wykeham Archer and published in Thomas Dunham Whitaker's History of Richmondshire."]}]}}
