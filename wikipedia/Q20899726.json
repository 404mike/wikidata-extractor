His work was exhibited with his friends and mentors William Morris Hunt and Joseph Foxcroft Cole, at shows of the Boston Art Club, and at prominent galleries. In the fall of 1874, he and his wife Agnes went to France to study and paint. He displayed and sold works in the Paris Salon of 1875, whose jurors included established Barbizon school painters. The Browns typically maintained a winter studio in Boston and had a summer house in West Newbury, whose surrounds comprised the rural New England landscapes which were frequent subjects of his art. Starting in 1879, both Browns had annual exhibitions at Boston's Doll and Richards gallery. At this time Brown's paintings and drawings were used as book illustrations."]}, {"page": "Wildwood Cemetery", "response": ["Notable persons buried in the cemetery include Massachusetts Governor Samuel Walker McCall (1851-1923), Rev.
