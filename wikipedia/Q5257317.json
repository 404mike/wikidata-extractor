That December, he was found guilty and sentenced to eight months' imprisonment. After the passing of the Evicted Tenants Act, 1908, some of this holding, but not his house, was returned to him.He died at his residence in Luggacurran in 1924 aged 76 and was buried in Clopook cemetery.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
