He rushed a machine gun post, shooting two of the team and bayoneting another. He then destroyed the gun and continued his way along the enemy trench. He single-handedly rushed an enemy dugout which contained 37 Germans and compelled them to surrender. These acts of gallantry saved the company heavy casualties and materially assisted in the success of the operation. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for these actions.Harvey later achieved the rank of sergeant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burgess Park", "response": ["Recent additions to the park include Silent Raid, an art installation by Sally Hogarth commemorating Zeppelin raids on the local area in 1917 and a memorial to locally-born Jack Harvey VC."]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Jack Harvey || British Army  || 1918 || First World War || Peronne"]}, {"page": "Jack Harvey", "response": ["Jack Harvey may refer to:", "*Jack Harvey (basketball) (1918\u20131981), American basketball player", "*Jack Harvey (VC) (1891\u20131940), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*Jack Harvey (director) (1881\u20131954), American actor, director and screenwriter", "*Jack Harvey (racing driver) (born 1993), British auto racing driver", "*Jack Harvey (politician) (1907\u20131986), American politician", "*Jack Harvey, pen name of Ian Rankin, Scottish novelist", "*Jack Harvey (greyhound trainer) (1907-1996), British champion trainer"]}]}}
