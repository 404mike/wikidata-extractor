The seat had been held by the Conservatives since its creation in 1885, and Hoult's predecessor Edward Cotton-Jodrell had been returned unopposed in 1886 and 1895. However, Hoult's majority of 1,005 votes (9% of the total) was less than a third of that won by his predecessor in 1892; in a growing electorate, the number of Conservative votes had remained static while the Liberal vote grew. At the next election, in 1906, Hoult was defeated by the Liberal candidate William Lever (later Viscount Leverhulme). He did not stand for Parliament again, although his name was mentioned as a possible candidate in the Liverpool Kirkdale by-election in 1907."]}]}}
