When that constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, he was returned to the House of Commons for the new Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles constituency.\nHe held the seat until his death in 1964.

The economic and social implications of the proposed closure were of concern to a number of Government ministries, including the Scottish Office which, in April 1964, requested the Minister of Transport to ask Beeching to postpone publication of closure notices for the Waverley Route. The Scottish Economic Planning Council also asked the Minister to hold fire on any proposals, due to the nature, size and importance of the region served by the line. In the 1964 general election, the Unionist Party Member of Parliament for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, Charles Donaldson, whose constituency covered Hawick and who had voted for the Beeching report, saw his majority cut by the Liberal candidate, David Steel, who had opposed closure of the railway line. Steel overturned the Conservative majority in a 1965 by-election; his opposition to the route's closure was one of the three main local issues of his campaign."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Donaldson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Donaldson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Donaldson"]}, {"page": "Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Donaldson"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Charles Donaldson"]}, {"page": "Roxburgh and Selkirk (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Donaldson"]}, {"page": "1965 Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election", "response": ["Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, a large rural constituency in the Scottish borders, had been safely Conservative for many years. The Liberal Party's 26-year-old candidate David Steel had dramatically cut Commander Charles Donaldson's majority in the general election of October 1964. When Donaldson died some months later it was clear that the ensuing by-election represented an opportunity for the Liberals to repeat previous by-election triumphs in Torrington and Orpington. However, the Conservatives were now in opposition rather than in government and the party's standing in the constituency was thought to have been further bolstered as their leader, Sir Alec Douglas-Home was himself a Scot, representing the rather similar constituency of Kinross and West Perthshire to the north."]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Charles Donaldson"]}, {"page": "1964 in Scotland", "response": ["* 11 December \u2013 Charles Donaldson, Conservative politician (born 1903)"]}, {"page": "1903 in Scotland", "response": ["* 15 March \u2013 Charles Donaldson, Conservative politician (died 1964)"]}, {"page": "Charles Donaldson", "response": ["Charles Donaldson may refer to:"]}]}}
