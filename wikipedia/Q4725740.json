Using her imposing physical stature to her advantage, she originated several of the early Gilbert and Sullivan \"formidable middle-aged ladies\", namely Ruth in The Pirates of Penzance (1879), Lady Jane in Patience (1881) and the Fairy Queen in Iolanthe (1882).  She then performed in various comic operas in Britain, America, Australia and New Zealand until 1889, earning strong critical praise.  After this, she toured in several of the Gaiety burlesques before creating the role of Dame Hecla Cortlandt in W. S. Gilbert and Osmond Carr's His Excellency in 1894.  From 1895, she played in Edwardian musical comedy, pantomime and non-musical plays until 1900.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["In November 1879, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sailed to America with a company of singing actors, to play both Pinafore and the new opera, including J.

They then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers.Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133\u201334 The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience: as critic Herman Klein wrote, \"we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings\u00a0.... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight.\"Jacobs, p. 113 Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought naturalism in acting, which was unusual at the time, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes.Cox-Ife, William.
