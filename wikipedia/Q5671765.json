He joined the Royal Navy in 1907, as a boy seaman with HMS Impregnable.\nDuring the First World War he served with the Dover Patrol and with the Grand Fleet; he took part in the Battle of Jutland aboard Revenge. In 1917 he was promoted to the rank of gunner and saw service in the Aegean aboard Forward; that October, he was second-in-command of a landing party from the Forward which successfully evacuated a Royal Naval Air Service station on Lesbos Island, for which he was commissioned and received a mention in dispatches.\nAfter the war he was posted to the Black Sea and around Turkey, and saw action in Somaliland and Mesopotamia. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1920. In 1926 he was posted to Benbow. He was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander in February 1928, and transferred to Vernon in April. In May 1929 he was appointed to Eagle and in March 1931 to Hood. He retired in 1936.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, he worked as a journalist in Spain.\nHe married first in 1921, then secondly in 1944 and was granted a decree nisi of divorce in 1956. He married again in September 1954, in New Jersey, to Baroness Huszar, a Hungarian. In 1954 his second wife was arrested in Montreal, for possessing counterfeit United States money, and acquitted after trial. He later won a lawsuit against her solicitor, who had argued that although he had conducted her defence without entering Canada, he was a licensed Canadian solicitor as well as an English one and thus not required to comply with English regulations. His wife was again, however, arrested in 1955, this time for the possession of narcotics; she was convicted, and they were divorced in 1959.He was elected as the Labour member of parliament for Kingston upon Hull East in the 1945 general election. In the 1951 general election, he held the seat with a majority of 11,500 votes, rising to 12,700 votes in 1955, 16,300 votes in 1964, and 23,000 in 1966. He announced in 1967 that he would resign at the next election, and was succeeded by John Prescott in the 1970 election.\nHe had a great interest in \"below-decks\" naval history, and spent his later years working on a history of the Invergordon Mutiny, though it does not appear to have been published. His obituary in The Times described him as \"the first naval officer promoted from the lower deck\" to enter Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Prescott", "response": ["Prescott returned to the National Union of Seamen as a full-time official before being elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull East in 1970, succeeding Commander Harry Pursey, the retiring Labour MP. The defeated Conservative challenger was Norman Lamont. Previously, he had attempted to become MP for Southport in 1966, but came in second place, approximately 9,500 votes behind the Conservative candidate. From July 1975 to 1979, he concurrently served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and Leader of the Labour Group, when its members were nominated by the national Parliaments. In 1988 Prescott and Eric Heffer challenged Roy Hattersley for the deputy leadership of the party, but Roy Hattersley was reelected as deputy leader. Prescott stood again in the 1992 deputy leadership election, following Hattersley's retirement, but lost to Margaret Beckett."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Harry Pursey"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Harry Pursey"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Cmdr.
