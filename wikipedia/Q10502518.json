With chances limited at West Ham, Morgan joined Portsmouth where he enjoyed to most success in his career. He spent five seasons at Fratton Park where he made 109 appearances scoring 35 goals. He joined Stoke City where he scored 26 goals in 104 games in four seasons before playing for Bristol City for four years.

Mills joined Stoke with the club a very poor position having just been relegated from the First Division with a record low points tally and with little money available. He sent about trying to restore some pride into the support and began well as Stoke beat Leeds United 6\u20132 on the third match of the 1985\u201386. Money was still a major problem so he sold Mark Chamberlain to Portsmouth for \u00a3300,000 but typical of the financial climate at Stoke the money was used to reduce the club's overdraft. Results slowly improved and Stoke finished the season in 10th place in what was a season of recovery. More player sales followed in 1986\u201387 but the arrival of Peter Coates as chairman allowed for some new players to arrive most notably Lee Dixon, Nicky Morgan and former Ipswich teammate Brian Talbot. Morale was boosted again thanks to another large win over Leeds United (7\u20132) as Stoke climbed up the table into the play-offs.
