Katie is desperate to impress him and decides to clean up the local river. She enlists the help of her friend Siobhan (Joanne Birchall) but when they begin cleaning, Katie falls into the polluted water. She is rushed to hospital where they she is diagnosed with a form of toxaemia. When producers decided to break-up the marriage of Frank (Peter Christian) and Chrissy Rogers (Eithne Brown), writers used the opportunity to impact Katie the most. Tibballs described it as \"Katie's greatest heartache\". On-screen Katie desperately wants her parents to remain together and she could not believe that her mother would leave her. Katie did not understand why they separate despite the Rogers' constant arguing. The decision to axe the character of Chrissy was made by Brookside's executive producer Mal Young. He was unhappy with the Rogers family dynamic and thought their stories were \"going round in circles\".Tibballs 1992, p.24. Young told Browne that she needed to leave to save the Rogers family from being axed entirely the following year. Young's research for the show found that there was an increasing number of families with children splitting up in the United Kingdom. He concluded that he wanted to reflect this scenario with the Rogers family. Writers then introduced Leanne Powell (Vickie Gates) as Katie's new friend. She begins to be a bad influence on Katie and used her to get close to Owen Daniels (Danny McCall) in her plan to seduce him. In the book Brookside The Early Years, Burke told author Tibballs that she \"thoroughly enjoyed\" playing Katie through her teenage years. She added \"despite everything she's been through, she's emerged as a kind, sensible girl.

Poppins was contracted with Brookside until September 2001 and admitted that he was unsure of what his status with the show would be beyond that date. Marquess later told Allison Maund from Inside Soap that he introduced Lance, alongside returning characters of Leanne Powell (Vickie Gates) and Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White) to work in Bev's Bar. He added that he felt Brookside needed a \"good bar with some great staff\". By November that year Poppins was still a part of the serial.
