He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who played for Northamptonshire.\nWolstenholme's debut in the Second XI came in May 2004, against Warwickshire, having made a List A appearance for Northamptonshire Cricket Board four years previously. He batted defensively and failed to score a run in the first innings, though he finished not out with a respectable score in the second.\nWolstenholme had to wait for just over a year before his first and only first-class appearance, against a team of touring Bangladeshis. Though Wolstenholme did not bat during the match, he bowled with a strong defensive streak, conceding just fourteen runs from nine overs. Wolstenholme was a tailend batsman for both the Second XI and first-class teams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Wolstenholme (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Wolstenholme is an English cricketer.", "John Wolstenholme may also refer to:", "*Sir John Wolstenholme, 1st Baronet (c. 1596\u20131670)", "*Sir John Wolstenholme, 3rd Baronet (1649\u20131709), MP for Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)"]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire Cricket Board List A players", "response": ["*John Wolstenholme, 1 match, 2000"]}, {"page": "Wolstenholme, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Wolstenholme"]}]}}
