The Guardian, in his obituary, called him \"one of the last survivors of the heroic age of archaeology\". As Director and Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society from 1945 until 1975, he helped organize the first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953.Born in Cork, Ireland, Kirwan matriculated at Merton College, Oxford in 1925, but left the following year before completing his degree. (He later returned to his studies, and was awarded a BLitt in 1935.) He served as assistant director of the Egyptian government's Archaeological Survey of Nubia from 1929 to 1934 and then as field director of Oxford University's expeditions to Nubia between 1934 and 1937. From 1937 until 1939 he held a fellowship at Edinburgh University and did fieldwork in the Sudan and Aden. With the onset of the Second World War, he became a reserve officer in the Territorial Army, but in 1942 he became a staff officer attached to the Ministry of Defence. After the war, Kirwan took the reins of the Royal Geographical Society. Concurrently from 1961 to 1981 he was President of the British Institute in Eastern Africa.In 1958, Kirwan was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), which was raised to Knight Commander in 1972. His first marriage, to Joan Chetwynd in 1932, ended in divorce. The couple had one daughter. In 1949, he married Stella Monck (she died in 1997). He died in a London hospice at the age of 91.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fellows of Imperial College London", "response": ["* Sir Laurence Kirwan"]}, {"page": "Laurence Kirwan", "response": ["Laurence Kirwan may refer to:"]}, {"page": "Sudan Archaeological Research Society", "response": ["The main SARS library is housed in the society's office in the Department of Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum in London. It also maintains a branch library within the office of the Section Fran\u00e7aise de la Direction des Antiquit\u00e9s du Soudan in the premises of the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (Sudan) in Khartoum. Both libraries are open for consultation by appointment. The core of the library is formed of books and offprints once belonging to the society's first president, Sir Laurence Kirwan, and to the late honorary president, Professor William Y. Adams. Amongst its most useful assets is a full run of Kush, the journal of the Sudan Antiquities Service, many volumes of Sudan Notes and Records and important publications on Sudanese history and archaeology."]}, {"page": "Kinaidokolpitai", "response": ["The first part of the name may relate to the later Arab tribe of Kinda, deliberately rendered in Greek in a pejorative form. Carlo Conti Rossini interpreted it as \"Kinda living on the shore of the gulf\". Hermann von Wissmann saw it as combining the names of the Kin\u0101na and Kalb tribes. Mikhail Bukharin, taking the first element as Kinda, thinks the second part could be either the Kalb or more likely the Kil\u0101b. Laurence Kirwan identifies them with the Kin\u0101na."]}]}}
