Henry was released by Tottenham in November 2003, and signed for Irish club Dublin City in August 2004. He was released four months later due to financial problems at the club. In January 2005, Henry joined Hertfordshire club Stevenage of the Conference National (fifth tier of the English football league system), initially until the end of the 2004\u201305 season. He remained at Stevenage and was made captain in 2005. Henry captained the Stevenage team that won the FA Trophy in the first competitive final at Wembley Stadium in May 2007; becoming the first player to lift a competitive trophy at the new stadium. He enjoyed more success at Stevenage in the following years; winning the FA Trophy in 2009, before helping the club earn successive promotions from the Conference Premier into League One.\nAfter seven years at Stevenage, Henry joined Luton Town of the Conference Premier in May 2012, where he was made club captain. In his second season at Luton, Henry was part of the team that won the Conference Premier title. He left Luton that summer, in order to rejoin Stevenage. He spent five further years at Stevenage, during which he became the club's all-time record appearance holder with 502 appearances.
