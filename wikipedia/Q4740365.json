The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was Douglas Bader, who played golf with Fleming on a number of occasions. The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on Amaryllis Fleming, Ian's half-sister, a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: \"Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl Amaryllis somebody.\""]}, {"page": "Lucy Fleming", "response": ["She was born in Nettlebed, England.
