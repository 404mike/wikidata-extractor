His book, Principles of Economics (1890), was the dominant economic textbook in England for many years. It brought the ideas of supply and demand, marginal utility, and costs of production into a coherent whole. He is known as one of the founders of neoclassical economics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adam Smith", "response": ["The body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"marginalism\" formed from about 1870 to 1910.

This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences.Clark, B. (1998). Political-economy: A comparative approach, 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 32. Neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.Campos, Antonietta (1987). \"Marginalist Economics\", The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 3, p. 320", "Alfred Marshall criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be held in equal importance to money, services in equal importance to goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate.

But insofar as they had had a concept of aggregate demand, they had seen the demand for investment as being given by S\u202f(Y\u202f), since for them saving was simply the indirect purchase of capital goods, with the result that aggregate demand was equal to total income as an identity rather than as an equilibrium condition.

Marshall's influence extended elsewhere; Italians would compliment Maffeo Pantaleoni by calling him the \"Marshall of Italy\".

He asserted that earlier marginalists went too far in correcting this imbalance by overemphasizing utility and demand. Marshall thought that \"We might as reasonably dispute whether it is the upper", "The thinking of the Cambridge school continued in the steps of classical political economics and its traditions but was based on the new approach that originated from the marginalist revolution. Its founder was Alfred Marshall, and among the main representatives were Arthur Cecil Pigou, Ralph George Hawtrey and Dennis Holme Robertson. Pigou worked on the theory of welfare economics and the quantity theory of money. Hawtrey and Robertson developed the Cambridge cash balance approach to theory of money and influenced the trade cycle theory. Until the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes was also influencing the theoretical concepts of the Cambridge school. The key characteristic of the Cambridge school was its instrumental approach to the economy \u2013 the role of the theoretical economist is first to define theoretical instruments of economic analysis and only just then apply them to real economic problems.SOJKA, M.
