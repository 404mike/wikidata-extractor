In his book Iron Coffins, former U-boat commander Herbert A. Werner states that the selection of naval personnel based on their loyalty to the party only occurred later in the war (from 1943 onward)  when the U-boats were suffering high casualties and when morale was declining. Such a degree of skepticism may or may not have occurred. In support of Das Boot on this subject, U-boat historian Michael Gannon maintains that the U-boat navy was one of the least pro-Nazi branches of the German armed forces."]}, {"page": "St. Augustine, Florida", "response": ["* Michael Gannon, historian"]}, {"page": "Ernest King", "response": ["Historian Michael Gannon blamed King for the heavy American losses during the Second Happy Time.
