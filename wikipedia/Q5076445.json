While John provided the enthusiasm and vigour that drove the Cooper company forward, it was Charles' shrewd business brain that provided the stability \u2013 and profitability \u2013 that laid the foundation for their sporting success. Regular works driver Jack Brabham won the World Drivers' Championship in both the 1959 and 1960 Formula One seasons driving the Coopers' revolutionary mid-engined cars, and the Cooper team itself took the World Constructors' Championships. Although they never again achieved the heights of a World Championship, the Coopers' innovative vehicles left a lasting influence on racing car design. Before 1959 all Formula One World Champions had driven front-engined cars; since 1959 no front-engined car has won the World Championship again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cooper Car Company", "response": ["The Cooper Car Company is a British car manufacturer founded in December 1947Wright, Terry; Power Without Glory: Racing the Big-twin Cooper, Loose Fillings Sydney 2015. See also www.loosefillings.com by Charles Cooper and his son John Cooper.  Together with John's boyhood friend, Eric Brandon, they began by building racing cars in Charles's small garage in Surbiton, Surrey, England, in 1946. Through the 1950s and early 1960s they reached motor racing's highest levels as their rear-engined, single-seat cars competed in both Formula One and the Indianapolis 500, and their Mini Cooper dominated rally racing.  The Cooper name lives on in the Cooper versions of the Mini production cars that are built in England, but is now owned and marketed by BMW.", "The little-known designer behind the car was Owen Maddock, who was employed by Cooper Car Company. Maddock was known as 'The Beard' by his workmates, and 'Whiskers' to Charles Cooper. Maddock was a familiar figure in the drivers' paddock of the 1950s in open-neck shirt and woolly jumper and a prime force behind the rise of British racing cars to their dominant position in the 1960s.", "Once every Formula car manufacturer began building rear-engined racers, the practicality and intelligent construction of Cooper's single-seaters was overtaken by more sophisticated technology from Lola, Lotus, BRM, and Ferrari. The Cooper team's decline was accelerated when John Cooper was seriously injured in a road accident in 1963 driving a twin-engined Mini, and Charles Cooper died in 1964."]}, {"page": "John Cooper (car maker)", "response": ["John Newton Cooper CBE (17 July 1923 \u2013 24 December 2000) was a co-founder, with his father Charles Cooper, of the Cooper Car Company.

His son John left school at age 15 to become an apprentice toolmaker and served in the Royal Air Force as an instrument maker in World War II. After the war, he and his father began building simple, inexpensive single-seat racers for privateers, often from surplus military hardware. The cars were extremely successful and quickly in high demand, and in 1948, they founded their own company to build more."]}, {"page": "Charles Cooper", "response": ["Charles Cooper may refer to:", "* Charles Cooper (judge) (1795\u20131887), first Chief Justice of South Australia, 1856\u20131861", "* Charles Cooper (cricketer) (1868\u20131943), English cricketer", "* Charles Cooper (motor manufacturer) (1893\u20131964), co-founder of the Cooper Car Company", "* Charles Cooper (actor) (1926\u20132013), television and movie actor"]}, {"page": "Owen Maddock", "response": ["Following unsuccessful approaches to HRD and Trojan,Nye (2003), p. 31 Maddock was taken on by the Cooper Car Company, run by father and son team Charles and John Cooper. Charles Cooper had been involved in motorsport since the 1920s, having acted as racing mechanic to Kaye Don for many years, and had built John a racing special as a twelfth birthday present in 1936. Working at the family garage in Surbiton, the pair constructed their first motorcycle-engined  racing car in 1946. A string of wins followed, raising the reputation of the Cooper 500 to such an extent that they were able to begin selling replicas to fellow competitors.", "Unusually for the time Maddock sported a full beard. As a result of this he quickly became known around the Cooper establishment as \"The Beard\", while to Charles Cooper he would always be \"Whiskers\". His mercurial temperament and volatile temper sometimes grated against his employers' nerves. Once, when a potential new recruit arrived for a job interview, Charles Cooper asked his secretary whether he had a beard. On being told that he did, Cooper told her to \"Send 'im home. I've got enough trouble with the one I've got!\".Nye (2003), p. 125.", " & Rodkwan (2004) Following proper engineering practice, when he started to develop plans for the new chassis design Maddock sketched out various straight-tubed space frame designs. However, when he showed each to Charlie Cooper his response was \"Nah, Whiskers, that's not it...\" Frustrated, Maddock finally went away and drew a frame in which every tube was bent. To his surprise, rather than dismissing it Cooper's reaction was to snatch the plans out of Maddock's hands and exclaim \"That's it...\" Although the curved tube design broke several engineering rules Maddock and the Coopers later rationalised their decision. Their arguments were that curved tubes could be located and routed so as to leave adequate space for mechanical components, and as the tubes could be run close under the car's bodywork this could be attached directly to the frame, saving the weight and complexity of a dedicated bodywork frame. Although the idea started as a joke Maddock would later defend the design, even in the teeth of strong criticism from Cooper's star driver Jack Brabham. Brabham would come to recall that Maddock was latterly an even more staunch defender of the curved-tube concept than Charles Cooper."]}, {"page": "Charles Cooper (motor racing)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Cooper (motor manufacturer)"]}, {"page": "Charlie Cooper", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Cooper (motor manufacturer)"]}]}}
