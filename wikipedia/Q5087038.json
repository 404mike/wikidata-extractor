Other props included knives and daggers, skulls and \"bodies\". Sutch booked themed tours, such as 'Sutch and the Roman Empire', where Sutch and the band members would be dressed up as Roman soldiers. Fellow musician Chas McDevitt has claimed that he gave the idea for a Screamin' Jay Hawkins-inspired act to Sutch's manager Paul Lincoln after seeing Hawkins perform in New York in 1957, having already considered emulating Hawkins himself by starting his act by emerging from a silk-lined coffin but deciding that he \"(didn't have) the personality to carry this off\", stating that \"no one in this country had heard of Hawkins until the mid-60s\"."]}, {"page": "Rod Stewart", "response": ["The family were also great fans of the singer Al Jolson and would sing and play his hits.Nelson and Bangs, Rod Stewart, p. 54.

Skiffle was a major part of the early careers of some musicians who later became prominent jazz, pop, blues, folk, and rock performers, The Beatles and Rory Gallagher amongst them. It has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, the British blues boom, and the British Invasion of American popular music.", "It was the success of this single and the lack of a need for expensive instruments or high levels of musicianship that set off the British skiffle craze. A few bands enjoyed chart success in the skiffle craze, including the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group (\"Freight Train\"), Chas McDevitt: Skiffle Johnny Duncan and the Bluegrass Boys, and the Vipers, but the main impact of skiffle was as a grassroots amateur movement, particularly popular among working class males, who could cheaply buy, improvise, or build their own instruments and who have been seen as reacting against the drab austerity of post-war Britain.J. P. Ward, Britain and the American South: From Colonialism to Rock and Roll (University Press of Mississippi, 2009), pp. 192\u20136.
