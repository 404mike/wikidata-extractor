He is most notable for his roles in the Comic Strip Presents.. and in other British comedy films.\nHe had a long spell as a musician in the Royal Marines between 1940 and 1960. During this time, he is reported to have been accused of mutiny on two occasions. On both occasions, however, he was excused from any punishment; it is believed due to his charm and wit as a comedian.\nDuring his time as a marine Fagg forged a career as a stand-up comedy actor, performing in the traditional pub circuit of musicians. He performed in a number of pubs in the East End of London throughout this time. He became most popular as a weekend performer at The Imperial Crown pub, performing every Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. His talent as a pianist was often at the core of his performances. Both his talent as a musician and as a comedian were honed during his time in the band of the Royal Marines.\nWhile performing in the early 1980s, his talent as a comic was spotted by the then newly formed Comic Strip. He appeared on a number of the features produced by them including; The Bullshitters: South Atlantic Raiders: Part 2 Argie Bargie!, GLC: The Carnage Continues, Oxford, Spaghetti Hoops, Les Dogs, The Crying Game, Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown, Space Virgins from Planet Sex, Queen of the Wild Frontier.\nAs well as the films produced as part of the Comic Strip Presents... series, he also appeared in a number of feature films; Walter (1982), Eat the Rich (1987) and The Imitators (1996).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bullshitters: Roll Out the Gunbarrel", "response": ["*Jimmy Fagg as Himself "]}, {"page": "Eat the Rich (film)", "response": ["The film stars Lanah Pellay as Alex, Nosher Powell as the Home Secretary, and a number of cameos, including by: Miranda Richardson, Nigel Planer, Robbie Coltrane, Rik Mayall, Paul McCartney, Shane MacGowan, Jennifer Saunders, Jimmy Fagg, Kathy Burke, Koo Stark, Dawn French, Bill Wyman, Jools Holland, Hugh Cornwell, Adrian Edmondson, Angela Bowie, and Lemmy.", "* Jimmy Fagg as Jimmy"]}, {"page": "Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown", "response": ["* Jimmy Fagg as East End drinker landlord"]}, {"page": "Fagg (surname)", "response": ["*Jimmy Fagg (born 1929), English stand-up comedian, musician and actor"]}]}}
