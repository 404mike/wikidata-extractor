Three of her children also wrote poetry: Arthur (1850-1895), Fanny (1852-1889), and Mary (b. 1857). Forrester was a committed nationalist, and helped Caroline Douglas raise money for the defence fund for the Manchester Martyrs. Her son Arthur joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1866 and was a leading Lancashire Fenian. She sought help from her friend, Michael Davitt, when Arthur was arrested in 1869. During Davitt's own imprisonment in Millbank penitentiary, he requested permission for Forrester to visit him but this was denied as she was deemed to be a \"notorious Fenian-sympathiser.\""]}]}}
