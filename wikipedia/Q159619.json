This second building boom continued the futuristic trend, but emphasized a much more colorful, postmodern approach that somewhat contradicted the earthy, organic designs of the early buildings. Architects such as Frank Gehry, Robert Venturi, Eric Owen Moss, James Stirling and Arthur Erickson were brought in to bring the campus more up to date. The recession in the early 1990s along with internal politics led to a change in direction, due to the reduced capital budget, and changing attitudes towards architectural innovation at the university. This, in turn, led to a \"contextualist\" approach beginning in the late 1990s combining stylistic elements of the first two phases in an attempt to provide an architectural \"middle ground\" between the two vastly different styles. Gehry's building was recently removed from campus to make way for a new building, with a design that has been called a \"big beige box with bands of bricks\". In 2009 the Humanities Gateway building, designed by Curtis W. Fentress, was opened.

The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms.  The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects Robert A. M.

While his apathy towards the recent \"green\" movement is considered polarizing or \"out-of-touch\", this architect-artist (with drawings held by major collections) was also an early advocate of computer-aided design.  Eisenman employed fledgling innovators such as Greg Lynn and Ingeborg Rocker as early as 1989. Despite these claims of polarity and autonomization, Eisenman has famously pursued dialogues with important cultural figures internationally.

If \"the presence of the past\" was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th century, from James Stirling to Aldo Rossi, Robert Venturi, Oswald Matthias Ungers, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. Colin Rowe's unorthodox and non-chronological view of history then made it possible for him to develop theoretical formulations such as his famous essay \"The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa\" (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional \"rules\" in Palladio's villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar \"rules\" in Le Corbusier's villas at Poissy and Garches.The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa and Other Essays, MIT Press, Main essay reprinted in collected works volume, (1976).
