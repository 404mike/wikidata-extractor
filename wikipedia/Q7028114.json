He was a right-handed batsman and his bowling style was right arm fast-medium. He was born in Moseley, Birmingham.\nHe was said to have shown potential in the England Under 17 team against Ireland in 1999, and he went on to tour Malaysia with the Under 19's, and played in the Youth World Cup in Sri Lanka during 1999\u20132000. While in the England A cricket team, his Youth Test debut came in 2002 against West Indies A.\nHowever, Warren's career appeared to be on the verge of decline when his contract at Warwickshire was ended in 2003 and, during his fight to keep his place, he missed three months of play due to a stress-fracture of the spine in 2004. However a run 'of impressive performances' earned him a renewal on his contract, where he played Northamptonshire in the Frizzell County Championship, taking three wickets for one run in ten balls.Warren did not hold down his place, however, and did not appear for the first team after the 2005 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["20px|English Nick Warren", "In the local battle at New Road, Worcestershire Royals eked out a victory over rivals Warwickshire Bears. Graeme Hick and Ben Smith both made big scores, with 67 and 47, and skipper Gareth Batty also made 21 to send Worcestershire to 177 for 7. Warwickshire then collapsed to accurate bowling, losing their entire top order except Jonathan Trott to end up on 68 for 5 \u2013 but Michael Powell made 40 not out batting at seven, turning the innings almost back to Warwickshire's favour. In the end, however, they were two runs short, their No. 11 Nick Warren only managing to hit one off the two balls he faced."]}, {"page": "Kent County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["On a fourth-day pitch favouring the spinners, Warwickshire found themselves in deep trouble on 73 for 5. If Kent were to finish champions, they really should have won from that position, but Tony Frost and Alex Loudon had different ideas when they batted throughout the whole afternoon session. After tea, Patel took three quick wickets, and Kent again looked on course for the win. But Frost, who scored 82, survived throughout the entire evening session, and after the ninth wicket fell, last man Nick Warren survived for 15 balls to earn Warwickshire the draw. They were 233 for 9 at stumps. (BBC scorecard)", "Warwickshire felt the loss of seamer Heath Streak to injury as they went down by a massive margin to a strong Kent side at Maidstone. Batting first, Warwickshire were 116 for 8 when Tony Frost departed for 23, Simon Cook and Amjad Khan having taken three wickets each. However, a ninth-wicket partnership of 97 between Streak and Neil Carter, along with a level-headed stand from the number 11 Nick Warren lifted Warwickshire to 252. As it turned out, it was nowhere near enough. Streak limped off in his fifth over with a groin injury, leaving all-rounder Alex Loudon and Carter to do the brunt of the bowling, and they were woefully ineffective against Kent's batting line-up. Matthew Walker and Darren Stevens both made centuries for Kent, Martin van Jaarsveld chipped in with 62, while Loudon was Warwickshire's best bowler with three for 130, Kent amassed 569 \u2013 a lead of 317 runs. In the twenty overs remaining on the third day, Andrew Hall dug out two wickets for Kent, including England Test batsman Ian Bell for a duck. On a fourth-day pitch which turned plenty, Min Patel could take six for 53, as Warwickshire crumbled in a woeful heap for 153."]}, {"page": "Nick Warren", "response": ["In 1988, Nick Warren began DJing in Bristol, playing mainly reggae and indie music until house music became more popular in the UK.
