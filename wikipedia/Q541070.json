He apprenticed briefly to become a solicitor and worked briefly as a partner in a firm but gave up a career in law for his interests. In his spare time he studied Anglo-Saxon and medieval manuscripts and earned a living by illustrating and writing. His early works included reproductions of old manuscripts and illuminations. It was in 1824 that he met the entomologist Reverend Frederick William Hope for the first time and they were close friends. In 1833 Westwood and Hope were founding members of the Entomological Society of London and Westwood served as its secretary in 1834. In the same year, Hope had his insect collections organized by Westwood. This allowed Westwood to examine and describe insects from around the world.
