In this book, the Rutans had learned of the Sontarans' attack on Earth in the 21st century, and had planted a cloud of spores into Saturn's atmosphere. These spores were originally intended to infect the Sontarans, after they had taken over Earth and expanded to the rest of the Solar System - however, due to the intervention of the Doctor, the Sontarans were defeated, and humans instead reached Saturn a number of centuries later, and were infected themselves when they breathed in the spores. These spores allegedly contained Rutans, allowing them to take over the host (though the host itself remains alive). Their appearance led to the attack of the Sontarans on Chelsea 426. The Rutans were eventually defeated by the Doctor, but had by that time infected a number of the Sontarans as well. The Sontarans then headed back to Sontaran space, unknowing that they were carrying Rutans into their territory."]}, {"page": "Richard Armitage (actor)", "response": ["|Lisa McMullin, Lou Morgan, David Llewellyn & Matt Fitton "]}, {"page": "Torchwood", "response": ["On 3 May 2015, it was announced that Big Finish Productions would produce a series of six Torchwood audio adventures starring John Barrowman as Jack.
