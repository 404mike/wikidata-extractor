His library was bought by Henry Tibbats Stainton (1822\u20131892) who continued to keep Stephen's tradition of keeping the books available to other entomologists on Wednesday evenings.

At this time, he became associated with the English scientific establishment through his father's friendship with Henry Tibbats Stainton.

Zeller's precise, orderly approach culminated in the most significant lepidopterological work of the nineteenth century \u2013 The Natural History of the Tineina. This, a monumental 13-volume monograph, was commenced in 1855 and completed in 1873. The other main authors were the Englishman Henry Tibbats Stainton, a Swiss, Heinrich Frey and another Englishman, John William Douglas. The Natural History of the Tineina appeared in English, French, German and Latin editions, the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday doing the bulk of the translations.

His father came from Edinburgh. In a schoolboy prank gone wrong, a fellow student dropped a match into his pocket which contained crackers resulting in serious injury to his leg. Two years largely confined in bed forced him to take up botanical drawing and when he was able to walk again took up work at Kew as a botanical illustrator. He became interested in insects whilst working at Kew Gardens and published many papers and books on entomology. His most important work was The Natural History of the Tineina with the German Philipp Christoph Zeller, Englishman Henry Tibbats Stainton and a Swiss, Heinrich Frey. The Natural History of the Tineina appeared in English, French, German and Latin editions. Although his main interest was the Lepidoptera, Douglas was joint author of the work British Hemiptera Vol.1. Hemiptera-Heteroptera (1865). He was a president of the Royal Entomological Society (1860\u201361) and editor of The Entomologist's Monthly Magazine. Douglas was a keen promoter of entomology, especially among the young.

Westwood left his functions in 1848 and was replaced by Edward Doubleday (1810\u20131849) and William Frederick Evans. They in their turn were soon replaced.
