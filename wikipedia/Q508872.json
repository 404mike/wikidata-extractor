Wyllie FMedSci FRS is a Scottish pathologist. In 1972, while working with electron microscopes at the University of Aberdeen he realised the significance of natural cell death. He and his colleagues John Kerr and Alastair Currie called this process apoptosis, from the use of this word in an ancient Greek poem to mean \"falling off\" (like leaves falling from a tree). He completed postdoctoral training in Cambridge and became Professor of Experimental Pathology at the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1992. He left Edinburgh for Cambridge in 1998 His works have contributed to the understanding of apoptosis in health and in disease, and he continues to lecture to undergraduate medical and natural sciences students in Cambridge.After retirement, Wyllie was succeeded in his role as Head of the Department of Pathology at Cambridge by Geoffrey L. Smith in October 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Apoptosis", "response": ["German scientist Carl Vogt was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist Walther Flemming delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Kerr at the University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death. Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair Currie, as well as Andrew Wyllie, who was Currie's graduate student, at University of Aberdeen. In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the British Journal of Cancer. Kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis, but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called apoptosis. Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at University of Aberdeen, with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist H.
