Smyth (1 July 1942 \u2013 16 October 2016) was an Irish-born historian specialising in the mediaeval history of the British Isles. In 2002 he was named Dean of Arts and Humanities at Canterbury Christ Church University College, having been Director of Research there since 1999. He was also Warden of St. George's House, Windsor Castle. Earlier, he was Professor of Mediaeval History at the University of Kent, when he was Master of Keynes College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "\u00c6thelwulf, King of Wessex", "response": ["Some scholars, for example Frank Stenton, author of the standard history of Anglo-Saxon England, along with Keynes and Abels, see the Second Decimation as a donation of royal demesne. In Abels' view \u00c6thelwulf sought loyalty from the aristocracy and church during the king's forthcoming absence from Wessex, and displayed a sense of dynastic insecurity also evident in his father's generosity towards the Kentish church in 838, and in an \"avid attention\" in this period to compiling and revising royal genealogies. Keynes suggests that \"\u00c6thelwulf's purpose was presumably to earn divine assistance in his struggles against the Vikings\", and the mid-20th-century historian Eric John observes that \"a lifetime of medieval studies teaches one that an early medieval king was never so political as when he was on his knees\". The view that the decimation was a donation of the king's own personal estate is supported by the Anglo-Saxonist Alfred P. Smyth, who argues that these were the only lands the king was entitled to alienate by book. The historian Martin Ryan prefers the view that \u00c6thelwulf freed a tenth part of land owned by laymen from secular obligations, who could now endow churches under their own patronage. Ryan sees it as part of a campaign of religious devotion. According to the historian David Pratt, it \"is best interpreted as a strategic 'tax cut', designed to encourage cooperation in defensive measures through a partial remission of royal dues\". Nelson states that the decimation took place in two phases, in Wessex in 854 and Kent in 855, reflecting that they remained separate kingdoms."]}, {"page": "Constantine III of Scotland", "response": ["During the 10th century, there were dynastic conflicts in Scotland between two rival lines of royalty. One descended from Causant\u00edn mac Cin\u00e1eda (Constantine I, reigned 862\u2013877), the other from his brother \u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda (reigned 877\u2013878).  Constantine III belonged to the second line. His royal ancestors included \u00c1ed himself, Constantine II of Scotland (reigned 900\u2013943), Indulf (reigned 954\u2013962), and Cuil\u00e9n (reigned 967\u2013971).  Amla\u00edb of Scotland (reigned 973\u2013977) was his paternal uncle.Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 223-224 The alternation between the two royal lines seems to have been peaceful for a long time; Alfred P. Smyth regards this early phase as  \"a century of kingly coexistence\". The armed conflict between the lines seems to have started in the 960s, when Cuil\u00e9n challenged the rule of his cousin Dub, King of Scotland (962-967). The initial motivation behind the conflict is unclear. Smyth speculates that control over the Kingdom of Strathclyde might have been a major factor."]}, {"page": "Giric", "response": ["* Alfred P.

Alfred P. Smyth suggests that the Chronicle's account reflects bias in Alfred's favour, and that \u00c6thelred took charge because he had a greater role in London's recovery than the West Saxon chronicler was willing to admit.Smyth, King Alfred the Great, p. 519 Some versions of the Chronicle state that Alfred besieged London in 883, and Simon Keynes argues that Alfred probably took London at that time and that the \"occupation\" in 886 may have been a restoration of London's defences following Viking attacks close to the city in 885.Keynes, \"King Alfred and the Mercians\", pp.\u00a021\u201324"]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelwold \u00e6theling", "response": ["After King \u00c6thelred's death in 871, his sons' supporters complained about Alfred keeping property that should have belonged to his nephews.

According to the Harleian genealogies, he was the son of Guipno map Dumnagual Hen. Alfred Smyth suggests he is the same man as King Nechtan the Great of the Picts, and perhaps the Nechtan son of Canu the Annals of Ulster record as having died in 621.Alfred P. Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men, (Edinburgh, 1984), pp. 64-5.The Annals of Ulster 621.3.

However, it is possible that either as an Alt Clut Briton ascending the throne of Pictland, or as a Pict ascending the throne of Alt Clut, his genealogy might have been altered, and it is notable that in the Pictish king-lists he is called \"Nechtan, nepos Uerb\", suggesting that it was a descent from Uerb that mattered in Pictland, and not his unimportant father Guipno/Canu. Alan Orr Anderson pointed out that Uerb is probably the Pictish form of Ferb (genitive Feirbe), a female name.Alan Orr Anderson, Early Sources of Scottish History: AD 500\u20131286, 2 Vols, (Edinburgh, 1922), vol i., pp. 122, 145 Alan MacQuarrie suggests that Neithon was indeed the Pictish king Nechtan, but does not take any stance on the Guipno/Canu problem.Alan MacQuarrie,  \"The Kings of Strathclyde\", in A.

However, this identification would cause serious incongruities in the dating of the other kings of Alt Clut, as Neithon was the grandfather of Eugein I and is thought to have died around 620.MacQuarrie, p. 8, 10. Scholars such as Alfred P. Smyth suggest two Elfins, one the son of Eugein and one the son of Neithon.Smyth, pp. 64\u201365. However, Alan MacQuarrie suggests that there was one Elfin, but that the Annals of Ulster have substituted the name of his great-grandfather Neithon for his father Eugein, an error perhaps reflecting importance attached to descent from Neithon."]}]}}
