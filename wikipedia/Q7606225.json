Jackson decided to bring Michael O'Connor in on loan from Crewe Alexandra.

The club had been unable to do a deal to sign Parkin permanently from Chelsea and sent out an SOS for a striker which was even advertised on teletext. Northern Irish front man Roy Essandoh answered the call and made his debut in 1\u20130 defeat at home to Port Vale. A week later 3,202 Chairboys and girls made the journey up to Leicestershire and saw Manchester United loanee George Clegg and Wanderers legend Keith Ryan lead the attack against the Foxes. After a goalless first half Paul McCarthy scored his fifth FA Cup goal, diving in to head home Steve Brown's free-kick from close range. The dream appeared to have been dashed when Muzzy Izzet finished off a fine move to equalise twenty minutes later but the underdogs brushed off that disappointment and after Robbie Savage had to be substituted through injury and Essandoh replaced Ryan they seized the initiative in the final ten minutes and looked to have a good penalty shout turned down after Stefan Oakes appeared to handle in the area. Lawrie Sanchez was incensed and walked out of his technical area and down the touchline to remonstrate with the linesman. As the game went into injury-time Bulman swung in a cross to far post where Bates headed the ball back for Essandoh to leap like the proverbial salmon and head powerfully past Royce into the top corner. It was a sensational moment and although referee Steve Bennett played the role of spoilsport by showing Steve Brown a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration, there was little time for Leicester to come back and he blew the final whistle to confirm one of the biggest shocks in the competition's history. It sparked wild scenes of elation and disbelief as Wycombe Wanderers, a Football League club for less than eight years, were through to the semi-finals of the FA Cup."]}]}}
