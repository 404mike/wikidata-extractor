He played jazz in London in the late 1960s while taking lessons on the tabla from P.R. Desai. In 1969 he began experimenting with free improvisational music, working in a duo with saxophonist Evan Parker. After adding bassist Barry Guy, the ensemble became the Evan Parker Trio. He and Parker continued to work together into the 2000s; more recent releases include trio releases with Marilyn Crispell in 1996 (Natives and Aliens) and 1999 (After Appleby).\nA founding member of the London Musicians Collective, Lytton worked extensively on the London free improvisation scene in the 1970s, and aided Paul Lovens in the foundation of the Aachen Musicians' Cooperative in 1976.\nLytton has toured North America and Japan both solo and with improvisational ensembles. In 1999, he toured with Ken Vandermark and Kent Kessler, and recorded with Vandermark on English Suites.  Lytton also collaborated with Jeffrey Morgan (alto & tenor saxophone), with whom he recorded the CD \"Terra Incognita\" Live in Cologne, Germany.\nHe played also on White Noise's pioneer electronic pop music album An Electric Storm in 1969.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Incus Records", "response": ["|, Paul Lytton", "|, Paul Lytton", "|, Paul Burwell, Hugh Davies, Max Eastley, Paul Lovens, Paul Lytton, Annabel Nicolson, Evan Parker", "| & George Lewis/Maarten Altena & Derek Bailey/Barry Guy, Paul Lovens, Paul Lytton, Evan Parker & Phil Wachsmann/Maarten Altena, Barry Guy, George Lewis, Paul Rutherford & Giancarlo Schiaffini", "|, Barry Guy, Paul Lytton", "|, George Lewis, Barry Guy, Paul Lytton"]}, {"page": "Ikue Mori", "response": ["* The Nows (Paul Lytton/Nate Wooley + Ikue Mori/Ken Vandermark; Clean Feed, 2012)"]}, {"page": "Spring Heel Jack", "response": ["* Live in Antwerp (2014) with Pat Thomas, Alex Ward, Paul Lytton"]}, {"page": "Evan Parker", "response": ["Working with electronic music since the early days of the Spontaneous Music Ensemble or with his duo with Paul Lytton, Parker has become increasingly interested in electronics, usually through inviting collaborators such as Phil Wachsmann, Walter Prati, Joel Ryan, Lawrence Casserley, Sam Pluta or Matthew Wright to process his playing electronically, creating a feedback loop and shifting soundscape.
