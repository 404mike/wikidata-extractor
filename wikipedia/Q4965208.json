Olejnik came with a fine pedigree having played for Falkirk in the Scottish Premier League while Saah had previously played under Ling at Leyton Orient and Cambridge United.  With Chris Zebroski making the decision to follow former manager Paul Buckle to Bristol Rovers, Ling needed to improve his attacking options which led to the signings of strikers Rene Howe and Taiwo Atieno and midfielder Ian Morris. Finally, as back-up to Bobby Olejnik, former Gulls keeper Martin Rice returned to Plainmoor after two seasons with Truro City.", "With Rene Howe suffering from a hamstring injury and Billy Bodin on international duty with the Wales under-21 squad, Martin Ling was presented with a mini striker crisis before the visit of Macclesfield Town for the first fixture of the month. Despite this, Torquay managed to register their biggest win of the campaign so far with a 3\u20130 defeat of the Silkmen thanks to first goals of the season from Brian Saah, Chris McPhee and Eunan O'Kane.  Howe was fit enough to be restored to the starting line-up alongside Bodin for the next match which, ironically, resulted in a lacklustre 0\u20130 draw with Northampton Town at the Sixfields Stadium.  This was then followed up by two further draws against Cheltenham Town and Rotherham United, both at Plainmoor.  Although these were far more entertaining matches than the Northampton stalemate, it was concerning that Torquay had fallen behind within the first five minutes of both games.  However, the Gulls did at least show the desire to fight back in both games, gaining a 2\u20132 result against Cheltenham and finishing the epic Rotherham encounter with a 3\u20133 scoreline.  Nevertheless, Martin Ling was now growing concerned at the prospect of Torquay becoming the League's 'draw specialists'.", "While the Chesterfield match saw the earlier than expected return from injury of Ian Morris, the Gulls' next League encounter resulted in another long-term injury with defender Brian Saah picking up a serious tear to his groin. Although there was a ready-made replacement in Chris Robertson (who had recently lost his place in the team to Mark Ellis), the possible length of Saah's absence prompted Martin Ling to bring in young Colchester United defender Tom Aldred as cover until January. However, Saah's injury was probably the only negative point to a game which saw Torquay achieve their first League win over Devon rivals Plymouth Argyle since 1972.  A stunning second half brace from Eunan O'Kane helped the Gulls record a 3\u20131 victory over a Pilgrims side who were languishing at the bottom of League Two having only just been relegated from League One the previous season.", "Torquay got the New Year off to a flying start with a 2\u20131 victory over Plymouth Argyle.  It was the first time the Gulls had completed the League double over their Devon neighbours for over 40 years and their first win of any description at Home Park since January 2000.  The scoring was opened by Billy Bodin and it was to be his last contribution to the Gulls before he returned to Swindon Town following the completion of his loan deal.  Despite Martin Ling's best efforts, Robins boss Paolo Di Canio was reluctant to let Bodin return to Plainmoor, particularly with Torquay's recent good form making them potential rivals in the promotion race. With Brian Saah coming back to full fitness, defender Tom Aldred also returned to his parent club without making an appearance for the Gulls while Ed Palmer, Ray Spear and Lloyd Macklin all returned to Torquay following their loan spells at Truro, Bideford and Salisbury City respectively.", "With the squad now missing Chris Robertson and Billy Bodin, Martin Ling sought to bring in replacements for the departed pair.  First in was former Wales under-21 winger Nathan Craig.  Currently a free agent, Craig had impressed Ling while playing for the reserves and was offered what amounted to an extended trial until the end of the season. Another new face arrived in the shape of defender Angus MacDonald who was brought in on loan from Reading for the rest of the season. The new players had yet to make an appearance before Torquay's run of good form came to a shuddering halt with a surprise 2\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor to struggling Bradford City.  Fans may well have been wondering if they were feeling the delayed effects of the Manager of the Month 'curse' when the Gulls suffered a second successive loss away to Gillingham.  The 2\u20130 defeat at Priestfield ended in bizarre circumstances with the assistant referee flagging for a penalty when Brian Saah had seemingly brought down former Gulls-loanee Gavin Tomlin in the penalty box.  However, referee Jock Waugh (who had originally waved play-on) decided to send off Joe Oastler instead of Saah.  However, following an appeal, the FA rectified the error and the one-match ban was switched from Oastler to Saah.", "With a daunting eight fixtures scheduled for the month, Martin Ling endeavoured to strengthen the squad with the signing of Ryan Jarvis on loan from League One Walsall.  Jarvis had previously played under Ling at Leyton Orient but had recently failed to cement a regular place in the Saddlers' first team and so was allowed to the join the Gulls until the end of the season. Jarvis made his Torquay debut when he came on as a sub for the injured Danny Stevens in the month's first fixture, a tricky tie away to Crawley Town.  Also making his debut for the Gulls was Angus MacDonald who came in for the suspended Brian Saah.  The young defender gave an assured performance in his first ever League appearance to help Torquay gain a 1\u20130 victory over their promotion-chasing rivals.  It was a particularly satisfying result for the Torquay fans after August's humiliating 3\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor and the previous season's FA Cup exit.", "|= || DF ||  || 6 || Brian Saah || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|6 ||  || DF || Brian Saah || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0", "|Brian Saah"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The team got off to a solid start in August, recording wins over a poor Barnet side and a much more resilient Morecambe.

Only a bizarre own goal from Brian Saah won them a point at home to Torquay United, before Tom Pope hit four against former club Rotherham United in a 6\u20132 victory; the win over Steve Evans's big spending \"Millers\" sent a message to the rest of the division that Vale were genuine promotion candidates. They then came from behind to win away at Plymouth Argyle, before putting a highly impressive Fleetwood Town to the sword with a 5\u20132 away victory.
