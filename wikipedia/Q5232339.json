His father worked as a sales representative.   His schooling took him to the \"Realgymnasium\" which in the eyes of British historian David Childs made him a \"grammar school boy\".   His family background was evidently an intellectual one:  a source mentions his father's large private library.  The family adhered to the liberal branch of Judaism and he became a Bar Mitzvah. A year later he horrified his parents by renouncing religion. Two years after that (and less than a year before the Nazi take-over), influenced by his brother Rudolf, he joined the Young Communists."]}]}}
