Off it, the Annual General Meeting of the club, held at Jenkins Street Board School in July 1892, heard that \"skilful management, good matches, and capital 'gates had combined to produce a statement of financial affairs \"distinctly creditable to managers and players\", and the directors were to be congratulated. The club's application for election to the Football League First Division when it was expanded to 16 clubs was unsuccessful, but it was one of 12 clubs, mostly from the previous season's Football Alliance, elected to compete in the inaugural season of that league's Second Division. Alfred Jones had been acting as club secretary on a voluntary basis since 1885, when payment of players was first permitted.

Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, and the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies.

Walsall equalised with a scrappy goal from a corner, and attempted to impose themselves on the game, but the visitors' combination play held them at bay. Small Heath regained the lead when Walsall defender Alf Pinches headed into his own goal under pressure in a crowded goalmouth. In the second half, team captain Caesar Jenkyns increased the visitors' lead following a corner, and as the players of both sides tired, the play became disjointed, both goalkeepers had several saves to make, and a Walsall goal was disallowed for offside.", "Because of other teams' FA Cup engagements, Small Heath played only twice in the League during November. A comfortable victory by four goals to one at Bootle on 5 November took them to the top of the table, one point clear of Ardwick who lost at Grimsby. Their next game was less straightforward. At home to Burton Swifts, the visitors' superior finishing gave them a 2\u20130 lead at half-time; the second half was quite the opposite. Mobley scored from a Hallam cross after ten minutes, \"shot after shot was sent in to the Burton goal\", and eventually, with ten minutes left, Walton headed home the equaliser.

He praised the players' esprit de corps and pluck which had taken them to the top of the division, and encouraged them to resist the temptation to sign for other clubs, insisting that \"whatever money [the club] made after providing things of necessity would come to the players and\u00a0... the club could do as well for its players, if they only clung together, as any club in the country\". In reply, captain Caesar Jenkyns agreed that the players' efforts meant they \"deserved all the praise that had been bestowed on them\", and promised they would do their utmost to beat First Division club Burnley the following week in the FA Cup.", "Chris Charsley became the first Small Heath player to play for England, and only the second, after Caesar Jenkyns for Wales, to represent his country at full international level,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 246\u201347. when he took the field against Ireland on 27 February at Aston Villa's ground in Perry Barr, Birmingham.

A visit to Liverpool gave Caesar Jenkyns the honour of scoring the first Football League goal conceded by the home side, but the visitors \"fell all to pieces\" in the second half, and were decisively beaten. The young and inexperienced Smith made mistakes that cost two goals, but the forwards \"were undoubtedly the weak spot\", and the Birmingham Daily Post's reporter suggested they would \"have to learn to shoot harder and play with far more spirit if they are to keep up the reputation they gained last season\". After Burslem Port Vale \"beat Small Heath on Monday in more decided a fashion than did Liverpool\", by five goals to nil, the poor form shown in the previous two matches by the forwards, and by Wheldon in particular, was much improved at Ardwick.

After the referee rejected the Liverpool players' claim that Small Heath's equaliser had entered the goal through a hole in the side netting, their play became rough, culminating in centre-half Joe McQue, a \"strapping fellow\", kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen, apparently intentionally. While the referee was cautioning McQue, Small Heath captain Caesar Jenkyns rushed in, knocked McQue to the ground, and was sent off. With a man advantage, it still took Liverpool until the stroke of time to score the winning goal. The Post's reporter suggested that, despite the provocation, Jenkyns should not have reacted the way he did, but \"the knowledge that it cost his side the game\" was sufficient punishment. Despite the referee in his report agreeing that \"the punishment of being sent off would meet case\", and that Jenkyns had \"played a perfectly fair game\" and had expressed regret at his actions, both when dismissed and after the game, the Football Association imposed a four-week suspension, to begin on 31 October.", "Small Heath went through the League season without drawing a match. They scored 103 goals, at a rate of 3.6\u00a0goals per game, and became the first team to exceed 100 goals in a Football League season (Sunderland scored exactly 100 the previous season). If test match goals are counted, all five first-choice forwards reached double figures for the second consecutive season.

The Birmingham Daily Post picked out Hallam and Caesar Jenkyns for praise, was disappointed by Fred Wheldon, \"usually the bright particular star of the front rank\", and suggested that Jack Oliver would be a success \"when he has lost a little superfluous flesh\".", "After Wolverhampton Wanderers took a three-goal lead at Coventry Road, the Daily Post suggested that Caesar Jenkyns must have spent the interval \"exhorting his men to make a famous effort\", for \"they responded nobly to his appeal\". Adopting a strategy of all-out attack, running the ball upfield at full speed before crossing to as many of the forwards as could converge on goal, they scored four times in 25\u00a0minutes to demoralise the opposition and win the match. The quality of Hands' movement and crosses was singled out for particular praise.

Charlie Letherbarrow, in only his second appearance for the club, scored after ten minutes and again approaching the interval to regain the lead. Between the two legitimate scores, he hit a swerving shot which looped up off the chest of goalkeeper William Foulke and into the net, but the referee judged that the ball had been played in from behind the goal-line. In the second half, Wheldon converted a penalty kick when Foulke pushed Hallam out of the way as he attempted to reach a cross from Tommy Hands, and Letherbarrow completed his hat-trick as Small Heath won 4\u20131.

At Liverpool, an exciting game produced a 3\u20131 defeat. The three home forwards worked as one, putting extra pressure on the centre of the visiting midfield, and the defence was unable to hold them out.

This time round, Small Heath held on to their 3\u20132 lead. The League match at home to Sheffield Wednesday was one of several victims of the weather. The referee had initially passed the ground fit for play, but continued heavy rain turned the pitch into a quagmire and forced a late postponement.
