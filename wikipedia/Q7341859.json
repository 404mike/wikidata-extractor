James Law, a fervent minister from Kirkliston in West Lothian, was appointed Bishop of Orkney by King James in 1605. Eventually subjugated by Bishop Law, Black Patie was incarcerated and then executed after he enraged King James; Patie's illegitimate son, Robert, was also executed after he was forced to surrender following a siege at Kirkwall Castle in 1614. In addition, the old Norse Laws were officially replaced by the laws of Scotland in 1611 and, according to the scholar Robert Barclay, while \"the earl's court had manipulated the law, the bishop's court now administered justice\". The most intensive period during which the witches were persecuted on Orkney was from 1615 until 1645. The historian Liv Helene Willumsen considers the court reforms instigated by Bishop Law around 1614 and the restoration of the bishops impacted significantly on the witch trials, but failed to improve the neutrality of the proceedings."]}]}}
