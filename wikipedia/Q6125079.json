In the absence of captain Jake Wright, he was made captain for the match against Cheltenham Town on 14 September 2013, which ended 2\u20132. After the match, Whing described the award of the captain's armband as a \"privilege\". In the next game, a 1\u20130 defeat to Chesterfield, Whing was sent off in the 67th minute for a professional foul on Eoin Doyle. After serving a suspension and making his return, Whing suffered an ankle injury during a match against Mansfield Town, which led to his being sidelined until January. An operation further extended his period out of the team, and he remained on the sidelines until 21 March 2014, when he made his return to the starting eleven in a 1\u20130 win over Hartlepool United. Whing went on to make eighteen appearances for the club in 2013\u201314."]}, {"page": "Myles Weston", "response": ["Weston scored on his debut two days later against Bradford City. After the match, Weston said there's more to come of scoring goals later in the season. He scored again a week after scoring on his debut, in a 1\u20131 draw against Dagenham & Redbridge. For his performance, Weston was nominated for the npower Player of the Month Awards for August, but lost out to Jake Wright. Since making his debut, Weston quickly established himself in the first team in the attacking position until he suffered a back injury that kept him out for two matches. After returning to the first team, he then scored two goals in two matches between 13 October 2012 and 20 October 2012 against Aldershot Town and Burton Albion. He also scored two more goals by the end of 2012 against Accrington Staney and Fleetwood Town. Despite being sidelined once more, due to injury, later in the season, Weston went on to two more goals later in the season against Northampton Town and Burton Albion. In his first season at Gillingham, Weston helped the club gain promotion to League One and went on to score eight times in forty appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Chris Basham", "response": ["In the 2016\u201317 season, Basham continued to be in the first team regular at the club following the arrival of Manager Chris Wilder and played in the midfield position. Basham then scored his first goal of the season, but was later sent-off in the second half, in a 2\u20132 draw against Scunthorpe United on 24 September 2016. After serving a three match suspension, Basham returned to the first team, on 18 October 2016, making his first start from suspension, in a 3\u20130 win against Shrewsbury Town, followed up by scoring in the next game, in a 3\u20133 draw against Bradford City. Two weeks later, on 6 November 2016, Basham scored and set up one of the goals, in a 6\u20130 win over Leyton Orient in the first round of the FA Cup. Due to his impressive performance at the club, Manager Wilder hinted that Basham could be earning a new contract, with a year to his contract left. As the 2016\u201317 season progressed, Basham began to play in the defense, as a centre-back, partnering with either Jack O'Connell, Ethan Ebanks-Landell and Jake Wright. Around the same time, Basham played in the midfield position, with Paul Coutts. Then, in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale on 14 April 2017, Basham produced an impressive display when he set up two goals. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, which saw Sheffield United promoted to Championship after six seasons in League One, Basham went on to make 48 appearances and scoring two times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Adam Chapman", "response": ["Shortly after his return to Oxford United in September 2011, he sustained an ankle injury in a friendly game. He made his first first-team appearance in the Football League as a late substitute against Morecambe on 10 December 2011. In January 2012 he went on trial with Blue Square Premier side Mansfield Town, with a view to a loan move, which did not materialise. At the end of the month he joined Newport County on a month's loan. Oxford agreed to extend the loan, but then recalled him after an injury to Jake Wright. Chapman made 13 League appearances for Oxford following his recall, scoring once, directly from a corner against Torquay on 9 April 2012. In July 2012 he signed a further two-year deal with the club, having turned down two earlier contract offers."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Jake Wright||||2006||1||0||"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|14||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"|Jake Wright", "| 30 June 2010 || Jake Wright || Brighton & Hove Albion||align=\"center\"| Free ||align=\"center\"|", "|31 December 2009 || Jake Wright|| Brighton and Hove Albion||align=\"center\"|30 June 2010||align=\"center\"|"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|6||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"|Jake Wright"]}, {"page": "2010 Conference Premier play-off Final", "response": ["|CB ||14 ||Jake Wright"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season", "response": ["|July 2010 ||Jake Wright||Oxford United||Free||"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Football League Two", "response": ["| Jake Wright"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|6 || ||DF ||Jake Wright || 6|| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 6 || 1"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Football League Two", "response": ["|Jake Wright", "|Jake Wright"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|6 || ||DF ||Jake Wright || 4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 6 || 0"]}, {"page": "John Lundstram", "response": ["In his second season at Oxford United, his appointment as team captain, at the age of 22, was announced on 12 July 2016 following the departure of long-serving defender Jake Wright.

After beating Luton Town in the semi-finals of the EFL Trophy on 1 March 2017, Lundstram played in the final, where he stated he learned his lesson following a suspension that cost him a place in the previous final.
