She was born in New York on 11 November 1979, and spent her childhood in Indonesia, America and the UK. She graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 2003 and completed her postgraduate degree at Royal Academy of Arts in 2006. In the same year, she was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank Award in Fine Art. Highly regarded for her site-specific work in the public realm, she has since undertaken commissions that include the Folkestone Triennial (2017), Songdo Tech City (2016), Liverpool Biennial (2012), The Southbank Centre (2008), and TFL Art on the Underground (2007). She held the inaugural Bridget Riley Fellowship 2016\u201317 at the British School at Rome, is the recipient of the British Council\u2019s International Development Award and was shortlisted for the Jerwood Painting Prize. She lives and works between London and Bali.\nTantra\u2019s practice is diverse, ranging from painted canvases, to site-specific sculptural interventions, to large-scale public artworks. She describes her work as 'painting on an architectural scale'. Colour is central to her practice, as a 'material which lies between the language of art and industry'. Her distinctive palette is inspired by her Balinese heritage and childhood holidays: 'I remember things through colour \u2013  especially the way in which colours vibrate against each other. I like the idea of \u2018colour semiotics\u2019 and the associations one has to particular colours in relationship to either brand or narrative.'Her work has been described as \"exuberant\", a \"hedonistic celebration of excess and decoration\", and her contribution to public art by transforming spaces with \"chaotic yet captivating images\" has been recognised by collectors and commissioners alike. Her 2010 work Universe of Objects in Archive, Arsenic and Railings praised for lifting the perspective \"like the energy of a released spring and pulses horizontally around the room in endless optical trigonometric fugue\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liverpool Biennial", "response": ["Artists who were part of The Unexpected Guest included Doug Aitken with David Adjaye, John Akomfrah, Hurvin Anderson, Janine Antoni, Keith Arnatt, Kader Attia, Yael Bartana, Sylvie Blocher, Andrea Bowers, Sophie Calle, Rhys Chatham, Libia Castro and \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson, Enrico David, Eugenio Dittborn, Elmgreen and Dragset, Peter Fischli & David Weiss , FormContent, Dora Garcia, Gilbert and George, Simryn Gill, Mona Hatoum, Fritz Haeg, Oded Hirsch, Thomas Hirschhorn, Nadia Kaabi Linke, Markus Kahre, William Kentridge, Anja Kirschner and David Panos, Jakob Kolding, Jiri Kovanda, Suzanne Lacy, Runo Lagomarsino, Jorge Macchi, Dane Mitchell, Sabelo Mlangeni, Mark Morrisroe, Patrick Murphy, Ahmet \u00d6g\u00fct, Field Operations, Trevor Paglen, Christodoulos Panayiotou, Martin Parr, Pedro Reyes, Rhizome, Pamela Rosenkranz, George Shaw, Pak Sheung Chuen, Patrick Waterhouse, Mikhael Subotzky, Superflex, Sinta Tantra, Althea Thauberger, Mark Titchner, Jeanne van Heeswijk, Mark Wallinger, Jemima Wyman, Ming Wong, Kohei Yoshiyuki and Akram Zaatari"]}, {"page": "Sinta Tantra", "response": ["thumb|Sinta Tantra being interviewed in Bali.

Inspired by the diversity of Tontine Street's migrant residents, Tantra took visual cues from an eclectic mix of sources. The fluid lines and spliced circles flanking one side of the building are a gesture to the colour patterns of Sonia Delaunay (1885-1979). The work's title, and its colours (candy pink, racing green and Wedgewood blue) were lifted from a poster from 1947 advertising rail travel to Folkestone.[26] She says \u2018I wanted to inject some of that [advert\u2019s] romance into the intervention\u2019."]}, {"page": "Locws international", "response": ["|Sinta Tantra", "The artists commissioned for the Art Across the City 2013 Spring programme were: Pete Fowler, Olaf Breuning, Sinta Tantra, David Long, Philip Cheater.
