He scored his first competitive goal for Shrewsbury when he was recalled to the starting line-up in a 2\u20130 win over Crewe Alexandra on 20 August. His goal came in the 23rd minute with a glancing header from Lionel Ainsworth's cross. However, the form of Matt Richards and loan signing David McAllister again left him sitting on the sidelines for much of the season. Shrewsbury won promotion to League One as runners-up of League Two, although McAllister was not offered a new contract. He said that \"Hopefully my experience at a higher level, and the fact that I've got a promotion under my belt, will help my cause.
