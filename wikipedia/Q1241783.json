Presbyterian missionaries proved particularly successful on Aneityum, though less so on Tanna, with missionaries being repeatedly chased off the island by locals throughout the 1840s\u201360s.

His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; a stickler for accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about things he had personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in a house on the Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams's Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams's book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as \"a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific\", adding that \"by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling\"."]}, {"page": "Nafanua", "response": ["It was in Falealupo, one tradition holds, that Nafanua foretold the coming of Christianity.

In 1830, the missionary John Williams arrived on the shores (matani'u feagaimaleata) of Sapapali'i and brought the bible from his boat into the hands of Malietoa Vainu'upo, the son of Malietoa Fitisemanu. Thus, Malietoa Vainu'upo became known as \"The King whom Samoa listens to\". King Malietoa became one of the kings of Samoa and he was instrumental in uniting all of Samoa.
