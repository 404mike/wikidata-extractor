Such was the quality of Luton's team at this time that despite playing in the third tier, a fixture between Ireland and England at Windsor Park on 22 October 1921 saw three Luton players on the pitch\u2014Louis Bookman and Allan Mathieson for Ireland, and the club's top goalscorer, Simms, for England. However, after Luton finished fourth in the division, the squad was broken up as Simms, Bookman and Mathieson joined South Shields, Port Vale and Exeter City respectively. Luton stayed in the Third Division South until 1936\u201337, when the team finished top and won promotion to the Second Division, at that time the second tier of English football. During the promotion season, striker Joe Payne scored 55 goals in 39 games; during the previous season he had scored 10 in one match against Bristol Rovers, which remains a Football League record today."]}, {"page": "History of Luton Town F.C.

Simms scored 34 goals during the season to top-score for the club. Such was the quality of Luton's squad that three Luton players played in a single international at Windsor Park on 22 October 1922 \u2013 Louis Bookman and Allan Mathieson for Ireland, and Ernie Simms for England.  Despite Luton's playing resources, the side disappointingly finished only fourth. The main stand was destroyed in a fire and rebuilt before the start of the 1922\u201323. As the club finished fifth, seventh and then 17th, hopes of quick promotion disappeared."]}, {"page": "Ernie Simms", "response": ["He received his first call into an England squad in late 1920 as a non-playing reserve, before winning his first, and only, cap a year later. 22 October 1921 saw Simms make history at Windsor Park, Belfast \u2013 becoming the first Third Division centre forward ever to play for England. The match ended in a 1\u20131 draw, and Luton's team of the time was so strong that the Ireland team included Luton's other two forwards, Louis Bookman and Allan Mathieson.

He scored again in the next match as the team gained their first point of the season away from home, drawing 1\u20131 at Wigan Borough, who had been Nelson's first ever opponents in the Football League over three years previously. Half-back Ernie Braidwood scored his first goal of the campaign in the 2\u20131 win against Halifax Town. Eddie Cameron also scored for the home side, and Walter Moore made his senior debut in the match. November began badly for Nelson as they suffered their heaviest defeat of the season, a 0\u20135 loss away at New Brighton. Allan Mathieson and Joe Wilcox scored two goals each as New Brighton won the first ever competitive meeting between the two sides. Nelson moved up to sixth place in the league following the next match, a 1\u20130 win at home to Grimsby Town. However, the team continued their poor form away from Seedhill, losing 1\u20133 to table-topping Darlington on 15 November. Seven days later, Bottrill scored the only goal of the match as Nelson beat Rochdale to record their eighth consecutive home win."]}]}}
