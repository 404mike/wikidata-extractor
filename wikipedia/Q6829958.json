Others influenced by Neill included John Aitkenhead, Michael Duane, and R. F. Mackenzie. Richard Bailey wrote that Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner's followers were more evangelical in character, and that Neill deterred would-be devotees. He specifically discouraged American association with his school in both name and likeness. By 1972, Ray Hemmings wrote that Neill's ideas were misinterpreted in the hands of other schools. Hemmings found Neill to have moderate influence on state schools in areas such as teacher\u2013student interactions. Neill's views on sexuality and non-compulsory lessons did not have widespread acceptance. Herb Snitzer said that Neill \"influenced thousand of teachers\". Both George Dennison and Bailey felt Neill's influence to not be easily measurable, with Dennison adding that non-Summerhill schools continue to adopt Neillian thought."]}, {"page": "Duane (surname)", "response": ["* Michael Duane (1915\u20131997), Irish-born British progressive educationalist and headteacher"]}, {"page": "Michael Duane (head teacher)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Duane"]}, {"page": "Duane, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Duane"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Dame Alice Owen's School", "response": ["* Michael Duane (1915\u20131997), teacher known for his progressive views on education (taught at the school 1939\u201340, then in 1946)"]}]}}
