He was successful in both concert hall and opera house, being noted, inter alia, for the heavy Wagnerian bass roles.\nOn 5 October 1938 he was one of the original 16 singers in Ralph Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music. The solo lines composed for him set the words, 'The reason is, your spirits are attentive' and 'Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.'\nRobert Easton was severely wounded in the trenches in the First World War, having a leg amputated, and when he was invalided out of the army he was offered training, first as an accountant, which he realised quickly he was not suited for, and then as a singer.\nHis 'debut' (so he always said) was deputising for an indisposed Harold Williams at the Royal Albert Hall in the early 1920s, singing Stanford's Songs of the Sea under Thomas Beecham, who then offered him many opportunities to forward his career.\nHe recorded principally for the Columbia label, but, unfortunately, most of these do not do his voice justice. Private recordings made in the 1950s are a much better indication of what he really sounded like, the voice being warm and round. He was a true bass, being able to sing bottom B\u266d with ease.\nIn 1930s he sang at Covent Garden and in the early 1950s took part in the first BBC television broadcast, thereafter appearing frequently, including having his own series.\nHe continued singing as well as being an inspirational teacher throughout the 1970s until he died in 1987. He freely gave of his time for all kinds of charity recitals and when Owen Brannigan was severely injured in a car crash took over many of his engagements, in spite of being in his seventies.\nHe had a large build with a sense of humour to match and even in later life used to flirt with every attractive young lady he would encounter on the London Underground. Having said this, he was very happily married, with one daughter, and lived in Haslemere for at least the last twenty years of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Serenade to Music", "response": ["|Robert Easton, Norman Allin", "|Robert Easton", "|Robert Easton"]}, {"page": "Muriel Brunskill", "response": ["Her other recordings include Gounod's Faust, with Harold Williams, Robert Carr, and Robert Easton, conducted by Clarence Raybould; Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music, with Lilian Stiles-Allen, Isobel Baillie, Elsie Suddaby, Eva Turner, Margaret Balfour, Astra Desmond, Mary Jarred, Parry Jones, Heddle Nash, Frank Titterton, Walter Widdop, Roy Henderson, Norman Allin, Robert Easton, Harold Williams, the Queen's Hall Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Henry Wood; and John Tor\u00e9's Golden City, original cast recording, with Edmund Purdom, Eleanor Summerfield and Emile Belcourt."]}, {"page": "Robert Easton", "response": ["Robert Easton may refer to:", "*Robert Easton (actor) (1930\u20132011), American radio, film, and television actor, and dialect coach in Hollywood, who also worked in England for a period", "*Robert Easton (bass) (1898\u20131987), British bass singer", "*Robert Easton (government official), New York Insurance Department Deputy Superintendent and General Counsel", "*Robert Easton (athlete) (born 1960/61), Canadian Paralympic athlete", "*Robert Easton Burns (1805\u20131863), Canadian lawyer and judge"]}, {"page": "Robert Easton (singer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Easton (bass)"]}, {"page": "Faust discography", "response": ["|Heddle NashRobert EastonMiriam Licette"]}, {"page": "Ivor Newton", "response": ["The artists Ivor Newton appeared with included Isobel Baillie, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling, Dino Borgioli, Maria Callas, Pablo Casals, Feodor Chaliapin, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Robert Easton, Emanuel Feuermann, Kirsten Flagstad, Elena Gerhardt, Beniamino Gigli, Frederick Grinke, Ida Haendel, Josef Hassid, Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles, John McCormack, Nellie Melba, Yehudi Menuhin, Grace Moore, Maria M\u00fcller, Gregor Piatigorsky, Lily Pons, Vladimir Rosing, Tito Schipa, Elisabeth Schumann, Oda Slobodskaya, Conchita Superv\u00eda, Dame Clara Butt, Maggie Teyte and Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe."]}]}}
