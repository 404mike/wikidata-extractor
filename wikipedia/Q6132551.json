He is probably best known today for his theological articulation of the meaning of the atonement within Christian theology, atonement for him being \u201cthe most profound of all truths\u201d (The Death of Christ, 243). Many have misunderstood his position, arguing that he was known for his defense of the doctrine of penal penal substitution. However, Denny himself protested vigorously against this characterization (see Theological Position below).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Robertson Nicoll", "response": ["Nicoll secured many writers of exceptional talent for his paper (including Marcus Dods, J. M. Barrie, Ian Maclaren, Alexander Whyte, Alexander Maclaren, Carnegie Simpson and James Denney), to which he added his own considerable talents as a contributor.
