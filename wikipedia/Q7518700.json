He contributed to and edited The Language of Electroacoustic Music in 1986 (still in print) and Music, Electronic Media and Culture (Ashgate, 2000). His book Living Electronic Music was published by Ashgate in 2007, also two solo CDs from Sargasso in 2007 and 2008. He was founder secretary of the Electroacoustic Music Association of Great Britain (EMAS) in 1979, and served on the board of Sonic Arts Network from its inception until 2004. From 2008 to 2012 he was a member of the board of trustees of its successor organisation 'Sound and Music'.

Brownian motion is a four-dimensional phenomenon (three spatial dimensions and time), and Xenakis created the score by first creating a two-dimensional graph, necessitating some simplifications. The abscissa () represents time at 5\u00a0cm = 26 MM, while the ordinates () represent pitch at 1 semitone = .25\u00a0cm, when transcribed into musical notation 5\u00a0cm = 1 measure. This length is subdivided into three, four, and five equal parts, allowing for fine differences in duration but also creating a steady pulse in each instrumental part, reducing the rhythm of the random walk to steady footsteps. Composer Simon Emmerson notes that this regularity is \"impossible in reality and fails to use his \u2018stochastic\u2019 approach in this instance.\" Each part gets nowhere, but as a whole the mass's pitch is freely modulated and its speed-determined \"temperature\" varies."]}, {"page": "Daniel Biro", "response": ["In 1993, Biro founded Sargasso Records to promote contemporary experimental music.
