He made many contributions, notably in instrumental variables estimation, Edgeworth expansions for the distributions of econometric estimators, identification conditions in simultaneous equations models, asymptotic tests for overidentifying restrictions in homoskedastic equations and exact tests for unit roots in autoregressive and moving average models.  At the LSE, Sargan was Professor of Econometrics from 1964\u20131984. Sargan was President of the Econometric Society, a Fellow of the British Academy  and an (honorary foreign) member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.His influence on econometric methodology is evident in several fields including in the development of Generalized Method of Moments estimators.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John von Neumann", "response": ["Subsequently, Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava extended the results for testing if the errors on a regression model follow a Gaussian random walk (i.e., possess a unit root) against the alternative that they are a stationary first order autoregression."]}, {"page": "Tjalling Koopmans", "response": ["Koopmans's early works on the Hartree\u2013Fock theory are associated with the Koopmans' theorem, which is very well known in quantum chemistry. Koopmans was awarded his Nobel memorial prize (jointly with Leonid Kantorovich) for his contributions to the field of resource allocation, specifically the theory of optimal use of resources. The work for which the prize was awarded focused on activity analysis, the study of interactions between the inputs and outputs of production, and their relationship to economic efficiency and prices. Finally, the importance of the article by Koopmans (1942) deriving the distribution of the serial correlation coefficient was recognized by John von Neumann, and it later influenced the optimal tests for a unit root by John Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava (Sargan and Bhargava, 1983)."]}, {"page": "Peter C.
