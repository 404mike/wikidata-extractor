Following the resultant internal restructuring, a change of fortunes soon followed as new captain Alec Stewart \u2013 son of Micky \u2013 led the team to the Sunday League title in 1996. This in turn proved to be the catalyst for further success under the captaincy of Adam Hollioake and the influence of Keith Medlycott, who was county coach from 1997 to 2003. County Championship triumphs in 1999, 2000 and 2002 were complemented with Benson and Hedges Cup victories in 1997 and 2001, a National League Division Two title in 2000 and the inaugural Twenty20 Cup in 2003. This was in spite of the death of the highly talented all-rounder Ben Hollioake, Adam Hollioake's younger brother, who was involved in a fatal car accident in early 2002. That same year, Ali Brown posted what remains today a world record List A score of 268 against Glamorgan at The Oval, beating Graeme Pollock's former record score in the first of his two one-day double hundreds for Surrey. Adam Hollioake retired after the 2004 season."]}, {"page": "Reed's School", "response": ["*Keith Medlycott, cricket coach"]}, {"page": "Yips", "response": ["In cricket, the yips applies mostly to bowlers. The affliction seems to involve bowlers having trouble releasing the ball at the end of their action. An example of this was Keith Medlycott, who having reached the England squad was forced to abandon the sport. Another player, Gavin Hamilton, having played a Test as an all-rounder, largely abandoned his right-arm medium pace bowling, following the yips. He did not make another Test appearance, but has enjoyed a One Day International career for Scotland, predominantly as a specialist batsman.

Of the eleven that started the match, only John Stephenson and Nasser Hussain had played Test cricket prior to this match. The team included future Test cricketers Martin Bicknell, Richard Blakey, Richard Illingworth, Tim Munton, and Graham Thorpe.
