Nelson were enjoying a golden period in their history: promoted to the newly-formed Northern Section of the Third Division, joining the Football League for the first time. Their team included George Wilson, a former international out of Sheffield Wednesday, as gate receipts reached a new high, when they met Accrington Stanley at Seedhill on 15 October 1921. The Scots player-manager Wilson was a shrewd judge of character. Nelson won the Division that season with reserve players on the bench: many of whom had fought in the Great War. In total Bruce appeared ten times for Nelson with mainly clean sheets, making his debut against Chesterfield on 22 October 1921. He conceded a goal that day, but Nelson won the match at Saltergate, and then a week later at Seedhill, a clean sheet. This impressed the manager, so he played the season. However, on Boxing Day 1921 he conceded five in a home defeat to Durham City."]}, {"page": "George Wilson (English footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Wilson (footballer, born 1892)"]}, {"page": "1923 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||5 || George Wilson, The Wednesday"]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. international footballers", "response": ["|George Wilson"]}]}}
