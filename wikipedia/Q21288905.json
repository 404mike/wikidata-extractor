He is best known for his watercolours and etchings of European landscapes and architectural subjects. Born in Tayport, Fife, Laing lived and worked throughout Europe, producing a portfolio of notable work from Spain, Paris, Chartres, Antwerp and Venice before returning to Scotland.\nAn elected Associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, his etchings were commended by noted American artist and etcher, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who he was a follower of. He exhibited widely, including at the Royal Academy (RA), Royal Scottish Academy (RSA) and the Paris Salon. In 1900 he won a jury commendation at the Paris Exposition Universelle.\nWhile most of his work is held in private collections, there are examples to be found in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection, the Aberdeen Art Gallery,\nand the University of Dundee\u2019s Fine Art collection.Along with Alec Grieve, Laing founded the Tayport Artists\u2019 Circle in 1905. Its other members included noted Scottish painters David Foggie, Stewart Carmichael and James Douglas. Laing was active in promoting the cause of local Scottish artists and arts groups before dying at the relatively young age of 45.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newport-on-Tay", "response": ["The arts have played a major role in the shaping of Newport and its neighbourhood.

In 1904 he and Frank Laing became the founders of the Tayport Artists' Circle, an exhibiting body of artists hoping to emulate the commercial success of other artists' colonies such as at Newlyn. Their first exhibition was held in Tayport in 1905, with three exhibitions following in Dundee in 1905-07 and one in Edinburgh in 1907. "]}]}}
