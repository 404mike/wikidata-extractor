She grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs of Havertown, Lansdowne and Swarthmore, and graduated from Swarthmore High School in 1982.  She attended Harvard University, and was on the staff of the Harvard Lampoon.  Her first primetime TV job was on The Critic, where she directed the episode with guest stars Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, followed by directing for King of the Hill. She went on to become the supervising director and designer for Mission Hill. After the show was cancelled quickly, she got a job directing on The Simpsons, and stayed for three seasons.

", "Get a Horse! was conceived and directed by Lauren MacMullan, who became the first woman to solo direct a Disney animated film. She started working on the short after Wreck-It Ralph director, Rich Moore, told her that Disney was looking for some Mickey Mouse ideas for television. Being fond of the earliest Mickey Mouse shorts, mostly because of their simplicity and freshness, she opted for a style resembling the 1920s animation. Produced in a year and 6 months, its hand-drawn animation was supervised by Eric Goldberg, and its computer animation by Adam Green. To achieve the 1928 look, aging and blur filters were added to the image, while for the CG part, they created new models, faithful to the character designs of 1928. The look of Pete's clothing and car were inspired by his design in the 1929 short The Barn Dance.", "Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter lauded the short film as \"one of the wittiest and most inventive animated shorts in a long time\". He particularly points out that the film \"begins as an early black-and-white Mickey Mouse cartoon but then bursts its boundaries into color and 3D in marvelously antic ways that call to mind the stepping-off-the-screen techniques of Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr. and Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo. It's a total winner.\" Scott Foundas of Variety agreed, labeling the film as \"utterly dazzling\". Drew McWeeny of HitFix lauded it as \"the perfect companion piece\" and \"enormously entertaining\". He continues on that \"Filmmaker Lauren MacMullan perfectly nails the look and feel of the early days of the Disney studio, and it is the first time I have ever laughed out loud at Mickey Mouse. It's an inventive and technically precise short, and it also celebrates and deconstructs Disney's animated history in a very fun way.\"", "| Lauren MacMullan & Dorothy McKim", "| Lauren MacMullan"]}]}}
