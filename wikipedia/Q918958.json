One side of the cube is composed of highly polished metal, two of dull metal (copper) and one side painted black. He showed that radiation was greatest from the black side and negligible from the polished side. The apparatus is known as a Leslie cube.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Friction", "response": ["John Leslie (1766\u20131832) noted a weakness in the views of Amontons and Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive asperities, why then isn't it balanced through descending the opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion. In Leslie's view, friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down asperities, which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before."]}, {"page": "Meteorology", "response": ["In 1648, Blaise Pascal rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height, and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere.Florin to Pascal, September 1647, \u0152uves completes de Pascal, 2:682. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamics, initiating the Kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases. In 1761, Joseph Black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting. In 1772, Black's student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen, which he called phlogisticated air, and together they developed the phlogiston theory.Biographical note at \"Lectures and Papers of Professor Daniel Rutherford (1749\u20131819), and Diary of Mrs Harriet Rutherford\" . In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion.\"Sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" (\"On Combustion in general\", 1777) and \"Consid\u00e9rations G\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la Nature des Acides\" (\"General Considerations on the Nature of Acids\", 1778).

In 1804, Sir John Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black-body radiation. In 1808, John Dalton defended caloric theory in A New System of Chemistry and described how it combines with matter, especially gases; he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight. In 1824, Sadi Carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a reversible process and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics."]}, {"page": "List of physicists", "response": ["*John Leslie \u2013 U.K. (1766\u20131832)"]}, {"page": "Multiplication table", "response": ["In his 1820 book The Philosophy of Arithmetic, mathematician John Leslie published a multiplication table up to 99 \u00d7 99, which allows numbers to be multiplied in pairs of digits at a time.
