Thompson said the various versions of the character from the comics \"left us a lot of leeway\" in creating the film version. Waititi \"wanted to make sure we weren't making a female character that was boring and pretty\", and Feige said Marvel wanted to pair Thor with a love interest more his equal than Jane Foster. Co-screenwriters Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost's original draft of the film had more of a romantic relationship between Thor and Valkyrie. When Pearson started working on the film, he moved away from that storyline, instead focusing more on \"the mutual respect\" between the characters and Valkyrie \"dealing with her PTSD. She's someone who's drowning her sorrows in the bottle, and I just thought that was such a cool thing that you don't often see\". Thompson stated that the character is bisexual, which she based on the character's comic book relationship with Annabelle Riggs, and convinced Waititi to shoot a glimpse of a woman walking out of Valkyrie's bedroom, which was later cut from the film, as Waititi thought that it distracted from the scene's exposition. Thompson was inspired by pictures of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) while training for the role, and worked with dialect coach Andrew Jack to create an Asgardian-sounding accent that was different enough to sound like she had been away from there for a long time. Thompson will appear in future MCU films."]}, {"page": "The Batman (film)", "response": ["Production was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning two months after filming started. When the pandemic began, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting, unlike other major studios. However, it eventually did so on March 14. Warner Bros. stated that the hiatus would just be for two weeks, but Reeves announced on March 25 that filming had been suspended indefinitely. Production was unlikely to restart until at least mid-May, and Warner Bros. pushed the release date back to October 1, 2021, in April.

The role was voiced by the film's dialect coach, Andrew Jack (although director Guy Ritchie refused to reveal his identity). Jared Harris played the role in the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, as well as redubbing the character's lines from the first film in subsequent home releases and television broadcasts. In the second film, Moriarty and Holmes attend a European Peace Conference held near the Reichenbach Falls which Moriarty seeks to sabotage, and the two plunge down from a balcony overlooking the falls, Holmes being too injured to defeat Moriarty in a straight fight but knowing that Moriarty will go after Watson if he lives.
