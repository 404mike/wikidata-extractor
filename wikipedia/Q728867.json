It starred Martin Shaw, Lewis Collins and Gordon Jackson as agents of the fictional \"CI5\" (Criminal Intelligence 5, alluding to the real-life MI5).", "The choice of CI5's name is possibly inspired by Criminal Investigation Department and MI5. The premise allowed the programme-makers to involve a wide variety of villains, including terrorists, hit-men, racist groups and espionage suspects, with plots sometimes relating to the Cold War. Led by George Cowley (Gordon Jackson), CI5 is known for using unconventional and sometimes illegal methods to beat criminals, or as Cowley put it \"Fight fire with fire!\" The use of a fictitious force in this context was somewhat less controversial than the portrayal of the real Flying Squad in The Sweeney.", "Major George Cowley (Gordon Jackson) (born c. 1917) \u2013 Nicknamed \"Morris\"The Professionals Series 5, Episode 10: \"A Man Called Quinn\" after the car of the same name.

In his last interview about the series, Brian Clemens laughed off the actors' claims about 'doing their own stunts' in the cars. He said that they had been taught little more than how to execute a handbrake turn. The British stuntman and stunt co-ordinator Peter Brayham did most of the precision driving, and with his dark curly hair, often stood in for Martin Shaw during the scenes where Doyle was driving. Shaw in particular, was known within the production team to be fairly inept with the cars. He was far too heavy on the brakes and throttle, regularly kerbed the cars, and often over-steered himself into trouble. This can be seen in many episodes. In the episode \"Weekend in the Country\", Gordon Jackson can be seen pulling away from a stationary position at the roadside, in a Chrysler Alpine. He can be seen pulling out without fully checking the traffic flow, directly in front of an approaching Volkswagen Beetle. This inevitably led to either an accident, or a dramatic near miss, but the editor obviously cut to the next scene at this point.", "Martin Shaw was publicly critical of the series during its production, feeling that he was playing a one-dimensional character in a one-dimensional show. Several years after the series ended London Weekend Television was contractually obliged to re-negotiate repeat fees with the lead actors. Unwilling to accede to Martin Shaw's demands, plans for further repeat screenings on the UK's ITV network had to be withdrawn, leading to Lewis Collins expressing his frustration toward Shaw in an interview for the British press. However, Shaw eventually agreed to UK satellite screenings; although, according to a Radio Times interview, they did so only after being discreetly made aware that Gordon Jackson's widow, actress Rona Anderson (who guested in \"Cry Wolf\"), was suffering financial difficulties  after her husband's death and needed the repeat fees."]}, {"page": "Whisky Galore (novel)", "response": ["Whisky Galore! is a 1949 British comedy film produced by Ealing Studios, starring Basil Radford, Bruce Seton, Joan Greenwood and Gordon Jackson.
