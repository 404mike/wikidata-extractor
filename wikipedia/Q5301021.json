He was only with Harp for a matter of months, playing in a few matches at the end of the 1946\u201347 season. At the beginning of the following season he was still signed with Harp, but was turning out for Newport. He joined Sheffield Wednesday in September 1947 after a successful trial. Signed as an inside forward, he initially struggled and was made available for transfer towards the end of his first season, but was then successfully converted into a wing-half by manager Eric Taylor. Given a first team opportunity as a result of an injury to Wednesday captain Doug Witcomb, Locherty made his Football League debut in a Second Division match against Bradford (Park Avenue) on 11 December 1948, playing at right-half. His initial success in the team meant that when Witcomb returned to fitness, the captain was moved to the left-half position to accommodate Locherty's continued inclusion. He went on to make ten League appearances for Wednesday."]}, {"page": "Douglas Witcomb", "response": ["#REDIRECT Doug Witcomb"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 1999", "response": ["*Doug Witcomb, 81, Welsh football player."]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. international footballers", "response": ["|Doug Witcomb"]}, {"page": "Witcomb", "response": ["*Doug Witcomb (1918\u20131999), British football player"]}]}}
