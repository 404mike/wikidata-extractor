Likewise, Walter Ullmann has argued that the age was a radical one, in which the temporal power\u2014specifically, the \"educated lay element\"\u2014was encroaching upon traditional spiritual realms.", "From Eugenius, Adrian inherited what Walter Ullmann has called a \"mutual assistance pact\" with the Emperor, the Treaty of Constance, signed the year of Eugenius' death. For the popes, its most important aspect was the stipulation that the crowning of the next emperor was contingent on expelling Arnold of Brescia from Rome. It also assured each party of the other's support against both King William in Sicily and the Byzantine Empire when necessary. The treaty was confirmed by Adrian in January 1155. Eugenius was a believer in the Gregorian doctrine of Papal supremacy, stating that Christ \"gave to St Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of both the earthly and the heavenly empire\". From the beginning of his reign, Barbarossa sought to present himself as the heir to a long, established line of Roman Emperors, and likewise that his empire was a continuation of theirs. The historian Anne A. Latowsky explains how this was the cause of tension in the European polity:", "In the 14th century Adrian was recorded in St Albans' Book of Benefactors, which, suggests Bolton, \"ensured that the memory of the English Pope would remain forever\". The 19th-century antiquarian Bishop Stubbs described Adrian IV as, in his view, \"a great pope; that is a great constructive pope, not a controversial one, like those who preceded and followed\". Walter Ullmann argues that Adrian's pontificate \"left an imprint upon contemporary Europe which is not yet fully recognised\". One reviewer has described Adrian's pontificate as, traditionally, \"largely remembered as the answer to a trivia question (who was the only English pope?) or as a footnote in Anglo-Irish history\". On the other hand, the Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History, Christopher N. L. Brooke argues that, on account of the number of different countries he dwelt in over the years, he illustrates the cosmopolitan nature of 12th-century religion."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Walter Ullmann (1910\u20131983), medieval"]}, {"page": "Rosamond McKitterick", "response": ["McKitterick's doctoral thesis was entitled The Carolingian Renaissance: A Study in the Education of a Society.

According to Walter Ullmann, the presence of the West Franks was on account of the \"barren ecclesiastical thought\" of the East, and the council proceeded to adopt West Frankish ideas of royal sacrality and anointing. It was \"the first phase in the process of assimilation of the two halves of the Carolingian inheritance\".Ullmann 1969, 124\u201327.

When Arnulf died in 899, his minor son, Louis IV, was crowned, but not anointed, and placed under the tutelage of Archbishop Hatto I of Mainz. Louis's coronation was the first in German history.

This was now replaced by the subjective point of view with the man taking precedence over the office.  In the turmoil of nationalism and ecclesiastical confusion, some theologians began aligning themselves more with their kings than with the church.

Rather the Lorsch annals state that the idea was discussed at an assembly held in Rome after Charlemagne's arrival (24 November), probably beginning on 30 November or 1 December. This entry was drawn up only after Charlemagne's return to Francia in 801, since an entry under 799 reports how the conspirators who overthrew Leo in April that year were then in exile. They were only finally exiled early in 801. This entry has, however, generated as much controversy as Einhard's statement of Charlemagne's ignorance. While Ganshof argued that the Annales were more trustworthy than Einhard, others have argued that Charlemagne's policy towards the Byzantine empire both before and after 800 shows little support for the pope's initiative.Even the Annales laureshamenses accord the pope the initiative in the imperial coronation. Cf. Walter Ullmann (1962), The Growth of Papal Government in the Middle Ages: A Study in the Ideological Relation of Clerical to Lay Power (Londong: Methuen), 102\u20133 n3. Scholars agreeing with Ullmann are Louis Halphen, S. Heldmann, E. Amann, W. Ohnsorge, and George Ostrogorsky. What Einhard shows Charlemagne objecting to is the Roman imperial title, not necessarily equality with the Byzantine emperors; thus the emphasis the Annales laureshamenses place on justifying the \"name of the emperor\".Ullmann, 116.

His research findings were no longer viewed by colleagues as mere anecdotal adornments to the more traditionally revered gleanings from a small number of surviving court documents, but as important evidential statements in their own right about the functioning of Medieval kingship.   This approach to research into historical rituals ties in with the increasingly widespread acceptance, during recent decades, of Cultural anthropology as an important element in the historian's tool-kit."]}]}}
