At the end of that season, manager Leslie Knighton left for Chelsea. His successor, George Liddell, brought in several new players and was willing to let go those he thought past their prime, one of whom was Curtis.

Bradford controlled a long ball, pivoted and shot past Pearson from 25 yards. But the lead did not last. Straight from the restart, Carter, W. G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford took the ball directly down the field.

Others took part in significant matches in club history. Billy Ollis, Jenkyns, Ted Devey, Jack Hallam, Wheldon and Tommy Hands appeared in Small Heath's first Football League match in 1892. Eight men listed here played in Birmingham's pioneering venture into club football in Europe in the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and ten played on the losing side in the 1956 FA Cup Final (an eleventh, Roy Warhurst, missed the match through injury). In more recent times, Paul Tait scored the first golden goal to decide a Wembley cup final, against Carlisle United in the 1995 Football League Trophy. Geoff Horsfield scored the extra-time equaliser that took the 2002 First Division play-off final into a shootout; Paul Devlin and Stan Lazaridis converted their spot-kicks as Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time. Seven men listed here, including captain Stephen Carr and goalscorer Nikola \u017digi\u0107, took the field as Birmingham won the 2011 League Cup; another two were unused substitutes. Just three years later, the first headed goal of full-back Paul Caddis's career, 93 minutes into the final match of the season, saved the team from relegation to the third tier of English football."]}, {"page": "History of Birmingham City F.C.

He was able to stabilise the team and in 1930\u201331, led them to their first FA Cup Final. Between semi-final and final Birmingham lost six of their nine league matches, and The Times reminded its readers that \"sickness and injury had played havoc with their men for weeks past. They had no regular practice together for the great match.\" Opponents West Bromwich Albion were heading for promotion from the Second Division, youthful and full of confidence. Bradford had played only once since the semi-final and declared himself fit on the morning of the match.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. pp. 18, 173. Birmingham had a goal disallowed early on, then fell behind; the clearly unfit Bradford was able to equalise, but W. G. Richardson went upfield straight from the kickoff and scored his side's winner. Knighton's team finished in the top half of the division in 1932, and he signed a contract extension, but when Chelsea made him an offer he could not refuse, he left, to be replaced by George Liddell, recently retired from playing.Matthews (1995).

He was a powerful player with good positional ability, who captained Birmingham's reserve team before establishing himself as club captain and linchpin of the first team's defence. He played for the Football League XI in 1921\u201322 against the Irish Football League. After leaving Birmingham he went on to play for four other Midlands teams, Aston Villa, Stoke, Coventry City and Walsall. On retiring from playing he worked for short periods as trainer at various clubs, including as trainer of Birmingham's juniors, and in 1932 he was appointed assistant manager of the club under Leslie Knighton and later under George Liddell."]}, {"page": "Harold Booton", "response": ["Booton was born in Annesley, Nottinghamshire. He began his football career with Annesley Colliery and Shirebrook, and joined Birmingham in 1929. He became a first-team regular for Birmingham after George Liddell retired, and made 162 appearances in all competitions, including 149 in the First Division. He was a solid tackler and kicked powerfully, but his distribution of the ball was wayward. He later played 7 league games for Luton Town, and then moved into non-league football with Atherstone Town. He died in Denham, Buckinghamshire, in 1976 at the age of 70."]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City F.C. managers", "response": ["There have been 39 full-time managers: the most recent appointee, Lee Bowyer, took over as head coach in March 2021. Bob McRoberts was appointed in 1910 as Birmingham's first manager whose role did not include secretarial duties. George Liddell has had the longest tenure, of six years and two months (267 matches) in the 1930s, while Trevor Francis has managed the team for most matches: 290 over five years and five months between 1996 and 2001. All three formerly played for the club. Under Arthur Turner, Birmingham won the 1954\u201355 Second Division title, followed up with what remains the team's highest league finish, sixth place in the 1955\u201356 First Division, and reached the 1956 FA Cup Final. Gil Merrick in 1963 and Alex McLeish in 2011 oversaw League Cup wins and Barry Fry led his team to a \"double\" of third-tier title and Football League Trophy in 1994\u201395.", "Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club secretary in 1911, and when the First World War broke out he took over the managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept them in the First Division, albeit in the lower half of the table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager."]}]}}
