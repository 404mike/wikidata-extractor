He was gazetted to the 43rd Regiment as an ensign on 9 May 1811, and served in the Peninsula; he became a Lieutenant on 24 February 1818, and was thenceforth on half-pay during the remainder of his life.\nFrom 1818 he devoted his attention to art, and became a professional painter at Plymouth. He chiefly produced small water-colours on tinted paper, about eight inches by five inches, which he sold at prices ranging from fifteen shillings to one guinea each.\nBetween 1830 and 1845 he exhibited two landscapes at the Royal Academy, four at the British Institution, and one at Suffolk Street Gallery. His best known painting is entitled The Old Hall at Cotehele on a Rent-day. He brought out a work called Cotehele, on the Banks of the Tamar, the ancient seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Mount-Edgcumbe, by N. Condy, with a descriptive account written by the Rev. F. V. J. Arundell, 17 plates, London, published by the author, at 17 Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, with text supplied by Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell.\nHe died at 10 Mount Pleasant Terrace, Plymouth, aged 64, and was buried in St. Andrew's churchyard.\nHe was married to Ann Trevanion Pyle (1792\u20131860), daughter of Captain Mark Oates of the Marines, and was the father of maritime painter Nicholas Matthews Condy, who is occasionally confused with him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Condy", "response": ["*Nicholas Condy (1793-1857), English landscape painter", "*Nicholas Matthews Condy (1816-1851), British maritime painter, son of Nicholas Condy"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Matthews Condy", "response": ["Nicholas Matthews Condy, or Nicholas Condy the Younger (1816 \u2013 20 May 1851) was a British maritime painter.", "He was born in Union Street, Plymouth, in 1816 to Nicholas Condy (1793\u20131857) and Ann Trevanion Condy (n\u00e9e Pyle; 1792\u20131860).

When Nicholas Condy, an artist at Plymouth, published a series of views of Cotehele, the ancient seat of Lord Mount Edgcumbe, Arundell supplied the description of the house which accompanied them. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1811, but removed from the fellowship in 1845, for being 28 years behind in his subscription."]}, {"page": "Condy, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Condy"]}]}}
