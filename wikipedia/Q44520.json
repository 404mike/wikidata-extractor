Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire moors. Otherwise she attended a boarding school in Mirfield between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846 she published a book of poems with her sisters and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel, Agnes Grey, was published in 1847 with Wuthering Heights. Her second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was published in 1848. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is thought to be one of the first feminist novels.Anne died at 29, probably of pulmonary tuberculosis. After Anne's death her sister Charlotte edited Agnes Grey to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. This is one reason why Anne is not as well known as her sisters.

In their childhood Emily and Anne Bront\u00eb created the imaginary kingdom of Gondal, about which they composed prose and poems. Thomas Moore's biography of Byron, with its description of womanizing, gaming and carousing, directly influenced the Gondal mythos and was echoed in Bront\u00eb's adult works. The characteristics of Arthur Huntington and Annabella Wilmot, both self-indulgent sexual transgressors, may be the relics of Gondal, where most of the main heroes were extravagant and led adventurous lives.", "Anne Bront\u00eb starts her novel in a social comedy manner, reminiscent of Jane Austen.

", "Spectator wrote: \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, like its predecessor [Jane Eyre], suggests the idea of considerable abilities ill applied. There is power, effect, and even nature, though of an extreme kind, in its pages; but there seems in the writer a morbid love for the coarse, not to say the brutal; so that his level subjects are not very attractive, and the more forcible are displeasing or repulsive, from their gross, physical, or profligate substratum. He might reply, that such things are in life... Mere existence, however, as we have often had occasion to remark, is not a sufficient reason for a choice of subject: its general or typical character is a point to consider, and its power of pleasing must be regarded, as well as its mere capabilities of force or effect. It is not only the subject of this novel, however, that is objectionable, but the manner of treating it. There is a coarseness of tone throughout the writing of all these Bells [Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bront\u00eb], that puts an offensive subject in its worst point of view, and which generally contrives to dash indifferent things\".Allott, The Brontes: The Critical Heritage, pp. 249\u2013250", "Elizabeth Gaskell repeated Charlotte's words about Anne in The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, claiming that the subject of The Tenant \"was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas.\" In his essay on Emily Bront\u00eb, Algernon Charles Swinburne briefly mentioned The Tenant in the context of Branwell's decline as a novel \"which deserves perhaps a little more notice and recognition than it has ever received\" and added that \"as a study of utterly flaccid and invertebrate immorality it bears signs of more faithful transcription from life than anything in Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights.\"  Margaret Oliphant believed that Anne \"would have no right to be considered at all as a writer but for her association with [her sisters'] imperative spirits.\" Mary Ward, a novelist, who was widely known for her anti-feminist views, in her introduction to 1900 edition of The Tenant, accused Anne of \"the narrowness of view\" and absence of \"some subtle, innate correspondence between eye and brain, between brain and hand, [which] was present in Emily and Charlotte.\" She concluded that \"it is not as the writer of Wildfell Hall, but as the sister of Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb, that Anne Bront\u00eb escapes oblivion.\" May Sinclair, while famously saying that \"when [Anne] slammed the door of Mrs Huntingdon's bedroom she slammed it in the face of society and all existing moralities and conventions,\" considered that she \"had no genius.\" Despite that, her opinion about The Tenant was unexpectedly high: \"There are scenes, there are situations, in Anne's amazing novel, which for sheer audacity stand alone in mid-Victorian literature, and which would hold their own in the literature of revolt that followed... Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Bront\u00ebs.\" In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel \u2014 while acclaiming it as \"the first presentment of that Feminist novel\", she stated that \"it bores to tears.\" Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: \"If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines.\" The only thing Sinclair wholly approved of was the author's treatment of marital laws of the time: \"Anne Bront\u00eb attacks her problem with a freedom and audacity before which her sisters\u2019 boldest enterprises seem cowardly and restrained...

Noting that The Tenant was published some ten years before George Eliot's novels, Harrison and Stanford named Anne the \"first realist woman writer\" in Great Britain. Unlike some early critics, who considered the scenes of debauchery improbable,Allott, The Brontes: The Critical Heritage, pp. 258\u2013259 Harrison and Stanford believed them to be \"described in a fashion which Zola might have admired.\" Winifred G\u00e9rin believed Helen Graham to be \"one of the first married women in fiction who is both competent and resolved to keep herself not by any of the accepted means as housekeeper, companion or governess, but as a painter, selling her canvasses to dealers.\" Despite this, in her later work on the Bront\u00ebs, G\u00e9rin dismissed The Tenant as being \"written too obviously as a work of propaganda, a treatise against drunkenness, to be considered a work of art.\" Several years later, however, G\u00e9rin wrote an introduction to The Tenant, where, while considering the framed structure in both The Tenant and Wuthering Heights a \"clumsy devise,\" acknowledged Anne's \"pre-eminent gift of story-teller\" and \"eloquence in proclaiming the equality of men and women.\" She believed that The Tenant \"might be said to be the first manifesto for 'Women's Lib'\". Inga-Stina Ewbank considered Anne the least talented of the sisters and claimed that the framing structure \u2013 where \"Helen can reveal her innermost being to the diary\" while Gilbert is \"bound to be as objective as possible\" \u2013 \"throws the novel out of balance.\" However, she believed that \"through the very nature of its central concern, The Tenant is feminist in the deepest sense of the word.\"", "In her early essays on Anne Bront\u00eb's novels and poetry Muriel Spark praised her proficiency. She believed that Charlotte was a \"harsh sister to Anne\" and \"had she taken an impartial view of Wildfell Hall, she must have discovered its merits.\" Despite notion that Charlotte and Emily were \"more gifted,\" Spark stated that \"[Anne's] writings none the less take no mean place in nineteenth-century literature.\" However, some forty years later, in the introduction to The Essence of the Bront\u00ebs, Spark radically changed her views on Anne: \"I do not now agree with my former opinion on Anne Bront\u00eb's value as a writer. I think her works are not good enough to be considered in any serious context of the nineteenth century novel or that there exists any literary basis for comparison with the brilliant creative works of Charlotte and Emily... She was a writer who could 'pen' a story well enough; she was a literary equivalent of a decent water-colourist.\"", "Only in the last decades of the 20th century The Tenant began to get critical acclaim. Elizabeth Langland in her 1989 monograph Anne Bront\u00eb: The Other One said: \"It is worth pausing briefly to reflect on what might have been Anne\u2019s fate had The Tenant of Wildfell Hall been re-published with Agnes Grey so that critics could re-acquaint themselves with Anne\u2019s greater novel and so that critics could take that opportunity to measure the substantial artistic growth between the two novels.\" Langland argued that the heroines in Anne's novels influenced those of Charlotte, and named Anne among the first women writers to adopt a woman as narrator. Langland concluded that \"if Charlotte Bront\u00eb was radical in claiming sexual identity for women, then Anne Bront\u00eb was radical in claiming professional identity for women.\" Robert Liddell, noting Anne's apparent distaste for Romantic tradition, claimed that The Tenant criticized both Branwell's life and Wuthering Heights. Edward Chitham in A Life of Anne Bront\u00eb (1991) also juxtaposed the novels of Anne and her sisters'. He stated that in Anne's view Wuthering Heights exhibited elements which she called in the preface to the second edition of The Tenant a \"soft nonsense,\" thus making \"almost an accusation against Emily.\" Unlike Chitham and Liddell, Maria H. Frawley identified the central element in The Tenant as the criticism of 19th century domestic ideology that encouraged women to \"construct themselves as ethereal angels of morality and virtue\". Betty Jay, analyzing Helen's marital experience, concluded that The Tenant \"not only demonstrates that the individual is subject to powerful ideological forces which delineate his or her place within culture and society, but that there are ways in which these forces can be subverted and resisted by those who suffer as a result.
