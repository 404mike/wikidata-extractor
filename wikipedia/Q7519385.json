He also represented England at Under 21 level, playing two matches in 1986.Morgan began his football career with Leicester City, representing them in the First and Second Divisions of The Football League, before being bought to then Third Division Fulham in October 1990 by Alan Dicks. The Cottagers finished 21st in Morgan's first season there (avoiding relegation by two points), and 9th in his second season (during which the club replaced Dicks with Don Mackay and missed out on the play-offs by four points) with a squad which Morgan felt \"should have got promoted but for one reason or another we blew it\". However, a 12th-placed finish in 1992/93 was followed by the club slipping to 18th with nine matches remaining of the 1993/94 season, as a result of which Mackay was replaced by Ray Lewington, and after going through these managerial changes, Fulham were relegated to the Third Division.After finishing within three points of the play-offs in 1994/95 under Ian Branfoot, the club had slipped to 23rd by February 1996, and eventually appointed Micky Adams as manager, who helped them finish 17th. The team was promoted to the Second Division in 1997. The club was then bought by Mohamed Al Fayed, which was followed by Fulham's rise into the Premier League in 2001. Due to injury, Morgan only played once in Fulham's victorious 2000\u201301 Division One campaign, coming on as a substitute against Wolverhampton Wanderers, which earned him the Man of the Match award despite playing only 13 minutes.Morgan was granted a testimonial year in the 2000\u201301 season. This included a special edition of Fulham fanzine TOOFIF, called \"There's Only One Simon Morgan\" (TOOSM), and culminated in a friendly match against Spurs, supported by a Fulham vs. Chelsea veterans' game (in which his son played). Morgan was unable to participate in the Spurs match due to injury, but kicked the match off before being shown a pre-arranged red card by referee Graham Poll.Morgan then went to play at Brighton & Hove Albion for a season, scoring once against Northampton, before bringing his playing career to an end in 2002. After retiring he rejoined Fulham as head of the club's community scheme. He left the club in 2007 to become the Premier League's Head of Community Development.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King Edward VI Five Ways School", "response": ["* Simon Morgan - former Leicester City F.C. and Fulham F.C. footballer"]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["Adams was clear about his ambitions at managing at a higher level, stating his disappointment at not being offered the management positions at either Southampton or West Ham United in the summer of 2001.

That signalled the start of the new era of Fulham. Adams was appointed as manager and oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of what little relegation danger was present (as it turned out, no team was even relegated from the league that season). The next campaign, he engineered a complete turnaround in form and his side, captained by Simon Morgan, finished second \u2013 only missing out on first place because the League had dropped the old \"goal difference\" to decide tied positions, system in favour of a \"goals scored\" tally. (While Fulham's goal difference was one better than that of champions Wigan Athletic, they scored 12 fewer goals.) This was somewhat ironic, as the club's then chairman Jimmy Hill had successfully argued that goals scored should decide positions of teams tied on points at the Football League's 1992 AGM."]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["|  Simon Morgan"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["By January Wolves were clear at the top, and Vale were comfortably placed in second. Vale narrowly beat Notts County and Chester City to give themselves some breathing space. On 18 January, Rudge agreed to sign a new two-year contract. However Vale began to struggle, as Bury and Cardiff City inflicted two straight losses. Yet a back injury forced Bob Hazell into retirement, whilst Ray Walker had trouble with his foot. More bad news came when loyal servant Phil Sproson retired on medical advice after sustaining a bad knee injury.  Rudge responded by trying to bolster his defence, but was unable to secure Steve Sims, Peter Swan, Simon Morgan, Chris Hemming, or Peter Skipper. Rudge then took the decision to sign classy defender Dean Glover from Middlesbrough for \u00a3200,000, as a replacement for Sproson. This more than quadrupled the club's previous transfer record. Andy Jones also agreed to join the club on loan to boost the club's promotion chances."]}]}}
