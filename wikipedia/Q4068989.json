Educated at a private school at Sheffield until he was 16, Moorhouse afterwards went to the People's College in the evenings. He was widely read and already taking an interest in theological and philosophical books. His father intended the younger Moorhouse to become a partner in his cutlery business, but after spending two or three years at this work, Moorhouse asked that he might be sent to a university with a view to ordination. He never regretted the years he spent in business, as he realised that the experience of men he had gained was invaluable. Moorhouse knew little Latin, and no Greek or higher mathematics, so there was much to be learned before at the age of 23 he was able to enter St John's College, Cambridge (graduated BA, 1853 as a senior optime in the mathematical tripos; MA, 1860; DD, 1876)."]}, {"page": "List of Old Paulines", "response": ["*James Moorhouse (1924\u20132014); politician"]}, {"page": "London South (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Moorhouse"]}, {"page": "London South and Surrey East (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"| James Moorhouse "]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*James Moorhouse \u2013 Conservative and Liberal Democrat MEP"]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|James Moorhouse"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2014", "response": ["*James Moorhouse, 90, British politician, Member of the European Parliament (1979\u20131999).James Moorhouse Obituary"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**James Moorhouse, 90, politician, Member of the European Parliament (1979\u20131999)."]}]}}
