After an abysmal 7\u201325 season in 1980, Chadwick brought Brian Kidd to the team on a loan from Bolton Wanderers F.C. While the team's prospect improved during the 1981 season, including increased attendance and a division championship, a lack of profitability led Turner to pull the plug on the team after that season.
