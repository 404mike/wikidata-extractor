His flying experience ranged from man carrying kites before the First World War to early jet fighters and helicopters. He designed, built and flew his own glider in the 1930s, designed 36 boats and yachts, and wrote many books describing his flying career and the history of British aviation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Westland Whirlwind (fighter)", "response": ["The engines were developments of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel K.26, later renamed Peregrine. The first prototype, L6844, used long exhaust ducts that were channelled through the wings and fuel tanks, exiting at the wing's trailing edge. This configuration was quickly changed to more conventional, external exhausts after Westland's Chief test pilot Harald Penrose nearly lost control when an exhaust duct broke and heat-fractured an aileron control rod.Bingham 1987, p. 28. The engines were cooled by ducted radiators, which were set into the leading edges of the wing centre-sections to reduce drag. The airframe was built mainly of stressed-skin duralumin, with the exception of the rear-fuselage, which used a magnesium alloy stressed skin.Bingham 1987, p. 57.Buttler 2004, p. 37. With the pilot sitting high under one of the world's first full bubble canopies and the low and forward location of the wing, all round visibility was good (except for directly over the nose). Four 20\u00a0mm cannon were mounted in the nose; the 600\u00a0lb/minute fire rate made it the most heavily armed fighter aircraft of its era.Moyes 1967, p.3. The clustering of the weapons also meant that there were no convergence problems as with wing-mounted guns. Hopes were so high for the design that it remained top secret for much of its development, although it had already been mentioned in the French press."]}, {"page": "RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)", "response": ["In 1938, the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by Westland Aircraft's chief test pilot Harald Penrose and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, howeverthe Ecclesiastical Commissioners of the Church of Englandrefused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered  of the land and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941 despite problems with poor drainage. A main runway of  and three subsidiary runways each of  had been constructed."]}, {"page": "Westland Wyvern", "response": ["The prototype W.34; the Wyvern TF.1, first flew at Boscombe Down on 16 December 1946 with Westland's test pilot Harald Penrose at the controls. This aircraft was lost on 15 October 1947 when the propeller bearings failed in flight. Westland's assistant test pilot Sqn. Ldr. Peter Garner was killed attempting to make an emergency landing. From prototype number three onwards, the aircraft were navalised and carried their intended armament."]}, {"page": "Roy Chadwick", "response": ["After the war, he designed Britain's first pressurised airliner, the Avro Tudor, based around the Lancaster-derivative Avro Lincoln, though few were built and also the Avro Shackleton in 1946. His final involvement with Avro was overseeing the initial designs of the Avro Vulcan (Avro 698) from 1946. Author Harald Penrose describes Roy Chadwick in \"British Aviation\" as \"Artistic with unbounded enthusiasm and unsparing energy, Roy Chadwick was a great designer of intuitive diagnostic ability rather than a scientist, yet like all great masters was in step with the tide of knowledge and contemporary outlook.\"   Chadwick was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1943 Birthday Honours for his contribution to the design of the Lancaster and in particular for the adaptations he made to it in preparation for the low-level attacks on the German dams, during the Dam Busters raid Operation Chastise. The same year he was granted the Honorary Freedom of the City of London."]}, {"page": "Nether Compton", "response": ["Harald Penrose (1904-1996), British test pilot and aviation author, lived in Nether Compton for more than 50 years in a house of his own design.Philip Jarrett, \"Obituary: Harald Penrose\", The Independent, 11 September 1996"]}, {"page": "W. E. W. Petter", "response": ["In May 1932 he was appointed personal assistant to the managing director, Robert Bruce, a position previously held by Petter's friend and colleague Harald Penrose.  Bruce did not welcome the appointment and ignored him, leaving Petter spare time to modify and compete an Austin 7.  Despite his interest in sports cars, Petter had no interest in learning to fly. Penrose gave him a flying lesson at this time, but later commented that Petter had a 'lack of the requisite sensitivity coupled with hopeless judgment of speed and distance'."]}, {"page": "Reaching for the Skies", "response": ["# \"Trail Blazers\": The film starts with a brief account of Charles Lindbergh's solo transatlantic flight, before examining other revolutionary achievements in aviation such as the first flight of the Concorde, the first Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown, the flight from Australia to England by Ross Macpherson Smith and Keith Macpherson Smith, the early Barnstormers and flying circuses that contributed to pilots developing their skills. An interview with Harald Penrose about flying with British barnstormer Alan Cobham is featured. The episode further discusses the circumnavigation of the Earth by air, such as the 1924 flight around the world by the United States Army Air Service using 4 Douglas World Cruisers. Early accounts from U.S. Air Mail pilots are included. Other pioneering flights mentioned in this episode include Cobham's flight to Capetown, South Africa, Richard E. Byrd's attempt to fly over the South Pole using a Ford Trimotor, Douglas Douglas-Hamilton's attempt to fly over Mount Everest, and the race to carry out the first non-stop flight from New York to Paris, for the Orteig Prize. Ren\u00e9 Fonck, Clarence Chamberlin, Richard E. Byrd, Charles Nungesser, and the team of Stanton Wooster and Noel Davis are noted, but Lindbergh was the first to successfully cross the Atlantic non-stop in 1927. His account of his historic flight is narrated. The subsequent rapid development of air travel in Europe and America is described, including Gore Vidal's account of his first transcontinental flight, the growth of Lufthansa, and Juan Trippe's attempts to dominate international air travel. The film ends with a narration from Charles Lindbergh's writings about the possible impact of aviation on the public."]}, {"page": "Westland PV.7", "response": ["The PV.7 was powered by a Bristol Pegasus IIIM3 engine within a Townend ring, which produced 722\u00a0hp (538\u00a0kW) and drove a two-bladed wooden propeller. It flew for the first time on 30 October 1933, with Harald Penrose, Westland's regular test pilot at the controls.  Early flights showed the need to glaze the cockpit and lighten the ailerons, and later tests at higher speed revealed that the wing twisted under aileron loads.  This latter problem required significant re-working of the wing structure, specifically the replacement of the inter-spar rods with torsionally stiffer tubes. Flight testing also showed that the rudder was aerodynamically over-balanced, causing oscillations cured by removal of the horn balance entirely."]}, {"page": "Penrose Pegasus", "response": ["The Penrose Pegasus was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, wooden glider from the UK.  Designed, built and flown by Harald Penrose until the start of World War II, only one was built at the time though a reproduction was constructed in the 1990s."]}, {"page": "Arthur Davenport (aeronautical engineer)", "response": ["When the Westland Aircraft Works was created by the Petter twins in 1915, Arthur was one of the first draughtsman to be recruited from Petter's Ltd . He was chief designer from 1919, working under the direction of Teddy Petter from May 1934  until 1944, when Petter left (to join English Electric)  and Davenport became technical director. According to Harald Penrose, he was made the scapegoat for the late delivery of the Wyvern and headed into retirement in March 1952."]}, {"page": "Westland CL.20", "response": ["Construction was completed in December 1934 and in January 1935 taxi-ing trials were carried out at Yeovil by Harald Penrose, after which it was transported to the Cierva flight test centre at Hanworth Aerodrome, where Juan de la Cierva flew the prototype on its first flight on 5 February 1935. During development flying, carried out by R.A.C. Brie, the CL.20 exhibited over-sensitive lateral control and was unable to exceed a height of . To improve lift, a more powerful Niagra engine was fitted but this made little difference."]}, {"page": "Edward Whitehead Reid", "response": ["* G-EBJT Westland Widgeon II. This had been the first prototype of the Widgeon I which was damaged at Lympne trials in 1926. Rebuilt as the Mk.II, it was delivered to Whitehead Reid from the Westland factory at Yeovil by their pilot, Harald Penrose on 5 January 1928. The doctor named the aircraft Wendy after his dog. The aircraft crashed on 19 October 1930 killing the doctor and his passenger (see below)."]}]}}
