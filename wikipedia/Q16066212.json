He converted his holding attack with the 3rd and 6th Divisions into a head on assault. The new assault began around 11:30 am. The British commander sent every available unit against the French right flank and center. He held back only 2/95th Foot and 3/95th Foot, the Portuguese 3rd Ca\u00e7adores Battalion and the 17th Line Infantry Regiment from the Light Division. The brigades of Ross and Vasconcellos were withdrawn and replaced by the 7th Division. The struggle for Saint-Bo\u00e8s broke out anew when Walker's division and William Anson's brigade of 4th Division attacked, supported by two British artillery batteries firing from the church knoll. Four battalions attacked in the center led by the 6th Foot. Two battalions were deployed to the left and John Milley Doyle's Portuguese brigade was on the right. Taupin's tired soldiers, who had been fighting for about four hours, were driven back behind the Plassotte knoll where they rallied."]}, {"page": "Carlow County (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir John Milley Doyle \t"]}, {"page": "Anna Wheeler (author)", "response": ["One of her brothers, Sir John Milley Doyle (1781\u20131856) was a commander of British and Portuguese forces in the Peninsular War and the War of the Two Brothers.Henry Morse Stephens, Doyle, John Milley from Dictionary of National Biography at Wikisource"]}, {"page": "Sir John Doyle, 1st Baronet", "response": ["*John Milley Doyle"]}, {"page": "Rosina Bulwer Lytton", "response": ["Rosina Doyle Wheeler's mother was the women's rights advocate Anna Wheeler, the daughter of the Rev.
