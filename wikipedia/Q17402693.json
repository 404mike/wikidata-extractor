Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by 'conscience'. Sigmund Freud described this as the result of a struggle between the ego and the superego\u00a0\u2013 parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of God as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider \"the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery.\"Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) pp. 390\u20131 For his later explicator, Lacan, guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of the Symbolic order.Catherine Belsey, Shakespeare in Theory and Practice (2008) p. 25"]}, {"page": "Structuralism", "response": ["A potential problem for a structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive; as scholar Catherine Belsey puts it: \"the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference.\"Belsey, Catherine. 1983. \"Literature, History, Politics.\" Pp. 17\u201327 in Literature and History 9. An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of West Side Story did not write anything \"really\" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a \"formula\" with a symbolic operator between them would be \"Boy + Girl\") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other (\"Boy's Group - Girl's Group\" or \"Opposing forces\") and conflict is resolved by their deaths. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two friendly families (\"Boy's Family + Girl's Family\") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other (\"Boy - Girl\") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed."]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 073 || Poststructuralism || Catherine Belsey ||  || || "]}, {"page": "Arden of Faversham", "response": ["* Catherine Belsey. \"Alice Arden's Crime.\" Staging the Renaissance.
