Since 2000, he has been Professor of English in the Faculty of English, University of Cambridge.John Kerrigan was born in Liverpool; he was educated there at St. Edward's College followed by Oxford, where he went to Keble, later becoming a Junior Research Fellow at Merton. \nSince 1982 he has taught at Cambridge where he is a fellow of St. John's College. He has lectured extensively in Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, and his publications on Shakespeare, early modern literature, and modern British and Irish poetry are internationally acclaimed.  In 2013 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy.  Visiting positions include UCLA, Auckland and Princeton.\nDuring the 1980s Kerrigan established himself as one of a group of scholars who revolutionised the editing of Shakespeare by discrediting the practice of 'conflating' variant early texts of such plays as Hamlet and King Lear, though his position, like that of others, has become more complicated over time. His own editions include Love's Labour's Lost (1982) and Shakespeare's Sonnets and A Lover's Complaint (1986). He did further work on A Lover's Complaint recovering its sources and analogues in Motives of Woe (1991). His recent Shakespearean output includes essays on 'The Phoenix and Turtle' (2013), an extensive analysis of the question 'How Celtic was Shakespeare?', and Shakespeare's Binding Language (2016).  His 2016 Oxford Wells Shakespeare Lectures were published in 2018 as Shakespeare's Originality.He won the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in 1998 for Revenge Tragedy: Aeschylus to Armageddon, an ambitious study in comparative literature, and in 2001 published a book of essays On Shakespeare and Early Modern Literature.\nOver the last couple of decades John Kerrigan has published numerous essays on contemporary poetry, including Seamus Heaney, Roy Fisher, Geoffrey Hill, Denise Riley, Eil\u00e9an N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in and Paul Muldoon.His Archipelagic English: Literature, History, and Politics 1603-1707 (2008) seeks to correct the traditional Anglocentric account of seventeenth-century English Literature by showing how much remarkable writing was produced in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and how preoccupied such English authors as Shakespeare, Milton, and Marvell were with the often fraught interactions between ethnic, religious, and national groups around Britain and Ireland. He has written extensively for the Times Literary Supplement (London) and the London Review of Books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carrie (novel)", "response": ["The novel deals with themes of ostracization, centering around Carrie being ostracized for not conforming to societal norms. A driving force of the novel is her first period in the shower leading to her being pelted with tampons and further scorned. Sue is one of the few people to feel genuine remorse for Carrie and arranges a date with Sue's fianc\u00e9, Tommy, for the Spring Ball. However, Chris's need for vengeance against Carrie results in pig blood being dumped on Carrie during the Spring Ball. This results in Carrie committing a massacre among the school and Chamberlain. Following the massacre, Sue is subject to the same exclusion as Carrie, despite her altruistic motives. John Kerrigan, a literary scholar, and Victoria Madden have observed that throughout the novel, Carrie is often associated with pigs, which are considered \"disgusting\" animals."]}, {"page": "Peter Robinson (poet)", "response": ["Peter Robinson's earliest published poetry was fortunate to receive numerous notices, including one in which the poet and novelist James Lasdun observed that \u2018he is a poet, and one with a sensibility which, if attuned only to a somewhat limited range of experience, is unusually refined\u2019 in Siting Fires 1 (1983). The best of these early reviews was Eric Griffiths\u2019 in PN Review 35 (1983), which described Robinson as \u2018in my judgement, the finest poet of his generation\u2019. The publication of This Other Life (1988) brought his work to the attention of the national press for the first time with Martin Dodsworth in the Guardian (Friday 13 May 1988) describing the book as \u2018grave and deliberated\u2026beautiful and mysterious too\u2019, Rachel Billington's singling it out in the Financial Times (20 Feb 1988), and its being named a \u2018Book of the Year\u2019 in the Sunday Telegraph (4 Dec 1988). Stephen Romer described it as \u2018love poetry of an exemplary kind\u2019 in the Times Literary Supplement (19 Aug 1988) and John Kerrigan found in it \u2018a miracle of balance\u2019 in the London Review of Books (13 Oct 1988).", "*The Thing About Roy Fisher: Critical Studies (Liverpool University Press: 2000) with John Kerrigan "]}, {"page": "Sonnet 11", "response": ["Quatrain 3 takes on a slightly different path in addressing to the Youth. It speaks of nature and how she gave more to those who already had so much and little to those who already had nothing (this example can be found in the Synopsis). As definitions of certain words have changed from their meanings in the sixteenth century, an explanation of their original content is needed to understand quatrain 3 in its entirety. One of these words is 'store', which Hammond points out that within the context of the line means, \"The breeding of animals\". This supports the theme of the sonnet in its wish of the Youth to have a child. Another expansion on this quatrain further explores nature giving more to those whom she's already gifted and how John Kerrigan sees this as being similar to Matthew's paradox in Matt. 25:29 (Bible verse). The comparison comes from the line saying, \"For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: But he that hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that which he hath\". Kerrigan finds that line 11 is a good shadow of this line from Mathew (New Testament). This quatrain is able to bring out the sort of beliefs in the idea of beauty and power in the time of Shakespeare."]}, {"page": "Sonnet 15", "response": ["John Kerrigan states flatly \"[t]he line is not Alexandrine; influence has two syllables; and comment is accented on the first syllable, producing a feminine ending.\""]}, {"page": "John Kerrigan", "response": ["John Kerrigan may refer to:", "*John Kerrigan, one of several noms de plume of Charles Whiting (1926\u20132007), British novelist and historian", "*John Kerrigan (literary scholar) (born 1956), professor of English at Cambridge University", "*John Kerrigan (New York City) (born 1851), New York politician"]}, {"page": "Sonnet 25", "response": ["The meter demands a few variant pronunciations: line 3's \"favourites\" functions as 3 syllables, and line 9's \"warrior\" as 2 syllables. The final -ed is syllabic in line 7's 3-syllable \"buri\u00e8d\", line 9's 3-syllable \"famous\u00e8d\" and line 11's 2-syllable \"raz\u00e8d\". Stephen Booth notes that the original typography suggests that the final rhymes may have been intended to be trisyllabic: \"belov\u00e8d\" and \"remov\u00e8d\", although other editors (like John Kerrigan) prefer the standard 2-syllable pronunciations.", "Shakespeare refers to the influences of astrology and fate in this poem. Stars are cited as the luck-giving ones that favor some with positions at court. The reference made to the \"favour of the stars\" is also a metaphor for the members of the court keeping in favour of the King. Because courtly status is gifted by the stars and not earned, it is precarious. John Kerrigan notes the echo of the prologue to Romeo and Juliet in the astrological metaphor of the first quatrain; he notes that the image severs reward from justice, making fortune a mere caprice."]}]}}
