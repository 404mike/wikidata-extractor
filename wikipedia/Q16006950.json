Though born in Hastings, Sussex, he played club cricket for Carlton, Edinburgh, Blyth, Ashington and Morpeth, as well as four first class matches for Scotland between 1949 and 1950. In football, he featured as a Goalkeeper for Crystal Palace, Albion Rovers, Heart of Midlothian, Cowdenbeath, Raith Rovers, Morton and Montrose. In cricket, he was a right-hand batsman who made a best of 81 in his first-class career, but in a non-first class match against the Australian 1948 Invincibles he top-scored with 49 for Scotland. He died in Totnes, Devon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted better than in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool, promoted to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (1949), pp. 260\u2013261. Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball, and the wickets were shared, with nobody taking more than four."]}, {"page": "Thomas Roland Crosskey", "response": ["#redirect Tom Crosskey"]}]}}
