She claimed to be able to treat drug addiction using electric shocks, something she called \"neuro-electric therapy\" (NET). The reputation gained by NET was based on celebrity endorsements, but there is no evidence that it is an effective treatment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Who", "response": ["The Who released two studio albums with Jones as drummer, Face Dances (1981) and It's Hard (1982). Face Dances produced a US top\u00a020 and UK top ten hit with the single \"You Better You Bet\", whose video was one of the first shown on MTV. Both Face Dances and It's Hard sold well and the latter received a five-star review in Rolling Stone. The single \"Eminence Front\" from It's Hard was a hit, and became a regular at live shows. By this time Townshend had fallen into depression, wondering if he was no longer a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson."]}, {"page": "Pete Townshend", "response": ["The \"large clinic\" Townshend was referring to was a plan he and drug rehabilitation experimenter Meg Patterson had devised to open a drug treatment facility in London; however, the plan failed to come to fruition.
