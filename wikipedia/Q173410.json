He drove in a single Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, racing a Cooper.\nPrior to Formula One, he was one of the leaders of the British Formula Junior scene, but an accident at Rouen-Les-Essarts in 1958, in which he broke his collarbone, considerably hampered his career. He continued racing, and competed in a Formula Two (F2) Cooper-Climax entered by Alan Brown at the 1959 British Grand Prix at Aintree. He finished in 12th position, third of the F2 cars and six laps down. From there he drove a Formula Junior Lola and many small-engined sports cars, winning his class in the 1960 and 1962 1000km N\u00fcrburgring. He retired in 1962.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 16", "response": ["*1934 \u2013 Peter Ashdown, English race car driver "]}, {"page": "1959 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Peter Ashdown", "|  Peter Ashdown"]}, {"page": "1959 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Peter Ashdown", "|align=\"left\"|  Peter Ashdown"]}, {"page": "Alan Stacey", "response": ["Stacey competed successfully in many sports car races driving Lotus cars, initially as a private entrant in his own car and later for Team Lotus.

On the back of this record Broadley, at the request of a number of drivers seeking something besides a Lotus XI, immediately began to design a chassis to accept a more powerful 1098cc (67ci) Coventry Climax engine and BMC A-series gearbox. This car, with its up-to-the-minute space frame chassis, was to become the Lola Mk1, named after the song \"Whatever Lola Wants\" from the contemporary musical Damn Yankees. Although, as Broadley freely admits, the Mk1 was too powerful for his level of driving skill , in 1958 he became the first man ever to lap the Brands Hatch Indy circuit in under one minute. Once it was sorted it beat the Lotus XIs \"with monotonous regularity\" (notably in the hands of Peter Ashdown, who racked up at least a score of wins, including a class win and sixth overall at the 1959 Tourist Trophy. The success soon attracted the interest of other privateers, so Broadley and his cousin were prevailed upon in 1958 to build three further copies.
