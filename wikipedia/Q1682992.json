Bercow has become the first ex-Speaker since the retirement of Arthur Onslow in 1761 to have been eligible for, but not have been made the offer of, a peerage. Overall, he is the tenth Speaker not to receive a Peerage since the 1707 Act of Union, and the fifth since Onslow's retirement not to be immediately elevated to the House of Lords: Charles Wolfran Cornwall died in office with no peerage offer to his surviving family, John Henry Whitley was offered but declined, and following the deaths of Edward Fitzroy and Sir Harry Hylton-Foster in office, their widows were ennobled instead."]}, {"page": "Board of Governors of the BBC", "response": ["*John Henry Whitley (1930)"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1910\u20131936)", "response": ["*John Henry Whitley (1866\u20131935)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Rt Hon.
