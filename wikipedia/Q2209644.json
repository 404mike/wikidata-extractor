He got thirty replies and formed a group called \"Lunch\". He met Dave Kaffinetti in November 1968, and together they formulated the basic ideas for Rare Bird. In August 1969, they finally found the ideal rhythm section in Steve Gould, Chris Randall and Mark Ashton. Field and Kaffinetti had originally envisaged that the band would be a four-piece and were looking for a singer/bass player. Gould and Randall, who had both previously been members of the Pop-Psych band \"Fruit Machine\", applied to the advert as vocals/guitar and bass respectively and were taken on. Lunch played a few gigs; one notable one was at the Tilbury Working Mens Club for the princely sum of five pounds. The band had no van and they managed to get amps, drums, guitars and Hammond organ into their cars. The gig was marred by Randall receiving a bad electric shock whilst on stage. It later turned out that the founders of the band were more interested in Steve Gould and convinced him to play bass. Randall was now high and dry and was kicked out of the band.", "* Mark Ashton \u2013 drums, tympani, backing vocals", "* Mark Ashton \u2013 drums, backing vocals", "*Mark Ashton Project Web Site", "*Mark Ashton Vey Art Web Site"]}, {"page": "Bob Weston (guitarist)", "response": ["* Mark Ashton \u2013 Solo (1979)"]}, {"page": "Mark Ashton", "response": ["In his memory, the Mark Ashton Trust was created to raise money for individuals living with HIV, and  it had raised \u00a320,000.

Ashton's role in the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners group was recalled in a series of interviews with some of its other members prior to the film's release. However, Ashton's membership in the Young Communist League was not explicitly mentioned in the film, possibly to avoid alienating American audiences. Fellow communist activist and a close friend of Mark Ashton, Lorraine Douglas, accused the film of having \"glossed over Mark's politics and said nothing about the fact he subsequently became General Secretary of the YCL\", the youth wing of the Communist Party of Great Britain.", "On 25 September 2018, the Council of Paris awarded the garden adjoining the H\u00f4tel d'Angoul\u00eame Lamoignon the new name of  (H\u00f4tel-Lamoignon - Mark Ashton Garden), in his memory."]}, {"page": "Terry Wilson (musician)", "response": ["In the early 1970s he started as a professional musician, playing bass for bands/artists like Blackwell, Bloontz, John Martyn amongst others.
