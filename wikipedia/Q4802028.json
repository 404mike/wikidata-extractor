Ruhma takes Besa to The Mill in secret, and gives her a scan, where it is confirmed her baby is in breech, so Ruhma persuades her to go to hospital. Ruhma tells Besa that she needs an episiotomy in order to protect her during the birth, and that she will need somebody to oversee the surgery. However, Besa does not want anybody else to be in the room due to her fear of being deported, so asks Ruhma to do it alone. The baby is delivered safely, and Besa begins staying in a hostel. When Home Office learn that Besa is in England illegally, they take her in for questioning. She explains to the immigration officers that she has experienced female genital mutilation at the age of 12, was repeatedly raped by a gangster in her city and, as a result, fell pregnant. She also explains how her family shamed her when she explained she was pregnant and tried to force her into a sham marriage.
