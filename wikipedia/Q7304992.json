According to Huddle, \"it remained just an idea until August 1976\", when Eric Clapton made a declaration of support for former Conservative minister Enoch Powell (known for his anti-immigration Rivers of Blood speech) at a concert in Birmingham. Clapton told the crowd that England had \"become overcrowded\" and that they should vote for Powell to stop Britain from becoming \"a black colony\". He also told the audience that Britain should \"get the foreigners out, get the wogs out, get the coons out\", and then he repeatedly shouted the National Front slogan \"Keep Britain White\". Saunders, Wreford and Bruno, who were members of the agit-prop theatre group, Kartoon Klowns, together with Huddle, responded by writing a letter to NME expressing their opposition to Clapton's remarks. They claimed these were all the more disgusting because he had a hit with a cover of Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\": ", "Musicians not only played for RAR, many took part in organising gigs and clubs. For instance, in Leeds, Gang of Four, The Mekons and Delta 5 were all actively involved in their local RAR group, as were Au Pairs and The Beat in Birmingham, and Misty In Roots and The Ruts in Southall, London.
