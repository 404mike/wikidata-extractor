He played centre for the Leicester Tigers and, between 1909 and 1913, won four caps for England, scoring two tries. He also earned three Blues while reading law at Oxford.\nHe later became a solicitor in Leicester before volunteering for overseas service during the First World War. He was killed in July 1915 near Ypres on the Western Front, after being hit by a shell splinter while serving as a lieutenant in the 1/4th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment. Tarr was one of 27 former England internationals killed in the war.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ronald Poulton", "response": ["Poulton's reputation as a rugby player preceded him at Oxford, but he knew before he arrived at Balliol in October 1908 that it was going to be difficult to get into the Oxford side, whose back line was filled with exceptional players. The only vacancy was given to Colin Gilray, who was a little older and arrived from New Zealand with a strong reputation. In his first term, Poulton played several games for Oxford, at first on the wing but then at centre. The penultimate fixture before the Varsity Match of 1908, was against Blackheath on 28 November. Being so close to the game against Cambridge, it was something of a trials match, and Poulton had a bad game at right centre. So Harold Hodges, Oxford's captain, opted for the centre pairing of Vassall and Frank Tarr, which had proven itself in 1906 and 1907.", "Although he had missed selection for the Varsity match, Poulton was called up to play at centre for England, alongside Frank Tarr, against France on 30 January 1909. As yet, France was not part of what was to become the Five Nations Championship, and was a relatively easy side to beat, England coming away with a 22\u20130 victory. Tarr scored two tries that day, but was dropped from the team, only playing once more for England in 1913. Poulton, however, was kept on to play the remaining Championship games against Ireland and Scotland."]}, {"page": "1909 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["England: John Jackett (Leicester), Edgar Mobbs (Northampton), Frank Tarr (Oxford University), EW Assinder (Old Edwardians), BB Bennetts (Penzance), J Davey (Redruth) TG Wedge (St. Ives), JG Cooper (Moseley), Robert Dibble (Bridgwater & Albion) capt., WA Johns (Gloucester), AL Kewney (Leicester), AD Warrington-Morris (US Portsmouth), FG Handford (Manchester), H Archer (Guy's Hospital), ET Ibbitson (Headingley)", "England: John Jackett (Leicester), Edgar Mobbs (Northampton), Frank Tarr (Leicester), Ronnie Poulton-Palmer (Oxford University), T Simpson, F Hutchinson (Headingley) RH Williamson, CA Bolton, Robert Dibble (Bridgwater & Albion) capt., WA Johns (Gloucester), AL Kewney (Leicester), AD Warrington-Morris, FG Handford (Manchester), H Archer (Guy's Hospital), ET Ibbitson (Headingley)"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|476||Frank Tarr||centre ||1909-01-09||v Australia at Blackheath"]}, {"page": "July 1915", "response": ["* Died: Frank Tarr, British rugby player, centre for the England national rugby union team from 1909 to 1913 (killed in action at the Second Battle of Ypres (b. 1887)"]}, {"page": "Francis Nathaniel Tarr", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Tarr"]}, {"page": "Poulton's Match", "response": ["|RC ||Frank Tarr||RC ||J.
