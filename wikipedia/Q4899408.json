An example of one of these questions would be \"Name a US State\" (duplicate answers are disallowed). Contestants giving correct answers will have a go at picking a number on the Treasure Island board. The board has a photograph of an island printed on it and has 36 square panels. Behind each panel hides a sum of money. There are 10 lots of \u00a3100, 10 lots of \u00a3200, 10 \u00a3250s, 4 lots of \u00a3500, one \u00a31000 and one \u00a32000 square to be uncovered. The highest sums of money (\u00a3500, \u00a31000 and \u00a32000) also give the winner a chance at unlocking The Mint. This game also involves a group of 5 live contestants that differ each night (for example, 5 male lifeguards or 5 hairdressers). After a few phone contestants have had a go at the Treasure Island board, the contestants in the studio have to answer the same question and guess a number from 1-36 on the board. These live guests can win money and also have the chance of unlocking The Mint if they win one of the higher amounts. Clues are also given in this game after a while, such as \"Think South\" meaning to pick numbers on the lower half of the board. Once the \u00a32000 has been uncovered the game ends. If this doesn't happen for a set-time, the game ends after a certain number of calls have been taken (normally between 10-14 calls).
