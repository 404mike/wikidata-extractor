He then scored four more goals by the end of 2009, scoring against Rotherham United, Bradford City, Cheltenham Town and Morecambe. However, Schumacher suffered injuries on four separate occasions throughout the 2009\u201310 season. Despite this, he continued to remain in the first team for the club.

Westwood left Kettering by mutual consent in January 2011, and was granted permission to train at his former club Crewe Alexandra. The managing staff were impressed with his fitness levels and rewarded him with a short-term contract, keeping him at the club until the end of the season.

His first Villa appearance came eight days later when he replaced Charles N'Zogbia as a substitute in the 62nd minute of a goalless draw with Newcastle United at Villa Park. He made his first start for the club in their 3\u20130 home defeat against Arsenal on 20 September, after illness had ruled out some of his teammates. On 11 April 2015, he was sent off for two yellow cards as the team won 1\u20130 away to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, causing him to miss their victory over Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final eight days later. S\u00e1nchez scored his first goal for Villa on 25 April, an 85th-minute deflected volleyed equaliser away to title holders Manchester City, but Fernandinho later netted a winner for City.

When an injury ruled Vlaar out, Nathan Baker came into the back four, with Clark remaining on the bench. After injuries to both Baker and Senderos, Clark was called on along with Jores Okore and formed a solid partnership. Clark scored his first goal of the season from a free-kick curled in by Ashley Westwood in a 2\u20131 home victory over Leicester."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["Stevenage hosted Crewe Alexandra in the first weekend of September, which resulted in a 1\u20131 draw. Crewe were forced to wear Stevenage's yellow away strip after the referee deemed their current away kit to clash with the red and white of Stevenage. Stevenage took the lead just before the interval, Yemi Odubade tapping the ball into the net after Stacy Long's initial shot had rebounded off of the post. Crewe equalised ten minutes into the second-half, Ashley Westwood scoring from just outside the area. The home side were reduced to ten men just minutes later as Long was sent-off for two bookable offences. A week later, Stevenage lost their second league game of the season, losing 1\u20130 to Cheltenham Town at Whaddon Road. The following game, Stevenage drew 0\u20130 at home to Torquay United \u2013 who had sat at the top of the table before the start of the match. Stevenage won their first away game of the season against Lincoln City, winning 1\u20130 at Sincil Bank. New loan signing Chris Holroyd scored the only goal of the game just before half-time, lashing the ball high into the roof of the net after Charlie Griffin had brought down Darius Charles' throw-in. First-team coach Dino Maamria was also listed as a substitute, but was unused. Three days later, Stevenage recorded their second away win of the campaign, beating Hereford United 4\u20131. Stevenage opened the scoring after thirteen minutes, Chris Holroyd latching onto Lawrie Wilson's cross to give the visitors a one-goal lead going into the interval. However, just four minutes into the second-half Hereford restored parity through Sean Canham. On the hour mark, the away side led once again, Jon Ashton heading home Wilson's corner to score his first goal of the season. Stevenage doubled their advantage just seven minutes later, Chris Holroyd scoring from six yards out. Holroyd completed his hat-trick with ten minutes remaining; Peter Vincenti broke down the right, squared the ball to Holroyd who composed himself before scoring his fourth goal in two games."]}, {"page": "Granit Xhaka", "response": ["On 28 August 2020, Xhaka was in the starting 11 in the 2020 FA Community Shield, which Arsenal clinched a 5\u20134 victory over Liverpool in the penalty shootout after the match was 1\u20131 after 90 minutes.

The Gulls scored two second half goals through Billy Bodin and Lee Mansell, meaning that Luke Young's first Argyle goal was nothing but a consolation in a 2\u20131 defeat. With the January transfer window now open, Argyle confirmed the permanent signings of Nick Chadwick and Darren Purse, who had previously only been on loan from Stockport County and Millwall respectively, as well as signing former youth goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth from Bideford. Crewe Alexandra won all three points when Argyle travelled to Gresty Road, a brace from Luke Murphy and a penalty scored by Ashley Westwood meant that Simon Walton's penalty and Matt Lecointe's second goal of the season were once again, nothing but consolations. Conor Hourihane was sent off late on in the game for two bookable offences, which was Argyle's tenth and final red card of the season, whilst first team coach Kevin Nancekivell was sent to the stands."]}]}}
