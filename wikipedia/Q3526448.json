Jardine contributed three fifties in four innings in the series, scoring 221 runs at an average of 73.66. He scored 60, 61 and 65 before his final Test innings ended at 35 not out. Jardine scored 831 first-class runs on the Indian leg of the tour\u2014he played one match in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)\u2014averaging 55.40. Although Jardine enjoyed the tour, there were still clashes evident. There was an argument with the Viceroy over Jardine selecting the Maharaja of Patiala to play for the M.C.C. in one match; in a subsequent match, Jardine complained that the pitch was rolled for too long. He also clashed, later on, with the umpire Frank Tarrant, initially due to suspicion over the number of lbw decisions given against the M.C.C., but also because Tarrant had warned him against using Bodyline and was employed by Indian princes. Jardine threatened to stop him umpiring and sent a telegram to Lord's, with the result that Tarrant, having officiated the first two Tests, was not used in the third.Douglas, pp. 182\u201383.Frith, p. 393. For much of the time, Jardine used different tactics to those employed in Australia. Slow bowling, particularly that of Hedley Verity, played a key part in the bowling attack. At times, the faster bowlers Nobby Clark and Stan Nichols bowled Bodyline, resulting in several injuries. In this case, the Indian bowlers Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh retaliated with Bodyline bowling of their own.Frith, pp. 391\u201392.Douglas, p. 176."]}, {"page": "England cricket team", "response": ["England's following tour of India in the 1933\u201334 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent.

Their bowlers conceded over 40 runs a wicket in 1928 \u2013 about the highest ever with uncovered pitches. The emergence of Jack O'Connor, Stan Nichols and when available, the amateur fast bowlers Ken Farnes and Hopper Read, though, made Essex during the 1930s a dangerous if inconsistent side. They finished as high as fourth in 1933, and owing to their pace bowling maintained almost as high a standard up to the outbreak of war. The batting, however, tended to depend too much upon O'Connor and a number of amateurs who were rarely available, and Essex lost too many games to break the North's stronghold on the Championship.", "* Stan Nichols", "|Stan Nichols|| 1,608"]}, {"page": "Learie Constantine", "response": ["Although not as fast as he had been on the previous tour, Constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling. However, the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics, and Constantine took one for 55; England's captain Douglas Jardine, who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia, batted for five hours to score his only Test century.Frith, pp. 356\u201358. The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental in turning English attitudes against Bodyline,Douglas, pp. 167\u201368. something Constantine considered hypocritical. In the West Indies' second innings Constantine's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn.Howat (1976), p. 104. Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test, with Essex all-rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine's substitute for the club team. When Jardine heard, he convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test, the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play.Frith, p. 364. Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain. In all first-class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20.11 and took 14 wickets at 22.14."]}, {"page": "Bombay Gymkhana", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| 2 || Stan Nichols ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || Won"]}, {"page": "Morris Nichols", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stan Nichols"]}, {"page": "Stanley Nichols", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stan Nichols\ufffd"]}, {"page": "Morris Stanley Nichols", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stan Nichols"]}, {"page": "M.S.

The first dismissal came in after English bowler Allom had dismissed two New Zealand batsmen with his previous two deliveries; after Tom Lowry and Ken James, Badcock's wicket completed Allom's only Test hat-trick.   Lowry had only faced two balls, Allom having bowled Stewie Dempster immediately beforehand, to take four wickets in five balls.  Badcock fared slightly better with the ball.
