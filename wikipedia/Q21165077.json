His discovery was widely reported including in Scientific American and Science which coined the memorable 'Newton was no sap' strap line. In 2010, he wrote a piece for Nature discussing theoretical analyses revealing how plant investment in the architecture of leaf veins can be shuffled for different conditions, minimising the construction costs associated with supplying water to leaves. He placed these findings in the context of the pioneering English plant physiologist Stephen Hales's book Vegetable Staticks published in 1727. Hales observed that plants lose water by \"perspiration\" and then went one better by conducting experiments to quantify the process."]}, {"page": "Plant, Cell & Environment", "response": ["The journal was established in 1978 by editor-in-chief Harry Smith (University of Nottingham), together with Paul Gordon Jarvis (University of Aberdeen), David Jennings (University of Liverpool), John Raven (University of Dundee), and Bob Campbell (Blackwell Scientific)."]}]}}
