Since 2002, he has been consultant urologist to Guy's Hospital, and in 2009 became the first professor of robotic surgery and urology at King's, and subsequently the chairman of the King's College-Vattikuti Institute of Robotic Surgery.\nEarly in his career, he was a medical research fellow to Clare Fowler at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen's Square, where they developed an outpatient procedure for treating urinary incontinence in people with an overactive bladder that did not respond to usual medical treatment. They were the first in the UK to use this method of injecting Botox into the bladder wall using a flexible cystoscope, and it subsequently became known as the \"Dasgupta technique\".\nIn 2005, he led the team that used a da Vinci robot to perform one of the early keyhole operations to retrieve a kidney as part of a kidney transplant, in Britain. Ten years later, he successfully removed a cancerous tumour from a mans prostate using a 3D-printed replica prostate as an aid to surgery.\nFrom 2013 to 2020 he was editor-in-chief of the urology journal British Journal of Urology International (BJUI). His awards include the Fellowship of King's College in 2018 and St Peter's Medal from the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) in 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dasgupta", "response": ["* Prokar Dasgupta, urologist"]}, {"page": "Roger Kirby", "response": ["* ABC of Prostate Cancer.

Her work has also included looking at capsaicin instillation into the bladder in managing urinary incontinence due to an overactive bladder. Capsaicin did not receive a licence for treatment, but Botox did."]}]}}
