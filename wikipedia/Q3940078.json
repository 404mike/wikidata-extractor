The side conceded just 32 goals during the 1999\u20132000 season, largely due to the form of excellent centre-back pairing Jason Smith and Matthew Bound, as well as keeper Roger Freestone. During the season the side set a record of nine consecutive league victories, and, during the same period, seven consecutive clean sheets. Striker Walter Boyd also set an unwanted record of being the fastest substitute ever sent off, when he was red-carded for striking a Darlington player seconds after being brought on and before play had resumed, therefore being officially recorded as zero seconds.", "Wilfred Milne holds the record for Swansea appearances, having played 586 matches between 1920 and 1937, closely followed by Roger Freestone with 563 between 1991 and 2004.

Cutler played 43 times in 2001\u201302 helping the team reach the 2002 Football League Second Division play-off Final where they beat Brentford 2\u20130 to gain promotion to the First Division. He remained as first-choice going into the 2002\u201303 season but lost his place once Tony Pulis became manager in November 2002. In March 2003 he joined Swansea City on loan as cover for injured goalkeeper Roger Freestone. He played in the next 13 league games culminating in a superb performance against Hull City on the final day of the season which kept the Swans in the Football League. Cutler was back at Stoke for the 2003\u201304 season where he was back-up to Ed de Goey and made 16 appearances as the Potters finished in 11th position."]}, {"page": "1968 in Wales", "response": ["*19 August \u2013 Roger Freestone, footballer"]}]}}
