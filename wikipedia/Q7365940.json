He played as a winger.\nMorris was born in Birmingham. He began his football career as one of the first intake of boys to the Football Association's School of Excellence at Lilleshall which opened in 1984, from where he joined Birmingham City as a YTS trainee in 1986. He was capped for England schoolboys, and made his Birmingham debut in the Second Division on the last day of the 1987\u201388 season, coming on as substitute for Tommy Williams in a goalless draw at home to Leeds United. Morris turned professional in September 1988 and made 14 appearances in all competitions, mostly as a substitute, in the 1988\u201389 season, but the club cancelled his contract following incidents at the training ground. An attempt to revive his career in Italy foundered when he was discovered to have signed for his new club after the transfer deadline, and Morris returned to England and joined non-league club Redditch United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ronnie (name)", "response": ["*Ronnie Morris, musician with the Canadian indie rock band controller.controller", "*Ronnie Morris (footballer) (born 1970), English former professional footballer", "*Ronnie Morris (rugby union) (1913-1983), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Ron Morris", "response": ["* Ronnie Morris, musician with the Canadian indie rock band controller.controller", "* Ronnie Morris (footballer) (born 1970), English former professional footballer", "* Ronnie Morris (rugby union) (1913\u20131983), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Ronnie Morris"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Ronnie Morris"]}]}}
