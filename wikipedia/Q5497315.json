In January 1907, he made a singing tour of Germany which included Berlin, Munich, Leipzig, Frankfort, and Cologne, giving recitals with Fanny Davies (a celebrated pupil of Clara Schumann's). He sang mixed programmes, but his performance of German lieder, and especially of Brahms, in German, was greatly admired.  He was then singing such songs as Komm bald, Am Sonntag Morgen, Salamander, Ein Wanderer, Wir wandelten, Auf dem Kirchhof, Magyarisch, Die Kr\u00e4nze, St\u00e4ndchen, and Botschaft.W. & R. Elwes (1935), pp. 172\u20135. He sang the Brahms Liebeslieder in Brussels in 1908 with Marie Brema, and in London gave a recital with Paderewski.W. & R. Elwes (1935), pp. 181\u20133. In January 1913 at the Queen's Hall, under Henry J. Wood, he sang Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde in company with the contralto Doris Woodall: Wood thought it 'excessively modern but very beautiful'.H. J. Wood, My Life of Music (Gollancz, London 1946 edn), p. 287. Brahms remained central to Elwes's repertoire to the end, and he also performed lieder of Grieg, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and George Henschel. Early in his career he found an ideal accompanist in Frederick B. Kiddle, and they remained associated until his death."]}, {"page": "St Marylebone Parish Church", "response": ["* ????-1913 \u2013 Frederick B.
