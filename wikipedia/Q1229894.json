He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear. In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\".

Pericles did not appear in it at all.\"The Brotherton First Folio Digital Resource\", University of Leeds, retrieved 9 December 2014 In 1875, when Dowden argued that Shakespeare's late comedies should be called \"romances,\" he did so because they resemble late medieval and early modern \"romances,\" a genre in which stories were set across the immensity of space and time. The romances have grand plot points which are combined with humour, dramatic action and internal struggles.Lyne, pp. 6 and 99 They also feature broader characters, larger spectacles and a different handling of the themes of appearance and reality.Smith, Hallett \"Shakespeare's Romances\" Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 3, Shakespeare (May 1964), pp. 279\u2013287  The late romances differed from early Shakespearean comedies by relying on grand themes, rather than specific moments.

Seven years later the folio volume Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories & Tragedies appeared; this edition is now called the First Folio. It contains 36 plays, 18 of which were printed for the first time. Because Shakespeare was dead, the folio was compiled by John Heminges and Henry Condell (fellow actors in Shakespeare's company), and arranged into comedies, histories and tragedies.  The First Folio is generally looked to by actors and directors as the purest form of Shakespeare's text.

William Aspley and John Smethwick participated in the endeavor as subsidiary partners. It contained, in addition to blandishments provided by various admirers of Shakespeare, such as the dedication signed by \"John Heminge and Henry Condell\", 36 plays. They included Troilus and Cressida, which was not, however, listed in the table of contents, but omitted Pericles and The Two Noble Kinsmen, which are now usually considered canonical.William Thomas Lowndes, The Biographer's Manual of English Literature## (London, rev. ed. by Henry G. Bohn, 1890) vol. 8, pages 2253-2255. The Jaggards were printers, and did the actual printing of the book. The elder Jaggard has seemed an odd choice to many commentators, given his problematical relationship with the Shakespeare canon: Jaggard issued the suspect collection The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599 and 1612, and in 1619 printed the so-called False Folio, ten pirated or spurious Shakespearean plays, some with false dates and title pages. It is thought that the printing of the First Folio was such an enormous task that the Jaggards' shop was simply needed to get the job done. William Jaggard was old, infirm, and blind by 1623, and in fact died a month before the First Folio was complete.Halliday, pp. 169\u201371, 249\u201350, 355\u20136."]}, {"page": "Titus Andronicus", "response": ["Perhaps the most frequently discussed topic in the play's critical history is that of authorship.

Additionally, John Heminges and Henry Condell felt sure enough of Shakespeare's authorship to include it in the First Folio in 1623.

Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published.
