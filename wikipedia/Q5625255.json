The single and the label were funded by a loan of \u00a3400 from Dr. Feelgood's Lee Brilleaux. The label's first EP was Lowe's 1977 four-track release Bowi, apparently named in response to David Bowie's contemporaneous LP Low.

In 1977 he produced Dr. Feelgood's album, Be Seeing You, which included \"That's It, I Quit\", written by Lowe.
