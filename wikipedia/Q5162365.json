He was born at Dundee in 1836. He became at an early age a student of the Royal Scottish Academy, and exhibited his first picture of importance, Queen Mary resigning her Crown at Loch Leven Castle, in the Exhibition of 1861; but this was surpassed in later years by The Raid of Ruthven. In 1863 he settled in London, and from that time onward was busily engaged with portraiture, which he varied with landscapes and genre subjects of interest and merit. Some of his most important portraits are those of the Earl and Countess of Dufferin, Admiral Grenfell, Alderman Sir William McArthur, Dr. Lorimer, and John Faed, R.S.A.. He died suddenly at his residence in St John's Wood, London in 1882.5", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fyfe", "response": ["* William Baxter Collier Fyfe (1836\u20131882), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "William Fyfe", "response": ["*William Baxter Collier Fyfe (1836\u20131882), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "William B.
