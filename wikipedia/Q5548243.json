The eldest daughter of a judge, her lack of wealth and social connections earned the disapproval of the 2nd Marquess of Salisbury; despite this, Alderson married his son Robert in 1857.\nThough the marriage was happy and grew to include eight children, Robert and Georgina's first years together were pinched financially. To supplement their income, Lady Georgina aided her husband as he contributed political articles to various newspapers. Their circumstances improved when Lord Robert became his father's heir in 1865, and in 1868 he inherited the Salisbury title. She hosted parties and receptions at Hatfield House and in London that aided his political career in the Conservative Party.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen", "response": ["At London, on 8 April 1853, George Stephen married his first wife, Annie Charlotte Kane (1830\u20131896). She was one of several children born to Benjamin Kane on the Adriatic island of Corfu when the Ionian Islands were a British protectorate. Her father, a former officer in the Royal Engineers was assistant clerk of works in the Naval Ordnance there, though she was educated in London. During a Royal Tour, the haemophiliac Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, fell seriously ill at Montreal and Charlotte nursed him back to health. As such, in 1887, she was first presented to Queen Victoria by her friend Georgina Gascoyne-Cecil, Marchioness of Salisbury, who lived at Hatfield House which neighboured the Stephen's home from 1893, Brocket Hall.
