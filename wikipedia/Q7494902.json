He was the official biographer of Sir John Gielgud and wrote biographies of many other theatrical figures he had known, including No\u00ebl Coward.

Coward and Gertrude Lawrence played the lead roles, Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne. Victor is a secondary character, along with Sybil Chase; the author called them \"extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again\". To make them credible spouses for Amanda and Elyot, Coward was determined that two outstandingly attractive performers should play the parts. Olivier played Victor in the West End and then on Broadway; Adrianne Allen was Sybil in London, but could not go to New York, where the part was taken by Esmond. In addition to giving the 23-year-old Olivier his first successful West End role, Coward became something of a mentor. In the late 1960s Olivier told Sheridan Morley:"]}, {"page": "An Inspector Calls", "response": ["A revival of the play by British director Stephen Daldry (produced by PW Productions) opened at the National Theatre's Lyttelton Theatre in September 1992. Daldry's concept was to reference two eras: the 1945 post-war era, when the play was written, and the ostensible historical setting for the work in pre-war 1912; this emphasised the way the character Goole was observing, and deploring, the Birling family's behaviour from Priestley's own cultural viewpoint. It won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Play, and was widely praised for making the work involving and politically relevant for a modern audience. The production is often credited with single-handedly rediscovering Priestley's works and \"rescuing\" him from the reputation of being obsolete and class-bound, although the production had some detractors, including Sheridan Morley who regarded it as a gimmicky travesty of the author's patent intentions. The success of the production since 1992 has led to a critical reappraisal of Priestley as a politically engaged playwright who offered a sustained critique of the hypocrisy of English society. A Broadway transfer of the production starring Philip Bosco opened at the Royale Theatre (now the Bernard Jacobs Theatre) on 27 April 1994 and played 454 performances."]}, {"page": "Sheridan", "response": ["*Sheridan Morley (1941\u20132007), British broadcaster and writer"]}, {"page": "The Prisoner of Zenda", "response": ["* The Prisoner of Zenda (1937): Starring Ronald Colman as Rassendyll and Rudolph, Madeleine Carroll as Princess Flavia, Raymond Massey as Michael, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Rupert of Hentzau, C.\u00a0Aubrey Smith as Colonel Zapt and David Niven as Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim.

As Sheridan Morley later reported: \"At first she thought they were joking. She had never done a musical and she has an unusual croaky voice which sounds as if she has a permanent cold. So frightened was she of singing in public that she auditioned from the wings, leaving the pianists alone on stage\". But when it opened at the Palace Theatre in February 1968, Frank Marcus, reviewing for Plays and Players, commented that: \"She sings well. The title song, in particular, is projected with great feeling.\""]}, {"page": "Wendy Hiller", "response": ["In 1984 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester. In 1996, Hiller was honoured by the London Film Critics Circle with the Dilys Powell Award for excellence in British film.

But as Sheridan Morley perceptively remarked in 2000, when reviewing Nicholas Wright's Cressida: \"Gambon's eccentricity on stage now begins to rival that of his great mentor Richardson\". Also like Richardson, interviews are rarely given and raise more questions than they answer. Gambon is a very private person, a \"non-starry star\" as Ayckbourn has called him. Off-stage he prefers to stay out of the limelight. While he has won screen acclaim, his ravaged King Lear at Stratford, while he was still in his early forties, formed a double act with a red-nosed Antony Sher as the Fool sitting on his master's knee like a ventriloquist's doll."]}, {"page": "Michael Hordern", "response": ["Throughout his 1993 autobiography A World Elsewhere, Hordern exhibited his pride on being able to play a wide range of parts, something which made him a frequent subject among theatrical critics. The author Martin Banham thought that many of Hordern's characters shared a general identity of \"an absent-minded, good-hearted English eccentric\".Banham, p. 497. The American journalist Mel Gussow, writing in Hordern's obituary in The New York Times in 1995, described the actor as being \"a classical actor with the soul of a clown\", while the actors John Hurt and Michael Bryant described Hordern as being \"the Austin Princess among British actors\",\"Sir Michael Hordern obituary\", The Times, 4 May 1995, p. 23. which implied to the author Sheridan Morley that Hordern possessed an element of \"reliability but [with] a faint lack of charisma\".

In the same year No\u00ebl Coward chose Gielgud as his understudy in his play The Vortex. For the last month of the West End run Gielgud took over Coward's role of Nicky Lancaster, the drug-addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother. It was in Gielgud's words \"a highly-strung, nervous, hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion\".Gielgud (1979), p. 61 He found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself, but he thought it \"a thrilling engagement because it led to so many great things afterwards\"."]}, {"page": "1941 in literature", "response": ["*December 5 \u2013 Sheridan Morley, English biographer and critic (died 2007)"]}, {"page": "The Relapse", "response": ["During the first half of the 20th century The Relapse was relatively neglected, along with other Restoration drama, and experts are uncertain about exactly when Vanbrugh's original again resurged to prominence on the stage and thereby marginalised Sheridan's version.

Following Donald Sinden's outstanding and award-winning performance at the Aldwych Theatre in the mid-1960s Vanbrugh's original play is now again a favourite of the stage. A 2001 revival by Trevor Nunn at the National Theatre was described by Sheridan Morley as \"rare, loving and brilliantly cast.\" As so often with commentary on The Relapse, Morley focused on the role of Lord Foppington and its different interpretations: \"Alex Jennings superbly inherits the role of Lord Foppington which for 20 years or so belonged to Donald Sinden, and for another 20 before that to Cyril Ritchard.\"Sheridan Morley, \"Company Pride\", 28 July 2001, review in The Spectator."]}, {"page": "Helen Mirren", "response": ["At the beginning of 1989, Mirren co-starred with Bob Peck at the Young Vic in the London premiere of the Arthur Miller double-bill, Two Way Mirror, performances which prompted Miller to remark: \"What is so good about English actors is that they are not afraid of the open expression of large emotions. British actors like to speak. In London, there\u2019s a much more open-hearted kind of exchange between stage and audience\" (interview by Sheridan Morley: The Times 11 January 1989). In Elegy for a Lady she played the svelte proprietress of a classy boutique, while as the blonde hooker in Some Kind of Love Story she was \"clad in a Freudian slip and shifting easily from waif-like vulnerability to sexual aggression, giving the role a breathy Monroesque quality\" (Michael Billington, The Guardian)."]}, {"page": "Chess (musical)", "response": ["The premiere of the musical provoked an overall mixed to favourable verdict from the critics and, according to Variety, created \"one of the bigger West End mob scenes in recent memory\".

The Daily Telegraph wrote that the show was \"gift-wrapped and gorgeous...compels admiration\", The Times noted that \"it turns out to be a fine piece of work that shows the dinosaur mega-musical evolving into an intelligent form of life\" and Today called it \"gripping, eye-catching.. nearly a major triumph\".
