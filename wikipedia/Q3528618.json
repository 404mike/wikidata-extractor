The series was called the Prudential Trophy and the teams had 55 overs each per innings. Botham, still only 20, was the youngest player. At Scarborough, England captain Alan Knott lost the toss and Clive Lloyd, captaining the West Indies, elected to field first. Botham was number seven in the batting order and came in at 136 for five to join Graham Barlow. He scored only one before he was caught by Roy Fredericks off the bowling of his future Sky Sports colleague Michael Holding. England's innings closed at 202 for eight with Barlow 80 not out. West Indies lost Fredericks almost immediately but that brought Viv Richards to the crease and he hit 119 not out, winning the man of the match award, and leading West Indies to victory in only 41 overs by six wickets. Botham had the consolation of taking his first international wicket when he had Lawrence Rowe caught by Mike Hendrick for 10. He bowled only three overs and took some punishment from Richards, his return being one for 26."]}, {"page": "March 26", "response": ["*  1950   \u2013 Graham Barlow, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Michael Holding", "response": ["According to an urban myth, during a Test match between the West Indies and England when Holding was to bowl to English player Peter Willey, the BBC radio commentator at the time, Brian Johnston, described the action as \"The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey\" (a double entendre, as \"willy\" is British English slang for a penis). However Wisden states that there is no record of Johnston or anyone else actually saying this (although a colleague of Johnston's, Henry Blofeld, has said he recalls the incident occurring during a Test match at The Oval in 1976.) In a limited-overs international between England and West Indies on 26 August 1976 at Scarborough, Michael Holding's return from long-leg deflected off the nearer wicket, breaking the bails, and then scuttled along the pitch to also break the far wicket, with Graham Barlow and Alan Knott, on his only appearance as England's captain, stranded in mid-pitch. This highly unusual occurrence of both wickets being broken by one throw dumbfounded the umpires, David Constant and Arthur Jepson, who rejected the run-out appeal for reasons that still remain obscure, given the undertones of the Test series and the nationality of the umpires (neutral umpires were not introduced until 1994) bias, racial or otherwise, might be considered. The West Indies played 26 first-class matches on the tour, winning 18 and losing only 2, making them the most successful side ever to tour England."]}, {"page": "Wilf Slack", "response": ["When Mike Brearley, Middlesex captain and batsman, was recalled to the England side in 1981, Slack was called on to replace Brearley and open the batting for Middlesex against Kent at Lord's; he scored his maiden first-class century, 181 not out. The unbroken stand of 367 by Slack and his partner (Graham Barlow) was a Middlesex record. In the following game he made 248 not out, against Worcestershire; both were scored in the second innings. He finished the season with 1,303 Championship runs at 48.25. This auspicious opening with Barlow foreshadowed their profitable partnership, one of the best opening pairs in the County Championship circuit of that era, until Barlow retired in 1986, which along with domestic problems affected Slack's form. Slack completed 1,000 runs in a season eight times. In 1985 he bettered his effort of four years earlier by making 1,900 runs at 54.28, and was rewarded with a tour of Sri Lanka with the England B side."]}, {"page": "West London College", "response": ["* Graham Barlow, cricketer"]}, {"page": "North Enfield Cricket Club", "response": ["Other prominent professional cricketers that have associations with North Enfield are Mike Smith of Middlesex and England, whose family was involved at North Enfield for many years, staged a benefit game at North Enfield in 1976 .John Emburey, the Middlesex and England spin bowler, who played in the North Enfield Centenary game against MCC and Benefit 1986 and Graham Barlow (Benefit fixture 1983).
