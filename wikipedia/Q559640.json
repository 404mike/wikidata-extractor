He arrived in New Zealand in 1866 to join an uncle in the West Coast goldfields. His prominence in local politics gained him a seat in the House of Representatives in 1879. Seddon became a key member of the Liberal Party under the leadership of John Ballance. When the Liberal Government came to power in 1891 Seddon was appointed to several portfolios, including Minister of Public Works.\nSeddon succeeded to the leadership of the Liberal Party following Ballance's death in 1893, inheriting a bill for women's suffrage, which was passed the same year despite Seddon's opposition to it. Seddon's government achieved many social and economic changes, such as the introduction of old age pensions. It also purchased vast amounts of land from the M\u0101ori. An imperialist in foreign policy, his attempt to incorporate Fiji into New Zealand failed, but he successfully annexed the Cook Islands in 1901. Seddon's government supported Britain with troops in the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902) and supported preferential trade between British colonies. Seddon was the second New Zealand head of government to die in office (after his predecessor, Ballance).\nIn office for thirteen years, Seddon is to date New Zealand's longest-serving head of government. Sometimes derisively known as \"King Dick\" for his autocratic style, he has nonetheless been lauded as one of the greatest, most influential, and most widely known politicians in New Zealand history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Agrarianism", "response": ["The New Zealand Liberal Party aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912).

That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.\"  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The Liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state such as old age pensions and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it extended voting rights to women, making New Zealand the first country in the world to do so."]}, {"page": "June 10", "response": ["*1906 \u2013 Richard Seddon, English-New Zealand politician, 15th Prime Minister of New Zealand (b. 1845)"]}, {"page": "June 22", "response": ["*  1845   \u2013 Richard Seddon, English-New Zealand politician, 15th Prime Minister of New Zealand (d. 1906)"]}, {"page": "Politics of New Zealand", "response": ["In 1882 the export of meat in the first refrigerated ship started a period of sustained economic export-led growth.
