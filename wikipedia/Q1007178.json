He served as Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin 1964-1966. In 1952, he gave a sufficient condition for a graph to contain a Hamiltonian circuit. The previous year, he conjectured that n points in the plane, not all collinear, must span at least \n  \n    \n      \n        \u230a\n        n\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n        \u230b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor }\n   two-point lines, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u230a\n        x\n        \u230b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lfloor x\\rfloor }\n   is the largest integer not exceeding \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  .
