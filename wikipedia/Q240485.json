When Katona went home to tell her mother about the band, her mother's friend was unable to pronounce \"Automatic Kitten\" and kept saying \"Atomic Kitten\". Katona liked the name and told her bandmates about it; they all felt the same way and the name stuck. Range later quit because of artistic differences and was replaced by Natasha Hamilton.

In 2000 they recorded a cover of \"The Locomotion\" for the movie Thomas and the Magic Railroad. The album, also titled Right Now, was first released in Japan on 16 March 2000 and released in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2000 following the release of two further singles, \"I Want Your Love\" and \"Follow Me\", with a slightly modified tracklist.
