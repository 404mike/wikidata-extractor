For example, The Blue Lagoon (1980) shows the awakening of the sexual instinct in two shipwrecked young cousins \u2013 one male, one female \u2013 on a tropical island where nudity is a natural part of the environment in which they find themselves. The relationship between a painter and his model, who traditionally poses in the nude, is the context of a number of films. In La Belle Noiseuse (\"The Beautiful Liar\", 1991) the painter's model motivates him again after a period of lack of inspiration of the artist. Similarly, in Titanic (1997) Kate Winslet poses nude for Leonardo DiCaprio. These films show the close relationship between film and the traditional art nude in art in films such as The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), where Uma Thurman poses as Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, and Goya in Bordeaux (1999), where Maribel Verd\u00fa poses as Goya's The Naked Maja. There are film scenes where nudity, in routine and non-sexual situations, such as mixed shower scenes, has been used to emphasize gender equity in the future, as in Starship Troopers. Another example of the practice involves scenes with a nude swim, also called skinny-dipping, such as Kelly Brook and Riley Steele in Piranha 3D. Toplessness in film is regarded by some as partial nudity, such as Halle Berry in Swordfish."]}, {"page": "Tony Jordan", "response": ["In 2008, he worked on Hustle and zombie drama Renaissance, starring Kelly Brook and Alan Dale.
