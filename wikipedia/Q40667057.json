In the third round, he hit his 3rd televised 9 darter, and the first at the World Championship for five years. Despite the feat, he went on to lose the match 4\u20132 to Stephen Bunting. James made his first final at the UK Open since winning the event a decade earlier in 2011, defeating the likes of Ryan Joyce, Rob Cross, Gabriel Clemens, Simon Whitlock and world champion Gerwyn Price en route. James won his 3rd UK Open title of his career defeating Luke Humphries in the final. The title was James' 11th major of his career, becoming only the second player in PDC history to win major titles in 3 different decades after Phil Taylor. The title also ensured Wade's return to the top 4 on the Order of Merit for the first time in 9 years. James was originally left out of the 2021 Premier League Darts but ended up replacing Gerwyn Price who tested positive for coronavirus on opening night and subsequently pulled out of the tournament. Wade failed to win any of his 3 opening matches of the Premier League before beating Michael van Gerwen 7\u20133 on night 4. Wade's form improved in the second week of the tournament, hitting 3 consecutive 105 averages in defeating the likes of Peter Wright and Jonny Clayton. Wade ultimately finished 6th in the Premier League, defeating Gary Anderson on the final night of the league stage.
