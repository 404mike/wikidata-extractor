He took part in the 1929 Scottish Cup Final in which Killie claimed the trophy by beating Rangers, and in the 1932 final, a defeat to the same opposition after a replay. He then fell out of favour and spent most of the 1932\u201333 season at Morton, but was then re-signed by Kilmarnock and finished his career there.Two other players named Hugh Morton, both also from the Newmilns / Darvel area, featured for Kilmarnock in the 1900s but neither was a close relative, nor was teammate John Morton (a goalkeeper).", "link_mentions": {}}}
