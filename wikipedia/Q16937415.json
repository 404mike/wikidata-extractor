He then fell out of favour and spent most of the 1932\u201333 season at Morton, but was then re-signed by Kilmarnock and finished his career there.Two other players named Hugh Morton, both also from the Newmilns / Darvel area, featured for Kilmarnock in the 1900s but neither was a close relative, nor was teammate John Morton (a goalkeeper).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1931\u201332 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RH ||||Hugh Morton"]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RH ||||Hugh Morton"]}, {"page": "Hugh Morton", "response": ["Hugh Morton may refer to:", "* Hugh Morton (actor)  (1903\u201384), English actor", "* Hugh Morton (footballer)  (born 1902), Scottish footballer of the 1920s and 1930s", "* Hugh Morton, Baron Morton of Shuna (Hugh Drennan Baird Morton, 1930\u20131995), Scottish lawyer and judge.", "* Hugh Morton (photographer) (Hugh MacRae Morton, 1921\u20132006), American photographer and nature conservationist", "* C.
