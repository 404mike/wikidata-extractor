He subsequently joined Bolton Wanderers for whom he only made two appearances; ironically, his debut for Bolton came at Everton on 5 November when he stood in for Wanderers regular keeper Charlie Harrison. The match report in The Liverpool Mercury said \"The visitors brought a strong eleven including Gillan (sic) who was to have kept goal for the home club this season.\" Another match report said that Gillam \"defended his charge in marvellous fashion, accounting for shot after shot in a style that brought forth hearty cheers\"; despite his efforts, Everton won the match 2\u20131. His only other Football League appearance came in a 5\u20132 defeat at home to Preston North End, who were to go through the season undefeated."]}, {"page": "Charlie Harrison (footballer born 1861)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlie Harrison (footballer, born 1861)"]}]}}
