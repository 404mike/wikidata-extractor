Speaking about \"My Town\" following its April 2021 release, Carter stated that it was about \"our collective mental health falling apart\" under lockdown, further elaborating that \"it's easy to dissociate when it's someone else's problem but we are each responsible for keeping the streets clean, looking out for our fellow neighbors and acting with kindness and respect as we walk through life. We can look into this town and see the seedy underbelly, the dirt, the disdain, the undercurrent of hate and despair. And then we are reminded that 'My Town' looks just like yours, and no one gives a fuck at all and if we don't start looking after ourselves soon then we are all going to be in big trouble.\" ", "The first single from the album was \"My Town\", released on 27 April 2021. The track features a verse sung by Idles' frontman Joe Talbot, who features in the song's music video and also joined Carter and the rest of the band onstage to perform the song at the Download pilot in June 2021. The eponymous second single was released on 4 July, receiving its debut radio play on Dan P. Carter's BBC Radio 1 show the same day.
