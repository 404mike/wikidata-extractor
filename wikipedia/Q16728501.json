In 1979, two women's colleges, Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's, reciprocated by admitting men as undergraduates, while St Hugh's, which was already employing male college lecturers, decided to admit men as Fellows. Resistance to full co-education was led by those who predicted that it would have severely negative effects on women academics and who saw other advantages in women\u2019s colleges. Admitting men as undergraduates was first proposed to the governing body in 1980, and there was a majority for it, but it did not secure the required two-thirds majority. The college principal, Rachel Trickett, fought off full co-education at St Hugh's for some years, even taking her case to the national newspapers, and it was not finally agreed until 1986.Laura Schwartz, A Serious Endeavour: Gender, Education and Community at St Hugh's, 1886-2011 (Profile Books, 2011),  pp. 114\u2013118 When Trickett retired in 1991, she was succeeded by the first male Principal, Derek Wood.Schwartz (2011), p. 22", "|Derek Wood"]}, {"page": "Derek Wood", "response": ["Derek Wood may refer to:", "* Derek Wood (author) (1930\u20132003), author of The Narrow Margin and books about aviation", "* Derek Wood (British Army soldier), British Army corporal killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army", "* Derek Wood (footballer) (born 1959), Scottish footballer", "* Derek Wood (barrister), principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford 1991\u20132002"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of University College, Oxford", "response": ["* Derek Wood"]}, {"page": "Derek Wood (lawyer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek Wood (barrister)"]}]}}
