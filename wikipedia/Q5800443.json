Banks said she is excited about Joey joining the soap, adding: \"There are so many places they can take them all.\" David Witts, who plays Alice's brother Joey, said that Joey is \"very protective\" towards Alice. Speaking about Joey's relationship with Alice, Witts said: \"It's a lovely relationship between Joey and Alice. The dynamic is quite an unusual one, because Joey became a father figure to his sister at a very young age once he became the man of the house.

Walford's creepiest couple could be on the cards!\" They made him their joint third favourite for the affair, along with Ray, and later said that an affair between Kat and Derek would be \"very believable\" but \"more than a little bit gross\", noting that Derek is on a power trip and Kat loves to be dominated and as there is more to the affair than physical attraction, there would be a \"strong chance\" it would be Derek. Julie Emery of Heat said of the affair, \"Our money's on Derek. What a couple they'd make...\"", "Digital Spy wondered if there could be a further twist where one of the five named suspects is not the culprit, as the BBC said there would be \"at least\" five. Soaplife added Joey Branning (David Witts) as a wild card, saying, \"there hasn't been a good soap toyboy storyline in we can't remember how long. And when they're done and done good, they're very, very good. It would actually be the one affair we'd understand Kat's motivation for.\" Jacqueline Jossa, who plays Max's daughter Lauren Branning, said that the cast were so \"desperate\" to know who Kat's lover was that she tricked them into believing it was Peter Andre, saying, \"No one at all knows who Kat's having the affair with, we're all talking about it on set. Some people have started winding other people up saying they've been told but they won't say who it is. I started a rumour around the set that it would be a celebrity guest appearance. I said it would be Peter Andre and some of the new cast believed it as well!\" However, Digital Spy reported that episodes in September 2012 would make it \"pretty much certain\" that Kat's lover is one of the named suspects.
