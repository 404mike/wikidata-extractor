The Spanish-language \"label brag\" \"Gucci Balenciaga\" includes the explicit lyrics \"me importa una mierda\" (Spanish: \"I don't give a shit\"), and is followed by the title \"Heartbreaker\", which InfoMusic's Alex St\u0103nescu picked as the album's highlight, noticing its oriental influences as well as the use of a synthesizer and vocal chopping. While Stern likened \"Sunset Dinner\" to American recording artist Britney Spears' \"Change Your Mind (No Seas Cortes)\" off her 2016 studio album Glory, he praised \"Thicky\" as \"stand[ing] out above the rest\".
