Saturday 11 February 1792 saw the first of Samuel Harrison and Charles Knyvett's Vocal Concerts, a series that would continue until 1821. Between 1845 and 1858, John Ella's Musical Union gave eight concerts a year of chamber music in the rooms. Hector Berlioz was on the podium at the rooms on 7 April 1848 when he conducted his \"Hungarian March\" from La damnation de Faust at a concert of the Amateur Musical Society.

Benjamin Cooke, the organist of Westminster Abbey, turned down young Busby (at age 12-13) as too old for a chorister; he was placed under Samuel Champness for singing, and Charles Knyvett for the harpsichord. Subsequently he studied under Jonathan Battishill."]}, {"page": "John Feltham Danneley", "response": ["The second son of George Danneley, a lay clerk of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and his wife Elizabeth, he was born at Wokingham, Berkshire, into a family who had come down in the world. His first musical instruction was from his father, and at the age of 15 he studied thorough bass with Samuel Webbe and the pianoforte under Charles Knyvett, and then Charles Neate. He is also said to have had some lessons from Joseph Woelfl, presumably later, as Woelfl only settled in England in 1805."]}, {"page": "Samuel Harrison (singer)", "response": ["Harrison was principal tenor at the Concerts of Antient Music from 1785 until 1791, when he withdrew, and with Charles Knyvett the elder, established the Vocal Concerts. The first was given on 11 February 1792 at Willis's Rooms, and they continued until 1794, when they had ceased to attract; Harrison and the chief promoters of the enterprise then returned to the Antient Concerts. In 1801 the Vocal Concerts were revived on a larger scale, with an orchestra, and were very successful until newer musical attractions drew the public away."]}, {"page": "Thomas Vaughan (singer)", "response": ["In 1811 he joined Charles Knyvett in establishing vocal subscription concerts, in opposition to the Vocal Concerts; but on the death of Samuel Harrison in 1812 the two enterprises were merged, and Vaughan became principal tenor soloist at all the prominent concerts and festivals. He sang at the Three Choirs Festivals from 1805 to 1836, and took part in the British premi\u00e8re of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in 1825. For twenty-five years the public recognised in him the typical faultless singer of the English school, perfected by the study of oratorio music."]}, {"page": "Vocal Concerts", "response": ["The Vocal Concerts were established by Charles Knyvett and Samuel Harrison; they were singers who had both performed at the Concerts of Antient Music.

One newspaper report stated that there were \"a hundred instruments and twice a hundred voices\". The only choirs officially mentioned are those of the abbey and the Chapel Royal but it is likely that the choir of St Paul's Cathedral was also present and that professional singers were hired-in. Large choirs of this size were fashionable at that time, especially for popular concerts of Handel's works. The conductor was William Shield and the organist was Charles Knyvett of the Chapel Royal.Range 2012, p. 197"]}, {"page": "Charles Smith (singer)", "response": ["In 1798 Smith was articled to John Ashley, and in the following year was engaged to sing at Ranelagh Gardens, the Oratorio, and other concerts. In 1803 he went on tour in Scotland, but, his voice having broken, he dropped singing temporarily, and devoted himself to teaching and organ-playing: he acted as deputy for Charles Knyvett and John Stafford Smith at the Chapel Royal and for James Bartleman at Croydon Chapel. On Bartleman's retirement, Smith was appointed organist there; but shortly afterwards he went to Ireland with a theatrical party as tenor singer, and on his return, a year later, he became organist of the Welbeck Chapel in succession to Charles Wesley junior."]}]}}
