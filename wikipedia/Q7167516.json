His total of 496 County Championship matches for Essex is a record for an amateur player in English cricket.\nA tall batsman who initially relied on driving for most of his runs, Perrin developed into a reliable player with virtually all the strokes. He and Charles McGahey, a similarly tall amateur, played together for Essex for many seasons and were known as the \"Essex Twins\". Perrin was the better batsman: he scored 1,000 in 18 seasons and in his long career made 29,709 runs at an average just short of 36 runs per innings.  He scored 66 centuries, the third highest number \u2013 after John Langridge and Ken McEwan \u2013 of any player who never played Test cricket.\nPerrin's biggest innings was a huge unbeaten 343, made out of an Essex total of 597 against Derbyshire at Chesterfield in 1904, which is the highest innings ever played by a batsman in a losing team.Another record statistic from that innings, the 68 fours hit, gives a clue why Perrin was never selected for Test cricket, or even for one of the representative matches such as Gentlemen v Players: he was slow in the field and not a good runner. On the strength of that innings, though, he was picked as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the almanack for 1905.\nApparently a shy man, Perrin captained Essex only occasionally, serving happily under his friends McGahey and Johnny Douglas and deputising for them when needed. But in retirement, Perrin's knowledge and his availability led him to become an England selector in 1926 and later from 1930 to 1939, chairing the committee in the last year. When E. M. Wellings asked Douglas Jardine about how he regarded the selectors, Jardine replied, \"We used to let Percy Perrin in the dressing-room, but he used to sit at the end of the balcony and keep quiet; but we wouldn't let any of the others in.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 26", "response": ["*1876 \u2013 Percy Perrin, English cricketer (d. 1945)"]}, {"page": "1904 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Bernard Bosanquet, Ernest Halliwell, James Hallows, Percy Perrin, Reggie Spooner"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Percy Perrin"]}, {"page": "Perrin", "response": ["*Percy Perrin (1876-1945), English cricketer, played for Essex"]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 68 (68 fours) || Percy Perrin (343*) ||Essex v Derbyshire at ChesterfieldEssex won the toss and batted first, scoring 597 including 343* from Percy Perrin.
