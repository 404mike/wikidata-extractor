During the First World War Godal ran a training school for actors. He became a leading independent producer of British films after the war, becoming managing director of the small but ambitious British & Colonial, based at Walthamstow Studios from 1918 to 1924. He later became involved with plans to make colour films at the newly built Elstree Studios and a proposed big-budget adaptation of an H.G. Wells novel, neither of which came to anything. His producing career largely ended with the arrival of sound in 1929, and he made only one further film, in 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British films of 1938", "response": ["|Chips || Edward Godal || Robb Wilton, Davy Burnaby || Musical ||"]}, {"page": "The Audacious Mr. Squire", "response": ["The Audacious Mr. Squire is a 1923 British silent comedy film directed by Edwin Greenwood and starring Jack Buchanan, Valia and Dorinea Shirley.
