She joined a touring cast of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1925 to 1927, playing the contralto roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. She then appeared in a musical adaptation of The Rose and the Ring in the West End for two holiday seasons and toured in Australia and New Zealand in Gilbert and Sullivan. She returned to D'Oyly Carte from 1931 to 1936 and was so popular in the company's visit to New York City in 1934 that US fans petitioned for her return to America.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
