In this and subsequent papers, they presented a model of this phenomenon predicting the existence of boundary vector cells that would respond at a specific distance from barriers in the environment. Several years later, this explicit theoretical prediction was supported by extensive experimental data demonstrating boundary cells with the predicted properties in the subiculum and the medial entorhinal cortex (where they are sometimes referred to as border cells)."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2017", "response": ["# Neil BurgessNeil Burgess | Royal Society"]}]}}
