A former Roman Catholic religious sister, she went from a conservative to a more liberal and mystical Christian faith. She attended St Anne's College, Oxford, while in the convent and majored in English. She left the convent in 1969. Her work focuses on commonalities of the major religions, such as the importance of compassion and the Golden Rule.\nArmstrong received the US$100,000 TED Prize in February 2008. She used that occasion to call for the creation of a Charter for Compassion, which was unveiled the following year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gautama Buddha", "response": ["The ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the Jain scriptures, and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in Indian history for which significant accounts exist. British author Karen Armstrong writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure. Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of \"birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death\" must be true."]}, {"page": "Jihad", "response": ["* \"Fighting and warfare might sometimes be necessary, but it was only a minor part of the whole jihad or struggle,\" according to Karen Armstrong."]}, {"page": "Muhammad", "response": ["According to traditional sources, Aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to Muhammad,D.

She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such as a hadith about the age difference between Aisha and her sister Asma, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens at the time of her marriage."]}, {"page": "Monotheism", "response": ["According to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as \"the Adamic religion\", or, in the terms of Andrew Lang, the \"Urreligion\". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an evolutionary progression from animism via polytheism to monotheism, but by 1974, this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent. Austrian anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt had postulated an Urmonotheismus, \"original\" or \"primitive monotheism\" in the 1910s. It was objected that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism. More recently, Karen Armstrong and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with animism, which developed into polytheism, which developed into henotheism, which developed into monolatry, which developed into true monotheism."]}, {"page": "Meaning of life", "response": ["The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies that explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the Charter for Compassion, signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the golden rule of 'treat others as you would have them treat you'.  The Charter's founder, Karen Armstrong, quotes the ancient Rabbi Hillel who suggested that 'the rest is commentary'.   This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation, and ritual are the means by which religious people internalize and live the golden rule."]}, {"page": "November 14", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Karen Armstrong, English author and academic"]}, {"page": "Parsifal", "response": ["In addition to a number of staged performances available on DVD, Parsifal was adapted for the screen by Daniel Mangran\u00e9 in 1951 and Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg in 1982.

Acceptance of asceticism emerged in Sufism slowly because it was contrary to the sunnah, states Nile Green, and early Sufis condemned \"ascetic practices as unnecessary public displays of what amounted to false piety\". The ascetic Sufis were hunted and persecuted both by Sunni and Shia rulers, in various centuries. Sufis were highly influential and greatly successful in spreading Islam between the 10th and 19th centuries, particularly to the furthest outposts of the Muslim world in the Middle East and North Africa, the Balkans and Caucasus, the Indian subcontinent, and finally Central, Eastern, and Southeast Asia. Some scholars have argued that Sufis, Muslim mystics, played a decisive role in converting the Mongol invaders in Persia to Islam during the 13th and 14th centuries, mainly because of the similarity between the extreme, ascetic Sufis (fakirs and dervishes) and the shamans of the traditional Turco-Mongol religion."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Karen Armstrong (born 1944), British religious"]}, {"page": "St Anne's College, Oxford", "response": ["*Karen Armstrong (born 1944), author."]}, {"page": "Millennials", "response": ["Globally, religion is in decline in North America and Western Europe, but is growing in the rest of the world. Political and religious demographer Eric Kaufmann told CNN in 2006 at the height of the New Atheism movement that he had already spotted signs of a religious renaissance in the early 2000s because young people from the developing world had been rejecting secularism and because Western Europe, home to some of the most secular societies on Earth, had been admitting religious immigrants. Historian of religion Karen Armstrong argued in her 2001 book The Battle for God that there were signs of a revival of conservative Christianity in the United States in the 1970s. (Also see the religious tendencies of Generation Z.) Although the number of atheists, agnostics, and people not affiliated with organized religion continues to grow in Europe and the United States, their percentage of the world population is falling because of their comparatively low fertility rate (1.7). In general, the growth or decline of a given religion is due more to age and fertility rather than conversion. According to the World Religious Database, the proportion of the human population identifying with a religion increased from 81% in 1970 to 85% in 2000 (and is predicted to rise to 87% in 2025). Besides the level of education and income, how religious a woman is determines how many children she will bear in her lifetime. For example, in the cities of the Middle East, women who supported Sharia law had a 50% fertility advantage over those who opposed it the most in the early twenty-first century. In 2018, Muslims had a median age of 23, Hindus 26, Christians 30, Buddhists and the religiously unaffiliated 34, and Jews 36. For comparison, the median age of the global population was 28 in 2018. Overall, Christians have a fertility rate of 2.6, and Muslims 2.9. Islam is the world's fastest growing religion. Meanwhile, the expansion of secularism will slow in Europe as the twenty-first century progresses."]}, {"page": "Wahhabism", "response": ["In 2005, British author and religion academic Karen Armstrong declared that \"Bin Laden was not inspired by Wahhabism but by the writings of the Egyptian ideologue Sayyid Qutb, who was executed by President Nasser in 1966.

But by Muhammad's day, it seems that the Kaaba was venerated as the shrine of Allah, the High God. Allah was never represented by an idol. Once a year, tribes from all around the Arabian peninsula, whether Christian or pagan, would converge on Mecca to perform the Hajj, marking the widespread conviction that Allah was the same deity worshiped by monotheists. Guillaume in his translation of Ibn Ishaq, an early biographer of Muhammad, says the Ka'aba might have been itself addressed using a feminine grammatical form by the Quraysh. Circumambulation was often performed naked by men and almost naked by women, It is disputed whether Allah and Hubal were the same deity or different. Per a hypothesis by Uri Rubin and Christian Robin, Hubal was only venerated by Quraysh and the Kaaba was first dedicated to Allah, a supreme god of individuals belonging to different tribes, while the pantheon of the gods of Quraysh was installed in Kaaba after they conquered Mecca a century before Muhammad's time."]}, {"page": "Simple living", "response": ["Sufism in the Muslim world emerged and grew as a mystical, somewhat hidden tradition in the mainstream Sunni and Shia denominations of Islam, state Eric Hanson and Karen Armstrong, likely in reaction to \"the growing worldliness of Umayyad and Abassid societies\".
