Morrison offered Nico a model for her writings by showing her how he worked on his poems, indicated by her use of internal rhymes. According to Peter Hogan, some of her lyrics \"show a marked debt to Sylvia Plath and to William Blake\" and a search for artistic legitimacy. Other critics have found Nico's lyrics to be intriguing.
