Although women workers were encouraged to engage with official workplace sports teams to improve health and productivity, many played football with each other in their lunch-breaks, forming unsactioned teams such as Bella's Team, the Blyth Spartans, and the Carlisle Munitionettes. Others were invited to join the remaining men's kick-arounds outside working hours. After observing women munitions workers playing football from his office window, Alfred Frankland suggested to worker Grace Sibbert they should establish a team and play for charity. Taking the factory's name and becoming well-known as Dick, Kerr's Ladies F.C., they played a total of 828 games between 1917 and 1965 and raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity in its first few years, a sum equivalent to tens of millions in the 2010s. One of these matches, played at Goodison Park, Liverpool on Boxing Day 1920, attracted a crowd of 53,000, with another 10,000\u201315,000 reportedly turned away because the ground was full. In north east England, the Munitionettes Cup contest in 1917\u201318 was another very popular event, featuring star goal-scorer Bella Raey.
