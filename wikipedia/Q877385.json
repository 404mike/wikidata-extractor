She is best known for her long association with The Guardian, for which she has drawn the series Gemma Bovery (2000) and Tamara Drewe (2005\u201306), both later published as books. Her style gently satirises the English middle classes and in particular those of a literary bent. Both of the published books feature a \"doomed heroine\", much in the style of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century gothic romantic novel, to which they often allude, but with an ironic, modernist slant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 9", "response": ["*  1945   \u2013 Posy Simmonds, English author and illustrator"]}, {"page": "List of cartoonists", "response": ["* Posy Simmonds, The Silent Three of St Botolph's, Gemma Bovery"]}, {"page": "1945", "response": ["* August 9 \u2013 Posy Simmonds, English cartoonist"]}, {"page": "Maureen Lipman", "response": ["After her husband died in May 2004 she completed his autobiography By Jack Rosenthal, and played herself in her daughter's four-part adaptation of the book, Jack Rosenthal's Last Act on BBC Radio Four in July 2006.

Graeme Virtue of the Sunday Herald described its sound as \"quite melancholy\", but praised the song for its catchiness. Tom Ewing from the e-zine Freaky Trigger was mixed on the track. He characterized the song as a \"well-performed, pleasant AOR with a sensible heart, Sheryl Crow drawn by Posy Simmonds\", but founded it uninteresting, calling the instrumentation \"grim\" and the production \"soggy\". Conversely, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun enjoyed the use of guitars in the instrumentation, calling the song a \"great pop tune\". Billboard critic Jon O'Brien ranked \"What Took You So Long?\" third on the magazine's 2018 list of \"The Spice Girls' 20 Best Solo Singles\"; he called it \"one of the simplest\" solo Spice Girls singles and considered the production to be \"tailor-made for drive-time radio\". Lauren Murphy placed it second on Entertainment.ies 2019 list of \"The 10 best Spice Girls solo songs\". She enjoyed the song's melody and Bunton's vocals, describing it as \"a wistful little pop tune\", and she considered the song \"stood the test of time\"."]}, {"page": "List of female comics creators", "response": ["*Posy Simmonds - (Gemma Bovery, Tamara Drewe)"]}, {"page": "Jill Tweedie", "response": ["She is commemorated in a group portrait at the National Portrait Gallery with fellow Guardian Women's Page contributors Mary Stott, Polly Toynbee, Posy Simmonds and Liz Forgan."]}, {"page": "The Cartoon Museum", "response": ["Exhibitions feature catalogues, such as Ronald Searle: Graphic Master, which includes essays on Searle's work.
