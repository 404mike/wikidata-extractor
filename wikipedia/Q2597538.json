Australia also prevented a Japanese government-owned company from taking over an iron mine in Australia, and banned iron ore exports in 1938. However, in July 1939, negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Khatira and the British Ambassador in Tokyo, Robert Craigie, led to an agreement by which Great Britain recognized Japanese conquests in China. At the same time, the US government extended a trade agreement with Japan for six months, then fully restored it. Under the agreement, Japan purchased trucks for the Kwantung Army,US Congress.

The Japanese press claimed that nine had been shot down, but there were no pictures of crashed planes. Embassy staff were \"very happy and proud\" and the British said that they \"drank toasts all day to the American flyers\". Sir Robert Craigie, GCMG, the interned British Ambassador to Japan who was under house arrest in Tokyo at the time, said that Japanese staff had been amused at the embassy's air raid precautions as the idea of an attack on Tokyo was \"laughable\" with the Allies in retreat, but the guards now showed \"considerable excitement and perturbation.\" Several false alarms followed, and in poorer districts people rushed into the streets shouting and gesticulating, losing their normal \"iron control\" over their emotions and showing a \"tendency to panic\".

Ribbentrop, who was determined to succeed at his mission no matter what, began his talks by stating the UK  could either accept the 35:100 ratio as \"fixed and unalterable\" by the weekend, or the German delegation would go home, and the Germans would build their navy up to any size they wished. Simon was visibly angry with Ribbentrop's behaviour: \"It is not usual to make such conditions at the beginning of negotiations\". Simon walked out of the talks. On 5 June 1935, a change of opinion came over the UK's delegation. In a report to the British Cabinet, it was \"definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler's while it is still open.... If we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build to a higher level than 35 per cent.... Having regard to past history and to Germany's known capacity to become a serious naval rival of this country, we may have cause to regret it if we fail to take this chance...\". Also, on 5 June, during talks between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Foreign Office's naval expert and chief of the Foreign Office's American Department, and Ribbentrop's deputy, Admiral Karlgeorg Schuster, the Germans conceded that the 35:100 ratio would be expressed in ship tonnage, the Germans building their tonnage up to whatever the UK's tonnage was in various warship categories. On the afternoon of that same day, the British Cabinet voted to accept the 35:100 ratio, and Ribbentrop was informed of the Cabinet's acceptance in the evening."]}, {"page": "Robert Craigie, Lord Glendoick", "response": ["Robert Craigie, Lord Glendoick (1685\u20131760)http://www.scottish-places.info/parishes/parhistory581.html was a Scottish politician and judge.

The British Foreign Office was strongly pro-Chinese and, as Rothwell noted, Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador in Tokyo was \"slapped down when in late 1938 he advocated what, in effect, would have been a Far Eastern equivalent of Munich\".Rothwell, Victor The Origins of the Second World War, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001, p. 142 The pro-Chinese sympathies of the Foreign Office were reflected in the greater respect given to the Sinophile ambassador to China, Archibald Clark Kerr, despite the straitlaced Japanophile Craigie being a far more traditional British diplomat than the flamboyant, hard-drinking and very active bisexual Clark Kerr.Rothwell, Victor, The Origins of the Second World War, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001, p. 142 Britain could not risk a war with Japan, which would divert British military force to the Far East and thus encourage Germany and Italy to engage in aggressive actions. At the same time, the British government would not accept a Japanese conquest of China and so financially supported China.Rothwell, Victor, The Origins of the Second World War, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001, pp  142-143 In late 1937, Chiang Kai-shek lost Shanghai]], the business capital of China from which came 85% of Chinese tax revenues, to the Japanese.Rothwell, Victor The Origins of the Second World War, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001, pp  140. After the fall of Shanghai, Chiang was hard-pressed to find the money needed to continue the war with Japan. The Chamberlain government had its version of the domino theory in which if Japan conquered China, Japan would certainly extend its ambitions to Britain's Asian colonies and to the dominions of Australia and New Zealand. Chamberlain and the rest of his cabinet would never accept a Japanese conquest of Australia, New Zealand, India and the rest of the British colonies in the Far East, and they were resolved to fight to uphold Britain's position in the Asia-Pacific region, if necessary, and the Japanese made unacceptable demands. When Japan confiscated British-owned railways in China or seized British-owned ships in Chinese waters without compensation, the British government presented only notes of protest, as war with Japan was regarded only as a worst-case scenario.Rothwell, Victor, The Origins of the Second World War, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001, p. 143 Meanwhile, money was still committed to the Singapore naval base and to fortifying Hong Kong to deter Japan from further aggression. The Chamberlain government would have liked to have enlisted the United States to present an Anglo-American front to stop the Japanese war against China, but the unwillingness of the Roosevelt administration to take such a step precluded a more active British policy in the Far East.Rothwell, Victor, The Origins of the Second World War, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001, pp. 143-144", "A major crisis that preoccupied Chamberlain in the summer of 1939 was the Tientsin Incident. The British refusal to hand over to the Japanese four Chinese nationalists accused of murdering a Japanese collaborator caused the British concession in Tianjin, China, to be blockaded by the Imperial Japanese Army on 14 June 1939.Watt, D.C. How War Came, New York: Pantheon, 1939, p. 354 In particular, reports in the British press of the maltreatment by the Japanese of British subjects wishing to leave or to enter the concession, especially the public stripsearching of British women at bayonet-point by Japanese soldiers, enraged British public opinion and led to much pressure on the government to take action against Japan.Watt, D.C. How War Came, New York: Pantheon, 1939 pages 354\u2013355 Chamberlain considered the crisis to be so important that he ordered the Royal Navy to give greater attention to a possible war with Japan than to a war with Germany.Watt, D.C. How War Came, New York: Pantheon, 1939 page 356 On 26 June 1939, the Royal Navy reported that the only way of ending the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to the Far East and that the current crisis in Europe of Germany threatening Poland made that militarily inadvisable. In addition, Chamberlain faced strong pressure from the French not to weaken British naval strength in the Mediterranean because of the danger that Mussolini might honour the Pact of Steel if war broke out in Europe. After an unsuccessful effort to obtain a promise of American support (the United States informed Britain that it would not risk a war with Japan purely for British interests), Chamberlain ordered Sir Robert Craigie, the British ambassador, to find any way of ending the crisis without too much loss of British prestige.Watt, D.C.
