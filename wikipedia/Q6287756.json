This initially included William James M\u00fcller, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham, John Skinner Prout and Robert Tucker, according to Tucker's own account. The meetings later grew to include more artists, although relatively few surviving drawings have been identified, compared to the meetings of the 1820s, and by the 1830s the works of the Bristol School were less original. Other participants in the meetings probably included Samuel Jackson, Stephen C. Jones, James Baker Pyne, Henry Brittan Willis, W. Williams, Joseph Walter, George Arthur Fripp, Edmund Gustavus M\u00fcller, and William Evans. These sketching meetings may have lasted into the 1840s."]}, {"page": "Joe Walter", "response": ["* Joseph Walter (1783\u20131856), British marine artist"]}, {"page": "Walter, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Walter"]}]}}
