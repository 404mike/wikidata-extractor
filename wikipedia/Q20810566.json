Burke was born in Ireland, around 1843, where he was a tradesman. He applied for a job in the British Army as an official photographer but travelled to Afghanistan at his own expense using heavy cameras that would have needed transporting on pack animals through mountainous regions. He was the first significant photographer of Afghanistan. Burke died in 1900.\nBurke's photographs have been grouped in albums with those of Benjamin Simpson and other photographers, so definitive attribution is not possible for some of his works.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Burke", "response": ["John Burke may refer to:", "*John Burke, 9th Earl of Clanricarde (1642\u20131722), Irish peer", "*Sir John Burke, 2nd Baronet (1782\u20131847), Irish soldier and MP for Galway County", "*John Burke (politician) (1859\u20131937), 10th Governor of North Dakota and Treasurer of the United States", "**John Burke (Fairbanks), a 1963 bronze sculpture", "*John Burke (mayor) (born 1946), mayor of Porirua City New Zealand, 1983\u20131998", "*John Burke (spy) (1830\u20131871), Confederate spy in the American Civil War", "*John Burke (colonel) (1838\u20131914), officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War", "*John Burke (composer) (1951\u20132020), Canadian composer", "*John Burke (American pianist) (born 1988), American composer & pianist", "*John Burke (1900s pitcher) (1877\u20131950), U.S. baseball player for the New York Giants", "*John Burke (1990s pitcher) (born 1970), U.S. baseball player for the Colorado Rockies and the University of Florida", "*John Burke (American football) (born 1971), played for the New England Patriots, New York Jets and San Diego Chargers", "*John Burke (footballer, fl. 1927\u201335), Irish footballer from Tipperary", "*John Burke (footballer, born 1956), Irish footballer from Dublin", "*John Burke (footballer, born 1962), Scottish footballer for Exeter City and Chester City", "*John Burke (rugby league, born 1948) (1948\u20132013), rugby league footballer of the 1970s for Leeds, Keighley", "*John Burke (rugby league, born 1957), rugby league footballer of the 1970s for Wigan, and Workington Town", "*Jack Burke Sr. (John Burke, 1888\u20131943), American golfer", "*Jack Burke Jr. (John Burke, born 1923), American golfer", "*John Burke (genealogist) (1786\u20131848), Irish genealogist, founder of Burke's Peerage", "*Arizona John Burke (1842\u20131917), American publicist, press agent and author", "*John Burke (author) (1922\u20132011), English writer of novels and short stories", "*John Burke (artist) (1946\u20132006), Irish artist ", "*John Burke (photographer), 19th century British photographer", "*John Burke, president of Trek Bicycle Corporation", "*SS John Burke, an American Liberty Ship destroyed in a kamikaze attack"]}, {"page": "Samuel Bourne", "response": ["* John Burke (photographer)"]}, {"page": "War photography", "response": ["The Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878\u20131880 was photographed by John Burke who traveled with the British forces.
