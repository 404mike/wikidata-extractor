The train, consisting of the Royal Saloon, two first class carriages and a brake van made the journey from Bricklayers Arms to Tunbridge Wells in 75 minutes. It was driven by James Cudworth, the Locomotive Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 70 minutes. The Royal Train visited the line again on 18December 1849 conveying Queen Victoria and Princess Alice from Windsor, Berkshire to Tunbridge Wells on a visit to Princess Louise. The journey via Waterloo took 100 minutes. The train was driven by William Jacomb, Resident Engineer of the LSWR, and Edgar Verringer, Superintendent of the LSWR.

They were followed by Matthew Kirtley on the Midland Railway (26 locomotive built 1869-70) and Patrick Stirling on the Great Northern Railway (48 locomotive built 1873-81).Baxter (1977). The more common side-tank version was introduced on the Great Eastern Railway by Samuel Waite Johnson in 1872, and was soon afterwards adopted by most mainline railways in the UK, and became the standard configuration for a passenger tank locomotive until about 1900. Examples have included the LSWR O2 Class, Midland Railway 2228 Class, the LSWR M7 Class and the Caledonian Railway 439 Class. The last British design of 0-4-4T were the LMS Stanier 0-4-4T of 1932 which were based on the Midland Railway 2228 Class.  Preserved 0-4-4T locomotives in the UK are SECR H class No. 263 on the Bluebell Railway, LSWR O2 class No.W24 'Calbourne' on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, LSWR M7 Nos. 245 in the National Railway Museum and 53 (as BR 30053) on the Swanage Railway, Metropolitan Railway E Class No.1 at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, CR No.419 by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society and the Duke of Sutherland's 'Dunrobin' which was brought back from Canada by Beamish Museum.
