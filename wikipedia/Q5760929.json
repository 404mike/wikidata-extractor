Its history after Aytoun's death is uncertain and obscure. However, it was discovered by Mr Hilary Corke in an Edinburgh bookshop-depository in 1955.

The Forbes books had been deposited before 1939 and had not been disturbed between that time and 1955. This MS contained only the texts, and having noted that Amelia Harris refers to the writing down of the airs, an extremely thorough search was made for the airs manuscript in the depository, but it was not found and remains lost.", "This manuscript is also bound, probably under Aytoun's instruction. It has a maroon cover, with the wording \"M.S. OLD SCOTTISH BALLADS\" on its spine, marbled endpapers and Hilary Corke's bookplate inside the front cover. Hilary Corke, a lecturer in Mediaeval English Literature at the University of Edinburgh, realised the value of his find, and wrote to Harvard University for information about the Harris MS listed by Child as being in Harvard College Library - a correspondence passed on to the curator of the Houghton Library. The important discovery of the \"lost\" manuscript was first made in print in 1977 by Dr Emily Lyle of The School of Scottish Studies, University of Edinburgh, although she had been in touch with Hilary Corke for a couple of years prior to that.The Song Repertoire of Amelia and Jane Harris, Scottish Text Society, pp. xxx-xxxi"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2001", "response": ["*Hilary Corke, 80, British writer, composer and mineralogist."]}, {"page": "1921 in British music", "response": ["*12 July \u2013 Hilary Corke, writer and composer (died 2001)"]}]}}
