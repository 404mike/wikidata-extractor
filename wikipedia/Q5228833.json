Following the operation, he was unable to regain his place in the Bath City side and instead joined Conference South leaders Newport County in February 2010 in a loan exchange deal with Dave Gilroy. He made his debut for the club on 20 February as a substitute in place of Craig Reid during a 4\u20130 win over Hampton & Richmond Borough. He made a total of six appearances during his loan spell, scoring his only goal during a 5\u20131 win over Basingstoke Town, before returning to Bath in March 2010. At the end of the season, with Bath winning promotion to the Conference Premier, Douglas was released, and in August 2010, following a successful pre-season spell, he signed for Dorchester Town. He was released by The Magpies in October 2010. He joined Poole Town on 4 November 2010."]}, {"page": "David Gilroy", "response": ["#redirect Dave Gilroy"]}]}}
