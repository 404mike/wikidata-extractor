He ran a family grocery business \"Austin Hodgkinson\", having as a result little time to spare for the sport. He made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1935 season against the touring South Africans in May. In the match, he made 44 runs including nine fours which came mainly from drives and this was the side's top score in the match and his own career best score. He made two more first-team appearances for the Derbyshire team in 1935 and one in the 1937 season. Otherwise, he played mainly in second team games in the pre-war period.\nIn World War II Hodgkinson was wounded badly in the head and taken prisoner in 1940. After the war he was captain for the 1946 season at a time when Derbyshire had difficulty finding anyone to commit to the task. He played regularly in the season and Derbyshire ended the season fifteenth in the table. Hodgkinson ended his career with Derbyshire in 1946 but played one game for North Wales in 1947.\nHodgkinson was a right-handed batsman and played 32 innings in 19 first-class matches with an average of 14.75 and a top score of 44. He was considered to be \"never anything more than a good club cricketer\".Hodgkinson died at The Pastures, Mickleover, Derbyshire, at the age of 73.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Skinner (cricketer)", "response": ["Skinner was appointed as county captain for the 1949 season in accordance with the tradition of amateur captaincy. Skinner himself was a modest performer, though in this he was no different from the other amateurs \u2013 Gilbert Hodgkinson and Edward Gothard \u2013 who had captained an otherwise entirely professional side since the Second World War. The move was not successful, and Derbyshire, missing the all-round skills of George Pope, fell to 15th place in the County Championship.Wisden 1999, p. 1490. Towards the end of the season other amateurs appeared after fulfilling their schoolmastering commitments, and Skinner did not play in the last few matches of the season and never played first-class cricket again. Skinner was a right-handed batsman in the lower-middle-order and played 36 innings in 23 first-class matches with an average of 13.57 and a top score of 63. He was a right-arm off-break bowler who bowled occasionally taking 2 first-class wickets at an average of 91.David Skinner at Cricket Archive"]}, {"page": "List of Old Derbeians", "response": ["*Gilbert Hodgkinson (1913\u20131987), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Hodgkinson", "response": ["*Gilbert Hodgkinson, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["| 1946|| 27|| 5|| 13 || 9|| 15 ||Gilbert Hodgkinson || Denis Smith || Cliff Gladwin ||Denis Smith"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1946", "response": ["On the resumption of county cricket after the second world war in 1946 the main problem affecting Derbyshire was that of finding a regular captain.
