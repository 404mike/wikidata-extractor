He attended Cheltenham College and first played for Clifton in the 1961\u201362 season after leaving Cheltenham, but only played a few games for the club before joining Harlequins, where he spent the remainder of his rugby career in England.Lloyd played against the 1967 New Zealand touring team for the Midlands, London & Home Counties at Leicester on 28 October 1967, scoring a try.  A week later on 4 November 1967 Lloyd was selected to play for England, making his international debut against New Zealand at Twickenham and scoring two tries as England lost 16\u201323. He was also invited to play for the Barbarians against New Zealand later that month, scoring a further try, as well as appearing for the Barbarians in the 1967 match against Leicester. Lloyd played in all four England matches of the 1968 Five Nations, which brought his total of England appearances to five. He appeared in the England trial matches in 1969 and toured the Far East with England in 1971 captaining the England team in a non cap match against Japan in the absence of the tour captain Budge Rogers through injury but won no further full caps after 1968. He was selected for the 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa but declined the invitation due to engineering exam commitments.Lloyd was Harlequins' captain in the 1970\u201371 and 1971\u201372 seasons and also represented the Surrey county team, playing in their county championship finals in 1967, when they shared the title with Durham and in 1971, when they beat Gloucestershire 14 \u2013 3 at Kingsholm.  His total of 46 appearances for Surrey has been exceeded only by Bob Hiller.\nIn August 1973 Lloyd emigrated to Hong Kong where he played rugby for the Hong Kong Football Club and captained Hong Kong against Wales in 1975 and the Hong Kong Sevens team in the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens in 1976 during which they won the Plate competition.  Lloyd worked for the Hong Kong Government for 30 years until his retirement in 2003.  He has since worked with a Hong Kong civil engineering contractor as its Business Development Director and as a Project Manager for a civil engineering consultant until his third retirement at the end of 2015.  \nLloyd was inducted into the Harlequins F. C. Hall of Fame in December 2012.\nBob Lloyd was a civil engineer who studied at the Hatfield Polytechnic and is a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a Member of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Lloyd", "response": ["* Bob Lloyd (cricketer) (born 1947), Australian cricketer", "* Bob Lloyd (rugby union) (born 1943), English rugby union footballer who played in the 1960s and 1970s", "* Bob Lloyd (born 1946), American professional basketball player"]}, {"page": "1968 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["Bob Lloyd (Harlequins and England) was selected in the original touring team but had to withdraw because of exam commitments and was replaced by Jarrett."]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|961||Bob Lloyd||centre ||1967-11-04||v New Zealand at Twickenham"]}, {"page": "Surrey Rugby Football Union", "response": ["*Bob Lloyd (Harlequins) \u2013 46"]}, {"page": "List of rugby union players who have represented more than one nation", "response": ["| Bob Lloyd"]}, {"page": "1967 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, France and Canada", "response": ["England: 15.
