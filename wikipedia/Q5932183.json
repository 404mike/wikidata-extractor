His most significant contributions to music criticism were as a commentator on that portion of twentieth-century music which retained an allegiance to tonality; thus Nielsen, Shostakovich and Sibelius featured largely in his output. He was especially associated with British tonal composers such as Edmund Rubbra and Robert Simpson. He died in Malvern, aged 54.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ralph Vaughan Williams", "response": ["Ravel took few pupils, and was known as a demanding taskmaster for those he agreed to teach.Nichols, p. 67 Vaughan Williams spent three months in Paris in the winter of 1907\u20131908, working with him four or five times each week.Vaughan Williams (1964), p. 80 There is little documentation of Vaughan Williams's time with Ravel; the musicologist Byron Adams advises caution in relying on Vaughan Williams's recollections in the Musical Autobiography written forty-three years after the event.Adams (2013), pp. 40\u201341 The degree to which the French composer influenced the Englishman's style is debated.Cobbe, p. 11 Ravel declared Vaughan Williams to be \"my only pupil who does not write my music\";Adams (2013), p. 40 nevertheless, commentators including Kennedy, Adams, Hugh Ottaway and Alain Frogley find Vaughan Williams's instrumental textures lighter and sharper in the music written after his return from Paris, such as the String Quartet in G minor, On Wenlock Edge, the Overture to The Wasps and A Sea Symphony.Kennedy (1980), p. 114; and Adams (2013) pp. 41 and 44\u201346 Vaughan Williams himself said that Ravel had helped him escape from \"the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner\".Nichols, p. 68"]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 11 (Shostakovich)", "response": ["The Eleventh is sometimes dubbed \"a film score without the film\". An additional thread is provided by the nine revolutionary songs that appear during the work. Some of these songs date back to the 19th century, others to the year 1905. Shostakovich integrates them into the textures of his symphony. This use of folk and revolutionary songs was a departure from his usual style. They were also songs the composer knew well. His family knew and sang them regularly while he was growing up.Volkov, 37\u201338. In his study of Shostakovich's symphonies, Hugh Ottaway praised the Eleventh as one of the great achievements in program music."]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 15 (Shostakovich)", "response": ["Its use of an extended percussion section aside, the symphony is scored for forces smaller than those employed for his First. The first movement begins with two chimes on the glockenspiel, followed by a five-note motif on solo flute, accompanied by pizzicato strings. This leads into a galloping motif for trumpet constructed out of all twelve notes of the Western chromatic scale. Hugh Ottaway observed that Shostakovich's use of such motifs in this symphony create an \"enlarged tonal field in which 'chromatic' and 'diatonic' cease to be meaningful distinctions.\" Recurring throughout the movement are quotations from Gioacchino Rossini's overture to his opera William Tell. A brass chorale opens the second movement, which gives way to a cello solo. These themes alternate with a dotted funereal motif introduced by a pair of solo flutes, then taken up by a solo trombone, which builds up to a fortississimo climax. A muted string restatement of the opening chorale fades away on a timpani roll, after which bassoons announce the start of the scherzando third movement. The finale contains several quotations, starting with the \"fate motif\" from Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, then the opening motif from his Tristan und Isolde, before segueing into a reminiscence of Mikhail Glinka's \"Do Not Tempt Me Needlessly.\" A passacaglia theme which has drawn commentary for its resemblance to the march from Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony builds to another powerful climax. The symphony ends with the celesta restating the symphony's opening motif, followed by an open A-major chord sustained over a percussion part that recalls the scherzo of his Fourth Symphony, which is finally resolved by a three-octave C-sharp."]}, {"page": "A Sea Symphony", "response": ["The impact of A Sea Symphony manifests itself not only in the life of the composer (his first symphony and first work of such an immense scale), but also in the newfound support and appreciation of the English symphony and 20th century English music in general.
