George Heneage Lawrence Dundas CB (8 September 1778 \u2013 7 October 1834) was a senior officer in the Royal Navy. As a junior officer he came to prominence due to his brave conduct during a fire on the first-rate HMS Queen Charlotte. As a result of this he was appointed to the command of the sixth-rate HMS Calpe in which he took part in the Battle of Algeciras Bay in July 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. After serving for four years as Whig Member of Parliament for Richmond, he was given command of the fifth-rate HMS Euryalus and took part in the unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign in July 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars. He transferred to the third-rate HMS Edinburgh and landed troops at Viareggio in Italy in November 1812 later in that War. He went on to be Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland and became First Naval Lord in the First Melbourne ministry in August 1834 but died in office just two months later in October 1834.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Second Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff", "response": ["* Rear Admiral George Dundas, 1830\u20131834"]}, {"page": "Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| George Dundas", "| George Dundas"]}, {"page": "Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|George Dundas||Whig", "|George Dundas||Whig"]}]}}
