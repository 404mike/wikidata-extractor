Natalie has performed at numerous gigs within the UK, mainly within the gay scene.\nNatalie's first single was in 1996 and was a cover of Celine Dion's 'It's All Coming Back to Me Now'. It has been repeatedly rumoured (but unconfirmed) that the vocalist on this first single was a different person from the later tracks. It is also believed that the vocalist also provided vocals for other projects on the label including Abbacadabra, Tasmin, Rochelle and Belle Lawrence.\nIn 1998 Browne caused confusion in America when the single for her version of the song \"Torn\" (originally by the U.S. band Ednaswap) was released.  Many copies were sold because people thought the single was the then-popular cover version by Natalie Imbruglia. Imbruglia's version was not released as a physical single in the U.S.\nNatalie's single 'From Here to Eternity' was written and produced by Mike Stock and Matt Aitken of the hugely successful Stock, Aitken and Waterman production team.\nNatalie Browne tracks were included on the soundtrack for Russell T Davies Channel 4 series, Queer As Folk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Natalie Brown", "response": ["* Natalie Browne, England-based vocalist project name owned by Almighty Records"]}, {"page": "Almighty Records", "response": ["Almighty feature various artist names, which are in fact projects rather than actual singers or groups, with many different vocalists and session singers behind artists' names,Natalie Browne \u2013 Wikipedia page of the Almighty Records artist project many of them already famous as recording artists and even hit songwriters.
