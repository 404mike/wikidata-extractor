Billy Moore scored a hat-trick, with the other goals coming from Dick Richards, Jimmy Ruffell and Jack Tresadern.", "The match, that became known as the White Horse Final, kicked off 45 minutes late with thousands of fans standing on the touchlines. West Ham were 1-0 down within six minutes. Jack Tresadern entered the crowd to retrieve the ball and before he could return to the pitch Bolton had profited from the numerical advantage and taken the lead, with a header from David Jack. After a half-time break which had seen the players remain on the pitch, West Ham's only chance of the game came as Dick Richards swung a chest-high cross from the right wing for Vic Watson who had his shot saved and held by Bolton goalkeeper Dick Pym. Soon after, Bolton secured their victory with a goal from John Smith. There were so many bodies pressing up behind the goal that the ball instantly rebounded out and many had mistakenly thought that the ball had just hit a post.

West Ham's game plan initially centred on the two fast-moving outside-forwards Dick Richards and Jimmy Ruffell, but Bolton set out from the start to keep the two players contained, rushing at them whenever they got the ball.  After just two minutes West Ham half-back Jack Tresadern became entangled in the crowd after taking a throw-in and was unable to return to the pitch immediately.  This gave Bolton's David Jack the opportunity to shoot for goal.  His shot beat West Ham goalkeeper Ted Hufton to give Bolton the lead, and hit a spectator who was standing pressed against the goal net, knocking him unconscious. Three minutes later Vic Watson received the ball a few yards in front of the Bolton goal but his shot flew over the crossbar. Eleven minutes into the game the crowd surged forward once again and a large number of fans encroached onto the pitch, leading to the suspension of play while the mounted police again cleared the playing area. A number of fans required first aid from members of the British Red Cross while the players looked on and awaited the resumption of play. Policemen patrolled the perimeter of the pitch to keep it clear for the linesmen, after play was resumed.", "Soon after play restarted, West Ham's Dick Richards eluded two Bolton defenders and shot for goal. Bolton goalkeeper Dick Pym fumbled the ball but managed to kick it clear before it crossed the goal-line. Bolton continued to dominate the match, and were only prevented from scoring again by a strong performance from West Ham full-back Billy Henderson. When West Ham attacked, however, Bolton were able to quickly switch to a strongly defensive formation, as players changed positions to form a line of five half-backs. This stifled West Ham's attacking style of play and ensured that the Bolton goal was not seriously threatened, and the score remained 1\u20130 to Bolton until half-time.  Due to the crowds that surrounded the pitch, the players were unable to reach the dressing-rooms and instead remained on the pitch for five minutes before starting the second half.", "|FW || || Dick Richards"]}, {"page": "History of the Wales national football team (1876\u20131976)", "response": ["Wales' first fixtures at the end of the war were two friendly matches against England, organised to raise funds for the FAW. The matches were not considered full internationals, being titled victory matches instead. Wales won the first meeting, led by the 40-year-old Meredith, but were defeated in the return match a fortnight later. The British Home Championship returned for the 1919\u201320 season with Wales' first official post-war match ending in a 2\u20132 draw with pre-war champions Ireland in Belfast. A draw against Scotland was followed by a 2\u20131 victory over England, the first time Wales had defeated their neighbours in a competitive fixture since 1882. Goals from Stan Davies and Dick Richards secured victory for Wales, who had been reduced to ten men in the second half when Harry Millership went off injured, but the performance of the now 45-year-old Meredith drew headlines. Winning his final cap, 25 years after his debut, Meredith wept openly at the end of the match. He ended his international career as both Wales' most-capped player and record goalscorer having scored 11 times in 48 appearances. To secure the championship, the team still needed England to defeat Scotland. The Scots led 4\u20132 at half-time, but lost the match 5\u20134, handing the title to Wales."]}]}}
