The following season, Ben Davies remained first choice at the start of the campaign before Farquharson featured in five consecutive matches between October and November 1922. The pair continued to compete throughout the season with Farquharson featuring in 21 league matches (one more than Davies) and playing in the club's 3\u20132 victory over Aberdare Athletic in the 1923 Welsh Cup final.

Hardy featured in the club's first match in the new league against his former side Stockport. In his tenth year since joining Cardiff, Hardy was awarded a benefit match for a league fixture on 21 April 1921 against Rotherham County, sharing the proceeds of the match with goalkeeper Herbert Kneeshaw.

In his second year, he began to improve the club's fortunes as they were promoted into the First Division of the Southern Football League. Stewart made several signings before the start of the campaign, reshaping the club's defence with the signings of goalkeeper Herbert Kneeshaw and defenders Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey. Stewart led the side to the Second Division title, having lost only one of their 24 games with his newly formed defence proving instrumental to their success, conceding only 15 goals during the campaign.

Cardiff faced Bristol City again in their next fixture with goalkeeper Herbert Kneeshaw missing his first match of the season after suffering a cheek injury; his replacement, Ben Davies, went on to feature in all of the club's remaining fixtures.
