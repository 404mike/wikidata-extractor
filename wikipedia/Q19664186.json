A month later, Cooke scored his first and only goal for Staines in their 2\u20131 victory over Weston-super-Mare. On 10 August 2015, Cooke joined recently relegated National League side Cheltenham Town on a one-month loan. Throughout Cooke's loan spell at the club, he failed to register a single start, making six substitute appearances before returning to Swindon at the end of the month. Following a frustrating loan spell at Cheltenham, Cooke joined National League North side Gloucester City on a one-month loan deal in October 2015. On 3 October 2015, Cooke made his Gloucester City debut in their 1\u20130 home defeat against Harrogate Town, featuring for 72 minutes before being replaced by Joe Parker. A few weeks later, Cooke scored his first league goal for the club in their 1\u20130 victory over Corby Town, netting the winner in the 66th minute."]}]}}
