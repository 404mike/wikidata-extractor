After a dismal first half display where the Pars went up by 2 and were unlucky to not score more, Dundee came out with a draw after Danny Johnson netted two penalties and the side improved in the second half to leave with a point. Dundee followed up with a more impressive showing at Dens, defeating Ayr United 1\u20130 via an Andrew Nelson header. In their League Cup second round match, Dundee would provide tough opposition to Premiership side Aberdeen and would lead for the majority for the game, before the Dons netted a late equaliser and then a winner in extra time. Upon returning to league action, Dundee would play out a 0\u20130 draw at home against Inverness, before taking on rivals Dundee United in the first Dundee derby in 2 years, and the first league derby since the Dees relegated their rivals from the Premiership three years prior. In front of over 14,000 fans at Tannadice, a bizarre and controversial game swung the way of the Terrors, who ran out 6\u20132 winners in what was a rough night for the Dark Blues."]}]}}
