These were highly popular. By the late 19th century Jessica's First Prayer had sold a million and a half copies \u2013 ten times more than Alice in Wonderland. She concocted \"Hesba Stretton\" from the initials of herself and four surviving siblings, along with the name of a Shropshire village she visited, All Stretton, where her sister Anne owned a house, Caradoc Lodge.", "link_mentions": {}}}
