William Wymark Jacobs (1863\u20131943) lived at The Outlook, Upper Park Road before moving to Feltham House, Goldings Road. Best known as the author of the short story The Monkey's Paw. Jacobs also wrote numerous sardonic short stories based in 'Claybury', a thinly veiled fictionalisation of Loughton. Rudyard Kipling (1865\u20131936) stayed as a child at Goldings Hill Farm.

"]}, {"page": "Mary Martha Sherwood", "response": ["Sherwood's earliest works are the sentimental novels Traditions (1795) and Margarita (1795). Both are more worldly than her later works, but neither received much recognition. By contrast, The History of Susan Gray, written for the girls of her Sunday school class in Bridgnorth, made Sherwood a famous author. Like Hannah More's tracts, it is designed to teach middle-class morality to the poor. This novel \u2014 which Patricia Demers, a children's literature scholar, describes as a \"purified Pamela\" \u2014 tells the story of Susan, an orphaned servant girl who \"resists the advances of a philandering soldier; though trembling with emotion at the man's declaration of love and promise of marriage.\"Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton\", p. 143. The reader is regularly reminded of the \"wages of sin\" since Susan's story is told from her deathbed. A separate narrator, seemingly Sherwood, often interrupts the tale to warn readers against particular actions, such as becoming a \"bad woman.\"Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton\", 143. Despite a didactic tone that is often distasteful to modern readers, Susan Gray was so popular on its appearance that it was pirated by several publishers. In 1816, Sherwood published a revised and \"improved\" version, which Sarah Trimmer reviewed positively in The Guardian of Education. Sherwood wrote a companion story, The History of Lucy Clare, which was published in 1810.Dawson, p. 272.", "The strongest themes in Sherwood's early evangelical writings are the need to recognize one's innate \"depravity\" and the need to prepare for eternity.Cutt, pp. 38\u201339; Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton, p. 133. For Sherwood, the main lessons emphasize \"faith, resignation, and implicit obedience to the will of God.\"Cutt, pp. 38\u201339. In her adaptation of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678), The Infant's Progress (1821), she represents original sin as a child named \"In-bred Sin\" who tempts the young pilgrims on their way to the Celestial City (Heaven). It is these battles with In-bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text. The allegory is complex and, as Demers admits, \"tedious\" for even the \"willing reader\".Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton\", p. 137. So \"some young readers may have found [In-bred Sin's] activities more interesting than the spiritual struggles of the little heroes, reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation.\"Dawson, p. 274. Such religious allegory, though not always so overt, continued to be a favourite literary device of Sherwood's.", "As Cutt argues, \"the great overriding metaphor of all [Sherwood's] work is the representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden).... No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed in the sight of God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God.\"Cutt, p. 41. See also Vallone, p. 85, and Harper, p. 4. Demers has referred to this \"consciously double vision\" as the quintessentially Romantic element of Sherwood's writing.Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton,\" p. 131. Nowhere is this more evident than in Sherwood's The History of the Fairchild Family, the first part of which appeared in 1818.", "Sherwood's vigorous anti-Catholicism appears most obviously in her works from the 1820s and 1830s. During the 1820s in Britain, Catholics were agitating for greater civil rights and it was at this time that Sherwood wrote her most sustained attacks against them. When the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was passed, Sherwood and many like her were frightened of the influence Catholics might gain in the government. So she wrote Victoria (1833), The Nun (1833)Maureen Moran, Catholic Sensationalism and Victorian Literature (2007), p. 77. and The Monk of Cimies (1834) to illustrate some of the supposed dangers of Catholicism. The Monk narrates, in the first person, Edmund Etherington's decision to renounce the Church of England and join the Catholic church. While a monk, he ridicules his fellow brothers, plans a murder and debauches a young woman.Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton, p. 145. Some evangelicals disagreed with her views on Catholic Emancipation and were uncomfortable with these books; one evangelical reviewer called The Monk of Cimies \"unfair and unconvincing\".Quoted in Dawson, p. 278", "Colonial themes were a thread in Sherwood's texts; The History of Henry Milner (1822\u201337), its sequel John Marten (1844), and The Indian Orphans (1839) all evince Sherwood's interest in these topics. Her writings on India reveal her sense of superiority over the inhabitants of India; the subcontinent therefore appears in her works as a morally corrupt land in need of reformation.Cutt, p. 20; Dawson, p. 273; Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton,\" p. 134. She wrote The History of George Desmond (1821) to warn young men of the dangers of emigrating to India. Sherwood's books shaped the minds of several generations of young Britons. According to Cutt, Sherwood's depictions of India were among the few available to young British readers; such children \"acquired a strong conviction of the rightness of missions, which, while it inculcated sincere concern for, and a genuine kindness towards an alien people for whom Britain was responsible, quite destroyed any latent respect for Indian tradition.\"Cutt, p. 21. Cutt attributes the growing paternalism of 19th-century British policies on India in part to the widespread popularity of Sherwood's books.", "*Demers, Patricia. \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton: The Letter and Spirit of Evangelical Writing for Children\", Romanticism and Children's Literature in Nineteenth-century England, ed.
