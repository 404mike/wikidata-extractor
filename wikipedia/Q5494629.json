He went on to sign as a professional in March 1931. By the end of the 1931\u201332 season he had displaced Fred Biddlestone as first choice 'keeper and missed only one league game over the next three seasons, helping Villa to claim the runners-up position in the Football League in the 1932\u201333 season and reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1933\u201334."]}, {"page": "Roy John (footballer)", "response": ["He then joined Walsall, where he played for the reserve side as a half-back. Following the departure of Fred Biddlestone to Aston Villa in January 1930 and an injury to the reserve goalkeeper, manager Sid Scholey asked John to try out for the custodian's shirt. John did so well in a practice match that he was quickly promoted to first-team goalkeeper. Within months he made his international debut, when he played for Wales against Ireland on 22 April 1931. His debut match ended in a 3\u20132 victory to the Welsh. One writer of the time described him as \"dashing and daring \u2013 a gay cavalier who laughs fortune in the face\"."]}]}}
