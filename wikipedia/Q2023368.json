Collins' start to his reign as Bohs' manager was relatively impressive, and new signings such as Kevin Hunt eventually dragged the side out of relegation trouble and to safety. However, a poor run of results at the end of the season saw the Gypsies, which has never been outside of the top tier of Irish football, plummet back into relegation trouble, and were forced to take part in a play-off with Cobh Ramblers. Bohemians won the play-off convincingly, 7\u20130 on aggregate. He remained as manager during the close-season, though he was under pressure from both the supporters and the committee at Bohemians.", "In the league that season Bohs were showing good form, though with Glen Crowe emerging as a phenomenal goal-scorer and Kevin Hunt marshalling the midfield. Once out of Europe, results began to dip, and Collins found himself under pressure. Shelbourne were clear leaders at the top, and a huge investment in the Bohemians playing side looked set to fail to reap just rewards. In January 2001, Collins was under huge pressure as Bohemians travelled to Santry to take on fierce rivals Shamrock Rovers. At half time, Bohemians were trailing the game by 3 goals, as Rovers scored 4 to Bohs 1. It looked certain that a new manager would be appointed following the game. However, in one of the most remarkable come-backs in Irish football, Bohemians put 5 past a shell-shocked Rovers side in the second half and won 6\u20134. That result, coupled with a break for several weeks due to the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK and Ireland, gave Bohemians the momentum to mount a late challenge for the league."]}, {"page": "Stephen Caffrey", "response": ["Caffrey formed a solid partnership with Kevin Hunt in the centre of Bohs' midfield and played a huge part in Bohemians League and Cup double in 2001.
