Blackwood produced a duet version of the album's lead single \"Call Me\", recorded with English vocalist Jack Savoretti, included on streaming editions of the album post-release. Throughout the album's creative process, May received guidance from Irish musician Bono, of rock group U2. The album followed May's divorce from guitarist Darrel Higham, influencing many lyrical themes on the album. Life Love Flesh Blood features soft rock and acoustic styles, differing significantly from the rockabilly genre of previous albums.", "To critical acclaim, May released her previous album, Tribal, on 25 April 2014.

Following their divorce, Higham also quit May's band. The break-up influenced many of the themes on the album, but also gave May the courage to depart from her previous rockabilly genre. In a July 2015 interview with the Irish Independent, May confirmed that she had started working on the album, and that the release was slated for early 2016. After being postponed, the album was finally announced in November 2016, scheduled to be released on 31 March 2017. However, the album was delayed by a week in May's home-country the Republic of Ireland, and rescheduled to 21 April 2017 elsewhere."]}]}}
