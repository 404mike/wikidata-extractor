The UAPL attracted numerous leading figures from the southern unionist community, including Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore, Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh, John Arnott, Sir Maurice Dockrell and Valentine Browne, 5th Earl of Kenmare. Among the UAPL's more prominent members was William Morgan Jellett, KC,P\u00e1draig Yeates, Dublin: A City in Turmoil: Dublin 1919 - 1921 (Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 28 Sep 2012) who was MP for Dublin University 28 July 1919\u20131922. However, the majority of ordinary southern unionists remained with the IUA, which was left without effective leadership outside Northern Ireland following the split. The UAPL developed into a think-tank, with a focus on minority rights and constitutional affairs. The group argued against Sinn F\u00e9in's policy of absenteeism from the British parliament, believing that it left Irish domestic interests without proper representation. The UAPL was supportive of the work of the Proportional Representation Society of Ireland, seeing proportional representation as a way of ensuring unionist voices were heard in government. In June 1919 the leadership of the League was approached by Sir Horace Plunkett, who invited them to join the new Irish Dominion League. The idea was rejected, as the Dominion League was perceived to be too sympathetic to Irish nationalism.Wells, Warre B, Irish Indiscretions (London: Allen & Unwin, 1922), 90. The establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 and the consequent decrease in the number of southern unionists resulted in the disestablishment of the League."]}, {"page": "Richard Walter John Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore"]}, {"page": "344th Moonlight Battery, Royal Artillery", "response": ["* Hon David Edward Hely-Hutchinson, born in 1911, second son of Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore.
