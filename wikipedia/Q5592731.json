During this time he became friendly with fellow racers Max Mosley and Alan Rees, and racing car designer Robin Herd. The four created March Engineering in mid-1969, the name of the team being derived from their initials: Max Mosley, Alan Rees, Graham Coaker, and Robin Herd. Coaker was responsible for the workshop and manufacturing side of the new company, drawing on many years of experience as general manager of one of Hawker Siddeley's automotive subsidiaries, and was the driving force behind March's move into the customer-car market. The company's first manufacturing premises were actually in Coaker's own garage and it was here that the first March racing car, the March 693P, was constructed.Coaker left March in early 1971, and received a March 712M Formula Two car as part of his settlement package. Unfortunately for him, Coaker died that April from sepsis caused by injuries sustained when he crashed the car during practice for a Formule Libre race at Silverstone Circuit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of companies named after people", "response": ["* March Engineering \u2013 initials of Max Mosley, Alan Rees, Graham Coaker, and Robin Herd"]}, {"page": "Max Mosley", "response": ["In 1969, after two large accidents due to breakages on his Lotus car, Mosley decided that \"it was evident that I wasn't going to be World Champion\" and retired from driving. He was already working with Robin Herd, Alan Rees, and Graham Coaker to establish the racing car manufacturer March Engineering where he handled legal and commercial matters. The name March is an acronym based on the initials of the founders; the 'M' stands for Mosley. Like the other founders, Mosley put in \u00a32,500 of capital.

In 1996 he and the other remaining founders sold Arrows to Tom Walkinshaw.

Its four founders were Max Mosley, Alan Rees, Graham Coaker and Robin Herd. The company name is an acronym of their initials - \"M\"osley, \"A\"lan \"R\"ees, \"C\"oaker, and \"H\"erd. They each had a specific area of expertise: Mosley looked after the commercial side, Herd was the designer, Rees managed the racing team and Coaker oversaw production at the factory in Bicester, Oxfordshire. The history of March is dominated by the conflict between the need for constant development and testing to remain at the peak of competitiveness in F1 and the need to build simple, reliable cars for customers in order to make a profit. Herd's original F1 plan was to build a single-car team around Jochen Rindt, but Rindt became dismayed at the size of the March programme and elected to continue at Team Lotus."]}, {"page": "Robin Herd", "response": ["He was recruited by McLaren in 1965, having been alerted to an engineering vacancy with the constructor by former school friend and racing driver Alan Rees, and worked on cars, such as the Mallite-bodied M2A test car for the Firestone tire company. The M2A subsequently evolved into the Formula One M2B car. Herd stayed with McLaren until 1968 \u2014 during which time he designed their M4B, M5A and M7 Formula One cars, as well as the successful M6A Can-Am car \u2014 before moving to Cosworth to design a four-wheel drive F1 car. He also carried out work for Frank Williams in late 1969, modifying Williams' Brabham BT26 to take a Ford Cosworth DFV to enter Piers Courage in Formula One. He co-founded March Engineering with Max Mosley, Alan Rees and Graham Coaker in 1969. The team completed 207 Formula One Grand Prix races between 1970 and 1992, winning three with four pole positions. In addition they enjoyed a great deal of success in Formula Two, and in the 1980s they made a successful foray into Indycars, with March cars winning the Indianapolis 500 for five successive years from 1983 to 1987."]}, {"page": "March 701", "response": ["March Engineering was set up in September 1969 by amateur racing drivers Max Mosley, Alan Rees and Graham Coaker, with engineer and former McLaren and Cosworth racing car designer Robin Herd. After producing their first prototype, the 693P, in Coaker's garage Max Mosley announced that March would enter a car for the first Grand Prix of the 1970 Formula One season. Designer Robin Herd started work on the car in November 1969, and by the 701's official press launch on 6 February 1970 two cars had been finished and were ready to run. In order to complete the car in the short time available Herd had been forced to take a \"British Standard\" conservative approach and held over more advanced features for the 701's 1971 successor, the March 711. L. J. K. Setright, writing in Car Magazine, described the 701 as \"a Chinese copy of a McLaren Lotus\" and suggested that \"to make a better 1967 car in 1970 is just being wise after the event.\" Interviewed in 2010, Herd stated that at the time he was \"disillusioned by the 701, because it was nothing like the car I wanted to build.\" The stress and workload involved with getting the car finished to Mosley's ambitious deadline meant that Herd lost over a stone and half in weight."]}, {"page": "Coaker", "response": ["*Graham Coaker (1932\u20131971), British engineer and businessman"]}]}}
