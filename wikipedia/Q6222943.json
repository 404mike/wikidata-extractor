The antiquary John Brand claimed that in Elizabethan and Jacobean-era England they were known as minched pies, but other names include mutton pie, and starting in the following century, Christmas pie.  Gervase Markham's 1615 recipe recommends taking \"a leg of mutton\", and cutting \"the best of the flesh from the bone\", before adding mutton suet, pepper, salt, cloves, mace, currants, raisins, prunes, dates and orange peel.  He also suggested that beef or veal might be used in place of mutton.  In the north of England, goose was used in the pie's filling, but more generally beef tongue was also used; a North American filling recipe published in 1854 includes chopped neat's tongue, beef suet, bloom raisins, currants, mace, cloves, nutmeg, brown sugar, apples, lemons, brandy and orange peel.  During the English Civil War, along with the censure of other Catholic customs, they were banned: \"Nay, the poor rosemary and bays, and Christmas pie, is made an abomination.\"Quote taken from , and reproduced in   Puritans were opposed to the Christmas pie, on account of its connection with Catholicism.
