These ideas were important parts of the British contribution to physiology, which at that time led the world.\nHe made at least four significant contributions: 1. In the capillary, water is forced out through the pores in the wall by hydrostatic pressure and driven in by the osmotic pressure of plasma proteins (or oncotic pressure). These opposing forces approximately balance; which is known as Starling's Principle. 2. The discovery of the hormone secretin\u2014with his brother-in-law William Bayliss\u2014and the introduction of the word hormone. 3. The analysis of the heart's activity as a pump, which is known as the Frank\u2013Starling law. 4. Several fundamental observations on the action of the kidneys. These include evidence for the existence of vasopressin, the anti-diuretic hormone. He also wrote the leading textbook of physiology in English, which ran through 20 editions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 17", "response": ["*1866 \u2013 Ernest Starling, English physiologist and academic (d. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Endocrinology", "response": ["In 1902 William Bayliss and Ernest Starling performed an experiment in which they observed that acid instilled into the duodenum caused the pancreas to begin secretion, even after they had removed all nervous connections between the two.

In humans and other mammals, peristalsis is found in the smooth muscles of the digestive tract to propel contents through the digestive system.  The word is derived from New Latin and comes from the Greek peristallein, \"to wrap around,\" from peri-, \"around\" + stallein, \"to place\".  Peristalsis was discovered in 1899 by the work of physiologists William Bayliss and Ernest Starling.  Working on the small intestines of dogs, they found that the response of increasing the pressure in the intestine caused the contraction of the muscle wall above the point of stimulation and the relaxation of the muscle wall below the point of stimulation."]}, {"page": "Secretin", "response": ["Secretin was the first hormone to be identified. In 1902, William Bayliss and Ernest Starling were studying how the nervous system controls the process of digestion.

They discovered (by cutting all the nerves to the pancreas in their experimental animals) that this process was not, in fact, governed by the nervous system. They determined that a substance secreted by the intestinal lining stimulates the pancreas after being transported via the bloodstream. They named this intestinal secretion secretin.

Writings of ancient civilizations include evidence of their acquaintance with dropsy and heart failure: Egyptians were the first to use bloodletting to relieve fluid accumulation and shortage of breath, and provided what may have been the first documented observations on heart failure in the Ebers papurus (around 1500 BCE); Greeks described cases of dyspnea, fluid retention and fatigue compatible with heart failure; Romans used the flowering plant Drimia maritima (sea squill), which contains cardiac glycosides, for the treatment of dropsy; descriptions pertaining to heart failure are also known in the civilizations of ancient India and China. However, the manifestations of failing heart were understood in the context of these peoples' medical theories - including ancient Egyptian religion, Hippocratic theory of humours, or ancient Indian and Chinese medicine, and the current concept of heart failure had not developed yet. Although shortage of breath had been connected to heart disease by Avicenna round 1000 CE, decisive for modern understanding of the nature of the condition were the description of pulmonary circulation by Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century, and of systemic circulation by William Harvey in 1628. The role of the heart in fluid retention began to be better appreciated, as dropsy of the chest (fluid accumulation in and round the lungs causing shortage of breath) became more familiar and the current concept of heart failure, which brings together swelling and shortage of breath due to fluid retention, began to be accepted, in the 17th and especially in the 18th century: Richard Lower linked dyspnea and foot swelling in 1679, and Giovanni Maria Lancisi connected jugular vein distention with right venticular failure in 1728. Dropsy attributable to other causes, e.g. kidney failure, was differentiated in the 19th century. The stethoscope, invented by Ren\u00e9 Laennec in 1819, x-rays, discovered by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen in 1895, and electrocardiography, described by Willem Einthoven in 1903, facilitated the investigation of heart failure. 19th century also saw experimental and conceptual advances in the physiology of heart contraction, which led to the formulation of the Frank-Starling law of the heart (named after physiologists Otto Frank and Ernest Starling, a remarkable advance in understanding mechanisms of heart failure."]}, {"page": "1902 in science", "response": ["* William Bayliss and Ernest Starling make the first discovery of a hormone, secretin."]}, {"page": "1866 in science", "response": ["* April 17 \u2013 Ernest Starling (died 1927), English physiologist"]}, {"page": "1927 in science", "response": ["* May 2 \u2013 Ernest Starling (born 1866), English physiologist."]}, {"page": "Otto Loewi", "response": ["Otto Loewi (; 3 June 1873 \u2013 25 December 1961) was a German-born pharmacologist and psychobiologist who discovered the role of acetylcholine as an endogenous neurotransmitter.

This law states that \"Within physiological limits, the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber\". Frank also undertook important work into the physiological basis of the arterial pulse waveform and may have coined the term essential hypertension in 1911. His work on the Windkessel extended the original ideas of Stephen Hales and provided a sound mathematical framework for this approach. Frank also published on waves in the arterial system but his attempts to produce a theory that incorporated waves and the Windkessel are not considered to have been successful.
