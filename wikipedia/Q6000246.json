They set off from Irene on 28 June 1930 in a convoy of seven vehicles and were joined at Beit Bridge by Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans. They collected all the way to Lake Tanganyika and then retraced their route to Broken Hill, where Hutchinson boarded a goods train to Elizabethville (Lubumbashi). On his return to Pretoria, and with time in hand, he set off on a trip to the Soutpansberg with Jan Gillett. Then followed a week in the Drakensberg, climbing to the top of Mont-aux-Sources with two fellow botanists, Ms. Verdoorn and Ms. Forbes. A final flurry of collecting at Botha's Hill near Durban, and Port Elizabeth, saw the end of a fruitful visit."]}, {"page": "List of authors of South African botanical taxa", "response": ["*Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans (1879\u20131968) M, S ........

One of the network of botanical and research stations set up by the Botanical Survey was situated in the Mapungubwe area. At the request of General Smuts, the government set aside a block of nine farms in this area as a preserve for wildlife and natural vegetation in 1918. A few years later this became known as the Dongola Botanical Reserve."]}, {"page": "I. B.

Her collecting led to a regular correspondence with botanists such as Peter MacOwan, Harry Bolus, HHW Pearson, Selmar Schonland and Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans. Her meticulous notes on the Kentani plants throughout the seasons were published in Ann. Bol. Herb. 5: 1-32 (1918). She did not confine herself to the flora, but also collected beetles, gall flies, spiders, and scorpions. In 1903, she travelled to the Transvaal and collected between Rustenburg and Johannesburg. Her failing health eventually caused her to specialise in algae and fungi. An enumeration of the fungi she collected in 1911-14 in the Kentani district was published in Ann. Bol. Herb. 2: 184-93 (1918). Bolus paid tribute to her collecting in Vol. 2 of his Orchids of South Africa (1911) and described her as someone \"who, in spite of delicate health, has been indefatigable in exploring the flora of her neighbourhood.\" In the seven years preceding her death, she became a helpless invalid. Her specimens which numbered 2 000 were donated to the South African National Botanical Institute in Pretoria."]}, {"page": "Pole-Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans"]}, {"page": "Iltyd Buller Pole-Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans"]}, {"page": "1921 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans, , Chief of the Division of Botany and Plant Pathology, Department of Agriculture, Union of South Africa."]}, {"page": "Aloe globuligemma", "response": ["First description by Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans published in 1915.Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa.
