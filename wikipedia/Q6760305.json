Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games: Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Kokona Hiraki are younger. In July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal. Brown won the bronze medal in the women\u2019s park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain\u2019s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She had fallen over in her first two runs at the event, and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Kokona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event. Later in the year, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London."]}]}}
