Over the course of a 15-year career in the Football League, he had notable spells with Brentford and Millwall. He won England B international caps while with Millwall and is a member of the club's Hall of Fame.

Ian Branfoot succeeded Nicholl as manager in June 1991, and considered that the club could dispense with Case's services and he was transferred to AFC Bournemouth within a few days of Branfoot's appointment, a decision that proved very unpopular with to Saints fans, especially when Case was replaced by the unsuccessful Terry Hurlock, and was one of the key reasons that Branfoot was an unpopular figure with the club's supporters during his two and a half years in charge."]}, {"page": "The Den", "response": ["The Den hosted the Samaritans Celebrity Soccer Sixes on 18 May 2008.

However, in October 1981 he was again transferred after Brentford manager Fred Callaghan agreed to a swap deal with David Crown going the other way. Kamara was paired with Terry Hurlock in a highly committed central midfield partnership at Griffin Park. He settled in well during the 1981\u201382 campaign and scored a career best of 11 goals in the 1982\u201383 season as Brentford posted two top ten finishes. The club then struggled to just one place above the Third Division relegation zone in 1983\u201384 before rising to 13th place in 1984\u201385. He won a Football League Trophy runners-up medal in 1985, playing at Wembley in a 3\u20131 defeat by Wigan Athletic. He took the decision to leave the club in summer 1985 after he rejected manager Frank McLintock's offer of a new one-year contract on the same terms."]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)", "response": ["Season 1990\u201391 saw Celtic's league fortunes fall away fairly quickly, despite their centre-back Paul Elliott being voted Players' Player of the Year. They did reach the Skol Cup Final in October only to be beaten in extra time by Rangers.  In December 1990, Celtic appointed their first ever Chief Executive, Terry Cassidy.  Cassidy had an impressive background but his abrasive nature did not go down well in Scottish football.  On the pitch, Celtic gained a modicum of revenge over Rangers for their earlier Skol Cup Final defeat in a 1991 Scottish Cup quarter-final tie with their rivals, beating them 2\u20130 through Gerry Creaney and Dariusz Wdowczyk goals. It was a wild St. Patrick's Day encounter which saw three Rangers players (Terry Hurlock, Mark Walters and Mark Hateley) and one Celtic player (Peter Grant) get the red card. However, the joy was short-lived as Motherwell knocked them out of the semi-final 4\u20132."]}, {"page": "West London derby", "response": ["* Terry Hurlock \u2013 first Brentford, then Fulham."]}]}}
