His books included The Game of Cricket and the ghost-written memoirs of the cricketer Robert Grimston. As a journalist and columnist he contributed to Baily's Magazine of Sports and Pastimes, continuing to write until his death.Gale was born at Woodborough in Wiltshire, the son of a Church of England clergyman who was rector of Godmersham between 1829 and 1864. He was educated at Winchester College. He played in the Winchester cricket XI and later as an amateur cricketer for a variety of teams, including teams representing Surrey, but his two matches for Kent County Cricket Club and the Gentlemen of Kent in 1845 are the only ones to have been accorded first-class status.Living for many years at Mitcham in Surrey, Gale took a keen interest in Surrey County Cricket Club. He married Claudia Severn in 1852; the couple had a son and four daughters. Gale moved to Manitoba in Canada in 1891 but later returned to England and was a visitor at The Oval until the year before his death. He died in 1904 at the age of 80 at the London Charterhouse in the City of London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lord's", "response": ["The Australian Aboriginal cricket team toured England in 1868, with Lord's hosting one of their matches to a mixed response, with The Times describing the tourists as \"a travestie upon cricketing at Lord's\" and \"the conquered natives of a convict colony\". Dark proposed to part with his interest in the ground in 1863, for the fee of \u00a315,000 for the remaining 29 and a half years of his lease. An agreement was reached in 1864, with Dark, who was seriously ill,Green 2010, p. 44 selling his interests at Lord's for \u00a311,000. The landlord of the ground, Isaac Moses, offered to sell it outright for \u00a321,000 in 1865, which was reduced to \u00a318,150. William Nicholson, who was a member of the MCC committee at the time advanced the money on a mortgage, with his proposal for the MCC to buy the ground being unanimously passed at a special general meeting on 2 May 1866. Following the purchase, a number of developments took place. These included the addition of cricket nets for players to practise and the construction of a grandstand designed by the architect Arthur Allom, which was built in the winter of 1867\u201368 and also provided accommodation for the press.Green 2010, p. 45Green 2010, p. 51 This was funded by a private syndicate of MCC members, from whom the MCC purchased the stand from in 1869. The condition of the Lord's wicket was heavily criticised in the 1860s due to its poor condition, with Frederick Gale suggesting nine cricket grounds out of ten within 20 miles of London would have a better wicket; the condition was deemed so poor as to be dangerous that Sussex refused to play there in 1864."]}, {"page": "Gale (surname)", "response": ["* Frederick Gale (1823\u20131904), English cricket writer and cricketer ", "* Walter Frederick Gale (1865\u20131945), Australian banker and astronomer"]}, {"page": "Bell's Life in London", "response": ["* cricket writer Frederick Gale (1823\u20131904)"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Frederick Gale"]}, {"page": "Fred Gale", "response": ["#REDIRECTFrederick Gale"]}]}}
