During his career, Lucas made over 400 appearances in The Football League during spells with Swindon Town, Swansea Town and Newport County and attained seven caps for Wales as well as eight wartime caps. After his retirement from playing, he went on to manage two of his former clubs, Newport County and Swansea Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newport County A.F.C.", "response": ["Billy Lucas had the first of three spells as Newport County manager from 1953 to 1961. County reached the fourth round of the 1956\u201357 FA Cup losing 2\u20130 to Arsenal in front of 20,000 spectators at Somerton Park. In the 1958\u201359 FA Cup County faced Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round. The game was played in heavy snow away at White Hart Lane, and although County lost 4\u20131 their goal came from an incredible 35-yard effort by defender Ken Hollyman. This made the score-line 1\u20132, giving County the hope that they could force an upset upon Bill Nicholson's men (who were double winners a year later). However, two late goals for Tottenham ended County's hopes of pulling off a shock result. County faced Tottenham again in the 1959\u201360 FA Cup third round at Somerton Park in front of a cup record 24,000 crowd, this time losing 4\u20130.", "In January 1964 under Billy Lucas in his second spell as manager, County took on another high-profile side \u2013 Burnley, the 1960 Division One champions and 1962 double runners-up \u2013 in the FA Cup fourth round, but again suffered defeat 2\u20131.", "In the 1970\u201371 season the Newport team managed by Bobby Ferguson set an unwanted Football League record by not winning any of their first 25 matches, losing 21 in the process. In the same season Newport equalled the worst defeat of a Football League club by a non-league club when they lost 6\u20131 to Barnet in the FA Cup First Round. Results improved in the following season under Billy Lucas in his third spell as manager and in the 1972\u201373 season Newport missed out on promotion only on goal average."]}, {"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["He returned to Swansea in 1949, where manager Billy McCandless had already received offers for Allchurch even though he had not made his professional debut. Despite the interest, Allchurch joined a side that had won promotion comfortably from the Football League Third Division South the previous year and the favoured attacking partnership of Sammy McCrory and Billy Lucas meant that Allchurch continued to play for the club's reserve side in The Football Combination. He eventually received his first call up to the first team on Boxing Day 1949 at the age of 20, making his debut in a 3\u20130 defeat to West Ham United. Although the Swans lost, Allchurch impressed enough to be handed a second start on 7 January 1950, scoring his first senior goal for the club in a 3\u20130 victory over First Division side Birmingham City in the third round of the FA Cup. In the next round, Swansea suffered a 2\u20131 defeat to eventual winners Arsenal but Allchurch again made headlines for his performance with Arsenal player Joe Mercer later commenting that he \"nearly frightened us to death\" as McCandless and the Swansea board were again forced to fend off offers from several clubs. He also claimed a Welsh Cup winners' medal at the end of the 1949\u201350 season, playing in a 4\u20131 victory over Wrexham in the final on 27 April 1950.", "Swansea's troubles continued the following season, amassing just six points during the first third of the season and suffering a 5\u20131 aggregate defeat against Bulgarian side Slavia Sofia in the opening round of the European Cup Winners' Cup, with the club board accusing some players of a \"lack of effort\". Glyn Davies' contract as manager was cancelled by mutual consent and long serving club trainer Joe Sykes was temporarily appointed manager with Allchurch part of his selection committee. Sykes also handed the club captaincy to Allchurch, replacing Brian Purcell, but the club eventually suffered relegation to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1966\u201367 season. He remained with the club, entering the final year of his contract, but was switched to playing as a striker by manager Billy Lucas in order to lessen the amount of running required of Allchurch who had turned 38 during the opening months of the season. The change of position benefited him, scoring seventeen times in the league in forty matches. Approaching the end of the season, he was offered a one-year extension to his contract with the club, with a \u00a35 per week pay cut, but eventually decided to retire from professional football, making his final appearance on 6 May 1968 against Hartlepools United. He retired from professional football as Swansea's all-time record goalscorer. He later spent time playing non-league football with Worcester City and had a spell as player-manager of Haverfordwest County before ending his career at Pontardawe Athletic at the age of 50."]}, {"page": "Trevor Ford", "response": ["Ford was a keen cricketer from an early age and would often turn out for a team representing Aston Villa against local sides. In 1955, he turned out for Glamorgan Cricket Club in a charity benefit match for Allan Watkins against Abergavenny Cricket Club, playing alongside players such as Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Pressdee and Harold Gimblett. His Wales international teammates Billy Lucas and Alf Sherwood were also due to play in the match."]}]}}
