At the time of the establishment of the Church of England,  the Catholic Church would have invalidated consecrations of bishops by a prelate who recognized the supremacy of the English monarch and whose appointments lacked papal confirmation. Now, several centuries later, some hoped that a review in light of a contemporary understanding of grace that had developed in sacramental theology would support a different assessment. Leo's commission was equally divided between two opposing views, and Leo relied on his personal theologian, Cardinal Raffaele Pierotti, who was titled the Master of the Apostolic Palace, the role now called Theologian of the Pontifical Household. Pierotti held the negative position on the validity of Anglican orders and believed that reaffirmation of the invalidity of Anglican orders would result in many converts to Catholicism."]}, {"page": "George Lane-Fox, 1st Baron Bingley", "response": ["Lord Bingley married the Hon Mary Agnes Emily Wood (born 25 March 1877, died 25 March 1962), daughter of Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax and sister of E.
