Edward Thring of Uppingham School introduced major reforms, focusing on the importance of the individual and competition, as well as the need for a \"total curriculum\" with academia, music, sport and drama being central to education. Most public schools developed significantly during the 18th and 19th centuries, and came to play an important role in the development of the Victorian social elite. Under a number of forward-looking headmasters leading public schools created a curriculum based heavily on classics and physical activity for boys and young men of the upper and upper middle classes."]}, {"page": "Uppingham School", "response": ["Uppingham School is a public school (English independent day and boarding school for pupils 13-18) in Uppingham, Rutland, England, founded in 1584 by Robert Johnson, the Archdeacon of Leicester, who also established Oakham School. The headmaster, Richard J. Maloney, belongs to the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the school to the Rugby Group of British independent schools. Edward Thring was perhaps the school's best-known headmaster (in 1853\u20131887). His curriculum changes were adopted in other English public schools. John Wolfenden, headmaster from 1934 to 1944, chaired the Wolfenden Committee, whose report recommending the decriminalisation of homosexuality appeared in 1957. Uppingham has a musical tradition based on work by Paul David and Robert Sterndale Bennett. It has the biggest playing-field area of any school in England, in three separate areas of the town: Leicester to the west, Middle to the south, and Upper to the east.I Never Knew That About England, by Christopher Winn, Ebury Press, 2005", "Edward Thring transformed the school from a small, local grammar school into a large, well-known public school, with 330 pupils. During his headship on 4 April 1876 the entire school, consisting of 300 boys, 30 masters and their families, moved temporarily to Borth in Wales after an outbreak of typhoid ravaged the town as a result of the poorly maintained water system. In Borth the school took over the disused Cambrian Hotel and a number of boarding houses, for a period of 14 months. The move was successful in saving the school from a serious epidemic. The move to Borth is commemorated in an annual service, held in the school chapel.", "*1853\u20131887: Edward Thring (1821\u20131887) "]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 19th century", "response": ["* Edward Thring (1821\u20131887), Headmaster of Uppingham School, 1853\u20131887"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Edward Thring (King's), Headmaster of Uppingham School and founder of the Headmasters' Conference"]}, {"page": "Hardwicke Rawnsley", "response": ["Later in 1862, aged eleven, Rawnsley enrolled at Uppingham School, where his godfather, Edward Thring, was headmaster.Richardson, p. xiv  Thring became a major influence on him: Rawnsley excelled at athletics and gymnastics, but Thring encouraged his aesthetic side, particularly his budding gifts as a poet.Griffiths, pp. 68\u201369 The historian George Bott writes:"]}, {"page": "Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference", "response": ["The Conference dates from 1869 when Edward Thring, Headmaster of Uppingham, asked sixty to seventy of his fellow headmastersLeinster-Mackay, Donald P.
