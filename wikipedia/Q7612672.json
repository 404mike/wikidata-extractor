He made his First-class cricket debut for Kent the following September before being released by the county at the end of the 1987 season after only making five senior appearances for Kent.A move to Derbyshire for the start of the 1988 season saw Goldsmith play more regularly and he scored 1,071 runs in his first season with the county.
