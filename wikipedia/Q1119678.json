He won the British Superbike Championship in 1992, 2001 and 2004. Reynolds is an all-time great of BSB with his 37 career wins bettered only by Shane Byrne and Ryuichi Kiyonari. His 117 podiums is 2nd all time behind Byrne, what makes this mark impressive is Reynolds scored this in 202 starts. Making him one of a select few riders to finish on the podium in over half their career starts.\nHis first domestic success led him into the 500 cc World Championship on a Padgetts Harris-Yamaha, taking 8 top-10 finishes over two seasons. He joined Rev\u00e9 Kawasaki in World Superbikes for 1995, qualifying 2nd at Brands Hatch and taking 3rd-place finishes there and Assen, en route to 10th overall. In 1996 he rode a Suzuki to 12th overall. Although he never did a full season of international racing again, he had a strong record as an occasional rider in future years, taking a win at Brands Hatch in 2000 and a pole position in 2003.\nIn 1997. Reynolds returned to Rev\u00e9, now running Ducatis in the reformed British Superbike series with Red Bull backing. He was immediately a front-runner, finishing in the championship top 5 each year between 1997 and 2000. He took 13 BSB wins in those seasons, and scored points in every BSB race in 2000.\n\nThe dominant riders in 2000, together with Reynolds, had been Neil Hodgson and Chris Walker. With these two having moved on, the stage was set for Reynolds and Steve Hislop to duel in 2001, as only John\u2019s team-mate, Sean Emmett, and Michael Rutter also won races. Reynolds\u2019s second championship came when Hislop was injured in a collision between the two men.\nFor 2002 he moved to Suzuki's new 1000 cc four-cylinder bike, taking a win and six further podiums en route to 6th overall. He was championship runner-up in 2003, but was the fastest man by the end of the season. A run of 11 consecutive podiums at the start of 2004 made the title his to lose, and despite a less successful second half of the season he secured the title in the final round.\nReynolds broke his leg in testing before the 2005 BSB season. After a poor season, Reynolds had a serious accident at the final round at Brands Hatch during practice on 7 October, breaking four ribs on his right side, puncturing his right lung and breaking his left collarbone, and suffered injuries to his neck and back. Reynolds commented from hospital: \"When I hit the barrier it was like a switch in my head flipped. Instantly I knew it was time to stop. I had received a warning with my broken leg earlier in the year. I see this as a final warning and I\u2019ve made the decision to stop racing, more for my wife Shelley\u2019s sanity and for the good of my family than for me.\"After recovery, Reynolds took up a background role with Rizla Suzuki.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Reynolds", "response": ["John Reynolds may refer to:", "* John Reynolds (writer) (1588\u20131655), English merchant and writer", "* John Reynolds (died 1966) (1941\u20131966), American actor", "* John Reynolds (actor) (born 1991), American actor and writer", "* John Reynolds (musician), record producer, the first husband of singer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor", "* John Reynolds (Roundhead) (1625\u20131657), soldier in the English Civil War", "* John Reynolds (Royal Navy officer) (1713\u20131788), British naval officer and governor of the Province of Georgia", "* John Reynolds (Dublin politician) (1797\u20131868)", "* John Reynolds (Illinois politician) (1788\u20131865), American politician, governor of Illinois", "* John Reynolds (Canadian politician) (born 1942), Canadian politician from British Columbia", "* John Reynolds (1670\u20131699), Irish Member of Parliament", "* John Reynolds (agriculturist) (1703\u20131779), English farmer and agricultural innovator", "* John Reynolds (astronomer) (1874\u20131949), British astronomer", "* John Reynolds (physicist) (1923\u20132000), American physicist", "* John Reynolds (ecologist) (born 1959), Canadian ecologist", "* John Reynolds (motorcyclist) (born 1963), British motorcycle racer", "* John Reynolds (priest), English Anglican priest", "* John Reynolds Gardiner (1944\u20132006), American author and engineer"]}, {"page": "Mallory Park", "response": ["|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds", "|  John Reynolds"]}, {"page": "1993 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season", "response": ["|  John Reynolds", "|align=\"left\"|  John Reynolds"]}, {"page": "1993 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix", "response": ["Lap nine and fourth place Beattie is now closing the gap to Schwantz.
