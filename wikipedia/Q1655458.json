He is the Emeritus Professor of the School of Physics and Astronomy at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London.\nHe is one among the pioneers of quantum chaos and he is well known for his suggestion in the 1970s about the existence of a different type of spectra of quantum-mechanical systems due to classical chaos. Numerical explorations performed by other researchers clearly confirmed this idea later. In 1987, he came up with Franco Vivaldi algebraic number theory of quadratic number fields on the counting of periodic orbits in discrete chaotic dynamical systems ( the cats figure of Vladimir Arnold). Later on, he worked on the basics of quantum mechanics and the measurement process.\nTogether with Walter Strunz he suggested the properties of the quantum foam at the Planck scale, (similar to the movement of particles due to Brownian motion) in the wave function of an atom-beam interference.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser theorem", "response": ["Those KAM tori that are destroyed by perturbation become invariant Cantor sets, named Cantori by Ian C.
