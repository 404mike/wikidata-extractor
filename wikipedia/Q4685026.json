He is also the former Programme Director of the master's programme in Architectural History.Forty's main interest is in architecture's role in societies and cultural contexts. His research includes work on the design of consumer goods; on language and architecture; and on architecture, collective memory, and forgetting. As of lately, he is concerned with the history, aesthetics, and cultural significance of concrete as a construction material.In 2003, Forty was awarded the Sir Misha Black Award for Innovation in Design Education.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bartlett", "response": ["In 2011, the university appointed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Migayrou as the new Bartlett Professor of Architecture.

At that time two schools began to develop. Viennese Gottfried Semper in 1880 developed an architectural theory based the idea that the first impulse of architecture was the enclosure of space. Camillo Sitte extended Semper's ideas to exterior spaces in his City Planning According to Artistic Principles (1889). Concurrently, Friedrich Nietzsche built on ideas from Kant which emphasized the experience of space as a force field generated by human movement and perception. Martin Heidegger would later contradict both of these schools. In his 1927 Being and Time and 1951 \"Building, Dwelling, Thinking\" he claimed that space was neither a construct of the mind nor a given, but was \"that for which a room has been made\" and was created by the object within a room rather than the room itself. Henri Lefebvre would call all of this into question, linking designers' notions of themselves as space-makers to a subservience to a dominant capitalist mode of production. He felt that the abstract space they had created had destroyed social space through alienation, separation, and a privileging of the eye."]}, {"page": "Lino Bianco", "response": ["Bianco graduated in philosophy (under Peter Serracino Inglott) and in architecture (under Richard England) at the University of Malta.

"]}, {"page": "Design studies", "response": ["Margolin's argument triggered counter arguments and other suggestions about what constitutes design history and how to characterize the study of design as something more than a professional practice. In a reply to Margolin in the Journal of Design History, Adrian Forty argued that design history had consistently performed a vital role in examining questions around quality in design and was already embracing new lines of thought, for example from cultural studies and anthropology. The growing debate led to a special issue of the journal Design Issues in 1995 which focused attention on \u2018some of the controversies and problems that surround the seemingly simple task of telling the history of design\u2019.", "Adrian Forty. (born 1948) was Professor of Architectural History at The Bartlett, The Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London. Forty believed that the drive to define a new field, the field of design studies, was unnecessary due to the fact that the field of design history had not exhausted all of its possibilities. His book Objects of Desire explores how consumer goods relate to larger issues of social processes."]}]}}
