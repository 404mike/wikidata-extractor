However, as the club grew, the need was soon recognised to provide a more permanent home in the town. Plans were well advanced to build a separate clubhouse at Love Lane, when the Town Council decided to develop the Penns Place site at the edge of the town. The club moved to Penns Place in 1979;  the first clubhouse was a wooden structure which was irreparably damaged in the Great Storm of 1987.  In 1989 Frank Guy, the founder member, officially opened the current clubhouse with a celebratory match between a Petersfield XV and Derek White\u2019s Invitation XV being played.  At the beginning of the 2006-07 season, a new changing room block was opened.  This development was made necessary by the loss of the changing facility in the Taro Centre, which had been a key assumption in the design of the 1979 and 1989 clubhouses.  After several years where portable cabins were used for changing, the new development was achieved through the significant support of the Rugby Football Foundation,Rugby Football Foundation  grants and fundraising by Club members.", "Ex-Petersfield player Tim Rodber is one of the club's best known old boys, having gone on to be capped for England, and the British and Irish Lions.

Although a capable footballer, it was Milne's destiny to build up a reputation as a formidable scrummager; the type of man even the Paprembordes of the world thought twice about taking issue with. But then, as Milne himself says, it was his ability to provide a solid tight platform that would allow Scotland to play No. 8s such as Derek White and Iain Paxton in the second row so that they could play a more fluid style and get away with it.\""]}]}}
