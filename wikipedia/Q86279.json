Before the invention of the variometer, sailplane pilots found it very hard to soar.  Although they could readily detect abrupt changes in vertical speed (\"in the seat of the pants\"), their senses did not allow them to distinguish lift from sink, or strong lift from weak lift.  The actual climb/sink rate could not even be guessed at, unless there was some clear fixed visual reference nearby.  Being near a fixed reference means being near to a hillside, or to the ground.  Except when hill-soaring (exploiting the lift close to the up-wind side of a hill), these are generally very unprofitable positions for glider pilots to be in.  The most useful forms of lift (thermal and wave lift) are found at higher altitudes and it is very hard for a pilot to detect or exploit them without the use of a variometer.  After the variometer was invented in 1929 by Alexander Lippisch and Robert Kronfeld, the sport of gliding moved into a new realm."]}, {"page": "4th World Scout Jamboree", "response": ["This event was notable as the first international gathering where Air Scouts were represented, including the famous pilots, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Robert Kronfeld.
