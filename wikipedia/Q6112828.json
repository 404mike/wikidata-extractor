Coventry took a 3\u20130 lead with second-half goals from Jordan Willis, Jordan Shipley and Jack Grimmer, eventually winning the game 3\u20131. This resulted in their first promotion for 51 years since being guided into the First Division by Hill in 1967. They had a solid season back in League One for 2018\u201319 finishing in eighth position.

He was publicly praised by Adams for his performance in the match, and Davis told the Sentinel that \"I'm hoping to cement my place and get myself going again.\" He earned a place on the Football League team of the week for his performance as \"a commanding figure\" in a 0\u20130 draw at Shrewsbury Town on 15 February."]}]}}
