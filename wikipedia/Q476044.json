In 1936 Rad\u00f3 formed Geopress, a news agency specialising in maps and geographic information as a cover for intelligence work, and after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the business began to flourish. In 1940, Rad\u00f3 met Alexander Foote, an English Soviet agent, who joined Ursula Kuczynski's network in 1938, and who would become the most important radio operator for Rad\u00f3's network. In March 1942, Rad\u00f3 made contact with Rudolf Roessler who would become the most important source of information. Roessler was able to provide prompt access to the secrets of the German High Command. This included the pending details of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union and many more, over a period of two years. A 1949 study by MI5 concluded that Roessler was a true mercenary who demanded payments for his reports that ran into thousands of Swiss francs over the course of the war year. This resulted in D\u00fcbendorfer being continually short of money, as Soviet intelligence insisted the link be maintained.", "* The third station was built by Alexander Foote that was hidden insider a typewriter. The transmitter was located in Lausanne at Chemin de Longeraie 2. Red Army Caption Foote was paid 1300 francs per month.", ":The British born Soviet agent Alexander Foote was the groups treasurer and paid the entire network. Foote carefully prepared a yearly budget and the following years monies were paid out in one or two lump sums, sent by a courier. Ten-thousand dollars was the common sum that was paid to agents on first entering a country. The Soviets were considered by American intelligence to be generous in their payments to agents. Some parts of the network were self-sufficient, for example, the cover companies, Simex and Simexco.
