Music historian Vernon Joynson said new wave emerged in the UK in late 1976, when many bands began disassociating themselves from punk. That year, the term gained currency when it appeared in UK punk fanzines such as Sniffin' Glue, and music weeklies such as Melody Maker and New Musical Express.Gendron, Bernard (2002). Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press), pp. 269\u2013270. In November 1976, Caroline Coon used Malcolm McLaren's term \"new wave\" to designate music by bands that were not exactly punk but were related to the punk-music scene.Clinton Heylin, Babylon's Burning (Conongate, 2007), pp. 140, 172. The mid-1970s British pub rock scene was the source of many of the most-commercially-successful new wave acts, such as Ian Dury, Nick Lowe, Eddie and the Hot Rods, and Dr. Feelgood.Adams, Bobby. \"Nick Lowe: A Candid Interview\", Bomp magazine, January 1979, reproduced at .

From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the \"Bromley Contingent\", as most of them came from the Bromley area in south east London, a label Severin came to despise. \"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \"The Lord's Prayer\"."]}, {"page": "The Clash", "response": ["Their politics were made explicit in the lyrics of such early recordings as \"White Riot\", which encouraged disaffected white youths to riot like their black counterparts; \"Career Opportunities\", which addressed the alienation of low-paid, routinised jobs and discontent over the lack of alternatives; and \"London's Burning\", about the bleakness and boredom of life in the inner city.Gray (2004), pp. 145\u2013146, 158\u2013159, 169\u2013171. Artist Caroline Coon, who was associated with the punk scene, argued that \"[t]hose tough, militaristic songs were what we needed as we went into Thatcherism\".

NME. 16 October 1976. Retrieved 8 August 2013 The same year also saw punk rock arrive on what some people perceived to be a stagnant music scene. The NME gave the Sex Pistols their first music press coverage in a live review of their performance at the Marquee in February that year, but overall it was slow to cover this new phenomenon in comparison to Sounds and Melody Maker, where Jonh Ingham and Caroline Coon respectively were early champions of punk. Although articles by the likes of Mick Farren (whose article \"The Titanic Sails at Dawn\" called for a new street-led rock movement in response to stadium rock) were published by the NME that summer, it was felt that younger writing was needed to credibly cover the emerging punk movement, and the paper advertised for a pair of \"hip young gunslingers\" to join their editorial staff. This resulted in the recruitment of Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill. The pair rapidly became champions of the punk scene and created a new tone for the paper. Parsons' time at NME is reflected in his 2005 novel Stories We Could Tell, about the misadventures of three young music-paper journalists on the night of 16 August 1977 \u2013 the night Elvis Presley died."]}, {"page": "Bromley Contingent", "response": ["The Bromley Contingent were a group of followers of the Sex Pistols.

Although it failed to make any commercial headway with its initial release in late 1982, the film became a cult favorite on 1980s cable television, particularly the late-night series Night Flight. Its reputation grew, and it is considered an influence on the feminist riot grrl movement. The film continues to be celebrated at film festivals and specialty theaters.", "In the mid-1970s, Caroline Coon was working as a Melody Maker music journalist and had earned a reputation as an early proponent of punk rock. Dowd, who was interested in writing a script about the new movement, contacted her and made an exploratory visit to London. Coon told Dowd that feminism was \"the next big thing to come in punk rock\", and the two began collaborating on the storyline to a film."]}, {"page": "Siouxsie Sioux", "response": ["At 17, she left school.

Siouxsie did not attend, but one of her friends told her how they sounded like the Stooges, and that singer Johnny Rotten had threatened students attending the gig.

Sinclair soon dropped out of the group and was replaced by New Zealand-born keyboard player and composer Dave MacRae, who had already played a guest role on the first album.  Their second album, Matching Mole's Little Red Record produced by Robert Fripp of King Crimson was released in November 1972.
