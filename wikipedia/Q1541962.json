Certain resolutions of these paradoxes, particularly Graham Priest's dialetheism as formalised in LP, have the law of excluded middle as a theorem, but resolve out the Liar as both true and false. In this way, the law of excluded middle is true, but because truth itself, and therefore disjunction, is not exclusive, it says next to nothing if one of the disjuncts is paradoxical, or both true and false.", "In modern mathematical logic, the excluded middle has been shown to result in possible self-contradiction. It is possible in logic to make well-constructed propositions that can be neither true nor false; a common example of this is the \"Liar's paradox\",Graham Priest, \"Paradoxical Truth\", The New York Times, November 28, 2010. the statement \"this statement is false\", which can itself be neither true nor false. The law of excluded middle still holds here as the negation of this statement \"This statement is not false\", can be assigned true. In set theory, such a self-referential paradox can be constructed by examining the set \"the set of all sets that do not contain themselves\". This set is unambiguously defined, but leads to a Russell's paradox:Kevin C. Klement,  does the set contain, as one of its elements, itself? However, in the modern Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, this type of contradiction is no longer admitted."]}, {"page": "Liar paradox", "response": ["Another reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as Graham Priest has, that the statement is both true and false.

Beall and Bradley Armour-Garb, have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as dialetheism. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized principle of explosion, which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism \u2013 the view that all propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle. Logics that reject it are called paraconsistent."]}, {"page": "Proof by contradiction", "response": ["The discovery of contradictions at the foundations of mathematics at the beginning of the 20th century, such as Russell's paradox, threatened the entire structure of mathematics due to the principle of explosion. This motivated a great deal of work during the 20th century to create consistent axiomatic systems to provide a logical underpinning for mathematics. This has also led a few philosophers such as Newton da Costa, Walter Carnielli and Graham Priest to reject the principle of non-contradiction, giving rise to theories such as paraconsistent logic and dialethism, which accepts that there exist statements that are both true and false."]}, {"page": "G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems", "response": ["* Graham Priest, 1984, \"Logic of Paradox Revisited\", Journal of Philosophical Logic, v. 13,` n. 2,  pp.\u00a0153\u2013179."]}, {"page": "Contradiction", "response": ["Adherents of the epistemological theory of coherentism typically claim that as a necessary condition of the justification of a belief, that belief must form a part of a logically non-contradictory system of beliefs.

Pluralism about logical consequence says that because different logical systems have different logical consequence relations, there is therefore more than one correct logic. For example, classical logic holds that the argument from explosion is a valid argument, but in Graham Priest's paraconsistent logic\u2014LP, the 'Logic of Paradox'\u2014it is an invalid argument.
