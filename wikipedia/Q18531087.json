The existing cup is reputed to be a \"Coronation Cup\", the unique vessel from which the monarch drank during the coronation feast, which by tradition was presented to the Lord Mayor, who customarily served the monarch as Chief Butler on that occasion.  Henry VIII, for example, had presented such a cup to Stephen Jenyns at the feast of 1509, who was assisted by twelve men of the Livery Companies: he presented another to the King's Champion.R.

Bowes himself was not Lord Mayor at the time of any of the coronations: his mayoralty ended about three months before the coronation of Edward VI (February 1547). William Chaffers stated that Bowes was Butler at Queen Elizabeth's coronation.Noticing that Bowes was not Mayor at Elizabeth's coronation, he attributed that dignity to Sir William Hewett, when in fact Sir Thomas Leigh was Lord Mayor.
