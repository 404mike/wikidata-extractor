He saw Eddisbury as a good opportunity to defeat the government candidate and enlisted John Eric Loverseed to be his own party's candidate. Loverseed was a 33-year-old fighter pilot with the RAF who had fought in the Battle of Britain and before that, on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. He was the son of a former Liberal MP, John Frederick Loverseed. However, he had no connection with the constituency, unlike the other two candidates."]}]}}
