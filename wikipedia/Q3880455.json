She reached a career-high world ranking of World No. 5 in 2005. In 2008, she finished runner-up at the World Open, losing in the final to Nicol David 11\u20135, 1\u201311, 6\u201311, 9\u201311. Botwright was a member of the England team which won the World Team Championships in 2006.Botwright caused a controversy which gained considerable media attention in 2004, when she announced plans to appear on court at tournaments wearing in a bikini-style outfit consisting of a sports bra and thong briefs, and posed for photographs wearing the outfit. However the Women's International Squash Players Association (WISPA), refused to grant permission for her to play in the outfit. Her popularity and fame increased after the incident, though afterwards she stated that the whole idea of \"skimpy\" clothing on-court was a publicity stunt dreamed up by the members of WISPA. She went on to say that she was selected as the player to wear the clothing. She also said that this was not her idea at all, and that she did not think the incident would become so infamous.\nBotwright now works as a squash coach having retired from the international tour in October 2008. She continues to make appearances as a player in Premier League Squash in England.\nVicky is the elder sister of Becky Botwright, who is also a squash player.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Squash Championships", "response": ["|  Vicky Botwright"]}, {"page": "Nicol David", "response": ["|  Vicky Botwright", "| bgcolor=\"98FB98\" | Winner || 2008 ||  Vicky Botwright || 5\u201311, 11\u20131, 11\u20136, 11\u20139"]}, {"page": "Vanessa Atkinson", "response": ["|   bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 2005 ||  Vicky Botwright   || 9-7, 9-4, 9-2"]}, {"page": "Rachael Grinham", "response": ["The first half of 2002 did not go well for Rachael until she beat England's Tania Bailey for the Singapore Open.
