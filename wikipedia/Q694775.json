A former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician, he represented South Antrim and Mid Ulster as their Member of Parliament (MP), representing Mid Ulster from 1983 to 1997; then South Antrim between 2000 to 2001, and then again from 2005 to 2015.

Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the deadline attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge).Sydney Elliott & William D Flackes. Conflict in Northern Ireland: An Encyclopedia. Abc-Clio Incorporated, 1999. p.92. McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's \"mythical stature\" amongst loyalists \"provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF\" in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: \"I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what I believe is happening in Ulster. But all I would like to say is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'\".Ireland Revisited Week 21. The Examiner. Paul Malone. 8 February 2011.  Retrieved 2 October 2011 Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William McCrea"]}, {"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*William McCrea, Baron McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William McCrea"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 2nd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|William McCrea", "|William McCrea"]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* William McCrea, DUP MP and MLA."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Rev.
