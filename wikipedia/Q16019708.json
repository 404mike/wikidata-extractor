His strongest event was the 3000 m steeplechase, a discipline at which he represented his country in the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nHolden's best performance in the steeplechase was 8:26.4 in September 1972, setting a British record. His time was still in the national all-time top 20 at the time of his death 42 years later. After his track career ended, Holden switched to road racing, where he continued to race in the veteran categories for many years. His best of 28:29 for the 10 km road race is a British record for over-35s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1972 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Andy Holden"]}, {"page": "1979 IAAF World Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Andy Holden || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 20"]}, {"page": "Holden (surname)", "response": ["* Andy Holden (footballer) (born 1962), Welsh footballer", "* Andy Holden (artist) (born 1982), English artist", "* Andy Holden (athlete) (1948\u20132014), English long-distance runner John Andrew Holden"]}, {"page": "1976 IAAF World Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=left style=\"border:0\"| (Andy Holden) || align=right style=\"border:0\"| (112)"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 5 ||align=left| Andy Holden ||align=left|  || 8:33.8||"]}, {"page": "John Holden", "response": ["*Andy Holden (athlete) (John Andrew Holden, 1948\u20132014), English long-distance runner"]}, {"page": "1981 European Marathon Cup", "response": ["|26 ||align=left|Andy Holden ||align=left| || 2:21:53"]}, {"page": "1968 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|   5 || Andy Holden ||  || 21:07,2", "|align=center|  1 || align=left |  || align=left | John BednarskiDon FairclothAndy Holden || 10"]}, {"page": "1969 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  24 || Andy Holden ||  || 38:12"]}, {"page": "1971 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  17 || Andy Holden ||  || 39:57.2", "|align=center|  1 || align=left |  || align=left | Dave BedfordTrevor WrightPeter StandingTony SimmonsFrank BriscoeAndy Holden || 56"]}, {"page": "1976 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Senior men's race", "response": ["|align=center| 112 || align=left | Andy Holden || align=left |  || 37:35", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| (Andy Holden) || align=right style=\"border:0\"| (112)"]}, {"page": "1979 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Senior men's race", "response": ["|align=center|  20 || align=left | Andy Holden || align=left |  || 38:20", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Andy Holden || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 20"]}, {"page": "1984 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Senior men's race", "response": ["|align=center|  69 || align=left | Andy Holden || align=left |  || 34:50", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Andy Holden || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 69"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2014", "response": ["*Andy Holden, 65, English Olympic long distance runner (1972).Tipton Harriers legend Andy Holden dies"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 January \u2013 Andy Holden, 65, long-distance runner."]}, {"page": "1971 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 6 || align=left | Andy Holden || align=left |  || 8:36.11 || "]}, {"page": "Andy Holden", "response": ["Andy Holden may refer to:", "* Andy Holden (footballer) (born 1962), Welsh footballer", "* Andy Holden (athlete) (1948\u20132014), English long-distance runner", "* Andy Holden (artist) (born 1982), English artist"]}, {"page": "Andrew Holden (athlete)", "response": ["#REDIRECTAndy Holden (athlete)"]}, {"page": "England at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Andy Holden\t||3,000m steeplechase||\t"]}, {"page": "List of British champions in 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["|Andy Holden", "|Andy Holden"]}, {"page": "John Andrew Holden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Holden (athlete)"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1970 Summer Universiade \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["|Andy Holden", "|  || align=left| Andy Holden ||align=left|  || 8:36.6 ||"]}]}}
