McCoig (1937\u20131998) was a Scottish badminton player who won numerous national and international titles from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s. Though he captured a record fifteen Scottish National singles titles, as well as several Scottish Open singles titles, his greatest international victories came in doubles. He was especially successful in three North American forays which yielded a pair of U.S. Open men's doubles titles (1963, 1965), a pair of Canadian Open men's doubles titles (1963, 1969), and the mixed doubles title of each nation in 1965. With Muriel Woodcock (n\u00e9e Ferguson) McCoig was runner-up in mixed doubles at the prestigious All-England Championships in 1968. He represented Scotland in seven consecutive Thomas Cup (men's international team) campaigns from 1957 to 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Erland Kops", "response": ["| Robert McCoig", "| align=\"left\" | Robert McCoig", "| align=\"left\" | Robert McCoig", "| align=\"left\" | Robert McCoig", "| align=\"left\" | Claude Lamere Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Games medallists in badminton", "response": ["| Mixed doubles ||  Roger Mills   Angela Bairstow ||  Tony Jordan   Helen Horton ||  Robert McCoig   Muriel Ferguson"]}, {"page": "Finn Kobber\u00f8", "response": ["| Erland Kops Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "Thomas Kihlstr\u00f6m", "response": ["| Fraser Gow Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "Welsh International", "response": ["|  Roger Mills Robert McCoig", "|  Robert McCoig McCoig"]}, {"page": "Bengt Fr\u00f6man", "response": ["| Fraser Gow Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "Margaret Beck", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "J\u00f8rgen Hammergaard Hansen", "response": ["| Erland Kops Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "Channarong Ratanaseangsuang", "response": ["| Erland Kops Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "Raphi Kanchanaraphi", "response": ["| Erland Kops Robert McCoig"]}, {"page": "Charoen Wattanasin", "response": ["| Tony Jordan Robert McCoig"]}]}}
