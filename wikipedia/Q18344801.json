The 1911 UK Census records him living in that town with his parents, John George Westgarth, a coal miner, and Mary Alice, and his five surviving siblings.He played football for Northern League club Stockton, and signed for Third Division North club Darlington in March 1931. He made his debut in the Football League on 28 March, replacing Jack Hill at centre forward for the visit to Chesterfield. He scored his first and what proved to be only League goal in a 4\u20132 win against local rivals Hartlepools United a week later. By the start of the following season, he was playing on the wing. His Darlington career ended that season, after 11 appearances, and he returned to non-league football with Shildon.Westgarth died in County Durham in 1972 at the age of 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reuben Vine", "response": ["In September, Vine was left out of the side for two matches to accommodate triallist Tommy Duff, who was not taken on, but was a regular thereafter until he was injured during a match against York City in March 1931. He regained fitness, but not his place, George Hurst being preferred initially, and then newcomer Mike Westgarth. Vine returned in place of the injured Westgarth to score the only goal after two minutes of the visit to Southport on 11 April, but it was Westgarth who completed the season."]}]}}
