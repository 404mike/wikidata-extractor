Born in India, he was educated at Liverpool University, and worked initially with local authorities in the south of England. In 1959 he took a post as senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, and was appointed Professor of Urban Design and Regional Planning in 1964.\nIn 1962 he founded the planning consultancy Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates, which was commissioned to masterplan the University of Edinburgh's Comprehensive Development Area in the 1960s. The practice was involved in urban planning and redevelopment in the UK and abroad. He is well known for being the main Architect of Celtic Park.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celtic Park", "response": ["The detailed plans were finalised in December 1994. The club intended to build a 60,000 seat stadium, to be completed in three phases. The first phase was the new North Stand, which was designed by Percy Johnson-Marshall Associates, engineered by Hutter Jennings Titchmarsh, and built by Miller Construction. Celtic Park reopened with a friendly against Newcastle on 5 August 1995, with the new 26,970-capacity North Stand and the existing 7,850-capacity Main (South) Stand in place. This was augmented by a temporary stand, holding 2,800 seats, on the site of the former West Terracing. Phase two of the redevelopment was completed in August 1996, with the opening of the 13,006-capacity East Stand. Phase 3a was completed in February 1998 with the opening of the South West Corner. This was followed by Phase 3b, the Jock Stein Stand on the former West Terracing site, which was opened in August 1998 with a match against Liverpool. This third phase added another 13,006 seats, bringing the total capacity of the new Celtic Park to . Phases 2 and 3 were built by Barr Construction. The whole redevelopment, which made Celtic Park the biggest club stadium in Britain, cost \u00a340 million. In the 1998\u201399 season the average attendance was 59,224 and season ticket sales exceeded 53,000, the highest number in Britain at the time."]}, {"page": "McDiarmid Park", "response": ["The stadium was designed by Percy Johnson-Marshall and built by Miller Construction.Official match programme: St Johnstone v. Manchester United, 17 October 1989 The stadium was a prototype and based on legislative advice that was soon to become out of date, but a good facility was built for a reasonable cost. Work started on the Tulloch farmland donated by Bruce McDiarmid in December 1988 and was finished in time for the start of the 1989\u201390 season. Although McDiarmid Park was opened after the Hillsborough disaster, all of the planning and most of the construction work had been done beforehand. Lord Justice Taylor visited the ground as part of his inquiry into the disaster."]}, {"page": "Waverley Route", "response": ["Barbara Castle's intention to discontinue passenger services on the Waverley Route was opposed by Willie Ross and Anthony Crosland, President of the Board of Trade, who considered that it would call into question the Government's intention to support the economic development of the Borders region and make a mockery of the consultative arrangements for the closure of railway lines by ignoring the findings of the TUCC and rejecting the recommendations of the Scottish Economic Planning Council. Castle was replaced by Richard Marsh in April 1968 after a Cabinet reshuffle. The new minister was unhappy to be moved from his previous position of Minister of Power to a ministry about which he \"knew nothing and cared less\". On 8 April 1968, two days after the reshuffle, the Ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning (MCEP) met to hear the arguments for and against closure of the line; Marsh referred to statistics which showed that passenger numbers between Edinburgh and Hawick had dipped by 30% between 1964 and 1967, while car ownership had risen by 120% and the local population had decreased by 9.5%. In reply, those on the side of retention argued that closure of the line at a time when government policy was to encourage industry to move to the Borders area would send the wrong message and asked the Minister not to reach a final decision until publication of a report by a group of University of Edinburgh consultants, James Wreford Watson, Percy Johnson-Marshall and James Nathan Wolfe, on the development of the Borders region. The report - The Central Borders: A Plan for Expansion - was delivered to Willie Ross on 19 April and, while concluding that the economic well-being of the region depended on good transport links with Edinburgh, it was nevertheless equivocal on the need for the Waverley Route and its recommendations concerned road transport rather than rail."]}, {"page": "List of British architects", "response": ["*Percy Johnson-Marshall (1915\u20131993)"]}, {"page": "Percy Edwin Alan Johnson-Marshall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Percy Johnson-Marshall"]}, {"page": "Stirrat Johnson-Marshall", "response": ["In 1937, he married Joan Mary Brighouse, whom he had met at the University of Liverpool.
