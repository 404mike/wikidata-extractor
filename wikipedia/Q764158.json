Rocastle then went on to feature in the Premier League for Leeds United, Manchester City and Chelsea, before later playing in the Football League for Norwich City and Hull City and finishing his career in Malaysia with Sabah FA. Rocastle also played for the England national team, in all earning 14 international caps for the Three Lions.Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who became Arsenal manager four years after Rocastle left the club, has described him as \"a modern player, because the revolution of the game has gone on to more technique, and more skill\" and as having an \"exceptional dimension as a footballer\". Rocastle is seen as a universally popular, iconic and legendary figure by many fans of the Gunners. The David Rocastle indoor centre at Arsenal's academy is named after him and his name is displayed at the Emirates Stadium.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 2", "response": ["*  1967   \u2013 David Rocastle, English footballer (d. 2001)"]}, {"page": "March 31", "response": ["*2001 \u2013 David Rocastle, English footballer (b. 1967)"]}, {"page": "Brockley", "response": ["* David Rocastle, professional footballer, playing midfield for Arsenal and England"]}, {"page": "Lewisham", "response": ["*David Rocastle (footballer) born and raised in Lewisham and Brockley.

While Arsenal lost the League Cup final the following year (a shock 3\u20132 defeat to Luton Town), they remained consistent in the league. Graham's side featured tight defensive discipline, embodied by his young captain Tony Adams, who along with Lee Dixon, Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn, would form the basis of the club's defence for over a decade. However, contrary to popular belief, during this time Arsenal were not a purely defensive side; Graham also built up an impressive midfield containing David Rocastle, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson, and striker Alan Smith, whose prolific goal-scoring regularly brought him more than 20 goals per season."]}, {"page": "Glenn Hoddle", "response": ["Chelsea reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' competition in 1994\u201395 and lost by a single goal to Real Zaragoza, who went on to beat Arsenal in the final.

First, he was seen to openly goad Brian McClair after the Manchester United striker had missed a late penalty in an FA Cup tie at Highbury. The second incident came in the League Cup final later that same season. Despite having fallen behind in the early stages, Arsenal, the holders, were leading Luton Town 2\u20131 at Wembley with less than quarter of an hour to go when David Rocastle got a penalty.

In all, he played 206 matches, scoring 30 goals. However, he fell out with Arsenal manager George Graham in the autumn of 1991. As a result, he was sold to the side he had helped defeat in 1989, Liverpool, with their manager Graeme Souness paying the Gunners \u00a31.5 million for Thomas's services on 16 December 1991.

With Arsenal needing to win by two goals, the game stood at 1\u20130 as the clock showed the 90 minutes were up. Dixon received a ball in his own half and looked to mount a final attack. Spotting the run of centre forward Alan Smith towards the right channel, Dixon delivered a long ball on to his chest. Smith's run had forced a Liverpool defender across with him and Arsenal midfielder Michael Thomas made a charge into the gap, took Smith's sideways pass in his stride and slipped the ball past Bruce Grobbelaar.

Horton initially told chairman Peter Swales that \"we have the makings, the backbone of a really good squad\" and that he was satisfied in not making many additions if it meant keeping hold of the existing squad; he cancelled a pre-arranged sale of Steve Lomas to Preston North End. City's previous three seasons in the top-flight had yielded top-ten finishes but Horton struggled with injuries \u2013 key striker Niall Quinn was missing through a cruciate ligament injury \u2013 and City were 20th and bottom in mid-February.
