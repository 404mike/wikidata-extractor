He wrote, \"Somehow, in a landscape dominated by Led Zeppelin at one end and the Osmonds at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock'n'roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos. And although their popularity has ebbed and flowed, their influence has been strikingly consistent.\" In 2019, The Economist also described them as \"the best British art-rock band since the Beatles\", arguing that \"among English rock acts of that time, their spirit of adventure and their impact\" was \"surpassed only\" by David Bowie. Bowie himself cited Roxy Music as one of his favourite British groups and in a 1975 television interview described Bryan Ferry as \"spearheading some of the best music to come out of England.\""]}, {"page": "A Day in the Life", "response": ["\"A Day in the Life\" became one of the Beatles' most influential songs, and many now consider it to be the band's greatest work. Paul Grushkin, in his book Rockin' Down the Highway: The Cars and People That Made Rock Roll, called the track \"one of the most ambitious, influential, and groundbreaking works in pop music history\". According to musicologist John Covach, A Day in the Life' is perhaps one of the most important single tracks in the history of rock music; clocking in at only four minutes and forty-five seconds, it must surely be among the shortest epic pieces in rock.\" In his review of the 50th anniversary edition of Sgt. Pepper for Rolling Stone, Mikal Gilmore says that \"A Day in the Life\" and Harrison's \"Within You Without You\" are the only songs on the album that transcend its legacy as \"a gestalt: a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts\". In a 2017 article for Newsweek, Tim de Lisle cited Chris Smith's recollection of him and fellow art student Freddie Mercury \"writ[ing] little bits of songs which we linked together, like 'A Day in the Life, as evidence to show that \"No Pepper, no 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.\""]}, {"page": "A Whiter Shade of Pale", "response": ["Keith Reid got the title and starting point for the song at a party. He overheard someone at the party saying to a woman, \"You've turned a whiter shade of pale\", and the phrase stuck in his mind. The original lyrics had four verses, of which only two are heard on the original recording. The third verse has been heard in live performances by Procol Harum, and more seldom the fourth. Claes Johansen, in his book Procol Harum: Beyond the Pale, suggests that the song \"deals in metaphorical form with a male/female relationship which after some negotiation ends in a sexual act\". This is supported by Tim de Lisle in Lives of the Great Songs, who remarks that the lyrics concern a drunken seduction, which is described through references to sex as a form of travel, usually nautical, using mythical and literary journeys.Lives of the Great Songs, Tim de Lisle, Trafalgar Square, 1995, .

Cricket writer Tim de Lisle praised the pair, saying that \"Together they were responsible for a shining moment in the game's history ... Two strips of black tape, more potent than any logo, breathed life back into the game's battered spirit.\" England captain Nasser Hussain said that Flower and Olonga \"have proved to be great men by what they have done.\" As a result of the protest, Olonga's girlfriend broke up with him, and he received numerous threatening emails and death threats."]}, {"page": "Katherine Rundell", "response": ["Katherine was born in Kent, England in 1987 and spent ten years in Harare, Zimbabwe, where her father was a diplomat.
