Also here at Google Books. This gesture was done in honour of the visiting Roman emperor and his identification with Zeus Olympias, reflected in Hadrian's efforts in building temples dedicated to the supreme Olympian god. Following the revolt in 132\u2013135, many Jewish refugees from devastated Judea settled there, turning it into a center of Jewish religious and spiritual life. Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi, the compiler of the Mishnah, a commentary on the Torah, moved to Sepphoris, along with the Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish religious court. Before moving to Tiberias by 150, some Jewish academies of learning, yeshivot, were also based there. The Galilee was predominantly populated by Jews from the end of the 2nd century to the 4th century CE.Mordecai Avian, 'Distribution Maps of Archaeological data from the Galilee, in J\u00fcrgen Zangenberg, Harold W. Attridge, Dale B. Martin,(eds.) Religion, Ethnicity, and Identity in Ancient Galilee Mohr Siebeck 2007 pp. 115\u2013132, p. 132. As late as the third-fourth centuries, Sepphoris is believed to have been settled by one of the twenty-four priestly courses, Jedayah by name, a course mentioned in relation to the town itself in both the Jerusalem Talmud (Taanit 4:5) and in the Caesarea Inscription. (Hebrew) Others, however, cast doubt about Sepphoris ever being under a \"priestly oligarchy\" by the third century, and that it may simply reflect a misreading of Talmudic sources.Stuart S.

Consequently, documents from the 15th and 16th century refer to Bellapais as the \"White Abbey\". The common explanation of the modern name Bellapais is that the French name  (\"Abbey of Peace\") was corrupted after the Italian takeover into \"Bellapais\", reinterpreted as  \"Beautiful Land\". George Francis Hill was unconvinced of both the French and Italian portions of this derivation."]}, {"page": "1933 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* George Francis Hill, , Director and Principal Librarian of the British Museum."]}]}}
