Thomas studied at University College London, largely as a research apprentice to Ethel Sargant, receiving her BSc in 1905. She joined Bedford College and soon became head of the newly formed botany department. Thomas left the Bedford College in 1913, subsequently holding roles at University of South Wales, National Museum of Wales and in the Women's Land Army, before settling at University College, Leicester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ethel Sargant", "response": ["Sargant spent some years doing botanical work at home while she cared for her mother and sister. To combine her caring responsibilities and academic pursuits, she ran a small laboratory in the grounds of her mother's house in Reigate, which she called \"Jodrell Junior\" . She employed Ethel Thomas (1897-1901) and Agnes Arber (1902-3) as research assistants. For the following years she specialised in seedling anatomy, giving a course of lectures on botany at the University of London in 1907."]}, {"page": "List of women botanists", "response": ["| Ethel Thomas"]}, {"page": "Women's Land Army (World War I)", "response": ["The Women's Land Army (WLA) was a British civilian organisation. It was created in 1917 by the Board of Agriculture during World War I to encourage women to work in agriculture, replacing men called up to the military. Women who worked for the WLA were commonly known as Land Girls. In effect the Land Army operated to place women with farms that needed workers, the farmers being their employers. They picked crops and did all the jobs that the men would do. Notable members included the archaeologist Lily Chitty and the botanist Ethel Thomas. It was disbanded in 1919 but revived in June 1939 under the same name."]}, {"page": "Ethel Nancy Miles Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ethel Thomas"]}]}}
