However, at the 1922 general election, the Liberal took the seat on a swing of over 10%.\nAt the 1923 election, he stood in Torquay, where he lost narrowly to the Liberal candidate. He won the seat at the 1924 general election, and represented Torquay in Parliament until his death at the aged of 69, a few months after being returned for the ninth time at the 1955 election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1936\u20131952)", "response": ["*Charles Williams (1886\u20131955)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "Truro (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "Chairman of Ways and Means", "response": ["| Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Williams"]}, {"page": "Frederic Bennett", "response": ["In October 1955, the MP for Torquay, Charles Williams, died after more than thirty years as the town's MP.
