He was Member of Parliament (MP) for constituencies in Devon from 1918 to 1922, and from 1924 to 1955.\nHe was elected to the House of Commons on his first attempt, as a Coalition Conservative candidate for the Tavistock constituency at the 1918 general election, defeating his Liberal Party opponent with a majority of 13% of the votes. However, at the 1922 general election, the Liberal took the seat on a swing of over 10%.\nAt the 1923 election, he stood in Torquay, where he lost narrowly to the Liberal candidate. He won the seat at the 1924 general election, and represented Torquay in Parliament until his death at the aged of 69, a few months after being returned for the ninth time at the 1955 election.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
