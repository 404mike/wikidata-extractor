Fashioned in the style of Richard Lester's A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help! (1965), it is a showcase for the talents of the period, including Kiri te Kanawa (\"Sing for us now, Kiri\"). The songs are mostly written by Patrick Flynn in collaboration with either O'Shea or Musaphia. However, the film is also a knockabout romantic comedy: the dialogue non-sequiturs, pratfall gags and bizarre juxtapositions display an offbeat sense of irony and blase manner not unlike that of television in the late Eighties (Terry and the Gunrunners and The Billy T. James Show, for example). As a nostalgia piece, the film comes as close to capturing the hopes and aspirations of the period as the Weekly Reviews do for the Forties and the Tangata Whenua series does for the Seventies."]}, {"page": "Grant Tilly", "response": ["Aside from a busy stage career, Tilly acted often for the screen. He made his television debut in the 1967 one-off comedy The Tired Man then ad-libbed alongside playwright Joseph Musaphia on the children's show Joe's World. Tilly's biggest screen roles include that of a headmaster who has an affair in 1979's film adaptation of Middle Age Spread (showbusiness magazine Variety compared him to \"an antipodean Woody Allen\"Mike Nicolaidi, 'Middle Age Spread'(Review), Variety, 31 December 1978) and in the 1982 comedy Carry Me Back, as the farmer who must sneak his father's body back home after he unexpectedly dies. Grant Tilly's is the voice in the Oscar-nominated animated Western short The Frog, The Dog, And The Devil."]}, {"page": "Mussafia", "response": ["*Joseph Musaphia (born 1935),  a New Zealand writer and actor"]}, {"page": "Musaphia, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Musaphia"]}, {"page": "Centrepoint Theatre", "response": ["In the first season, only one of the productions was a New Zealand play.
