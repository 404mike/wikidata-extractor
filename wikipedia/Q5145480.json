He was Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for West Lancashire. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1992, and retired at the general election of 2005.\nPickthall's father was a shipyard fitter. He attended Ulverston Grammar School, and then the University of Wales, obtaining a B.A. Hons. English Literature and History. He then went on to the University of Lancaster, where he obtained an M.A. with the thesis \"The Influence of Socialism on 20th Century British Poetry\". He became a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the Labour Party, in 1963.\nHe married a Canadian, Judith Ann, in 1973; they have two daughters, Alisoun and Jenny. He initially worked as a lecturer of English, in the Ruffwood Comprehensive School and Edge Hill College of H.E. (where he became the Head of European Studies).\nAt the general election of June 1987, Pickthall ran for Parliament in West Lancashire, but lost to the Conservatives by 1,353 votes. Later, in 1989, he won the seat of Ormskirk on Lancashire County Council by a very small margin. However, this was sufficient for the Labour Party to take control of the County Council by one seat. \nAt the general election of April 1992, he took the parliamentary seat of West Lancashire, and in the following elections, in May 1997 and June 2001, he retained the seat, with a substantial majority. He became a member of the Select committee on Agriculture in 1992, the post that he maintained until 1997. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Alun Michael MP, in 1997, later serving Jack Straw MP. \nHe resigned as PPS in December 2000, in response to the police investigation, into his election expenses. He was later reinstated shortly afterwards, in 2001, when the police investigation concluded there had been \u201cno wrongdoing\u201d. He was transferred to the Foreign Office in 2001, where he continued as Straw's PPS.\nHe pledged his \"continuing support\" for Tony Blair in July 2004, remarking that his performance has been \"psychologically remarkable\".Pickthall is considered a leftist, frequently campaigning on animal welfare and environmental issues. He is opposed to hare coursing, as the Waterloo Cup took place at Great Altcar, in his constituency, and hunting. His support for the hunting ban led to pro-hunt supporters leaving a dead fox on his doorstep in February 2005. He retired from the House of Commons, at the general election of May 2005.Pickthall is a supporter of Humanists UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Colin Pickthall", "| Colin Pickthall"]}, {"page": "1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Colin Pickthall"]}, {"page": "Lancaster University", "response": ["* Colin Pickthall, Creative Writing (1967, Lonsdale) \u2013 Former MP for Lancashire West"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Colin Pickthall"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Colin Pickthall"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| West Lancashire || Rosie Cooper || Labour || Colin Pickthall || Labour"]}, {"page": "West Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The seat's first member, Ken Hind, held the seat for two terms as a Conservative, winning the first election in the landslide Conservative result of 1983.
