Paton, together with Margaret Ballinger, Edgar Brookes, and Leo Marquard, formed the Liberal Association in early-1953. On 9 May 1953, it became the Liberal Party of South Africa, with Paton as a founding co-vice-president, which fought against the apartheid laws introduced by the National Party government. He served as President of the LPSA until its forced dissolution by the government in the late-1960s; officially because its membership comprised both Blacks and Whites. Paton was a friend of Bernard Friedman, founder of the Progressive Party. Paton's writer colleague Laurens van der Post, who had moved to England in the 1930s, helped the party in many ways. Van der Post knew that the South African Secret Police were aware that he was paying money to Paton, but could not stop it by legal procedures. Paton himself adopted a peaceful opposition in protests against apartheid, as did many others in the party; some SALP members took a more violent route, and consequently some stigma did attach to the party. Paton's passport was confiscated upon his return from New York in 1960, where he had been presented with the annual Freedom Award. It was not returned to him for ten years."]}, {"page": "Liberal Party of South Africa", "response": ["*Margaret Ballinger (South African MP) \u2013 President of party"]}, {"page": "Rhodes University", "response": ["* Margaret Ballinger \u2013 Political activist; taught in the history department"]}, {"page": "List of the first women holders of political offices in Africa", "response": ["*Leader of a political party (President of the Liberal Party of South Africa) \u2013 Margaret Ballinger \u2013 1953Margaret Ballinger pre-school, asha.org.za, accessed March 2010"]}, {"page": "Ballinger (surname)", "response": ["*Margaret Ballinger (1894\u20131980) was the first President of the Liberal Party of South Africa"]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Margaret Ballinger, first President of the Liberal Party of South Africa", "*Margaret Ballinger (1894\u20131980), South African politician, first President of the Liberal Party of South Africa, \"Queen of the Blacks\"; held considerable power in the government of South Africa"]}]}}
