The discovery of these objects aroused much discussion about possible connections between ancient Mesopotamia and China, although their authenticity was doubted by many scholars from the beginning and they are now generally regarded as forgeries.", "The history of the putative artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown a photo of a rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article."]}, {"page": "Inara (goddess)", "response": ["Inara built a house on a cliff and gave it to Hupasiyas.

But if the Milawata letter postdates this letter, and if that letter is taken as a letter of Mursili II (1322\u20131295 BC), then the Tawagalawa letter might belong to Mursili in the late 14th century BC, but after the end of his annals."]}, {"page": "Samuha", "response": ["Scholars are divided on the location of Samuha.Gurney O.R. The Upper Land, matum elitum // Hittite Studies in Honor of Harry A. Hoffner Jr. On the Occasion of His 65th Birthday. Eds. Gregory McMahon and Gary M. Beckman. Winona Lake, 2003. P. 123-125 Some maintain it was on the banks of the Euphrates river. Others believe it was located on the Halys river, presently called the K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River. The K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River is closer to Hattusa. Its headwaters are near the city of Sivas, 130 miles (209\u00a0km) away. The river flows to the east, south of Hattusa, then heads northward on the east of Hattusa, discharging into the Black Sea. The Euphrates location is reflected in the GPS coordinates above. Hittite records indicate that Samuha was located on a navigable river, which tends to support the Euphrates location. Oliver Gurney notes in the above-cited work that the Halys river is also navigable in sections. He favors the Euphrates location, noting that the Murad Su, the present day Murat River had river traffic in 1866. The Murat river is a tributary of the Euphrates river. Both proposed locations are south of the Kaskian incursion that overtook Hattusa and required the Hittite leadership to move to Samuha."]}, {"page": "Gurney (surname)", "response": ["*Oliver Gurney (1911\u20132001), English assyriologist and hittitologist"]}, {"page": "Jeremy Black (assyriologist)", "response": ["After his attendance at Slough Grammar School for Boys, in 1969 Black went to Worcester College, Oxford, as Exhibitioner in Classics.
