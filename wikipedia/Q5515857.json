Tried on a charge of manslaughter, Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by benefit of clergy, a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse (the neck-verse), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded on his left thumb.

Jane Milling. Vol. 1. UK: Cambridge University, 2004; pp. 70\u201392.  In 1597 Pembroke's Men staged the infamous play The Isle of Dogs, by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson, the content of which gave offence, most likely for its \"satirical\" nature on the attack of some people high in authority. Jonson was imprisoned, along with Gabriel Spenser, an actor in the play, and Robert Shaa. Langley, already in trouble with the Privy Council over matters unrelated to theatre, may have exacerbated his danger by allowing his company to stage the play after a royal order that all playing stop and all theatres be demolished. This order of the Privy Council called for all London Theatres to be \"plucked down\", but may have arisen because of  Langley and the 'seditious, lewd play'.  The other companies were under inhibition to stop playing. The Lord Chamberlain's Men went on tour to six areas of the south east and south west, and the Admiral's Men did not perform again at The Rose until the inhibition was lifted at the end of October. Johnson was released from jail on October 3rd. Nashe however went on the run. All but the Swan Theatre were granted licenses to perform.  The Swan continued to operate without a license until 19 February 1598, when the two licensed companies called attention to them. Following the scandal, the Swan only held sporadic performances. Another scandal rocked the Swan in 1602, when Richard Vennar advertised a new play, England's Joy, to be performed at the Swan on 6 November. Vennar claimed the play was a fantastical story in honour of Queen Elizabeth, and seats sold out quickly.  However, the play was never performed.  The townspeople were enraged and vandalised the theatre, and the theatre never seemed to recover its former popularity."]}, {"page": "List of people killed in duels", "response": ["*Gabriel Spenser, Elizabethan actor, by Ben Jonson on Hoxton Fields, London 1598"]}, {"page": "The Isle of Dogs (play)", "response": ["Whatever the cause, Richard Topcliffe informed Robert Cecil, who raised the issue to the Privy Council on July 28.

It is usually assumed that Aubrey mixed up the two killings.Harry Guest, The Artist on the Artist, Intellect Books, 2000, p. 95. Gabriel Spenser is briefly mentioned in the novel at the very beginning, as an actor who played the title role in Marlowe's play Edward II. His performance is mentioned again at the end in the dialogue between Jonson and Nashe, but it is never implied that Marlowe has adopted his identity in 1598. Richard Bame is based on Richard Baines, the informer who denounced Marlowe. The claim that he was executed for a crime he may not have committed is derived from surviving evidence concerning the execution of a man of that name."]}, {"page": "Gabriel Spencer", "response": ["#REDIRECTGabriel Spenser"]}, {"page": "Timeline of London", "response": ["** 22 September: Playwright Ben Jonson kills actor Gabriel Spenser in a duel at Hoxton and is briefly held in Newgate Prison but escapes capital punishment by pleading benefit of clergy."]}, {"page": "Imaginary Lives", "response": ["|\"Gabriel Spenser, Acteur\" || \"Gabriel Spenser, Actor\" || Gabriel Spenser"]}, {"page": "Horrible Histories (2015 TV series)", "response": ["| Gabriel Spenser (2016 Specials), Robert Hooke (2016 Specials), John Shakespeare (2016 Specials)"]}]}}
