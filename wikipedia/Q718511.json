Experimentalists used a variety of terms for the study of the origin of life from nonliving materials. Heterogenesis was applied to the generation of living things from once-living organic matter (such as boiled broths), and Henry Charlton Bastian proposed the term archebiosis for life originating from inorganic materials. Disliking the randomness and unpredictability implied by the term \"'spontaneous' generation,\" in 1870 Bastian coined the term biogenesis to refer to the formation of life from nonliving matter. Soon thereafter, however, English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley proposed the term abiogenesis to refer to this same process and adopted biogenesis for the process by which life arises from existing life; it is this latter set of definitions that became dominant."]}, {"page": "1880 in literature", "response": ["*Henry Charlton Bastian \u2013 The Brain as an Organ of Mind"]}, {"page": "Biogenesis", "response": ["The term biogenesis was coined by Henry Charlton Bastian to mean the generation of a life form from nonliving materials; however, Thomas Henry Huxley chose the term abiogenesis and redefined biogenesis for life arising from preexisting life.

Later, in 1880, Henry Charlton Bastian suggested \"kinaesthesia\" instead of \"muscle sense\" on the basis that some of the afferent information (back to the brain) comes from other structures, including tendons, joints, and skin.
