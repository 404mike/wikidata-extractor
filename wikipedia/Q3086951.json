Swansea had only lost once in over two seasons (to Cardiff) and were the champion club team of Great Britain. Wallace said of the match \"This was the thirty-second match of the tour and our hearts rejoiced at the thought that this was to be the last.\" The first half was mainly spent in All Blacks territory as they struggled to gain ground kicking into a strong wind and, after 25 minutes, Swansea scored a try through Fred Scrine that was unconverted. The half finished 3\u20130 to Swansea. The All Blacks playing with the wind to their backs nearly scored a try to McGregor but he was ruled to have stepped out. However, soon after, Wallace gained possession and ran towards Swansea's 25-yard line before kicking a drop-goal in the strong wind to give the All Blacks a 4\u20133 lead. The All Blacks then kept forcing Swansea back with kick after kick for the next 15 minutes to win the match 4\u20133."]}, {"page": "Aberdare RFC", "response": ["The resulting investigation from the WRU, at the time still called the Welsh Football Union, spread far further than the two clubs mentioned by Rees. The union saw 6 players temporarily suspended, including Welsh international Fred Scrine, Merthyr escaped with a warning but Treorchy and Aberdare saw the permanent suspension of their entire committees. The union also permanently suspended eight players, including Jones who switched to rugby league. The events of the investigation led to bad feeling in the rugby community of Aberdare, and was a major factor in Aberdare founding Aberdare RLFC, one of the first professional rugby league clubs and member of the Welsh League. This combination of the change to Northern League and the resultant 1908 team photo, which featured several players wearing 'snake belts' to hold up their shorts, gave rise to the nickname of \"The Snakes\"."]}, {"page": "1899 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea) capt., Viv Huzzey (Cardiff), Gwyn Nicholls (Cardiff), Reg Skrimshire (Newport), Llewellyn (Llwynypia), Evan James (Swansea), David James (Swansea), Jere Blake (Cardiff), Tom Dobson (Cardiff), William Alexander (Llwynypia), Fred Scrine (Swansea), David Daniel (Llanelli), Alfred Brice (Aberavon), Jehoida Hodges (Newport), Will Parker (Swansea)", "Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea) capt., Viv Huzzey (Cardiff), Gwyn Nicholls (Cardiff), Reg Skrimshire (Newport), Llewellyn (Llwynypia), Selwyn Biggs (Cardiff), Llewellyn Lloyd (Newport), Jere Blake (Cardiff), Tom Dobson (Cardiff), William Alexander (Llwynypia), Fred Scrine (Swansea), Alfred Brice (Aberavon), Jehoida Hodges (Newport), Will Parker (Swansea), Dick Hellings (Llwynypia) "]}, {"page": "1901 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea) capt., Llewellyn (Llwynypia), Gwyn Nicholls (Cardiff), George Davies (Swansea), Rhys Gabe (Llanelli), Dicky Owen (Swansea), Dick Jones (Swansea), Hopkin Davies (Swansea), Jere Blake (Cardiff), William Alexander (Llwynypia), Fred Miller (Mountain Ash), Alfred Brice (Aberavon), Bob Jones (Llwynypia), George Boots (Newport), Fred Scrine (Swansea)"]}, {"page": "Scrine", "response": ["*Fred Scrine (1877\u20131962), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "David Daniel (rugby union)", "response": ["Daniel's final season with Wales was during the 1899 Home Nations Championship.

The last of their encounters in Wales was against Swansea, and except for a narrow defeat in a classic encounter against the National team, had defeated all their opponents, including England, Ireland and Scotland. Swansea was the last match to be played on British soil but few critics gave Swansea any hope of beating the All Blacks.Billot (1980), pg 42. Gordon lead his team in a narrow loss against New Zealand, the All Blacks scoring a dropped goal, while Swansea scored a single try from Fred Scrine. In 1905 that left the score 4\u20133 to New Zealand, by modern standards it would have seen Swansea win 5\u20133."]}, {"page": "Dickie David", "response": ["In 1906, David faced his second touring side with Cardiff; Paul Roos' South Africans. Cardiff beat the tourists 17-0, the largest defeat for the South Africans that tour. The same season, David won his first and only Welsh cap, when he was chosen to face Ireland as part of the 1907 Home Nations Championship. The game began in controversy after the Welsh captain, Billy Trew, withdrew in protest to the treatment of suspended teammate Fred Scrine, by the Welsh Rugby Union. This left a space open at centre, which was taken by Bush, and to ensure club continuity David was brought in as his partner. The game ended in a record win over the Irish for Wales, but despite this the next season David was replaced by Newport's Tommy Vile."]}, {"page": "Welsh League", "response": ["The WRU held an investigation into all the allegations, and the sub-committees final report, published in September 1907 asserted that the allegations of professionalism being \"rampant in Welsh clubs\" were not proven, although they did find evidence of certain clubs giving additional payments to their players. The Union's reaction was incisive but unbalanced. Temporary suspensions were given to six players, including Swansea's Fred Scrine, the permanent suspension of the entire Aberdare and Treorchy committees, and the permanent suspension of eight player from the sport of rugby union, including Dai Jones. Although Merthyr Alexandria were let off with just a warning. The reason for the leniency shown to Merthyr is thought to have been connected to the club's apparent move to the professional Northern code. Merthyr Alexandria, had proposed in their AGM of 1907 to turn away from amateurism and join the Northern Union. Although the motion was heavily defeated, the week after the AGM it was reported that fixtures had been arranged, players signed and guarantors found for a new 'professional rugby club' in the town. In July 1907 a new Merthyr Tydfil league team joined the Northern Rugby Union. It was therefore believed the WRU did not suspend or punish Merthyr Alexandria to prevent the squad converting to the newly formed league team. Just prior to the formation of Merthyr Tydfil RLFC, Ebbw Vale RFC had decided to switch from the union game and joined the Northern Union because the members were enraged at the \"...bogus amateurism in the Monmouthshire League\".Lush (1998), pg. 24 Both these clubs formed the first professional challenge from Wales in the Northern League finishing 23rd (Merthyr)Lush (1998), pg. 20 and 26th (Ebbw Vale)Lush (1998), pg. 25 out of 27 teams in their first season."]}]}}
