In the same year he was awarded a place at Ruskin College, Oxford. He also joined the Independent Labour Party and was elected to its National Council.\nIn the First World War he became active in the Union of Democratic Control, and was arrested for making a speech appealing for immediate peace negotiations.  In 1916 he was offered the chance of exemption from military service on trade and health grounds, but preferred to take his stand as a conscientious objector.  Refused exemption in that category, he was forcibly enlisted, and sentenced to two years imprisonment for disobeying an order; he then accepted the Home Office Scheme, and was transferred to Princetown Work Centre in the erstwhile Dartmoor Prison.\nFred Longden was elected Member of Parliament for Birmingham Deritend, 1929-1931 and 1945\u20131950, and then in 1950 for Birmingham Small Heath, which he retained until his death in 1952 aged 58.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HM Prison Dartmoor", "response": ["*Fred Longden"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Fred Longden"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Fred Longden"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Fred Longden"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Fred Longden"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Fred Longden"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Co-operative MPs", "response": ["| 1929 || Fred Longden|| Birmingham Deritend"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Small Heath (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1950 || Fred Longden || Labour || Died October 1952"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Deritend (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Fred Longden", "| Fred Longden"]}, {"page": "William Wheeldon", "response": ["Following the death of Fred Longden, Wheeldon was elected as Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Small Heath in a by-election in 1952.
