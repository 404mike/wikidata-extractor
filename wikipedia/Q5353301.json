Kareena had taken a hiatus from the serial and returned two months later with what was billed as a \"sexy new vamp look\" \u2014 part of the producers attempt to popularise the much-criticised Ferreira family. Despite most of the male characters showing an interest in the new-look Kareena, she opted for Mickey. Swash said, \"[Mickey]'s always liked [Kareena]. His eyes nearly pop out of his head when she returns! I think they'd make a good couple because they're chalk and cheese.\" The relationship hit various setbacks. When Mickey discovered Kareena had taken cocaine, he contemplated finishing with her, leaving Kareena to be comforted by Mickey's business partner and Kareena's drug dealer, Juley Smith (Joseph Kpobie). Despite weathering these problems, it was a brief reprieve as the relationship ended the episode following their reconciliation in March 2005, when Kareena left the serial with her family. In reality, the entire Ferreira family had been axed by executive producer, Kathleen Hutchison. Despite promising to stay for Mickey's sake, Kareena changed her mind at the last minute and left. Mickey's next relationship was with \"bad girl\" Li Chong (Elaine Tan) in 2007, a fellow wheeler-dealer. The characters' storylines mainly concentrated on money-making schemes, including Li's cannabis farm, and her attempt to \"pimp\" Mickey as a male escort; however, the relationship ended when Mickey started getting too serious, and Li left the serial in July 2007 when the character was written out."]}, {"page": "List of former EastEnders characters", "response": ["|Li Chong || Elaine Tan || 2006\u20132007"]}, {"page": "Starter for 10 (film)", "response": ["* Elaine Tan as Lucy Chang"]}, {"page": "Ivan Shaw", "response": ["Shaw has also appeared in feature films such as Get Him to the Greek (as a Pinnacle Executive), L!fe Happens (as Ivan #2), The Truth About Angels (as JC), and Rush Hour 2 (as a Triad Gangster).
