Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt for the first time in its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, hiring him as the club's chairman."]}, {"page": "Dundee F.C.", "response": ["In 2008, after a poor run in the league, manager Alex Rae was sacked, with former manager Jocky Scott taking over for his third stint with the club.", "* Jocky Scott (1971)", "* Jocky Scott (2009)", "|rowspan=\"3\"| Jocky Scott || 1986\u20131988"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Jocky Scott"]}, {"page": "Arbroath F.C.", "response": ["* Jocky Scott (1994)"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 in English football", "response": ["* 10 October - Coach Gary Brazil takes over at Notts County, replacing Jocky Scott (sacked 10 October)"]}, {"page": "Stirling Albion F.C.", "response": ["A poor start to season 2010\u201311 saw John O'Neill and assistant Roddy Grant under pressure.
