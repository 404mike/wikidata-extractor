On 14 May Kenny Hibbitt's goal from his rehearsed free kick routine with Willie Carr gave Wolves a 1\u20130 win at Bolton. Bolton's defeat reached the Forest team mid-air en route to an end of season break in Mallorca.

The fighting spilled onto the pitch and forced a 17-minute delay in the match, after which Ipswich continued to dominate but could not extend their lead.  Early in the second half, a goal-line clearance from Millwall's Jon Moore fell to Mariner who finished it to double Ipswich's lead.  Mariner scored again with fifteen minutes to go, tapping in from a Turner cross.  Dave Mehmet pulled one back for Millwall after a Barry Kitchener effort was saved by Cooper, but Ipswich then scored three times in as many minutes.  Wark, Talbot and Mariner (completing his hat-trick) added to the scoreline which ended 6\u20131 and Ipswich progressed.  The semi-final, against West Bromwich Albion, was played at Arsenal's Highbury as a neutral venue.  The opening goal came from a diving header: Talbot displayed \"outrageous bravery\" to score at the near post from a Mills cross.  Injured in doing so, Talbot was forced to withdraw from the match and sustained three stitches and concussion.  Ipswich extended their lead in the 21st minute after Cyrille Regis failed to clear a Mick Lambert corner which was turned in by Mills.  Hunter gave away a penalty with less than thirteen minutes to go which was duly converted by Tony Brown but Wark restored the two-goal lead with a late header from a Woods corner.  The match ended 3\u20131 and Ipswich had qualified for their first ever FA Cup final and first visit to Wembley Stadium."]}, {"page": "Maggie Holland", "response": ["In 1987, Holland began to write her first songs, encouraged by Jon Moore, one of her colleagues from Tiger Moth, with whom she had made an EP.
