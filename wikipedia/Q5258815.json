The 25-year-old Gillingham captain suffered a broken arm after taking a kick on the forearm in a 1\u20131 draw with Leyton Orient on 23 February 2010. A specialist subsequently confirmed that this injury would sideline him for approximately six weeks. By the time of his return the Gills were embroiled in a battle to avoid relegation and their fortunes took a turn for the worse when Fuller suffered a broken nose mere seconds after kick-off after a clash of heads with teammate Darren Dennehy in what would go on to be a 3\u20132 win over Leeds United on 17 April 2010; he was substituted by Jack Payne in the fourth minute of play. Fuller was unable to prevent the Gills' relegation slide back into League Two after he was sidelined for the rest of the season, undergoing surgery on his broken nose a few days after the incident. In spite of this, however, he was offered a two-year contract extension, along with teammate Garry Richards, by new Gills manager Andy Hessenthaler on 25 March 2010. He accepted the terms and on 4 June 2010 it was announced that he had signed a new contract along with striker Dennis Oli."]}, {"page": "Terrell Forbes", "response": ["Forbes moved onto Farnborough alongside Dennis Oli on 4 March 2016, before joining Grays Athletic the following season on 19 October."]}, {"page": "Howard Webb", "response": ["In May 2006, Webb took charge of the FA Trophy final at Upton Park in London.
