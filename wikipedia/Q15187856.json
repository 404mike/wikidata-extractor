Despite Kennedy's slight surge, the first 400-metre split was sluggish at 1:07.02.  Kenya's Yobes Ondieki passed Kennedy on the second home straight, and accelerated the pace radically.  Quickly Morocco's Khalid Skah and Brahim Boutayeb, Ethiopia's Fita Bayisa, Germany's Dieter Baumann, and Portugal's Domingos Castro positioned themselves behind the surging Kenyan runner.  To demonstrate the categorical reverse of the early pedestrian pace, Ondieki clocked 2:06.90 at 800 metres.  In other words, the final's second lap had been sprinted in 59.88 seconds!  Ondieki kept his speed throttle up through 1,000 metres in 2:36.83.  His surge caused the United States' Doug Padilla to lose contact with the other runners already before 1,200 metres.  Two laps later, Ondieki was about three seconds ahead of Boutayeb and Bayisa, with an unofficial split of 5:09.48 at 2,000 metres.  Baumann and Domingos Castro formed the second chasing pair, after Skah had dropped from their pace.  Further behind, Dionisio Castro of Portugal (Domingos's twin brother) and Britain's Gary Staines were fighting for seventh place.  Despite slowing down slightly in the third kilometre, Ondieki widened his lead as he speeded past 3,000 metres in 7:46.08.  During the fourth kilometre, the Kenyan's brutal early pace started to take its toll on his legs, but neither Bayisa nor Boutayeb was able to appreciably close in on him.  By contrast, Finland's Risto Ulmala broke away from the rear group, and caught Skah and Dionisio Castro.  Slightly behind this trio ran Britain's Rob Denmark, who also passed his badly exhausted team mate Staines.  Before 3,800 metres, Bayisa speeded away from Boutayeb.  At 4,000 metres, the gradually tiring Ondieki led in 10:29.07.  After 4,250 metres, the Kenyan lapped Padilla.  Ondieki's unofficial time at 4,600 metres was 12:09.07.  At the start of the last lap, Bayisa was still over six seconds behind the Kenyan.  By 4,800 metres (Ondieki's split was 12:41.90), the Ethiopian had only been able to narrow the gap to about five seconds.  Although he sprinted the home straight visibly faster than the fading Ondieki, Bayisa still lost to the Kenyan World Champion by over two seconds.  Boutayeb held on to the bronze medal, while Baumann sprinted narrowly past Domingos Castro, and Skah pulled away from Ulmala and Dionisio Castro.

Portugal's Domingos Castro first led the race, but soon thereafter France's Cyrille Laventure took the lead.  Laventure was still leading the race at 3,000 metres in 8:09.15, and at 4,000 metres in 10:53.34.  Despite the moderate pace, almost all runners were still in the lead group at this point.  On the second last back straight, Castro accelerated past Laventure into the lead, and the main group's runners started to string out.  Castro was still leading the race at 4,600 metres, in an informal time of 12:26.2 or 12:26.3.  Antibo, Britain's Gary Staines, Poland's Slawomir Majusiak, Laventure, and Finland's Risto Ulmala were chasing Castro.  On the final back straight, Staines tried to sprint past Antibo, who accelerated into the lead, leaving Castro behind.  At the start of the final bend, Staines sprinted past Antibo.  In the second half of the bend, however, Antibo furiously kicked past Staines.  Some metres behind the leading duo, Majusiak accelerated past the fading Castro.  Several metres behind the second pair of runners, Sweden's Jonny Danielsson passed Ulmala.  Despite celebrating his victory in the final metres, Antibo defeated Staines by almost half a second, while Majusiak secured the bronze medal.  Danielsson ran the home straight several metres faster than the exhausted Castro, but he still lost to the tiny Portuguese runner by under 0.2 seconds.
