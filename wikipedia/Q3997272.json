He is a novelist in English, a poet in Scottish Gaelic, the translator into English of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Rainer Maria Rilke, and an innovative and controversial critic of Scottish and international literature. His work in Gaelic appears under the name Cr\u00ecsdean MacIlleBh\u00e0in.\nWhyte first published some translations of modern poetry into Gaelic, including poems by Konstantinos Kavafis, Yannis Ritsos and Anna Akhmatova. He then published two collections of original poetry in Gaelic, Uirsgeul (Myth), 1991 and An Tr\u00e0th Duilich (The Difficult Time), 2002. In the meantime he started to write prose in English and has published four novels, Euphemia MacFarrigle and the Laughing Virgin (1995), The Warlock of Strathearn (1997), The Gay Decameron (1998) and The Cloud Machinery (2000).\nIn 2002, Whyte won a Scottish Research Book of the Year award for his edition of Sorley Maclean's D\u00e0in do Eimhir (Poems to Eimhir), published by the Association for Scottish Literary Studies. He has also compiled some anthologies of present-day Gaelic poetry and written critical articles and essays.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marina Tsvetaeva", "response": ["*Moscow in the Plague Year, translated by Christopher Whyte (180 poems written between November 1918 and May 1920) (Archipelago Press, New York, 2014), 268pp, ", "*Milestones (1922), translated by Christopher Whyte (Bristol, Shearsman Books, 2015), 122p, ", "*After Russia: The First Notebook, translated by Christopher Whyte (Bristol, Shearsman Books, 2017), 141 pp,  1 84861 549 6", "*After Russia: The Second Notebook, translated by Christopher Whyte (Bristol, Shearsman Books, 2018) 121 pp,  1 84861 551 9"]}, {"page": "Sorley MacLean", "response": ["In contrast, the English translations were all written in a very straightforward style, flattening the language by the necessity to choose one English word for the ambiguity and connotations of the Gaelic one. According to Christopher Whyte, the English translations produce \"an official interpretation, one that restricts and deadens the range of possible readings of the poem\". English could not convey the pop that MacLean's revival of disused words brought to his Gaelic poetry. While the Gaelic poems were noted for their acoustic properties, the translations did not pay any particular attention to sound, instead focusing narrowly on literal meaning. MacLean emphasized that his \"line-by-line translations\" were not poetry; of the prose translation of An Cuilthionn that appeared in D\u00e0in do Eimhir, he wrote, \"my English version has not even the merit of very strict literal accuracy as I find more and more when I look over it\". Seamus Heaney called the translations \"cribs\".", "Hugh MacDiarmid wrote a letter to MacLean in 1977, a year before his death, stating that he and MacLean were the best Scottish poets of the twentieth century. MacDiarmid and MacLean influenced each other's work and maintained an extensive correspondence which has been published. Douglas Young wrote that \"the best poetry written in our generation in the British Isles has been in Scottish Gaelic, by Sorley MacLean.\" John MacInnes called him a \"magisterial writer\" who \"[pushed] Gaelic to its limits\". He said that it is \"truly astonishing\" that Gaelic, so long minoritized, could have produced a writer like MacLean, who could not express what he had to say in any other language: \"Somhairle MacGill-Eain needed Gaelic, and Gaelic needed Somhairle MacGill-Eain\". According to Iain Crichton Smith, translator of MacLean's poetry, D\u00e0in do Eimhir was \"the greatest Gaelic book of this century\", an assessment with which Christopher Whyte agreed. According to Maoilios Caimbeul, MacLean was the best Scottish Gaelic poet of all time. Smith compared the calibre of MacLean's love poetry to that of Catallus and William Butler Yeats. Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney said that MacLean had \"saved Gaelic poetry... for all time\"."]}, {"page": "Jaume Subirana i Ort\u00edn", "response": ["*The Silent Letter (2020, translated by Christopher Whyte)"]}, {"page": "Saltire Society Literary Awards", "response": ["|Christopher Whyte", "| Christopher Whyte (editor)"]}, {"page": "Christopher Whyte (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Christopher Whyte (born 1952), Scottish writer"]}, {"page": "Christopher Whyte (Poet and Novelist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Whyte"]}, {"page": "Cr\u00ecsdean MacIlleBh\u00e0in", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Whyte"]}, {"page": "Cr\u00ecsdean Whyte", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Whyte"]}]}}
