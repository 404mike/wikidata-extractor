Ralph Abercromby (11 February 1842 \u2013 21 June 1897) was a Scottish meteorologist.\nAbercromby was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, the youngest son of the third Lord Abercromby. His mother, Hon. Louisa Penuel Forbes, was a daughter of Lord Medwyn.His obituary in Nature summarises his ancestry, \"Several of his immediate relatives had been eminently distinguished. His great-grandfather, Sir Ralph Abercromby, who died in 1801, in the moment of victory, at the Battle of Alexandria, had served his country with brilliant distinction, in the West Indies (Trinidad) and at the Helder.\" He himself served in the British Army from 1860 to 1869 and was stationed in Quebec.\n\nRalph Abercromby is noted for his contributions to meteorology, his travels producing reports in Seas and skies in many latitudes such as weather and telegraphy at the US signals office. He wrote on the nomenclature of cloud formation, and figured prominently in the history of the classification system developed by Luke Howard; along with Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson (1838-1920) he developed the system laid out by Howard.\nHe attained the rank of lieutenant in the 60th Rifles.

He was the second (but eldest surviving) son of George Abercromby, a lawyer and descendant of the Abercromby family of Birkenbog, Aberdeenshire and Mary Dundas (died 1767), daughter of Ralph Dundas of Manour, Perthshire. His younger brothers include the advocate Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby and General Robert Abercromby.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 4", "In July 1795, Abercromby was nominated by Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas to lead an expedition to the West Indies. That same month he had been made a Knight of the Bath and in August Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Wight \u2013 a reward for his services but also possibly an incentive to lead the army in the Caribbean. The appointment of Abercromby as Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward and Windward Islands was officially announced on 5 August.Carole Divall, General Sir Ralph Abercromby and the French Revolutionary Wars 1792\u20131801, (Barnsley: Pen & Sword, 2019), 72\u201373.", "On 17 March 1796 Abercromby arrived in Carlisle Bay, Barbados on the Arethusa.Divall, General Sir Ralph Abercromby, 84\u201385. A third of the 6,000 troops that had arrived on the island before him had already been sent on to Saint Vincent and Grenada, leaving the general with 3,700 soldiers at his disposal.Martin R. Howard, Death Before Glory: The British Soldier in the West Indies in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars 1793\u20131815, (Barnsley: Pen & Sword Military, 2015), 94. Control of much of Saint Vincent been lost to rebelling French planters and native Caribs since early 1795, while Grenada was in the midst of an insurrection led by Julien F\u00e9don. The reinforcements to Grenada allowed General Nicolls to attack enemy posts south of Port Royal on 25 March, preventing further French reinforcements from Guadeloupe.Howard, Death Before Glory, 94. Three months later Abercromby arrived with further reinforcements and attacked F\u00e9don's camp on 19 June, routing the insurgents and ending the rebellion.", "The British fleet sailed on 25 April 1796 for Saint Lucia, landing the following day and establishing a beachhead. The French were soon repelled and retreated to the fort at Morne Fortune, which Abercromby decided to besiege. The garrison under General Goyrand surrendered to the British army 26 May. The island had been retaken at the cost of 566 men. A force of around 4,000 was left to hold Saint Lucia under the command of John Moore before Abercromby left for Saint Vincent at the beginning of June.Divall, General Sir Ralph Abercromby, 87\u201399.", "Abercromby arrived on Saint Vincent 7 June with a force of just over 4,000. He marched his troops near to the insurgent base at Vigie Ridge and camped nearby as the British started to execute an encircling movement: Quartermaster General John Knox manoeuvred his men on the seaward side in order to prevent the enemy retreating north, and Lieutenant Colonel Dickens used the 34th Regiment as a diversion on the opposite side. Knox was able to cut off communications with the Vigie, whilst Dickens ousted the nearby Caribs to complete the encirclement. The black French commander, Marinier, signed terms of surrender on 11 June and the Caribs did 4 days later. The British took around 200 prisoners, with another 200 escaping into the jungle.Howard, Death Before Glory, 103. Although some of the Caribs would remain in resistance until October, the rebellion had effectively been put down at the cost of 17 officers and 168 men killed or wounded.Divall, General Sir Ralph Abercromby, 99\u2013101.", "After spending time with Dundas over Christmas, Abercromby was summoned to London 21 January 1800. The Portuguese, concerned that they were under threat from Spain, requested British support and wanted Abercromby to lead their army. However, Abercromby refused to serve under a foreign ruler and would only take command of a joint army. Before he could leave for Portugal to inspect their defences and army, the resignation of General Charles Stuart in the Mediterranean in April led to a change of plans. The Austrian plan was that Abercromby could create a distraction from the activities of General Michael von Melas in North Italy by landing at various points on the Italian coast. Abercromby received instruction from London to send 2,500\u20133,000 men to take French-occupied Malta. Thereafter, he was to receive a further 6,000 men to assist the Austrians. General Charles O'Hara in Gibraltar was pleased with the appointment, for while Stuart had been hot-tempered and difficult to work with, Abercromby was \"a reasonable, considerate good soldier, and listens with temper and patience to every proposal made to him\". However, delays caused by the weather meant that the situation in Italy had changed drastically by the time that Abercromby reached Minorca 22 June.Divall, General Sir Ralph Abercromby, 226\u2013230.", "A public house in central Manchester, the 'Sir Ralph Abercromby', is named after him.

The first nomenclature (\"naming\", also \"numbering\") of clouds in English, by Luke Howard, was published in 1802.  It followed a similar effort in French by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1801.  Howard's nomenclature defined four fundamental types of clouds:  cirrus or thread-cloud, cumulus or heap-cloud, stratus or flat cloud (level sheet), and nimbus or rain-cloud (see Classification of clouds).  There followed a long period of development of the field of meteorology and the classification of clouds, leading up to 1896, the International Year of Clouds.  The history of this period is the subject of a popular book, The Invention of Clouds.  During that time, the Englishmen Rev. Clement Ley and Hon. Ralph Abercromby, were influential.  Both men died before the classification was settled, however.  Ley wrote a book, Cloudland, that is well known to meteorologists.  Abercromby contributed a number of papers on the subject, stressing the most important (and then novel) fact that clouds are the same everywhere in the world.  He also wrote in collaboration with Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson a detailed classification of clouds.  This was adopted in Hildebrandsson's 1890 Cloud Atlas."]}, {"page": "International Cloud Atlas", "response": ["The first edition was inspired in part by the observation of the English meteorologist Ralph Abercromby that clouds were of the same general kinds everywhere in the world.
