Barnsley came close to equalising close to the end of the first half, but shortly after the break it was Southampton who scored next through Jay Rodriguez, although this was soon to be cancelled out by Stephen Dawson for the home side. In the 66th minute, Emmanuel Mayuka scored his first goal for the club on only his third start for the club in a year, and later in the game debuts were given to winger Omar Rowe, midfielder Harrison Reed, and forward Jake Sinclair.
