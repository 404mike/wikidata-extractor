At the time of demerger Sir Neville Simms was appointed executive chairman of the business.

In particular, the housing division continued to invest heavily in land even though the market had peaked, leading to provisions of \u00a3132m in that division alone. Like his predecessor before him, Pountain was forced to step down as chief executive to be replaced by Neville Simms, previously in charge of construction.  Inevitably, the emphasis moved away from housing in favour of construction."]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Crediton", "response": ["* Sir Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac from 1992 to 1999"]}, {"page": "Neville Ian Simms", "response": ["#REDIRECT Neville Simms"]}]}}
