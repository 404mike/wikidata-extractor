He played 29 times in 1901\u201302, being used in all three midfield positions, but lost his first team place at the Victoria Ground in 1902\u201303 and made only 10 appearances. He left for Manchester City at the end of the season, who had just won promotion into the First Division. In his one season at Hyde Road, he won the 1904 FA Cup at Crystal Palace after injury prevented Billy Holmes from playing; City beat Bolton Wanderers 1\u20130. City also finished second in the Football League, three points behind The Wednesday. However Ashworth featured in just 22 games all season, and then went on to play for Reading in the Southern League, and then played 11 league games for First Division runners-up Everton in 1904\u201305, before returning to Staffordshire with Second Division side Burslem Port Vale in October 1905. His appearances during the season were restricted due to other commitments, and he left the Athletic Ground in the summer.
