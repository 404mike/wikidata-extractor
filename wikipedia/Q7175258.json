Konig was a right-handed batsman who played as a wicket-keeper.\nBorn in Vienna to Jewish parents, his family likely fled Austria following its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938, arriving in the United Kingdom at some point thereafter. Konig later made a single first-class appearance for Leicestershire against Northamptonshire at the County Ground, Northampton in 1949. In Northamptonshire's first-innings of 239 all out, Konig made a single stumping when he stumped Gordon Garlick off the bowling of Gerry Lester. In Leicestershire's first-innings response, Konig was the last man out, dismissed for 6 runs by Des Barrick. In Northamptonshire's second-innings of 350/5 declared, Konig caught Percy Davis off the bowling of Charles Wooler. This was his only major appearance for the county.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter K\u00f6nig", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Konig"]}, {"page": "Konig, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Konig"]}]}}
