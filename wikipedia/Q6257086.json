Although these three races were recognised as the most important races of the season for three-year-old colts, the term Triple Crown was not used until some years later. The only previous attempt by a winner of the Guineas and Derby to win the Leger had been ten years earlier, when Cotherstone, also trained by John Scott, had started odds-on favourite but had been beaten a head by Nutwith. When Frank Butler was told that some had expressed doubts about the Derby winner staying the distance he replied that \"he'll stay a thundering deal too long for any of them: the faster they go the sooner it will be over\". The race attracted nine other runners, including Sittingbourne who was accompanied by his pacemaker Feversham, and West Australian was made the 6/4 favourite. Sittingbourne took the early lead as Feversham struggled to reach the front and Butler settled the favourite towards the back of the field. The Reiver and Rataplan moved past Sittingbourne on the turn into the straight, with West Australian moving steadily closer. Butler moved the favorite up to challenge The Reiver a furlong from the finish and West Australian went clear \"without the slightest effort\" to win by three lengths with the rest of the runners finishing at wide intervals.

In a related poll, the electors were asked to choose the single greatest horse they had ever seen. In this poll, West Australian finished third behind Gladiateur and Isonomy.

Despite this loss, trainer John Scott, who was seeing the horse for the first time, proclaimed that the horse would \"carry off the St Leger\", and ordered him to be brought to Malton in Yorkshire. Touchstone suffered an eventful journey, after his accompanying groom drank at too many inns and allowed the horse to escape into the wild.

He started favourite at odds of 8/13 against seven rivals. In the early stages, he was badly hampered as the other jockeys attempted to \u201cbox\u201d him in a \"ruck\" against the rails, and Marson decided to change tactics. Instead of holding the colt up for a late run, he took Voltigeur into the lead at the turn into the straight and attempted to win from the front. In the closing stages Voltigeur began to tire and was caught in the last strides by Russborough, despite being hard ridden by Marson who had to use his spurs on the favourite. The judge declared a dead-heat, and with the owners of the colts failing to reach an agreement to divide the stakes, the two colts had to race again over the same course later that afternoon. Hill had planned to rest Voltigeur in his stable before the rematch but was advised by John Scott that if he did so he \"might as well shoot him through the head\" as he would stiffen up. Hill therefore kept Voltigeur walking round until he was called out for the deciding heat. At the second attempt, Marson was able to ride a waiting race on Voltigeur, tracking Russborough before moving ahead inside the final furlong to win \"cleverly\" by a length. The win, described by the Liverpool Albion as \"one of the most memorable on record\", provoked scenes of enthusiastic and prolonged celebrations by the Yorkshire crowd.

The colt was ridden in most of his important races by the trainer's younger brother, Bill Scott. Cotherstone was not an impressive individual at first, being weak and sickly as a yearling, and making little progress as a two-year-old. He was described as being \"thin-fleshed\" and \"always amiss\".", "In early 1843 an impressive performance in a training gallop with a good horse name All Fours convinced Bowes and John Scott that Cotherstone was a serious contender for the Derby. Bill Scott, who rode the colt in the trial was convinced that he was the best that he had ever ridden. Bowes placed a series of large bets on the colt and arranged for strict security measures at the Malton stables to protect him from any attempts by unscrupulous bookmakers to \"nobble\" (deliberately injure) him. Cotherstone made his first public appearance as a three-year-old at the Craven meeting at Newmarket on 17 April when ran in the Riddlesworth Stakes. Ridden by Frank Butler, he settled in second place before going clear in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Pompey. His odds for the Derby were immediately shortened from 20/1 to 12/1. Two days later he added the Column Produce Stakes, in which the beaten horses included the filly Extempore, who went on to win the 1000 Guineas. So impressive were Cotherstone's performances that when he returned to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas at the Spring meeting, only two horses turned out to oppose him. Starting at odds of 1/3 he won by three lengths in \"a mere canter\" from Cornopean and Mallard.", "Shortly before the 1843 Derby, John Scott moved Cotherstone from Malton to complete his preparations at a stable at Leatherhead, where the colt was visited and viewed at exercise by the Queen and Prince Albert. At Epsom on 31 May, Cotherstone started 13/8 favourite for the Derby in a field of twenty-three runners, with Gaper being made second choice at 5/1. Despite the damp and misty weather, the race attracted the customary huge crowd, which included Prince George of Cambridge and his brother-in-law the Prince Royal of Mecklenburg. After a delay caused by the behaviour of a colt named Highlander, the race began with Gaper taking an early lead. The second favourite set such a strong pace that most of the runners were soon struggling and only four other horses\u2013 Khorassan, Cotherstone, Siricol and Gorhambury\u2013 were still in contention when the leader turned into the straight. Gaper then began to tire and Bill Scott sent Cotherstone into the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish. Gorhambury (rumoured to be a four-year-old \"ringer\") emerged as his only challenger, but the result was never in serious doubt as the favourite steadily increased his advantage to win easily by two lengths. Apart from the \u00a34,250 prize money, Bowes took an estimated \u00a330,000 in winning bets. Celebrations at Malton were delayed, however, as the homing pigeons dispatched to convey the news of Cotherstone's victory failed to arrive."]}, {"page": "Attila (horse)", "response": ["Attila was a small, but strongly built colt of a rich bay or brown colour with a white blaze. He was described as good-tempered horse with a \"peculiar, Arab-looking head\" but \"excellent loins\" and \"very fine quarters\".

The weather was fine and sunny and the huge crowd included the Queen and Prince Albert. Launcelot, trained by John Scott and ridden by his brother Bill started favourite at 9/4. In the race, Macdonald settled Little Wonder in fifth or sixth place in the early stages before moving him up to third on the turn into the straight. Most of the runners were already struggling as the unnamed \"Melody colt\", Launcelot and Little Wonder pulled clear. While the two fancied colts struggled \"very severely\" for the lead, Macdonald was \"quietly closing\" on Little Wonder. Inside the final furlong, Macdonald produced the outsider with \"one tremendous rush\" along the inside rail to take the lead and win by a length from Launcelot with the Melody colt two lengths further back. Although the result was a huge upset, some commentators pointed out that a strict interpretation of his two-year-old form against Assassin should have led to him being regarded as a serious contender. George Tattersall, in \"The Cracks of the Day\" wrote that \"whilst Launcelot and Melody were fighting for the bone, our little lurcher crept in quietly and carried it off\". After the race, Macdonald received a gold-tipped riding-whip  from Prince Albert as a testimonial.

In a career that lasted from May 1835 to October 1836 he ran ten times and won four races. In May 1835 he recorded his most important success on his racecourse debut when he won The Derby. Mundig was the first Derby winner to be trained in the North of England and the first of five trained at Malton, North Yorkshire by John Scott. Mundig was given a very hard race at Epsom and never reproduced his Derby-winning form: his subsequent successes came in relatively unimportant races. After his retirement he was exported to stand as a stallion in Prussia.", "Mundig was a powerfully-built dark chestnut horse standing 15.3 hands high with a white star and a white sock on his hind leg. He was owned and bred by John Bowes at Streatlam Castle, County Durham. Bowes had inherited a large fortune when very young. In 1835, when Mundig was foaled, Bowes reached the age of twenty-one and gained full control of his property and wealth: \"M\u00fcndig\" is German for \"of age\", but the Germanic umlaut was not used in spelling the name.

The Colonel, one of the leading two-year-olds of the previous season when he had easily beaten Lepanto, was made favourite at 7/2. The Colonel was trained in Yorkshire by John Scott and ridden by his brother Bill, while Cadland was ridden by his usual jockey James \"Jem\" Robinson. After two false starts, the race got under way with Robinson immediately sending Cadland into the lead. He set a strong pace and by the turn into the straight at Tattenham Corner, The Colonel, Zinganee, Alcaston and Omen were the only other horses left in contention. In the straight the race became a match between the first and second favourites who ran side by side throughout the final quarter mile. A furlong from the finish The Colonel gained a slight advantage, but Cadland rallied and the two colts crossed the line together. After a short delay the judge declared a dead-heat. According to the rules of the day, such a result required the horses to run again over the same course unless both of the owners agreed to divide the prize money. The Colonel's owner, Mr Petrie, declared that he had no intention of dividing and so the deciding heat took place after the next race. A description of the day in The Sporting Oracle claims the mood was one of \"concentrated and absolutely astounding excitement\". For the rematch, The Colonel started a slight favourite, with the view being taken that his stamina and \"stouter\" pedigree would be decisive. Some observers, however, noticed that Bill Scott was \"nervous almost to the point of agitation\" at the prospect of taking on Robinson, who was known for his excellence in closely run races. Robinson himself, by contrast, appeared calm and collected, pausing for a pinch of snuff before mounting for the rematch. Once again Cadland made the early running before The Colonel moved up to challenge him in the straight. On this occasion, however, the Northern horse was unable to get to the lead and Cadland maintained a narrow advantage throughout the closing stages to win by a margin reported as either a neck or half a length.

Despite his lack of a recent run he was made 7/2 favourite in a field of nineteen runners which included The Derby winner Frederick and the previously undefeated colts Voltaire and Sir Hercules. Ridden by Bill Scott, Rowton led from the start and set an extremely strong pace. In the closing stages he was challenged by Voltaire, who had come from well back in the field, but under a \"severe\" ride from Scott, Rowton held on to win by half a length, with Sir Hercules in third. Voltaire was considered by some to have been an unlucky loser, with his jockey, Sam Chifney being criticised for his exaggerated waiting tactics. His owner, Lord Darlington however, declined the offer of a match race between the two colts, even when Rowton's connections offered to run the race with the St Leger winner carrying seven pounds more than his rival. Rowton's success was a third consecutive win in the race for John Scott and Edward Petre following Matilda in 1827 and The Colonel in 1828. On the following afternoon, Rowton was able to claim a \u00a3350 prize for his owner without having to race when he was allowed to walk over in the Foal Stakes, the other five entrants having been withdrawn.", "John Scott had predicted that Rowton would be better at four, but the horse had little chance to prove his trainer correct as his third season consisted of a single race. On 22 September, one year and four days after his last appearance, he ran in a sweepstakes for four-year-olds over the St Leger course at Doncaster. Ridden as usual by Bill Scott, he started 1/2 favourite and won from his only opponent, Lord Cleveland's colt Stotforth.", "In death, Rowton was partly returned to Yorkshire, as one of his leg bones was made into the handle of a carving knife used by John Scott in his dining room at Malton."]}, {"page": "The Colonel (horse)", "response": ["Originally trained in Yorkshire by John Scott, The Colonel later moved to the royal stable and won races for two British monarchs. Following his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Britain and Germany with moderate results, although some of his descendants achieved success in Australia.", "The Colonel was a \"compact\" chestnut horse with a broad white blaze standing 15.2 hands high. He was owned and bred by Edward Petre (1794\u20131848), a free-spending sportsman and gambler, who was a younger son of Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre. The Colonel was sired by the Duke of Grafton's horse Whisker who won the 1815 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful breeding stallion. His dam, an unnamed daughter of Delpini also produced My Lady, an influential broodmare whose modern descendants include Midway Lady and Eswarah. Like the rest of Edward Petre's horses, The Colonel was trained by John Scott, who sent out the winners of 41 classics, from his Whitewall Stables at Malton in North Yorkshire. The colt was ridden in most of his early races by his trainer's younger brother Bill Scott.", "The Colonel returned to Yorkshire and did not run again before challenging for the St Leger at Doncaster in September. John Scott had another contender for the race in the talented but injury-prone colt Velocipede who had not been entered for the Derby. In a trial gallop shortly before the race, Velocipede decisively defeated The Colonel but sustained a leg injury in the process and appeared at Doncaster with his legs heavily bandaged. Another leading fancy for the race was the filly Bessy Bedlam, the only horse to have beaten Velocipede. In a field of nineteen runners, The Colonel, ridden as usual by Bill Scott, started the 3/1 favourite ahead of Velocipede on 7/2. After the chaotic start to the 1827 St Leger the jockeys were warned by the racecourse officials that no misconduct would be tolerated and the race began in a fair and orderly manner. Scott positioned The Colonel in third or fourth place as Velocipede made the running from Bessy Bedlam. The filly was beaten before the straight, and when Velocipede weakened a furlong from the finish The Colonel took the lead pursued by the 35/1 outsider Belinda. In the closing stages The Colonel went clear and won easily by three lengths from Belinda, with Velocipede in third. Despite the apparently decisive nature of the victory, the Sporting Magazine considered the race to be an unsatisfactory one for at least two reasons: the Scotts were criticised for using Velocipede as a pacemaker rather than allowing him to compete on his own merits, and there were strong rumours that Bessy Bedlam had been prevented from showing her best form by some kind of \"foul play\". Two days after his win in the St Leger, The Colonel was able to claim an uncontroversial victory when he was allowed to walk over in a sweepstakes over the same course and distance."]}, {"page": "Matilda (horse)", "response": ["Matilda was a \"small, fidgety, temperamental\" bay mare owned and bred by Edward Petre (1794\u20131848), a free-spending sportsman and gambler, who was a younger son of Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre. Matilda was the seventh foal of Lord Egremont's mare Juliana, a daughter of Platina, the winner of the 1795 Epsom Oaks. Platina was a sister of Chestnut Skim, the female-line ancestor of Frederick, Election and The Merry Monarch. Matilda was sired by Comus, a descendant of the Godolphin Arabian who finished third in the 1812 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful sire of winners. Like the rest of Petre's horses, Matilda was trained by John Scott, who sent out the winners of 41 classics, from his Whitewall Stables at Malton in North Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "Port Stakes", "response": ["| John Scott"]}, {"page": "Margrave (British horse)", "response": ["Margrave was a very dark-coated chestnut with no white markings. He was a large, powerful colt, standing 16 hands high, but not an attractive individual, being described as \"a great, ugly horse... with lopping ears\". As a three-year-old, he was trained by John Scott, who sent out the winners of 41 classics, from his Whitewall Stables at Malton in North Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "Elis (horse)", "response": ["From as early as the autumn 1835, Elis had been regarded as a leading contender for the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse in late September, but when the horse was still in Goodwood a week before the race his chances appeared remote. In the 1830s, the established way for a horse to travel to a racecourse was to walk there, usually at a very gentle pace to minimise the risk of injury, and the 250 mile journey from Goodwood to Doncaster could take up to three weeks. Despite the fact that it appeared impossible for Elis to run in the St Leger he continued to be supported in the betting, which led to considerable confusion until Bentinck's plans were revealed. A specially designed carriage or \"caravan\" had been constructed which could be drawn at high speed by a team of horses whose members could be replaced at regular intervals. Elis and a travelling companion named The Drummer were loaded into the padded interior of the caravan and were transported to Doncaster in less than three days: there was even time to pause and give the horses an exercise gallop at Lichfield Racecourse. The project had been kept secret to allow Bentinck and his confederates to back the horse at longer odds than would otherwise been available. On 20 September, Elis started at odds of 7/2 for the St Leger, with the John Scott-trained Scroggins being made the 6/4 favourite in what was considered an unusually strong field. Ridden as usual by John Day, Elis took the lead at half way and was never seriously challenged, winning easily from Scroggins, who got the better of a \"neck and neck\" struggle with Beeswing for second place. The connections of the winner were reported to have taken approximately \u00a324,000 in winning bets."]}, {"page": "Don John (horse)", "response": ["Don John was a bay horse standing 15 hands three inches high with a white sock on his left hind leg. He was bred by Mr Garforth and sold as a foal for 140 guineas to Robert Ridsdale and at Ridsdale's dispersal sale in 1836, the yearling was bought by George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield. Lord Chesterfield, however, was listed as the colt's breeder in the General Stud Book, and the exact relationship between Chesterfield's racing interests and those of the Ridsdale brothers was somewhat unclear. Lord Chesterfield sent Don John into training with John Scott who trained forty classic winners at his base at Whitewall stables, Malton, North Yorkshire. The colt was ridden in most of his important races by the trainer's younger brother, Bill Scott."]}, {"page": "Charles the Twelfth", "response": ["Charles the Twelfth was a \"very fine and racing-like\" dark brown horse standing sixteen hands high bred by Major Nicholas Yarburgh of Heslington Hall in North Yorkshire.

He was also a successful stallion, becoming British champion sire four times. Touchstone sired many Classic winners including the Derby winners Cotherstone, Orlando and Surplice. Newminster's dam was Beeswing, a daughter of Doctor Syntax. Beeswing was a successful racemare who raced for many years. Her wins included six Newcastle Gold Cups, four Doncaster Cups and one Ascot Gold Cup. Beeswing also foaled the 2000 Guineas winner Nunnykirk, who was also sired by Touchstone.
