He was born in Larne, although of Scottish descent, returning to Dundee in 1901.\nBrown, a full-back, played for a local junior side Dundee North End F.C before joining Welsh side Llanelli for the 1922\u201323 season. He moved to Rochdale in 1923, making his debut in the opening game of 1923\u201324, a 2\u20130 home win against Durham. Bill played 178 league games for Rochdale without finding the net and completed a run of 85 successive games toward the end of the 26/27 season. He was part of the Rochdale side which defeated Chesterfield 8-1 during the same campaign, a club record which stands today. Originally a left back he was switched to the right back position during this period. However, after a loss to New Brighton the following season he was dropped and subsequently released after 5 years with the club. His last match was a 1\u20130 home win against Doncaster on 5 May 1928.\nBrown joined Torquay United in 1928. He started the first game of the 1928\u201329 season, a 4\u20133 defeat at home to Queens Park Rangers. He did however struggle to establish himself and left Plainmoor, after playing 16 times, to join Dundalk after losing his place in defence to Sid Cann. Following his career Bill returned to Dundee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Willie Brown", "response": ["Willie Brown may refer to:", "*Willie Brown (footballer, born 1900) (1896/1900\u20131977), Scottish footballer (Rochdale AFC, Torquay United)", "*Willie Brown (footballer, born 1922) (1922\u20131978), Scottish football player (Preston North End, Grimsby Town) and manager (Barrow AFC)", "*Willie Brown (footballer, born 1928), Scottish footballer (Forfar Athletic, Accrington Stanley)", "*Willie Brown (footballer, born 1938), Scottish footballer (Accrington Stanley, Chester City, Greenock Morton)", "*Willie Brown (footballer, born 1950), Scottish footballer (Newport County, Torquay United)", "*Willie Brown (American football) (1940-2019), American football Hall-of-Fame cornerback", "*Willie Brown (American football, born 1942) (1942\u20132018), Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach", "*Willie Brown (golfer) (c. 1858\u2013?), 19th century Scottish golfer", "*Willie Brown (rugby league), former Sydney Roosters rugby league player", "*Willie Brown (musician) (1900\u20131952), American delta blues guitarist and singer", "*Willie Brown (politician) (born 1934), mayor of San Francisco, 1996\u20132004, Speaker of the California State Assembly, 1980\u20131995", "*Miss Willie Brown, an American country music duo", "*Willie Browne (1936\u20132004), Irish soccer player"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=left|Willie Brown"]}, {"page": "Willie Brown (footballer born 1900)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Willie Brown (footballer, born 1900)"]}]}}
