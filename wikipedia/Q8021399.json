He was born in Larne, although of Scottish descent, returning to Dundee in 1901.\nBrown, a full-back, played for a local junior side Dundee North End F.C before joining Welsh side Llanelli for the 1922\u201323 season. He moved to Rochdale in 1923, making his debut in the opening game of 1923\u201324, a 2\u20130 home win against Durham. Bill played 178 league games for Rochdale without finding the net and completed a run of 85 successive games toward the end of the 26/27 season. He was part of the Rochdale side which defeated Chesterfield 8-1 during the same campaign, a club record which stands today. Originally a left back he was switched to the right back position during this period. However, after a loss to New Brighton the following season he was dropped and subsequently released after 5 years with the club. His last match was a 1\u20130 home win against Doncaster on 5 May 1928.\nBrown joined Torquay United in 1928. He started the first game of the 1928\u201329 season, a 4\u20133 defeat at home to Queens Park Rangers. He did however struggle to establish himself and left Plainmoor, after playing 16 times, to join Dundalk after losing his place in defence to Sid Cann. Following his career Bill returned to Dundee.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
