After two years, he moved to Helsinki to work for Fiskars, but because of the Crimean War he was  arrested due to his nationality and transferred to Saint Petersburg. He was soon released with help from family connections and he remained working for Izhorsk Works for eight years.\nIn 1862, Crichton returned to Turku after receiving an offer to buy half of Cowie & Eriksson Company. The company was renamed W:m Crichton & C:o and under Crichton's leadership it developed into the largest company in Turku.

In 1850 the company hired Scottish engineer William Crichton to accomplish installation and commissioning of the 300-hp engine; the project took three years in total. The ship was launched at the Turku Old Shipyard in 1851 and handed over in 1853, after which Crichton left the company.", "The company suffered of lack of orders during the Crimean War. Eriksson decided to give up the business and sold his share of the company to local investor Erik Julin in 1857. After this the company operated under name D. Cowie & C:o. Julin started to seek for a partner who had experience about marine industry and business knowledge. He wrote a letter to William Crichton, who lived then in Kolpino, close to Saint Petersburg, and suggested him to buy Cowie's share of the company. Crichton took the offer and moved in Turku in 1862, after which the company was named W:m Crichton & C:o. Crichton was up to date about the latest development of naval engineering: propellers were replacing paddle wheels, wood gave way to steel and compound technology was entering in steam engines; this was enabled by the recently invented fire-tube boilers which withstood higher pressure.", "In the early 1870s W:m Crichton & C:o employed 400 people. Most of the sales came from steam engines and other machinery, and just 30% of turnover came from ships. The company produced most of the needed tools, even drilling and turning machines, in its own workshops. Rapid growth of the company and the large orders required investments and various financial arrangements, creating large risks to its owners. At about the same time with making quotation for S/S Finland in 1874, the owners converted W:m Crichton & C:o a limited company in order to assure their personal property. The capital was 1\u00a0500\u00a0000\u00a0marks which was divided into 30 shares, each of 50\u00a0000\u00a0marks value; 20 shares were owned by William Crichton and 10 shares by trading house Julin. Erik Julin died already in the same year, after which the trading house was led by his son John Julin.", "Due to the growing demand of larger ships Crichton became interested at the Turku Old Shipyard company located at the opposite side of river Aura. The yard had capacity for building large hulls. During the 1870s William Crichton grew his ownership in the Turku Old Shipyard and by the end of the decade he became majority shareholder and was appointed head of the company in 1878. Straight after this Crichton started investments at the old yard to enable building of large steel hulls; a workshop was built for bending steel ribs and after few years there were sheet steel forming and riveting facilities. When Crichton received two large orders with two steel ships in each in 1881, the hull production of Solovetski, Murmanski, Zurukan and Spasiteliy was subcontracted from the Old Shipyard. During that year Crichton handed over total 12 vessels, including customs boat Wiikinki, paddle steamer Krasnovodsk and six smaller vessels. Crichton became sole owner in 1883 and merged the yard to his own company. Subsequently, W:m Crichton & C:o became by far the largest company of Turku; the headcount was 936 and turnover 1\u00a0589\u00a0000\u00a0marks.", "The company faced a major loss in April 1889 when William Crichton passed away just at the age of 62 years. John Eager took his post as company manager. None of Crichton's 12 children wanted to take the business. Shortly after four shares were sold to Eager, one to the major funding bank Nordiska Aktiebanken f\u00f6r Handel och Industrie. In the 1890s 13 of the remaining 15 shares were sold. Count Anatol Orloff-Davidoff from Saint Petersburg bought 12 shares and another nobleman from the same city, Ludwig von Havemann, bought one share. Supposedly, the Russia-based owners contributed the rapid growth of the company after the mid-1890s, but speculatively they also initiated the disastrous decision of starting operations in Saint Petersburg."]}, {"page": "Erik Julin", "response": ["In 1838 Julin became board member in \u00c5bo Gamla Skeppswarf, Turku old shipyard.

Julin had a key role in promoting investments at the yard and made deals of ships delivered to the Russian-American Company. Julin gained a strong foothold in the Turku shipbuilding industry after together with his business partner William Crichton he took over engineering company Cowie & Eriksson.

Crichton's company bankrupted in 1913, after which local businessmen Ernst and Magnus Dahlstr\u00f6m founded Ab Crichton to continue shipbuilding. As all the Finnish shipbuilders, Ab Crichton suffered of low order intake at the early 1920s; it went together with its competitor and neighbour Ab Vulcan in 1924. The new company name became Ab Crichton-Vulcan Oy and its manager became Allan Staffans.Knorring: Osakeyhti\u00f6 Crichton. pp. 79\u201384.

By time Crichton-Vulcan grew the biggest shipbuilding company of Finland. The major owner became Helsinki-based Kone- ja Siltarakennus which also owned the Hietalahti shipyard.
