There was a large debate after which Kirkland met the leader of the American woman delegates, Lucretia Mott. This event, and an article on \"Women's rights and duties\" in the Edinburgh Review of 1841, may have inspired Kirkland's book A Plea for Women, written in 1843. Anne Knight sent a copy of this book to Lucretia Mott with her highest recommendation, and its influence grew in America. A Plea for Women is most likely the first work in Britain or the USA that gave importance to gaining both civil and political rights for women. The book was especially significant in the early years of the women's suffrage movement in the USA. A Plea for Woman was, as Susanne Ferguson points out in the preface to the modern reprint of the first edition, \"a landmark book as the first to be written by a woman, for women, specifically arguing that the possession of the vote is crucial in ending discrimination\" against women in education and employment, and to gain equal rights under the law."]}, {"page": "1862 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 November \u2013 Anne Knight, social reformer (b. 1786)"]}, {"page": "Anne Knight", "response": ["Anne Knight (2 November 1786 \u2013 4 November 1862)Edward H.
