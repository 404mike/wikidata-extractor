This is supported by the fact that Van Vollenhoven had occasionally appeared at centre and even played one game at full-back. He established himself as a strong defensive wingman, capable of rushing over to the other flank to pull off try-saving cover tackles, whilst he was a stronger player than looks would suggest. The 1960s were a golden era for wingers in the British league, and debate continues to this day over who can lay claim to be the premier winger of the generation.

Over the span of his career he came to be known as one of the best centres in the modern game and formed a devastating partnership with Billy Boston somewhat because of this combination he went on to represent the Great Britain national side making his d\u00e9but in 1957. After his retirement from playing rugby league in 1969, Ashton went on to coach Wigan as well as Leeds, St. Helens, England and Great Britain; he also had a brief stint as chairman of St Helens in 1996. He was a member of the St Helens board for fifteen years.", "In 1954, Ashton was spotted playing rugby union during his national service in the Royal Artillery and was subsequently invited for a trial with Wigan. He attended the trial and was seen by the directors of the club as being a player with exceptional talent, after Wigan offered him a spot in their top level side he offered his home town club St. Helens the chance to sign him but they passed and he then signed for Wigan in 1955 for \u00a3150. He made his first representative later that year, appearing for Lancashire against New Zealand. He represented Rest of the World in the 11-20 defeat by Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 29 June 1957, and represented Great Britain & France in the 37-31 victory over New Zealand at Carlaw Park, Auckland on 3 July 1957. After signing for Wigan he quickly linked up with Welsh  Billy Boston, and formed one of the most devastating right-hand side threequarters partnerships of modern times. Ashton played right-, i.e. number 3, in the 8-13 defeat by Oldham in the 1956\u201357 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1957\u201358 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 19 October 1957.

It was a position he would go on to hold for the next twelve years. He made his international d\u00e9but at the age of 22 for the Great Britain side against France in 1957. He would go on to collect a total of 26 caps for the Great Britain side with his first Southern Hemisphere tour coming in 1957 as the British side competed in the World Cup. He was a true professional in every sense, being sent off just twice in his whole career and due to his professionalism, talent and intelligence he would go on to achieve a long and distinguished footballing career. Ashton's honours and achievements are nothing short of impressive, with 3 victorious Wembley Stadium Challenge Cup finals (out of a possible six), a Championship in 1960, a Lancashire Challenge Cup and two Lancashire League Championships as well as a BBC Floodlit trophy.

It's usually said that Ashton's greatest moment could have come in the 1962 tour to Australasia when while captaining Great Britain to an almost complete whitewash over the Australians, a last minute refereeing decision ruined the chance of this occurring. In total Ashton captained Great Britain 15 times. He was coach and captain, played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored a conversion in the 20-16 victory over Hunslet in the 1964\u201365 Challenge Cup Final during the 1964\u201365 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 8 May 1965, in front of a crowd of 89,016.
