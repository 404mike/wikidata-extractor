Cunliffe was described as being a bit of a dandy.Like a number of other Music Hall stars, he chose to sing slightly risqu\u00e9 songs (like \"Tight skirts have got to go\" or \"Let's have free trade amongst the girls\"). His songs often also referred to political questions of the day and have a generally conservative tone (\"Do you believe in women's rights?\" \"Blame it on poor old Lloyd George.\" \"You'll get on in England if you're not an Englishman\".) Generally, his political songs were conservative in outlook. His 1914 song \"Tow the row row\" for example both laughs at the forced feeding in prison of suffragettes a couple of years earlier, and denounces the Social Insurance laws put in place by Lloyd George's government in 1911.\nCunliffe was an enthusiastic supporter of the First World War and was involved in  a great many concerts raising money to help the war drive.\nCunliffe was referred to as the last surviving Lion comique, the first great music hall singers. \"Whit Cunliffe and Charles Whittle were indeed great singers of great songs and the epitome of what made Music Hall\".Cunliffe died in Battle, East Sussex, aged 90.", "link_mentions": {}}}
