Dean Beckwith put Hereford ahead before JJ Melligan and Adam Boyd gave Orient the win. Orient then continued the season with multiple poor results and performances throughout September and October and their only wins were away matches against Walsall and Southend United in the Football League Trophy first round. However Orient were knocked out of the trophy in the following round in an away match at Brighton & Hove Albion. They were in 22nd position in the League One table. Orient booked a place in the second round of the FA Cup after beating Colchester United 1\u20130. Two Goals from Jason Demetriou and Danny Granville in a 1\u20132 away victory against Bradford City put Orient through to the third round of the FA Cup where they played Sheffield United at home. They lost 4\u20131 and, after a run of bad form in the league, Orient parted company with manager Martin Ling and assistant Dean Smith. Youth team manager Kevin Nugent was named caretaker manager overseeing three games. On 5 February 2009 Geraint Williams was announced as manager until the end of the season. He enjoyed a very positive start, winning seven of his first nine matches and moving Orient up to 15th. After Geraint Williams' positive influence on the team they secured their League One status on 13 April with a 1\u20130 win over Swindon Town at the County Ground and eventually finished the season in 14th place.", "On 3 April 2010 Geraint Williams was sacked as manager after a 3\u20131 home defeat to fellow relegation strugglers Hartlepool following a poor run of form. Kevin Nugent once again took control for the 2\u20131 defeat at Southampton on 5 April and after the match Russell Slade was named as manager until the end of the season. With even less time to save Orient from relegation than Williams before him, Slade managed to bring about a change in form that saw Orient finish in 17th place, just one point but four places clear of relegation. In the summer of 2010 Slade's contract was extended for two years. After a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season, Orient's league form picked up towards Christmas, culminating in an 8\u20132 win against non-league Droylsden in an FA Cup second round replay. In a game described as \"the weirdest football match ever\", Orient had trailed most of the game 2\u20130 but scored six goals in extra time to progress into the third round. Orient then beat high-flying Championship side Norwich City 1\u20130 at Carrow Road to progress into the fourth round where they met another Championship side, Swansea City, at the Liberty Stadium. Orient beat Swansea 2\u20131 to set up a glamour fifth round tie against Premier League giants Arsenal at Brisbane Road, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw thanks to a late Jonathan T\u00e9hou\u00e9 equaliser for the O's. This set up a replay at the Emirates Stadium. Leyton Orient lost that replay 0\u20135, bringing to an end their longest run in the FA Cup since 1981\u201382. Either side of the Arsenal games, Leyton Orient achieved a club record-equalling 14\u00a0games unbeaten, putting the team just outside the play-off positions. However they were unable to maintain that momentum and ultimately missed out on the play-offs by just one point.", "The 2014\u201315 season saw a reversal of fortunes for Orient after the club was taken over by Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti. Long-standing manager Russell Slade left early in the season and was replaced by caretaker manager Kevin Nugent, followed in quick succession by Mauro Milanese and then Fabio Liverani before Christmas 2014. A disastrous second half of the season meant that Orient was relegated from League One after a 2\u20132 draw at Swindon Town on the final day. Liverani, with only eight wins in 27 matches, left the club by mutual consent on 13 May 2015."]}, {"page": "Barnet F.C.", "response": ["In their first season back in the Football League, Martin Allen led the team to a 15th-place finish with a final end of season win away at Crawley Town with a finishing result of 3-0.

Rossi Eames and Henry Newman were appointed joint interim head coach with Newman leaving three months later on 14 February 2017. This was followed by the appointment of Kevin Nugent who only lasted two months with one win in 11 games before being parting company with Barnet.
