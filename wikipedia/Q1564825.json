His performing career spanned more than four decades.  As a writer and composer, he created 18 comic operas, nearly 100 musical sketches, some 600 songs and piano pieces, three books and both serious and comic pieces for newspapers and magazines.\nGrossmith created a series of nine characters in the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan from 1877 to 1889, including Sir Joseph Porter, in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance (1880) and Ko-Ko in The Mikado (1885\u201387). He also wrote, in collaboration with his brother Weedon, the 1892 comic novel The Diary of a Nobody.\nGrossmith was also famous in his day for performing his own comic piano sketches and songs, both before and after his Gilbert and Sullivan days, becoming the most popular British solo performer of the 1890s. Some of his comic songs endure today, including \"See Me Dance the Polka\".  He continued to perform into the first decade of the 20th century.  His son, George Grossmith Jr., became an actor, playwright and producer of Edwardian musical comedies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gilbert and Sullivan", "response": ["The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S.

Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage.

Instead, a \"miscellaneous entertainment\" was given at the Gaiety, consisting of ventriloquists, performing dogs and, coincidentally, a sketch parodying a penny reading by the young George Grossmith, who, several years later, became Gilbert and Sullivan's principal comedian.Moss, Simon. \"Gilbert & Sullivan: A Selling Exhibition of Memorabilia\", accessed 30 October 2007"]}, {"page": "The Grand Duke", "response": ["Mr. and Mrs. Carte hired a new soprano, the Hungarian Ilka P\u00e1lmay, who had recently arrived in England and quickly made a favourable impression on London audiences and critics with her charming personality.Ainger, p. 358  Gilbert devised a new plot line revolving around P\u00e1lmay, making her character, Julia, an English actress among a company of German actors, with the topsy-turvy conceit that her \"strong English accent\" was forgiven by her audiences because of her great dramatic artistry.  Rutland Barrington's role, Ludwig, became the leading comedian of the theatrical company and the central role in the opera.Wolfson, pp. 88\u201391  Gilbert had paired the title character with contralto Rosina Brandram, causing Sullivan to suggest some different pairings of the characters, but Gilbert and the Cartes disagreed; Mrs. Carte went so far as to caution Sullivan that his ideas would upset the casting.Shepherd, pp. xviii\u2013xx  Unhappily for Gilbert, three of his usual principal players, George Grossmith, Richard Temple and Jessie Bond, who he had originally thought would play the title character, the prince and the princess, all left the company before rehearsals began for The Grand Duke, and so he reduced the size of these roles, further changing his original conception.Shepherd, p. xx"]}, {"page": "Topsy-Turvy", "response": ["* Martin Savage as George Grossmith, who plays Ko-Ko", "While the film deals primarily with the production of The Mikado, it depicts many aspects of 1880s British life and society, some based on historical episodes. Scenes show George Grossmith's use of morphine; Leonora Braham's alcoholism and single motherhood; Jessie Bond's health issues, including an abscess on her leg that does not heal; Sullivan's visit to a French brothel and his relationship with his longtime mistress, Fanny Ronalds, implying that she obtains an abortion; three actors' discussion of the destruction of the British garrison at Khartoum by the Mahdi; a private salon concert; a conversation about the use of nicotine by women; and Gilbert being accosted outside the theatre on opening night by an elderly prostitute. The film also depicts the Savoy Theatre as having electric lighting; it was the first public building in Britain, and one of the first of any kind, to be lit entirely by electricity.\"The Savoy Theatre\", The Times, 3 October 1881; and Burgess, Michael. \"Richard D'Oyly Carte\", The Savoyard, January 1975, pp. 7\u201311 Another scene shows an early use of the telephone. During costume fittings, the actors protest at having to perform without their corsets for the sake of accuracy.An anachronism occurs in the film when Gilbert suggests to Sullivan that he \"get in touch with Mr Ibsen in Oslo\". At the time the capital of Norway was called Christiana; it was not renamed Oslo until 1925."]}]}}
