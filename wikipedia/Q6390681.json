Pugsley moved his HQ to  where he was joined by Brigadier Leicester. Eleven heavy batteries at Westkapelle were known to be still operational. Further heavy bomber raids were planned for an hour before H-hour, which had been set at 9.45 a.m., although these failed to materialise. The fighter-bomber air support to be supplied by the RAF was also cancelled because of fog in Kent, although as the force went in, rocket-firing Typhoons were called in by the RAF liaison officer aboard Kingsmill, and these succeeded in hitting a number of the German batteries. Pugsley had made the decision to proceed with the landings despite the very heavy fire to which the force was being subjected, and he ordered in the operation\u2019s naval Support Squadron, in order to draw the fire of the defending batteries from the landing craft making the primary assault.  Part of the naval Support Squadron of 27 small craft, under Commander Kenneth Sellar and Lieutenant-Commander Leefe, accordingly closed to engage the German shore-based batteries. This they did with conspicuous gallantry, and with very heavy casualties."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Kenneth Sellar (1935) : K. A.
