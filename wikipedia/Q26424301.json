The 1790 British general election there was riotous, marked by mob violence that led to the destruction of Lonsdale's townhouse. Knubley and James Clarke Satterthwaite, the Lonsdale candidates, were returned with 503 votes each, over the incumbent John Christian Curwen and fellow independent Wilson Braddyll with 399 and 394. Curwen, Braddyll, and some of the freemen bore the expense of an election petition against the result. The result was a determination, on 3 March 1791, that the franchise in Carlisle was limited to freemen admitted to the city's guilds, and free either as sons of freemen or having served out an apprenticeship to a freeman. This disenfranchised the honorary freemen created at Lonsdale's direction, and Knubley and Satterthwaite were unseated in favor of their rivals. By this time, Knubley had married his second wife, Sarah Borradaile, by whom he had three sons and a daughter."]}, {"page": "Lord Lonsdale's ninepins", "response": ["*James Clarke Satterthwaite: returned for Cockermouth in 1784.
