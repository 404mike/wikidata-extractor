He was born in Linby, Nottinghamshire and died in Oadby, Leicestershire. He appeared in 175 first-class matches as a righthanded batsman who bowled leg break and googly. He scored 3,645 runs with a highest score of 150 among two centuries and took 335 wickets with a best performance of eight for 122.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Nottinghamshire, captained for the first time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946.Playfair, pp. 102\u2013103. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches."]}, {"page": "Alan Armitage", "response": ["Armitage made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire against Warwickshire in the 1950 County Championship.  He played a further match that season against Hampshire.  In 1951, he made a single first-class appearance for his home county against Oxford University, where incidentally he himself was also studying.  In that same season he made two first-class appearances for the university, against the Free Foresters and Leicestershire.  In the match against the Free Foresters he scored his only first-class century, making 155 runs in the university's first-innings, while in their second-innings he followed this up with an unbeaten 57.  Two appearances in July in the 1951 County Championship against Somerset and Yorkshire were to be his final first-class appearances.  Playing against Yorkshire, he was part of a Fred Trueman hat-trick, with the then future England Test cricketer taking the wickets of Reg Simpson, Armitage and Peter Harvey.  Overall, Armitage scored 348 runs in first-class cricket, which came at an average of 34.80."]}, {"page": "Peter Harvey (disambiguation)", "response": ["Peter Harvey (1944\u20132013) was an Australian journalist and broadcaster.", "Peter Harvey may also refer to:", "* Peter Harvey (writer) (1798\u20131877), American merchant and author", "* Peter Harvey (cricketer, born 1926) (1926\u20131966), English cricketer", "* Peter Harvey (cricketer, born 1923) (1923\u20132006), English cricketer", "* Peter Harvey (baritone) (born 1958), English baritone", "* Peter Harvey (academic) (born 1951), writer and academic scholar on Buddhism"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Peter Harvey (1951) : P.
