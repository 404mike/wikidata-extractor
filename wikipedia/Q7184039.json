John Lucarotti's The Massacre (1987) completely changed the plot of the source serial, The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve. Some guide books (notably 1999's A Critical Guide to Doctor Who on Television by Kenneth Muir) describe the plot of the novel rather than the original serial due to the fact the original serial is one of the many that were lost. Also, when Target launched the novelisation line, there was no inkling that ultimately more than 150 of the show's storylines would be adapted; as a result, there are numerous continuity gaps between early Target books and the scripts and/or later published novelisations; one example is Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon (based upon Colony in Space) which as written depicts Jo Grant's first adventure with the Doctor, even though the television series introduced her several serials earlier in Terror of the Autons (which was novelised at a later date and ignored the discrepancy). Authors sometimes added epilogues to their novelisations which were at odds with other material: The Curse of Fenric by Ian Briggs suggested a fate for Ace that differed from later original novels, and Philip Martin's adaptation of the Mindwarp segment of The Trial of a Time Lord included an ending that completely contradicted the scripted ending of the televised serial.", "In 1989, Target launched another short-lived series of \"original\" novels, this time titled The Missing Episodes and based upon serials commissioned for but never produced for the cancelled 1985-1986 season.

She was pleased with Philip Martin's \"powerful\" Mindwarp storyline involving a mind transplant and a bald head sequence. She was displeased, however, with the retcon at the end of the season which suggested that Peri had married King Yrcanos, played by Brian Blessed, despite her and Blessed having not played any romantic interaction between the two characters. She feels that the explanation of what happened to Peri, in the Big Finish audio story Peri and the Piscon Paradox (2011), fixed this plot hole and should be considered canon.", "The epilogue to the Target Books novelisation of Mindwarp, written by Philip Martin, stated that Peri returned to the 20th Century with King Yrcanos where the latter became a professional wrestler.
