See Joseph Grasset, The marvels beyond science (New York; Funk & Wagnalls company, 1910).) which, he claimed, could detect the \"nervous force\" emitted by the body, and about which he wrote several papers.Joire, Paul. Modifications in the nervous force externalised, according to the state of health of the subjects. The Annals of Psychical Science, no. 4, Oct 1905 (Kessinger Publishing, 2004 - Laura I. Finch [Ed.], p. 219). The device consisted of a circular dial, marked off in degrees, in the centre of which was a delicate needle, balanced on a pivot and the whole covered by a glass case (see illustration). It was found that when the extended fingers of a subject's hand were placed near the side of the device, a deflection of the needle was observed, attributable, according to Joire, to the \"nervous force\" emanating from the body. He thought that this force was modified and disturbed by states of illness in the subject and therefore the sthenometer could be useful in diagnosis and treatment.Joire, Psychical and supernormal phenomena, 1916, pp. 416-418. The nervous force was disputed by other researchers. In 1907, F. J. M. Stratton tested the device and concluded the results were due to the influence of the hands body heat.Stratton F. J. M; Phillips, P. (1906). Some Experiments with the Sthenometer. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 12: 335-339.\"Some Experiments with the Sthenometer: Evaluating Dr Joire\u2019s Results\".
