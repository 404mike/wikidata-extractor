The BBC's television channels adopted special reports on the Duke's life. On BBC News, presenter Martine Croxall interrupted the rolling reports to announce the Duke's death. The channel then briefly cut to images of the Duke to allow her to remove her necklace and put on a black cardigan; all BBC channels then assumed the BBC News feed for the report, although BBC Two was already simulcasting the BBC News channel at the time of the announcement."]}]}}
