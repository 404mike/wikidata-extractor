He was at various times a member of the bands Sounds Incorporated, May Blitz, Three Man Army, T. Rex, and Boxer. He has  performed with Jeff Beck, David Bowie, George Harrison, Robert Palmer, Eric Clapton, Donovan, Mick Ronson, Gene Vincent, Crystal Gayle, the Everly Brothers and others. In 1965, Newman played with Sounds Incorporated as one of the acts opening for the Beatles at Shea Stadium in New York.He played on Donovan's \"Barabajagal\" (1968), as well as on Jeff Beck's Beck-Ola (1969). For David Bowie, he performed on the Diamond Dogs album in 1974, and live with Bowie on his subsequent North American tour, including a recording at the Tower Theater released as David Live. Newman was one of the featured drummers on the soundtrack to the film version of The Who's Tommy.\nIn 1977, he played with Dino Dines, and Herbie Flowers on Marc Bolan's Marc television series.\nHis son, Richard Newman, is also a drummer who has performed regularly with Sam Brown and Deborah Bonham among others, and has also played drums for Jefferson Starship on several UK tours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeff Beck", "response": ["The group produced two albums for Columbia Records (Epic in the United States): Truth (as Jeff BecK, August 1968) and Beck-Ola (July 1969). Truth, released five months before the first Led Zeppelin album, features \"You Shook Me\", a song written by Willie Dixon and first recorded by Muddy Waters, also covered on the Led Zeppelin debut with a similar arrangement.  It sold well (reaching No. 15 on the Billboard charts). Beck-Ola saw drummer Micky Waller replaced by Tony Newman, and, while well-received, was less successful both commercially and critically. Resentment, coupled with touring incidents, led the group to dissolve in July 1969."]}, {"page": "The Hollies", "response": ["In mid-February 1967, Bobby Elliott collapsed on stage due to an inflamed appendix. The Hollies were forced to continue their touring commitments without him, using Tony Mansfield, Dougie Wright and Tony Newman as stand-ins for further live dates, and Wright, Mitch Mitchell and Clem Cattini when they began recording for their next album, Evolution, which was released on 1 June 1967, the same day as the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was also their first album for their new US label Epic, and reached No. 13 in the UK and No. 43 in the US. The US version included the single \"Carrie Anne\". In addition, The Searchers and Paul & Barry Ryan each had a minor UK chart hit covering the Evolution song \"Have You Ever Loved Somebody\" in 1967."]}, {"page": "The Jeff Beck Group", "response": ["They embarked on their third tour in December 1968 with Hopkins who, although in poor health, decided he wanted to play live. He accepted Beck's invitation, even though he had been offered more money by Led Zeppelin. Later, he lamented that \"We lost one of the greatest bands in Rock history.\" Even with his best intentions, the last leg of the tour was curtailed by illness. Beck then postponed a fourth, February 1969 US tour. This was also because he felt they shouldn't keep playing the same material with nothing new to add to it. New material was written, Waller was replaced by power drummer Tony Newman and Wood was dismissed, only to be re-hired almost immediately. The success of Truth ignited new interest from Most and they recorded an album: Beck-Ola at De Lane Lea Studios, engineered by Martin Birch. They released the single \"Plynth\" and laid down three Donovan backing tracks as a favour to Most. Two of them were used for his single \"Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\".", "  bar:Tony    text:Tony Newman "]}, {"page": "Diamond Dogs", "response": ["Buckley writes the album was the first time Bowie used a recording studio as an instrument. With Scott's departure, Bowie produced the album himself. Keith Harwood, who had worked previously with the Rolling Stones on numerous sessions, and on Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, handled engineering duties. Pegg writes that despite Bowie and Harwood's previous collaborations on Mott the Hoople's All the Young Dudes and the original version of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" (both 1972), Diamond Dogs was Harwood's first credit on a Bowie album. Bowie described being \"in awe\" of Harwood because of his work with the Stones. With the departure of the Spiders from Mars, Bowie handled lead guitar duties. He recalled in 1997 that he practiced every day knowing \"the guitar playing had to be more than okay\". This surprised NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, producing what they described as a \"scratchy, raucous, semi-amateurish sound that gave the album much of its characteristic flavour\". Pianist Mike Garson and drummer Aynsley Dunbar returned from the Pin Ups sessions, Tony Newman also played drums while Herbie Flowers, who had played previously on Space Oddity (1969), was recruited to play bass. Alan Parker of Blue Mink played guest guitar on \"1984\" and \"augmented\" Bowie's riff on \"Rebel Rebel\", although he was only credited for \"1984\". Bowie's longtime friend Geoff MacCormack, now known as Warren Peace, sang backing vocals. Diamond Dogs was a milestone in Bowie's career as it reunited him with Tony Visconti, who provided string arrangements and helped mix the album at his studio in London. Visconti would go on to co-produce much of Bowie's work for the rest of the decade.", "*Tony Newman\u00a0\u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Young Americans", "response": ["For the backing band, Bowie wanted to hire MFSB (an acronym for \"Mother Father Sister Brother\"), a rhythm group of over 30 session musicians that resided at Sigma Sound. With the exception of percussionist Larry Washington, all members were unavailable, so Bowie traveled to New York City for further recruitment. Pianist Mike Garson, saxophonist David Sanborn and percussionist Pablo Rosario were retained from the Diamond Dogs Tour, while guitarist Earl Slick was replaced by Alomar. At Alomar's suggestion, Bowie hired former drummer of Sly and the Family Stone, Andy Newmark to replace Tony Newman and bassist Willie Weeks of the Isley Brothers to replace Herbie Flowers. When Bowie informed Visconti in London of Weeks' involvement, Visconti left for New York immediately, explaining: \"I'm a bass player myself, and [Weeks] was my idol\". Ava Cherry, Alomar's wife Robin Clark and then-unknown singer Luther Vandross performed backing vocals for the sessions."]}, {"page": "Barabajagal", "response": ["In May 1969, Mickie Most produced at least one session with Donovan fronting the Jeff Beck Group. \"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" (also known as \"Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" and simply \"Barabajagal\") and \"Trudi\" (originally \"Bed with Me\") resulted from these sessions.
