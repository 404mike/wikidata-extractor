This envisaged a new approach to delivery featuring clear targets and personal responsibility. Without any statutory change, the managerial functions of Ministries would be hived off into Executive Agencies, with clear Framework Documents setting out their objectives, and whose chief executives would be made accountable directly (in some cases to Parliament) for performance. Agencies were to, as far as possible, take a commercial approach to their tasks. However, the Government conceded that agency staff would remain civil servants, which diluted the radicalism of the reform. The approach seems somewhat similar to the Swedish model, though no influence from Sweden has ever been acknowledged."]}, {"page": "Lloyds Bank", "response": ["# Sir Robin Ibbs (1993\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "Executive agencies of the Scottish Government", "response": ["Executive agencies were first established following Sir Robin Ibbs' (then head of the Efficiency Unit) \"Next Steps\" Report in 1988.
