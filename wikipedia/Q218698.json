In his twenties he was able to publish some work, and success followed. He married in 1888, and the honeymoon was spent on a boat on the Thames; he published Three Men in a Boat soon afterwards. He continued to write fiction, nonfiction and plays over the next few decades, though never with the same level of success.\nHe died in 1927 and his body was cremated.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
