John Baillie, writing in the late 18th century, said that they \"live[d] almost entirely upon flesh-meat and flour, of the best kinds, which their strong exertions in their employment require.\" Baillie, An impartial history of the town and county of Newcastle upon Tyne, 1801, p.142 They were known by some as a close-knit group of aggressive, hard-drinking men: John Wesley, after visiting Newcastle, described them as much given to drunkenness and swearing. Baillie said that this reputation was entirely undeserved: the keelmen had a \"rough\" way of expressing themselves, and were loud and vociferous \"from the practice of hailing one another on the river, especially in the night tides\", but \"they scorn to show what they think incivility or rudeness to any person\".Baillie, 1801, p.143  Despite this, in the mid 19th century they were described as \"a proverbially unintelligent, ignorant and intemperate set of men. One keelman, it used to be said, could drink out three pitmen\"."]}]}}
