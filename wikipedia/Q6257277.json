Sir James Galway also pays tribute to him in his autobiography. He inspired more than one generation of British flute players and many of the leading players in British orchestras studied with him or with his pupils. A studio at the Guildhall School of Music is dedicated to his memory and Angeleita Floyd's book about him and his methods, published in 1990, is still available. He was a modest, gentle and dignified man whose only faults were his heavy smoking and his total inability to cook. My mother tolerated the first and compensated splendidly for the second. Her part in his achievement should never be underestimated.Information supplied by John Selwyn Gilbert"]}, {"page": "Zo\u00eb Dominic", "response": ["John Selwyn Gilbert wrote of her: \"I know of no other photographer who got closer to the real spirit of dancers and the dance than Zo\u00eb Dominic.
