Although they had spent over \u00a3350 on work to their ground, they made the decision to instead groundshare with Grays Athletic at the Recreation Ground. Their secretary-manager was Arthur Johnson, a local man who had played in the Football League for Sheffield United. Frank Burton, a former West Ham United and Charlton Athletic player, was recruited as player-trainer, along with goalkeeper Freddy Wood, a teammate at Charlton. Jimmy Pipe of Millwall, Harry White, who had played for Southend United, and Charles Orford of Gillingham, were also signed."]}]}}
