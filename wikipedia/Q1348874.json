During the 1970s, he was the guitarist for the progressive rock band Gentle Giant. Green was with the band from the debut album Gentle Giant all the way to the last album Civilian. Green's style was different from most of his peers, being a more blues-based guitarist. Like his fellow band members, Green was also adept at other instruments, including mandolin and recorder. According to a 2008 interview, founding member Phil Shulman said that, despite Green's blues influences, he fit in well with the band's progressive style since Green was \"quick on the up-take.\"Later on, he was a member of the band Mother Tongue, and also recorded on The Green Album with Eddie Jobson and Zinc, splitting guitar duties with Zinc guitarist Michael Cuneo on two tracks. Green has worked with Billy Sherwood on a number of projects, including Back Against The Wall (2005) and Return to the Dark Side of the Moon (2006). He is now a member of a band called Three Friends with fellow Gentle Giant member Malcolm Mortimore.\nGreen lives in Princeton, Illinois, United States, with his wife, Judy.\nGary Green's brother, Jeff Green, was a roadie for Soft Machine in the early 1970s and later played with Elton Dean.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 20", "response": ["*  1950   \u2013 Gary Green, British musician"]}, {"page": "Princeton, Illinois", "response": ["* Gary Green, guitarist for the band Gentle Giant"]}, {"page": "1950 in music", "response": ["*November 20 \u2013 Gary Green (Gentle Giant)"]}, {"page": "Chris Squire", "response": ["* 2012: Billy Sherwood & The Prog Collective - The Technical Divide (with Alan Parsons & Gary Green)"]}, {"page": "Gentle Giant", "response": ["Gentle Giant was formed in 1970 when the Shulman brothers teamed up with two other multi-instrumentalists, Gary Green (guitar, mandolin, recorder etc.) and Kerry Minnear (keyboards, vibraphone, cello, etc.), plus drummer Martin Smith, who had previously drummed for Simon Dupree and the Big Sound. The classically trained Minnear had recently graduated from the Royal College of Music with a degree in composition, and had played with the band Rust. Green was essentially a blues player and had never worked with a band above the semi-professional level, but adapted readily to the demanding music of the new band. The Shulman brothers, meanwhile, settled into typically multi-instrumental roles of their own - Derek on saxophone and recorder, Ray on bass and violin and Phil on saxophone, trumpet, and clarinet (with all three brothers playing other instruments as and when required).", "Gary Green later recalled \"As I remember it, when Phil announced it at the end of an Italian tour, he said he would leave the band. He couldn't continue on. There was too much stress being on the road and the family. Plus the brothers were having a bit of a difficult time. They're brothers and they argued like hell, sometimes to the point where you thought they were going to hit each other. But I guess it was brotherly love [laughs]. But when Phil said he was going to leave, we were all like stumped, 'Oh! What are we going to do? All right we'll buy a Moog synthesizer!' That's kind of trite; I don't mean it quite like that. We had to do something\".", "Gary Green's opinion of the split differs. In 2003 he commented: \"My own personal opinion is that the band broke up because Derek really wanted a hit album, and I think Ray did too, and they were fed up. They had been musicians longer than I had, and they had tasted it pretty good when they were with Simon Dupree, at least in Britain. And they were looking for some of that in Giant too. My feeling is that we could have continued on as PFM did, or Yes, and still continue. If we had adhered to the statement we started out with, we could still be playing that, and still be earning a reasonable living. That's all water under the bridge and that's fine now. It seemed a bit silly to cut off your creativity for that kind of thing\".", "John Weathers went on to drum for Man (an association that lasted until 1996) and later played in Glenn Cornick's Wild Turkey. Gary Green (having settled in America, near Chicago) went on to play with various Illinois bands (including Blind Dates, the Elvis Brothers, Big Hello, and Mother Tongue) and guest on recordings and at concerts by Eddie Jobson and Divae. Gary also played guitar on the album Deeper Imaginings by Paul Adams and Australian Elizabeth Geyer that was nominated best New Age album of 2019 by the Independent Music Awards.  Kerry Minnear returned to the UK and settled in Cornwall, spending many years working in gospel music. He now runs Alucard Music, the organization supervising the legal and royalty issues regarding Gentle Giant's music.", "The first was a collaboration between four former Gentle Giant members - Kerry Minnear, John Weathers, Gary Green, and Phil Shulman (who only participated as a lyricist).

The band members recorded their parts separately and never reunited in person.", "In 2008, a partial reunion of Gentle Giant involved the creation of a new band called Rentle Giant, in order to play Gentle Giant material.
