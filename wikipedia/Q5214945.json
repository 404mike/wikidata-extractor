Their first vinyl release was a track (\"Three Years Later\") on the Crass Records compilation album Bullshit Detector 2.  They were initially inspired musically by bands as diverse as the Fall, PiL, Wire, and Adam and the Ants and politically by the anarchist stance of Crass.  Another of the band's early releases was under the name \"Skin Disease\", parodying the Oi! bands of the time so successfully that they were included on Back On The Streets, an Oi! compilation EP put together by Sounds magazine journalist Garry Bushell.  By the end of 1982, the band had expanded to include Alice Nutter (of Ow My Hair's on Fire), and Dunstan \"Dunst\" Bruce (of Men in a Suitcase) and were living in a squat in Armley, Leeds on Carr Crofts road, with Harry \"Daz\" Hamer and Mavis \"Mave\" Dillon joining soon after.  Stalwarts of the cassette culture scene, the band released a number of tapes including Be Happy Despite It All and Raising Heck With Chumbawamba, and were featured on many compilations. Chumbawamba were at the forefront of the 1980s anarcho-punk movement, frequently playing benefit gigs in squats and small halls for causes such as animal rights, the anti-war movement, and community groups.
