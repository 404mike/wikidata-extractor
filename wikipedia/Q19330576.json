He teamed up with David O'Hare and they nearly pulled off a shock result against Alexander Bury and former world number one doubles player Max Mirnyi, losing in five sets after having had match points in the fourth. Cluskey then went on to reach the final of a futures event in Nottingham with Liam Broady. In April, Cluskey won his first ever Davis Cup rubber, as Ireland overcame Egypt for a 3-2 victory. Clsukey continued to play with a variety of partners and his form began to improve in late May, having struggled earlier in the year, where he reached the semifinals of Karshi Challenger. He then also reached the semifinals of the Prague Open. In July, partnering Mikhail Kukushkin, he made the cut for his first ever ATP World Tour event - the Swedish Open. They were defeated in their opening match by fourth seeds Brunstr\u00f6m and Monroe. Cluskey then reached the final of the Guzzini Challenger with Lithuanian Laurynas Grigelis but they were defeated in the final set match tie-break. He failed to continue this form in the following week as he lost in the quarter-finals of the Tampere Open with partner Darren Walsh. After back-to-back first-round exits in Segovia and Prague, Cluskey recovered to reach the semi-finals of the Maserati Challenger with Miguel \u00c1ngel Reyes-Varela."]}, {"page": "2013 BRD Bra\u0219ov Challenger \u2013 Doubles", "response": ["#  Ruben Gonzales /  Darren Walsh (Semifinals)"]}, {"page": "Emilio G\u00f3mez (tennis)", "response": ["| Ruben Gonzales Darren Walsh"]}, {"page": "Hugo Nys", "response": ["| Romano Frantzen Darren Walsh"]}, {"page": "2014 ITF Men's Circuit (April\u2013June)", "response": ["|  Adham El-Effendi Darren Walsh7\u20136(7\u20135), 6\u20133||  Sebastian Bader Erik Elliott"]}, {"page": "2014 ITF Men's Circuit (July\u2013September)", "response": ["| 23x15px|border |alt=United States|link=United States Adham El-Effendi23x15px|border |alt=United Kingdom|link=United Kingdom Darren Walsh7\u20136(9\u20137), 6\u20133|| 23x15px|border |alt=France|link=France Olivier Charroin23x15px|border |alt=France|link=France Laurent Rochette", "| 23x15px|border |alt=Netherlands|link=Netherlands Sander Groen23x15px|border |alt=France|link=France Alexandre Sidorenko6\u20133, 6\u20132|| 23x15px|border |alt=Netherlands|link=Netherlands Romano Frantzen23x15px|border |alt=United Kingdom|link=United Kingdom Darren Walsh", "|23x15px|border |alt=Netherlands|link=Netherlands Romano Frantzen  23x15px|border |alt=United Kingdom|link=United Kingdom Darren Walsh"]}, {"page": "2014 ITF Men's Circuit (October\u2013December)", "response": ["|  Laurynas Grigelis David Rice6\u20134, 6\u20134||  Sean Thornley Darren Walsh", "|  Patrik Rosenholm Darren Walsh6\u20134, 3\u20136, [10\u20138]||  Ivan Sabanov Matej Sabanov", "|  Ivan Sabanov Matej Sabanov4\u20136, 6\u20133, [10\u20134]||  Sander Arends Darren Walsh"]}]}}
