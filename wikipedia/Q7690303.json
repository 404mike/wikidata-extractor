Davies also used to host the podcast \"It's Up For Grabs Now\", which took a light-hearted look at goings on at the club. On 18 January 2011, he began hosting the new Arsenal Podcast \"The Tuesday Club\" with Ian Stone, Keith Dover, Tayo Popoola and Skint Records founder Damian Harris. Releases of the podcast ceased in August 2018, but returned in April 2020 on a (mostly) weekly basis. His support of Arsenal has been used as a recurring source of humour on QI in various ways, such as by assigning him a buzzer sound of a chant by fans of rival club Manchester United."]}, {"page": "FabricLive.32", "response": ["Category:Tayo Popoola albums"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Christ's Hospital", "response": ["*Tayo Popoola \u2013 Musician and DJ"]}, {"page": "Tayo", "response": ["* Tayo Popoola (born 1981), British musician and DJ"]}, {"page": "Land of Kings", "response": ["Allez Allez, An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump, Ben Westbeech, Chrome Hoof DJs, ColouringIN, Crystal Vision, David E.
