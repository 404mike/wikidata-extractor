One live branch survived but this was killed by an arson attack in 1970.  A replacement tree, grown from one of the Newland Oak's acorns, was planted by Cyril Hart, verderer of the Forest of Dean, on 21 December 1964.  The replacement tree survives and a partly rotten segment of the original trunk was still visible in 2011.  Hart described the tree in 1966 as having taken \"200 years to grow, 200 years to exist, and 200 to die\"."]}, {"page": "Cyril Hart", "response": ["Cyril Hart may refer to:"]}]}}
