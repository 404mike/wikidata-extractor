He worked as a draper's apprentice in Dublin, before migrating to South Australia in 1878. He initially worked for John Martin & Co., but established his own drapery in North Adelaide in 1882, and built a partnership with several stores. Lucas moved to Gawler in 1886, purchasing the business of J. & J. Wilcox, which he operated until 1901; he also maintained stores in Adelaide, Hamley Bridge and Balaklava, only selling the latter in 1918. He was mayor of the Corporate Town of Gawler in 1893 and 1894, served as president of the Gawler Institute, and was involved with the School of Mines, School Board of Advice, and the committee supporting the Barossa Water Scheme.
