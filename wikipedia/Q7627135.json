Thomas had been Hinckley United's manager for 16 years and was granted a testimonial season in 2007\u201308. Assistant manager Carl Heggs was placed in temporary charge and said on several occasions he would love the job on a permanent basis. On 15 November Heggs was offered the job on a permanent basis until the end of the 2012\u201313 season in a board meeting, but on a further reduced budget after the discovery of more debt being placed upon the club. On 28 February 2013, it was announced in the Hinckley Times that Heggs had signed a new contract until the end of the 2013\u20132014 season after being given the assurances he was looking for from the board. However, on 21 May 2013, Carl decided to resign as manager after being offered the chance to become a PE teacher at Ascot College, Derbyshire. The job was offered to long-serving first team coach, Stuart Storer, who accepted the offer on 27 May. Stuart Storer's first move as boss was to appoint former Knitters' defender Andrew Penny as his assistant, having formally worked as reserve team manager at Chasetown since 2011.", "|  Stuart Storer"]}, {"page": "Wayne Clarke (footballer)", "response": ["Clarke scored 19 goals in his first season at Birmingham, which made him their leading scorer. His 17 league goals made a major contribution to the club winning promotion from the Second Division in 1984\u201385. His season in the top flight with Birmingham was interrupted by suspension and minor injuries, and he only managed five goals as the side were relegated, which included scoring twice in Birmingham's 3\u20130 win in the local derby away to Aston Villa. In 1986\u201387, Clarke again scored 19 goals, which again made him leading scorer. With Birmingham struggling to avoid further relegation to the Third Division and in financial difficulties, the club accepted an offer from Everton who were in need of an emergency replacement for the injured Graeme Sharp. Clarke joined Everton in March 1987 together with inexperienced reserve striker Stuart Storer, the pair jointly valued at \u00a3300,000. Former club Wolves complained to the Football League because they believed Birmingham were deliberately inflating the valuation placed on Storer to reduce the amount they would owe Wolves under the sell-on clause for Clarke. Birmingham's actions may have been an attempt to recoup money lost on the 1981 sale of Joe Gallagher to Wolves, when the club was declared bankrupt the following year still owing most of the \u00a3350,000 fee."]}, {"page": "Asa Charlton", "response": ["In June 2013, it was announced that Charlton had joined Hinckley United ahead of the 2013\u201314 Southern Football League season, under the new management of Stuart Storer and Andy Penny."]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Stuart Storer"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|Thomas (2), Stuart Storer"]}, {"page": "1989 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["|  || || Stuart Storer || "]}, {"page": "2009 HKFC International Soccer Sevens", "response": ["* Hood All Stars: Dale Belford, Mel Hood, David Brightwell, Ian Brightwell, Richard Sneekes, Ally Mauchlen, Dave Regis, Lee Glover, Clive Walker, Stuart Storer (Manager: Mel Hood)"]}, {"page": "List of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players", "response": ["Stuart Tuck, Jeff Minton, Gary Hobson, Stuart Storer, Kerry Mayo and Ross Johnson played, and Nicky Rust was an unused substitute, in the match against Hereford United in May 1997 that maintained Albion's Football League status at their opponents' expense.
