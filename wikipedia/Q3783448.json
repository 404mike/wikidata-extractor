On the foundation of Opera magazine in London in 1950, Rosenthal was assistant editor, and became editor in 1953, retaining the post until 1986.\nHe was a continual campaigner on behalf of opera, and was a strong opponent of its \u00e9litist image and inflated seat prices.

This constant revision reflected the fact that the book, with all its shortcomings, was the best encyclopedic account of operas from Gluck to Mascagni in existence. It was therefore this work which was chosen by the distinguished operatic patron the Earl of Harewood to form the basis of his complete new revision, retaining Kobb\u00e9's plan and a good deal of his text, but bringing the whole work up to date under the title of Kobb\u00e9's Complete Opera Book. Details of specific productions were supplied by Harold Rosenthal. The text was now arranged in three main sections. In Part 1, \"Before 1800\", sections on Monteverdi, Purcell, The Beggar's Opera and Pergolesi were added, Gluck was enlarged, and the Mozart operas systematized. The great body of Kobb\u00e9's work was maintained and enlarged in Part 2, \"The Nineteenth Century\" (beginning with Beethoven), preserved the original format of the various national \"schools\", with specific sections on Wagner and Verdi. Composers and synopses were similarly grouped by nationality in Part 3, \"The Twentieth Century\", treating the period 1900-1950 as a separate coherent whole, including an American section for Thomson, George Gershwin and Gian-Carlo Menotti, and a substantial English section culminating in Benjamin Britten. The illustrations were completely replaced with forty new photographs of post-War operatic productions and singers. Further reprints (with revisions) appeared in 1956 and 1958. The convention of noting authorship of different sections was retained by the initial \"K\" for Kobb\u00e9 and \"H\" for Harewood.
