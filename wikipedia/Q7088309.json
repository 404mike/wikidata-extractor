However, he missed two matches, due to a calf injury he sustained during a 3\u20131 loss against Walsall in the first round of the League Cup, which he captained the side. It wasn't until on 1 September 2018 when Bakayogo made his return from injury, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1\u20131 draw against Northampton Town. He then set up two goals for Harvey Gilmour, who played a huge role, in a 4\u20133 win over Morecambe on 6 October 2018. However, Bakayogo suffered a hamstring injury during the match and was sidelined for a month. It wasn't until on 17 November 2018 when he returned to the first team from injury and set up a goal for Ollie Banks, in a 3\u20132 loss against Crewe Alexandra. Due to strong competition in the club's defence, he was often used in first team ins and out for the side, resulting in him being placed on the substitute bench. However, Bakayogo, once again, faced his own injury concern throughout the 2018\u201319 season and lost his first team place to Liam Ridehalgh. Despite not being involved in the team, the club won promotion to League One after beating Newport County 1-0 at Wembley in the 2019 League Two play-off final, following a 6th-place finish in League Two. At the end of the 2018\u201319 season, making twenty\u2013five appearances, Bakayogo was released by the club."]}, {"page": "Jose Baxter", "response": ["On 30 May 2018, Baxter returned to Oldham Athletic five years after leaving the club; he signed a one-year contract with an option of a further year and was given the squad number 8, previously worn by Ollie Banks.

On 31 January 2014, his contract with Notts County was terminated by mutual consent, and he signed a contract until the end of the season with Torquay United. Just three weeks into his contract, The FA announced that it was investigating an alleged biting incident in the Football League Two game against Chesterfield on 15 February 2014. A number of Chesterfield players claimed they were bitten by a then unnamed player during the game. On 4 March, the FA announced that Labadie had been charged with misconduct for an incident in the 49th minute of the game. Three days later Torquay and their manager, Chris Hargreaves, announced they were contesting the charge. On 12 March, The FA announced that a commission had found Labadie guilty of biting Ollie Banks. It banned Labadie for ten games and fined him \u00a32,000 for the incident. The ban mirrored punishment given to Luis Su\u00e1rez for a similar incident in April 2013. The day before the charges were announced, Labadie scored in a 2\u20131 win over Rochdale. The ban took him through to the end of the season when manager Hargreaves told the press that it was unlikely that Labadie would be offered a new contract after the club's relegation to non-league."]}, {"page": "1992 in England", "response": ["* 21 September - Ollie Banks, footballer "]}, {"page": "Oliver Banks", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ollie Banks"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["|Ollie Banks"]}, {"page": "Marc Klok", "response": ["On 13 July 2016, Klok signed an initial six-month contract with League One side Oldham Athletic.
