He won the World Championship on several occasions.\nCook beat John Roberts Jr., son of the dominant player of the time, John Roberts Sr., in a match in 1869, and then challenged Roberts Sr. for the title. As this was the first actual match for the World Championship, the players themselves drew up a special set of rules for the game. Cook was an expert at the spot stroke, whereas Roberts was superior in the all-around game. Roberts managed to get the pocket width reduced to 3\u2013inches (from the original 35\u20448\u2013in), and the \"D\" and spots were adjusted so that Cook's spot stroke strength, derived from his proficiency at consecutively potting the red ball from its spot was weakened. Cook was nonetheless considered the favourite, and the 20-year-old had improved much from his win over Roberts Jr. the previous year. At 1:38 a.m. on the morning of 12 February 1870, Cook defeated Roberts 1,200-1,083 to win the title, and won a newly created trophy, \u00a3100 and a Maltese cross. The Prince of Wales attended the match at St. James's Hall. This match ended the dominance of Roberts Sr., as the wave of new players took over the game.Roberts Sr. then retired, but Cook was to meet his match in the son, John Roberts Jr., who beat him 1,200-552 in a challenge match for the Championship in April 1870. Cook struggled to match Roberts in the matches, but after improving he was able to hold the championship until 1875. He was then beaten again by Roberts, who would go on to dominate billiards for the next thirty years.Cook popularised the \"spot-barred\" version of English billiards, whereby the red could not be potted more than twice in succession from its spot. This helped to relieve monotonous play in billiards, and encourage spectators to watch the sport.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Cook", "response": ["* William Cook (footballer) (born 1907), English footballer who played for Darlington and Gateshead", "* William Cook (billiards player), World Champion of English billiards in the 19th century", "* William Cook (Lancashire cricketer) (1881\u20131947), English cricketer", "* William Cook (Surrey cricketer) (1891\u20131969), English cricketer", "* William Cook (Leeds/Bradford MCCU cricketer) (born 1995), English cricketer", "* William Cook (MP), member of parliament for Lewes", "* William Cook (British industrialist) (1834\u20131908), British industrialist and politician", "* Sir William Cook, 2nd Baronet (1630\u20131708), member of parliament", "* Antony Tudor (William Cook, 1908\u20131987), English choreographer", "* William Cook (computer scientist) (1963\u20132021), American computer scientist", "* William Cook, nineteenth and early-twentieth century creator of the Orpington poultry breeds", "* William Cook (entrepreneur) (1931\u20132011), American medical equipment manufacturer", "* William Cook (pioneer) (18th century), founder of Russellville, Kentucky", "* William Cook (1908\u20131987), English choreographer, better known as Antony Tudor", "* William Cooke (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Tom Reece", "response": ["In a cradle cannon sequence, the two  are played into a position near a  where the  can be successively played for a  off them so that they remain in the same position at the conclusion for the next shot.
