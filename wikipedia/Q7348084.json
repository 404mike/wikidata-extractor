One of Nelson's final signings as a League club, Nuttall made his debut at left-half in the 2\u20135 defeat to York City on 21 March 1931. He played as a centre forward in the team's following match, a 0\u20133 defeat away at Rotherham United. After two games out of the side, he returned for the 1\u20133 defeat against Wigan Borough. Nuttall made his final Football League appearance on the penultimate match of the 1930\u201331 season, the 1\u20135 loss to Wrexham on 25 April 1931. At the end of the campaign, Nelson failed their re-election to the League and subsequently joined the Lancashire Combination.Nuttall was one of the few players who remained at Seedhill following the descent into non-league football, staying with Nelson until November 1933.
