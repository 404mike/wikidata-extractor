An all-rounder, he was a right-handed opening batsman and Right-arm orthodox spin bowler. He played for Worcestershire, captaining the side in 1946, and also captained Oxford University and Rhodesia. In all he scored 4,700 runs and took 240 wickets in first-class cricket.\nBorn in Repton, Derbyshire, Singleton attended Shrewsbury School, captaining the school cricket team. He then went to Oxford, and won a blue three times. In 1934 he claimed what was to remain his career-best innings return of 6\u201344 against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI at Reigate. He also made his Worcestershire debut in 1934, playing for both county and university for several seasons, and in the last of these (1937) he captained the university side and was selected by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to tour Canada.\nHe then played for Worcestershire (as an amateur) and while teaching at Repton School. Singleton later recalled that in Worcestershire's match against the Australians in 1938 he just failed to hold on to a catch at leg slip that would have dismissed Bradman for nought: in the event he went on to score 258!\nIn Worcestershire's final game before the outbreak of war, Singleton made the first of his four centuries, hitting an unbeaten 102 against Nottinghamshire, and when county cricket resumed in 1946, Singleton was made captain of Worcestershire, and enjoyed the most productive summer of his career: he scored 1,773 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 34.09, as well as taking 43 wickets at 28.23. He made three centuries and ten half centuries, his best being 164 in a nine-wicket victory over Warwickshire in late June.\nWhilst serving with the Royal Air Force in Rhodesia during the war, Singleton had met his wife Polly; they married in 1941 and had five children: three sons and two daughters. After the end of the 1946 English season they emigrated to Rhodesia permanently, and although he concentrated on farming, he played nine times for the Rhodesian side between 1946\u201347 and 1949\u201350, once again being appointed as captain.\nAfter he had retired from playing, Singleton spent nearly twenty years (1964\u20131983) teaching at Peterhouse Boys' School in Marondera, and in 1985 he and his wife emigrated again, this time to Australia where they settled in Wagga Wagga. Singleton was not a fan of modern one-day cricket \u2013 what he called \"the pyjama game\" - and believed that it had had an adverse effect on Test cricket itself. He continued to follow cricket via television until he was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, and died in Wagga Wagga at the age of 84.\nSingleton also played league football.  His brother Michael played three times for Worcestershire in 1946.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Singleton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sandy Singleton"]}, {"page": "Mandy Mitchell-Innes", "response": ["In 1937, Mitchell-Innes was replaced as captain of Oxford by Sandy Singleton, and missed the start of the cricket season as he was busy studying. He did not play his first match until the middle of June, when he scored 137 and 66 not out against Leicestershire; his first innings total being described as \"by far the best seen at Oxford this year.\" Later in the month, he scored another century to help Oxford chase 347 runs in the fourth innings of the match to beat Sussex. In the lead up to the University match, Mitchell-Innes was \"regarded as the outstanding batsman of the two sides\" by The Times, but he did not bat well in the first innings, and was out for 19 runs. In the second innings, he fared a little better, scoring 29 runs to help Oxford to a seven wicket victory; their only win in the University match during Mitchell-Innes' time at Oxford. He topped the batting averages for Oxford once again, scoring his 630 runs at an average of 57.27.Bolton (1962), pp. 292\u2013295.

The team lacked batting strength and did well to improve their championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder Dick Howorth who was, as in 1946, the first player to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with Peter Jackson who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player Roly Jenkins made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman Reg Perks took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper Hugo Yarnold who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, Eddie Cooper and, in his first full season, Don Kenyon all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were Charles Palmer and the veteran Bob Wyatt and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. Laddie Outschoorn qualified for the championship for the first time and showed promise. Other players included Ronald Bird, Fred Cooper (brother of Eddie), Norman Whiting and Martin Young.Playfair, pp. 94\u201395."]}, {"page": "Roger Kimpton", "response": ["In his second match, Kimpton made what was to remain his career best innings when he hit 160 versus Gloucestershire; these runs were hit in 155 minutes, and included a whirlwind hour in which he added 138 with Sandy Singleton."]}, {"page": "Singleton (surname)", "response": ["* Sandy Singleton (1914\u20131999), English cricketer "]}, {"page": "Dennis Stokes", "response": ["Stokes made his debut for Berkshire in the 1928 Minor Counties Championship against Wiltshire.  Nearly a decade later in 1927 he made his first-class debut for the Minor Counties against Oxford University.

He played a second first-class match for the Minor Counties the following season against the same opposition.  In this match, he scored a single run in the Minor Counties first-innings, before being dismissed by Michael Magill, while in their second-innings the same bowler dismissed him for 7.  Stokes had been made Berkshire captain in 1937, a position he retained after World War II and held until 1954, when he seemingly played his final match for Berkshire against Buckinghamshire in the Minor Counties Championship.  However, twelve years later he returned to play a single match in the 1966 Minor Counties Championship against Dorset.  He made a total of 154 appearances for the county in that competition and scored a total of 5,365 runs.
