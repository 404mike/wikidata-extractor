Four minutes in, Julian Alsop headed Anthony Griffin's cross goal-bound and despite the ball being blocked by Andy Tillson, Alsop tapped it into the net to put Cheltenham back into the lead.  Alsop then missed a chance when he headed wide, before Cheltenham saw claims for a penalty denied after it appeared that Stuart Gray had handled the ball in the Rushden penalty area.  In the 69th minute, Rushden made two substitutions, with Jon Brady and Brett Angell coming on to replace Gray and Partridge.  Devaney was then substituted with an injury in the 75th minute and replaced by Neil Grayson.  Five minutes later, his curling shot struck the Rushden goalpost but John Finnigan scored from the rebound.
