In his spell at Anfield he was unable to displace the long-serving Jimmy McDougall from his preferred position, making only 19 appearances across five seasons. He moved to Gillingham, but before playing for them his career was interrupted by the onset of World War II, during which he appeared for Dumbarton, Albion Rovers and Cowdenbeath, staying with the Fife club after the conflict ended.\nHis father of the same name was also a footballer, winning Scottish league titles with Celtic and also appearing for Dumbarton.", "link_mentions": {}}}
