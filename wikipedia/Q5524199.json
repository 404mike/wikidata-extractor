Ross, Lillian and Helen. The Player: A Profile of An Art. New York, NY 1966.  Scofield told his biographer, Garry O'Connor, that his upbringing was divided.

He added, \"A lack of direction in spiritual matters is still with me.\"O'Connor (2002), p. 21.", "Scofield recalls, \"I was a dunce at school.

None could forget Scofield's pathos, the face folded in grief, at, 'When you are desirous to be blessed, I'll blessing beg of you.' We have known many correct, almost formal Hamlet's, aloof from Elsinore.

It does exist only in what you remember and you can't check up on it afterwards and think, 'That's not as good as I remember.' If any performance I've ever given stays in someone's mind that's so much more exciting than being able to put it on the video and play it again. It's not that I don't want to take risks - the opposite is true, in fact. But the more you know about acting, the more you're aware of the pitfalls and the more nerve-racking it becomes. When I was young, I wasn't nervous at all.

According to John Miller's biography, whatever underlying causes there may have been are unknown. An earlier biographer, Garry O'Connor, speculates that Arthur Richardson might have been having an extramarital affair.O'Connor, pp. 20\u201321 There does not seem to have been a religious element, although Arthur was a dedicated Quaker, whose first two sons were brought up in that faith, whereas Lydia was a devout convert to Roman Catholicism, in which she raised Ralph.Miller, pp. 7\u20138 Mother and son had a variety of homes, the first of which was a bungalow converted from two railway carriages in Shoreham-by-Sea on the south coast of England.Morley, Sheridan, \"Richardson, Sir Ralph David (1902\u20131983)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, retrieved 13 January 2014 "]}, {"page": "Garry O'Connor", "response": ["In August 2020, a documentary entitled \"Playing the Game- Garry O'Connor\" aired on BBC Scotland.

Guinness is said to have avoided publicity by giving his name to police and court as \"Herbert Pocket\", the name of the character he played in Great Expectations. However, no record of any arrest has ever been found. Piers Paul Read, in his 2005 biography, suggests \"The rumour is possibly a conflation of stories about Alec's 'cottaging' and the arrest of John Gielgud, in October 1953, in a public lavatory in Chelsea after dining with the Guinnesses at St. Peter's Square.\" This suggestion was not made until April 2001, eight months after his death, when a BBC Showbiz article related that new books claimed that Guinness was bisexual and that he had kept his sexuality private from the public eye and that the biography further said only his closest friends and family members knew he had sexual relationships with men.\"Sir Alec Guinness was bisexual.\" BBC News (Showbiz), 16 April 2001.
