He was tried and executed in London in 1701 for murder and piracy.\nKidd had captured a French ship, commanded by an English captain, as a prize. He had been commissioned by the Crown as a privateer for this expedition, but the political climate of England turned against him in this case. Some modern historians, for example Sir Cornelius Neale Dalton, deem his piratical reputation unjust and say that he was acting as a privateer. Documents found in the early 20th century in London court papers support Kidd's account of his actions.", "link_mentions": {}}}
