He is a midfielder who has played more than 300 games during his professional career, which did not start until he was aged 23. After he was released by Bradford City's youth academy as a youngster he followed a non-league career with Bradford Park Avenue, Farsley Celtic and Stafford Rangers.\nHe became a professional in 1999 with Division Three side Torquay United. Torquay were aiming for promotion during Brandon's first season with the club, but they finished two places outside the Division Three play-offs. He only played two games the following season because of a stomach tear, and upon his return Torquay were instead battling against relegation from The Football League, and Brandon left after three seasons with the club. He moved up a division and played for two years with Chesterfield, where he picked up a number of individual awards but spent two seasons fighting against relegation. In 2004, he joined Huddersfield Town where he twice narrowly missed out on promotion. He had a short spell on loan with Blackpool, helping them to the promotion play-offs. However, after a permanent move failed to materialise he returned to Huddersfield for a fourth season. When he was released by new manager Stan Ternent after four years with the club, he rejoined Bradford City, but had two injury-hit seasons before being released early from his contract. At the start of the following year, he moved to Thailand to join BEC Tero Sasana.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005\u201306 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|7||Chris Brandon||||MF||36 (4)||3||3||1||1 (1)||0||0||0||0 (1)||0||40 (6)||4"]}, {"page": "Martin Worthington", "response": ["He turned professional in July 1999, but made just one further appearance, as a substitute for Chris Brandon in a 3\u20130 win away to Gillingham in the Football League Trophy on 7 December 1999, before being released by Torquay manager Wes Saunders the following February.
