During his career, he was responsible for the economic zoology section of the Natural History Museum, London, vice-principal of the South-Eastern Agricultural College at Wye, Kent, Professor of Agricultural Zoology at London University, and advisory entomologist to the Board of Agriculture for the South-Eastern district of England. He wrote a five volume monograph and sixty scientific papers on mosquitoes. He was recognised for his work in entomology, tropical medicine, and sanitation; awards for his work include the Imperial Ottoman Order of Osmanieh, the Mary Kingsley Medal, and the Victoria Medal of Honour, as well as honorary fellowships of learned societies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anopheles", "response": ["The genus has been subdivided into seven subgenera based primarily on the number and positions of specialized setae on the gonocoxites of the male genitalia. The system of subgenera originated with the work of Christophers, who in 1915 described three subgenera: Anopheles (widely distributed), Myzomyia (later renamed Cellia) (Old World) and Nyssorhynchus (Neotropical). Nyssorhynchus was first described as Lavernia by Frederick Vincent Theobald. Frederick Wallace Edwards in 1932 added the subgenus Stethomyia (Neotropical distribution). Kerteszia was also described by Edwards in 1932, but then recognised as a subgrouping of Nyssorhynchus. It was elevated to subgenus status by Komp in 1937, and it is also found in the Neotropics. Two additional subgenera have since been recognised: Baimaia (Southeast Asia only) by Harbach et al. in 2005 and Lophopodomyia (Neotropical) by Antunes in 1937."]}, {"page": "Toxorhynchites", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederick Vincent Theobald"]}, {"page": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine", "response": ["Recipients of the award include Patrick Manson, David Bruce, Waldemar Haffkine, Bernard Nocht, Hans Vogel, and Frederick Vincent Theobald."]}, {"page": "Theobald", "response": ["*Frederick Vincent Theobald (1868\u20131930), British entomologist"]}, {"page": "Economic entomology", "response": ["It was not until the last quarter of the 19th century that any real advance was made in the study of economic entomology. Among the early writings, besides the book of Curtis, there was a publication by Pohl and Kollar, entitled Insects Injurious to Gardeners, Foresters and Farmers, published in 1837, and Taschenberg's Praktische Insecktenkunde. The article contains a detailed depiction of the damage and treatment as understood at the time. During the 19th century Italian entomologists made significant progress in controlling diseases of the silkworm moth, in the control of agricultural pests and in stored product entomology. Significant figures were: Agostino Bassi ( 1773\u20131856), Camillo R\u00f3ndani (1808\u20131879), Adolfo Targioni Tozzetti (1823\u20131902), Pietro Stefanelli (1835, 1919), Camillo Acqua (1863\u20131936) Antonio Berlese (1863\u20131927), Gustavo Leonardi(1869\u20131918) and Enrico Verson (1845\u20131927). In France Etienne Laurent Joseph Hippolyte Boyer de Fonscolombe, Charles Jean-Baptiste Amyot, \u00c9mile Blanchard, Val\u00e9ry Mayet and Claude Charles Goureau were early workers, as was Jean Victoire Audouin, the author of Histoire des insectes nuisibles \u00e0 la vigne et particuli\u00e8rement de la Pyrale, Philippe Alexandre Jules K\u00fcnckel d'Herculais, Joseph Jean Baptiste G\u00e9hin and Maurice Jean Auguste Girard. American literature began as far back as 1788, when a report on the Hessian fly was issued by Sir Joseph Banks; in 1817 Thomas Say began his writings; while in 1856 Asa Fitch started his report on Noxious Insects of New York. Also in America, Matthew Cooke wrote Treatise on the Insects Injurious to Fruit and Fruit Trees of the State of California, and Remedies Recommended for Their Extermination, published in 1881. The Englishman Frederick Vincent Theobald wrote A textbook of agricultural zoology in 1890. It became a standard text worldwide. Notable foresters were Herman von N\u00f6rdlinger (1818\u20131897) and Julius Theodor Christian Ratzeburg (1801\u20131871)."]}, {"page": "Victoria Medal of Honour", "response": ["**Frederick Vincent Theobald (1868\u20131930)"]}, {"page": "Anopheles walkeri", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederick Vincent Theobald"]}, {"page": "Taxonomy of Anopheles", "response": ["The classification of this genus began in 1901 with Frederick Vincent Theobald.
