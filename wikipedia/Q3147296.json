Player Ron Fenton took caretaker charge, before Frank Blunstone was installed as manager in mid-December.

The team began the season in good form, winning six and drawing one of the first 9 matches to sit atop the Third Division table.

While the club established itself in the promotion places, \u00a329,000 was spent on forwards Billy Cobb and Ian Lawther in October and November 1964.

The win gave way to three defeats and a draw in the following four matches, but consecutive victories over Shrewsbury Town and Swansea Town in mid-September proved to be a false drawn. Brentford would win just one more league match before the end of 1965 and the team's plight was worsened by the departures of influential attackers Jimmy Bloomfield, Mark Lazarus and John Fielding after disputes with manager Tommy Cavanagh.

Hopes of money-raising runs in the FA Cup and League Cup were extinguished with first round defeats in each competition, but chairman Blindell had revealed the positive news in November that the club was more or less breaking even. 9 defeats and just one victory in a 12-match spell between December 1967 and February 1968 undid all the good early-season work and dropped the Bees back into mid-table.
