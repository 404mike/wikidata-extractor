He played in Scotland for Hibernian, before heading south of the border to play for Derby County in The Football League. He played 28 League games for Derby, both as an inside forward and an outside forward, and a further 51 Southern League matches for Bristol Rovers between 1899 and 1901.He took part in Bristol Rovers' biggest ever win, when he played outside-left in a 15\u20131 victory over Weymouth in the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup on 17 November 1900. He scored one of Rovers' goals, but was the only member of the front line to fail to score more than once. Inside-right Jack Jones scored six times in that game, a record for a Bristol Rovers player.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
