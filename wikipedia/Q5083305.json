The edifice occupied the place where now stands St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue.

These troops were split into two divisions: the largest, 3,700 men under Beckwith with subordinate command given to Major General Thomas Hislop, was to be deployed at Le Gosier on the island's southern shore.James, p. 313 The second division, 2,450 men under Brigadier General George Harcourt, was initially ordered to wait on the \u00celes des Saintes before being deployed after the main attack to the rear of the French garrison. A small reserve under Brigadier General Charles Wale would follow the main assault to provide support if required. As the French had no significant naval resources on the island, the Royal Navy's contribution was much smaller than that required for the Martinique invasion the year before. Cochrane attached ships of the line to both divisions, Beckwith sailing in Cochrane's flagship HMS Pompee, accompanied by HMS Abercrombie with Commodore William Charles Fahie, while Harcourt sailed with Commodore Samuel James Ballard in HMS Sceptre. Ballard and Fahie were in command of the transports and smaller vessels that carried the invasion forces and bore responsibility for ensuring that the amphibious landings were successful as well as for any naval units that participated in the land campaign.Clowes, p. 290"]}, {"page": "List of colonial and departmental heads of Martinique", "response": ["|1812 to 1814||Sir Charles Wale, Captain-General||"]}, {"page": "Sir William ffolkes, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["ffolkes was the son of  Martin William Browne ffolkes and his wife Henrietta Bridget Wale, daughter of Sir Charles Wale  of Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire.
