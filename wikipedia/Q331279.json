Many of these come from the Scottish Psalter, and appear here without the doxologies added in CH3.  (These doxologies are included as Hymn 109, but their separation from the texts of the psalms presumably means they will be relatively seldom used.)  But the section also includes psalms from other musical traditions, as well as prose psalms for responsive reading - still not common in the Church of Scotland. The volume then continues, as did CH3, with a thematic arrangement of hymns, this time divided into three main sections each associated with one person of the Holy Trinity and subdivided into aspects of God and the Church's response. There then follows an international section of short songs, including evangelical choruses by writers such as Graham Kendrick and pieces from Taiz\u00e9 and the Iona Community. A final short section contains Amens and Doxologies."]}, {"page": "Terl Bryant", "response": ["Bryant is also known to perform and teach within Christian circles under the banner of 'Voice of Drums.
