He speedily reorganized the school and succeeded in winning the enthusiasm of the students. He became a member of the Society of Artists and sent work to their exhibitions. In 1924 he designed their medal, and in 1927 was responsible for sculpture for the National War Memorial at Adelaide. In the same year he was awarded the Wynne prize at Sydney. His best known works are the figures on the exterior of the ANZAC War Memorial in Hyde Park, Sydney, the central group in the interior, and the bronze reliefs. The figures on the exterior and the interior group, including Sacrifice, are cited by sculptor, Ron Robertson-Swann as \"Sydney's most moving example of publicly visible architecture\". Art historian, Professor Virginia Spate, wrote in 1999: \"Even incomplete, [it] is the most perfect sculptural monument in Australia.\" An example of his sculpture associated with architecture is at the University of Sydney, where four medallion portraits of great scientists are on the fa\u00e7ade of the physics building."]}, {"page": "Orphism (art)", "response": ["* Stangoes, Nikos (ed).
