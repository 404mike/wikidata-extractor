He is known for his performance work with Martin von Haselberg as one of The Kipper Kids who became notorious for their rowdy and rebellious performances in the art world; influencing the punk movement and the inspiration for such acts as Blue Man Group, Karen Finley and Paul McCarthy. The Kipper Kids performed throughout Europe, North Africa, United Kingdom, North America and Canada. They also worked on a number of projects for HBO and Cinemax as well as cameos in various movies.\nIn addition to the Kipper Kids, Brian has performed as a solo act and collaborated with other performers and artists. He produced sound art which consists of video performance and sound works that have been featured in museums, galleries, television and on radio.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Forbidden Zone", "response": ["Actor Herv\u00e9 Villechaize was a former roommate of co-writer and co-star Matthew Bright; Villechaize had previously dated co-star Susan Tyrrell, but the two had already broken up by the time production on the film began. According to Richard Elfman, Tyrrell and Villechaize fought periodically throughout the production. The Elfmans' grandfather, Herman Bernstein, also appeared in the film, and Richard Elfman's accountant appeared under the name \"Hyman Diamond\" because Elfman had no idea whether or not he wanted to be credited. Others who worked on the film include The Kipper Kids (Brian Routh and Martin von Haselberg), Joe Spinell, and former Warhol superstar Viva."]}, {"page": "Karen Finley", "response": ["While Karen Finley was a student at the San Francisco Art Institute, she became immersed in the Bay Area's punk music scene, witnessing the emergence of the bands The Dils and the Dead Kennedys. In 1977, Finley performed in underground art galleries and music clubs such as Mabuhay Gardens and Club Foot, which hosted poetry readings, punk concerts, and alternative performance art acts. Finley's performance Deathcakes and Autism included a dancer, called \"Laurie\", from the Condor Club. The work's narrative juxtaposes the shattering psychological impact of Finley's father's recent suicide with a study of the female nude. Having received an MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute, Finley procured her first NEA grant and moved to New York City. She quickly became part of the city's art scene, collaborating with artists such as The Kipper Kids (Brian Routh \u2014 whom she married/divorced \u2014 and Martin von Haselberg) and David Wojnarowicz."]}, {"page": "The Kipper Kids", "response": ["The Kipper Kids were a duo composed of Martin Rochus Sebastian von Haselberg (born 20 January 1949) and Brian Routh (9 March 1948 \u2013 3 August 2018), two artists known for the extreme and often comedic performance art they made together in the 1970s and after. Von Haselberg lives and works in New York, U.S.; and Routh was living in Leicester, England, at the time of his death from cancer. From 1971, the duo were also known as Harry and Harry Kipper.", "Martin von Haselberg and Brian Routh met in 1970 at East 15 Acting School. After months of improvisation they invented a character they called Harry Kipper and began experimenting with different theatrical formats to use him in. Upon being expelled for being \"too experimental\" they took to the road, touring constantly. When von Haselberg and Routh coined the name Kipper Kids, they were originally called Harry and Alf Kipper and had two distinctly different characters. Because neither could ever remember who was Harry and who was Alf, they dropped the name Alf and decided to call each other Harry. At the same time they decided to make their characters identical. Thus the Kipper Kids as Harry Kipper and Harry Kipper were born in 1971.", "In 1982, they stopped actively collaborating, performing as The Kipper Kids only occasionally until their final performance together at the National Review of Live Art, Glasgow, in 2003. They reunited as The Kipper Kids in 2018 to perform the song \"Mah N\u00e0 Mah N\u00e0\" for the album Dr. Demento: Covered in Punk, months before Brian Routh's death.", "Currently, Martin von Haselberg has created a series of large photographic images made into inflatable sculptural shapes titled Floatulents,The Best of New Orleans, Mnemonic Devices and Floatulents, by D. Eric Bookhardt  and is a painter. In the decade before his death, Brian Routh created sound works that incorporated vocal soundbites from world leaders, politicians, madmen, poets, murderers and others."]}, {"page": "Nina Sobell", "response": ["In the early 1970s, Sobell worked with closed-circuit video to explore the relationship between artist and audience. Sobell was married to performance and  sound artist Brian Routh aka \"Harry Kipper of the Kipper Kids\" between 1975 and 1981, and the couple collaborated on many performance video pieces, including Interactive Electroencephalographic Video Drawings. In 1973, with the series Brainwave Drawing, Sobell set up a system in which two participants could see their brainwaves changing in real time as they simultaneously watched their images on closed-circuit video, creating an improvisational feedback loop as they silently attempted to communicate with each other."]}, {"page": "Routh, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Routh"]}]}}
