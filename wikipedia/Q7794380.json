He is generally regarded as one of the most outstanding players of the 18th century.\nA famous all-rounder, he made his debut in 1775 and played till 1798.  He played mainly for Hampshire but also made a number of appearances for Berkshire at a time when the county had a first-class team.\nIt was said of Taylor (see Haygarth and Nyren in particular) that he was an \"admirable\" cover field and a strong thrower.  As a batsman, he was a great hitter but \"didn\u2019t guard his wicket well enough\" and had a tendency to cut at straight balls \"like Beauclerk later\".  He was also an effective bowler and took many wickets, though we don't know what his pace was.  Nyren commends Taylor on his fielding and says he was one of the best ever seen.\nIn August 1786, Taylor and Tom Walker scored the third and fourth known first-class centuries in the same innings for White Conduit Club v Kent at Bourne Paddock.  Taylor made 117, his highest known career score.\nThomas Taylor made 105 known first-class appearances from 1775 to 1798.\nTaylor was another cricketing innkeeper.  He had the Globe Inn at Alresford.", "link_mentions": {}}}
