He is generally regarded as one of the most outstanding players of the 18th century.\nA famous all-rounder, he made his debut in 1775 and played till 1798.  He played mainly for Hampshire but also made a number of appearances for Berkshire at a time when the county had a first-class team.\nIt was said of Taylor (see Haygarth and Nyren in particular) that he was an \"admirable\" cover field and a strong thrower.  As a batsman, he was a great hitter but \"didn\u2019t guard his wicket well enough\" and had a tendency to cut at straight balls \"like Beauclerk later\".  He was also an effective bowler and took many wickets, though we don't know what his pace was.  Nyren commends Taylor on his fielding and says he was one of the best ever seen.\nIn August 1786, Taylor and Tom Walker scored the third and fourth known first-class centuries in the same innings for White Conduit Club v Kent at Bourne Paddock.  Taylor made 117, his highest known career score.\nThomas Taylor made 105 known first-class appearances from 1775 to 1798.\nTaylor was another cricketing innkeeper.  He had the Globe Inn at Alresford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "White Conduit Club", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" | Tom Walker, known as \"Old Everlasting\", was very close to becoming the first batsman ever to score two centuries in a match. The centuries by Walker and Thomas Taylor are the first instance of two players scoring centuries in the same match, let alone the same innings. Although it cannot be confirmed, it is possible they shared a 200-plus partnership. These were the third and fourth centuries in known important matches, following the previous hundreds by John Small and James Aylward who were both playing in this game."]}, {"page": "Thomas Taylor", "response": ["Thomas Taylor may refer to:", "*Thomas Taylor (Medal of Honor) (born 1834), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*Sir Thomas Taylor, 2nd Baronet (1657\u20131696), English MP for Maidstone", "*Sir Thomas Taylor, 1st Baronet (1662\u20131736), Anglo-Irish MP", "*Sir Thomas Taylor, 2nd Baronet, of Kells (1686\u20131757), Anglo-Irish MP", "*Thomas Taylor (Liberal politician) (1851\u20131916), British Liberal Party politician, MP for Bolton, 1912\u20131916", "*Thomas Taylor (Canadian politician) (1865\u20131947), politician in British Columbia, Canada", "*Thomas Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gryfe (1912\u20132001), British politician", "*Thomas Taylor, Baron Taylor of Blackburn (1929\u20132016), British life peer", "*Thomas Taylor (Australian politician), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "*Thomas Taylor (Archdeacon of Ardagh), 18th-century Anglican priest in Ireland", "*Thomas Taylor (historian) (1858\u20131938), priest, historian and scholar of Celtic culture", "*Thomas Taylor (minister) (1738\u20131816), English Wesleyan minister and writer", "*Thomas Taylor (priest, 1576\u20131632), English Puritan", "*Thomas Taylor (priest, 1757\u20131808), Archdeacon of Chichester", "*Thomas Taylor (cricketer, born 1753) (1753\u20131806), English cricketer", "*Thomas Taylor (cricketer, born 1823), English cricketer", "*Tommy Taylor (Irish footballer), real name Thomas Taylor, Irish international footballer", "*Thomas Taylor (rugby league) (1911\u20131992), rugby league footballer of the 1930s and 1940s for England, Yorkshire, and Castleford", "*Thomas Taylor (weightlifter) (born 1899), British Olympic weightlifter", "*Thomas Taylor (architect) (1777/78\u20131826), English artist and architect", "*Thomas Taylor (Australian architect) (19th century), Brisbane architect, designed the Wenley House", "*Thomas Taylor (artist) (born 1973), British children's author and illustrator", "*Thomas Taylor (botanist) (1786\u20131848), botanical author", "*Sir Thomas Taylor (chemist) (1895\u20131953), English chemist and university administrator", "*Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist) (1758\u20131835), English translator and Neoplatonist"]}, {"page": "George T.
