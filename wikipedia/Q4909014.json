He also played a first-class game for the North of England in 1947, and appeared in the Yorkshire Second XI from 1947 to 1953.\nA right arm fast medium bowler, he took 128 wickets at 27.1 with a best of 6 for 63 against Hampshire County Cricket Club.  He took 5 wickets in an innings 5 times.  A right-handed lower order batsman, he scored 125 runs at 6.25 with a top score of 35.\nHe died on 8 July 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["Before he played in first-class cricket, Boycott played for the successful Barnsley Cricket Club, making his debut in 1959 and becoming a regular team member that year alongside Dickie Bird and Michael Parkinson. In one match against Scarborough, Boycott faced a delivery from Bill Foord which he dispatched to the boundary for four. Foord turned to Parkinson and asked: \"Christ almighty, what's this lad's name?\" Bird remembered his \"application, concentration and absolute belief in himself. He had one great gift, mental strength. You can have all the coaching in the world but the most important thing is to be mentally strong.\"McKinstry, pp. 28-29. Although Bird later left Boycott out of his choice XI, he would write: \"of all the great players I have seen, if I had to pick a batsman to bat for my life, I would go for Geoffrey.\" He made his Yorkshire Second XI debut on 6 July 1959 against Cumberland at Penrith, scoring five and 15.Boycott, p. 47."]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25.", "Yorkshire by contrast had a poor season, though it could partly be excused by the impact of Test calls, injuries and Trueman's national service. They dropped to twelfth place in the County Championship, which was then their lowest-ever position.Webber, p. 87. Ray Illingworth, who had made only a handful of appearances previously, was an ever-present in Yorkshire's championship team in 1953 and other young prospects making progress were Mike Cowan, Doug Padgett, Bryan Stott and Ken Taylor. Otherwise, the mainstays were as before: Yardley, Hutton, Lowson, Lester, Halliday, Watson, Wilson, Sutcliffe, Brennan and Wardle. Close played in only two matches and Trueman in ten. Bill Holdsworth made 14 appearances and Bill Foord, in his last season before finally deciding to be a schoolteacher, made 22."]}, {"page": "Foord", "response": ["*Bill Foord, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Graham School", "response": ["*Bill Foord, cricketer, for Yorkshire"]}, {"page": "William Foord", "response": ["*Bill Foord (1924\u20132015), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Scarborough Cricket Club (England)", "response": ["* Bill Foord"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Bill Foord, 91, cricket player (Yorkshire)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2015", "response": ["*Bill Foord, 91, English cricketer.C.W Foord: Obituary"]}, {"page": "Charles Foord", "response": ["#REDIRECTBill Foord"]}]}}
