He was a left-handed batsman and occasional leg-spin and googly bowler. Subba Row was a member of the powerful Cambridge side of the early 1950s and played a few games for Surrey before joining Northamptonshire. Taking over as captain in 1958, he led the side for four seasons and achieved considerable success as a batsman, scoring the county's highest ever innings, 260 not out, in 1955 and then bettering it with 300 against Surrey, the County Champions, at the Oval in 1958, when he shared a record sixth wicket stand of 376 with Albert Lightfoot."]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Albert Lightfoot"]}, {"page": "Jim Watts", "response": ["Watts made his Northamptonshire debut as an eighteen-year-old in 1959, and reached 1,000 runs in each of his first four seasons, receiving his county cap in 1962.Club History: County Caps  www.northantscricket.com. Retrieved 19 June 2010. He was a significant figure in the 1965 Championship challenge, heading the batting averages with 1,211 runs at 31.05 and picking up 44 wickets. Watts asked to be released in 1966; but he was fit enough to set a new Northants County League record two years later, claiming 10\u201310 for Rushden against Kettering. Twice he took on the captaincy in very difficult circumstances, and twice he left the side in an immeasurably better state than he found it. In the autumn of 1970, Northamptonshire faced the future without the services of Roger Prideaux, Brian Reynolds and Albert Lightfoot, and with Mushtaq Mohammad expected to miss a good part of the following summer on tour with Pakistan. Watts, only back at Wantage Road for a season after three years out of the county game, was the committee's choice to take charge. The 1971 season was the first as captain and marked it with 1,311 runs, and the following August led Northamptonshire to a hugely satisfying seven-wicket victory over Ian Chappell's Australians.  'The better side won'  observed secretary Ken Turner. It was, for Watts,  'the greatest moment since I became captain.'  Northamptonshire finished fourth, third and third again in the Championship before Watts handed over the baton to concentrate on his teaching career. Another highlight before he resigned was the 59-run John Player League triumph over one-day specialists Lancashire in 1974, it was Watts' benefit match and he marked the occasion with 61 runs."]}, {"page": "Harry Kelleher", "response": ["The 1957 season, when Northamptonshire finished as runners-up to Surrey in the County Championship, was the most successful in the county's history, but most of the bowling success was down to Tyson, who took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, and the three slow bowlers, George Tribe, Jack Manning and Michael Allen, who took 305 Championship wickets between them. Kelleher took just 44 wickets in 22 matches and his bowling average, 26.90, contrasted with the county's other bowlers, all of whom averaged less than 20 runs per wicket. In 1958, he played in three early matches, but took only one wicket, and lost his place in the attack to Albert Lightfoot, who supplemented his occasional bowling with useful batting, a skill Kelleher never aspired to. He left Northamptonshire at the end of the 1958 season."]}, {"page": "Lightfoot (surname)", "response": ["* Albert Lightfoot (born 1936), English cricketer"]}]}}
