Bryce stated she would like to see an Australia where: \"people are free to love and marry whom they choose [...] And where perhaps, my friends, one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation's first head of state\". Her comments drew severe criticism, not merely for their support of a republic while still serving as the Queen's representative, but because the role is meant to be strictly non-partisan. Senator Dean Smith called them \"a slap in the face to many, many Australians, and a significant breach of trust\". Amanda Vanstone accused her of possible grandstanding, and wrote: \"In publicly declaring these views, she has brought that high office into a political realm in which it does not belong ... Someone might explain to her that the job is not about her ... it's about us.\" Although the Australian republican movement supported her comments, head of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy David Flint stated that: \"There's this sense of division that she's created and the position is not intended to be divisive\u2014it's intended to unite and be above politics.\" Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported her right to comment, saying \"It's more than appropriate for the Governor-General, approaching the end of her term, to express a personal view on a number of subjects, and that's what she was doing.\""]}, {"page": "Judith Adams", "response": ["The Parliament of Western Australia appointed Dean Smith on 2 May 2012 to Adams' Senate vacancy."]}, {"page": "Marriage Act 1961 (Australia)", "response": ["The bill in question, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, was introduced by Liberal Party Senator Dean Smith on 15 November 2017.

It also removed the ban on overseas same-sex marriages being recognised in Australia, including ones that occurred before the law change.
