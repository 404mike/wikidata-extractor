He did from time to time inflict serious injuries on his opponents: Reg Sinfield of Gloucestershire, Patsy Hendren of Middlesex, and H.B.

His teammate Charlie Barnett said that he did not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.Murphy, p. 103."]}, {"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Reg Sinfield || 1,165"]}, {"page": "Sam Cook (cricketer, born 1921)", "response": ["Born in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, Cook was a small and stocky slow left-arm spinner, who emerged unexpectedly after World War II when Gloucestershire had lost Tom Goddard\u2019s former partner Reg Sinfield. Wally Hammond saw him in the nets during the spring, and took Cook on immediately with great expectations that were amply fulfilled.Profile on CricInfo Cook, who was never known by his given name, took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, and 133 wickets in the 1946 season, when he played in the Test Trial. No great spinner of the ball, Cook relied on accuracy and flight: if he lacked penetration as a bowler, he was also very rarely mastered. In the following year with the Bristol pitch \u2013 which had caused little satisfaction for its tendency to be either a spinners\u2019 (as in 1939) or a batsman's (as in 1946) paradise \u2013 being reconditioned with a sand dressing, Cook offered superb support to Goddard to form to most difficult bowling attack in the country. Cook was called into the England team to play the South Africans on the batsman's pitch at Trent Bridge in 1947, after taking six South African wickets in the second innings of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) match in May. However, in the Test match, he took no wickets for 127 runs, scored 0 and 4, and was never picked again. The Kent fast bowler Jack Martin, who had done equally well in the MCC match, was also picked for the Trent Bridge Test, also fared badly, and was likewise discarded, never to appear in Test cricket again. In 1948, with the Bristol pitch dressed with loam instead of sand, Cook declined considerably and never threatened the superbly-skilled Australian batsmen, and in 1949 he took until August to recapture any sort of form."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Reg Sinfield \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Sinfield", "response": ["* Reg Sinfield (1900\u20131988), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "R.A.

In September of the same year, he was promoted to the rank in full. He played cricket for the United Services in 1935, against a strong Hampshire Club & Ground side, scoring 20 runs and taking four wickets. Manners served aboard the royal yacht Victoria and Albert at Portsmouth in 1936, though with King Edward unwilling to travel to Cowes, this left Manners with more shore time. He played for the Royal Navy as captain against the British Army cricket team in a two-day match at Lord's in July of that year, where he scored 23 and 47, impressing Christopher Heseltine, then president of Hampshire County Cricket Club, who recommended to Manners that he play for the county. He was allowed by the navy to play for Hampshire in August, making his debut in first-class cricket against Gloucestershire at the United Services Ground in the County Championship, scoring 81 runs in his first innings before he was dismissed by Reg Sinfield and thus narrowly falling short of becoming the first Hampshire batsman to make a century on their first-class debut. In the fortnight following this match, he made four further first-class appearances, scoring 212 runs at an average of 35.33. He headed Hampshire's batting averages in 1936 and sufficiently impressed future Test Match Special commentator John Arlott with his strokeplay, with some suggesting he had the technique for Test cricket."]}, {"page": "Monty Cranfield", "response": ["Cranfield first appeared for Gloucestershire in 1934 and played in 17 first-class matches that season, making 305 runs at an average of 16.05 and taking 23 wickets at an average of 37.60. His first five-wicket haul came at Bristol against a Yorkshire team weakened by Test calls; he took five for 58 in the first innings, but scarcely bowled in the second innings as Reg Sinfield and Charles Parker shared the wickets between them. In 1935, Cranfield was awarded his county cap, though his season's figures were poor: 294 runs at an average of just 8.16 and only 10 wickets all season. He did, however, produce his first 50 in first-class cricket: an innings of exactly 50 against Derbyshire at Bristol. The batting got no better across the 1930s, and though Wisden noted in its review of Gloucestershire's 1936 season that \"[Cranfield's] slow leg-breaks were often useful\", the 35 wickets he took in that season were his best return in pre-war cricket. By 1939, he was playing mostly for Gloucestershire's second team in the Minor Counties, though he returned for the game against Cambridge University in June 1939 and took 10 wickets in the match for 88 runs, including a first-innings return of five for 33 which was at that stage his best in first-class cricket. Wisden's report that Cranfield was \"flighting and spinning the ball from the off\" suggests that he was bowling off spin at this stage."]}, {"page": "Joseph Buxton", "response": ["Buxton made a single first-class appearance for Nottinghamshire against Gloucestershire at Trent Bridge in the 1937 County Championship.  Batting first, Nottinghamshire made 396 all out, with Buxton the last man out when he was dismissed by Reg Sinfield for 6 runs.  In response, Gloucestershire were dismissed for 350, with Buxton taking the wicket of Charlie Barnett to finish with figures of 1/54 from eighteen overs.  Nottinghamshire declared their second-innings on 204/4, with Buxton not required to bat.  Gloucestershire reached 107/2 in their second-innings, in which Buxton bowled eleven wicketless overs.
