Shortt first played club cricket in Dublin for Merrion Cricket Club, before leaving to play for Pembroke in 1922. Shortt later made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Ireland against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Dublin in 1934. Batting twice in the match, Shortt was dismissed without scoring in Ireland's first-innings by Denijs Morkel, while in their second-innings he was once again dismissed without scoring, this time by Reginald Butterworth. He bowled 18 wicket-less overs for 44 runs in the MCC first-innings, while in their second-innings he dismissed Morkel, Brian Belle and Erroll Tremlett, finishing with figures of 3/22 from 8 overs. He did not appear for Ireland after this match, but did continue to play club cricket for Pembroke until 1949, after which he joined YMCA. Outside of cricket, he worked as a dentist. He died at Dublin in August 1963, the day after his 65th birthday."]}]}}
