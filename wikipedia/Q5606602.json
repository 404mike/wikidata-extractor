Many responded to inform Gregg Wallace that rendang, which is a spicy stew normally made with chicken or beef of tender texture, doesn't consist of crispy outer skin. Subsequently, viewers took to Facebook and Twitter to comment about the rendang's actual texture and how the judges were at fault for eliminating the contestant, when the actual reason was based on Torode's professionalism of flavour enhancements, not Wallace's inexperience of how the dish should be cooked; hence Wallace's reference to a lack of 'crispy skin'   including former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who posted a picture of the dish on Instagram with the attached caption, \"Who eats \u2018crispy\u2019 chicken rendang?\" Torode responded to the criticism through Twitter by writing: \"Maybe Rendang is Indonesian!
