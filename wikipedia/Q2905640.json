She has also pursued a broadcasting career.\nFollowing her studies at The King's High School For Girls, and Guildhall School of Music and Drama, with Arthur Reckless, she began her career as a member of the English Baroque-jazz crossover group, The Swingle Singers (then called \"Swingle II\"). By 1980 she had begun appearing frequently in the New London Consort and thereafter began performing across the world in Europe, Latin America and the USSR with several other period-instrument groups.She has recorded extensively, for example as Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (with Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music in 1994), with the choir of King's College, Cambridge  conducted by Stephen Cleobury in Bach's St. John Passion, as Venus in John Blow\u2019s Venus and Adonis with Philip Pickett, and in Monteverdi's L'Incoronazione di Poppea with Sir John Eliot Gardiner.  She also vocalized on Trevor Jones's score for The Dark Crystal.Bott has been used by conductors to perform and record more recent repertoire, for example with Sir John Eliot Gardiner in Faur\u00e9's Requiem, Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia Antartica, Nielsen\u2019s Symphony No. 3 with Bryden Thomson and the London Symphony Orchestra and Royal Scottish National Orchestra respectively. She is also in demand among contemporary composers such as Michael Nyman and Jonathan Dove.With Lucie Skeaping, Bott has been one of two presenters of The Early Music Show on BBC Radio 3 and has also presented Radio 3's Live in Concert. In October 2013, Bott joined Classic FM to present a three-year project covering the entire history of classical music.\nShe currently presents a three hour program on Classic FM every Sunday afternoon between 1pm - 4pm. She can also be heard as a presenter for performances on the Wigmore Hall website.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 11", "response": ["*1952 \u2013 Catherine Bott, English soprano"]}, {"page": "Rinaldo (opera)", "response": ["The first full recording of Rinaldo (an \"excerpts\" disc had preceded it by two years) was made in 1977 by CBS, with Carolyn Watkinson in the title role, Ileana Cotruba\u0219 as Almirena, and Jean-Claude Malgoire conducting La Grande \u00c9curie et la Chambre du Roy. The work, recorded in a Paris church, was based on the 1711 score; Alan Blyth in Gramophone praised the standard of the singing, and despite reservations about the sound quality, called it one of the most enjoyable of available Handel opera recordings.  There was no further recording of Rinaldo available until 1990, when John Fisher's heavily cut version from La Fenice was issued. Another decade passed before the appearance of Christopher Hogwood's 1999 Decca recording, again based on the original score, with the countertenor David Daniels as Rinaldo, Cecilia Bartoli as Almirena and Catherine Bott in the small part of First Mermaid. Gramophone's reviewer called this issue \"a treat for Handel lovers \u2013 a rare recording of one of the composer's richest operas, with a strong and starry cast\".  Since then several more versions have been made available: Harry Bicket's 2001 recording for Arthaus, which was later issued as a DVD;  Ren\u00e9 Jacobs with the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra for Harmonia Mundi in 2001;  and a performance by the Aradia Ensemble under Kevin Mallon, recorded in 2004 and issued under the Naxos label in 2005.
