Thomas Wilson White (September 1896 \u2013 1960) was an English professional footballer who played in the Football League for Birmingham and Newport County. He played as a full back.\nWhite was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire. He joined Birmingham in March 1918, and played a few games in the wartime leagues. He made his debut in the Second Division on 26 October 1919, in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to West Ham United, deputising for Billy Ball who had been injured playing for England in a Victory international. White, described as a \"slow, cumbersome defender who relied on the big clearance\", lost any hope of a first-team place with the arrival of Jack Jones in the 1920 close season, and he left for Worksop Town in January 1921. He contributed to their Midland League title in 1922, and earned himself a return to the Football League with Newport County later that year. White made 44 appearances in the Third Division South for Newport before finishing off his career with Kidderminster Harriers of the Birmingham & District League.White died in Wednesbury, Staffordshire, in 1960 aged about 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas White", "response": ["* Tom White (film), 2004 Australian drama film", "* Tom White (Nebraska politician) (born 1956), Nebraska state senator", "* Tom White (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131960), English football full-back for Birmingham and Newport County", "* Tom White (footballer, born 1924) (1924\u20131998), English footballer for Sunderland", "* Tom White (footballer, born 1939), Scottish footballer", "* Tom White (footballer, born 1976), English football defender for Bristol Rovers, Hereford United and Yeovil Town", "* Tom White (footballer, born 1997), English footballer for Barrow", "* Tom White (rugby), English rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s and 1910s", "* Tom White (rugby league, born 1893) (1893\u20131927), English rugby league footballer who played in the 1910s and 1920s", "* Tom White (American football official), American football official", "* Tom White (athlete) (1917\u20131985), British Olympic athlete", "* Tom White (hurler), Irish hurler"]}, {"page": "Tom White (footballer born 1896)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom White (footballer, born 1896)"]}]}}
