She was the second of five siblings, and oldest daughter of Francis Cramer Penrose and his wife Harriette Gibbes, the daughter of Francis Gibbes, a surgeon of Harewood in West Yorkshire. Her paternal grandmother was the well-known author Elizabeth Penrose, who published under the name Mrs Markham.Penrose, Dame Emily, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; accessed 2011-06-21. Penrose studied in a private school in Wimbledon before studying languages in Versailles, Paris, Dresden and Berlin. She also trained as an artist with her father; a watercolour of the Parthenon attributed to her is in the collection of the British Museum. She lived with her family in Athens during 1886\u201387 while her father was director of the British School, during which time she kept a diary detailing her life in Athens and travels around Greece, and learned modern Greek. Her diary, now held at the British School, records her participation in the academic and social life of Athens, especially that of the foreign archaeological schools (which included the British School, the American School of Classical Studies, the German Archaeological Institute, and the French School). The British School also has at least one watercolour painting probably by her. Penrose read for her degree at Somerville College at the University of Oxford, where she started as a scholar of Greats (Classics) in 1889; this involved her learning both Latin and ancient Greek from scratch. At the time, Honour Moderations for Classics were not open to women, so she moved straight to Finals without taking any other examinations during her course of study. She chose to specialise in archaeology after her experiences in Athens, and in 1892 became the first woman to achieve First Class honours in Greats (Classics). As women were not able to gain a degree from the University of Oxford at that time, she was awarded an ad eundem University of Dublin Master of Arts degree in 1904. These degrees were awarded by the University of Dublin regularly between 1904 and 1907, in recognition of the work of women whose own universities did not award degrees to women at the time."]}, {"page": "Marnham, Nottinghamshire", "response": ["Edmund was also the father of the famous 'Mrs Markham', children's writer Elizabeth Penrose.
