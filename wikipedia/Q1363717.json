His use of a revolutionary combination bat with different rubbers on either side, coupled with his defensive play, led to one of sport's greatest upsets. At the time of his victory John trained at the Manchester YMCA, where he was only ranked at number 4, despite being ranked at number 1 in Europe and number 5 in the world. His odds of winning the tournament were rated at 1,000\u20131.Ultimately, the table tennis authorities had to change the rules because of Hilton, so that either side of a bat had different coloured rubbers. This gave the opposing player the chance to spot which rubber their opponent was using. Hilton used a bat which had black rubber (one side antispin, the other side very spinny) on both sides, meaning that opponents generally had no clue which rubber he was using when he 'twiddled' his bat in mid-rally, especially when his sleight of hand was coupled with him squeaking the soles of his shoes on the floor at the moment of bat on ball impact to mask the slight difference in sound between the antispin and spinny surfaces.\nHilton still plays table tennis in the Bolton league, which his team won in the 2012\u201313 season. John has won many Veteran titles and to date, is the only British player to have won the gold medal in the Men's Singles event at the Table Tennis European Championships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 25", "response": ["*1947 \u2013 John Hilton, English table tennis player"]}, {"page": "List of table tennis players", "response": ["*  John Hilton: winner of European Championships in 1980"]}, {"page": "John Hilton", "response": ["John Hilton and Jack Hilton may refer to:", "== John Hilton ==", "*John Hilton (American football) (1942\u20132017), American football tight end", "*John Hilton the elder (1565\u20131609), British composer", "*John Hilton the younger (c. 1599\u20131657), British composer, son of the above", "*John Hilton (industrial relations) (1880\u20131943), British professor of industrial relations", "*John Hilton (manufacturer) (c. 1791\u20131866), Canadian businessperson", "*John Hilton (surgeon) (1805\u20131878), British surgeon", "*John Hilton (table tennis) (born 1947), retired British table tennis player", "*John Hilton (cricketer, born 1792) (1792\u2013?), English cricketer", "*John Hilton (cricketer, born 1838) (1838\u20131910), English cricketer.", "*John Hilton Grace (1873\u20131958), British mathematician", "*John Hilton (soccer) (born 2001), American soccer player"]}, {"page": "European Table Tennis Championships", "response": ["|  John Hilton"]}, {"page": "John Hilton (table tennis player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hilton (table tennis)"]}, {"page": "English National Table Tennis Championships", "response": ["| 1979/80||Desmond Douglas||Carole Knight||Paul Day  Nicky Jarvis||Carole Knight  Anita Stevenson||John Hilton  Jill Hammersley"]}, {"page": "English Open (table tennis)", "response": ["| 1991/92|| John Hilton|| Judy Williams", "| 1995/96|| John Hilton|| Pauline Perry", "| John Hilton   Malcolm Corking"]}, {"page": "Table Tennis England", "response": ["| John Hilton"]}, {"page": "List of England players at the World Team Table Tennis Championships", "response": ["|Paul Day, Desmond Douglas, John Hilton, Nicky Jarvis", "|Paul Day, Desmond Douglas, John Hilton, Douggie Johnson", "| Desmond Douglas, John Hilton, Carl Prean, Graham Sandley"]}, {"page": "Douggie Johnson", "response": ["He represented England in the 1981 World Table Tennis Championships in the Swaythling Cup (men's team event) with Paul Day, Desmond Douglas and John Hilton."]}, {"page": "List of European Table Tennis Championships medalists", "response": ["|rowspan=2| John Hilton"]}]}}
