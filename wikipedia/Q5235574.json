One of the first was Irish-born, Montreal-based George Martin, who in 1887 published a long narrative poem entitled \"The Legend of Marguerite\". (Martin is now little-known, but he was apparently a friend of Charles Heavysege, and was mentioned by David James O'Donoghue as \"one of the leading poets of Canada\".Poets of Ireland, cited by DWS Ryan in the introduction to the 1995 republication of The Legend of Marguerite.). In 1949, Dinah Silveira de Queiroz published Margarida La Rocque: a ilha do dem\u00f4nios, inspired by Thevet's Cosmography; the Brazilian novel was translated into Spanish and French. In 1960, George Woodcock composed a verse play for CBC Radio entitled The Island of Demons. In 1975, historian Elizabeth Boyer wrote the novel Marguerite de la Roque: A Story of Survival; and in 1983, A Colony of One: The History of a Brave Woman. In 1995, Donald Wilson Stanley Ryan republished George Martin's The Legend of Marguerite, over a century  after its appearance, adding an explanatory introduction for the Breakwater Books edition. Charles Goulet's novel was entitled The Isle of Demons (2000),Goulet, Charles (2000) The Isle of Demons, AuthorHouse,  and Joan Elizabeth Goodman wrote a novel for young adults in 2002, entitled Paradise.Goodman, Joan Elizabeth (2002) Paradise: Based on a True Story of Survival, HMCo Children's Books,  In 2003, Douglas Glover published Elle: A Novel,Glover, Douglas (2003) Elle: A Novel,  Goose Lane Editions,  which won that year's Governor's General book prize. Robert Chafe wrote a bilingual play Isle of Demons, first produced in 2004. Canadian poet bpNichol depicted her in his poem \"lament\". The British writer Sara Maitland discusses the story in A Book of Silence (2008) and in a short story, \"The Tale of the Valiant Demoiselle,\" in Far North and Other Dark Tales (2008). (Maitland, one of the few non-Canadians to take up the tale, also mentions a 1916 narrative poem by Isabel Mackay). Also in 2008, Annamarie Beckel wrote Silence of Stone (Breakwater Books), a novel which switches between Marguerite on the island and Marguerite as headmistress. In 2016, Theatre Passe Muraille produced a play called Elle (She), an adaptation by Severn Thompson of Glover's novel."]}, {"page": "Ida L.
