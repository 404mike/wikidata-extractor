The match was refereed by Mr. J. Lewis, who had helped found Blackburn Rovers, the FA Cup holders and would later referee three FA Cup finals and the Gold Medal match at the 1920 Olympic Games. (The \"Saints\" would meet Mr. Lewis again in controversial circumstances in the 1898 FA Cup Semi-final.) The match at Warmley passed without incident with Ernie Nicholls scoring the club's first goal in the FA Cup as St. Mary's progressed to the second qualifying round."]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 St. Mary's F.C. season", "response": ["At the start of the season, the club's administration was in disarray as the secretary, Mr. J. Hendin was seriously ill and was convalescing in Brighton. As a result, by the end of August no fixture list had been printed and rumours were circulating in the local press that the club was \u00a350 in debt. Several of the club's best players were unavailable with F. A. Delamotte's work as a surveyor taking him to Derby and Ernie Nicholls also leaving the area; Arthur Farwell's employment with Edwin Jones made him unavailable to play on Saturday afternoons.", "In the Second Qualifying Round they played Maidenhead at the Antelope Ground on 29 October 1892. Although the team was boosted by Ernie Nicholls (who had returned from his temporary absence) and George Ridges (on loan from Freemantle), they suffered a 4\u20130 defeat. Apart from the Hampshire County Cricket Club Charity Cup the previous April, this was the Saints first defeat in a cup match. Three of Maidenhead's goals were scored by F.W. Janes. St. Mary's promptly signed Janes on professional terms, but the signing was revoked by the Football Association, who judged that he was \"in no fit condition to realise what he was doing when he signed for Southampton\", presumably because he had consumed too much alcohol at the time of signing."]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 St. Mary's F.C. season", "response": ["Although he continued to play, F. A. Delamotte stood down as club secretary and was replaced by John Hendin, with Harry Johns being appointed treasurer. Canon Basil Wilberforce remained as Honorary President although Dr. Russell Bencraft, the senior committee member, was responsible for the running of the club. There were two new members of the playing staff; George Marshall and Ernie Nicholls, both of whom would remain with the club for several years. The only player remaining from the eleven who played in the inaugural match in November 1885 was regular goalkeeper Ralph Ruffell although Arthur Fry made a brief return, making one cup appearance in goal in the absence of Ruffell. Apart from this change, the same eleven players appeared in all five cup matches played during the 1890\u201391 season.", "As the holders, the Engineers were favourites to take the trophy for a third consecutive season. Playing at the County Ground in front of a record crowd estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000, who paid entrance fees totalling \u00a363, St. Mary's took the lead after 20 minutes, through Ernie Nicholls who produced \"a stinging shot which no goalkeeper could have saved\" although the Engineers were level by half-time, following a slip by the Saints' captain, George Carter. In the second half, goals from Frank Bromley (\"a cheer rent the air that might have been heard more than a mile away\") and Bob Kiddle (\"the delight of the Southampton people knew no bounds\") gave St. Mary's the victory, thus remaining undefeated in four seasons of Hampshire cup football. The Southampton Times commented that \"Saints never played a better game\"; \"once more, they had walked smiling through their opponents\".", "*Ernie Nicholls (1871\u20131971) had first played in friendly matches as a 16-year old in 1888. He remained with the club until the advent of the Southern League in 1894, during which period he was the club's most prolific goalscorer."]}]}}
