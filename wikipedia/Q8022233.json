Their leader, William Wakefield, later travelled to the Bay of Islands to pledge allegiance to the Crown.

At an Executive Council meeting, 29 December 1842, Swainson said that those parts of New Zealand where Maori chiefs refused to sign the Treaty or had not been asked to sign were not British territory. Willoughby Shortland, the Colonial Secretary for New Zealand, who was also at the meeting, asked Swainson to prepare a paper about this. Swainson said it was possible that English law and Maori customary law might coexist. Lord Edward Stanley, Secretary of the Colonies, was angry with the paper when it arrived in England.

Shortland was fresh from New South Wales, where the press was controlled, and in December 1840, recalling an old ordinance from that colony, he ordered Quaife to post several hundred pounds' surety and pay a fine.  Should he do neither, he would face penal transportation for publishing \"tending to bring the Government into hatred or contempt\".  Consequently, the last edition of the Advertiser appeared on 10 December.  Undeterred, Quaife returned to publishing in 1842, launching the Bay of Islands Observer.  His platform was much the same as before.  Foolishly, however, he printed some gossip about George Cooper, a former colonial treasurer.  He apologized publicly, but was still dismissed by the paper's owners.  From that time forward he devoted himself to the Kororareka Congregational Church, which he had founded as New Zealand's first Congregational church in 1840.

Willoughby Shortland was in the act of a magisterial examination of the charge against Kihi when Te Haratua, a chief from Pakaraka, arrived with about three hundred armed warriors and began a haka.

Williams, who was present as a witness, identified that Te Haratua and the warriors did not have any hostile intentions, having come over to make a public display of their abhorrence of the murder.

He was furious when he heard of the proceedings at Port Nicholson, characterising the actions of the council of colonists as high treason. He at once proclaimed the Queen's sovereignty over both the North and South Islands, a proceeding which might otherwise have been long delayed, and in hot haste despatched the acting Colonial Secretary, Willoughby Shortland, to Port Nicholson to dissolve the council, displace their officers, and cancel their acts. Instead, however, of meeting with opposition, Shortland was cordially welcomed by the supposed rebellious settlers when he arrived at Port Nicholson on 2 June 1840. He was at once waited on by Dr. Evans and two others, who assured him of the loyalty of the community. Two days later the provisional government was declared illegal, and the Queen's authority formally proclaimed. On 1 July following a great public meeting was held, at which Dr. Evans moved the adoption of a loyal address to Captain Hobson in a long speech, in which, whilst vindicating the legality of the proceedings of the council, he advised the settlers to sacrifice their feelings and submit to its dissolution with a good grace. He strongly advocated the claims of Wellington to be regarded as the seat of government, and the address was then adopted. On 19 August Dr. Evans presided over another meeting at which the reply of Governor Hobson to the address was received. Subsequently, the meeting deputed Dr. Evans, Hanson, Moreing to proceed to Sydney to lay before the Governor of New South Wales (Sir George Gipps), who then had superior jurisdiction over New Zealand, the views of the settlers on the land question, a Bill being then before the Legislative Council of New South Wales having for its object to cancel all rights acquired of the Maoris except such as her Majesty might allow. The Bill was passed, but it was really more particularly aimed at the exorbitant claims of New South Wales residents like Mr. Wentworth, who professed to have acquired twenty million acres from the Maoris, than at the requirements of genuine settlers such as those at Port Nicholson. Dr. Evans and his colleagues were therefore successful in their mission, a fact which they reported to a public meeting on 11 December. In the meantime the Government did not give satisfaction, and in July 1841, when Governor Hobson proposed revisiting Port Nicholson, Dr. Evans took an active part in opposing the presentation of a congratulatory address to him pending the disclosure of the Government policy on various matters affecting the welfare of the settlers. He carried an amendment to this effect, despite the support given to the motion for the address by Mr. Hanson."]}, {"page": "James Coates (parliamentary official)", "response": ["Coates' career in New Zealand began on 12 July 1840 when he was appointed as a clerk (third class) in the office of the colonial secretary, reporting to the Colonial Secretary Willoughby Shortland  through the Chief Clerk James Stuart Freeman.
