He was a member of every Conservative administration between 1866 and 1898, and notably served three times as Lord Chamberlain of the Household under Lord Salisbury. Having succeeded his grandfather as Baron Skelmersdale in 1853, he was created Earl of Lathom in 1880.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hall Caine", "response": ["Caine's Mahomet is a four-act historical drama based on the life of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, written in 1890 for the actor-manager Henry Irving.  In Autumn 1889 Irving presented a copy of Henri de Bornier's new play Mahomet to Caine, translated into English by Bram Stoker's wife, Florence. Irving had been granted the English rights by Jules Claretie, director of France's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais and he asked Caine to revise it for staging at the Lyceum. The French government stopped Bornier's play on 22 March 1890, partly due to the intervention of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Caine called the play's plot \"false to history, untrue to character, Western in thought and Parisian in sentiment\". He continued with his own version that concentrated on Muhammad's flight from Mecca and his triumphant return from Medina years later. Scenes were handwritten by Caine and subsequently reviewed by Irving after Stoker had them typed. Reviewed pages were returned with Irving's edits and often Stoker's suggestions. On 20 June a piece appeared in the French Journal des d\u00e9bats soon followed by a longer piece in The Pall Mall Gazette connecting Bornier's Mahomet with Irving's English production. William Henry (Abdullah) Quilliam orchestrated protests. In common with Caine he was of Manx descent, raised in Liverpool and had visited Morocco. Converting to Islam, Quilliam set up Britain's first mosque and was made Sheikh al-Islam for the British Isles by Abdul Hamid II.  Rumour that the play would be produced in London caused unrest in Britain's Muslim communities, threatened British rule in parts of India and strained the nation's relations with the Ottoman Empire. It was banned by the Lord Chamberlain, Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom in his capacity as licencer of stage plays. Lathom's intervention was unusual, illustrating the high level of concern by the British government. Caine's completed play was accepted by Edward Smith Willard for production in America. Influenced by Renan's Life of Christ he spent the remainder of 1890 hastily writing his own version. Dissatisfied with the result he refused to publish the book, despite being offered three thousand pounds for it in 1894."]}, {"page": "George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon", "response": ["*Lady Alice Villiers (1841\u20131897), married Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom."]}, {"page": "Baron Skelmersdale", "response": ["*Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom, 2nd Baron Skelmersdale (1837\u20131898)"]}, {"page": "United Grand Lodge of England", "response": ["*Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom (1891 to 1898)"]}, {"page": "Lord William Cecil (bishop)", "response": ["He was ordained in 1887, and married Lady Florence (\"Fluffy\") Mary Bootle-Wilbraham, daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom on 16 August of the same year.
