Lee's batting and bowling styles are unknown.  He was born at Thame, Oxfordshire.\nLee made his debut for Oxfordshire against Cambridgeshire in the 1904 Minor Counties Championship.  He made four further appearances in that season.  Later while in the British Raj, where he was a tea planter, Lee made his first-class debut for a Bengal Governor's XI against the Maharaja of Cooch-Behar's XI at Eden Gardens, Calcutta, in November 1917.  He made further first-class appearance for the team in a repeat of the fixture in December 1918.  In his two first-class appearances for the team, he scored 60 runs at an average of 20.00, with a high score of 40 not out.  In January 1919, he made a third and final first-class appearance, this time for MC Bird's XI against the Maharaja of Cooch-Behar's XI, scoring 9 runs.Later returning to England, he resumed playing for Oxfordshire in 1922, following an eighteen-year gap since his last appearance for the county.  This was also Oxfordshire's first season in the Minor Counties Championship since 1906.  From 1922 to 1938, he made 81 further appearance for the county in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against Berkshire at the Christ Church Ground, Oxford.  His playing span of 34 years from 1904 to 1938 is the longest career span by an Oxfordshire cricketer, some four years ahead of Keith Arnold's thirty years, though Arnold's thirty-year span was unbroken.  He had on occasion also captained the county.He died at Brixworth, Northamptonshire, on 2 February 1960.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stewart Lee", "response": ["In December 2011, he won British Comedy Awards for best male television comic and best comedy entertainment programme for his series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle.

The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris. The first episode received positive reviews from The Independent. and the Daily Mirror. Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in Time Out in which he described himself as \"fat\" and his performance as \"positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft\". The Guardian described it as \"the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity\". One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: \"His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension\". Lee used the line to advertise his next stand-up tour. Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.", "In September 2020, Asian Dub Foundation (a political band from London who had a Top 40 hit with \"Buzzin'\" in 1998) released a song called \"Comin\u2019 Over Here\", which was based on a sketch from Lee's Comedy Vehicle about the then UKIP party leader Paul Nuttall. In December 2020, Lee teamed up with Asian Dub Foundation to release a video for the song, which was now part of an internet campaign (in the style of LadBaby, Rage Against The Machine et al.) to get the record to number one in time for the chart published by the Official Charts Company on 31 December 2020, thereby making the record the 'Brexit Day Number One'.
