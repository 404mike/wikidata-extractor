He also served as President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division (now the Family Division) of High Court for nine years, and was a Law Lord for 6 years before his retirement in 1977.\nSimon's appointment, as of 2015, marks the last appointment of a former member of the House of Commons as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary (although Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne, appointed before Simon but retiring after Simon, was the last serving Law Lord to have previously served in the Commons.) As noted by The Independent in his obituary, \"Jack Simon was the last of a breed of judges who first pursued a successful career in politics before promotion to the Bench.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jocelyn Edward Salis Simon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}, {"page": "Lord Simon of Glaisdale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}, {"page": "Jocelyn Simon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}, {"page": "Baron Simon of Glaisdale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}, {"page": "Lord Simon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}, {"page": "Jocelyn Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}, {"page": "Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire", "response": ["* Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 2000s", "response": ["|Jack Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale"]}]}}
