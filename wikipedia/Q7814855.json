Bamford (1887 \u2013 9 August 1944) was an English professional footballer who played as a full back. Born in Horwich, he began his career in non-league football with Darwen before joining Burnley in 1909. He was part of the Burnley side that won the FA Cup in 1914, but then missed five years of his career due to the outbreak of the First World War. By the time league football resumed, Bamford was over 30 years of age, and found it difficult to regain his place in the team. After more than 150 first-team appearances for the club, Bamford left Burnley in 1920 to sign for Rochdale, where he ended his career.", "link_mentions": {}}}
