His The Reality of Time and the Existence of God set out to prove the existence of God from the fact that the world enjoys continuity in time. He argued that nothing in the world could be the cause of this continuity, whence God came into the picture. \nHis book The Human Person: Animal and Spirit attempts to provide a philosophical analysis of human beings which makes life after death possible.Due to a car accident in 1977, he became paralysed from the chest down. Braine was opposed to the legalisation of euthanasia, and based some of that opposition on his own personal experience of living with a disability.Braine was an important, if insufficiently well-known, contributor to the renaissance of analytical Philosophy of religion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of philosophy articles (D\u2013H)", "response": ["* David Braine (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* David Braine (1940\u20132017)"]}, {"page": "David Braine", "response": ["David Braine may refer to:", "*David Braine (philosopher) (1940\u20132017), British analytic philosopher", "*David Braine (athletic director) (born 1943), former athletic director for Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, and Marshall"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy of religion articles", "response": ["* David Braine (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "Index of contemporary philosophy articles", "response": ["* David Braine (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "Index of analytic philosophy articles", "response": ["* David Braine (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "Braine (surname)", "response": ["*David Braine (philosopher) (born 1940), British philosopher", "*David Braine (athletic director) (born 1943), former athletic director"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2017", "response": ["*David Braine, 76, British philosopher.Obituary: David Braine, leading Catholic philosopher who battled disability"]}]}}
