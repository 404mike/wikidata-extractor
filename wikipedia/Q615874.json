He has appeared in numerous films, such as Walt Disney's The Aristocats, where he voiced the evil butler Edgar Balthazar (his only voice role); Unconditional Love; and Clint Eastwood's White Hunter Black Heart, playing Thompson.\nAn early innovator at the Royal College of Art, RCA, alongside David Hockney and Peter Blake, he was one of the UK's first performance artists, before it was a recognized art form. At the RCA he edited ARK magazine in 1958 and was president of the college's Theatre Group. He had a joint exhibition with Blake at the Portal Gallery in 1960. He also collaborated in a pre-Monty Python series with Michael Palin and Terry Jones, called The Complete and Utter History of Britain. He also made theatrical and television appearances in, among other shows, The Goodies, Rowan and Martin's Laugh In, Not Only... But Also and  The Establishment. He won the Theatre of the Year Award for Best Comic New York in 1968 for his work as a stand-up comedian.\nMaude-Roxby has also worked with masks and improvisation for over 40 years and was a co-creator of improvisational games developed at the Royal Court Theatre, and then as \"Theatre Machine\" with Keith Johnstone.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 2", "response": ["*1930 \u2013 Roddy Maude-Roxby, English actor"]}, {"page": "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In", "response": ["Ruth Buzzi, Judy Carne, Henry Gibson, Larry Hovis, Arte Johnson, Ken Berry, Pamela Austin, Barbara Feldon and Jo Anne Worley appeared in the pilot special from 1967.

For a time guest star Flip Wilson or Sammy Davis Jr. would introduce the sketch saying \"Here come da judge!\", which was a venerable catchphrase by nightclub comedian Pigmeat Markham. Surprised that his trademark had been appropriated, Markham asked producer George Schlatter to let him play the Judge himself; Schlatter agreed and Markham presided for one season. After Markham left, the sketch was briefly retired until Sammy Davis Jr. donned the judicial robe and wig during his guest appearances, introducing each sketch with a rap that always finished with \"Here come da judge, here come da judge...\"."]}, {"page": "1990 in film", "response": ["| White Hunter Black Heart || Warner Bros.
