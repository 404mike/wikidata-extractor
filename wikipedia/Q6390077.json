Jamal Crawford was not re-signed to avoid going into the luxury tax. However, Sund also re-signed Collins, and added Tracy McGrady, Willie Green, Jannero Pargo, Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107, Jerry Stackhouse, and Eric Dampier, all at veterans minimums. Signing that many veteran minimum contracts pushed the Hawks into the luxury tax, although McGrady, Green, and Pargo had productive seasons. Childress also came back from Greece, and was signed-and-traded to Phoenix for a trade exception (not used) and a second-round draft pick (sold for cash to pay the luxury tax).http://blogs.ajc.com/hawks/2012/03/15/atlanta-hawks-hawks-trade-second-round-draft-pick-for-cash/ The Hawks also signed 27-year-old rookie Ivan Johnson, who had a productive season, even finishing as rookie of the month in April. The Hawks won 40 games in the lockout-shortened season despite Horford missing most of the season, and clinched home court and the #5 seed against the #4 division winner Boston Celtics.
