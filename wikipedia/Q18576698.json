It drew on quality stories from around the world and invited actors, writers, artists and celebrities to present stories that were particularly suitable for them. For example, Sir Compton Mackenzie retold Greek Legends and Margaret Rutherford read five Beatrix Potter tales."]}, {"page": "Anna Home", "response": ["With Joy Whitby and Molly Cox, Home developed Jackanory, which began its long run in 1965. \"At first people were unwilling to participate in this unknown programme\", Home recalled in 1997. \"But when actors realised it was the opportunity to have 15 minutes' solo experience on television, they began to queue up to get on it, and having done a Jackanory became a bit like having done your Desert Island Discs.\" Comedy actor Kenneth Williams, one of the most frequent participants in the series, recalled Home telling him: \"Never sound as if you're patronizing the young.\"Kenneth Williams Just Williams, Fontana, 1985, p.232"]}]}}
