Theoretical Girls played only about 20 shows (three of which took place in Paris). It released one single (\"U.S. Millie\"/\"You Got Me\"), which had some attention in England where it sold a few thousand copies. The band was never signed by a record company, but is well regarded as an early leading no wave group that mixed classical modern ideas of composition with punk rock. This experimental music was mostly supported by the New York art world and minimal art music audience.", "Theoretical Girls was formed after Branca and Lohn's previous group the Static and performed its first show at the Experimental Intermedia Foundation.

The latter played drums, the former guitar in the quartet, which also featured keyboardist Margaret De Wys and vocalist/guitarist Jeffrey Lohn, a classically trained composer who, like Branca and so many others in the no wave scene, wasn't interested in working with popular musical forms until inspired to do so by the explosion of punk rock. The group's sound shared aesthetics with the other no wave bands working in Manhattan at the time, such as The Contortions and DNA.

The first, which came out on Atavistic in 1995, consists of all the Glenn Branca-penned songs, including \"You Got Me\", the flipside from the group's only single. The A-side, \"U.S. Millie,\" appears on a newer collection of Theoretical Girls songs all written by Lohn.
