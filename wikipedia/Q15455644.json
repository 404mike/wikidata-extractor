In 1991 Thompson's son, Arthur Jr, was shot dead. Ferris was charged with his murder and subsequently found not guilty after what was the longest criminal trial in Scottish history at that time. He was imprisoned again from 1998 to 2002 for trading in firearms and possessing explosives. Ferris was also involved in a long-running feud with Tam McGraw.\nHis first book was published in 2001 while he was in prison.
