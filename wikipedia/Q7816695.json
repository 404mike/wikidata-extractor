An amateur during his playing days, he worked as a school teacher and later governor. He left this role in 1902 to become manager of Manchester City, helping them to their first major honour, the 1903\u201304 FA Cup. He was involved in the 1905 English football bribery scandal which resulted in him being banned from football. After leaving City in 1906 he became manager of Bradford Park Avenue then later assisted Southport.\nTwo of Maley's brothers also found fame in the footballing world. Alex Maley was a manager with Clyde, Clydebank, Hibernian and Crystal Palace while Willie Maley was a Scottish international and later manager of Celtic between 1897 and 1940. It was on a visit to the family home in Cathcart in December 1887 to invite Tom Maley to join Celtic that Brother Walfrid and the rest of the Celtic deputation first met Willie Maley (Tom was out courting his wife-to-be), and their casual invitation to Willie to also come along was perhaps the most important in Celtic's history.\nMaley died in 1935 and was buried at Kentigern RC cemetery in Glasgow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Robson", "response": ["In March 2011, the East Coast train operating company named one of its Class 91 electric locomotives Sir Bobby Robson, unveiled at Newcastle station by his widow Elsie and Alan Shearer. Similarly, in December 2011, the Port of Tyne Authority named its new work boat the Sir Bobby Robson. On 6 May 2012, a statue of Robson created by sculptor Tom Maley was unveiled at St James' Park before a 2\u20130 defeat to eventual champions Manchester City. On 16 July 2013, marking the 150th anniversary celebrations of the FA, the FA designated 10 August as the Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day, celebrated as a day to celebrate the national game. In 2018, Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, a feature-length British film about Robson's career and cancer diagnosis, was released to critical acclaim."]}, {"page": "Old Firm", "response": ["*Willie Maley and Tom Maley (Celtic)6-1 Vs Rangers, Glasgow Cup (27/10/1888) , Rangers FitbaStats"]}, {"page": "Billy Meredith", "response": ["Meredith found the net eight times in 38 games in the 1901\u201302 campaign, as City were relegated back out of the First Division. The club's secretary, Sam Ormerod, selected 29 different players as the club slumped to defeat in 13 of the opening 20 games. Ormerod was forced to step down, as new business figures took control behind the scenes and began to sign promising young Scottish players. New manager Tom Maley was more willing than his predecessor to confront Meredith over his tendency to stray out of position and attempt to dominate the City attack.", "He scored nine goals in 36 games in the 1904\u201305 season, as City came within two points and two places of champions Newcastle United. The season ended in controversial circumstances at Villa Park, and with a 3\u20132 defeat to Aston Villa ending any hopes of winning the league, Sandy Turnbull and Villa captain Alex Leake exchanged blows. The Football Association launched an investigation into the violence, and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the 1905\u201306 season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake. No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and the evidence was not made public. The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign. He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road. The FA acted on his information, and fined Manchester City \u00a3900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players, boardroom members and staff members."]}]}}
