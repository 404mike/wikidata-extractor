Born in Manchester, England, he began his career as a youth player with his hometown club Manchester United. After a loan spell at Stalybridge Celtic, he moved to Bristol Rovers in 1998, where he scored one goal in 60 league appearances. Trees also had loan spells at Altrincham for a couple of months in 1999, and at Leigh RMI. Leigh signed him on a permanent basis in February 2001, but he soon moved on to Droylsden in August of the same year. Trees played for Mossley during the 2002\u201303 season, but personal issues forced him to take a short break from football in September 2002. He then joined Hyde United in the summer of 2003, but his spell there was short-lived and he moved to Abbey Hey that December. After 18 months with Abbey Hey, Trees joined the newly formed F.C. United of Manchester in July 2005 and was part of the club's initial 20-man squad for their 2005\u201306 pre-season. However, he never played in a senior game for them. He now has 2 children Francesca and Gabriella Trees with his wife Sharon Trees. Trees played for Witton Albion prior to joining Bristol Rovers, making his debut on 8 March 1998, playing 11 games and scoring one goal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1997\u201398 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["Leaving in the winter were Czech midfielder Karel Poborsk\u00fd, English forward Neil Mustoe, and English defender John O'Kane.
