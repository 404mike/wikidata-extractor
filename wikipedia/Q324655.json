In August 1917, Tudor conceived the idea of a surprise attack in the IV Corps sector, he suggested a primarily artillery-infantry attack, which would be supported by a small number of tanks, to secure a breakthrough of the German Hindenburg Line. The German defences were formidable; Cambrai having been a quiet stretch of front thus far enabled the Germans to fortify their lines in depth and the British were aware of this. Tudor's plan sought to test new methods in combined arms, with emphasis on combined artillery and infantry techniques and see how effective they were against strong German fortifications. Tudor advocated using the new sound ranging and silent registration of guns to achieve instant suppression fire and surprise. He also wanted to use tanks to clear paths through the deep barbed wire obstacles in front of German positions, while supporting the tank force with the No. 106 Fuze, designed to explode high explosive (HE) ammunition without cratering the ground to supplement the armour."]}, {"page": "Auxiliary Division", "response": ["The Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary (ADRIC), generally known as the Auxiliaries or Auxies, was a paramilitary unit of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence.

Almost 2,300 served in the unit during the conflict. Its role was to conduct counter-insurgency operations against the Irish Republican Army (IRA), acting mainly as a mobile striking and raiding force.

In February 1921, he dismissed 21 auxiliaries under his command after their raids on Trim, County Meath and Drumcondra, Dublin that left two young men dead. His superior, the Chief of Police in Ireland Henry Hugh Tudor, ordered the auxiliaries reinstated. Crozier resigned in protest. This made it impossible for him to find other official employment. Crozier unsuccessfully ran in the 1923 general election for the Labour Party in Portsmouth Central. He turned to writing and lecturing to earn a living, though unpaid bills and dishonoured cheques continued to follow him. Crozier's books were politically controversial, viewed by the Government they criticised as inaccurate, and dismissive toward Crozier as \"discredited.\" He became a pacifist, an active member of the Peace Pledge Union, and a speaker for the League of Nations Union.
