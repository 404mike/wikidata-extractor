This was after his first penalty back in a Preston shirt was saved by Exeter's Artur Krysiak, and before his third was saved by Lee Butcher of Leyton Orient. His next penalty came in a penalty shootout against Rochdale in the Football League Trophy, which was slotted into the top corner after he was brought on as a substitute for Conor McLaughlin especially to take a penalty in the shootout. However, he missed his next penalty, again in the Football League Trophy, and again in a penalty shootout, this time against Chesterfield. He was the third Preston player to take a penalty in this shootout, and he blazed it over the bar, much to the disbelief of the fans. Preston's next penalty-taker, Paul Coutts, had his penalty saved, and then when the next penalty was scored by Chesterfield's Alexandre Mendy, Preston got knocked out of the tournament. Alexander started the next league game against Stevenage but was replaced through injury by Steven Smith after just 3 minutes, after which Alexander did not feature for the Lilywhites for a long time, and there was speculation that he had played his last game for Preston, and in his career."]}, {"page": "EFL Awards", "response": ["* Conor McLaughlin"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland national under-21 football team", "response": ["|Conor McLaughlin"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["| Conor McLaughlin", "|Young Player of The Season Award || Conor McLaughlin "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["| Conor McLaughlin", "|3||||DF||Conor McLaughlin||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["|21 || ||DF ||Conor McLaughlin || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 0", "| Conor McLaughlin"]}]}}
