Lazzaro Vasari, the great-grandfather of art historian Giorgio Vasari, was Luca's maternal uncle. According to Giorgio Vasari, Lazzaro had Luca apprenticed to Piero della Francesca. In 1472 the young artist was painting at Arezzo, and in 1474 at Citt\u00e0 di Castello. He presented to Lorenzo de' Medici a work which is likely School of Pan. Janet Ross and her husband Henry discovered the painting in Florence circa 1870 and subsequently sold it to the Kaiser Frederick Museum in Berlin, though it was destroyed by allied bombs in WWII.See: Benjamin, Sarah, A Castle In Tuscany, pp. 63\u201367 (image of the painting at pp. 64\u201365), Murdoch Books, Australia, 2006.

Florence became his headquarters in Italy after the removal of the government thence from Turin, and so it remained even after the transfer of the capital to Rome. He spent a portion of each year in England, and during the last fifteen years of his life wintered at Leucaspide, near Taranto, where he had made large purchases of monastic lands in 1868. In 1884, the English writer Janet Ross and her husband travelled to Apulia where they stayed with Sir James Lacaita at his estate (Villa Leuc\u00e0spide). While there, Janet travelled extensively throughout the region. The trip inspired her book Land of Manfred prince of Tarentum... (London 1899), which she dedicated to Lacaita. He was a director of the Italian company for the Southern Railways from its formation, and took a share in the management of several Anglo-Italian public companies. Besides his English title, he was a knight of the Brazilian order of the Rose, and knight commander of S.

It seems to have been a response to criticism that he was not writing about serious issues. It was also a response, in part, to the founding of Queen's College, London, Britain's first college for women, in 1847.Scott (1992).The college was not quite a higher education institution in the modern sense: it admitted girls and women from the age of twelve upwards, and is now an independent secondary school for girls: see  Cockburn, King & McDonnell 1968, p. 311-312 Two of Tennyson's friends were part-time professors there. Other critics speculate that the poem was partly inspired by the opening of Love's Labour's Lost and other literary works.Lang (1904), Chapter IV \u2013 1842\u20131848 \u2014 The Princess.Zimmerman (2008), p. 77.
