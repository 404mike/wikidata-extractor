Fountain, a left-sided forward, struggled to compete with Fred Wheldon and Toddy Hands. He made his debut in the First Division on 9 February 1895 in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Sunderland, and played once more during that season and once towards the end of the next, before returning to local football in the Midlands area.He married Emily Jane Payne in Birmingham on 21 December 1895. He died in 1946.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1894\u201395 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Joe Fountain made his debut against Sunderland as a late replacement for Wheldon, whose sister had died on the morning of the match. On a slippery pitch \"thickly strewn with chaff and hayseeds\", Small Heath fell a goal behind in a first half dominated by the defences of both teams. The special training undertaken by the home side in preparation for the match took effect, as \"in the closing stages they looked winners all over\", and Sunderland had goalkeeper Ned Doig to thank for restricting the scoring to just Tommy Hands' equaliser. The attendance of 15,000 was nearly double the highest recorded in previous seasons.Matthews (1995), Complete Record, pp. 140\u201342.", "The players went to Malvern for special training before the home game with Burnley. Joe Fountain was an \"excellent\" stand-in for the injured Tommy Hands at outside left and Jenkyns was \"a tower of strength\" as Wheldon scored the only goal of a scrappy game to bring Small Heath's points total to 22 with three matches left. The Daily Post predicted that 24 would be enough to avoid the test matches. On Easter Monday, Hands returned to the team for the last home League match of the season, a goalless draw with Sheffield Wednesday in which both teams had numerous chances to score."]}]}}
