The Voronezh is defined by the opening sequence 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6 cxd6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Be3 Bg7 8.Rc1 0-0 9.b3. White's setup delays   so that Black has trouble developing pieces in a fashion that harasses White's pieces and assails the centre pawns; for instance there is no knight on f3 which can become a target after ...Bg4, and no bishop on d3 which may be a target after ...Nc6\u2013e5. While 9...Nc6 is Black's most common reply according to ChessBase's database, after 10.d5 Ne5 Black's knight lacks a target, and will soon be chased out with f2\u2013f4, and this line has scored very poorly for Black. The main line in the Voronezh, and the second most common reply, is 9...e5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd8 Rxd8 12.c5 N6d7 (This retreat is forced since 12...Nd5?? loses the knight due to the 13.Rd1 pin) when Black must play carefully to unentangle and challenge the white pawn on c5. Other lines against the Voronezh include 9...f5 leading to sharp play. Other solid moves such as 9...e6, ...Bd7, ...Bf5, and ...a5 are possible as well. According to John Cox, the 9...e5 line is adequate, but Black needs to know the line well."]}, {"page": "Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit", "response": ["GM Boris Avrukh has written that the gambit \"may not be fully correct\" but cautioned that he \"was surprised at just how potent White's initiative could become\". Although he was unable to fully refute the gambit and considered that Black faced a non-trivial defensive task, he felt that with correct play Black could emerge with good chances. GM Joe Gallagher wrote that he had \"noticed a common trend among Blackmar\u2013Diemer analysts; once there is no attack and the position looks rather balanced they tend to assess the game as =, forgetting the fact that they are a pawn down.\" Gallagher thought that the closely related H\u00fcbsch Gambit gave an equal game but that the Blackmar\u2013Diemer provided \"not really enough compensation\" and there were \"a number of areas where Black could fight for the advantage.\" Nevertheless, he cautioned that Black \"inaccuracies can be swiftly punished\" in the Blackmar\u2013Diemer. IM John Cox wrote that the gambit was \"objectively weak\" but pragmatically recommended that Black should enter the H\u00fcbsch gambit instead of accepting the Blackmar\u2013Diemer as \"sod's law dictates that [the reader would meet the gambit] in the third Saturday game of a weekender, when few of us are at our sharpest tactically ... one slip sees you getting torched.\""]}, {"page": "British Chess Magazine", "response": ["* John Cox is a lawyer and International Master.
