It was first described in 1842 by John Edward Gray, who placed it in the genus Phascogale. He identified the specimen as being Australasian in origin.  The genus Parantechinus was created for the species in 1947 by George Henry Hamilton Tate. The species was also assigned to the genus Antechinus, before being split to its own genus. There are various arrangements of the genera in this section of family Dasyuridae, many of which are supported by molecular systematics, and their relationship remains unresolved."]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Tate \u2013 George Henry Hamilton Tate (1894\u20131953)"]}, {"page": "Tate (taxonomy)", "response": ["#redirect George Henry Hamilton Tate"]}, {"page": "Heliamphora tatei", "response": ["Heliamphora tatei (after George Henry Hamilton Tate) is a species of marsh pitcher plant endemic to Cerro Duida, Cerro Huachamacari and Cerro Marahuaca in Venezuela.

These specimens belonged to a  single species Scolomys melanops, and for a long time the genus was considered to be monotypic. However, following survey work in the upper Amazon basin many decades later, a further species S. ucayalensis was described from northern Peru by Pacheco in 1991, followed by a third, S. juruaense from western Brazil by Patton and da Silva in 1994. In 2004, Gomez-Laverde and co-workers reviewed the systematics of the genus and its distribution, and suggested that S. juruaense was not sufficiently distinct from S. ucayalensis to warrant being classified as a separate species."]}, {"page": "Tate's shrew rat", "response": ["It is found only in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it has been recorded on Mount Latimodjong (Mount Rantemario), Mount Tokala, and Mount Nokilalaki.
