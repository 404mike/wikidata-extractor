He has won the BBC Jazz Awards Rising Star (2007), Jazz Journal's  Critics' Choice album of the Year (2009), the British Jazz Awards Top Tenor Saxophonist (2011), the Services to British Jazz award (2016).\nIn 2017, he was leading his own quartet featuring pianist John Critchinson, bassist Alec Dankworth and drummer Clark Tracey, as well as appearing with bands led by other leaders including the Ronnie Scott's Jazz Orchestra. He also works as a guest soloist at jazz venues across the UK. After John Critchinson died, Robin Aspland joined the quartet on piano. His many club and festival appearances include sold-out gigs at Ronnie Scott's and the Brecon Jazz Festival, and he has made several appearances leading his own group on BBC Radio 3.\nLeading British jazz figures with whom he has worked include Sir John Dankworth, Stan Tracey, Peter King, Liane Carroll, Tina May, John Etheridge, Guy Barker, Alan Barnes and Bobby Wellins. American musicians with whom he has worked include Jon Hendricks, Kurt Elling, Bobby Shew and Monica Mancini.\nSpillett's biography of saxophonist Tubby Hayes - The Long Shadow Of The Little Giant (Equinox, 2015) - has been widely praised as one of the finest jazz biographies to have been published in recent years.\nSince 2016, he has contributed a regular monthly column to Jazz Journal, mixing humorous reflections on his experiences as a musician with observations about famous historical jazz figures and reportage on the current UK jazz circuit.\nHis stage presentation skills combine dry humour, anecdotes about jazz history and self-deprecating wit. He has also acted as a compere at several jazz festivals and appears in the anchor interview role in the 2015 documentary film, Tubby Hayes: A Man In A Hurry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Booker Ervin", "response": ["In 2017, Ervin was the subject of a mini-biography written by English saxophonist and author Simon Spillett, published as part of an anthology package titled The Good Book (Acrobat Records)"]}, {"page": "Tubby Hayes", "response": ["In 2015, a full-length biography, The Long Shadow of The Little Giant: The Life, Work and Legacy of Tubby Hayes by Simon Spillett was published by Equinox Publishing.
