For example, Grace Eckley argues that Wakean characters are distinct from each other,Herring, Joyce's Uncertainty Principle, p.186 and defends this with explaining the dual narrators, the \"us\" of the first paragraph, as well as Shem-Shaun distinctions while Margot Norris argues that the \"[c]haracters are fluid and interchangeable\".Norris, Margot, The decentered universe of Finnegans wake, p.4 Supporting the latter stance, Van Hulle finds that the \"characters\" in Finnegans Wake are rather \"archetypes or character amalgams, taking different shapes\", and Riquelme similarly refers to the book's cast of mutable characters as \"protean\".Riquelme 1983, p. 8 As early as in 1934, in response to the recently published excerpt \"The Mookse and the Gripes\", Ronald Symond argued that \"the characters in Work in Progress, in keeping with the space-time chaos in which they live, change identity at will. At one time they are persons, at another rivers or stones or trees, at another personifications of an idea, at another they are lost and hidden in the actual texture of the prose, with an ingenuity far surpassing that of crossword puzzles.\"Symond, Ronald, quoted in James Joyce: The Critical Heritage, p.606 Such concealment of character identity has resulted in some disparity as to how critics identify the book's main protagonists; for example, while most find consensus that Festy King, who appears on trial in I.4, is a HCE type, not all analysts agree on this \u2013 for example Anthony Burgess believes him to be Shaun.Burgess, A Shorter Finnegans Wake, p.17"]}, {"page": "Transition (literary journal)", "response": ["Also Paul Bowles, Bob Brown,  Kathleen Cannell, Malcolm Cowley, Hart Crane, Abraham Lincoln Gillespie Jr. (on music), Eugene Jolas (also as Theo Rutra), Marius Lyle, Robert McAlmon, Archibald McLeish Allen Tate; Bryher, Morley Callaghan, Rhys Davies, Robert Graves, Sidney Hunt, Robie Macauley, Laura Riding, Ronald Symond, Dylan Thomas."]}, {"page": "Liverpool College", "response": ["* Ronald Symond - Author"]}]}}
