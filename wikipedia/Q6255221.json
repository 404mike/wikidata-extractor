He served as a councillor on Lanarkshire County Council and Motherwell and Wishaw Council from 1946.\nAt the 1951 general election Robertson stood as the Labour candidate in the marginal Conservative-held seat of Glasgow Scotstoun, losing by 625 votes. He was elected to the House of Commons ten years later at the 1961 by-election in the Paisley constituency, following the appointment of sitting MP Douglas Johnston as a judge in the Court of Session. He was re-elected at five subsequent general elections, sitting as a Labour MP until 1976, and for the SLP between 1976 and 1979. He did not contest the 1979 general election.\nOn 18 January 1976 Robertson, along with another Labour MP, Jim Sillars and Labour's senior Scottish researcher, Alex Neil, officially established the Scottish Labour Party (SLP).\nThe formation of the SLP was prompted as a left-wing split from the mainstream Labour Party over distrust about how strong the then Labour government's stated commitment to Scottish devolution was in reality.  Robertson was a leading figure in the SLP, along with Sillars, but unlike Sillars he stood down at the 1979 general election, deciding not to contest his Paisley seat. The Scottish Labour Party was officially disbanded in 1981, after failing to win any seats at the 1979 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scottish Labour Party (1976)", "response": ["The party formed on 18 January 1976 as a breakaway from the UK Labour Party, by members disaffected with the then Labour Government's failure to secure a devolved Scottish Assembly, as well as with its social and economic agenda. The formation of the SLP was led by Jim Sillars, then MP for South Ayrshire, John Robertson, then MP for Paisley and Alex Neil, the UK Labour Party's senior Scottish researcher."]}, {"page": "John
