Creighton became a huge influence in the Wrexham side during the 2010/2011 season and played in the side that lost to Luton Town in the Conference Premier play-off semi-finals. In the 2011/2012 season Creighton again proved to be influential in the Wrexham defence playing a part in breaking the club record for the most clean sheets in a row for the club; goalkeeper Joslain Mayebi gave credit to his regular defence (Nathaniel Knight-Percival, Neil Ashton and Chris Westwood). Creighton played in massive matches for the Dragons during the 2011/2012 season including the FA Cup 3rd Round draw away to Brighton & Hove Albion and in the replay back at The Racecourse which Wrexham lost on penalties. He also took part in another play-off semi-final against Luton, which Wrexham lost for a second year running. In February 2012 Creighton signed a new two-year deal to keep him at the Racecourse until 2014. Creighton continued a successful pre-season into the 2012/2013 season, scoring against Woking on the first day of the season in a 3\u20131 win. But just three matches into the season he picked up a season-ending injury 6 minutes into an away match at Ebbsfleet United. During his time off the pitch Creighton set up his own business, Raw Ink Tattoo studio in nearby Coedpoeth. As well as his tattooing business Creighton also joined Welsh Premier League side Bala Town FC as a voluntary coach in January 2013. Creighton returned from injury on the final day of the 2012/2013 season in a match away to Mansfield Town. He took part in the following pre-season and started the first game of the 2013/2014 season against Welling United. His second game of the season came in the cross border derby against Chester, but in the first half he picked up another injury setting himself back once again. He returned from injury once again in a 1\u20133 loss away to his former club Kidderminster, coming on as a sub for Robert Ogleby in the 84th minute. He went on to play further games against Dartford FC and Forest Green Rovers, coming on as a sub in both matches.
