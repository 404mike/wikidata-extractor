H. Mackmurdo and William Morris's Kelmscott Press, Ricketts and Shannon set up a small press over which, according to the critic Emmanuel Cooper, Ricketts exercised complete control of design and production.Osborne, p. 656 He told Lucien Pissarro that he intended \"to do for the book something in the line of what William Morris did for furniture\".Watry, p. xxiii Cooper writes that Ricketts designed founts, initials, borders and illustrations for the press, \"blending medieval, Renaissance and contemporary imagery\". His woodcut illustrations \"often incorporated the swirling lines of Art Nouveau and androgynous figures\". The Vale Press, which existed between 1896 and 1904, published more than eighty volumes, mostly reprints of English poetic classics, and earned a reputation as \"one of the big six amongst modern presses\". Initially, Ricketts financed the Vale publications by inviting subscriptions, but in 1894 its finances were put on a more secure footing when he was introduced to a rich barrister, William Llewellyn Hacon, who invested \u00a31,000 and became Ricketts's business partner in the firm. A fire at the printers in 1904 destroyed the press's woodcuts, and Ricketts and Shannon decided to abandon publishing and turn to other work. They closed the Vale Press and threw the type into the river.Darracott, p. 8 Ricketts marked the demise of the press by publishing a complete bibliography of its publications.Ricketts (1904), passim  Thereafter, he occasionally designed books for friends such as Michael Field (the joint pen name of Katherine Harris and Emma Cooper) and Gordon Bottomley."]}, {"page": "Tupton Hall School", "response": ["* Emmanuel Cooper, potter"]}, {"page": "List of studio potters", "response": ["This is a list of notable studio potters.
