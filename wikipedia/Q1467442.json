Although the Sisters of St Margaret had by now for some years been associated with the running of the school, it was now with this shift that the school was passed into their care. Proximity to St Margaret's Convent at Polwatte was of great significance. For an unbroken period of sixty years from 1895 to 1955 these sisters guided the students of Bishop's College: not only in their mental development, but in the levels of charity, community spirit and public service, and upholding of the school motto \"Non Sibi Sed Omnibus\" (Not for Self, but for All)."]}, {"page": "Diocese of Calcutta (Church of North India)", "response": ["| Reginald Copleston"]}, {"page": "Anglican Bishop of Colombo", "response": ["|Reginald Copleston "]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the Oxford Union", "response": ["| align=\"center\" |12px Reginald CoplestonFoster, p. 487.", "| align=\"center\" |12px Reginald Copleston (iterum)"]}, {"page": "Reginald Stephen Copleston", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald Copleston"]}, {"page": "Index of Sri Lanka\u2013related articles (Q\u2013R)", "response": ["# Reginald Copleston"]}, {"page": "Ancient Classics for English Readers", "response": ["*\u00c6schylus, 1871, By the Right Rev.
