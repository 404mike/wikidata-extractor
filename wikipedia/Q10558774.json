He was appointed captain, played at centre half in the club's first Football League fixture, a 2\u20130 win away to Wrexham, and continued as a regular selection. He missed a few weeks with influenza in early 1922, and despite a rumour that he was about to leave the club, he was ever-present for the rest of the season. Hopkins played regularly for the first half of the 1922\u201323 season before losing his place to Walker Hampson, and he was listed for transfer at a fee of \u00a350. However, when another Third Division club, Durham City approached Hartlepools United, the directors agreed to let Hopkins leave on a free transfer. A pre-season profile suggested that the Durham club, whose financial situation meant their playing staff was about 80% amateur, were signing \"the right sort\" of professional player, which included the \"experienced and clever\" Hopkins. He missed only four league matches during the 1923\u201324 season, and scored three goals. He was appointed player-coach for 1924\u201325, and although he lost his place as first-team centre half to Joe Robson, he continued to contribute as coach and reserve-team player until the end of the season, at which point, at the age of nearly 37, he retired from playing."]}, {"page": "Jack Burnham (footballer)", "response": ["Burnham returned to his native north-east of England and signed for Third Division North club Durham City in July 1923. He occupied the right-half position during the first half of the season, but lost his place to new arrival Joe Robson and rarely regained it. At the end of the campaign, he moved on to Scunthorpe & Lindsey United of the Midland League, where he spent two years before returning to Durham City in 1926. As backup to John Gurkin at centre half, he rarely appeared, and went back to non-league football with West Stanley and Jarrow."]}]}}
