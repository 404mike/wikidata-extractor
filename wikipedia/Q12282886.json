Wolfram, an Oxford University philosophy lecturer in her early thirties, fell out with L\u00e9vi-Strauss over criticisms he made of early drafts of the first two chapters. She almost left the project at this point, but the publishers persuaded her to complete the translation. When she handed in the script, L\u00e9vi-Strauss was damning: \"I could not recognise my book as she had rendered it\", he complained in a letter to the journal Man. For her part, Wolfram disassociated herself from the heavily edited version of her work that finally appeared in print, which she felt was \"full of howlers, pieces of sheer nonsense, ungrammatical sentences, extreme infelicities, pointless substitutions, often resulting in absurdity and inaccuracy, the loss of allusions I have carefully preserved\". The Pl\u00e9iade edition reproduces excerpts from a letter in which Wolfram accused L\u00e9vi-Strauss of having \"an inadequate knowledge of English\", and labelled philosophical terms like \"\u00eatre\" and \"devenir\" used as substantives as \"meaningless metaphysical expressions\". \"If you do not mean what I put, then I do not understand what you mean\", wrote an exasperated Wolfram.\" She was the daughter of criminologist and psychoanalyst Kate Friedlander (1902\u20131949), an expert on the subject of juvenile delinquency,The Psycho-Analytical Approach to Juvenile Delinquency: Theory, Case Studies, Treatment by Kate Friedlander, 1998[1947]. and the physician Walter Misch (1889\u20131943) who, together, wrote Die vegetative Genese der neurotischen Angst und ihre medikament\u00f6se Beseitigung.Kate Friedl\u00e4nder n\u00e9e Frankl (1902-1949), Psychoanalytikerinnen.
