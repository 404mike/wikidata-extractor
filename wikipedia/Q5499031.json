Following the side's promotion to the First Division for the 1906\u201307 season, he played only sparingly. In July 1907 he returned to the Second Division, joining Burnley on a free transfer. Beddow played his first competitive game for his new club in the first match of the 1907\u201308 season, a 0\u20135 defeat away to West Bromwich Albion. The following week, he scored twice as Burnley secured a 3\u20131 win against Stoke at Turf Moor. After losing his place in the team for a short period, Beddow netted twice on his return as Burnley won 3\u20132 away at Barnsley on 19 October. During November, he scored in consecutive matches against Grimsby Town and Oldham Athletic. However, he was dropped for the game against Stockport County on 14 December in favour of young William Short, making his senior debut. Beddow did not appear again for Burnley that season, unable to displace first Alex Leake and later Frederick Whittaker from the starting eleven.Simpson (2007), p. 109"]}]}}
