Arming himself with a rifle and hand grenade he started to crawl towards his objective, and when he had advanced about 100 yards another soldier came forward to give covering support. Although wounded, he pushed on to the blockhouse, threatened the machine-gun teams inside with a hand grenade and forced them to surrender. This action resulted in the capture of 36 prisoners, six machine-guns and one trench mortar.He was also awarded the French Croix de Guerre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|William Henry Grimbaldeston || British Army || 1917 || First World War || Wijdendrift"]}]}}
