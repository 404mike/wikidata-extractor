He has led a number of UK-wide surgical randomized Clinical trials. With colleagues in Oxford he pioneered the involvement of patients in assessing the outcome of orthopaedic operations and has invented a series of patient reported outcome measures (PROMS). The Oxford Scores are now used worldwide in clinical trials and by national joint replacement registries.

In 2008 he led the amalgamation of orthopaedics, rheumatology and musculoskeletal sciences to form a new department at Oxford University. In 2011, the department incorporated the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology when it moved from Imperial College, London to the University of Oxford.\nProfessor Carr was appointed founder Director of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit (BRU) in Oxford in 2008 and, in 2011, became Divisional Director of the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre section of the newly formed Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust.
