His father was one of the early defenders of Ibadan against the Ijebu incursions of the late nineteenth century. He was rewarded with a chieftaincy title for his effort in defending Ibadan.Karin Barber. Africa's Hidden Histories: Everyday Literacy and Making the Self. Indiana University Press, 2006, p. 56.  He also acquired a vast forest during the period.", "Obisesan attended various schools managed by the Church Missionary Society. The missionary school teachers were educated and frequently wrote about their activities in journals. One of the missionaries was Daniel Olubi, an early Christian convert who was Obisesan's teacher in 1896, the first year of his formal education.Karin Barber p. 56. Olubi was a mentor to Obisesan and guided him in his studies. Obisesan's impetus to keep a journal could have been established while attending the missionary schools. After completing his studies, he started work at the office of the British resident in Ibadan, but later moved to Lagos to work with the railway authority. In 1913, he returned to Ibadan and a year later, he was appointed as the caretaker and secretary of his family's land holdings. His father had used his vast forest to farm and transformed it into a productive Cocoa growing field. However, the ownership of the land was disputed, as other citizens laid claims to the land. In 1914, he bought in first diary, speculatively, he may have used his diary as a means to record events on the family's farm business or for record keeping.", "Obisesan was educated in an environment were literary skills was seen as a sign of intellectual fineness and with most missionaries situated in Lagos and Abeokuta,Karin Barber p. 60. the school age residents of the two cities had a fast start in literacy and honing their writing skills. He also believed literacy could be a ticket to acquire wealth and without education, Ibadan may be left behind. He desired writing as a way to educate himself and record keeping was a productive way of keeping himself abreast of developments in his business. In his diaries, fingerprints of his emulation of status men and being enthralled with wealth at an early age could be seen. At an early age, he dreamt about having a fecund future, however, the reality of his poor financial position was always something he moaned and wrote about early on. During his early years when he was suffering from financial deprivation, Akinpelu wrote in his diary, ", "In 1920, when he started writing assiduously, it was a means of self-education and self-development.Karin Barber p. 62. Contents in his diary revealed different information about the social personalities and events of the era, it also revealed personal details of his life.
