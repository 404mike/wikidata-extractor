This production emphasised the physical brutality of the taming, with a macho Lockhart often aggressively lashing out at  Scardifield, who began as a punk rebel, but who became less and less assertive as the play went on. Katherina's final speech was delivered in a manner suggesting she was terrified of disagreeing with Petruchio."]}]}}
