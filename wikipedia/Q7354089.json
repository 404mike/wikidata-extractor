However, when a British team (Francis Thompson, Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire) came in 1888 to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory, he was wary about entering into negotiations. Lobengula gave his agreement only when his friend, Leander Starr Jameson, a qualified medical doctor who had once treated Lobengula for gout, proposed to secure money and weaponry for the Matabele in addition to a pledge that any people who came to dig would be considered as living in his kingdom. As part of this agreement, and at the insistence of the British, neither the Boers nor the Portuguese would be permitted to settle or gain concessions in Matabeleland. Lobengula sent two emissaries to the British queen, Victoria. However, they were delayed by Alfred Beit's associates at the port. The 25-year Rudd Concession was signed by Lobengula on 30 October 1888."]}, {"page": "Teshekpuk Lake", "response": ["Its name comes from the I\u00f1upiaq language Tasiqpak, recorded by Rochfort Maguire as Tasok-poh in 1854, and reported to mean \"big lagoon\", \"big enclosed coastal water\" or \"big coastal lake\".\"Cold Regions Lake and Landscape Research: Teshekpuk Lake Observatory.\" USGS Alaska Science Center.
