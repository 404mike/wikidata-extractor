Artistic director Indhu Rubasingham said that the new name helped strengthen the venue's association with the Kilburn area and that kilns also have a relationship with all cultures around the world, and are symbols of creativity and culture. Following this, a public petition was launched arguing that the name change was \"unnecessary, costly and squanders the established reputation of The Tricycle\". As of July 2018 the petition was reported to have received over 2,000 signatures. The theatre received public support from various industry professionals, including an open letter in The Guardian from actors Jim Carter and Imelda Staunton and articles from critics Lyn Gardner and Matt Trueman, as well as arts writer Jessie Thompson. In September 2018 The Stage published an open letter in support of Kiln Theatre, including signatures from Richard Bean, Moira Buffini, Dominic Cooke, David Eldridge, Rebecca Lenkiewicz, Simon Stephens and Erica Whyman."]}, {"page": "National Student Drama Festival", "response": ["* Erica Whyman"]}, {"page": "Marina Carr", "response": ["|Erica Whyman"]}, {"page": "Jo Stone-Fewings", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|2002 ||The Shadow of a Boy||Shadow|| Erica Whyman||NT Loft"]}, {"page": "Southwark Playhouse", "response": ["Over the next fifteen years the theatre established itself as one of London's leading studio theatres, presenting high quality work by new and emerging theatre practitioners.
