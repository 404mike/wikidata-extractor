He is currently the owner of Football Superleague of Kosovo side Ferizaj. His most recent managerial position was as the manager of the Norwegian side Sarpsborg 08.\nDuring his playing career, he played as forward from 1985 until 2006. He was the scorer of the first ever goal in the FA Premier League in 1992, when he was a Sheffield United player. Deane also played in the Premier League for Leeds United and Middlesbrough as well as playing top-flight football in Portugal and Australia for Benfica and Perth Glory respectively. He also played in The Football League for Doncaster Rovers, Leicester City (scoring another first goal, this time the first competitive goal at the new Walkers Stadium), West Ham United and Sunderland before finishing his playing career in 2006 with a brief spell back at Sheffield United.

Reading and their chairman, John Madejski, however, were reluctant to let him leave. After serving a period of notice and gardening leave, and with West Ham paying Reading \u00a3380,000 in compensation, he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003, their tenth manager. Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo-Coker, Marlon Harewood and Brian Deane. In his first season in charge, they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace. His signings of Bobby Zamora, Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat Preston North End 1\u20130 thanks to a Zamora goal in the 2005 playoff final, securing a return to the Premier League.

Edwards was in a meeting with manager Alex Ferguson at the time, and both agreed that Irwin was not for sale. Ferguson had identified that his team was in need of a striker, having recently made unsuccessful bids for David Hirst, Matt Le Tissier and Brian Deane, and instructed his chairman to ask whether Cantona was for sale. Fotherby had to consult with Wilkinson, but within a few days the deal was complete."]}, {"page": "Ian Wright", "response": ["Taylor, who became England manager after the 1990 World Cup in Italy and remained in charge for 38 matches, only handed Wright nine starts and seven substitute appearances. He opted instead to use a whole host of less prolific strikers, including Nigel Clough of Nottingham Forest, Paul Stewart of Tottenham Hotspur, David Hirst of Sheffield Wednesday and Brian Deane of Sheffield United. Wright did not make it into the squad for Euro 1992, with Clough, Gary Lineker of Tottenham Hotspur, Alan Shearer of Southampton and Arsenal teammates Alan Smith and Paul Merson preferred.

United were the first club in English football to achieve promotion from the newly formed Second Division to the First Division in 1892\u201393. The club was also a founder member of the Premier League in the 1992\u201393 season, during which they scored the first ever goal of the competition; Brian Deane was the first scorer in a 2\u20131 win at Bramall Lane against Manchester United.

The club changed its name from the Perth Glory Soccer Club to the Perth Glory Football Club with a new logo being unveiled at a season launch in February. The 2005\u201306 season saw a complete overhaul of the playing squad, with Simon Colosimo and former Sunderland and Leeds striker Brian Deane as key signings. Other notable signings included future young stars Nick Ward and Billy Celeski. Early results in friendlies against local opposition were not great, but Perth became the first team to defeat Sydney FC, winning 1\u20130 in the semi-final of the 2005 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup before losing in the final 0\u20131 to the Central Coast Mariners. Perth's woeful recruiting strategy was soon evident with the early departure of star import Brian Deane after seven games. Another McMahon recruit, Northern Ireland junior international Neil Teggart, quit the club prior to the start of the regular season. Deane was replaced by Damian Mori, a former Perth Glory striker. Originally on a three-game temporary contract, after some impressive performances Mori stayed for the rest of the season and finished with seven goals. However, the club continued to be dogged by problems which would only be later revealed to the public. Steve McMahon was subject to constant media criticism over his coaching style and was accused of nepotism by signing his son, Steve McMahon Jr, who was of questionable talent. Rumours also surfaced that players were planning to stage a revolt against the coach. On 7 December, the club reported that the parties had \"amicably\" chosen to go separate ways. On 9 December 2005, the club announced that assistant coach Alan Vest would move into the head coach role for the remainder of the season, with striker Damian Mori taking on a dual role as player-coach after being named as his assistant. The coach's departure was merely a symptom of deeper troubles. Poor performances saw Perth miss out on qualification for the finals for the first time since 1998. Dwindling support from chairman Nick Tana, as he looked to sell his 75 percent stake in the club, seemed to underpin a general decline in club fortunes. After the Round 20 match against Sydney FC, Alan Vest hinted that the current player group were incapable of achieving anything better and stated that \"cliques\" had been formed undermining club harmony. To cap off a bad season, Western QBE announced they were withdrawing as major sponsor after being associated with the club for 8 years."]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 FA Premier League", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Brian Deane"]}, {"page": "Albert Johanneson", "response": ["In January 2019 Leeds United and Leeds Civic Trust unveiled a blue plaque commemorating Johanneson, his contribution to football and the city of Leeds.

He continued, briefly, as a regular starter playing in a 2\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers on 27 December, in which he scored his second goal for the club.

However, when Brian Deane was sold to Leeds United during the 1993 close season, without him the Blades struggled. Bassett's luck finally ran out on the last day of the 1993\u201394 season. Needing a single point to avoid relegation, they lost 3\u20132 at Chelsea, having led 2\u20131 with 5 minutes remaining. An eighth-place finish in the 1994\u201395 Division One campaign was not enough for a play-off place, and Bassett resigned the following December with relegation looking more likely than promotion and protests against the board mounting."]}, {"page": "David Healy (footballer)", "response": ["Aiming for a move away from Deepdale, Healy got his wish in October 2004, as he was signed by Leeds United for a \u00a3650,000 fee.

During his time at Elland Road he was linked with dozens of moves to other clubs, the most notable rumour reported in the press being a potential \u00a33 million move to Manchester City. He again finished as joint top scorer in the 2005\u201306 season, both he and Rob Hulse on fourteen goals. Leeds reached the play-off finals this season but lost in the final 3\u20130 to Watford.

The first victory of the league season came at the fourth attempt when a late goal by Dublin gave them a 1\u20130 win at Southampton, but Dublin then broke his leg in the next game against Crystal Palace and was sidelined for sixth months. Some decent results including wins over Leeds United and Nottingham Forest followed, but by late October United had endured a run of five successive draws and the all too familiar goal shortage was attributed to this once again. Defeats against Wimbledon and Ron Atkinson's Aston Villa saw United occupy 10th place in the league by 7 November 1992, with one of the lowest goal tallies in the division. Over the next couple of weeks, United were linked with moves for some of the most highly regarded strikers in the English league, including Brian Deane and David Hirst, but on 26 November 1992 United made a \u00a31.1\u00a0million move for French striker Eric Cantona, who had helped Leeds United win the previous season's league title. The arrival of Cantona helped transform United's fortunes, and by the turn of 1993 they were looking like title contenders again. Despite challenges from Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers and surprise contenders Norwich City, United went on a storming run during the final weeks of the season to win the title by a 10-point margin and end their 26-year wait. United were actually confirmed as champions without kicking a ball, when on 2 May 1993 their last remaining contenders Aston Villa surprisingly lost 1\u20130 at home to unfancied Oldham Athletic, who had given United a serious challenge in the FA Cup semi-finals three seasons earlier and would do so again the following season."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 A-League", "response": ["|  Brian Deane"]}, {"page": "Andy Gray (footballer, born 1977)", "response": ["After failing to displace the likes of Tony Yeboah, Rod Wallace, Brian Deane and then Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Gray had a loan spell at Bury to get regular first team football before leaving the club permanently in 1998."]}]}}
