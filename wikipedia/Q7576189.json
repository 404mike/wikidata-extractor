Michael Heseltine and his wife Anne bought the house and 400 acres of gardens and farmland from Sir Spencer's widow in 1976, and moved into the house in 1977. Since that time, the Heseltines have developed the house and the estate, most notably by the planting of an important arboretum. A summerhouse, dating from 1981\u20131982 is by Quinlan Terry."]}]}}
