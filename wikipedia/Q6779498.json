As \"Thomasine of the Nation\" she contributed prose, poems, and verse translations, in keeping with the Nation's nationalist tone. The themes of her poetry were emigration, separation, exile, alongside hope and religious faith. Knight's translations were primarily works of fiction, such as short stories in historical settings and contemporary fables on relevant topics including freedom of speech. These were mostly from French, and were published in the 1850s. Her translations were also published in James Duffy's magazines. During the period that Knight wrote for the Nation, she interacted with Mary Eva Kelly, who was known as \"Eva of the Nation\"."]}, {"page": "List of Irish women writers", "response": ["*Mary Eva Kelly (1826\u20131910), poet, emigrated to Australia"]}, {"page": "Mary Eva O'Doherty", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary Eva Kelly"]}, {"page": "Eva Kelly", "response": ["#Redirect Mary Eva Kelly"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (A\u2013L)", "response": ["*Mary Eva Kelly (1826\u20131910, Ireland/Australia), poet & es."]}]}}
