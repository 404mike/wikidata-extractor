He competed in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix. James was an engineer who acquired a Maserati 4CLT/48, and entered the 1951 British Grand Prix, retiring from a damaged radiator after 23 laps. Regulation changes for 1952 limited his Maserati to competing in Formula Libre only, and he competed in several sprint races before retiring from racing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1951 British Grand Prix", "response": ["The Maserati of John James became the first retirement of the race on lap 23 with a radiator problem, but was soon joined on the sidelines by Louis Chiron, both his Maserati teammates, the Ferrari of Alberto Ascari and Farina. Farina pulled up at Abbey curve after 75 laps with a slipping clutch and his engine on fire. He had set the lap record on lap 38, with a time of 1 minute 44 seconds, an average speed of 99.99\u00a0mph, ensuring he still left the weekend with one point. Gonz\u00e1lez retook the lead on lap 39 with an overtake at Becketts corner. He kept his lead for the remainder of the race (excluding one lap when he pitted just before Fangio did) extending it to 1 minute and 5 seconds with 5 laps to go, before easing off at the end of the race.
