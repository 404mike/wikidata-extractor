Although he coveted a peerage and spent a fortune in pursuit of that aim, he had to be content with a baronetcy.\nLloyd claimed descent from ancient Welsh families and placed great emphasis on these connections. He rebuilt Bronwydd as a Victorian Gothic fantasy 1853\u20131856. The house is now a ruin, in the process of clearance. Lloyd restored the old castle at Newport, Pembrokeshire as a seat for his Marcher Lordship of Cemais and Llangynllo Church.

It is just south of Llangynllo/Llangunllo, halfway between Cardigan and Lampeter. Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet rebuilt the original 18th-century house in the Gothic Revival style in the 1850s. The family sold the house in 1937 after the death of Sir Thomas' son and daughter-in-law; after World War II the house was stripped of its fittings and has been left in ruins.", "Bronwydd replaced Cilrhiwe as the main family home in the 1850s, at which time it was rebuilt in the fashionable gothic revival style by Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet. The architect was Richard Kyrke Penson, who skillfully adapted an existing 18th-century house to create an elaborate Victorian gothic \"castle\" suitable for the \"Marcher Lord\" of Cemais. The 18th-century house contained a private chapel, the Lloyds of that era having been converts to Methodism, while the reconstructed Bronwydd included a baronial hall, containing the family muniments and serving as entrance hall. The exterior of the building included a tall, slim round tower and a square tower with bell-turret. Part of the house is supposed to have been modelled on the cathedral transept and tower of the Rock of Cashel, Ireland, although Thomas Lloyd described the whole as 'a romantic Rhineland castle with patterned roof-tiling.' The stables and service block were rendered in mock half-timber, similar to the streets of Chester. The house was sited on a bluff overlooking the river Afon Cynllo."]}, {"page": "Marteine Lloyd", "response": ["The son of Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet, he was educated at Eton College and afterwards by a private tutor. He inherited the Bronwydd estate in 1877, at the age of twenty-six, on the death of his father. The total debt facing the young squire was \u00a3100,000, several million in today's terms. While Lloyd made good progress towards paying off these debts, he never entirely succeeded, and the death of his only son and heir, Marteine Arundel Keymes Lloyd at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, rendered the actions a moot point. He married, in 1878, Katherine Helena, daughter of Alexander Dennistoun of Golfhill, Glasgow. As well as a son, the couple had three daughters, Nesta, Peverel and Joan."]}, {"page": "1820s in Wales", "response": ["**21 May \u2013 Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet, politician and landowner (d. 1877)"]}, {"page": "1820 in Wales", "response": ["*21 May \u2013 Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet, politician and landowner (d. 1877)"]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Davies Lloyd, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Thomas Lloyd", "response": ["* Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet (1820\u20131877), Welsh politician"]}]}}
