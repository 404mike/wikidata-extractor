Although he coveted a peerage and spent a fortune in pursuit of that aim, he had to be content with a baronetcy.\nLloyd claimed descent from ancient Welsh families and placed great emphasis on these connections. He rebuilt Bronwydd as a Victorian Gothic fantasy 1853\u20131856. The house is now a ruin, in the process of clearance. Lloyd restored the old castle at Newport, Pembrokeshire as a seat for his 'Marcher Lordship' of Cemais and Llangynllo Church. His chivalric fantasies left the estate deeply in debt.", "link_mentions": {}}}
