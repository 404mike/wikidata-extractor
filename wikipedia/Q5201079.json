PPI interfaces are dynamic and frequently planar, although they can be globular and protruding as well. Based on three structures \u2013 insulin dimer, trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex, and oxyhaemoglobin \u2013 Cyrus Chothia and Joel Janin found that between 1,130 and 1,720 \u00c52 of surface area was removed from contact with water indicating that hydrophobicity is a major factor of stabilization of PPIs. Later studies refined the buried surface area of the majority of interactions to 1,600\u00b1350 \u00c52. However, much larger interaction interfaces were also observed and were associated with significant changes in conformation of one of the interaction partners. PPIs interfaces exhibit both shape and electrostatic complementarity."]}, {"page": "Michael Levitt", "response": ["Levitt was one of the first researchers to conduct molecular dynamics simulations of DNA and proteins and developed the first software for this purpose. He is currently well known for developing approaches to predict macromolecular structures, having participated in many Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competitions, where he criticised molecular dynamics for inability to refine protein structures.CASP participants usually did not try to use MD to avoid \"a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure\",  He has also worked on simplified representations of protein structure for analysing folding and packing, as well as developing scoring systems for large-scale sequence-structure comparisons. He has mentored many successful scientists, including Mark Gerstein and Ram Samudrala.
