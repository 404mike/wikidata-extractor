The season ended in controversial circumstances at Villa Park, and with a 3\u20132 defeat to Aston Villa ending any hopes of winning the league, Sandy Turnbull and Villa captain Alex Leake exchanged blows. The Football Association launched an investigation into the violence, and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the 1905\u201306 season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake. No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and the evidence was not made public. The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign. He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road. The FA acted on his information, and fined Manchester City \u00a3900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players, boardroom members and staff members.", "In May 1906, while still serving his ban, Meredith moved to Manchester United. He joined on a free transfer and received a \u00a3500 signing-on fee from United; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match, and he was willing to forego on the agreement if the club instead granted his transfer. He returned from suspension on 1 January 1907, and marked his debut at Bank Street with an assist for Sandy Turnbull to score the only goal of the game against Aston Villa. In addition to Turnbull, Meredith was joined at United by former City teammates Jimmy Bannister and Herbert Burgess. This new forward line made the team into a powerful force, as they already possessed a dominant half-back line in captain Charlie Roberts, Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell. They ended the 1906\u201307 season in eighth place in the First Division.", "Manager Ernest Mangnall signed Jimmy Turnbull, and the forward line of Meredith, Bannister, Jimmy Turnbull and Sandy Turnbull were dominant in the 1907\u201308 campaign. United won the title with a nine-point margin over second-placed Aston Villa, and secured the 1908 FA Charity Shield (the first ever Charity Shield) with a 4\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge.", "United slipped to a disappointing 13th-place finish in 1908\u201309. Meredith was suspended for the month of January in punishment for kicking a Brighton & Hove Albion player in an FA Cup match. The club reached the 1909 FA Cup Final, knocking out Brighton, Everton, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley and Newcastle United. Their cup final opponents at Crystal Palace were Bristol City, captained at centre-half by Billy Wedlock \u2013 England captain and staunch opponent of the Players' Union. A Sandy Turnbull goal settled the tie, which was described as quite a boring game; Meredith himself dismissed reports of the match, stating \"it was a good game for dashing, keen, thrilling football, great goalkeeping and narrow escapes at either end\". Meredith and his teammates celebrated the victory with music hall stars such as George Robey."]}, {"page": "Ernest Mangnall", "response": ["Mangnall was hired as the third secretary of Manchester United and the second after the club changed its name from Newton Heath (the term 'manager' was not used at United until the arrival of Jack Robson).

With two First Division titles, one FA Cup and two Charity Shield trophies, he remains the third most successful manager at the club.List of Manchester United F.C. managers#Statistics He started his management at Manchester United in 1903 and saw his team narrowly miss promotion in his first two seasons before success at the third attempt, as the club finished as runners-up in the Second Division. In the first season in the First Division the club finished in mid-table. However, in only their second season in the First Division, he managed United to their first ever League Championship in 1907\u201308 by a nine-point margin over Aston Villa. The following year saw United drop below mid-table but the club won its first FA Cup with a 1\u20130 victory in the final against Bristol City, the winner scored by Sandy Turnbull. The following season saw no new silverware but the team improved its league position to fifth. In the 1910-11 season the club were champions again, beating Aston Villa into second place by just one point; it would be club's last league championship for over 40 years \u2013 its longest ever run without a league title.

In 1906, in the wake of a scandal regarding players' wages, Manchester City were forced into selling most of their players, and Burgess was purchased by Manchester United along with Sandy Turnbull, Jimmy Bannister and Billy Meredith. After helping the club to the 1907\u201308 Football League title, Burgess left the club and moved to Denmark to play for Kristiania. He then emigrated to Hungary, where he played for MTK Budapest, before becoming their manager. In the 1920s, Burgess' managerial career took him to Italy, where he became the manager of Padova.

Mangnall's position as secretary was first filled by T.J. Wallworth, then by Bentley, under whom Robson worked. No football was played during the war, which meant that the club was not generating any revenue, but the club had to continue to pay for the running of Old Trafford, and as such the financial situation worsened.
