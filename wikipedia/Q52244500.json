Her first success as an author came when she entered a short story for a Yorkshire Evening Post competition in 1973, which she won, and she began writing novels professionally in 1975. Allan continued writing well into her 80s, and during her long career published over 40 books. Many of her novels were set in her native county, including a cycle of four stories set in the fictional village of Nydd Beck. Allan described her works as \"not goody-goody books [but] not blow by blow descriptions of sex either.\" Her books have been translated into a number of languages, including Danish and Slovak, and include audio book editions.\nAllan died at the age of 94, on 27 June 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Allan", "response": ["Margaret Allan may refer to:", "*Margaret Allan (racing driver) (1909\u20131998), Scottish motor racing driver and journalist", "*Margaret Allan (romance author) (1922\u20132017), English author of romantic fiction", "*William Thomas Quick (born 1946), American science fiction author who sometimes writes under the pen name Margaret Allan"]}]}}
