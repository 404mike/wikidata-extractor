Born in Potten End, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England, Rubinstein split her childhood between England and Nigeria, moving to Australia in 1973. As well as eight plays, numerous short stories and articles, she has written over 30 books. Her award-winning and hugely popular 1986 debut Space Demons introduced the themes of growing up and fantasy worlds which emerge often in her other writings. Books such as At Ardilla, Foxspell and Galax-Arena all received critical acclaim and multiple awards.\nIn 2001, Rubinstein published Across the Nightingale Floor, the first of the best-selling three-book series Tales of the Otori series under the pseudonym Lian Hearn. The series is set in a fictional island nation resembling feudal Japan and is her first work to reach an adult audience.\nThe name  'Lian', comes from a childhood nickname and  'Hearn' apparently refers to herons which are a prominent theme in the series. It has also been suggested that the surname is most likely borrowed from Lafcadio Hearn; one of the first Western writers to tackle Japanese mythology.\nGillian Rubinstein currently resides in Goolwa, South Australia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Gillian Rubinstein (born 1942) \u2013 Space Demons, Galax-Arena"]}, {"page": "1986 in literature", "response": ["*Gillian Rubinstein \u2013 Space Demons"]}, {"page": "Rubinstein", "response": ["* Gillian Rubinstein (born 1942), English-born Australian author of children's books and for adults as Lian Hearn"]}, {"page": "Lian Hearn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gillian Rubinstein"]}, {"page": "Tales of the Otori", "response": ["Tales of the Otori is a series of historical fantasy novels by Gillian Rubinstein, writing under the pen name Lian Hearn, set in a fictional world based on feudal Japan.

The Guardian regarded the books as a departure from Hearn's earlier writing as Gillian Rubinstein, and commented positively on their density of allusions and focus on \"the intricacies of Japanese society\". In a similar remark, the Australian Book Review said that Hearn's books left its readers \"reflecting on Japaneseness [and] its enduring characteristics\". The violence in the novels was however critiqued by The New York Times, which described the third book Brilliance of the Moon as \"blood-soaked\" and \"a by-the-numbers combat epic\".", "it:Gillian Rubinstein#La Leggenda di Otori"]}, {"page": "Galax-Arena", "response": ["Galax-Arena, by Gillian Rubinstein, is a 1995 science fiction novel following 3 children who are kidnapped by aliens.
