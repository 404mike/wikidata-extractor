Fasach Nua (talk) 17:14, 14 December 2007 (UTC)", ":Also, the Olympic articles use an entirely different set of flag templates.  For example, if you look at Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 10000 metres, the flag icon and wikilink next to Marie Davenport's name (14th place) are generated from .  Notice that the wikilink points to Ireland at the 2004 Summer Olympics, not to Republic of Ireland.  This is probably close to what you are thinking of, as that article mentions the Olympic Council of Ireland (in the infobox, at least).  With respect to Wayne McCullough, I'd suggest replacing  in the medal box with , which will have the same visual appearance but will wikilink to Ireland at the Olympics.  Is that what you are thinking of?", ":The other comment worth mentioning here is that Wikipedia:WikiProject Olympics members have not completely installed the flagIOC set of templates on all past results pages, so if you reach Boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics via the Wayne McCullough medal box, you won't be able to reach Ireland at the 1992 Summer Olympics from the bantamweight results, because we haven't got around to it yet.

I don't think that is in dispute, nor should it be.  Most of the official reports show photographs of each team marching in the opening ceremonies, so there is easily verifiable sources to demonstrate that.  I am not completely certain of Fasach Nua's request, but my interpretation was that the wikilink to Republic of Ireland (via Template:IRL) in the Wayne McCullough article was problematic, which is why I suggested using an existing template to link to Ireland at the Olympics, which should solve the problem.
