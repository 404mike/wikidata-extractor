The first posters were  handmade by the staff of the Golden Grid Fish Restaurant and displayed with the help of the owner John Senior MBE TD, a retired Army Officer who had himself seen active service in Afghanistan during 2001/2002. The idea quickly found support amongst the  Scarborough seafront business community and eventually came to the attention of the Town Mayor who requested that \"Heroes Welcome in Scarborough\"  be formally adopted as good civic practice.", "In May 2008 Scarborough became the first  Heroes Welcome Town, ensuring  that service personnel were offered  a special warm welcome wherever the Heroes welcome logo was displayed.

The Scarborough scheme also won the support of a number of senior military and political  figures, being seen as a simple and appropriate method for a community to show its open support to those serving in the Armed Forces. In March 2009 the  founder, John Senior was invited by the Ministry of Defence, (Armed Forces Day Team) to give a presentation  to members of the National Association of Civic Officers in order that they might better appreciate the benefits of forming  closer relationships  with the Armed Forces community. At the conclusion of the presentation a number of Civic Officers approached Senior wishing to explore the possibilities of joining the Heroes Welcome Scheme, at that time there was no facility or provision for a  wider regional membership within the existing scheme.", "On 29 January 2013 Heroes Welcome In Gibraltar was launched at a ceremony held in the City Hall attended by 120 civil and military invitees .
