This strategy led to some notable by-election performances during 1961\u201362, culminating in March 1962 with victory in Orpington, where a 14,760 Conservative majority was turned into a Liberal majority of 7,855. These results were accompanied by substantial Liberal gains in municipal elections; national opinion polls briefly showed the party on equal terms with the Labour and Conservative parties. This advance was barely reflected in the results of the October 1964 general election; the party nearly doubled its share of the national vote, to 11.2%, but secured a net gain of only two seats. One of the new Liberals was Peter Bessell, who won the Cornish seat of Bodmin. In North Devon, Thorpe increased his personal majority to over 5,000.", "In 1965 Thorpe asked his parliamentary colleague Peter Bessell to help him resolve the problem. Bessell met Scott and warned him that his threats against Thorpe might be considered blackmail; he offered to help Scott obtain a new National Insurance card, the lack of which had been a long-running source of irritation. This quietened matters for a while, but within a year Scott was causing trouble again. With Thorpe's agreement, Bessell began paying Scott a \"retainer\" of \u00a35 a week, supposedly as compensation for the welfare benefits that Scott had been unable to obtain because of his missing card. Bessell later stated that by 1968 Thorpe was considering ways in which Scott might be permanently silenced; he thought David Holmes might organise this. Holmes had been best man at Thorpe's wedding, and was completely loyal to him.", "On 29 January the Department of Trade published its report into the collapse of London & County Securities. The report criticised Thorpe's failure to investigate the true nature of the company before involving himself, \"a cautionary tale for any leading politician\". Thorpe received some relief when his former colleague Peter Bessell, who had resigned from parliament and relocated to California to escape from a string of business failures, re-emerged in early February after discovery by the Daily Mail. Bessell gave muddled accounts of his involvement with Scott, but insisted that his former chief was innocent of any wrongdoing."]}, {"page": "Paul Tyler", "response": ["At the 1970 general election, Tyler stood as the Liberal candidate in the Bodmin constituency, defending the seat held by the outgoing Liberal MP Peter Bessell.

I wasn't originally claiming that Cornwall should be listed with all the countries. I originally put it under the United Kingdom in the brackets with England Scotland and Wales. What I would say though is that the definition given by Fram of what constitutes a country does allow for Cornwall to be included like Wales is. \"A country or territory is a geographical area, either in the sense of nation (a cultural entity) and/or state (a political entity).\" and \"Nation may refer to a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history. However, it can also refer to people who share a common territory and government (for example the inhabitants of a sovereign state) irrespective of their ethnic make-up; that is, a nation state.\" Indeed Cornwall and the Cornish people were referred to as a nation or country during the 16th and 17th century. People who have explicitly referred to Cornwall in such a way include: Thomas Agar-Robartes MP, 1910; Peter Bessell MP and John Pardoe MP, 1967; Charles Lee (author) 1898; D. H. Lawrence; Ludovico Falier, Venetian ambassador, 1531; Girolamo Ruscelli, 1561; George Lily, 1546; Johannes Honter; Polydore Vergil, official historian of Henry VII and VIII; Sebastian M\u00fcnster, 1538; Francis Bacon, 1622; Robert Louis Stevenson; John Betjeman; and A. L. Rowse. There are also the 83,966 who stated their national identity as Cornish in the United Kingdom Census 2011 and the 41% of school children registering their ethnic identity as Cornish in the same year. There are also several thousand people who speak the Cornish language. So there's definitely \"a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history.\" which means that there's a \"nation (a cultural entity)\" which is one of the two definitions of Country that Wikipedia lists.
