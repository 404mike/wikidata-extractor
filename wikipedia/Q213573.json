A soldier by profession, from 1764 to 1803 he was Prince-Bishop of Osnabr\u00fcck in the Holy Roman Empire. From the death of his father in 1820 until his own death in 1827 he was the heir presumptive to his elder brother, George IV, in both the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Kingdom of Hanover.\nFrederick was thrust into the British Army at a very early age and was appointed to high command at the age of thirty, when he was given command of a notoriously ineffectual campaign during the War of the First Coalition, a continental war following the French Revolution. Later, as Commander-in-Chief during the Napoleonic Wars, he oversaw the reorganisation of the British Army, establishing vital structural, administrative and recruiting reforms for which he is credited with having done \"more for the army than any one man has done for it in the whole of its history.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nursery rhyme", "response": ["|Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York in the Wars of the Roses; James II of England, or Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany Flanders campaign of 1794\u201395."]}, {"page": "1827", "response": ["* January 5 \u2013 Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, heir-presumptive to the British throne (b. 1763)"]}, {"page": "1763", "response": ["* August 16 \u2013 Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, second son of George III"]}, {"page": "George IV", "response": ["George's only legitimate child, Charlotte, had died from post-partum complications in 1817, after delivering a stillborn son.

Marriage with the Prince of Orange, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, Charles, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the second son of the Margrave of Baden were all suggested, while her mother and father supported an English and a Prussian Prince respectively, but none came to fruition. Caroline was later to state that her father had forbidden her to marry a man she had fallen in love with because of his low status. The identity of this man is not clear, but contemporaries point out an officer who was referred to at the time as the \"Handsome Irishman\" who lived in Brunswick, and with whom Caroline was said to have been in love. There was also a rumour that Caroline had given birth at the age of fifteen."]}]}}
