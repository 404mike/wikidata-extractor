He played first-class cricket for Somerset from 1993, before moving to Derbyshire in 2001.\nAfter back injury curtailed his career at the end of 2002, Bridgwater Cricket Club appointed Kerr as director of coaching in 2004 to spearhead their West of England Premier League promotion bid. He succeeded Ben Wellington, who resigned in early February 2004 because of his commitments as a full-time coach at Somerset's Centre of Excellence. Kerr returned to Somerset as a self-employed coach in 2005, before taking up the Academy Directors post full-time in February 2006, replacing the ECB bound Kevin Shine. At the end of the 2013 season, Kerr was promoted to the role of First XI bowling coach.In October 2017, following the departure of Director of Cricket Matthew Maynard, Kerr was promoted to head coach of Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club", "response": ["Under new director of cricket Andy Hurry, who returned to the club, and new head coach Jason Kerr, Somerset enjoyed an excellent start to their 2018 Championship campaign, winning three of their first five matches whilst drawing the other two. However, a heavy innings defeat to Surrey in the next round proved to be pivotal, as Surrey would go on to run away with the Championship title winning 10 of their 14 matches. Nonetheless, Somerset themselves won 7 games and only lost twice, but were consigned to yet another runners-up finish. James Hildreth broke the 1000 run barrier, whilst Lewis Gregory and Craig Overton finished with 37 wickets each. Somerset struggled to find consistency in their One-Day Cup campaign, but nevertheless entered the final round of matches with a chance to qualify for a playoff. Despite winning their final game against eventual champions Hampshire, Essex secured the win they needed to reach the playoffs in place of Somerset. The 2018 season saw Somerset take a further step forward in their t20 cricket under new t20 captain Gregory, as they reached finals day for the first time in 6 years. Despite losing two of their first three games, Somerset ended up finishing top of the South Group, winning 10 of their 14 matches to earn a home quarter-final and a chance to exact revenge for the previous year on Nottinghamshire. They were able do so, winning by 19 runs on a reserve day due to the weather, sending them to finals day. There Somerset lost out to Sussex in the semi-final by 35 runs as Sussex were able to put a sizeable score of 202 on the board. The improved performance in the competition was in no small part due to the impact of overseas signings Corey Anderson, who was the team's leading run-scorer with 514 runs at a strike-rate of 169.1, and Jerome Taylor who claimed 22 wickets in his 11 matches. Jamie Overton was Somerset's leading wicket-taker with 24 in his 16 games.", "* Head coach: Jason Kerr"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jason Kerr (1993\u20132001) 58 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Audrish Banerjee", "response": ["Banerjee made an Under-19 Test appearance during the 1992\u201393 season, against England, capturing the wickets of Michael Vaughan and Jason Kerr."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Jason Kerr", "|align=left|Jason Kerr"]}, {"page": "2018 County Championship", "response": ["| Jason Kerr"]}, {"page": "Jason Kerr", "response": ["Jason Kerr may refer to:", "* Jason Kerr (cricketer) (born 1974), English cricketer and coach", "* Jason Kerr (footballer) (born 1997), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2019 County Championship", "response": ["| Jason Kerr"]}, {"page": "2019 Royal London One-Day Cup", "response": ["| Jason Kerr"]}, {"page": "2019 T20 Blast", "response": ["| Jason Kerr"]}, {"page": "2021 County Championship", "response": ["| Jason Kerr"]}, {"page": "2021 T20 Blast", "response": ["| Jason Kerr"]}]}}
