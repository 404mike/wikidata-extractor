He was creator of such series as Secret Army, 1990, Plane Makers and its sequel The Power Game, Hine, Brett, Man At The Top, Man From Haven and The Inheritors. He also wrote the screenplay for the 1969 film Battle of Britain. He was described by The Guardian newspaper as \"one of the most prolific and assured of television script-writers and editors from the 1960s into the 1980s\". Starting off as a journalist, he got his big break as a TV writer on Lew Grade's ATV service writing dramas about journalism, such as Deadline Midnight and Front Page Story. He wrote a number of books, including one about the Battle of Arnhem as ghostwriter for Major General Roy Urquhart.\nAs a TV script editor he also worked on series such as Danger Man and was also creator/producer of The Inheritors, Hine and The Power Game. Papers discovered at a Norfolk auction house in 2011 reveal that 'Hine' had a budget of \u00a384,000, the equivalent of close to \u00a31m some forty years later.\nIn 1977, he came up with the dystopian drama series 1990 for BBC2, starring Edward Woodward. Greatorex dubbed the series \"Nineteen Eighty-Four plus six\". Over its two series it portrayed \"a Britain in which the rights of the individual had been replaced by the concept of the common good \u2013 or, as I put it more brutally, a consensus tyranny.\" The same year he also devised (with Gerard Glaister) the BBC1 wartime drama Secret Army. The show later inspired the sitcom parody 'Allo 'Allo!.When talking about his writing style he said \"I am opposed to soft-centred characters, which is why I don't create a lot of Robin Hoods. The world's full of hard cases, real villains. And they need to be confronted with other characters just as hard.\"His last series for television was Airline in 1982 (starring Roy Marsden).

The programme was based around an on-screen persona of Terry-Thomas as \"a glamorous, mischievous and discreetly cash-strapped man-about-town\", introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside Peter Butterworth as his chauffeur; Janet Brown (Butterworth's real-life wife); Avril Angers; H.C. Walton as the family retainer, Moulting; and Diana Dors. The programme was broadcast live and often included Terry-Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC's Lime Grove and Alexandra Palace studios. The author and historian Mark Lewisohn described the series as being \"inventive\u00a0... truly televisual and not just a radio programme in costume\". The series ran until 21 December 1949; a second series followed between April and May 1950, with Sid Colin taking over the scripting duties and Terry-Thomas providing additional material. By the third series, which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951, the audience reached four million viewers. In total there were five series of How Do You View?; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952. Writing about Terry-Thomas on television, Wilfred Greatorex observed that \"he has\u00a0... physical attributes that make him a gift to visual entertainment: a large, rather gaunt face, pre-fabricated for close-ups; the notorious space of one-third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth; a mouth that is full of expression.
