Lewis' score for the first episode was included on the DVD release."]}, {"page": "Mindwarp", "response": ["Initially it was intended that the BBC Radiophonic Workshop would provide music scores for both this and the following segment of The Trial of a Time Lord; both were assigned to Malcolm Clarke to begin with, although Terror of the Vervoids was reassigned to Elizabeth Parker shortly afterwards. However, fellow Radiophonic Workshop composer Jonathan Gibbs left early in 1986 and was not replaced until the following year, leaving the other composers backlogged and with no one free to do the incidental music for Mindwarp. It was suggested that Dick Mills could provide both the music and sound effects, but John Nathan-Turner rejected this idea and instead hired film composer Richard Hartley to create the incidental music for this segment. It would be the only time that Hartley worked on the series. The original recordings of Hartley's score no longer exist in the BBC archives with the result that there was no isolated score included on the DVD release of this story. For the Blu-Ray release of Season 23, Richard Hartley, along with Mark Ayres re-recorded the entire score in order to present the serial in a new 5.1 mix."]}, {"page": "John Nathan-Turner", "response": ["Nathan-Turner decided on a new broom approach, and instituted sweeping changes: replacing the arrangement of the theme music which had run throughout the 1970s with a more contemporary electronic arrangement by Peter Howell, and introducing revamped opening titles (featuring a new photograph of Baker, replacing the original taken in 1974) and a new closing credit sequence. Nathan-Turner also dispensed with the services of long-time composer Dudley Simpson, who had provided the incidental music for the majority of the Doctor Who serials of the 1970s and all of the Williams era stories. With Simpson departed, the Doctor Who incidental music under Nathan-Turner's stewardship would be provided by a range of electronic composers including Peter Howell, Paddy Kingsland, Malcolm Clarke, Roger Limb, Jonathan Gibbs, Keff McCulloch, and Mark Ayres."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Gibbs", "response": ["Jonathan Gibbs may refer to:", "*Jonathan Gibbs (composer) (fl. 1983\u20131986), British composer for the BBC Radiophonic Workshop between 1983 and 1986", "*Jonathan Gibbs (bishop) (born 1961), area Bishop of Huddersfield in the Church of England Diocese of Leeds", "*Jonathan Gibbs (1975\u20132003), co-pilot of Air Midwest Flight 5481"]}, {"page": "The Soundhouse", "response": ["#Peter Howell, Roger Limb, Jonathan Gibbs, Elizabeth Parker & Dick Mills - \"Radiophonic Rock\"", "#Jonathan Gibbs - \"Computers in the Real World\"", "#Jonathan Gibbs - \"Dawn\"", "#Jonathan Gibbs - \"Houdin's Musical Box\" (composed by Marc-Antoine Charpentier)"]}, {"page": "Doctor Who: The Music II", "response": ["Doctor Who: The Music II is a 1985 BBC Records album which is a sequel to Doctor Who: The Music released in 1983.
