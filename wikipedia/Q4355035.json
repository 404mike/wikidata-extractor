The character became prominent in the 1990s due to her becoming the landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, and her romantic pairings with brothers Grant (Ross Kemp) and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). In a storyline dubbed Sharongate, Sharon married to Grant, has an affair with Phil, climaxing in 1994 with Grant's discovery of the affair, which remains one of EastEnders highest viewed episodes - the storyline was reinvented in 2018 when Sharon began an affair with Phil's young employee, Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). She was named the best EastEnders character of all time by the Daily Mirror in 2020.  ", "Although Sharon was meant to be fourteen, licensing regulations required the cast actress to be a sixteen-year-old who could \"play down.\"Smith and Holland 1987, p. 123. Holland and Smith were looking for a \"bouncy, attractive, oddly vulnerable young woman\" who would come across as slightly more sophisticated than the character of Michelle Fowler, due to be Sharon's closest peer. Out of the various applicants they had seen, they felt only actress Letitia Dean had all of the qualities they were looking for. As the casting directors were only looking for real East End actors, Dean falsely claimed that she was born and raised in Hackney, east London. The lie paid off and she got the part, clinching the deal because of her laugh, which Holland and Smith have described as \"the dirtiest in the world!\".", "Reflecting on her casting, Dean told the magazine, Woman, in 2005: \"I was 16 when we started filming EastEnders and my contract was initially for eight weeks\u2014none of us had any idea it would go on for so long. I nearly fainted when I saw Wendy Richard [who played Pauline Fowler] for the first time, because she was a really big name and I was in awe of her. Anita Dobson who played Angie Watts, [Sharon's] mum, took me under her wing.\" In the early days of EastEnders, it was in Letitia Dean's contract that she was not allowed to lose any weight.", "As the character progressed into her 20s, she underwent some changes. Colin Brake suggested that, following the discovery of Den's (wrongly identified) body in 1990, it was \"time for Den's princess to grow up\".Brake 1995, p. 84. In 1993, Letitia Dean discussed the evolution of Sharon from teenager to adult: \"She's grown up a lot. Once she got into her stride she got quite strong\u2014not hard, but knew what she wanted.\" Matthew Bayliss, writing for The Guardian, suggested that Sharon developed into a character that was simultaneously \"vamp and victim\", comparing her to another popular soap opera character from ITV's Coronation Street, Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix).", "In 1991, author Hilary Kingsley compared Sharon in adulthood to her mother Angie: \"There's a lot of her mother in Sharon Watts. There is the warm sympathy and the barbed tongue for a kick-off. But Sharon is more sensible than Angie, less likely to fly off the beer handle in The Vic.\" Letitia Dean suggested that Sharon was trying to establish her own personality as landlady of The Vic in 1993, but that she was also taking tips from Angie, whom she \"admired for her strength of character.\" In the 1990s, the producers of EastEnders wanted to take the similarities between Sharon and Angie one step further; they proposed that Sharon would begin drinking gin, the favourite beverage of her alcoholic mother. Dean was opposed to this development and persuaded the producers not to go down this route with Sharon. In 1993, she explained her reasons: \"There was one time they wanted [Sharon] to drink gin because that was Angie's tipple, but I thought that was wrong. Her mother was on a dialysis machine which would have put Sharon off gin for life. She would either follow right behind her or she would make her mind up and say no.

Critics have praised the character's complex progression from teenager to adult, referencing the investment that viewers hold in Sharon, having watched her grow up on-screen. While Sharon's returns to EastEnders have been welcomed by some critics, others received her comebacks as an indication that the show's writers and producers had run out of original ideas.

The song was a modest success, reaching number 12 in the UK singles chart in November 1986.

Their marriage was scripted to be volatile, with Grant resorting to violent displays when things did not go his way and endangering Sharon on numerous occasions due to his criminal dealings.

Sue Dunderdale directed the episode and the performances of McFadden, Kemp and Dean have been described as memorable and filled with high-tension drama.Brake 1995, p. 114. Discussing Sharon's feelings for Phil, Letitia Dean said: \"Phil was always around for Sharon. He seemed to understand her, and Sharon appreciated that. There's always been something between them.\"", "Letitia Dean decided to quit the role of Sharon in 1995, having played the character for over a decade. Dean was not the only original cast member to announce their departure that year; Susan Tully (Michelle Fowler) and Bill Treacher (Arthur Fowler) also quit, leaving just Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler), Adam Woodyatt (Ian Beale), and Gillian Taylforth (Kathy Beale) as the only original cast remaining at that time. Dean, who was aged 26 at the time, has since reflected on her decision to leave, suggesting she went through an identity crisis when she found herself thinking \"who am I? Am I Sharon Watts or am I an actress?\". Sally Vincent, interviewing Dean for The Guardian, surmised: \"it nagged away at [Dean] for ages until she thought, hell, she owed it to herself, and started telling the producers she'd been thinking about trying new things. In those days, they didn't let you off for the odd panto or anything. It was full-time work. She remembers being dithery and apologetic about it, but her feet were itchy and, though she never really wanted to close the door behind her, she talked about going until one day, much to her consternation, [the producers] said all right then, off you go, lots of luck. They didn't ask her to reconsider, so she thought, 'Ooooh, charmin', and off she went.\" Dean added, \"I felt the need to spread my wings and try my hand at other things. I didn't want to feel there were parts out there I hadn't had a chance to play. When I left I felt this mixture of excitement and fear. I went on the last walk with Susan Tully [who played Michelle Fowler] around the Square, talking quietly, and I felt quite sad. But at the same time it felt like the right thing to do.\"", "Den's return aired in September 2003, with Den walking into Sharon's club \"Angie's Den\" (named after her parents) and uttering the greeting \"Hello princess\" to his daughter. Scriptwriter Sarah Phelps, who penned Den's return, has discussed the episodes in the televised documentary EastEnders Revealed: Dirty Den Returns: \"It all had to kick off in Angie's Den because this is the thing that Sharon has built [in] memory of her parents [...] the way she's worshipped them in their death in a way that she couldn't deal with them when they were alive [...] there's a lot of really confused and emotional stuff [for Sharon]\". Letitia Dean has discussed Sharon's reaction to Den's comeback: \"Sharon put her father on such a pedestal, when she found out that he had been alive for all those years and never contacted her\u00a0\u2014 once\u00a0\u2014 it absolutely devastated her, it rocked her world [...] She couldn't believe that he would be so selfish because she was his princess.\" Leslie Grantham suggested that the one person Den loved more than himself was Sharon and that she was the reason he came back to Walford after 14 years. Part of Den's return episodes featured a 20-page scene between Sharon and Den, played out in their former home, The Queen Vic. The director required that this scene be filmed all at once, which Dean has described as daunting but exciting. She believed that the long scene helped build realistic tension greatly because both she and Grantham were so nervous about working together again.", "In August 2005, the BBC announced that both Letitia Dean and Nigel Harman were quitting their roles as Sharon and Dennis, with both due to film their final scenes for a New Year's departure. While Harman's exit was reported as permanent, Dean's was reported as an \"extended break\", with the suggestion being that she would be returning to the soap opera at some unspecified stage. Discussing the departure, Harman said, \"Sharon and Dennis have had such a great run, but what would you do with them next? I could pretty much guarantee we've already done it. It was something that was talked about over a period of time between myself and the producers\"I think it would be weird to have one there without the other and we've taken it as far as we can go. I think [the exit storyline will] be quite juicy but I'm waiting to find out. I'd like it to be a happy storyline, like Sharon and Dennis going off around the world. Although obviously, she'll have to come back on her own going, 'What a [bastard]'.\"", "Despite Sharon discovering that she was pregnant with Dennis's child on Christmas Day 2005, the Rickmans were not given a happy ending. Writers made the decision to kill Dennis in the New Year's Eve episode of 2005. In the episode Dennis fatally stabbed on the Albert Square pavement following a violent altercation with gangster Johnny Allen, having been informed by Phil Mitchell that Johnny had throttled Sharon. The aftermath saw Sharon struggling with her grief and the realisation that she would be bringing her baby up fatherless. Discussing Sharon's grief at Dennis's funeral, Letitia Dean told Inside Soap in 2006 \"It's an incredibly traumatic day for Sharon, she's lost her soulmate. It's especially devastating because she's pregnant, which, as far as she and Dennis were concerned, was a miracle. It's such a bittersweet time. The pain is overwhelming when Sharon sees her husband's coffin [...] Sharon knows that she has to carry on for the baby's sake\u2014it's a part of Dennis she'll have forever, and she takes great comfort in that. As far as Johnny's concerned, though, she wants to see justice done\u2014a job she entrusts to Phil. However, all he's interested in is getting Sharon away from Walford. He's genuinely worried for her welfare, but he's also petrified she'll discover his role in Dennis's death.\" In the storyline, Phil persuades Sharon to leave Walford to stay in America in an episode airing in January 2006.", "Letitia Dean suggested in 2012 that \"Sharon has always had a great fondness for Phil and he has always been there for her. She is very comfortable around him and they have a lot of history between them.\" Although Dean has speculated that Sharon and Phil are not right for each other, she acknowledged the connection between the characters, suggesting they \"know each other inside and out\". She added, \"It was real lust between them back in the day. I don't think she's ever lost that feeling for him and vice versa [...] She likes to think there are no surprises with him but he's also got that edge to him that she's always liked as well. There's a familiarity there and he will help her to feel more settled in life [...] There's always been a deep affection. I think she did love him greatly but when they first got together, when she was married to his brother Grant, that love was never allowed to blossom really. There have always been underlying feelings for him. This is the first time they can really be together properly and honestly and she wants him warts and all [...] She feels safe with Phil, she feels protected and she always has with him, even when they were just friends she always knew he'd be there for her.\"", "Letitia Dean has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Sharon. In 1995, she was nominated in the \"Most Popular Actress\" category at the National Television Awards. Dean was nominated for the \"Best Actress Award\" at the British Soap Awards in 2004, and she was also nominated in the category of \"Best Dramatic Performance\" for \"Den's Return\". At the 2005 Inside Soap awards, Dean was presented with the coveted award for outstanding achievement as homage to her work in EastEnders; at the time of the awards ceremony, she had appeared in EastEnders (on and off) for over 20 years. She was also nominated in the category of Best Couple (shared with Nigel Harman). Dean was nominated for \"Best Actress\" for the Inside Soap Awards 2014. In November 2018, Sharon's pairing with Keanu was nominated for Best Soap Couple at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; they came in ninth place with 4% of the total votes.", "Discussing Sharon's initial exit in 1995, Alison Pearson writing for The Independent felt that the script, which saw Sharon misleading Grant into a reunion, was not in-keeping with the character. She commented, \"In soap, character is destiny, and I have to say that I didn't really believe in Sharon's plan for elaborate revenge on Grant. It was a mechanism for getting actress Letitia Dean her freedom and not true to the nature of the character we had grown to know. You could not fault the central performances, though. Albert Square will be a less rounded place without Sharon.\" Conversely, reporter Matthew Bayliss was positive about the exit stating, \"[Sharon] survived the sort of shunning normally suffered by 13th-century Welsh witches in order to wreak the perfect revenge on Grant, tricking him into publicly proposing to her, just so she could turn him down. Rarely has a character's exit been so satisfying to watch, and it was a homage to Sharon's strengths as a character that she left with so much unfinished business behind her.\"", "Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that the magazine's staff had never been so excited as they were when they heard Sharon was returning in 2012. She said that they were \"dying\" to know which male character Sharon will take an interest in first. Ross Kemp who played Grant Mitchell and Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell expressed pleasure at the return of Sharon and Letitia Dean in 2012, with McFadden suggesting that Letitia's former stint in EastEnders was part of a golden era of the soap opera. He described her return as brilliant.", "Media reporter for The Guardian, Stuart Heritage, was critical about EastEnders' decision to reintroduce Sharon for the third time in 2012, suggesting that it meant that the programme had run out of original ideas. Heritage commented, \"Even Letitia Dean has probably lost count of the times she's left and returned as Sharon. She's spent the last 18 years running away to the United States, only to come back to buy a pub or bury her mum, or to have sex with a Mitchell brother, or the other Mitchell brother, or her own adopted sibling, or to confront her inexplicably twice-dead father. Often Sharon's haircut will imperceptibly change upon her arrival, but everything else\u2014the quivering lip, the worrying breathlessness, the consistent inability to refer to Phil Mitchell as anything other than 'Fiw'\u2014remains the same. This is how it's likely to be this time around, regardless of if anyone actually wants her back or not [...] There are other offenders\u2014Bianca, Janine, Mandy, Grant\u2014but Sharon is the worst, simply because she's so prolific\". Letitia Dean defended her comeback saying, \"I think with any sort of ongoing drama like EastEnders you need old blood, new blood, it just needs a balance.\" Steve McFadden added \"What Letitia is doing is bringing back some history and you can't buy that.

She became well known for her deviousness and \"scheming\", echoing the traits of her husband, with the official EastEnders website characterising her as \"happy to play mind games\" and \"often two steps ahead\" of Den. As part of the Watts family and the last of its major members to have appeared on the show, Chrissie's storylines explored her tumultuous marriage to Den; bonding with his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) and her two half-siblings, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Alice Johnson); conspiring with Den to retake ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; forming a relationship with her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) after Den's murder; attempting to sell the Queen Vic Jake's gangland boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt); being blackmailed by young wayward Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner); and feuding with the rival Mitchell family.
