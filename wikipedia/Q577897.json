In its place now exists Scotland in Union (SIU), Scotland's largest and most active pro-UK campaign. Scotland in Union was launched in March 2015 with the aim of promoting Scotland's place in the UK. People who had supported Better Together in the 2014 referendum set up the campaign as a response to the continued, high-profile push for independence by Scottish nationalists after the referendum result. Initially, the organisation was led by its founder Alastair Cameron, a former Army captain.

She made enormous strides to establish the instrument as a solo and ensemble concert instrument, and there can be no doubt that the status of the harpsichord today owes much to her pioneering efforts. Embarking on a career when early harpsichord repertoire was barely acknowledged, or else relegated to the piano, she resolved to re-connect Baroque keyboard music to the instrument for which it was written; in her own words 'to rid the harpsichord of its museum nature and make it a living instrument.'\" Pamela Nash, \"Celebrating the 85th Birthday of Zuzana Ruzickova\", Sounding Board, June 2013."]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Pamela Nash, Airdrie and Shotts, 2010\u20132015"]}, {"page": "Holytown", "response": ["The current MP is Neil Gray, who was first elected in 2015 for the Scottish National Party, replacing Pamela Nash of The Labour Party.
