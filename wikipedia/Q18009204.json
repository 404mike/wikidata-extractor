Working  out of the studios in South Molton St & Clifford St, Sheridan Barnett & Sheilagh Brown created iconic clothes that were  featured in all the most  influential  fashion magazines & media of the time .(see Sunday Times editorial by  Michael Roberts and Molly Parkin, photographs by Guy Bourdin   6/8/72 ). After a year, they  moved on to join Ossie Clark & Alice Pollock at Quorum, where they created some of the most iconic fashion looks of the decade . They went on, several years later, to creat their own, critically acclaimed, collections under the Jazz label.", "By 1970, Stirling Cooper was producing handbags, belts and accessories that were stocked by the new Bata shoe shop on Oxford Street.

She was among the designers for Stirling Cooper, working subsequently at Coopers and Quorum, before establishing the label Barnett and Brown with Sheridan Barnett.", "When the Stirling Cooper partnership split, Brown moved on with Jeff Cooper and Sheridan Barnett to found Coopers, a high-fashion brand located just off Savile Row. This had its own store, but also retailed through stores such as Miss Selfridge. Two years later, Brown and Barnett took over from Alice Pollock and Ossie Clark as head designers at Quorum. Describing the atmosphere, Brown has said: \"It was every designer's dream job. It was insane, with Alice working on her collection, stark naked on hot days. Crazed models drifted into my studio and drank my cloudy paint water!\"", "Brown's own label designs for Jeffrey Rogers proved so successful that she began designing for its more upmarket Portrait label as well. Brown noted that this was a very different way of working, not least because store buyers had more control over the overall styling and merchandising of garments once they arrived in store, adding: \"The discipline of working within a strict budget is surprisingly exhilarating\". Brown also maintained her own more upmarket label, with outfits costing upwards of \u00a3200, but Brenda Polan said this was a bonus. \"Jeffrey Rogers's masterstroke is that he has made the connection between designer and mass market less tenuous\". In 1984, Brown's designs were exhibited at a British fashion event held at Olympia for international fashion buyers \u2013 described as a \"coming of age\" for the fashion industry \u2013 since all the ready-to-wear designers were under one roof and exhibited so that buyers and journalists could see their work. Others exhibiting included BodyMap, Wendy Dagworthy, Betty Jackson, Roland Klein and Sheridan Barnett.", "Brown's involvement in shaping high fashion's move from elite couture into edgy styles for mass manufacturing \u2013 notably with Stirling Cooper \u2013 was profiled in an interview for the Design Museum's 2009 exhibition Super Contemporary. Her eponymous designs with Sheridan Barnett are included within the archive of the Victoria and Albert Museum.", "* V&A collections: coat, hat and veil by Sheridan Barnett with dress by Sheilagh Brown "]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Rogers", "response": ["In the early 1980s, Rogers had six different labels within the Jeffrey Rogers group. He began more high-fashion and upmarket collaborations, working first with two former Royal College of Art students Meghumi Ohki and Barbara Kennington on the Lumiere brand they had launched in 1977; they had the design background but wanted his input into the business side.  In 1983, he collaborated with Sheilagh Brown, a high-fashion designer who had formerly worked with Stirling Cooper and Sheridan Barnett among others, and was then principal lecturer in fashion at Central Saint Martins. Initially the idea was to give her students the opportunity to design garments for commercial production. This, as described by Rogers, was an abysmal failure, but he liked working with Brown and invited her to design for him. Brown's own label designs proved so successful that she began designing for Jeffrey Rogers' more upmarket Portrait label as well."]}]}}
