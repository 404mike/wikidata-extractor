In 1825 the young Dickens was sent to Wellington House Classical and Commercial Academy where in 1827 he won the Latin prize. It may have been as part of his studies that he first encountered Pliny's ghostly tale.Litvack, Leon Charles Dickens and Victorian Education, The Oxford Reader's Guide to Dickens, Oxford University PressDickens' Life and Times: a brief biography, Queen's University Belfast website However, Dunn states that in his library Dickens had a copy of The Philosophy of Mystery by Walter Cooper Dendy,Dunn, Daisy, Did a terrifying Roman ghost story inspire Charles Dickens to write A Christmas Carol?, The Daily Telegraph, 22 December 2020  published in 1841, two years before Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol.Denny, Walter Cooper, The Philosophy of Mystery, London : Longman, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longmans, 1841 The book also relates Pliny's description of the haunting of the house in Athens, which was bought by the Stoic philosopher Athenodorus, who lived about 100 years before Pliny. Knowing that the house was supposedly haunted, Athenodorus intentionally set up his writing desk in the room where the apparition was said to appear and sat there writing until late at night when he was disturbed by a ghost which came at first to the door and then into the chamber, and who, like Marley, was bound in chains. Pliny wrote to his friend Sura that \"In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of fetters; at first it seemed at a distance, but approached nearer by degrees; immediately afterward a phantom appeared in the form of an old man, extremely meagre and squalid, with a long beard and bristling hair; rattling the gyves on his feet and hands.\"An ancient ghost story by Pliny, History of Yesterday website Athenodorus followed the ghost outside where it indicated a spot on the ground. When Athenodorus later excavated the area, a shackled skeleton was unearthed. The haunting ceased when the skeleton was given a proper reburial."]}, {"page": "Lady Eleanor Holles School", "response": ["* Daisy Dunn, classicist, author, journalist and critic"]}, {"page": "Dunn (surname)", "response": ["*Daisy Dunn (born 1987), English author"]}, {"page": "Daisy (given name)", "response": ["*Daisy Dunn (born 1987), English author, classicist, and critic"]}, {"page": "Ibstock Place School", "response": ["* Daisy Dunn"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of The Courtauld Institute of Art", "response": ["* Daisy Dunn, classicist, author, journalist and critic"]}, {"page": "Christmas University Challenge", "response": ["| Daisy Dunn", "The 2016 series was won by St Hilda's College, Oxford whose team of Fiona Caldicott, Daisy Dunn, Val McDermid and Adele Geras beat the University of Leeds and their team of Louise Doughty, Gus Unger-Hamilton, Kamal Ahmed and Steve Bell."]}, {"page": "A Taste of Greece", "response": ["A Taste of Greece: Recipes, Cuisine & Culture is an illustrated cookbook coordinated by Princess Tatiana of Greece and edited by the food writer Diana Farr Louis.
