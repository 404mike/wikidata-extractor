He made his Nelson debut on 26 August 1922 in the 2\u20136 defeat away at Bradford Park Avenue. On 14 April 1923, he scored his first goal for the club, netting the winner in the 2\u20131 win against Accrington Stanley at Seedhill.Dykes, p. 76 Broadhead missed only two matches during the campaign as the team won the Football League Third Division North to gain promotion to the Second Division for the first time in their history. He did not make the team as regularly in a higher league, and was often second choice left-half behind new signing Leigh Collins. Broadhead found his first-team opportunities highly limited during the 1924\u201325 season. On 21 April 1925, he played his first match in almost a year when he was selected for the 2\u20131 home win over Southport.Dykes, p. 78 He played in the first six games of the following campaign, but was then replaced by Ernie Braidwood and later by Ambrose Harris. After a four-year spell, in which he played total of 66 league matches and scored one goal for Nelson, Broadhead left Nelson in July 1926 to join non-league side Barnoldswick Town."]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Leigh Collins"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["While there were several changed to the playing staff, the core of the team that had played in the Second Division remained intact. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top goalscorer in each of the previous three seasons, was retained along with captain Clem Rigg, Welsh half-back Jack Newnes and goalkeeper Harry Abbott. The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively. Inside forward Dick Crawshaw, who had been the team's second-highest scorer in 1923\u201324 with five goals, moved to Stalybridge Celtic.Dykes (2009), p. 30 Scottish forward Mike McCulloch ended his two-year association with the club by joining Chesterfield on a free transfer, while half-back Leigh Collins signed for New Brighton. Other players, including William Lammus and Ernest Gillibrand, left Nelson having failed to establish themselves in the first-team during their time with the club.Dykes (2009), p. 37 Manager Wilson spent a total of \u00a3750 (\u00a3 as of 2011) on new players in the summer of 1924. Billy Bottrill and Bill Ellerington arrived from Middlesbrough, while Barrow full-back James Phizacklea was signed to bolster the defensive line.Dykes (2009), p. 58 Several young players were acquired from local non-League football during the close season, including Ambrose Harris from Briercliffe and Billy Harper, formerly of Feniscowles. The Nelson squad was considered by the local newspaper to be stronger than the one which had won the Third Division North two seasons earlier.", "| Leigh Collins"]}]}}
