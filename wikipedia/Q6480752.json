Of the 300 in the party, only 13 arrived successfully in India. The harrowing journey was forced into a major detour, due to the widespread presence of Chinese soldiers, who were trying to prevent the escape of refugees. The journey took so long that they ran out of food whilst still far from their destination. Starving and having unanimously decided not to kill animals to support themselves, they eventually had to boil leather shoes and bags to make soup to survive.Yeshe Losal, Lama Rinpoche.

This was developed in consultation with the Scottish Forestry Commission, the Scottish Office, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group, and other environmental experts, and has helped to recreate a woodland habitat to support biodiversity. A designated nature reserve for native animals, birds, and sea-life has been created on the east side of the island, and at the north end of the island, there is the Centre of World Peace and Health, whose design and construction is based upon environmental sustainability, sensitive to the ecology of its unique environment. In creating a place where humans and animals can live in peace and harmony, Holy Isle has become a model of environmentally friendly living.\"Holy Island is one monk's dream\" https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/dec/23/stephenkhan.theobserver"]}]}}
