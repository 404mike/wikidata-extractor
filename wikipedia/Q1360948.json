Having spent several years as back line roadie and tour manager for several other bands, including Hawkwind, he brought professional experience to the band's touring life and was responsible for their hiring of their long-term tour manager 'Tommy T' Walker, a fellow member of the Bradford St George's and Bradford Univ TSA stage crew. Together with frontman Justin Sullivan, Heaton was the core of the Bradford-based band, originally alongside Stuart Morrow on bass and then later with Jason 'Moose' Harris. Heaton's wide-ranging musical interests are manifested in the music for the anthemic \"Green and Grey\" as well as co-writing with Sullivan and others the New Model Army singles; \"\"Brave New World\" (Sullivan, Heaton, Harris, Denby), \"51st State\" (Sullivan, Heaton, Harris, Cartwright), \"Poison Street\" (Sullivan, Heaton), \"White Coats\"(Sullivan, Heaton, Harris), \"Space\" (Sullivan, Heaton, Nelson) and \"Here Comes the War\" (Sullivan, Heaton, Nelson). He was responsible for many of New Model Army's best-known compositions, which are still played nowadays at their gigs. He left New Model Army in 1998 due to health reasons - he had long suffered from sarcoidosis, undergoing repeated surgery, and was then diagnosed with a brain tumour - and was replaced on drums by his roadie Michael Dean. Though the surgery on his brain tumour was successful, he was advised by his surgeons that he would be unlikely to play musical instruments professionally for several years, which ultimately resulted in the end of his career with New Model Army."]}, {"page": "Glastonbury Festival line-ups", "response": ["* Justin Sullivan and Dean White"]}, {"page": "O'Sullivan", "response": ["*Justin Sullivan, frontman and lyricist of the British rock band New Model Army"]}, {"page": "Vengeance (New Model Army album)", "response": ["#\"Christian Militia\" (Justin Sullivan, Stuart Morrow) \u2013 3:25"]}, {"page": "No Rest for the Wicked (New Model Army album)", "response": ["#\"Frightened\" (Justin Sullivan, Stuart Morrow) \u2013 3:41", "*Justin Sullivan \u2013 vocals, guitar"]}, {"page": "The Ghost of Cain", "response": ["#\"The Hunt\" (Justin Sullivan, Robert Heaton) \u2013 4:11", "*Justin Sullivan \u2013 vocals, guitar"]}, {"page": "Thunder and Consolation", "response": ["#\"I Love the World\" (Justin Sullivan, Robert Heaton) \u2013 5:08", "*Justin Sullivan \u2013 mixed by (\"225\")", "*Justin Sullivan \u2013 vocals, guitar, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Impurity (New Model Army album)", "response": ["*All tracks written by Justin Sullivan and Robert Heaton except where otherwise noted", "*Justin Sullivan \u2013 vocals, guitar, keyboards"]}, {"page": "The Love of Hopeless Causes", "response": ["#\"Here Comes the War\" (Justin Sullivan, Robert Heaton, Nelson) \u2013 4:29", "*Justin Sullivan \u2013 vocals, guitars, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Beautiful Days (festival)", "response": ["| Senser, Justin Sullivan"]}, {"page": "Stepan Pasicznyk", "response": ["Session musician work includes Rev Hammer's \"Bishop of Buffalo\", produced by Justin Sullivan of New Model Army, Cage by the Bridewells produced by Phil Manzanera, guitarist of Roxy Music, and \"Swill\" Odgers of The Men They Couldn't Hang's release \"Elvis Lives Here\" with his \"Swagger Band\".
