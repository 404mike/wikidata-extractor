Sloane's career trajectory was unusual in that for most of her professional life she was essentially an anonymous bit part actress, and her best, most substantial roles did not come until relatively late in her career when she was in her 50s. Her most famous film appearance is the 1950 production Seven Days to Noon.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sing As We Go", "response": ["* Olive Sloane as Violet - The Song-Plugger's Girlfriend "]}, {"page": "Under Capricorn", "response": ["* Olive Sloane as Sal"]}, {"page": "Heavens Above!", "response": ["* Olive Sloane as Housewife"]}, {"page": "The Guinea Pig (film)", "response": ["*Olive Sloane as Aunt Mabel"]}, {"page": "A Prize of Gold", "response": ["* Olive Sloane as Mavis"]}, {"page": "Seven Days to Noon", "response": ["That evening Willingdon bumps into 'Mrs' \"Goldie\" Phillips (Olive Sloane); she invites him to buy her a drink, the two of them having met, by chance, earlier at a pawnbroker's.
