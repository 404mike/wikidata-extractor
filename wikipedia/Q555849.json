One current project is the application of SQUIDs configured as quantum-noise limited amplifiers to search for the axion, a possible component of dark matter. Clarke was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1986.  He was awarded the Comstock Prize in Physics in 1999 and the Hughes Medal in 2004. He was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in May 2012. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2017", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darwin College, Cambridge", "response": ["|John Clarke"]}, {"page": "John Clarke", "response": ["John Clarke may refer to:", "*John Clarke Whitfield (1770\u20131836), English organist and composer", "*John Clarke (socialist politician) (1885\u20131959), British lion tamer, politician, poet, newspaper editor and art expert", "*John Clarke (actor) (1931\u20132019), American soap opera actor from Days of Our Lives", "*John Clarke (poet) (1933\u20131992), American poet", "*John Clarke (satirist) (1948\u20132017), New Zealand/Australian satirist and actor", "*John Clarke (museum curator) (1954-2020), British museum curator, expert in Ladakhi and Tibetan metalwork", "*John Clarke, whaler and one of the discoverers of Jan Mayen", "*John Clarke (businessman) (1773\u20131846), American businessman from Saratoga Springs, New York", "*John Clarke (fur trader) (1781\u20131852), Hudson's Bay Company fur trader", "*John Clarke (Upper Canada) (born 1780s- died 1862), merchant and politician in Upper Canada", "*John Clarke (activist), Canadian political activist and founder of the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty", "*John Clarke (public servant), New Zealand public servant", "*John Clarke (fl. 1601), MP for Haslemere", "*John Clarke (died 1675), English landowner and politician", "*Richard Cromwell or John Clarke (1626\u20131712), second Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland", "*John Clarke (Roundhead) (fl. 1648\u20131681), English politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1653 and 1660, and fought for Parliament in the English Civil War and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland", "*John Clarke (Michigan politician) (1797\u20131876), American businessman, farmer, and politician", "*Sir John Clarke (British army officer) (1787\u20131854), officer in the British and Spanish armies", "*John Clarke (general), American general in the Creek War from Georgia ", "*John Clarke (Baptist minister) (1609\u20131676), co-founder of Rhode Island", "*John Clarke (Dean of Salisbury) (1682\u20131757), dean of Salisbury Cathedral, mathematician and natural philosopher", "*John Clarke (Congregationalist minister) (1755\u20131798), minister, First Church, Boston, Massachusetts", "*John Clarke (Baptist missionary) (1802\u20131879), author of Specimens of Dialects ", "*John Clarke (bishop) (born 1938), retired bishop of the Anglican Church of Canada", "*John Clarke (dean of Wells) (born 1952), current Dean of Wells since 2004", "*John Clarke (Oriel) (died 1781), Provost of Oriel College, Oxford", "*John Clarke (physicist) (born 1942), English physicist at University of California at Berkeley", "*John Clarke (mountaineer) (1945\u20132003), Canadian mountaineer, explorer and wilderness educator", "*John Clarke (Australian cricketer) (1829\u20131872)", "*John Clarke (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1890s), footballer who played for Bury, Blackpool and Luton Town", "*John Clarke (English footballer) (fl. 1910s\u20131920s), English football forward", "*John Clarke (rugby league) (fl. 1930s\u20131940s), Australian rugby league player", "*John Clarke (cricketer, born 1948), English cricketer", "*John Clarke (rugby union) (born 1975), New Zealand-born Samoan rugby union player", "*John Clarke (Gaelic footballer) (fl. 2000s), Gaelic footballer for Down", "*John Clarke (sailor) (born 1934), Canadian Olympic sailor", "*John Clarke (bushranger) (c. 1846\u20131867), Australian bushranger"]}, {"page": "List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1977", "response": ["| John Clarke||||Physics"]}, {"page": "LaRouche movement", "response": ["*Fusion Energy Foundation.
