At (5:14), the guitars suddenly turn distorted, repeating the chord structure until (5:43), where one of the guitars plays a solo.

The drums cease playing at (7:10), leaving the guitars playing their melodies, and gradually slowing down in a  diminuendo with the violin solo playing faintly in the background, until (10:28), when the guitars cease playing, ending on a C\u266f, which fades out.", "* Luke Sutherland \u2013 violin"]}]}}
