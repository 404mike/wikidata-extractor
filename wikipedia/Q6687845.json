Although the code for three-dimensional problems was incorporated from its inception, early versions of the software only solved for time-dependent convection problems within two-dimensional Cartesian domains. Moresi's original code turned out to be incredibly modular and easily extensible. Consequently, the fundamental finite element infrastructure which Louis wrote is still in place and forms the basis for much of the code contained in the present release."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (L)", "response": ["*Louis Moresi"]}, {"page": "Moresi", "response": ["*Louis Moresi (born 1965), British geophysicist"]}]}}
