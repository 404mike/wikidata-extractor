He has written extensively on post-war British politics. With David Butler, he wrote the series of books on British general elections, such as The British General Election of 2010, and most recently, The British General Election of 2015.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Major", "response": ["In academic circles Major's legacy has generally been better received. Mark Stuart, writing in 2017, stated that Major is \"the best ex-Prime Minister we have ever had\", praising him for initiating the Northern Ireland peace process, peacefully handing Hong Kong back to China, creating the National Lottery and leaving a sound economy to Labour in 1997. Dennis Kavanagh likewise states that Major did relatively well considering the unbridgeable divides that existed in the Conservative Party in the 1990s, chiefly over Europe, whilst also delivering economic growth, a more user-focused public sector and the basis of peace settlement in Northern Ireland. He also notes that Major's unexpected 1992 election victory effectively sealed in the Thatcher-era reforms and forced the Labour Party to ditch most of its more socialist-tinged policies, thereby permanently shifting the British political landscape to the centre ground. Anthony Seldon largely agrees with this assessment, adding that Major's deep dislike of discrimination contributed to the continuing decline in racism and homophobia in British society, and that his proactive foreign policy stance maintained Britain's influence in the world at a time of profound global change. He also notes that Major faced a deeply unfavourable set of circumstances: most of the obvious and pressing Conservative reforms (e.g. reining in the power of trade unions and privatising failing industries) had already being completed under Thatcher, the swift nature of his rise to power left him little time to formulate policy positions and upon becoming PM he was immediately thrust into having to deal with the Gulf War and a major recession. Furthermore, the narrow majority achieved after the 1992 election left him exposed to internal Conservative rebellions, which only worsened as time went by, abetted by a hostile press, as it became clear the Conservatives would lose the next election. Seldon concludes that \"Major was neither non-entity nor failure. His will be judged an important if unruly premiership at the end of the Conservative century, completing some parts of an earlier agenda while in some key respects helping to define a Conservatism for the 21st century.\" Seldon reiterated these views in his contribution to the 2017 volume John Major: An Unsuccessful Prime Minister? Political historian Robert Taylor, in his 2006 biography of Major, concurs with many of these points, summing up that \"In the perspective provided by the years of New Labour government since May 1997, John Major's record as Prime Minister looked much better than his many critics liked to suggest... Britain's most extraordinary Conservative Prime Minister bequeathed an important legacy to this party and his country to build on. One day both yet may come to recognise and appreciate it.\" Noted political historian Dick Leonard however, writing in 2004, was more harsh in his assessment, concluding that Major was \"A man of evident decent instincts, but limited abilities: as Prime Minister he pushed these abilities to the limit. It was not enough.\""]}, {"page": "Roy Jenkins", "response": ["After Dick Taverne's victory in the 1973 Lincoln by-election, where he stood as \"Democratic Labour\" in opposition to the official Labour candidate, Jenkins gave a speech to the Oxford University Labour Club denouncing the idea of a new centre party.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 401.'Mr Jenkins and Mr Taverne reject centre party proposal', The Times (10 March 1973), p. 1.

Calls for modernisation became prominent following Labour's heavy defeat in the 1983 general election, with the new Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, who came from the party's soft left Tribune Group of Labour MPs, calling for a review of policies that led to the party's defeat, and for improvements to the party's public image to be made by Peter Mandelson, a former television producer. This was complemented by MPs such as Giles Radice calling for the systematic modernisation of the party, coupled with calls for the party to become more moderate in order to increase electability. Modernisation intensified following Labour's narrow defeat in the 1992 general election, which Dennis Kavanagh and David Butler argued was caused by the party still being viewed as traditional Labour, and they stated that a 'new' party was created to rectify this and Labour's \"return to electability within months of the 1992 election defeat [was] remarkable\". Following the leadership of Neil Kinnock and John Smith, the party under the New Labour brand attempted to widen its electoral appeal and by the 1997 general election it had made significant gains in the middle class, effectively giving the party a landslide victory. Labour maintained this wider support at the 2001 general election and won a third consecutive victory in the 2005 general election for the first time ever in the history of the Labour Party."]}, {"page": "Referendum Party", "response": ["The referendum question which the party proposed was announced on 28 November 1996: \"Do you want the United Kingdom to be part of a federal Europe or do you want the United Kingdom to return to an association of sovereign nations that are part of a common trading market?\"Andrew Pierce, \"Goldsmith chooses his words for big question on Europe\", The Times, London, 28 November 1996, p. 11. The political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh noted that this question was often mocked for its \"unrealistic ambiguity\", and some journalists referred to Goldsmith's venture as the \"Referendum Only Party\". Goldsmith did not position the party as explicitly opposed to the EU, instead stating that it was \"wholly agnostic\" about EU membership and just wanted to secure a referendum on the issue.

The policies were instituted by all governments (both Labour and Conservative) in the post-war period. The consensus has been held to characterise British politics until the economic crises of the 1970s (see Secondary banking crisis of 1973\u20131975) which led to the end of the post-war economic boom and the rise of monetarist economics. The roots of his economics, however, stem from critique of the economics of the interwar period depression. Keynes' style of economics encouraged a more active role of the government in order to \"manage overall demand so that there was a balance between demand and output\".Kavanagh, Dennis, Peter Morris, and Dennis Kavanagh.

The Conservative Party accepted many of these changes, and promised not to reverse them in its 1947 Industrial Charter. Attlee, using the Beveridge Report and Keynes economics, laid out his plans for what became known as \"The Attlee Settlement\".Kavanagh, Dennis, Peter Morris, and Dennis Kavanagh.
