He was educated at Clifton College. He was a member of the board for the Imperial Tobacco Company.\nHis name is particularly associated with Bristol University. He was responsible for meeting the funding needed to build Wills Hall, a hall of residence for Bristol University students. He also funded the building of the H. H.

The Grotto in the grounds is a Grade I listed building. Clifton Hill House is another Grade I listed building now used as student accommodation in Clifton. The original building was constructed between 1745 and 1750 by Isaac Ware, and has been used by the university since its earliest days in 1909. Manor Hall comprises five separate buildings, the principal of which was erected from 1927 to 1932 to the design of George Oatley following a donation from Henry Herbert Wills.
