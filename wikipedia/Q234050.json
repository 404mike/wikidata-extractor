The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's \"transmutation\" theory of 1809, which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level, these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents. (The latter process was later called Lamarckism.) These ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support. In particular, Georges Cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs.

In 1767 he started as a consultant at Stafford Royal Infirmary. He married Helena Cookes (an amateur botanical illustrator, and a former patient of his) in 1772; they had three children (the first, Helena was born in 1775 but died a few days later, William was born in 1776, and Charlotte in 1778).  In 1775 he was appointed physician to Birmingham General Hospital (at the suggestion of Erasmus Darwin, a physician and founder member of the Lunar Society), but in 1783 he diagnosed himself as having pulmonary tuberculosis and went twice to Portugal hoping the better winter climate would improve his health;  it did not.  On the way home from his second trip there, the ship he was in was chased by pirates.  In 1785 he was elected a Fellow of the prestigious Royal Society and also published his Account of the Foxglove (see below).   The following year he leased Edgbaston Hall, in Birmingham.  He was one of the members of the Lunar Society.\"William Withering (1741-1799): A Birmingham Lunatic\" Proc R Coll Physicians Edinb 2001; 31:77-83.

In 1799 he decided that he could not tolerate another winter in the cold and draughty Hall, so he bought \"The Larches\" in the nearby Sparkbrook area; his wife did not feel up to the move and remained at Edgbaston Hall.  After moving to The Larches on 28 September, he died on 6 October 1799.", "Allegedly, Withering first learned of the use of digitalis in treating \"dropsy\" (\u0153dema) from \"Mother Hutton\", an old woman who practised as a folk herbalist in Shropshire, who used the plant as part of a polyherbal formulation containing over 20 different ingredients to successfully treat this condition.  Withering deduced that digitalis was the active ingredient in the formulation, and  over the ensuing nine years he carefully tried out different preparations of various parts of the plant (collected in different seasons) documenting 156 cases where he had employed digitalis, and describing the effects and the best - and safest - way of using it.  At least one of these cases was a patient for whom Erasmus Darwin had asked Withering for his second opinion.  In January 1785 Darwin submitted a paper entitled \"An Account of the Successful Use of Foxglove in Some Dropsies and in Pulmonary Consumption\" to the College of Physicians in London;Medical Transactions, Volume 3, 1785, published by the College of Physicians, London. Transaction XVI, pp 255-286  it was presented by Darwin in March of that year.  A postscriptMedical Transactions, Volume 3, 1785, published by the College of Physicians, London. Transaction XXVIII, p 448 at the end of the published volume of transactions containing Darwin's paper states that \"Whilst the last pages of this volume were in the press, Dr Withering of Birmingham... published a numerous collection of cases in which foxglove has been given, and frequently with good success\".  After this, Darwin and Withering became increasingly estranged, and eventually a argument broke out apparently resulting from Robert Darwin having accused Withering of unprofessional behaviour by effectively poaching patients. This is a very early example of medical academic plagiarism. This was in reality orchestrated by Erasmus Darwin, a man whose anger and sarcasm when he felt slighted had in all likelihood contributed to the suicide of his own son and later to the estrangement of his son Robert.", "In reality \"Mother Hutton\" was created in 1928 in an illustration by William Meade Prince as part of an advertising campaign by Parke-Davis who marketed digitalis preparations. There is no mention of a Mother Hutton in Withering's works or anyone else's and no mention of him meeting any old woman directly. In his account he states that he is merely asked to comment on a family recipe that was originally an old woman's receipt or recipe (that she had long kept secret) by a colleague. Since 1928, Mother Hutton's status has grown from being an image in an advertising poster to an acclaimed wise woman, herbalist, pharmacist and medical practitioner in Shropshire who was cheated out of her true recognition by Dr. Withering's unscrupulous methods. The story often written around this is also totally apocryphal.  Withering was in fact informed of the Brasenose College, Oxford case by one of his medical colleagues Dr. Ash at Birmingham Hospital and the Dean was treated with digitalis root not leaves. The myth of Mother Hutton and how Withering chased her around Shropshire has been created by authors not going back to primary sources but instead copying and then embellishing the unreferenced work of others. See \"Withering and The Foxglove; the making of a myth\" by D.M. Krikler British Heart Journal 1985 54: 256-257. In Withering's Account of the Foxglove printed in 1785 Withering mentions seven different occasions when foxglove was brought to his attention. Recognising that foxglove was the active ingredient in a family recipe (that was long kept secret by an old woman in Shropshire) would not have been difficult with his expert botanical knowledge. Withering had first published his Botanical Arrangement in 1776 and in it suggested foxglove deserved looking at in more detail. Erasmus Darwin tried to take the credit for foxglove and failed. Erasmus Darwin then attempted to try and discredit Withering behind the scenes with the unwitting help of his son Robert having earlier used the thesis of his dead son Charles to try and establish priority. Charles Darwin in fact had been friendly with Withering (as had Robert) and had talked in Edinburgh University about Withering's experiments with foxglove. Erasmus Darwin was probably jealous that Withering had become the most famous and sought after doctor outside London and that Withering's English Botanical Arrangement became the standard reference source and far exceeded the botanical publications of Erasmus (all published semi-anonymously) in popularity. Withering's Botanical Arrangement, although now almost forgotten, became the standard reference for English Botany for almost the next 100 years."]}, {"page": "William Herschel", "response": ["Most of Herschel's observations were done with a smaller ,  reflector.

It also became a centre of great intellectual activity, being the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson, David Garrick, Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward; this prompted Johnson's remark that Lichfield was \"a city of philosophers\". In the 1720s Daniel Defoe described Lichfield as 'a fine, neat, well-built, and indifferent large city', the principal town in the region after Chester.From: 'Lichfield: From the Reformation to c.1800', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 14-24.

During the late 18th and early 19th century much of the medieval city was rebuilt with the red-brick Georgian style buildings still to be seen today. Also during this time, the city's infrastructure underwent great improvements, with underground sewerage systems, paved streets and gas-powered street lighting. An infantry regiment of the British Army was formed at Lichfield in 1705 by Col. Luke Lillingstone in the King's Head tavern in Bird Street. In 1751 it became the 38th Regiment of Foot, and in 1783 the 1st Staffordshire Regiment; after reorganisation in 1881 it became the 1st battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment.", "*Erasmus Darwin House - Home to Erasmus Darwin, the house was restored to create a museum which opened to the public in 1999.", "thumb|160px|Erasmus Darwin, 1792", "* Erasmus Darwin (1731\u20131802), scientist, inventor and grandfather of Charles Darwin"]}, {"page": "Karl Pearson", "response": ["After Galton's death in 1911, Pearson embarked on producing his definitive biography \u2014 a three-volume tome of narrative, letters, genealogies, commentaries, and photographs \u2014 published in 1914, 1924, and 1930, with much of Pearson's own money paying for their print runs. The biography, done \"to satisfy myself and without regard to traditional standards, to the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public\", triumphed Galton's life, work and personal heredity.

Zirkle recorded that Pliny the Elder thought much the same. Zirkle also pointed out that stories involving the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics appear numerous times in ancient mythology and the Bible, and persisted through to Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories.

In his 1800 book, Phytologia: or, The philosophy of agriculture and gardening, Erasmus Darwin wrote that plant growth resembled swarms observed elsewhere in nature.
