His awkward attempts to strike up friendships with his colleagues (asking his Cabinet colleagues to call him \"Jack\": only J. H. Thomas did so, and Neville Chamberlain settled on \"John\") often fell flat.Jenkins, Roy The Chancellors (London: Macmillan, 1998), p. 366. Jenkins likens him to the nursery rhyme character Dr Fell.Jenkins 1999, p. 369: \"I do not like thee Dr Fell, the reason why I cannot tell, but this I know and know full well, I do not like thee Dr Fell\". In the 1930s, his reputation sank particularly low. Although Simon's athletic build and good looks were remarked on even into his old age, the cartoonist David Low portrayed him with, in Low's own words, a \"sinuous writhing body\" to reflect his \"disposition to subtle compromise\". Harold Nicolson, after Simon had grabbed his arm from behind to talk to him (19 October 1944), wrote pithily \"God what a toad and a worm Simon is!\" Another anecdote, from the late 1940s, tells how the socialist intellectual G. D. H. Cole got into a third-class compartment on the train back from Oxford to London to break off conversation with Simon; to his dismay, Simon followed suit, only for both men to produce first-class tickets when the inspector did his rounds."]}, {"page": "Margaret Bondfield", "response": ["Although not a candidate herself, Bondfield campaigned for Labour in the general election of July 1945\u2014a reporter found her instructing a meeting in Bury St Edmunds on the benefits of nationalisation.  She was active in her local Labour Party, and continued to chair the Women's Group of Public Welfare until 1948. Her main task in these years was her autobiography, published in 1948 under the title A Life's Work. The purpose of the book, she wrote, was not to celebrate her own achievements, instead she hoped that her experiences \"may be of some service to the younger generation\".Bondfield, p. 10 The book had an indifferent reception; in The Observer, Harold Nicolson described it as \"ill composed and badly proportioned\", with too much space devoted to inconsequential meetings while truly important events were hurried over. Nevertheless, he thought the book provided \"a fine example of resolute and in the end triumphant energy\".  The Manchester Guardians reviewer also criticised the work's confused structure and unselective detail, but found it \"a useful, direct and honest\" account of Labour's early years.

Although Australia and the other Dominions signed the Treaty of Versailles separately and became individual members of the League of Nations, for the preceding negotiations their representatives (and those of the United Kingdom) were considered to form one single British Empire delegation. Cook was chosen as the lead British delegate on the Commission on Czechoslovak Affairs, which was tasked with determining the final borders of Czechoslovakia. He was hampered by his lack of knowledge of European geography and inability to speak French, the contemporary language of diplomacy. According to Charles Seymour, one of the American delegates, he was \"blissfully ignorant of everything European and practically every word of our discussion was Greek to him\". Harold Nicolson, the other British delegate, said that he assumed an attitude of \"benevolent boredom\" during meetings. Cook was generally in favour of an enlarged Czechoslovakia, believing that the lands of the Sudeten Germans had to be included in Czechoslovakia for security reasons. He and Nicolson had a difference of opinion over Great Sch\u00fctt, but French delegation was in agreement with Cook and the island was awarded to Czechoslovakia."]}, {"page": "Reginald Maudling", "response": ["Shortly after graduating, Maudling set up a meeting with Harold Nicolson to discuss whether it would be better, as a moderate conservative, to join the Conservative Party or National Labour; Nicolson advised him to wait. Maudling was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1940. However, he did not practise as a barrister, having volunteered for service in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Old Men Forget", "response": ["Old Men Forget was well received by reviewers. The Times said, \"at times he can stir the reader deeply with his account of human sorrow or success. With all this he succeeds, not indeed in writing one of the greatest autobiographies, but at least in writing one where the many good things are a delight and which is always full of interest.\" In The Manchester Guardian, Roger Fulford wrote, \"The gifts of understanding and of style, which distinguish this book, lift it above the serried ranks of recollections and memoirs into the realm of literature.Fulford, Roger. \"The Moods of Munich: Lord Norwich's Memoirs\", The Manchester Guardian, 3 November 1953, p. 6 Harold Nicolson in The Observer called the book \"an autobiography which, in its perfect balance between the objective and the subjective \u2026 furnishes an example of the way in which this sort of thing should be done.\"Nicolson, Harold. \"Good Living\", The Observer, 8 November 1953, p. 9"]}, {"page": "Gladwyn Jebb", "response": ["Jebb entered the British Diplomatic Service in 1924 and served in Tehran, where he became known to Harold Nicolson and to Vita Sackville-West.

Arriving in London, she was promptly taken under the wing of socialite Sibyl Colefax, whose drawing room had become filled with \"the bright young things\" of the day such as John Gielgud, Harold Nicolson, No\u00ebl Coward and notables such as Arnold Bennett, Max Beerbohm and Bernard Shaw. Photos of Loos on the London social scene appeared in the New York papers, and the unwell Emerson subsequently joined Loos. To keep his spirits up she took him to the theater every night. It worked; at times he spoke in normal tones. The couple traveled on to Paris as Emerson's recovery continued. In September, their vacation was cut short; Loos was needed back in New York to do revisions on Blondes for its Broadway debut. Despite them, Blondes closed in April 1927."]}, {"page": "Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso", "response": ["In July 1931, a meeting took place at Sinclair's house, where Oswald Mosley and Harold Nicolson met Churchill, Lloyd George and Brendan Bracken, to discuss a political alliance. About a month later, the Liberal Party joined the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald, with Sinclair appointed Secretary of State for Scotland. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. In 1932, he, together with other Liberal ministers led by Herbert Samuel, resigned from the government in protest at the Ottawa Conference introducing Imperial Preference.", "At the time of the Munich Crisis in September 1938, Sinclair was one of the anti-appeasement group who gathered around Churchill, with Leo Amery, Robert Boothby, Robert Cecil, Harold Macmillan and Harold Nicolson. On a personal level, Violet Bonham Carter was a frequent guest of the Sinclairs at Dalnawillan Lodge in the Flow Country, as were Harcourt Johnstone and Lady Gwendoline Churchill, wife of Jack Churchill and Winston's sister-in-law. Bonham Carter was a Liberal activist, close follower of Churchill, anti-appeaser and League of Nations Union member."]}]}}
