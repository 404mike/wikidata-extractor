He played as a left half.\nLayton was born in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, and played local football before joining Small Heath in September 1898. He made his debut in the Second Division on 18 February 1899, deputising for William Robertson in a home game against New Brighton Tower which resulted in a 3\u20132 win. Layton, an attacking half-back, featured regularly in the second half of the 1899\u20131900 season, but the arrival of Walter Wigmore as first-choice centre-half meant Alec Leake moved to the left side and Layton lost his place. He then returned to non-league football.", "link_mentions": {}}}
