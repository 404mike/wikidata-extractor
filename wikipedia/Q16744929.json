His notable achievements in the bomb squad were negotiating the rise of The Angry Brigade, eventually jailing several members. The other major event he negotiated as commander with the Bomb Squad was the Balcombe Street siege, in which two people were taken hostage by four Irish Republican Army members, who demanded a plane to Ireland. Bond, answering the demands, refused saying that the police \"are not going to make any deals\". The gunmen surrendered, the event a success for police with no casualties on either side.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest", "response": ["*Ernest Radcliffe Bond (1919\u20132003), British police officer and soldier"]}, {"page": "2003 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Ernest Radcliffe Bond, soldier and Metropolitan Police commissioner (born 1919)"]}, {"page": "March 1919", "response": ["* Born: Reg Sprigg, Australian geologist, known for his research in the Precambrian period, in Yorketown, South Australia, Australia (d. 1994); Ernest Radcliffe Bond, British law enforcer, commander of the Bomb Squad with the Metropolitan Police Service in London, in Barrow-in-Furness, England (d. 2003); Alberto A.
