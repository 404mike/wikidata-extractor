Although Cowley's plays and poetry did not enjoy wide popularity after the 19th century, critic Melinda Finberg rates her as \"one of the foremost playwrights of the late eighteenth century\" whose \"skill in writing fluid, sparkling dialogue and creating sprightly, memorable comic characters compares favourably with her better-known contemporaries, Goldsmith and Sheridan.\" Cowley's plays were produced frequently in her lifetime. The major themes of her plays \u2013 including her first, The Runaway (1776), and her major success, which is being revived, The Belle's Stratagem (1780) \u2013 revolve around marriage and how women strive to overcome the injustices imposed by family life and social custom.", "link_mentions": {}}}
