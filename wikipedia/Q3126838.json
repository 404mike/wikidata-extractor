The major themes of her plays \u2013 including her first, The Runaway (1776), and her major success, which is being revived, The Belle's Stratagem (1780) \u2013 revolve around marriage and how women strive to overcome the injustices imposed by family life and social custom.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley (1743\u20131809, E)"]}, {"page": "1743", "response": ["* March 14 \u2013 Hannah Cowley, English dramatist and poet (d. 1809)"]}, {"page": "1809", "response": ["* March 11 \u2013 Hannah Cowley, English dramatist and poet (b. 1743)"]}, {"page": "1809 in literature", "response": ["*March 11 \u2013 Hannah Cowley, English dramatist and poet (born 1743)"]}, {"page": "1794 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 The Town Before You"]}, {"page": "1776 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 The Runaway"]}, {"page": "1784 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley"]}, {"page": "1743 in literature", "response": ["*March 14 \u2013 Hannah Cowley, English dramatist and poet (died 1809)"]}, {"page": "1779 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley"]}, {"page": "1780 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 The Belle's Stratagem", "*Hannah Cowley \u2013 The Maid of Aragon"]}, {"page": "1781 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 The World as it Goes"]}, {"page": "1782 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 The Belle's Stratagem"]}, {"page": "1783 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 Which is the Man?"]}, {"page": "1786 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 A School for Greybeards"]}, {"page": "1788 in literature", "response": ["*Hannah Cowley \u2013 The Fate of Sparta"]}, {"page": "Charles Kemble", "response": ["His first London appearance was on 21 April 1794, as Malcolm to his brother's Macbeth.

Her father, Phillip Parkhouse, was an educated bookseller, which helped develop Cowley\u2019s literary interest and skill. In 1772, she married Thomas Cowley, a bookseller\u2019s son. Most female playwrights of the time period were either unmarried or abandoned playwriting shortly after their marriage. However, Thomas\u2019s small earnings as a writer allowed her to try her hand at playwriting. Cowley\u2019s interest in playwriting was allegedly sparked by a \u201cdull night out at the theatre\u201d; she decided she could write a better play than the one she had just watched, so shortly after, she wrote The Runaway. Cowely\u2019s first play The Runaway debuted in February 1776. With the help of David Garrick, The Runaway became a huge success and earned Cowley over 500 pounds.
