Born in Adelaide, he received a primary education before becoming a farm worker and apprentice printer, running his own printing business by 1871. He sat on Hindmarsh, Unley, and Adelaide City councils, and was President of the South Australian Liberal Union. He was elected to the Australian Senate as an Anti-Socialist Senator for South Australia in the 1906 Election, but his election was declared void on 31 May 1907. The South Australian Labor Government attempted to install James O'Loghlin in the vacancy. Vardon's initial attempts to obtain a fresh election were unsuccessful. Vardon subsequently succeeded with the High Court declaring O'Loghlin's appointment was void and ordering a supplementary election. Vardon and O'Loghlin both contested the election, with Vardon winning comfortably with 54% of the vote. He was defeated in the 1913 Election, by now a member of the Commonwealth Liberal Party.His son, Edward Vardon, was an MP for Sturt 1918\u20131921, 1924\u20131930 and South Australian Nationalist Senator 1921\u20131923.His daughter, Hilda Marian Vardon (1886\u20131959) married Horace Abercrombie Fairweather (1881\u20131969), brother of Andrew Fairweather, on 12 April 1911.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edmund Barton", "response": ["Sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, Barton was the sole judge in Blundell v Vardon (1907), where he ruled that Joseph Vardon's election to the Senate was void due to electoral irregularities. He joined with Griffith and O'Connor in the majority opinion in R v Barger (1908), \"the High Court's most decisive intervention to date in thwarting social reforms passed by the Commonwealth parliament\". In a series of cases around the same time, the trio also restricted the powers of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Barton and Griffith split notably in New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915), with the court voting 4\u20132 to strip the Inter-State Commission of any judicial power, much to Barton's dismay. Only Gavan Duffy sided with his argument that parliament should determine the commission's powers rather than the court. The decision was \"a rebuff to Barton's authority as an interpreter of the Constitution and his special authority as one of its draftsman\"."]}, {"page": "Commonwealth Liberal Party", "response": ["A second interstate conference was held in Melbourne in May 1912, with Senator Joseph Vardon presiding. A constitution for the Australian Liberal Union was adopted, where it was agreed that the organisation would be governed by an annual conference. The constitution provided that the union would regularly confer with the federal parliamentary party, and that its work would be confined to federal politics. The state organisations would remain in charge of state politics, but would select federal candidates. The conference also debated a fighting platform for the next federal election, which was not issued until 13 June.
