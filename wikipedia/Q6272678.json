In 2001 he presented Weak Dance Strong Questions (2001), a collaboration with the Dutch theatre director Jan Ritsema. This was followed with the trilogy, Both Sitting Duet (2002), The Quiet Dance (2005) and Speaking Dance (2006) with the Italian composer and long-time collaborator Matteo Fargion.\nOther high-profile collaborators include Sylvie Guillem's performance of his choreography in Adam Robert's film Blue Yellow in 1996, and his invitation in 1997 to choreograph for William Forsythe's Ballet Frankfurt.\nIn 2003 Burrows and Matteo Fargion received the 2003\u20132004 New York Dance and Performance Bessie Awards for Both Sitting Duet. Burrows received a 2002 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.Burrows has commented that it is sometimes difficult making dance in his home country of Britain,  and that in Europe he finds a much more appreciative and open-minded dance and theatre industry.Burrows has devoted fan-base among the (mostly young) dance in-crowd.He currently lives in London and Brussels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kevin Volans", "response": ["Despite the success of the African series, Volans began to find himself increasingly categorized as an \"African\" composer\u2014a label which he found creatively restricting. In the late 1980s he began to pursue a new direction, developing a style characterized by an overall tendency towards increasing abstraction occasionally punctuated by works where literal African elements once again re-emerge. This is clearly seen in works such as Chevron (1990) and One Hundred Frames (1991), as well as his opera The Man with Footsoles of Wind (1993) based on the last year of the life of the 19th-century poet Arthur Rimbaud. A parallel development to this was his increasing interest in writing for dance, an art-form particularly suited to Volans's open conception of formal structure and he has collaborated with the choreographers Jonathan Burrows, Siobhan Davies and Shobana Jeyasingh.", "* Dance Films by Adam Roberts (Duke Quartet, Kevin Volans, DVD, The Jonathan Burrows Group, 1995)"]}, {"page": "Kenneth MacMillan", "response": ["| Wayne Eagling, Alessandra Ferri, Stephen Jefferies, Guy Niblett, David Drew, Jonathan Burrows, Jonathan Cope, Antony Dowson, Ross MacGibbon, Bruce Sansom, Stephen Sheriff"]}, {"page": "Burrows (surname)", "response": ["* Jonathan Burrows, English choreographer"]}, {"page": "The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other", "response": ["It was produced with a new translation by Meredith Oakes at the Lyttelton Theatre, National Theatre, London, opening on 13 February 2008.
