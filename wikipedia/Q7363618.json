They enjoy rivalries with both Millwall and former tenants Charlton Athletic.

The tie went to two replays, but the second replay ended in controversy after referee Ron Challis ordered a successful Brighton penalty to be retaken because of Palace player encroachment.

Palace took the lead after 18 minutes through Phil Holder. Brighton dominated much of the game's remainder, with striker Peter Ward having a goal disallowed shortly after as he was adjudged to have handled the ball, although Palace's Jim Cannon later said that this only occurred due to him shoving the Brighton striker.  In the 78th minute, Brighton were awarded a penalty which was converted by Brian Horton only to be disallowed as referee Ron Challis adjudged that players had encroached upon the penalty area. Horton retook the penalty and this time it was saved by the Palace keeper, Paul Hammond.

As a result of this, to avoid crowd congestion, the kick-off was put back by five minutes. This was to prove very significant as the evening progressed, although club historians are not certain whether it was initiated by Coventry City, by the West Midlands Police or by the referee, Ron Challis. Hill later wrote in his autobiography that the decision had been made by the referee, whereas The Guardian Rob Smyth maintained in a 2012 article that it was \"generally perceived that [the delay] was the doing of Hill\"."]}]}}
