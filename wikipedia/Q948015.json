They continued their spending on the 22nd by bringing in Polish Midfielder Radoslaw Majewski on a season-long loan deal with an option to buy him included. Later that day Forest sent 2 teams out in pre-season friendly's, one to face Rotherham United, the other to face Rushden and Diamonds. The first team squad was mixed between the 2 matches as one side beat Rotherham 1\u20130 with Earnshaw's first goal of the pre-season while the other drew 1\u20131 with Diamonds thanks to a goal from Majewski on his debut scored after just 90 seconds.

However Forest were then up against high-flying Blackpool and suffered a 1\u20130 defeat before going out of the League Cup by the same scoreline to Blackburn Rovers. But a 1\u20130 win over struggling Plymouth Argyle gave Forest a new lease of life and they made it consecutive wins after a 2\u20130 win over Scunthorpe United. In October, Forest moved up to 10th place, their highest position in the Football League since the 2003/04 season, after a 2\u20131 victory over Darren Ferguson's, Peterborough United. Forest then defeated Newcastle United, who were then in second place in the table, at home to gain their fourth consecutive win and consign the Toon to only their second defeat of the season. An injury-time winner from Guy Moussi saw Forest to their fifth-consecutive win, against Barnsley at home. However, after this Moussi was sent off for a second bookable offence, for celebrating with the Forest fans in the Trent End. Forest ended the month with a 1\u20131 draw away at Crystal Palace after coming from behind. November started where October left off with two 1\u20131 draws against Cardiff City and Bristol City. Lewis McGugan rescued a point with an injury-time equaliser against Cardiff, with Wes Morgan scoring a late goal against Bristol City, who pulled level later in the game. The next match saw Forest play Middlesbrough away. An early goal from the home team saw Forest on the back foot but a free kick in second half from Robert Earnshaw saw Forest to their fourth-successive 1\u20131 draw. The week after Forest introduced a 'mixed area' of fans, where fans of both Forest and Doncaster could sit together. After selling out this allocation, they went on to record their biggest win of the season, at that stage, with a 4\u20131 victory. This also saw Nicky Shorey make his debut for the Reds. Forest kick started December with an impressive 5\u20131 victory over East Midlands neighbours Leicester City, including a Robert Earnshaw hat-trick. Forest then claimed a draw at Sheffield United before going to win at Swansea City and beat Preston at home, Billy Davies' and Paul McKenna's former club who scored the first goal. The Christmas period saw Forest get a draw away at Watford and a win at home against Coventry City. January began with a very important win over promotion rivals West Bromwich Albion. Blackstock, Majewski and Cohen all got on the scoresheet as the Reds won 3\u20131 to help them leap frog West Brom into second place. The month continued to be good as Forest beat Reading 2\u20131 and thumped QPR 5\u20130 at home to help them stay in second place.  However the month ended in disaster as Forest lost away for the first time in the season to local rivals Derby County 1\u20130. This saw their 19-game unbeaten run come to an end. This, coupled with the FA Cup exit, saw mixed emotions through the month. Forest bounced back in February with a win at home to Sheffield Wednesday, thanks to a Dexter Blackstock brace, which saw Forest's impressive home record continue. However, the defeat to Derby away had had its effects. Two away defeats on the bounce to Coventry City and Doncaster Rovers saw the Reds slip down to third, despite being unbeaten away for the earlier parts of the season. Home wins against Sheffield United and Middlesbrough saw Forest back up to 3rd but their away form took another blow as they lost to Leicester City 3\u20130 away.  March began with an injury time winner from Luke Chambers against Swansea City at home saw Forest mount a push to keep the pressure on second placed WBA but away defeats against Preston North End and Barnsley dented these hopes. A 4th consecutive 1\u20130 win at home, against Peterborough United, and a 2\u20130 win against Crystal Palace saw Forest equal Brian Clough's record of twelve consecutive home wins but it was not enough though as West Bromwich Albion got further away in the promotion push. A 7th consecutive away defeat, against table topping Newcastle United, saw most fans condemn themselves to the playoffs and West Brom pulled away even further. April saw Forest gained their first away point in three months against Bristol City thanks to a finish from outside the box from Guy Moussi to draw 1\u20131. Forest's draw at home to Cardiff 2 days later meant Newcastle were confirmed of promotion. Forest then got an impressive win against Ipswich at home which saw them qualify for the playoffs, but also meant West Brom gained the final automatic promotion place. The following week Forest played Blackpool away, the last team to beat them at home back in September. With Forest already qualified for the playoffs, the starting 11 saw many fringe players in, which saw Forest go on to lose 3\u20131 with Joe Garner getting the consolation, his first of the season.
