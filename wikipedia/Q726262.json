Important composers included William Byrd (1543\u20131623), John Dowland (1563\u20131626) Thomas Campion (1567\u20131620), and Robert Johnson (c. 1583\u2013c. 1634). The composers were commissioned by church and Court, and deployed two main styles, madrigal and ayre.Comegys Boyd (1973) Elizabethan music and musical criticism, Greenwood Press  The popular culture showed a strong interest in folk songs and ballads (folk songs that tell a story).

In 1617 Gibbons gained the position as keyboard player in an ensemble, organised by John Cooper, for the privy chamber of Prince Charles (later King Charles I). Gibbons was the only keyboardist in a group of 17 musicians which included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger, Thomas Ford, Robert Johnson and Thomas Lupo. The Prince himself was thought to have occasionally joined on either the Bass-Viol or Viol da Gamba. It is likely that Gibbons, along with Coperario, was able to write for this ensemble and had pieces premiered by it. In addition to this, Gibbons probably gained a 3rd position in September 1619, attending the royal privy chamber of James I. His next major work, Fantasies of Three Parts was published around 1620 and dedicated it to Edmund Wray. This seemingly random dedication has provoked much speculation. It may be because Wray could secure Gibbons a better post, or it may be an action of gratitude for having already secured him the post for the royal privy chamber of the King."]}, {"page": "The History of Cardenio", "response": ["Two existing plays have been put forward as being related to the lost play.

This source refers to Michael Wood's claims regarding Shakespeare's authorship of \"Woods, rocks, and mountains\".\"Woods Rocks and Mountains\" performed on Youtube", "In the late period represented by Shakespeare's known collaborations with Fletcher in Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, his style had become so involved that it is difficult for a listener or even a reader to catch the meanings of many passages on a quick hearing or a first read, so Theobald might have found it necessary to alter the text in a way that made Shakespeare's voice unrecognisable. However historian Michael Wood has found an \"idiosyncratic\" verse in the Theobald adaptation which he believes could only have been written by Shakespeare. Wood also asserts that the lyrics of at least one song by Shakespeare's regular collaborator, composer Robert Johnson, are related to Double Falsehood, indicating that Theobald had access to a genuine original text.\"1612: The Lost Play\", In Search of Shakespeare series, PBS.Wood (2003: 330) The song in question, \"Woods, Rocks and Mountains\" has survived in a manuscript in Oxford. As \"Double Falsehood\" is substantially shorter than any other play of Shakespeare's and is completely lacking in a subplot, which all other Shakespearean plays have, it is likely that one of Theobald's revisions was to remove a subplot from his manuscript version. The removed subplot likely would have included the characters of Don Quixote and Sancho, who are conspicuously absent from Double Falsehood."]}, {"page": "Robert Johnson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Johnson (1911\u20131938) was an American blues singer and guitarist.", "Robert Johnson may also refer to:", "*Robert Johnson (artist) (1770\u20131796), English artist, pupil of Thomas Bewick", "*Robert Johnson (born 1948), British comic entertainer known under the stage name Bob Carolgees", "*Robert Johnson (Scottish composer) (c. 1470\u2013after 1554), Scottish renaissance composer and priest", "*Robert Johnson (English composer) (c. 1583\u20131633), English lutenist and composer", "*Robert Leroy Johnson (1911\u20131938), US blues guitarist and primary target of Robert Johnson", "*Robert Johnson (drummer), former drummer for KC and the Sunshine Band", "*Robert Johnson (Civil War) (1834\u20131869), Civil War Brigadier General and secretary to the President of the United States", "* Robert Johnson (governor) (1682\u20131735), governor of South Carolina", "* Robert Johnson (Louisiana politician) (born 1975), Louisiana House of Representatives ", "* Robert Johnson III (born 1958), Mississippi House of Representatives ", "*Robert Johnson (English politician) (c. 1537\u20131622), English politician who sat in the House of Commons, 1597\u20131614", "*Robert Johnson (died 1730), Irish MP for Trim and Athboy", "*Robert Johnson (died 1721), Irish MP for Athboy and Harristown", "*Robert Johnson (1745\u20131833), Irish MP for Hillsborough and Philipstown", "*Robert Johnson (Australian politician) (1812\u20131866), New South Wales politician", "*Robert Johnson (martyr) (died 1582), Catholic priest", "*Robert Johnson (Archdeacon of Leicester) (1540\u20131625), Puritan rector", "*Robert Johnson (bishop) (died 1767), Anglican Bishop of Cloyne, 1759\u20131767", "*Robert Johnson (economist), American economist", "*Robert Johnson (historian), professor at the University of Toronto", "*Robert Johnson (handballer) (born 1951), Canadian handball player who competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics", "*Robert Johnson (tight end) (born 1980), American football player (NFL tight end)", "*Robert Johnson (safety) (born 1987), American football player (NFL safety for the Tennessee Titans)", "*Robert Johnson (wide receiver) (born 1982), American football player", "*Robert Johnson (runner), 1981 USA marathon champion", "*Sir Robert Johnson (civil servant) (1874\u20131938), British civil servant, Deputy Master of the Royal Mint, 1922\u20131938", "*Robert Johnson (prison officer) (born 1953), American air force veteran and former prison guard", "*\"Robert Johnson\", a song by Alexis Korner from The Party Album", "*The Robert Johnson Songbook, a 1998 album by the Peter Green Splinter Group"]}, {"page": "Fitzwilliam Virginal Book", "response": ["* Pavana (Robert Johnson set by Giles Farnaby)", "* Alman (Robert Johnson set by Giles Farnaby)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Morley", "response": ["Living in London at the same time as Shakespeare, Morley was the most famous composer of secular music in Elizabethan England.
