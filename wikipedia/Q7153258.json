In mid-August 1974, he produced a startling return of 8-13 for Worcestershire II against Lancashire II in a very low-scoring game that was over in a single day.After this performance, Roberts was immediately called up to the first team for the John Player League game against Surrey. He took 2-32 (including the wicket of Geoff Howarth) from his eight overs in a match curtailed by the weather (Worcestershire were adjudged the winners on run rate), and was picked to play against Glamorgan in the County Championship at the end of the month. He managed only a single wicket in his 21 overs, that of Arthur Francis.\nIn 1975 Roberts played only minor cricket, mostly for the Worcestershire second team but also one of the warm-up matches for the World Cup, a 55-over game in which he took the wicket of Gundappa Viswanath. This match did not have List A status, despite the strong sides fielded by both teams.\nRoberts died in the Cumberland Lake District aged only 25, at Raven Crag, Coombe Ghyl, Borrowdale.\nNote: Cricinfo lists him as \"Christopher Roberts\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cleethorpes", "response": ["*Paul Roberts, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Christopher Roberts", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Roberts (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Paul Roberts", "response": ["Paul Roberts may refer to:", "*Paul Roberts (musician) (born 1959), British musician, ex-lead singer of The Stranglers", "*Paul Roberts, British musician with rock group Sniff 'n' the Tears", "*Paul Roberts, British musician with house music group K-Klass", "*Paul Roberts (footballer, born 1962), English footballer for several teams in the Football League", "*Paul Roberts (footballer, born 1977), Welsh footballer", "*Paul Roberts (author), American journalist and author on resources such as oil and food", "*Paul Roberts (cricketer) (1951\u20131977), English cricketer", "*Paul Roberts (American footballer) (born 1963), British American football defensive back", "*Paul Roberts (rugby league) (born 1962), Australian rugby league player"]}, {"page": "Chris Roberts", "response": ["*Paul Roberts (cricketer) (Christopher Paul Roberts, 1951\u20131977), English cricketer"]}]}}
