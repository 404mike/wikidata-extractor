Misbehaviour was received positively, with Variety's Guy Lodge dubbing Knightly \"likable as ever\" but admitted she portrays \"the least intriguing figure\". Knightley was due to produce and star in The Essex Serpent, an Apple TV+ adaptation of Sarah Perry's novel, but dropped out over concerns about access to childcare during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic.
