The trial proved successful, he made his Football League debut on 6 September 1922 in a goalless draw away to Newcastle United, and, according to the Athletic News in March 1924, he \"gave such a sound and, indeed, striking display, even at left half-back, that he has been considered a regular member of the side ever since.\" He kept his place for two more matches before the England international Percy Barton returned from injury. A few weeks later, after more injuries left a vacancy at right half, Dale \"demonstrated his versatility by at once falling into the position\", and held it until mid-March 1923 when Jimmy Daws came back into the team. He made 34 League appearances in the 1923\u201324 season, mainly at right half but also covering at centre half."]}, {"page": "James Daws", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Daws"]}]}}
