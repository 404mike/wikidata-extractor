He worked in the nursery business established by his father and illustrated nearly 2000 plates of plants in the nursery's own periodical, the Botanical Cabinet published between 1817 and 1833.

Along with his brother William, George also trained in the trade of plants and the management of nurseries. The family managed special greenhouses and a 9 acre arboretum for tropical plants and were reputed for their collections of palms and orchids. George Loddiges was involved in establishing the Abney Park cemetery garden in 1839-40. The Loddiges worked with plant collectors from around the world as well as botanists. Hugh Cuming was one of their collectors and Nathaniel Ward was a friend. Several species of plant have been named after members of the Loddiges family.Loddiges was a member of the councils of the Linnean Society, the Horticultural Society, and the Microscopical Society.
