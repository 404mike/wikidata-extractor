Although he was back in the side for the next three seasons, his appearances were now less regular and he only played eight times in 1955\u201356, with Len Wills and Joe Wade competing for the same place. With age as well as past injury now counting against him, he retired from playing in the summer of 1956. In all, he played 294 matches and scored 12 goals (he was often the club's designated penalty taker)."]}, {"page": "Billy McCullough", "response": ["Born in Carrickfergus, McCullough first played for Portadown, before being signed in 1958 for \u00a35,000 by London club Arsenal.  A left back, he soon made his debut for the club, against Luton Town on 26 December 1958. He only played ten matches that season, but after Len Wills was moved to right back at the start of 1959-60, McCullough became Arsenal's' regular left back."]}, {"page": "Joe Wade (footballer)", "response": ["Barnes had badly injured his knee in the 1952 FA Cup Final, and Wade duly filled in for him for the whole of the 1952-53 season. Wade was a near ever-present and played 44 times as Arsenal won their seventh league title, pipping Preston North End on goal average; it would turn out to be their last trophy until 1970. However, the following season, 1953-54, Wade himself injured his knee in a floodlit friendly against Queens Park Rangers and after recovering, he struggled to take his place back off Len Wills and a now-recovered Barnes. He continued to flit in and out of the first team but spent all of the 1955-56 season in the reserve side, at the same time carrying out a role as coach of the Arsenal youth team."]}, {"page": "Eddie Magill", "response": ["Magill began his career with Portadown but moved to London club Arsenal in May 1959. He made his debut for the side against Sheffield Wednesday on 19 December 1959. A right back, he was seen as a potential replacement for the injured Dennis Evans and played for most of the rest of that season, but lost his place in 1960-61 to Len Wills and Dave Bacuzzi. He regained the right-back spot the following season, 1961-62, sharing it with Bacuzzi, before securing the place for good in 1962-63. In the meantime, he made his debut for Northern Ireland, and won 26 caps for his country in total."]}, {"page": "Stan Charlton", "response": ["In November 1955 Charlton joined Arsenal with Orient teammate Vic Groves for \u00a330,000, and succeeded Len Wills as the club's first-choice right back. He made his debut on 24 December 1955 against Chelsea and remained in the same position for mostly the rest of the season. Charlton was also an ever-present figure for the club in the 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358 seasons, and played for the London XI in both legs of the semi-finals of the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Lausanne Sports."]}, {"page": "Dave Bacuzzi", "response": ["Bacuzzi signed as amateur for Arsenal in March 1958 and then as a professional in May 1959.

During the 1961\u201362 season he shared the right-back position with Eddie Magill, playing 22 games. The following season, he lost his place and, as Magill became the first-choice right-back, Bacuzzi only played another 11 first-team matches during 1962\u201363 and 1963\u201364 seasons. He did, however, help Arsenal Reserves win the Football Combination in 1962\u201363.
