Following his articles he worked for William Burn, before striking out to his own practice at Charlotte Row, Mansion House, London in 1854.During his career Penfold was made President of the Architectural Association School of Architecture (1859\u20131860) and an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, becoming a fellow in 1881.
