One of its central aims \u2014 the removal of secrecy surrounding family courts \u2014 is the subject of active political debate.

In a landmark ruling in September 2013, Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales, spoke in support of previously 'secret' courts being exposed to public scrutiny, with an order that permitted a family whose children had been removed to speak publicly about their treatment by child safety officials."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["* Sir James Munby (b. 1948)"]}, {"page": "Court of Protection", "response": ["As of April 2017, the President of the Court of Protection was Sir James Munby, who is also President of the Family Division, and the Vice-President was Sir William Charles."]}, {"page": "President of the Family Division", "response": ["The current President of the Family Division is Sir Andrew McFarlane.
