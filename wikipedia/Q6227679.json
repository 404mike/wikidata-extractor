In 1960, Edinburgh City Hospital physician Sir John Crofton, addressed the Royal College of Physicians in London with a lecture titled \"Tuberculosis Undefeated\", and proposed that \"the disease could be conquered, once and for all\". With his colleagues at Edinburgh, he recognised that germs that developed only a mild resistance to one drug was significant. His team showed that when treating new cases of TB, strict compliance to a combination of three therapies, or the triple therapy, (streptomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid and isoniazid) could provide a complete cure. It became known as the 'Edinburgh method' and became standard treatment for at least 15 years. In the 1970s it was recognised that combining isoniazid and rifampin could reduce the duration of treatment from 18 to nine months, and in the 1980s the duration of treatment was further shortened by adding pyrazinamide."]}, {"page": "Crofton, Cumbria", "response": ["Notable landmarks were Crofton Place, the seat of Sir Wastel Brisco, Bart.
