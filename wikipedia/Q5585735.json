While with Brentford, a persistent ankle injury forced Riddick to retire from football in September 1976, but he re-joined the club on a non-contract basis the following month and made 17 further appearances before leaving again in February 1977. In addition to football, Riddock played Minor Counties Championship cricket for Hertfordshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Riddick", "response": ["* Gordon Riddick (born 1943), English former professional football player "]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["With Brentford one place above the re-election zone after seven league matches, manager Everitt began recruiting new players, including defender Gordon Riddick for a \u00a34,000 fee and loanees Michael Brown and Hughie Reed. The signings had no immediate impact and Brentford sank to the bottom of the Football League after a 4\u20131 defeat to Scunthorpe United at the Old Showground. The loss meant that Brentford became the first club to occupy both first and last places in the Football League, having risen to top position during the early months of the 1937\u201338 season. Behind the scenes, the Brentford board had split into two factions, with one side pushing for a move to a new stadium and the other half wishing to stay at Griffin Park. Joint-chairmen Les Davey and Walter Wheatley were split on the matter and Wheatley became sole chairman of the club in January 1974, though he would be ousted two months later.", "|Gordon Riddick (c)", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gordon Riddick", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gordon Riddick", "| Gordon Riddick"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Gordon Riddick (c)", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gordon Riddick", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gordon Riddick"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Gordon Riddick", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gordon Riddick", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gordon Riddick"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Gordon Riddick", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gordon Riddick", "| Gordon Riddick", "| Gordon Riddick", "| Gordon Riddick"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 in English football", "response": ["*24 August 2018: Gordon Riddick, 74, Luton Town, Gillingham and Brentford midfielder."]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Gordon Riddick, 74, English footballer (Luton Town, Gillingham, Brentford)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2018", "response": ["*Gordon Riddick, 74, English footballer (Luton Town, Gillingham, Brentford F.C.).Gordon Riddick RIP"]}]}}
