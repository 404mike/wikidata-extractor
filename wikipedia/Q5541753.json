The sudden death of his father in 1915 forced the family to move to Sheffield, where he spent the rest of his life, never forgetting his country roots. After leaving Sheffield Central School in 1923, he devoted himself to a musical career. While financial circumstances prevented his university matriculation, he nevertheless obtained degrees through external study, including those of Bachelor and Doctor of Music.\nFor many years, Linstead was the music critic of the Sheffield Telegraph. He was a music lecturer at Sheffield University, an organist and choirmaster (latterly at Christ Church, Fulwood, Sheffield), and for many years contributed program notes for the Philharmonic concerts. His numerous compositions included works for orchestra, solo instrument, piano, Organ (music), and choir. Some of these were performed by the Halle Orchestra and received their first public hearing in the City Hall. Several of these compositions have a local connection, including his Symphonic Study \u201cDoveridge\u201d, his arrangement of the Castleton Garland Dance, and his film music for \u201cEngineers in Steel\u201d, commissioned for the British Steel Corporation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheffield Telegraph", "response": ["Notable staff at the Telegraph have included Sir Harold Evans, who was later PRO to Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, and head of ITV News Service (not to be confused with another Harold Evans, the former editor of The Sunday Times); author Peter Tinniswood; novelists John Harris and J.L.
