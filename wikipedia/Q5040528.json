Six minutes into the second half, Pack's  low strike was just wide of the Crewe goal.  A mistake from Dugdale saw Mohamed run through on goal in the 54th minute, but Phillips made the save.  A free kick from Westwood in the 71st minute found Dugdale in the Cheltenham penalty area but his control was poor and allowed Brown to block his shot.  In the 75th minute, Cheltenham made their first substitution of the match with Duffy coming on to replace Goulding.  Pack's long-range strike then went of Crewe's goal before Powell was substituted for Clayton.  Byron Moore's 81st minute shot was just wide of the Cheltenham's right-hand goalpost but a minute later his shot into the bottom-corner of the net after exchanged passes with Leitch-Smith made it 2\u20130.  In the 83rd minute, Cheltenham made a double-substitution, with Russell Penn and Spencer coming on for Pack and Burgess.  Soon after Carl Martin came on for Leitch-Smith before Brown made saves from both Moore and Clayton.  Deep into stoppage time, Bell came on for Moore and the final whistle was blown, Crewe winning 2\u20130 and gaining promotion to League One.", "|DF ||15||Carl Martin || || "]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season", "response": ["*1 June 2012: The club announce that they will be releasing David Artell, Lee Bell, Carl Martin, Danny Shelley, Jordan Brown, Jason Oswell, Caspar Hughes, Michael Koral, Danny Ting and Jordan Connerton.", "|DF|| Carl Martin|| Macclesfield Town|||Free||1 June 2012||"]}, {"page": "Carl Clarke Martin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carl Martin"]}]}}
