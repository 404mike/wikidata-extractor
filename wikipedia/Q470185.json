A box office failure, the film grossed $6,424,112 in the United States on a $13 million budget. It used to have a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, whose critical consensus notes that it is \"duly infamous\" as both an imitation of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and a marketing vehicle for McDonald's and Coca-Cola (the filmmakers had admitted a profit-sharing arrangement with the former). One scene features a large, impromptu dance-off with the alien (dressed in a teddy bear costume), a football team, Ronald McDonald, and various other people inside and outside of a McDonald's restaurant. Leonard Maltin described the film as being \"more like a TV commercial than a movie\", and Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle called it a \"shameless E.T. knockoff\". Mac and Me is widely regarded as one of the worst films ever made, with The Telegraph reporting that it is \"frequently pulled out in 'worst film of all time' arguments\". Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (responsible for the 2004 Oscar-nominated Super Size Me) declared it the \"worst thing you'll ever see in your entire life\", as well as the most egregious example of product placement in cinema history. The film was also named the worst ever in the San Francisco Chronicle, as well as by broadcaster Simon Mayo and writer/producer Damon Lindelof. Michael Hayden of GQ India referred to it as \"hands down the worst family movie in Hollywood history\". The film was nominated for four Razzie Awards including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and won two trophies: Worst Director for Stewart Raffill (tied with Blake Edwards for Sunset) and Worst New Star for Ronald McDonald in a cameo. Mac and Me has however gained a cult following and was featured on the second season of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 revival (the only Razzie-winning film ever to be riffed in the history of the show).\u2018Mystery Science Theater 3000\u2019 Will Tackle \u2018Mac And Me\u2019 In Season 2 - UPROXX"]}, {"page": "9th Golden Raspberry Awards", "response": ["File:STEWART RAFFILL.png|Stewart Raffill, Worst Director co-winner.", "| style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" |Stewart Raffill for Mac and Me (TIE)", "|Mac and Me, written by Stewart Raffill and Steve Feke"]}, {"page": "The Philadelphia Experiment (film)", "response": ["The Philadelphia Experiment is a 1984 American science fiction film.
