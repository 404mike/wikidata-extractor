The castle was at first a simple oblong building, defended at ground floor level by loopholes for bowmen, and having an upper floor, presumably entered by an outside wooden stair. Its date might have been either in the reign of John or in that of his successor, Henry III. Later in the thirteenth century, the building (which may have been left unfinished) was completed with the addition of a north-west corner turret and south wing, and its defence was moved from the ground floor to crenellated parapets at roof level; at that point the loopholes no longer needed to be carefully built up, except one which was enlarged to light a chamber with a fireplace. Later a north-east turret was added, the south-west corner was strengthened, and an enclosure made on the south scarp of the castle hill. The building continued in habitation till the sixteenth century or later, as is proved by the helmet, sword point, and 'fairy' tobacco pipes found under the debris of the north-west turret in 1888; however, it had become a ruin before Camden visited it in the reign of James I. The Armstrongs' map shows it as a ruin, and apparently during the eighteenth century the roofless walls collapsed and all visible and easily accessible stones were removed to help build Dally Mill. At any rate, when John Hodgson visited Dally he could see no masonry above the turf.", "The north and south sides of the building have double base courses externally, but these are not returned across the gables. From the south-east corner, a wall  thick ran down the south scarp of the hill all the way to a ditch which runs in a curve all round castle and hill, passing through the two already mentioned gaps in the kaim. From the existing remains we know that the ground floor of the castle had central pillars macing a longitudinal beam on which the first floor joists rested, their ends being notched to  runners supported on corbels (see details). On the upper floor there was a central colonnade, with responds at the ends, supporting either arches or more probably a timber framework to carry the roof. At the west end of the first floor was a fireplace flanked by detached columns with attached moulded caps and bases. Somewhere also at the west end was a neat chimney head with four small outlets for smoke, and if this was really David de Lindsay's stronghold we know from Hugh of Bolbec's description that it had parapet walks round its roof. The existence of parapets is not necessarily confirmed by the presence of several lengths of  stone channels, but with the blocking up of the loopholes it became almost essential to provide parapets, if only on the turrets."]}, {"page": "William de Lindsay", "response": ["*David de Lindsay of Crawford and Ercildum (died 1214), married Marjorie de Huntingdon, had issue."]}, {"page": "Henry de Pinkeney", "response": ["Henry married Alice, daughter of David de Lindsay, Justiciar of Lothian and Marjorie of Huntingdon, they are known to have had the following issue:"]}]}}
