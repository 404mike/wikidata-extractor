He suffered career-ending injuries to his spinal cord and vertebrae and is paralyzed below the shoulders.\nRecent reports have shown that he can shrug his shoulders, move his toes, his index fingers, and his thumbs.Murray was a seven-time expert British champion and six-time UK National champion before the age of 16. During his professional BMX career, Murray was known for his double back flips, 360 back flips, and turndown back flips.  He won the gold medal in BMX Dirt in the Summer 2001 X Games and won gold medals in BMX Dirt at the Gravity Games in back-to-back years (2001 and 2002). He was nominated for ESPN 'BMX rider of the year'.\nMurray is no longer married, but has full custody of his two sons. He resides in Evesham, England\nSince the accident, Murray worked closely with the doctor who treated Christopher Reeve after the actor's accident left him quadriplegic. He now has limited movement in his toes and is also gaining more movements in his hands. He hopes to move to a hand-operated wheelchair in the future.\nMore recently, Murray has been on the True Geordie Podcast to talk more openly about his experience, and the journey of his life. His motivations and dealing with the crash are explored too, in a long but successful interview. In 2017, a book talk about his life: Staying Strong: An Immensely Human Story (with John F. McDonald, Lee Martin).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "X Games", "response": ["* Stephen Murray lands the first double backflip in Bike Stunt Dirt and wins the gold medal with Ryan Nyquist taking the Silver and T.J.
