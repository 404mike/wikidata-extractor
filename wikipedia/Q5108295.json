Toumazou is also Chief Scientist of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Professor of Circuit Design at Imperial; Founder of Toumaz Holdings Ltd, Executive chairman and founder of DNA Electronics Ltd., Chief Scientific Advisor to GENEU and a co-founder of DNAnudge.He has been involved in developing new technologies, mainly in medical field, creating a research institute and a number of commercial ventures to commercialise his research. Toumazou invented and licensed Portable and Rapid Semiconductor Genome Sequencing which has now become a multimillion-dollar industry. One of his motivators was the diagnosis of his 13-year-old son with end stage kidney failure through a rare genetic mutation.He has published over 500 research papers and holds 50 patents in the field of semiconductors and healthcare. Toumazou's career began with the invention and development of novel concept of current-mode analogue circuitry for ultra-low-power electronic devices.\nFor his inventions on semiconductor based genetic testing he won the Gabor Medal of the Royal Society (2013) and European Inventor Award (2014). He is the first British winner of the prize in this contest since 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Electronics Letters", "response": ["In 1965, the British engineer and professor Peter Clarricoats, along with the association of Institution of Electrical Engineers, pioneered a peer-reviewed platform out of the necessity to quickly disseminate the latest researches in the field of electrical and electronic engineering.

The City & Guilds College, along with the other constituent colleges, ceased to exist as a separate entity. In September 2013 the Mechanical and Aeronautical engineering building at Imperial College was renamed City and Guilds Building to acknowledge the historical legacy. The name of the constituent college also survives in the City & Guilds College Union (CGCU) \u2014 the student union for the Imperial College Faculty of Engineering and the Imperial College Business School. In January 2013, the Queen endowed a Regius Professor of Engineering at the college. The first chair was Chris Toumazou, professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. In September of the same year, the Mechanical Engineering Building was renamed the City and Guilds Building (CAGB) to honour the links between Imperial College and the City and Guilds College. After an extensive refurbishment, the City and Guilds Building now houses the Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics departments. In 2014 the Dyson School of Design Engineering was founded following a \u00a312m donation by the James Dyson Foundation to the college, being the first new engineering division at Imperial for two decades. The school took over the old Met Office building from the Science Museum on the corner of Imperial College Road and Exhibition Road."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2008", "response": ["#Chris Toumazou", "#Chris Toumazou"]}, {"page": "The Life Scientific", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Toumazou, Chris\"| Chris Toumazou"]}, {"page": "Professor Chris Toumazou", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Toumazou"]}]}}
