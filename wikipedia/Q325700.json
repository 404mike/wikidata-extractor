His acting career spanned 36 years, including starring roles in numerous theatre and television productions. He played Captain Mainwaring in the British sitcom Dad's Army from 1968 until 1977, was nominated for seven BAFTAs and became one of the most recognised faces on UK television.\nLowe began acting professionally in England in 1945, after army service in the Second World War. He worked in theatre, film and television throughout the 1950s, but it was not until he landed the part of Leonard Swindley in the television soap Coronation Street in 1960 that he came to popular attention. He played the character until 1966, while continuing theatre and other acting work. In 1968 he took on his role in Dad's Army, written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. His success in this part led to further high-profile character roles. Despite increasingly poor health in his final years, he maintained a busy professional schedule until his death from a stroke on 15 April 1982, aged 66.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 15", "response": ["*1982 \u2013 Arthur Lowe, English actor (b. 1915)"]}, {"page": "Coronation Street", "response": ["Coronation Street and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some of its current and recent cast based loosely on former characters.

In 1966 Le Mesurier also played the role of Colonel Maynard in the ITV sitcom George and the Dragon, with Sid James and Peggy Mount.

His interaction with Arthur Lowe's character Captain George Mainwaring was described by The Times as \"a memorable part of one of television's most popular shows\". Tise Vahimagi, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, agreed, and commented that \"it was the hesitant exchanges of one-upmanship between Le Mesurier's Wilson, a figure of delicate gentility, and Arthur Lowe's pompous, middle class platoon leader Captain Mainwaring, that added to its finest moments\". Le Mesurier enjoyed making the series, particularly the fortnight the cast would spend in Thetford each year filming the outside scenes. The programme lasted for nine series over nine years, and covered eighty episodes, ending in 1977.", "During the filming of the series in 1969, Le Mesurier was flown to Venice over a series of weekends to appear in the film Midas Run, an Alf Kjellin-directed crime film that also starred Richard Crenna, Anne Heywood and Fred Astaire.

In 1971 Norman Cohen directed a feature film of Dad's Army; Le Mesurier also appeared as Wilson in a stage adaptation, which toured the UK in 1975\u201376. Following the success of Dad's Army, Le Mesurier recorded the single \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\" with \"Hometown\" on the reverse side (the latter with Arthur Lowe).

The death of Lowe in April 1982 meant that only a pilot episode was recorded, and the project was suspended. It was revived later that year with Lowe's role replaced by two other Dad's Army cast members: Pike, played by Ian Lavender, and Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee. A pilot and twelve episodes were subsequently recorded, and broadcast in 1984. Le Mesurier also teamed up with another ex-Dad's Army colleague, Clive Dunn, to record a novelty single, \"There Ain't Much Change from a Pound These Days\"/\"After All These Years\", which had been written by Le Mesurier's stepson, David Malin.

Corbett) are pretentious, would-be intellectuals who find themselves trapped by the squalor of their lives.
