He started his career as an esports caster at gaming tournaments, working his first event shoutcasting Battlefield 1942 (short: BF1942). The 3D World War II first-person shooter (FPS) video game was coincidentally also the first game Miller played at a competitive level. At age sixteen, he began to commentate BF1942 games at home in the UK, pushing out as many audio commentaries as he could. In an interview with JP McDaniel (host of Real Talk on YouTube), Miller revealed that it was a \"big jump\" from the audio commentaries he initially produced to the audio-video commentaries we are accustomed to today.Miller's big break came when he joined TsN, through which he cast the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) World Tour in 2005, arguably the \"most definitive moment\" of his early esports career. From there he went on to work as a broadcaster for numerous professional video game leagues including the World Series of Video Games (WSVG), Championship Gaming Series, DreamHack and various Electronic Sports League (ESL) events. In amongst these achievements he worked as General Manager for Fnatic back when they were based in Southampton as well as joining the QuadV team, headed by fellow casters Leigh \"Deman\" Smith and Paul \u201cReDeYe\u201d Chaloner.Although Miller is known for casting competitive Counter-Strike and Quake Live tournaments, recently he has made a name for himself in League of Legends (LoL). Miller moved to Cologne, Germany and began working for the ESL in 2008 with Matt Rider and James Harding. He secured a regular spot casting weekly League of Legends Championship Series, which he did alongside the likes of Leigh \"Deman\" Smith, Trevor \u201cQu1ksh0t\u201d Henry,  Jason Kaplan, Martin \"Deficio\" Lynge and Eefje \u201csjokz\u201d Depoortere. Miller currently resides in Cologne, Germany and speaks fluent German.Notable recent achievements include casting the Riot League of Legends tournaments at Gamescom 2013 and securing a casting position at LoL World Championships hosted in Los Angeles. It was recently announced soon after the European LoL Regionals at Gamescom 2014 that he would also be casting at the 2014 League of Legends World Championship in Taipei, Singapore and the South Korean cities of Busan and Seoul.On 3 December 2014 Miller announced he would be leaving the EU LCS production.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Miller", "response": ["Joseph or Joe Miller may refer to:", "*Joe Miller (Alaska politician) (born 1967), 2010 Republican and 2016 Libertarian nominee for U.S. Senate in Alaska", "*Joe Miller (North Dakota politician), American politician in the North Dakota Senate", "*Joe Miller (Ohio politician), American politician elected to Ohio House of Representatives in 2018", "*Joe Miller (second baseman) (1850\u20131891), Major League Baseball player", "*Joe Miller (shortstop) (1861\u20131928), Major League Baseball player", "*Joe Miller (footballer) (born 1967), former Scottish footballer", "*Joe Miller (ice hockey) (1898\u20131963), Canadian ice hockey player", "*Joe Miller (commentator) (born 1987), electronic sports commentator", "*Joe Miller (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s and 1910s for Great Britain, England, and Wigan", "*Joe Miller (golfer) (born 1984), British long drive golfer", "*Joe Miller (actor) (1684\u20131738), English actor, the namesake of the 18th-century jokebook Joe Miller's Jests"]}, {"page": "Matt Rider", "response": ["In 2008 he relocated to Cologne, Germany to work for Electronic Sports League as host and editor with James \"2GD\" Harding and Joe Miller (commentator).
