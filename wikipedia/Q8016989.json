From 1886 to 1902, he served as general manager of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSL&R), which was renamed Great Central Railway in 1897. He was knighted in 1899 and appointed High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1908.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Quainton Road railway station", "response": ["Following Watkin's retirement relations between the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly.

In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began construction of a new line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5\u00a0km) north of Quainton Road.

It was from here that he was appointed by Lord Faringdon, Chairman of the Great Central Railway, to succeed Sir William Pollitt as General Manager of the line in 1902. The Great Central was at that time in a precarious financial position due to the costs of constructing its London Extension, yet Fay was confident in his ability to repeat his performance with the M&SWJ. He was to be paid \u00a33,000 per year and his contract was subject to six months notice on either side.Dow, p. 28. Presumably as a result of his experience with the M&SWJR, Fay appears to have been head-hunted to become General Manager of the Great Central Railway. Whilst he was successful in maintaining the Great Central as an effective railway, Fay was not able completely to turn round the financial position of the company."]}, {"page": "Brill Tramway", "response": ["Following Watkin's retirement, relations between the Great Central Railway and the Metropolitan Railway deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over MR lines from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the shaky goodwill of the MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway to create a second route into London. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began construction of a new line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR's existing station at Princes Risborough to the new Great Central line. The line ran from Princes Risborough north to meet the Great Central at Grendon Underwood, about  north of Quainton Road. The new line was to cross the Tramway on a bridge immediately east of Wotton station; no intersection was built between the lines. A temporary siding was built from the Tramway onto the embankment of the new line, and was used for the transport of construction materials and the removal of spoil from the works during the building of the new line. The line was formally an independent company, but in practice was operated as part of the Great Central Railway."]}, {"page": "Pollitt", "response": ["* William Pollitt, British railway manager (1842\u20131908)"]}, {"page": "Harry Pollitt (engineer)", "response": ["Pollitt was born on 26 December 1864 at Altrincham, Cheshire.

His successors as the prime movers were William Pollitt (MS&LR) and John Bell (Metropolitan) and their personal relationship was not cordial. From that time relations between the MS&LR and the Metropolitan Railway cooled, and became hostile and obstructive. Excessive charges and an unrealistic proposal for working mineral traffic from Baker Street to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway started the downward trajectory of the relationship.George Dow, Great Central: volume II, Locomotive Publishing Company Ltd, London, 1962", "The Metropolitan Railway had reached Aylesbury in 1892 and had taken over the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway in 1891, thereby gaining a route between Aylesbury and Verney Junction via Quainton Road. However the Great Western Railway had sponsored the Wycombe Railway, which had been the first railway in Aylesbury: its branch from Princes Risborough reached there in 1863. In 1898 the GCR wished to send coal trains to London over the GWR Aylesbury to Princes Risborough line, and on 30 July 1898 the first such train approached Aylesbury. This was one day earlier than the agreed start date. John Bell, the General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway and William Pollitt was General Manager of the MS&LR. Bell personally went to Quainton Road and took charge, blocking the onward journey of the train. In fact he even refused to allow the engine to draw forward to run round its train; propelling a long mineral train back wrong line was out of the question, and a major disruption occurred. The mineral traffic started the following day.Dennis F Edwards and Ron Pigram, The Final Link, Midas Books, Tunbridge Wells, 1982,  He had earlier refused to allow these trains to run the relatively short distance from Quainton Road to Aylesbury until the GCR London Extension was open throughout its length. This obstruction for the sake of one day was the clearest indication that the Metropolitan Railway was not going to be a co-operative partner to the GCR. This was compounded by Bell's absolute refusal to allow mineral traffic to be worked to the GWR at Aylesbury, not to destinations south of London over its own system."]}, {"page": "Sir William Pollitt", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pollitt"]}, {"page": "Eydon Road Halt railway station", "response": ["In 1893, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR) obtained Parliamentary approval for the extension of its line from Annesley in Nottingham to London.
