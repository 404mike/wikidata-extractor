It is often thought that this was the earlier of the two types, possibly originating in the 1520s, although the matter is not certain, and it seems clear that both types continued to be produced until late in Titian's career, and developing details in the Prado type composition appear in Farnese versions.Penny, 283; Boy, 39"]}, {"page": "Catherine Read", "response": ["When the war ended at the Battle of Culloden and with family friends fleeing to France, Read\u2019s family was prompted to follow suit for their association and support of the Jacobite cause through her uncle.

Its sponsors were the elder Norie, the poet Allan Ramsay and William Adam. Other members included Cooper's student Robert Strange, the two younger Nories, the portrait painters John Alexander (c. 1690-c. 1733) and Allan Ramsay, son of the poet (1713\u201384).Smart, The Life and Art of Allan Ramsay, p. 11. The Academy grew out of Richard Cooper's collaboration in the University of Edinburgh with the anatomist, Alexander Monro primus (1697-1767) where he and a minor artist, William Robertson (or Robinson) drew and engraved anatomical specimens for publication in the Medical Essays between 1733 and 45. The success of the group was limited somewhat by its associations with Jacobitism, with Strange printing bank notes for the rebels, but critically it provided facilities for drawing from the life, in Monro's anatomy classroom until Cooper's death in 1764.Brydall, Robert, Art in Scotland: Its Origin and Progress (Edinburgh 1889) pp. 110-11.
