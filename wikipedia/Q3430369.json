This theory is supported by turkologist Henryk Jankowski. Central Asian scholar Christopher I. Beckwith notes that the Xiongnu name could be a cognate of Scythian, Saka and Sogdia, corresponding to a name for Northern Iranians.: \"Accordingly, the transcription now read as Hsiung- nu may have been pronounced * So\u03b3d\u00e2, * So\u03b3l\u00e2, * Sak(a)d\u00e2, or even * Skla(C)da, etc.\" According to Beckwith the Xiongnu could have contained a leading Iranian component when they started out, but more likely they had earlier been subjects of an Iranian people and learned the Iranian nomadic model from them."]}, {"page": "Sarmatians", "response": ["English scholar Harold Walter Bailey (1899\u20131996) derived the base word from Avestan sar- (to move suddenly) from tsar- in Old Iranian (tsarati, tsaru-, hunter), which also gave its name to the western Avestan region of Sairima (*salm, \u2013 *Sairmi), and also connected it to the tenth\u2013eleventh century AD Persian epic Shahnamehs character \"Salm\"."]}, {"page": "Saka", "response": ["Ren\u00e9 Grousset wrote of the migration of the Saka: \"the Saka, under pressure from the Yueh-chih [Yuezhi], overran Sogdiana and then Bactria, there taking the place of the Greeks.\"  Then, \"Thrust back in the south by the Yueh-chih,\" the Saka occupied \"the Saka country, Sakastana, whence the modern Persian Seistan.\" Some of the Saka fleeing the Yuezhi attacked the Parthian Empire, where they defeated and killed the kings Phraates II and Artabanus. These Sakas were eventually settled by Mithridates II in what become known as Sakastan. According to Harold Walter Bailey, the territory of Drangiana (now in Afghanistan and Pakistan) became known as \"Land of the Sakas\", and was called Sakast\u0101na in the Persian language of contemporary Iran, in Armenian as Sakastan, with similar equivalents in Pahlavi, Greek, Sogdian, Syriac, Arabic, and the Middle Persian tongue used in Turfan, Xinjiang, China. This is attested in a contemporary Kharosthi inscription found on the Mathura lion capital belonging to the Saka kingdom of the Indo-Scythians (200 BC \u2013 400 AD) in North India, roughly the same time the Chinese record that the Saka had invaded and settled the country of Jibin \u7f7d\u8cd3 (i.e. Kashmir, of modern-day India and Pakistan).Ulrich Theobald.

Frye reports that the word \"was probably foreign to Sogdian\", Gerhard Doerfer points out that even in Turkic languages, its plural is not Turkic (sing. tarxan --> plur. tarxat), suggesting a non-Turkic origin. L. Ligeti comes to the same conclusion, saying that \"tarxan and tegin [prince] form the wholly un-Turkish plurals tarxat and tegit\" and that the word was unknown to medieval western Turkic languages, such as Bulgar. Taking this into consideration, the word may be derived from medieval Mongolian  (plural suffix -at), itself perhaps derived from the earlier Sogdian word * ('free of taxes'). A. Alemany gives the additional elaboration that the related East Iranian Scythian (and Alanic) word * still survives in Ossetic  ('argument, trial') and  ('to judge'). Harold Walter Bailey also proposes an Iranian (Khotanese Saka) root for the word, L. Rogers and Edwin G. Pulleyblank argue that the word may have originated among the Xiongnu, as a pronunciation of the word recorded in Old Chinese as chanyu, which Pulleyblank argues may have originally represented a Chinese approximation of d\u0101n-\u0125w\u0101\u0125 for *darxan.Universit\u00e4t Bonn.
