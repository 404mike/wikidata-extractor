If the manager wants a recommendation from me, Michael gets it.\" Owen also declared his aim was \"a first-team place in the next year or so\". Karl-Heinz Riedle, who prior to joining Liverpool in the summer of 1997 had never heard of Owen, declared, \"It's unbelievable when you see him play to realise that he's only 17,\" he said. \"He's such a good player, so very quick and for his age he has excellent vision and awareness. He's a great player already and in one or two years he will become a very great player.\" Owen was rated as \"the best attacker of his age in the country\" in January 1997. Ted Powell, the championship-winning coach of the England under-18 side, declared Owen to be the best of a generation of young players that included Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Robbie Fowler."]}, {"page": "Wycombe Wanderers F.C.", "response": ["|Ted Powell"]}, {"page": "Index of Malawi-related articles", "response": ["Ted Powell (National football coach, 1977\u201383) - "]}, {"page": "Sutton Grammar School", "response": ["*Ted Powell \u2013 Team GB footballer and coach of England under-18 and Malawi national football teams"]}, {"page": "Sutton United F.C.", "response": ["Unfortunately, the next decade proved to be one of little success for the club and Sutton went through a succession of managers, including Ted Powell and Dario Gradi, both of whom played for the team and went on to manage at higher levels.
