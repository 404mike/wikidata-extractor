His 36-year career as a schoolmaster overlapped with his career as a music critic and author of books on Elizabethan drama, and opera and concert singers.\nAmong Steane's works are critical studies of Christopher Marlowe and Alfred Tennyson, and a series of books on music, concentrating on singing and singers. He contributed to a range of musical journals, including Gramophone and The Musical Times, and wrote articles for the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Marlowe", "response": ["As with other Elizabethans, little is known about Marlowe's adult life. All available evidence, other than what can be deduced from his literary works, is found in legal records and other official documents. This has not stopped writers of fiction and non-fiction from speculating about his professional activities, private life and character. Marlowe has often been described as a spy, a brawler and a heretic, as well as a \"magician\", \"duellist\", \"tobacco-user\", \"counterfeiter\" and \"rakehell\". While J. A. Downie and Constance Kuriyama have argued against the more lurid speculations, it is the usually circumspect J. B. Steane who remarked, \"it seems absurd to dismiss all of these Elizabethan rumours and accusations as 'the Marlowe myth.Downie, J. A. and J. T. Parnell. Constructing Christopher Marlowe (2000) To understand his brief adult life, from 1587 to 1593, much has been written, including speculation of: his involvement in royally sanctioned espionage; his vocal declaration as an atheist; his private, and possibly same-sex, sexual interests; and the puzzling circumstances surrounding his death.", "J. B. Steane considered there to be \"no evidence for Marlowe's homosexuality at all\". Other scholars point to the frequency with which Marlowe explores homosexual themes in his writing: in Hero and Leander, Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander: \"in his looks were all that men desire...\"Hero and Leander, 88 (see Project Gutenberg).Hero and Leander, 157\u2013192.Hero and Leander, 192\u2013193.

Steane in 1969; edited by Frank Romany and Robert Lindsey, Revised Edition, 2004, Penguin)"]}, {"page": "Countertenor", "response": ["The vocal range of a countertenor is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types. A trained countertenor will typically have a vocal center similar in placement to that of a contralto or mezzo-soprano. Peter Giles, a professional countertenor and noted author on the subject, defines the countertenor as a musical part rather than as a vocal style or mechanism.  In modern usage, the term \"countertenor\" is essentially equivalent to the medieval term contratenor altus (see above).  In this way, a countertenor singer can be operationally defined as a man who sings the countertenor part, whatever vocal style or mechanism is employed. The countertenor range is generally equivalent to an alto range, extending from approximately G3 to D5 or E5.J. B. Steane, \"Countertenor\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, I, p. 999. In comparison to female voices the male voice usually has an extended range towards the low notes, but the lowest parts of the range are usually not used.  In actual practice, it is generally acknowledged that a majority of countertenors sing with a falsetto vocal production for at least the upper half of this range, although most use some form of \"chest voice\" (akin to the range of their speaking voice) for the lower notes.  The most difficult challenge for such a singer is managing the lower middle range, for there are normally a few notes (around B3) that can be sung with either vocal mechanism, and the transition between registers must somehow be blended or smoothly managed."]}, {"page": "Nellie Melba", "response": ["Some writers expressed surprise at Melba's playing the last of these roles, since it was merely a supporting part in the opera. She played it on many occasions, saying in her memoirs, \"Why on earth a prima donna should not sing secondary r\u00f4les I could not see then and am no nearer seeing to-day. I hate the artistic snobbery of it.\" She sang the role opposite the Carmens of Emma Calv\u00e9, Z\u00e9lie de Lussan and Maria Gay.\"Royal Opera\", The Times, 26 November 1906, p. 10 Marguerite de Valois, too, is not the leading female role in Les Huguenots, but Melba was willing to undertake it as seconda donna to Emma Albani. She was generous in support of singers who did not rival her in her favoured roles, but was, as her biographer J. B. Steane put it, \"pathologically critical\" of other lyric sopranos."]}, {"page": "Francesco Tamagno", "response": ["Tamagno's beloved daughter Margherita, who had been born out of wedlock, and for whom he cared from her birth, writing to her throughout his career and her childhood incredibly moving letters, inherited his considerable estate, according to biographer Ugo Piavano. Piavano's definitive biography, Otello Fu: La Vera Vita di Francesco Tamagno, il \"tenore-cannone\", was published in Milan in 2005 by Rugginenti Editore to mark the 100th anniversary of the singer's death. Both Volume One of Michael Scott's The Record of Singing (published by Duckworth, London, 1977) and J. B.

I think Bellini comes closest to everything I believe about the greatness of singing.\" Her Adalgisa in a Met Norma (1975) had the misfortune to be paired with an incongruously cast Wagnerian in the opera's title role. Damning the production as \"a travesty of Bellini's work both musically and dramatically\", Donal Henahan of The New York Times wrote that Rita Hunter's \"monumental proportions and virtual immobility as an actress\" were not mitigated by her shrill top notes, her effortful coloratura in \"Casta diva\" and her being apparently often out of breath.
