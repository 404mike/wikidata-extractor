He sat as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Preston from 1872 until his death ten years later.  He was first Solicitor General and later Attorney General in the second government of Benjamin Disraeli.\nHe was born in Bury, Lancashire and educated at Bury Grammar School.   After being articled to a solicitor, he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1854, where he was later a bencher, and treasurer in 1875.  He joined the Northern Circuit, and lived in Manchester.  He married in 1861 but had no children.  After his first wife died, he remarried in 1874 to Miss Mary Lucia Richardson.  There were no children from either marriage.\nHe returned to London in 1864, where he developed a very successful and lucrative legal practice, and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1866.\nHe was the Conservative candidate at a by-election in Preston in 1872, one of the first held after the Ballot Act 1872 required the use of a secret ballot.  He served as Member of Parliament for Preston until his death in 1882.  He became Solicitor General in the government of Benjamin Disraeli in 1874, and was knighted.  He replaced Sir Richard Baggallay as Attorney General in 1875, retaining in the position until Liberals won the general election in 1880.\nHe was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal in January 1882, but resigned due to ill health in May, and died in London a few days later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Abbott McNeill Whistler", "response": ["Whistler, seeing the attack in the newspaper, replied to his friend George Boughton, \"It is the most debased style of criticism I have had thrown at me yet.\" He then went to his solicitor and drew up a writ for libel which was served to Ruskin. Whistler hoped to recover \u00a31,000 plus the costs of the action. The case came to trial the following year after delays caused by Ruskin's bouts of mental illness, while Whistler's financial condition continued to deteriorate. It was heard in the Exchequer Division of the High Court on November 25 and 26, 1878 before Baron Huddleston and a special jury.Whistler, 2-5; The Times (London, England), Tuesday, November 26, 26, 1878; p. 9.

He found particular fault with Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket, and accused Whistler of asking two hundred guineas for \"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\".Linda Merrill, A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin. \u2013 book review, Art in America, January 1993, by Wendy Steiner  Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin, but Ruskin was ill when the case went to trial in November 1887, so the artist Edward Burne-Jones and Attorney General Sir John Holker represented him. The trial took place on 25 and 26 November, and many major figures of the art world at the time appeared at the trial. Artist Albert Moore appeared as a witness for Whistler, and artist William Powell Frith appeared for Ruskin. Frith said \"the nocturne in black in gold is not in my opinion worth two hundred guineas\". Frederic Leighton also agreed to give evidence for Whistler, but in the end could not attend as he had to go to Windsor to be knighted. Edward Burne-Jones, representing Ruskin, also asserted that Nocturne in Black and Gold was not a serious work of art. When asked to give reasons, Burne-Jones said he had never seen one painting of night that was successful, but also acknowledged that he saw marks of great labour and artistic skill in the painting. In the end, Whistler won the case, but the jury awarded damages of only a derisory farthing (the smallest coin of the realm) to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription organised by the Fine Art Society, but Whistler was bankrupt within six months, and was forced to sell his studio. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, and may have accelerated his mental decline.For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, \"Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity\" in Nineteenth-Century Prose, vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13\u201334. It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in Sesame and Lilies printed in \"blood-red\"."]}, {"page": "Gray's Inn", "response": ["The Library became more important during the 18th century; prior to that it had been a small, little-used collection of books. In 1725 it was proposed by the Pension that \"a publick Library be sett up and kept open for ye use of ye society\",Fletcher (1910) p. xxvi and that more books be purchased. The first order of new books was on 27 June 1729 and consisted of \"a collection of Lord Bacon's works\". In 1750 the Under-Steward of the Inn made a new catalogue of the books, and in 1789 the Library was moved to a new room between the Hall and the Chapel.Fletcher (1910) p. xxvii In 1840 another two rooms were erected in which to store books, and in 1883 a new Library was constructed with space to store approximately 11,000 books.Douthwaite (1886) p. 179 This was rapidly found to be inadequate, and in 1929 a new Library, known as the Holker Library after the benefactor, Sir John Holker, was opened.

As a Lord Justice of Appeal, he was conspicuous for his learning, his industry and his courtesy to all who appeared before him; and in spite of his failing health, he sat regularly until August 1893, when, on the retirement of Lord Hannen, he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and a life peer with the title Baron Bowen, of Colwood in the County of Sussex. By this time, however, his health had finally broken down; he never sat as a law lord to hear appeals, and he gave but one vote as a peer, while his last public service consisted in presiding over the commission which sat in October 1893 to inquire into the Featherstone riots."]}, {"page": "Charles Bradlaugh", "response": ["This Select Committee held only one brief meeting on 12 May 1880.
