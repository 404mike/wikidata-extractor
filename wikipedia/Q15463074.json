He accused them of selling out their heritage and denigrating their fellow-countrymen. Comic Brendan O'Carroll said, \"Whoever wrote the script has obviously never been to Ireland. I'm very disappointed because EastEnders is a programme I have great respect for. It is outrageous and untrue to portray us like that. I'm disappointed the producers allowed it to be broadcast as it was.\" Former jockey and TV presenter Declan Murphy said, \"It's wrong and disgraceful when writers portray everyone from Ireland as backward drunks. I am an Irishman and I'm proud of it, but I'm not a drunk and I'm certainly not backward and neither are my compatriots.\" Actor Garret Keogh, who played an \"ignorant\" Irish hotel owner in the EastEnders episodes, revealed: \"The streets around Cabra, where I live, are hopping. I went down to get the paper and some bread and I was accosted. The script has stirred up a hell of a hornets' nest here.
