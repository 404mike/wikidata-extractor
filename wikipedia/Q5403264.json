She worked closely with many principal geologists and her fossil collection, considered one of the largest at the time, played a part in the development of geology as a field of science. Tsar Nicholas I gave her an honorary doctorate from the University of St. Petersburg at a time when women were not allowed to enter higher education institutions \u2014 but only because he mistook her first name for a male's. How did women like Etheldred Benett and Mary Anning, a younger contemporary, get their start in such an environment? Dr. Martina Koelbl-Ebert, director of the Jura-Museum Eichstatt in Bavaria, believes it was due to a lack of job competition. By the late 18th century, geology had become a scientific discipline in Germany. Alexander von Humboldt, for example, began his career in the Prussian mines department. Women were barred from entering the workforce. Proto-geologists in the United Kingdom were more likely to be self-employed enthusiasts with the financial means to pursue their interests in the field. These men were enthusiastic about women who shared their ideals and could assist them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1845", "response": ["* January 11 \u2013 Etheldred Benett, British geologist (b. 1776)"]}, {"page": "List of geologists", "response": ["* Etheldred Benett (1776\u20131845), English, pioneer paleontologist"]}, {"page": "1776 in science", "response": ["* July 22 \u2013 Etheldred Benett, English geologist (died 1845)"]}, {"page": "1845 in science", "response": ["* January 11 \u2013 Etheldred Benett (born 1776), British geologist.
