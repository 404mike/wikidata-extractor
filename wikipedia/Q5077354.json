The Septuagint may therefore 'correct' the Hebrew text, as other textual evidence also seems to indicate the towns did not fall to the Israelites until much later. Charles Ellicott noted that Josephus had a different solution, claiming in Antiquities of the Jews (volume 2, paragraph 4) that 'Askelon and Ashdod were taken in the war, but that Gaza and Ekron escaped, because their situation in the plains enabled them to use their chariots; yet in 3, \u00a7 1, he says that the Canaanites re-conquered Askelon and Ekron.'"]}, {"page": "Rosalind Ellicott", "response": ["Ellicott was born in Cambridge, the daughter of Constantia Annie Ellicott (n\u00e9e Becher) and Charles Ellicott, the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol.
