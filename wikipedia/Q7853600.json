In an extension of the 1970s feminist statement that \u2018the personal is the political\u2019, they stated that no feminist movement was complete without female sexuality being re-examined, redefined and expressed in whatever shape it took by women themselves. They saw rock music as the perfect medium to do so, as it had been the arena for the expression of masculine sexuality for so long, whereas women's bodies were often a marketing spice to add interest to a product rather than a source of personal empowerment."]}, {"page": "Real Sex", "response": ["| || || \"The Royal Sex Maniacs' Ball\" || Tuppy Owens creates the anything goes Sex Maniacs Ball to raise funds for disabled people.

A chance meeting with the English sex therapist, consultant, campaigner, writer, and former adult model Tuppy Owens led to the \"Sex Maniac's Diary\", a remarkable and successful publication which amazingly sold mainly to women. Their publisher suggested to him creating an erotic comic \"Torrid\" which appeared irregularly during the 1980s. \"Torrid\" was little more than a hobby and he enjoyed total freedom at a time when Swinging London was in its first flush, a fact which influenced all of his stories. He ceased when he discovered the publishers were selling the strips that appeared in the first 16 issues of Torrid and were published later in the French magazines YES and B\u00e9d\u00e9 Adult without his knowledge. This publisher, Lionel Roc, then took up the task of vigorously promoting his work. He became famous as an artist with the works Conte \u00e0 Rebours (for YES), a sci-fi story which was rendered curiously incomprehensible by the circumstances of the translation, and Crimes et D\u00e9lits (the last work succeeding Georges L\u00e9vis) for which he illustrated the section on Rasputin."]}, {"page": "Sensations (film)", "response": ["Sensations is a 1975 pornographic film written by Veronique Monet, directed by Lasse Braun, and starring the writer and Brigitte Maier.
