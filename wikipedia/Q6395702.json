With the Strikers equal top of the league but second on goal difference their final game of the season was abandoned due to wet weather and with the governing body, Football Queensland, choosing not to reschedule the match and deem it a goalless draw they were forced to settle for the runners-up position.  The disappointment from the last game controversy was further heightened when the Strikers qualified for the Grand Final, only to lose to their league rivals Moreton Bay United."]}, {"page": "Rhys Weston", "response": ["Weston then went into an under-21 side that fared poorly in the qualifying round of the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

Noosa scored in the first half and after Kawana's Dylan Firth was sent-off in the second half, Noosa looked to be in control. However, with full-time looming Dylan Fennell equalised for Kawana to send the game into extra-time. During extra-time Brendan Martin, Kawana's goalkeeper saved a penalty and Kawana had Zane Gear and Ryan Smith sent-off reducing them to just 8 players. Noosa made the most of their numerical advantage to score 3 more times and win 4\u20131, their 8th grand final success after a 17-year wait, and their 6th premiership-grand final double. This was Kevin Aherne-Evans first grand final victory as Noosa's manager. Noosa's captain Grant de Chastel was named the player of the match; a match which saw 10 yellow cards (5 for Noosa and 5 for Kawana) and 3 red cards (all Kawana) issued.https://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=69953608&c=1-9393-0-476861-0&pool=1001"]}, {"page": "Aherne-Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kevin Aherne-Evans"]}, {"page": "Kevin A\u2019herne-Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kevin Aherne-Evans"]}, {"page": "Kevin A'herne-Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kevin Aherne-Evans"]}, {"page": "Kevin A'Herne-Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kevin Aherne-Evans"]}]}}
