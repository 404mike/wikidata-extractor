In the 11th minute, Tranmere's goalkeeper Eric Nixon tipped a cross from Storer over the bar.  Three minutes later, Tranmere's Scottish centre forward Jim Steel fell badly and was injured: he was taken off and  substituted for Chris Malkin.  Minutes later, Kenny Irons struck a shot over the Bolton crossbar. Just before half time, Malkin headed in a free kick from John Morrissey, but it was disallowed by Hackett, who adjudged that Tranmere had taken the set piece too quickly.  Five minutes after half-time, another header from Malkin, this time from a Tony Thomas free kick, struck the Bolton crossbar.  Nixon then saved a strike from Julian Darby.  Paul Comstive also missed an opportunity to put Bolton ahead and the match ended 0\u20130, sending it into extra time.", "|4 ||Paul Comstive "]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paul Comstive"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paul Comstive"]}, {"page": "Comstive, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Comstive"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["|Paul Comstive"]}]}}
