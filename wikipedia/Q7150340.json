He has appeared on eight albums with bands, three highly acclaimed solo albums and has over 150 session credits. He has toured every concert venue, theatre and festival in Britain, plus many tours in the USA and Europe, as well as appearing in cabaret in the West Indies and newsreading on US radio.Born in Exeter, Devon, Downes played classical guitar in his youth. He played a solo recital in Westminster Abbey at the age of 16 and subsequently took up folk music. From the age of 12, his best friend was Steve Knightley; then at 16, they met Phil Beer. After giving up a promising academic career, he went on the road as half of the folk duo Downes and Beer.The pair met Bill Zorn, who had just left the Kingston Trio, and formed the Arizona Smoke Revue. When Zorn returned to the states, Downes toured with Pete Seeger before being asked to sit in on the first Joyce Gang gig. The Joyce Gang are an Anglo/Irish roots band with whom Downes has recorded five albums. He still plays with the Joyce Gang and as a solo artist, as well as occasional reunions with Phil Beer and Arizona Smoke Revue.\nDownes has recently formed a collaboration with Mick Ryan, several of whose songs he had previously recorded. Downes plays guitar for Ryan's folk opera The Navvy's Wife and they are toured as a duo in 2009.\nHe is a supporter of Exeter Chiefs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Lenkiewicz", "response": ["The Paul Downes song \"Robert and the Cowboys\" was inspired by the project and describes a number of the vagrants."]}, {"page": "Phil Beer", "response": ["Beer first began to play fiddle, guitar, and mandolin whilst still at school in Teignmouth, Devon. This passion for acoustic music was especially stirred by the Davey Graham album Folk Blues and Beyond. He played his first gig when he was fourteen in a band called Retrospect with Richard Entwistle, John Allman and Martin Pike and other musicians, and by the time he was sixteen he was performing regularly. Beer worked with Paul Downes as a duo from 1974 and also in the Arizona Smoke Revue 1980. He was a key member of Johnny Coppin's band (ex-Decameron), and together they collaborated with Nigel Mazlyn Jones on his 1979 Sentinel album. He toured with Mike Oldfield in 1979 and also recorded some tracks at Oldfield's Througham studio.  Beer joined The Albion Band in 1984 and stayed with them until 1991, touring extensively at home and abroad, and recording many albums. Show of Hands became a full-time partnership from 1991. Beer continues to do session work, most notably on The Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels album, Steve Harley's Poetic Justice and countless other mainstream and less high-profile projects.  Recent projects include two albums for folk fiddle player Jackie Oates, two albums for former Spinners singer Mick Groves, an album for folk musician Jez Lowe, an album for singer-songwriter Tom Palmer and an album for north Devon singer Jenna.", "Beer and frequent collaborator Paul Downes recorded Life Ain't Worth Living in 1973, followed by Dance Without Music in 1976. Shortly before his work with Mike Oldfield for Exposed, Beer released his first solo album in 1978/1979, Mandoline. His next primary solo album didn't come until 1994, Hard Hats. In 1998, his album The Works was released, apparently recorded in 1989 during his time with The Rolling Stones. In 1999, Phil Beer started a project in bringing together the UK's finest folk musicians which resulted in the album The Fiddle Collection. With The Phil Beer Band, the very scarce albums Mandorock and Once in a Blue Moon were released in 2000 and 2001 respectively. On the supporting Mandorock tour, the only commonly available Phil Beer Band album, Mandorock 2000 Live was recorded but not released until 2009. As Hard Hats and The Works were out of print by the 21st century, they were re-released together as Hard Works in 2000. In 2001, he and other former members of The Albion Band released an album called Ridgeriders, which was the soundtrack to a show about South Country tracks airing at the same time. They also toured for the album and this ended in the live album \"Ridgeriders\" In Concert. He and Deb Sandland also released a live album, Beer and Sandland Live 2003, in 2004.
