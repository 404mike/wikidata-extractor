He had been teaching judo and playing organ for a church near his home town. His arrival has been heralded as the most significant event in the band's formation. Walsh also took up the guitar, following frustration over not finding a musician right for the group.

He booked the band for two shows in London in April 2000, which saw a writing from the NME in attendance.
