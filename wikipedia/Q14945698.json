He was educated at Keble College, Oxford, and ordained in  1922. His first post was as a curate in Harrow but his next post was in South Africa (where he was to spend the rest of his career). After a further curacy at St Paul's church in Rondebosch he rose rapidly in the Church hierarchy becoming successively rector of Okiep, Northern Cape; Stellenbosch and finally the cathedral parish at Bloemfontein before his elevation to the episcopate.
