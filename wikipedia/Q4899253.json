She grew up in the Peak District and attended Repton School. This country setting and her family gave her the inspiration for her debut album, Mabel and I. The album is a mixture of folksy ballads, jazz and country.\n\nShe is from Manchester, England. Her career has spanned 15 years and has taken her from the United Kingdom to the United States, Brazil and Japan. In her early years Beulah worked Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy. At the age of 22 she moved to London and met Jon Kelly, and they, along with Universal Records, made her debut album Mabel & I. However, she spent most of her career in the United States, namely Nashville and Los Angeles, working alongside Grammy Award-winning writer/producer David Foster and songwriter Sarah Siskind. She was also sang with Andrea Bocelli.\nShe has written with many other writers such as Crispin Hunt, Steve Booker and Amy Foster. She is currently working alongside BAFTA- and Oscar-winning executive producer, Maggie Monteith, among others, as she enjoys her move into film and television.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stay", "response": ["* \"Stay\", by Beulah"]}, {"page": "Lazy Day", "response": ["*\"Lazy Days\", song by Beulah (singer)"]}, {"page": "Over the Rainbow \u2013 The Songbird Collection", "response": ["# \"Stay\" \u2013 Beulah"]}, {"page": "Mabel and I", "response": ["#REDIRECT Beulah (singer)#Discography"]}, {"page": "Stay (Beulah song)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Beulah (singer)"]}, {"page": "List of Beulah songs", "response": ["#REDIRECT Beulah (singer)#Discography"]}, {"page": "Beulah", "response": ["Beulah is a term from the Biblical Hebrew to refer to the Lord's country, Beulah (land).
