Waddington paired the group with manager John Morris, the husband of singer Clodagh Rodgers and under his guidance, the band duly emerged at the tail end of the glam rock movement, wearing trademark white suits and cloth caps on stage. Their first release, \"Sugar Baby Love\" was an instant hit remaining at number one in the United Kingdom for four weeks in May 1974, while reaching number 37 on the US chart that August, and remains their best-known record. Subsequent releases were to be less successful, but the band continued to tour well into the 2000s with two line-ups in existence."]}, {"page": "Stormy Weather (song)", "response": ["In September 1933, the group Comedian Harmonists released their German cover version, titled \"Ohne Dich\" (\"Without You\") with lyrics that are quite different.

Leo Reisman's orchestra version had the biggest hit on records (with Arlen himself as vocalist), although Ethel Waters' recorded version also sold well.  \"Stormy Weather\" was performed by Horne in the 1943 film Stormy Weather, a big, all-star show for World War II soldiers."]}, {"page": "1947 in music", "response": ["*March 5 \u2013 Clodagh Rodgers, singer"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1971", "response": ["The BBC were worried about the possible audience reaction to the UK song due to the hostilities raging in Northern Ireland.

Rodgers performed the songs weekly, before showcasing all six in the Song for Europe edition of the Cliff Richard Show, where they were also immediately repeated. Due to a postal strike, viewers were unable to cast votes for the songs this year, so 8 regional juries, consisting of 10 jurors with just one vote each for their favourite song, were constructed from members of the public. These juries were located in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, London, Manchester & Norwich. \"Jack in the Box\" was chosen as the winning song, with two songs tying for second place. Rodgers released two standard 7-inch singles of the winner, with one of the runners-up \"Someone to Love Me\" or \"Wind of Change\" on the B-Sides. She also released a three-track maxi single which included both the second placed songs. The combined sales of the three singles (which all shared the catalogue number RCA2066) reached No.4 in the UK singles chart; Rodgers last top 10 single in the UK. Later in the year, she released a fourth song from the final \"Look Left, Look Right\", together with the three already released tracks on the LP Rodgers and Heart. \"Another Time, Another Place\" was then included on the 1972 budget LP Clodagh Rodgers, after it had become a No.13 hit single for Engelbert Humperdinck. To date, only the last place song \"In My World of Beautiful Things\" has never been officially released in any form."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982", "response": ["Paul Curtis planned to perform two of his three entries himself and recorded the two tracks for his forthcoming album. \"Different Worlds, Different People\" was to be performed by Curtis with a backing trio, but he opted not to sing the song himself due to the running order, and Bobby McVay sang the song in the competition with Samantha Spencer Lane and two other singers under the group name Lovin' Feeling. McVay returned to win the contest the following year as a member of Sweet Dreams. Curtis returned on several more occasions as a songwriter, winning the contest in 1984, 1990 and 1991. Curtis' third song was performed by family group The Weltons, who were the only act taking part in the 1982 final that had any prior performing or recording experience, having released several singles, including \"Down at Shorty's Place\", \"Hang 10, Hang10\", and \"Sweet Rock 'n' Roller\", although none of them had reached the UK singles chart, but they had been promoted on German television and radio.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  The quartet 'Good Looks' featured Lewis and Lavinia Rodgers, the brother and sister of former UK Eurovision entrant Clodagh Rodgers. Although formed for the competition to sing Dave Mindel's \"Every Day of My Life\", the group stayed together and recorded the closing theme song for Jim'll Fix It, also composed by Mindel. On one edition of that show, the group performed the song with a viewer who'd asked Jim to fix it for him to sing the song."]}]}}
