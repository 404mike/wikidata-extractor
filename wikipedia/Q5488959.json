He joined the club in 1915 and, 19 years later played his last game for them in 1934, against West Ham United. By this time, he had played 460 times for the club, at the time a club record, which since then has only been surpassed by three players.\nPenn was an outside left noted for his speed and crossing ability. He also contributed a number of goals to the club. After his retirement, he lent his physiotherapy skills to the club (he qualified as a physio while still playing), and worked for the club for a further 26 years, from 1939 to 1965. He was unlucky to never win a full England cap, having been picked for various wartime representative teams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank Penn", "response": ["Frank Penn may refer to:", "*Frank Penn (cricketer, born 1851) (1851\u20131916), English cricketer", "*Frank Penn (cricketer, born 1884) (1884\u20131961), English cricketer", "*Frank Penn (footballer), English footballer, fl. 1910\u20131940"]}, {"page": "List of Fulham F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Frank Penn \u2013 459", "* Frank Penn"]}, {"page": "Frank Osborne (footballer)", "response": ["At Fulham, playing alongside Andy Ducat and Frank Penn, he was top scorer in 1922\u201323 accounting for 10 of the team's 43 league goals, in what was generally a low-scoring season in Division Two. His goal-scoring exploits in a weak Fulham side brought him to the notice of the England selectors who picked him for the matches against Northern Ireland on 21 October 1922 (won 2\u20130) and France on 10 May 1923 (won 4\u20131), although he failed to score in either match. He thus became the first Fulham player to be capped by England.", "His was a unique career, matched only in its longevity by his former playing colleague and subsequently trainer, Frank Penn.

At Fulham early in the season, Dickson reportedly found home forward Frank Penn \"so clever that [he] seemed to give him up as a job too bad to be undertaken\", but later that month, he was the pick of Darlington's side and scored twice in a 4\u20132 defeat of Reading. He was injured in the fourth-round defeat to First Division Cardiff City in that season's FA Cup, initially moving out to the wing before having to leave the field entirely for half an hour. Darlington were relegated back to the Northern Section on the final day of the season."]}]}}
