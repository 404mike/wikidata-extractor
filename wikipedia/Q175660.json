Despite playing most of his career in the top level of English football, Chettle never made the England squad, but came close in 1992, despite this Chettle played 12 games for the England Under-21s, captaining them in his final appearance. He went on to play for Barnsley, Walsall and Grimsby Town before ending his career in Non-League football with stints at Burton Albion and Ilkeston Town.\nSince his retirement, Chettle had coached at former club Forest at academy level, before joining Ilkeston in 2014. He went on to join Notts County as a first team coach and twice served as caretaker manager during the 2018\u201319 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Steve Chettle /Mark Crossley (Caretakers)", "|align=left|Steve Chettle (Caretaker)"]}, {"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["* Steve Chettle"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Steve Chettle"]}, {"page": "Frank Clark (footballer)", "response": ["Clough's 18-year reign as Forest manager had ended in relegation from the new FA Premier League in 1993, having brought a league title, two European Cups, four League Cups and several top five finishes, and Clark had to deal with the sale of two of Forest's key players - Roy Keane and Nigel Clough - for a combined total of more than \u00a36million soon after his return to the City Ground. However, he was able to hold onto the likes of Stuart Pearce, Steve Chettle, Steve Stone and Ian Woan, and took Forest back into the Premier League at the first time of asking, as they finished runners-up in Division One."]}, {"page": "Bulwell", "response": ["*Steve Chettle (born 1968), former football player for Nottingham Forest, educated at Alderman Derbyshire School (which was on the site of what is now Bulwell Academy)"]}, {"page": "Riccardo Scimeca", "response": ["He spent four seasons at the City Ground, and took over as captain when Steve Chettle left in his first season. However Chris Bart-Williams was appointed captain the following season. Scimeca was consistent and reliable in his spell at Forest, playing in various positions. He featured regularly in central defence and midfield, but also had spells at right back and right-midfield. He scored 4 goals in his second season. In the 2001\u201302 season he formed a solid defensive partnership with Jon Olav Hjelde. In 2002\u201303, his last season, in which Forest made the play-offs, Paul Hart deployed him in a defensive midfield role within a diamond 4\u20134\u20132 formation. He scored 4 goals during this season, and played a prominent role throughout his four years at the club."]}, {"page": "Georges Santos", "response": ["After remaining without a club until December 2002, Santos joined Grimsby Town, signing a deal until the end of the season. He notably scored his only goal for Grimsby in a 2\u20130 victory over local rivals and fellow relegation strugglers Sheffield Wednesday, towering above his marker to power home a header from the centre of the penalty area following a Stuart Campbell corner. Santos became a popular figure amongst the club's supporters and he was singled out for a lot of praise despite the club's overall poor form during the season. Initially signed as a midfielder, Santos had been drafted in as a makeshift centre half when Steve Chettle was ruled out for a lengthy period. He was usually paired with Jamaican youngster Simon Ford or player/manager Paul Groves who incidentally this season had adopted playing at centre half in opposed to his regular central midfield sitting. Despite the best efforts of Santos he was unable to help save the Mariners from relegation from the First Division, but went on to be awarded with the Player of the Season award for his stone wall like performances at the back. Despite winning this award and putting himself in the running for club captain for the 2003\u20132004 campaign, Santos rejected a new contract in order to stay in the First Division."]}, {"page": "Simon Ford", "response": ["During the 2002\u201303 season Ford was favoured by new manager Paul Groves and took his chance in the first team when injury had sidelined new signing Steve Chettle earlier that season. Ford, who regularly partnered Georges Santos at the back, would go on to make 40 appearances that season. Despite Ford's surge into the first team the club were relegated but his consistent performances had drawn some interest from fellow Division One sides Bradford City and Wolverhampton Wanderers. But no transfer ever materialised. During the 2003\u201304 season Ford fell out of contention within the club to the preferred pairing of Tony Crane and Mike Edwards."]}, {"page": "Darren Barnard", "response": ["Barnard joined Grimsby Town for the start of the 2002\u201303 season along with fellow Barnsley player Steve Chettle. Barnard was used as a left sided midfielder in his first season while under manager Paul Groves, but was also used at left back, the latter was primarily his main position after the departure of Tony Gallimore in the summer of 2003. In both Barnard's seasons at Blundell Park he suffered relegations in which Grimsby went from Division One to Division Three. Following the club's financial difficulties many of Barnard's colleagues had been inexperienced youngsters. Despite not having any luck at his club, Barnard collected another 6 Welsh caps, the last as a substitute against Norway on 27 May 2004, coincidentally alongside former Grimsby teammates Danny Coyne and John Oster."]}, {"page": "1991 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|CB ||5 || Steve Chettle"]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Steve Chettle||||CB||2002\u20132003||20||1"]}]}}
