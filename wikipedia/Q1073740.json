William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, a recent graduate of Edinburgh Medical School, proposed in an article to medical journal The Lancet to inject people infected with cholera with highly oxygenated salts to treat the \"universal stagnation of the venous system and rapid cessation of arterialisation of the blood\" seen in people with severely dehydrated cholera. He found his treatment harmless in dogs, and his proposal was soon adopted by the physician Thomas Latta in treating people with cholera to beneficial effect. In the following decades, variations and alternatives to Latta's solution were tested and used in treating people with cholera. These solutions contained a range of concentrations of sodium, chloride, potassium, carbonate, phosphate, and hydroxide. The breakthrough in achieving physiological concentrations was accomplished by Sydney Ringer in the early 1880s,Kenneth M Sutin; Marino, Paul L. (2007). \"The ICU book\" . Hagerstown, Maryland: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. . when he determined the optimal salt concentrations to maintain the contractility of frog heart muscle tissue. Normal saline is considered a descendant of the pre-Ringer solutions, as Ringer's findings were not adopted and widely used until decades later. The term \"normal saline\" itself appears to have little historical basis, except for studies done in 1882\u201383 by Dutch physiologist Hartog Jacob Hamburger; these in vitro studies of red cell lysis suggested incorrectly that 0.9% was the concentration of salt in human blood (rather than 0.6%, the true concentration)."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Sydney Ringer (MB), British clinician, physiologist and pharmacologist, best known for inventing Ringer's solution"]}, {"page": "Ringer's lactate solution", "response": ["Ringer's saline solution was invented in the early 1880s by Sydney Ringer, a British physician and physiologist. Ringer was studying the beating of an isolated frog heart outside of the body.  He hoped to identify the substances in blood that would allow the isolated heart to beat normally for a time. The use of Ringer's original solution of inorganic salts slowly became more popular. In the 1930s, the original solution was further modified by American pediatrician Alexis Hartmann for the purpose of treating acidosis. Hartmann added lactate, which mitigates changes in pH by acting as a buffer for acid. Thus the solution became known as \"Ringer's lactate solution\" or \"Hartmann's solution\"."]}, {"page": "UCL Medical School", "response": ["* Sydney Ringer, a British clinician, physiologist and pharmacologist, best known for inventing Ringer's solution."]}, {"page": "Cardioplegia", "response": ["The word cardioplegia combines the Greek cardio meaning the \"heart\", and plegia \"paralysis\". Technically, this means arresting or stopping the heart so that surgical procedures can be done in a still and bloodless field. Most commonly, however, the word cardioplegia refers to the solution used to bring about asystole of the heart, or heart paralysis. One of the first physicians to use the term cardioplegia was Dr. Lam in 1957. However his work on the myocardial protection was preceded serendipitously by Sydney Ringer in the late 1800s. At that time Ringer and colleagues noticed that tap water had the ability to increase contractility of the heart, likely due its high calcium content. Sydney Ringer also commented on the importance of potassium ion concentration on depressing intrinsic heart rhythm. Through a series of experiments performed on frog and canine hearts, reversible arrest was achieved with potassium ions with the consequence of ventricular fibrillation and observed myocardial necrosis. These early experiments started nearly 50 years of work that has led to variety of perfusion strategies available today."]}, {"page": "Lastingham", "response": ["* Sydney Ringer, physician and originator of Ringer's Solution"]}, {"page": "Frederick Ringer", "response": ["Frederick Ringer was born 1838 in Norwich but spent most of his life in Japan.Harold S.
