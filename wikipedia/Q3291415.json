This conclusion was criticised by M.P. Pickering, who instead suggested that the evidence was better explained by defleshing rituals involved in secondary burial, drawing ethnographic comparisons with certain Indigenous Australian practices.Pickering 1989. Pickering's views were supported by the archaeologist Paul Bahn,Bahn 1990. but in turn came under counter-criticisms from Villa.Villa 1992.", "The case for cannibalism was disputed by the archaeologist Michael P. Pickering in a 1989 paper published in Australian Archaeology. He considered it \"more likely\" that the remains were the result of a mortuary rite in which the corpses were left to decompose before being de-fleshed and then buried. He highlighted ethnographic parallels with the mortuary practices of some Indigenous Australian societies, although stressed that he was not arguing for direct analogy between the Indigenous Australians of the 20th century and the people of Neolithic France. Discussing the ethnographic accounts of W.E. Roth undertaken in North Queensland during the early 20th century in which corpses were left in trees or on platforms to decompose before burial, he also highlights those produced by A. McDonald in the 1870s in which Indigenous communities were recorded de-fleshing the bones prior to burial. Pickering argues that this method would leave very similar traces on the remains to those uncovered at Fontbr\u00e9goua. Although he does not rule out cannibalism as a possibility at the site, he did maintain that it was only one possibility, with de-fleshed secondary burials being another. Pickering was supported in his hypothesis by the European prehistorian Paul Bahn, who published a short one-page article in the journal Nature in 1990, in which he proclaimed that the case for cannibalism at Fontbr\u00e9goua must be considered \"not proven.\""]}, {"page": "Inside the Neolithic Mind", "response": ["Susan A.

Ultimately acknowledging that the analysis on offer do not require the neurological backing that the authors provide, Johnston suggested that the contemporary preoccupation with rooting archaeological interpretations in \"biological reality\" was a part of the \"21st-century mind\".Johnston 2006."]}, {"page": "2014 in archaeology", "response": ["* Paul Bahn (ed.) - The History of Archaeology: an introduction."]}, {"page": "Peter Samuel Cook", "response": ["Cook\u2019s exploits were also the basis of John Burnside\u2019s 2001 novel The Locust Room, and have featured in Paul Bahn\u2019s memoir The Cambridge Rapist - Unmasking The Beast of Bedsitland.
