He worked as a civil engineer after graduating until 1891 when he became an electrical engineer.  He migrated to Tasmania in 1895.\nIn Australia his interest in electrical engineering took off.  He designed the Duck Reach Power Station and made early surveys for the Great Lakes schemes.  In 1907 he was made Chief Electrical Engineer to the New South Wales Department of Public Works.  He was in charge of the generation of thermal electricity.  In 1915 he commenced writing a series of reports on a Snowy River scheme. In 1920 Corin estimated the cost of the Snowy River scheme at \u00a32 million and that it would produce 1,500GwH of power. He worked for both the British and French Governments on projects in Fiji and New Caledonia. Finding working in the Government uncongenial he resigned in 1923 to undertake private consulting.\nHe died of cancer in Sydney in 1929 and is buried in the Northern Suburbs cemetery.\nCorin Dam in the Australian Capital Territory is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of electrical engineers", "response": ["|William Corin"]}, {"page": "Mullumbimby", "response": ["A static inverter plant of HVDC Directlink is located at Laverty's Gap near Mullumbimby. This inverter plant was previously the site of a 288\u00a0kW hydroelectric power scheme that powered Mullumbimby, Byron Bay and Bangalow from 1926, using water from a weir in nearby Wilsons Creek. The scheme was the fourth hydro electric power station in NSW and only the fifth on mainland Australia. Powering Mullumbimby for the first time in 1925, the scheme made Mullumbimby one of the first country towns in NSW to receive electricity. Although decommissioned in 1990, it is now of state heritage significance. The hydroelectric scheme was designed by William Corin (1867\u20131929). The site is being considered for pumped-storage hydroelectricity."]}, {"page": "WS Corin", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Corin"]}, {"page": "Corin", "response": ["*William Corin (1867\u20131929), Australian electrical engineer"]}, {"page": "Corin Dam", "response": ["The Corin Dam is an earth and rockfill embankment dam with an uncontrolled side channel spillway across the Cotter River, located within Namadgi National Park in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.
