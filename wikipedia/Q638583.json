The trio was named after Smith's daughter, Corrie Smith, but because a corrie is a deep bowl in a mountain, the name was particularly appropriate as it evokes imagery of the Scottish landscape. After Turner dropped out in 1962, Roy Williamson teamed up with Smith and Cruikshank to form the Corrie Folk Trio. Their first performance was in the Waverley Bar in St Mary's Street, Edinburgh. After a few weeks, Cruikshank left due to illness. They had already accepted an engagement at the Edinburgh Festival so Williamson suggested that Ronnie Browne should be brought in to make up the numbers.", "Roy Williamson suffered from asthma and before a series of concerts he would deliberately cease treatment to provoke attacks and gain temporary immunity. During the Corries' 1989 tour, Williamson's health went into decline and he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He spent his last years living in Forres, close to where he spent his school years. He died on 12 August 1990."]}, {"page": "Scottish music (1900\u20131949)", "response": ["* Roy Williamson (1936\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Scottish music (1990\u20131999)", "response": ["*Roy Williamson (1936\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh College of Art", "response": ["* Roy Williamson, member of The Corries, and author of Flower of Scotland"]}, {"page": "Ronnie Browne", "response": ["Browne was born in Edinburgh to John Albert 'Bertie' Browne, a truck driver, and Anne 'Nancy' Browne.
