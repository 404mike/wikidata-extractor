It is thought that she learned Greek, Latin, and French under his tutelage. Her father was also a Latin, Greek and Hebrew tutor to John Ruskin, who Emily and Eliza were later credited with introducing to the Pre Raphaelites Brotherhood. As a child, Emily's portrait was drawn by George Lance around 1834. Now known as Emily Augusta Patmore at 10 years of age, the drawing is in the collection of the British Museum, but not currently on display. It shows her head and shoulders, looking slightly up and smiling."]}]}}
