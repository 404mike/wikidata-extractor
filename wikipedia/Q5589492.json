He has also contributed to the theoretical understanding of the role of functional morphology in evolution. Together with S\u00f6ren Jensen he reintroduced the concepts of stem and crown groups to phylogenetics. \nHe has edited  Acta Zoologica together with Lennart Olsson; he has also edited the Geological Magazine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lobopodia", "response": ["Based on their apparently onychophoran-like morphology (e.g. annulated cuticle, lobopodous appendage with claws), lobopodians were traditionally thought to be present a group of paleozoic onychophorans. This interpretation was flawed after the discovery of lobopodians with arthropod and tardigrade-like characters, suggest the similarity between lobopodians and onychophorans represent deeper panarthropod ancestral trait (plesiomorphies) instead of onychophoran-exclusive characters (synapomorphies). For example, The British palaeontologist Graham Budd sees the Lobopodia as representing a basal grade from which the phyla Onychophora and Arthropoda arose, with Aysheaia comparable to the ancestral plan, and with forms like Kerygmachela and Pambdelurion representing a transition that, via dinocaridids to arthropods, would lead to an arthropod body plan. Aysheaia's surface ornamentation, if homologous with palaeoscolecid sclerites, may represent a deeper link connecting it with cycloneuralian outgroups. Many further studies follow and extend the idea, generally agreed that all three panarthropod phyla have lobopodians in their stem lineages. Lobopodians are thus paraphyletic, and include the last common ancestor of arthropods, onychophorans and tardigrades."]}, {"page": "Opabinia", "response": ["In 1996, Graham Budd found what he considered evidence of short, un-jointed legs in Opabinia. His examination of the gilled lobopodian Kerygmachela from the Sirius Passet lagerst\u00e4tte, about  and over 10M\u00a0years older than the Burgess Shale, convinced him that this specimen had similar legs. He considered the legs of these two genera very similar to those of the Burgess Shale lobopodian Aysheaia and the modern onychophorans (velvet worms), which are regarded as the bearers of numerous ansectral traits shared by the ancestors with arthropods. After examining several sets of features shared by these and similar lobopodianm he drew up a \"broad-scale reconstruction of the arthropod stem-group\", in other words of arthropods and what he considered to be their evolutionary basal members. One striking feature of this family tree is that modern tardigrades (water bears) may be Opabinias closest living evolutionary relatives. On the other hand, Hou et al. (1995, 2006) rather suggested Opabinia is a member of unusual cycloneuralian worms with convergent arthropod features."]}, {"page": "Crown group", "response": ["and the \"crown\" and \"stem\" group terminology was coined by R. P. S. Jefferies in 1979. Though formulated in the 1970s, the term was not commonly used until its reintroduction in 2000 by Graham Budd and S\u00f6ren Jensen."]}, {"page": "Arthropod head problem", "response": ["Many Cambrian arthropods, including the trilobites themselves, possess a single pair of slender antennae, which have been equated with either the first or second antennae of the crustaceans; and either the chelicerae or the missing appendages of the supposedly reduced deuterocerebrum in chelicerates. However, another group of arthropods, the so-called \"great appendage\" arthropods, including Yohoia, Leanchoilia and Alalcomenaeus, do not possess simple antennae, but rather have a robust, branched structure, which was called the \"great appendage\" by Harry B. Whittington in his restudy of these taxa. Yet another group of arthropods may possess two differentiated head appendages, of which the most important and controversial is the Chengjiang form Fuxianhuia. Fuxianhuia was claimed to possess a pair of short antennae anterior, followed by a robust pair of \"sub-chelate\" appendages. However, this assessment has been both disputed by Waloszek and colleagues, who consider that the sub-chelate appendages are in fact gut diverticulae; and supported by Graham Budd. Thus, its nature remains controversial at present. Other taxa have also been claimed to have a somewhat similar anterior appendage arrangement (e.g. Fortiforceps) but, with the exception of the well-preserved Branchiocaris from the Burgess Shale, most of them are highly equivocal.", "Graham Budd's theory agrees with that of Scholtz and Edgecombe in accepting the protocerebral nature of the onychophoran antennae, and the two preoral appendages of Fuxianhuia. However, he traces the origin of the \"great appendages\" in the differentiated frontal appendages of Cambrian lobopods such as Aysheaia and Kerygmachela, neither of which possess convincing antennae. Thus, in Budd's view, the order of the two anterior appendages of taxa such as Fuxianhuia are reversed: the antennae are the first antennae (deutocerebral) of the mandibulates; and the great appendages correspond to the primary antennae of the onychophorans and Cambrian lobopods. Following previous work by Dewel and colleagues, Budd accounts for their reversal by arguing that the mouth in basal lobopods was terminal, and that as it rotated backwards and downwards, it brought the anterior appendage backwards with it. Given this transformation, it is likely, under this theory, that the remnant of the great appendage/primary antenna is the labrum of extant arthropods. Because in this view Fuxianhuia possesses both a hypostome and a great appendage, the hypostome cannot be straightforwardly homologous with the labrum."]}, {"page": "Palaeontological Association", "response": ["| Graham Budd and Matthew Wills"]}, {"page": "Lennart Olsson", "response": ["Olsson edits the journal Acta Zoologica together with Graham Budd.Wiley-Blackwell: Acta Zoologica, accessed 2010-05-13"]}, {"page": "Phylum", "response": ["A definition of a phylum based on body plan has been proposed by paleontologists Graham Budd and S\u00f6ren Jensen (as Haeckel had done a century earlier). The definition was posited because extinct organisms are hardest to classify: they can be offshoots that diverged from a phylum's line before the characters that define the modern phylum were all acquired. By Budd and Jensen's definition, a phylum is defined by a set of characters shared by all its living representatives."]}, {"page": "Cambrian explosion", "response": ["Graham Budd synthesises various schemes to produce a compatible view of the SSF record of the Cambrian explosion, divided slightly differently into four intervals: a \"Tube world\", lasting from , spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, dominated by Cloudina, Namacalathus and pseudoconodont-type elements; a \"Sclerite world\", seeing the rise of halkieriids, tommotiids, and hyoliths, lasting to the end of the Fortunian (c. 525 Ma); a brachiopod world, perhaps corresponding to the as yet unratified Cambrian Stage 2; and Trilobite World, kicking off in Stage 3."]}, {"page": "Arthropod", "response": ["Further analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are monophyletic, in other words they are inferred to share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod. The book is  For example, Graham Budd's analyses of Kerygmachela in 1993 and of Opabinia in 1996 convinced him that these animals were similar to onychophorans and to various Early Cambrian \"lobopods\", and he presented an \"evolutionary family tree\" that showed these as \"aunts\" and \"cousins\" of all arthropods. These changes made the scope of the term \"arthropod\" unclear, and Claus Nielsen proposed that the wider group should be labelled \"Panarthropoda\" (\"all the arthropods\") while the animals with jointed limbs and hardened cuticles should be called \"Euarthropoda\" (\"true arthropods\")."]}, {"page": "Tactopoda", "response": ["Anatomic arguments for the tactopoda monophyly include similarities in the anatomies of head, legs, and muscles between the arthropods and the tardigrades. Anatomic arguments against it include that tardigrades lack the kind of circulatory system (including a dorsal heart) which the arthropods and the velvet worms share. Graham Budd argued that the lack of this system in recent tardigrades is due to their miniature size, which makes a complex circulatory system superfluous; thus, the loss of this feature would be a secondary property, acquired as the tardigrade stem group turned smaller, and both the Euarthropoda+Onychophora circulatory system and a relatively large size should be a feature of the last common ancestor of all three groups. However, Gregory Edgecombe also invoked phylogenomic evidence in favour of the alternative Euarthropoda+Onychophora grouping."]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* Graham Budd (England, 1968- )"]}, {"page": "Choanozoa", "response": ["Choanozoa is a clade of opisthokont eukaryotes consisting of the choanoflagellates (Choanoflagellatea) and the animals (Animalia, Metazoa).
