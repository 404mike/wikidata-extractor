The child next to Dury on the cover photograph is his son Baxter Dury. Ian Dury said Baxter ran into shot just as the photograph was taken, but in adulthood Baxter said the photograph appears too posed to be impromptu. Gabrin said, \"I only shot 24 exposures and Baxter was in just four of them. As soon as the films were developed Ian came round and we immediately chose the same shot. We were so excited by the picture that we went straight into my darkroom and made the first print.
