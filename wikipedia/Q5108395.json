He previously played for First Liverpool, a minor league club based in east Belfast. He is a Glentoran supporter, growing up close to the club's home, The Oval. A fan's favourite, Walker has the club badge tattooed on his thigh.\nIn 2006 Walker had a testimonial match against The New Saints F.C., (previously known as TNS) which Glentoran lost 2-1. Former Glens player Jim Cleary featured in the match. Cleary's reason for playing was that if he played he would not be overtaken by Walker on attendances before his 50th birthday.\nOn 12 January 2007 he left Glentoran to join Armagh City, after a loan spell at the club.In August 2008 Chris Walker signed for Amateur league side Sirocco Works who play their football in Division 1A where he became player manager. However Walker would later return to the Oval to take charge of Glentoran's Under-17 side.Walker's son November 2008 to Jaxon Roy Kelly, born in November 2008, died of meningococcal disease on 24 March 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dundonald, County Down", "response": ["* Chris Walker, Glentoran footballer"]}, {"page": "Chris Walker", "response": ["Chris Walker may refer to:", "*Chris Walker (actor) (born 1964), British actor", "*Chris Walker (basketball, born 1969), American basketball coach", "*Chris Walker (basketball, born 1994), American basketball player", "*Chris Walker (cyclist) (born 1965), British former racing cyclist", "*Chris Walker (footballer) (born 1973), Northern Irish footballer", "*Chris Walker (motorcyclist) (born 1972), English motorcycle racer", "*Chris Walker (musician), American R&B singer", "*Chris Walker (rugby league) (born 1980), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Chris Walker (squash player) (born 1967), English squash player", "*Chris Walker (wrestler), professional wrestler", "*Chris Walker, antagonist of the horror game Outlast"]}, {"page": "1973 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*12 November \u2013 Chris Walker, footballer."]}, {"page": "2006 Setanta Sports Cup", "response": ["*  Chris Walker (Glentoran)"]}, {"page": "1999 Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks season", "response": ["The season kicked off on 7 March with an impressive 44-0 victory over the Balmain Tigers at Shark Park with two tries from Sean Ryan as well as tries to David Peachey, Mat Rogers, Brett Howland, Chris McKenna, Andrew Ettingshausen and debutant Jason Ferris. The result equaled the second biggest win in the club's history. However, more importantly for Cronulla, the match marked the return of captain Andrew Ettingshausen from a career threatening neck injury which had seen him sidelined for approximately eight months. The victory put the club in first place after the first round, due to their superior points difference. In round 2 Cronulla won 14-6 against defending premiers, the Brisbane Broncos, at ANZ Stadium with tries to David Peachey and Paul Donaghy. It was the lowest ever score by Brisbane at ANZ Stadium since they had begun playing their home matches at the venue in 1993. The following round, Cronulla saw off South Sydney 28-12 with two tries each to Brett Howland and Mat Rogers and tries for Jason Ferris and Jason Stevens. Cronulla came up against Brisbane for the second time in a fortnight and again defeated the defending premiers with a narrow 20-18 win at Shark Park. Tries to David Peachey, Brett Howland and Nathan Long helped secure the victory for Cronulla which kept them equal first on the ladder. However, Cronulla were lucky to come away with the two points as referee Paul Simpkins denied Chris Walker a penalty try just two minutes from full-time and then fullback Darren Lockyer missed a last minute sideline conversion which would have leveled the scores."]}]}}
