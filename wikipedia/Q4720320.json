The CD was released, under the Naxos label, in October 2012. In the liner notes accompanying the CD, Michael Haas - director of Research at the Jewish Music institute's \u2018International Centre of Suppressed Music\u2019 at Royal Holloway, University of London, and a leading expert on Central European composers whose careers were effectively destroyed by the Nazi accession to power, describes Waghalter as \"one of the most unjustly forgotten musicians of pre-1933 Europe,\" whose remarkable work compels the listener to wonder \"how was it possible that this music went missing for a century?\" The December 2012 issue of Pizzicato Magazine awarded the Naxos release a coveted Supersonic designation. In his review, editor-in-chief Remy Franck wrote: \"What a discovery: The Violin Concerto of composer Ignatz Waghalter was, with its romantic characteristics, somewhat 'out of fashion' at the time of its composition in 1911 \u2013 but the wealth of ideas in this composition is fascinating. And that goes as well for the other works in this CD.\"http://www.naxos.com/SharedFiles/Reviews/8.572809_Pizzicato_122012_gr.pdf"]}, {"page": "Elgar Society", "response": ["| Alexander Walker"]}, {"page": "Alexander Walker", "response": ["* Alexander Walker (cricketer) (1842-1903), Scottish cricketer", "* Alexander Walker (physiologist) (1779\u20131852), Scottish physiologist", "* Alexander Walker (1837\u20131889), British businessman", "* Alexander Walker II (1869\u20131950), British businessman", "* Alexander Walker (critic) (1930\u20132003), film critic", "* Alexander Walker (conductor) (born 1973), British conductor", "* Alexander Walker (MP) for Lichfield", "*Alexander Walker Scott (1800\u20131883), Australian entomologist", "*Alexander Walker Ogilvie (1829\u20131902), Canadian politician"]}, {"page": "Alexander Walker (Conductor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Walker (conductor) "]}]}}
