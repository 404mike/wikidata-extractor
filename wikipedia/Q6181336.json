Previous to this, he was a senior lecturer in the Department of Biology at University College London between 1995 and 2007.\nPast career includes a post-doctorate at Imperial College, and work at the Rice University, Texas. He completed his BA and PhD at Cambridge University, between 1982 and 1987.His research group specialises in the behavioural and evolutionary ecology of social systems, using eusocial insects as models. \nThe team's current work involves large-scale, long-term projects, running over several years, modelling and micro-satellite based work to investigate gene-relatedness, and assign offspring to parents. \nThe organisms which his team works on most are wasp and bee species Halictus, the hover wasp, and Polistes, the paper wasp. Some papers have been published as a result of these studies, in Nature and Behavioral Ecology. He has also, more recently, been quoted and written about in short articles for the 'Metro' newspaper amongst others, after he named a species of hover wasp \"hairy-faced\".He is also an editor of the scientific journal 'Behavioral Ecology'.", "link_mentions": []}}
