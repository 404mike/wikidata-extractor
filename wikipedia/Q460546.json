These plays tackled issues such as urban poverty and slavery. Boucicault was also involved in getting the 1856 law on copyright passed through Congress. His last New York play was The Colleen Bawn (1860). In that year, Boucicault returned to London to stage The Colleen Bawn and the play ran for 247 performances at The Adelphi Theatre. He wrote several more successful plays, including The Shaughran (1875) and Robert Emmet (1884). These later plays helped perpetuate the stereotype of the drunken, hotheaded, garrulous Irishman that had been common on the British stage since the time of Shakespeare.

Inspired by the successful production of Banim's play Damon and Pythias (1821), Griffin moved to London in 1823; he was nineteen years of age. After an unsuccessful attempt at becoming a playwright, Griffin endured years of poverty in London, managing only to scrape by through writing reviews for periodicals and newspapers.  At the end of two years he obtained steady employment in the publishing house as reader and reviser of manuscripts, and in a short time became frequent contributor to some of the leading periodicals and magazines. Griffin's early Literary Gazette pieces vividly described the rural setting of his childhood; recounted Irish folklore; translated the Celtic Irish language for the English readers; and, as Robert Lee Wolff has observed, \"waxed richly sardonic about Irishmen who tried to be more English than the English.\" "]}, {"page": "Anna Maria Hall", "response": ["Hall's sketches of her native land bear a closer resemblance to the tales of Mary Russell Mitford than to the Irish stories of John Banim or Gerald Griffin.
