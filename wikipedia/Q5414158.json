She has been married four times to Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) whom she killed on New Year\u2019s Day 2004, David (Harry Towb), Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd). Her feuds include a long-standing conflict with stepmother Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement), Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman), Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace).

Upon her return, Janine is caught forging a wedding that ends with the her new husband abruptly dying of a fatal heart attack. She later accidentally kills local resident Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) in a hit-and-run car drive; conspires with Peggy's brother-in-law Archie (Larry Lamb) to defraud the Mitchell family from their ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; becomes a prime suspect in Archie's murder investigation before attempting to kill her third husband Ryan by poisoning him.

They trace Janine to a synagogue, where, just after Janine and David are married, Pat declares that Janine is 'about as Jewish as a bacon sandwich'. David has a heart attack and dies, and a now homeless Janine has no choice but to return to Walford. Soon, she makes various enemies, among them Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), whom Janine drugs and then restrains so she can gain a taped confession of his past misdemeanours, which she uses as blackmail to gain control of Walford's car lot. Pat and Jack usurp her, reclaiming the business. Whilst driving around the square, Janine accidentally knocks down Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), the long-lost daughter of Jack's girlfriend Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack); moments later, Danielle dies and Janine is left guilt-ridden.
