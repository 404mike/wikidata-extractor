For example, Nick Holtam, Bishop of Salisbury, endorsed same-sex marriage following its passage. In December 2015, Alan Wilson, area Bishop of Buckingham, announced his support for same-gender marriage within the church. In 2016, another priest, in the Diocese of Southwark, converted his civil partnership into marriage and \"has kept his position\". The Church Times also reported that St. Agnes in North Riddish held a \"service of blessing\" and \"ceremony of commitment\" for a priest who had resigned to marry his partner. The Diocese in Europe also reported the marriage of a same-gender couple that took place in a Lutheran church in Denmark calling a \"truly joyful occasion\". The Diocese of Chichester featured Gay Pride in Brighton and encouraged participation. Also, the Diocese of Lichfield launched a congregation especially to reach out to LGBTI people. Paul Bayes, Bishop of Liverpool, has called for the church to be more inclusive of same-gender relationships. In 2018, the Diocese of St\u00a0Edmundsbury and Ipswich appointed Joe Hawes, who is in a civil partnership, as Dean of St\u00a0Edmundsbury. Later, the Diocese of Lichfield communicated support for \"radical Christian inclusion\" and that churches should welcome and honour LGBTI people. Andrew Foreshew-Cain, who entered into a same-sex marriage, continued in his position at St. Mary's Church, Kilburn and St. James' Church West in North London, but was prohibited and \"blacklisted\" from any other diocesan positions within the Church of England; however, in 2018, and due to the unique status of Church of England university chaplaincies, Foreshew-Cain was appointed as the Chaplain for the University of Oxford's Lady Margaret Hall, the first priest in a same-sex marriage appointed to the chaplaincy."]}, {"page": "Richard Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth", "response": ["On 11 February 2017, Harries was one of fourteen retired bishops to sign an open letter to the then-serving bishops of the Church of England.
