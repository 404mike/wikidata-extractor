He had his first full rugby union international cap for Scotland against USA on 4 November 2000, at the age of 20. At this point he was the 4th youngest capped player in Scottish rugby union history. The rest of the international season was heavily disrupted due to the Foot and Mouth outbreak of 2001, but Steel played in the delayed 2001 Six Nations Championship match against Ireland at Murrayfield in September 2001, in which Scotland beat Ireland 32-10. He had a further 3 international rugby union caps against Australia, All Blacks and Tonga. After switching codes, he was also named Scotland Rugby League Player of the Year in 2005.\nSteel played a huge role in Hull Kingston Rovers' promotion (to Super League) season in 2006. Following the promotion, Steel made a big impact in the initial stages of their first Super League season but was unfortunate to suffer a badly broken leg after only a handful of games. He was ruled out for most of the year as a result.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2008 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["*  Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "Hull Kingston Rovers", "response": ["* Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "John Steel", "response": ["*Jon Steel (born 1980), Scottish rugby league player"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Warriors", "response": ["*  Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "Scotland national rugby league team", "response": ["| 2005 || Jon Steel || Hull Kingston Rovers"]}, {"page": "Championship Cup", "response": ["* 5 Jon Steel (Hull Kingston Rovers) vs London Skolars 2005"]}, {"page": "Jed-Forest RFC", "response": ["* Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "2007 Hull Kingston Rovers season", "response": ["|Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "Jon Steel (rugby league player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "2008 Rugby League World Cup squads", "response": ["|Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "2009 European Cup", "response": ["|Featherstone Rovers||Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "2009 Hull Kingston Rovers season", "response": ["| Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Steele (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jon Steel, rugby league player"]}, {"page": "2009 Featherstone Rovers season", "response": ["|Jon Steel", "!width=30%|Jon Steel"]}, {"page": "2010 European Cup", "response": ["|  Featherstone Rovers || Jon Steel", "SCOTLAND: 1 Lee Paterson, 2.
