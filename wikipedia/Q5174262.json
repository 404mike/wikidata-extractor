She admitted in 2008 to making up film reviews and having \"skived\" from screenings, and her ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, has admitted to attending screenings on her behalf.Cosmo Landesman \"The demon wife of Fleet Street\", The Sunday Times, 12 October 2008, extrcted from Landesman's book, Starstruck: Fame, Failure, My Family and Me. Retrieved 4 November 2008.", "In 2014, Burchill's crowdfunded book Unchosen: The Memoirs of a Philo-Semite was published. Tel Aviv-based writer Akin Ajayi in Haaretz thought \"the reactionary solipsism of Unchosen is far removed from the affectionate warmness that a love of the Jewish people can be\". Burchill's ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, considered it to be an \"exhilarating and exasperating mix of the utterly brilliant and the totally bonkers\". He observes that \"there are plenty of Jews Julie doesn't love\" including the \"millions of Jews around the world who have ever criticised Israel. Her love is blind, deaf and dumb to such an obvious contradiction\". Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman wrote: \"Burchill divides up the chosen people into Good Jews (hardliners, Israelites) and Bad Jews (liberal Jews) with the enthusiasm of an antisemite. Hilariously, she sets herself up as the Jewishness Police, railing against Jews who are not Jewish enough\". In his review in The Independent, Keith Kahn-Harris, described Unchosen as \"occasionally touching, sometimes bigoted and sporadically hilarious\" but that it \"often degenerates into EDL-style abuse that lacks any redeeming wit.\"", "Immediately after her relationship with Parsons, Burchill married Cosmo Landesman, the son of Fran and Jay Landesman, with whom she also had a son.Jay Landesman \"The designer rebel who slept in our spare room\", The Independent, 29 March 1993 The sons from her marriages with Parsons and Landesman lived with their fathers after the separations. After splitting from Landesman in 1992, she married for a third time in 2004, to Daniel Raven, around 13 years her junior, and the brother of her former lover Charlotte Raven. She wrote of the joys of having a \"toyboy\" in her Times column in 2010.  Fellow NME journalist/author Paul Wellings wrote about their friendship in his book I'm A Journalist...Get Me Out of Here. She has written about her lesbian relationships, and declared that \"I would never describe myself as 'heterosexual', 'straight' or anything else. Especially not 'bisexual' (it sounds like a sort of communal vehicle missing a mudguard). I like 'spontaneous' as a sexual description\". In 2009 she said that she was only attracted to girls in their 20s, and since she was now nearly 50, \"I really don't want to be an old perv. So best leave it\"."]}, {"page": "Deepak Chopra", "response": ["He is placed by David Gorski among the \"quacks\", \"cranks\" and \"purveyors of woo\", and described as \"arrogantly obstinate\". The New York Times in 2013 stated that Deepak Chopra is \"the controversial New Age guru and booster of alternative medicine\". Time magazine stated that he is \"the poet-prophet of alternative medicine.\" He has become one of the best-known and wealthiest figures in the holistic-health movement. The New York Times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims. In 1999, Time magazine included Chopra in its list of the 20th century's heroes and icons.For Time, Peter Rowe, \"Truly, madly, deeply Deepak Chopra,\" U-T San Diego, May 3, 2014, p. 1 ; for Clinton, Public Papers of the presidents of the United States: William J. Clinton, 2000\u20132001, January 1 to June 26, 2000, Government Printing Office, 2001, p. 508. Cosmo Landesman wrote in 2005 that Chopra was \"hardly a man now, more a lucrative new age brand the David Beckham of personal/spiritual growth\".  For Timothy Caulfield, Chopra is an example of someone using scientific language to promote treatments that are not grounded in science: \"[Chopra] legitimizes these ideas that have no scientific basis at all, and makes them sound scientific. He really is a fountain of meaningless jargon.\" A 2008 Time magazine article by Ptolemy Tompkins commented that Chopra was a \"magnet for criticism\" for most of his career, and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals. Opinions ranged from the \"dismissive\" to the \"outright damning\". Chopra's claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can, some have argued, lure sick people away from medical treatment. Tompkins however considered Chopra a \"beloved\" individual whose basic messages centered on \"love, health and happiness\" had made him rich because of their popular appeal. English professor George O'Har argues that Chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives, and places what he calls Chopra's \"sophistries\" alongside the emotivism of Oprah Winfrey. Paul Kurtz writes that Chopra's \"regnant spirituality\" is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science, while Wendy Kaminer equates Chopra's views with irrational belief systems such as New Thought, Christian Science, and Scientology.Paul Kurtz, Skepticism and Humanism: The New Paradigm, Transaction Publishers, 2001, p. 110; "]}, {"page": "Toby Young", "response": ["In 1991, Young co-founded and co-edited the Modern Review with Julie Burchill and her then husband Cosmo Landesman.

Phil Villarreal believed that there were \"too few laugh-worthy moments\" and that \"instead of stretching to new frontiers, the film rests on the familiar\". Sheila Johnston criticized the pacing of the film and its joke level saying that \"the overall momentum flags at times\" and that it was \"a salvo of comic squibs, some very funny, others limp\". David Edwards agreed with this, writing that although \"there's a great half-hour show rattling around...the rest is padding at its very dullest\", concluding that it \"isn't a terrible film, just a terribly disappointing one.\" Cosmo Landesman believed, \"the humour seem[ed] to have lost its satirical bite and wit\" and that \"much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer\". This assessment was shared by Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times, who felt that \"once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning, the trenchancy kind of creaks and falls off.\" She negatively compared it to South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999), a film similarly adapted from an animated television series, saying that, in terms of satire, it offers \"nothing we don't hear every night on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\" Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show's secondary characters, and found the film to be \"a disappointment\".

Cosmo Landesman of The Sunday Times said \"having a quirky auteur like Anderson make a children's film is a bit like David Byrne, of Talking Heads, recording an album of nursery rhymes produced by Brian Eno\"; according to Landesman, \"in style and sensibility, this is really a Wes Anderson film, with little Dahl. It's missing the darker elements that characterise Dahl's books. There you find the whiff of something nasty: child abuse, violence, misogyny. Gone, too, is any sense of danger. Even the farmers, who are made to look a touch evil, don't seem capable of it. We never feel the tension of watching the Fox family facing real peril. The film certainly has Americanized Dahl's story, and I don't mean the fact that the good animals have American accents and the baddies have British ones. It offers yet another celebration of difference and a lesson on the importance of being yourself.
