He played drums on early Cliff Richard and the Shadows hits and on early Shadows instrumentals.\nMeehan was professionally nicknamed \"The Baron\" by his many admirers and friends within the British pop-rock music industry. He is reckoned to have influenced many thousands of teenage boys and adolescents to take up music as a career, including Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac, as a result of his iconic film performance in Cliff Richard's film The Young Ones. \nHis drumming style (cf. \"Bongo Blues\", \"Apache\") is noticeably different from that of other drummers that the Shadows employed during 1958\u20132010 such as Brian Bennett, Clem Cattini and Trevor Spencer. In his contribution to the 1961 book The Shadows by Themselves, Meehan gives advice to all would-be drummers on drum-kit care and maintenance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Instrumental", "response": ["|Jet Harris and Tony Meehan"]}, {"page": "Keith Moon", "response": ["Moon took lessons from one of the loudest contemporary drummers, Screaming Lord Sutch's Carlo Little, at 10 shillings per lesson.

His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly Gene Krupa (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied). Moon also admired Elvis Presley's original drummer DJ Fontana, the Shadows' original drummer Tony Meehan and the Pretty Things' Viv Prince. He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in Motown. Moon idolised the Beach Boys; Roger Daltrey later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even at the peak of the Who's fame."]}, {"page": "1943", "response": ["** Tony Meehan, British drummer (The Shadows) (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "Mick Fleetwood", "response": ["Abandoning academic pursuits, Fleetwood took up the drums after his parents, recognizing that he might find a future in music, bought him a \"Gigster\" drum kit when he was thirteen.

His first years were heavily influenced by Tony Meehan and the Everly Brothers, and during his formative years in London during the late 1960s, Green helped Fleetwood through bouts of \"rhythmic dyslexia\" during live performances when Fleetwood panicked and lost the beat. He often sang filled pauses along to songs to help keep the beat.Caillat (2012) p.\u00a038\u201339. Green also instilled in Fleetwood an ability to follow and predict the lead guitarist, enabling him to meet the guitar with the drum rhythm as well as allowing him to know a good guitarist when he saw one \u2013 which would in part lead him later in his career to select Lindsey Buckingham.Carroll (2004) p. 17."]}, {"page": "Cliff Richard", "response": ["It was on \"Living Doll\" that the Drifters began to back Richard on record.
