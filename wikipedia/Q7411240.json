Davidson", "response": ["The final question which may be asked on this topic is whether Davidson ever accepted in full the tenets of the documentary theory of the origin of the Pentateuch. The answer to that question, in as far as it can be answered is that they did not. There are two reasons for this answer, the first of which is that he had studied as was noted earlier under Heinrich Ewald, who had revived Wellhausen's interest in the Hebrew language and history in his teaching, but Ewald never accepted the basis of the documentary hypothesis. The second reason has been reported by Professor Andrew Harper who stated that, \"Consequently, though he recognised the greatness of scholars like Wellhausen, he was never affected by the Wellhausen or other orthodoxies which soon grew up in the critical schools\".J. Strahan, 'Andrew Bruce Davidson,' London 1917, p. 113. Finally, it is a fact that, \"he remained sceptical and even sarcastic of the finer distinctions, to which so many critics have carried literary analysis within the limits of the four main Pentateuchal documents.\"George Adam Smith, 'The Late Professor A.B. Davidson,' The Biblical World, Vol 20 No 3 1902, p.177. A piece of supportive evidence which should be considered is the fact that in a recently published collection of the letters written by Julius Wellhausen to various correspondents around the world not one was ever written to Andrew Bruce Davidson, whereas some 118 were written to and in support of William Roberston Smith.Rudolf Smend, 'Julius Wellhausen Briefe,' Mohr Siebeck  2013, p. 881.

As a person who had not pursued higher education at home, Samuel's innovations mainly came about through persistent experimentation, and his greatest successes were sometimes counter-intuitive to the assumptions of engineers at the time.  Not knowing that what he was trying to achieve with centrifugal fans was considered impossible by more educated mechanical engineers turned out to be a great blessing.
