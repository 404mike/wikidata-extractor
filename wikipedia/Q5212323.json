Slabber moved to Stevenage Borough in January 2007, staying for five months before joining Havant & Waterlooville the following season. He returned to Grays Athletic in November 2008. Slabber signed for Conference South club Woking in December 2009. Slabber signed for Eastleigh in July 2010, before moving onto Chelmsford City in March 2012.

He scored his first goal of the season with an injury-time strike in a 2\u20132 away draw at Charlton Athletic on 25 September 2010; Nurse's goal came in the third minute of additional time, heading in Damian Scannell's centre. It was to be his only goal during the first six months of the season. He ended his goal drought on 1 February 2011, scoring twice as Dagenham defeated Brentford 4\u20131 at Victoria Road, meaning the club moved off the bottom of League One. The two goals served as the catalyst for a run of goals for the remainder of the season; scoring the winning goals in home victories over Yeovil Town and Charlton Athletic, as well as scoring in games against Bournemouth and Swindon Town. Two goals in a 3\u20130 home victory over Carlisle United on the penultimate game of the season meant that Dagenham would go into the last game of the season needing to get at least a point away to Peterborough United, and hope results go their way, to avoid relegation. Nurse started as Dagenham were beaten 5\u20130 away to Peterborough, meaning the club would return to League Two.

Scannell also added that Sam Walker, whose solid performance in goal for Northampton Town helped the Cobblers to a 2\u20131 win over the Daggers on 24 September, was \"not better than Chris Lewington\". John Still added that he expected a lot of interest from other clubs in his goalkeeper, following further good performances, including a second-half penalty save from Ryan Hall in their 3\u20131 defeat to the Shrimpers in the Football League Trophy on 4 October.
