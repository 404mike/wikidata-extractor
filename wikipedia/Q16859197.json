A judge in Jamaica ordered Meteor released, but not before her owner, Richard Raynal Keene, had to pay $2000 to cover his and Broughton's costs.

Still, less than half an hour later lookouts spotted broken water ahead; although the helmsman attempted to turn Meleager, she struck. Efforts to get her off or to stem the inflow of water were unsuccessful. During the night the crew took down the masts and made rafts; once daylight arrived the task became to get everyone safely on shore. A line was strung to the shore of Bare Bush Key and all but three crewmen made it safely ashore. For the next few days the crew worked to salvage a large amount of stores and the guns."]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, Africa (Royal Navy)", "response": ["*Rear-Admiral Frederick Warren, (1831\u201334)   "]}, {"page": "Charles Warren (MP)", "response": ["A son of Richard Warren, and nephew of John Warren, he was brother to John Warren the Dean of Bangor, Pelham Warren the physician, and Frederick Warren; and so uncle to John's children Sir Charles Warren, and John Warren the mathematician.
