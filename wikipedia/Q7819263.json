Suddenly, I was his manager, not knowing anything about the business. But the important thing was, I was in the business.\" Mason and Reed wrote a song for Kathy Kirby, \"I'll Try Not to Cry\", as part of A Song for Europe 1965, the BBC's contest to choose the United Kingdom entry for that year's Eurovision Song Contest in Naples. The song was beaten by \"I Belong\". \"The Last Waltz\" became a million-selling UK number one for  Humperdinck in September 1967. In 1968, the duo scored another UK number 1 hit with Des O'Connor's recording of \"I Pretend\". Mason and Reed also wrote \"Who's Doctor Who\", a novelty song recorded by Doctor Who star Frazer Hines in 1967, but it failed to chart. They also wrote \"Marching on Together\" (aka \"Leeds! Leeds!

In April, a national concert tour started with The Temperance Seven, Chas McDevitt and Shirley Douglas and Bert Weedon, and this led to a concert tour starting on 29 April with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, The Viscounts, Vince Eager, Mark Eden, Danny Storm, Buddy Britten and Dave Reid. Before the final show at the Tower Ballroom, New Brighton, Laurie Jay announced his departure. A drummer was needed that night, and they recruited Ringo Starr, who had just returned from Hamburg after playing for Rory Storm and The Hurricanes. Jay went into management, later becoming the manager for Billy Ocean and Shirley Bassey. On returning to London, Tommy Frost became The Echoes' new drummer. After this tour Hines also left for Hamburg again, and was replaced by Ray Murray on keyboards. By May 1962, the Echoes line up became Dave Burns (guitar), Tommy Frost (drums), Ray Murray (keyboards), and Douggie Reece (bass). The Echoes performed a summer season in Douglas, Isle of Man in the \"Star Parade of 1962\", a rock and roll concert at The Crescent Pavilion. During the day they were required to play at The Palace Ballroom, playing relief for Ronnie Aldrich and The Squadronaires during the band's breaks. With the completion of the summer season, the Echoes returned to London and a meeting had been arranged with Mike Collier, who had just returned to England, after several years working in the music industry in America. He wanted to put together a team for his company, Micol Productions, and wanted the Echoes to be the rhythm section for his productions. Together with the arranger, Al Saxon, they began their association with Micol Productions. This led to the release on their first of four singles \"Sounds Like Winter\" in November 1961 on the Fontana. Other records for Micol Productions were released on Decca, Columbia and Fontana. The Echoes had already played at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, but on 3 September, they performed on the same bill as The Beatles. The year ended with a tour this time with B.
