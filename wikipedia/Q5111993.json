The alliance performed so well that for much of the early part of 1982, it appeared that it would become a centre-left coalition government at the next election. In 1982, uneasy about the Alliance, Owen challenged Jenkins for the leadership of the SDP, but was defeated by 26,256 votes to 20,864. In the following year's General Election, the Alliance gained 25% of the vote, only slightly behind the Labour Party, but because of the first-past-the-post voting system, it won only 23 out of 650 seats.

A potential revolt by the Gang, plus twenty others suspected by Jopling, could negate the Conservatives' 45-seat majority and lead to the government being defeated in the House of Commons.  The move came at a low-point for Thatcher, following the Brixton and Toxteth riots and when the new SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance was polling strongly.  There were concerns that Stephen Dorrell would defect to the SDP, to join Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler who had defected in March.  A conciliatory approach was adopted, with meetings arranged between Gang members and senior government figures.  Thatcher's Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS), Ian Gow, took over the response to the crisis, and he considered that Jopling was overstating the risk of a significant rebellion.  The vote on the Autumn Statement passed on 8 December, with none of the Gang voting against the government, though 12 were among 14 Conservative MPs who abstained on the motion.", "By mid-1981, Thatcher's leadership was in her \"darkest hour\"; her popularity plunged after the April Brixton riot and the July Toxteth riots.  The Conservative leadership were also worried about the effects of the June SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance.  The SDP (Social Democratic Party) had been formed in March 1981 by the Gang of Four MPs who defected from the Labour Party; they were joined soon after by  Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, who defected from the Conservatives during a debate on Howe's budget.  Polling showed Thatcher's approval rating was the lowest recorded for any prime minister and below that even of the unpopular Labour Party leader Michael Foot.   The Conservative Research Department conducted polls in late summer that showed the popularity of the Alliance might render the Conservatives a minority party, achieving just 16% of the vote (compared to the SDP\u2013Liberal 40%) which would be their worst election performance for 100 years.  It was feared by the Conservative leadership that the party was close to splitting."]}]}}
