The party's new leader, David Steel, negotiated the Lib-Lab pact with Wilson's successor as prime minister, James Callaghan. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals' key demand of PR was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between finance spokesperson John Pardoe and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, who were mutually antagonistic.", "* John Pardoe (1976\u20131979)"]}, {"page": "Mebyon Kernow", "response": ["Several former Cornish MPs have been supporters of MK, including Andrew George (Liberal Democrat), Peter Bessell (Liberal Party), John Pardoe (Liberal Party), David Mudd (Conservative), and David Penhaligon (Liberal Party).Mebyon Kernow history.

The one exception was its by-election gain of Birmingham Ladywood in June 1969; this was promptly lost in the 1970 general election. The party found itself struggling to introduce its new leader Jeremy Thorpe to the public, owing to the extensive coverage and attention paid to Enoch Powell. The election result was poor for the Liberals, with Thorpe only narrowly winning his own seat in North Devon.

His campaign was largely ignored by the national party; of its leading figures only John Pardoe, the MP for North Cornwall, visited the constituency. Thorpe, supported by his wife, his mother and some loyal friends, fought hard, although much of his characteristic vigour was missing. He lost to his Conservative opponent by 8,500 votes. Overall, the Conservatives obtained a majority of 43 seats, and Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. The Liberal Party's share of the national vote fell to 13.8%, and its total seats from 13 to 11.

I wasn't originally claiming that Cornwall should be listed with all the countries. I originally put it under the United Kingdom in the brackets with England Scotland and Wales. What I would say though is that the definition given by Fram of what constitutes a country does allow for Cornwall to be included like Wales is. \"A country or territory is a geographical area, either in the sense of nation (a cultural entity) and/or state (a political entity).\" and \"Nation may refer to a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history. However, it can also refer to people who share a common territory and government (for example the inhabitants of a sovereign state) irrespective of their ethnic make-up; that is, a nation state.\" Indeed Cornwall and the Cornish people were referred to as a nation or country during the 16th and 17th century. People who have explicitly referred to Cornwall in such a way include: Thomas Agar-Robartes MP, 1910; Peter Bessell MP and John Pardoe MP, 1967; Charles Lee (author) 1898; D. H. Lawrence; Ludovico Falier, Venetian ambassador, 1531; Girolamo Ruscelli, 1561; George Lily, 1546; Johannes Honter; Polydore Vergil, official historian of Henry VII and VIII; Sebastian M\u00fcnster, 1538; Francis Bacon, 1622; Robert Louis Stevenson; John Betjeman; and A. L. Rowse. There are also the 83,966 who stated their national identity as Cornish in the United Kingdom Census 2011 and the 41% of school children registering their ethnic identity as Cornish in the same year. There are also several thousand people who speak the Cornish language. So there's definitely \"a community of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history.\" which means that there's a \"nation (a cultural entity)\" which is one of the two definitions of Country that Wikipedia lists.
