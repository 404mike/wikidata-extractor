He was a native of the Orkney island of Sanday, in Scotland, where he collected local folk tales and other antiquites.  Dennison recorded most of the information available about traditional tales told in Orkney, but to an extent \"romanticised and systematised\" parts of it in the process of transforming the stories into prose. Writing in 2004 and 2010 twenty-first century academics from the University of the Highlands and Islands and University of Glasgow indicate Traill Dennison \"relied almost exclusively on the peasantry of his native island for the raw materials of his literary work\" and he \"provided us with some authentic traditions and that he got these, as he always claimed, directly from the Orkney peasantry\". The Orcadian folklorist and antiquarian Ernest Marwick considered that Traill Dennison bridged the gap between the social classes and that he had an \"affinity with the common people\".Traill Dennison published the folk stories, many in the local Orcadian dialect, in 1880 under the title The Orcadian Sketch-Book (William Peace & Son, Kirkwall).  Also author of the ten Sanday Revival Hymns (published anonymously, 1861, Edinburgh).\nMarried with one daughter, he died on 3 September 1894 after a short illness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David MacRitchie", "response": ["Fairy Euhemerism, as developed by MacRitchie attempts to rationally explain the origin of fairies in British folklore and regards fairies as being a folk-memory of a \"small-statured pre-Celtic race\" or what Tylor theorised as possible folk memories of the aborigines of Britain.The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries, by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, 1911, p. 234 Tylor, \"Primitive Culture\", 1871, pp. 385\u2013386. MacRitchie's theory subsequently became known in the late 19th century by folklorists as the \"Ethnological or Pygmy Theory\".Wentz, 1911, pp. 234\u2013235. The euhemeristic theory of fairies became considerably popular through MacRitchie's key works The Testimony of Tradition (1890) and Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893).\"Were Fairies an Earlier Race of Men?\", Canon J. A. Macculloch, Folklore, Vol. 43, No. 4, 31 December 1932, p. 366.\"Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics\", Part 9, James Hastings, Kessinger Publishing (reprint), 2003. p. 126. Different theories, however, in the late 19th century and early 20th century surfaced concerning the racial origin of the proposed dwarf aborigines of Britain and these theories ranged from proposing that they were real African Pygmies, Eskimos or a short statured Mediterranean race.\"Folklore and the fantastic in nineteenth-century British fiction\", Jason Marc Harris, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, pp.64\u201366.The fairy tales of Oscar Wilde, Jarlath Killeen, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, p. 137.The different racial theories are found discussed at length by T. Rice Holmes in his Ancient Britain and the invasions of Julius Caesar (1907). MacRitchie himself argued in his Testimony of Tradition, under a chapter subheading entitled \"A Hairy Race\" (p.\u00a0167), that they were somewhat connected to the Lapps or Eskimos, but were a distinct race because of their very long beards, concluding: \"one seems to see the type of a race that was even more like the Ainu than the Lapp, or the Eskimo, although closely connected in various ways with all of these\" (p.\u00a0173). In MacRitchie's view the indigenous population of Britain were thus a \"quasi-European\" Ainu race, with minor Mongoloid traits who he considered ancestral to the Picts, a view earlier proposed by Walter Scott.Scott pioneered the \"Lapp\u2212Dwarf parallel\", writing \"there seems reason to conclude that these duergar [dwarfs] were originally nothing else than the diminutive natives of the Lappish, Lettish and Finnish nations.\"Science, Vol. 21, No. 523, 10 February 1893, pp. 82\u201383.Cowan, 2001, p. 21. The identification of fairies with Picts MacRitichie based primarily on the earlier accounts by Adam of Bremen and the Historia Norwegi\u00e6 which describe the Picts of Orkney as \"only a little exceeding pygmies in stature\".Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), footnote 51 MacRitchie also discovered through The Orcadian Sketch-Book by Walter Traill Dennison (1880) that legends across Scotland describe the homes (usually underground dwellings) of the fairies as \"Pict's Houses\" and so he believed the Picts were literally the basis of fairies in British folklore.The testimony of tradition, David MacRitchie, Paul. Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, 1890, pp.60\u201367.Cowan, 2001, p. 21. In Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), The Northern Trolls (1898) and The Aborigines of Shetland and Orkney (1924) MacRitchie attempted to further identify the fairies of British folklore with the Finfolk of Orkney mythology, the Trows of Shetland myth, the Fianna of Old Irish Literature and the Trolls as well as the Svart\u00e1lfar and Svart\u00e1lfaheimr (elves or dwarfs) of Norse mythology. A 12th-century Irish manuscript is found referenced in Fians, Fairies and Picts which equates the Fianna to fairies, but this is one of the few literary sources MacRitchie used as evidence; instead he turned to philology and comparative mythology.Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), footnote 21"]}, {"page": "Sanday, Orkney", "response": ["* Walter Traill Dennison (1826\u20131894), Orcadian folklorist born on Sanday at North Myre, living most of his life at West Brough."]}, {"page": "Selkie", "response": ["Children born between man and seal-folk may have webbed hands, as in the case of the Shetland mermaid whose children had \"a sort of web between their fingers\", or \"Ursilla\" rumoured to have children sired by a male selkie, such that the children had to have the webbing between their fingers and toes made of horny material clipped away intermittently.

The term nuckelavee derives from Orcadian knoggelvi, and according to Orkney resident and 19th-century folklorist Walter Traill Dennison means \"Devil of the Sea\". The same demon is called a mukkelevi in Shetland, where it was considered a nasty sea trow or sea devil. Samuel Hibbert, an antiquarian of the early nineteenth century, considered the component nuck of the nuckelavee's name to be cognate with both the Nick in Old Nick, a name sometimes given to the Devil of Christian belief, and with the Latin necare, to kill."]}, {"page": "The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry", "response": ["A cognate to the \"Grey Selkie of Suleskerry\" includes \"The Play of Lady Odivere\" (\"The Play of de Lathie Odivere\").

The tale was preserved by 19th-century antiquarian Walter Traill Dennison, and retold by another Orcadian folklorist, Ernest Marwick, in a 20th-century version that integrates Dennison's texts with tidbits from other oral storytellers.", "According to folklorists Jennifer Westwood and Sophia Kingshill, the name Assipattle translates as Ash-paddle, very similar to Askeladd (Ash-Lad), a character in Norwegian folk stories. The Sanday folklorist Walter Traill Dennison, who transcribed the tales, defines Ass as the local dialect for ashes and to pattle as similar to the up and down flailing movements a fish makes with its tail while attempting to escape if floundering at the water's edge. Tom Muir, an Orkney folklorist and author, translates Assipattle as \"a person who rakes through the ashes\". Other spelling variants, Ashiepattle, Aessi-pattle or Assie pattle, share a common definition of a Cinderella type figure, an unkempt, idle and uncared for child who spends a large amount of time huddled at the fireside and may be evolved from Old Norse."]}, {"page": "Witchcraft in Orkney", "response": ["In Scotland witch-hunts began around 1550; the parliament of Mary, Queen of Scots passed the Scottish Witchcraft Act in 1563 making witchcraft convictions a capital punishment. Although the Orkney archipelago was officially under Norwegian law until 1611, at which time it was abolished by an act of the Privy Council of Scotland, it had been held by Scotland from 1468 under the rule of Scottish earls. Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, known as Black Patie, had control of the islands in 1594 at the time of the initial witch trials but later trials were overseen by James Law who took on the role of sheriff after he had been appointed Bishop of Orkney by King James. In contrast to the mainland where the Privy Council oversaw trials, there are no records of it having any involvement on Orkney where, from 1615, the Procurator Fiscal instigated hearings in the Sheriff Court or they were heard by the church elders. The Witchcraft Act not only allowed the execution of witches but also those who sought advice from them. Patie treated the islanders with contempt and tended to impose extremely heavy penalties on the advice seekers. When the Privy Council questioned him about it in 1609, he replied that without the severe penalties the islanders \"wald all have becommit witches and warlockis for the people ar naturally inclynit thairto\". King James also considered Orkney as one of the places where sorcery and magic were widespread, mentioning it in his book Daemonologie. Early to mid-19th century sailors held a similar conviction concerning the archipelago: Walter Traill Dennison, a folklorist and native of Sanday, born in 1825, had been taken on an excursion to Leith as a child. An elderly sailor sat the boy on his lap while recounting him a tale; when he discovered Traill Dennison was a visitor from Orkney, he recoiled from him in fear crying \"O, my lad, you hail from that lubber land where so many cursed witches dwell.\""]}]}}
