The match turned into a riot when the crowd invaded the field during a dispute over the Victorian umpire's impartiality. Wills, leading his men from the Domain, was struck in the face by a stone, and professionals George Marshall and William Greaves fled the city, reducing the Victorian side to nine men. Wills took 8 wickets and top scored in both innings (25* and 17*), but Victoria lost by 84 runs. The Melbourne media castigated Wills for allowing the game to continue and called him a traitor when evidence surfaced that he agreed to play for New South Wales in the weeks prior to the match. He denied all accusations and wrote in an angry letter to The Sydney Morning Herald: \"I for one do not think that Victoria will ever send an Eleven up here again.\" Back in Victoria, he became engaged to Julie Anderson, a farmer's daughter from Skipton and friend of the Wills family. Her name does not appear in any of Wills' surviving letters; he rarely mentioned the women he courted, let alone his feelings for them. Wills stayed in Geelong for the start of the 1863 football season, breaking his promise of an early return to Cullin-la-ringo, much to the dismay of his mother and the holding's trustees."]}, {"page": "George Marshall (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Marshall may also refer to:", "*George Marshall (academic), principal of Trevelyan College, University of Durham", "*George Marshall (athlete) (1877\u2013?), British runner", "*George Marshall (conservationist) (1904\u20132000), American conservationist and political activist", "*George Marshall (Victoria cricketer) (1829\u20131868), Australian cricketer who played for Victoria", "*George Marshall (Tasmania cricketer) (1832\u20131905), Australian cricketer who played for Tasmania", "*George Marshall (New Zealand cricketer) (1863\u20131907), New Zealand cricketer", "*George Marshall (environmentalist) (born 1964), British environmentalist", "*George Marshall (footballer, born 1869) (1869\u20131938), English footballer", "*George Marshall (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u2013?), English footballer", "*George Marshall (MP), Member of Parliament (MP) for Boroughbridge 1614-1621", "*George Marshall (director) (1891\u20131975), actor and director", "*George Marshall (philanthropist) (1753\u20131819), curate in Horsham, England", "*George Marshall (warden) (died 1658), English educational administrator", "*George Marshall (Jamaica), elected to the House of Assembly of Jamaica in 1820"]}, {"page": "List of Victoria first-class cricketers", "response": ["||39||George Marshall||14 January 1857||1856/57\u20131863/64||11"]}]}}
