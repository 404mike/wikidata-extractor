However, the population in the parishes to the east of the City was rising and this led to a need to break up the large ancient parish of Stepney into smaller units to provide adequate religious and civil administration. It was the industries associated with the River Thames, such as shipbuilding and the docks, that encouraged growth in the east, and by 1650, Shadwell was a developed maritime settlement. The docks in Tower Hamlets started to reach capacity in the early 19th century, and in 1855 the Royal Victoria Dock was opened in Newham. By 1882, Walter Besant and others, were able to describe East London as a city in its own right, on account of its large size and social disengagement from the rest of London.All Sorts and Conditions of Men, Walter Besant 1882.", "The etymology of London is uncertain, but is known to be an ancient name. The concept of East London as a distinct area is a relatively recent innovation. John Strype's map of 1720 describes London as consisting of four parts: The City of London, Westminster, Southwark and \"That Part Beyond the Tower\". From the late 19th century the term East End of London was used to describe areas immediately adjacent to the City in the Tower division of Middlesex. Charles Booth in 1889 defined East London as the County of London between the City and the River Lea.Descriptive Map of London Poverty, Charles Booth, 1889 In 1902 he now considered this area to be the \"true East End\", and his attention had been drawn eastward over the Lea into the Borough of West Ham, which was then outside London, and geographically in Essex, but under the authority of neither; in 1857 Charles Dickens termed it \"London-over-the-Border\". Walter Besant described East London as an area north of the Thames and east of the City that stretched as far as Chingford and Epping Forest,East London, Sir Walter Besant, Century Company, 1901 which was similar to the definition used by Robert Sinclair in 1950 that stretched east to include Barking and Dagenham.East London: The east and north-east boroughs of London and Greater London (County book series), Robert Sinclair, 1950 This broadly matched the Metropolitan Police District east of the city and north of the Thames at that time, and now corresponds to the boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest in Greater London."]}, {"page": "Angel One", "response": ["Producer Herbert Wright explained that the episode was to be a commentary on Apartheid in South Africa, with men on the planet representing black people.
