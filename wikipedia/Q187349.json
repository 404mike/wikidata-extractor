Watson, known as Dr. Watson, is a fictional character in the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Along with Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson first appeared in the novel A Study in Scarlet (1887). The last work by Doyle featuring Watson and Holmes is the short story \"The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\" (1927), though this is not the last story in the timeline of the series, which is \"His Last Bow\" (1917).\nWatson is Holmes' best friend, assistant and flatmate. He is the first person narrator of all but four of the stories of the cases that he relates. Watson is described as a classic Victorian-era gentleman, unlike the more eccentric Holmes. He is astute and intelligent, although he fails to match his friend's deductive skills.\nAs Holmes' friend and confidant, Watson has appeared in various films, television series, video games, comics and radio programmes.", "link_mentions": []}}
