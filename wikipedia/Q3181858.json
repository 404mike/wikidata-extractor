The delegates that walked out reconvened at another venue where Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh and Mulcahy from the \"Provisional\" Army Council were elected to the Caretaker Executive of \"Provisional\" Sinn F\u00e9in. Despite the declared support of that faction of Sinn F\u00e9in, the early Provisional IRA avoided political activity, instead relying on physical force republicanism. \u00a3100,000 was donated by the Fianna F\u00e1il-led Irish government in 1969 to \"defence committees\" in Catholic areas, some of which ended up in the hands of the IRA. This resulted in the 1970 Arms Crisis where criminal charges were pursued against two former government ministers and others including John Kelly, an IRA volunteer from Belfast. The Provisional IRA maintained the principles of the pre-1969 IRA, considering both British rule in Northern Ireland and the government of the Republic of Ireland to be illegitimate, and the Army Council to be the provisional government of the all-island Irish Republic. This belief was based on a series of perceived political inheritances which constructed a legal continuity from the Second D\u00e1il of 1921\u20131922. The IRA recruited many young nationalists from Northern Ireland who had not been involved in the IRA before, but had been radicalised by the violence that broke out in 1969. These people became known as \"sixty niners\", having joined after 1969. The IRA adopted the phoenix as the symbol of the Irish republican rebirth in 1969, one of its slogans was \"out of the ashes rose the Provisionals\", representing the IRA's resurrection from the ashes of burnt-out Catholic areas of Belfast."]}, {"page": "Maghera", "response": ["* John Kelly (1936\u20132007), founder member and a leader of the Provisional Irish Republican Army."]}, {"page": "Arms Crisis", "response": ["Haughey met with the IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding.

In November 1969, a Belfast republican leader named John Kelly, and Haughey's brother Jock, traveled to London to purchase arms, but Kelly became suspicious that their plot had been discovered and they returned to Ireland.", "On 28 May 1970, Haughey and Blaney went on trial in Dublin, together with an Irish Army intelligence officer, Captain James Kelly, John Kelly and Belgian businessman Albert Luykx, who had allegedly agreed to use his contacts to acquire the weapons. All charges against Blaney were dropped in the District Court on 2 July 1970 and as a result he was not tried, before the main trial got underway under Justice Aindrias \u00d3 Caoimh. The trial collapsed a week later after allegations of bias. Following a second trial the other four defendants were cleared on 23 October.CAIN \u2013 Chronology of the Conflict \u2013 1970  \u2014 from the CAIN project at the University of Ulster."]}]}}
