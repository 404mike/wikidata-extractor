A right-hand batsman and a wicketkeeper, Sidwell made 392 appearances for Leicestershire County Cricket Club between 1913 and 1933. His 551 catches and 127 stumpings were a county record until beaten by Roger Tolchard, and his keeping skill made him a rival of incumbent national keeper Herbert Strudwick though Sidwell was never selected for England. Two of his three centuries came in the 1928 season where he hit 1,153 runs, and he batted in both the lower and top order.", "link_mentions": {}}}
