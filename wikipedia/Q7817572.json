A right-hand batsman and a wicketkeeper, Sidwell made 392 appearances for Leicestershire County Cricket Club between 1913 and 1933. His 551 catches and 127 stumpings were a county record until beaten by Roger Tolchard, and his keeping skill made him a rival of incumbent national keeper Herbert Strudwick though Sidwell was never selected for England. Two of his three centuries came in the 1928 season where he hit 1,153 runs, and he batted in both the lower and top order.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Belgrave, Leicester", "response": ["*Tom Sidwell - cricketer - born in Belgrave."]}, {"page": "Percy Corrall", "response": ["Corrall was a lower-order right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper and, at , one of the smallest first-class cricketers. Having played for the second eleven since 1927, he made his first-class debut for Leicestershire in a single game in the 1930 season, against Cambridge University, in which he failed to make a dismissal. He returned to second eleven cricket for 1931 but at the end of that season Tom Sidwell, who had been the regular first-team wicketkeeper since before the First World War, retired. Corrall took over as the wicketkeeper in the 1932 season and played in every Leicestershire first-class match that season, making 39 catches and 11 stumpings and batting at No 10 or No 11."]}, {"page": "John Shields (cricketer)", "response": ["Leicestershire's record in 1912 and 1913 was marginally better, although in both seasons they lost more matches than any other side. Shields appears to have been a cheerful captain: Wisden noted again in its review of the 1913 season that he \"again faced a somewhat thankless task in the best possible spirit\". He missed some matches in 1913, being replaced as wicketkeeper by Tom Sidwell, and at the end of the season he resigned the captaincy. He played only two more matches for Leicestershire, one each in 1914 and 1923."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Among their better players were the wicket-keepers Tom Sidwell and Percy Corrall; batsmen Norman Armstrong, Les Berry and Eddie Dawson; and bowlers Ewart Astill, George Geary and Haydon Smith."]}]}}
