Local poor-rates payers still elected their local Board of Poor Law Guardians and still paid for local poor law provisions, but those provisions could be specified to the Board of Guardians by the Poor Law Commission; where they were the views of the local rate-payers were irrelevant. The Act was passed by large majorities, despite Oastler personally lobbying Tory leaders (including the Duke of Wellington) to oppose it. Oastler's objections were that the Act pursued aims dictated by political economy by un-Christian treatment of the poor (and particularly of the married poor: \"whom God hath joined together let no man part asunder\"), and to ensure this was done with consistent heartlessness was setting up an unconstitutional body. Oastler told the Duke \"if that Bill passes, the man who can produce the greatest confusion in the country will be the greatest patriot, and I will try to be that man\". The chairman of the Commission was Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, an exact contemporary of Thornhill at Eton", "thumb|One of the 'Somerset House Despots': Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, (Chairman of Poor Law Commission 1834\u201339: at Eton with Oastler's employer 1792\u201398)The new dispensation was implemented progressively, starting with the southern counties of England, where it achieved a considerable reduction in the poor rates. Not until January 1837 were the first steps taken to introduce the system into the West Riding by setting up 'poor law unions' and electing Boards of Guardians for them. The Poor Law Boards were then to appoint a clerk to administer whatever system of relief was specified for that Union by the central Commission. The Commission intended (or said they intended) to allow the new Poor Law Boards in manufacturing areas to continue out-relief, but opponents of the New Poor Law held that best way to defend out-relief was to prevent new Poor Law Boards being established (or clerks to Poor Law Boards being appointed), since their existence would greatly facilitate the cessation of out-relief should the Commission change its mind (or not be telling the truth). Short Time Committee men played a prominent part in organising protest meetings, disruption of Poor Law Board meetings (Keighley, Huddersfield) and/or election of anti- Poor Law 'Poor Law Guardians' (Huddersfield)."]}, {"page": "William Grant (Master of the Rolls)", "response": ["On 24 June 1824, he was appointed to the Royal Commission for inquiring into the nature and extent of the Instruction afforded by the several Institutions in Ireland established for the purpose of Education where he served with the other Commissioners: Thomas Frankland Lewis, John Leslie Foster, James Glassford and Anthony Richard Blake.A copy of the Report of the Commission is available at: http://eppi.dippam.ac.uk/documents/9883/eppi_pages/217631 (accessed 18/11/2012)."]}, {"page": "Poor Law Amendment Act 1834", "response": ["thumb|One of the \"Somerset House Despots\": Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, Chairman of Poor Law Commission 1834\u201339", "*Thomas Frankland Lewis \u2013 former Tory MP"]}, {"page": "Thomas Lewis", "response": ["*Thomas Frankland Lewis (1780\u20131855), British Poor Law Commissioner"]}, {"page": "Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Frankland Lewis"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Radnor||Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, Bt||Liberal"]}, {"page": "Wellington\u2013Peel ministry", "response": ["| Thomas Frankland Lewis"]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Frankland, 5th Baronet", "response": ["*Anne Frankland (d. 1842), married first John Lewis (by whom she bore Thomas Frankland Lewis), second Rev.
