Reddy's first season was somewhat disappointing as the player was still recovering from a medial ligament injury and struggled to regain full fitness. Despite this Reddy was utilised as Town's favoured striker, mainly playing alongside Martin Gritton, Matt Harrold or Colin Cramb throughout this season. Notably though he did finish the season on a high scoring a hat trick against already doomed Kidderminster Harriers.

Grimsby was to be his first professional football club in two years. Despite being offered a contract, Marcelle found it extremely hard to break into the team and was often looked past in favour for Michael Reddy, Andy Parkinson and Darren Mansaram, and would often find it very difficult on winning a place on the substitute bench. Marcelle made his only start for the Mariners against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, and following only four other sub appearances, Marcelle would not play again for Grimsby.

Although still under contract to League Two rivals Chesterfield, Gritton was allowed to join Torquay on loan until January 2011.  Another (more recent) fan favourite, Guy Branston also re-joined the Gulls, with the combative defender agreeing a permanent one-year deal having been on loan from Burton Albion for the latter half of the 2009\u201310 season.  However, another Plainmoor hero, Wayne Carlisle, was deemed a free agent after the winger failed to agree a new contract due, in part, to his ongoing struggle with injury.", "In recognition of Torquay's impressive start to the season, Paul Buckle was named League Two Manager of the Month for August.  However, after a near perfect August, September was to prove something of a reality check for the Gulls.  With Torquay's clean sheet record ending against Port Vale in their previous match, a 2\u20131 defeat away to Southend in their first game of the month put to an end a twelve match unbeaten run in the League which had stretched back to March.  This was then followed up by two successive 0\u20130 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage.  Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net.  With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were starting to look a little light up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.", "Another year, another transfer window and another FA Cup run for Torquay United.  Despite being the favourite with many bookmakers to take over at Bristol Rovers, Paul Buckle was left to focus on his job at Plainmoor after Dave Penney was installed as the new manager at the Memorial Stadium.  As is often the case, most of the transfer activity was left until the last day of January, although two predictable changes did take place early in the month with Kieran Charnock making his loan move to Morecambe a permanent one and Martin Gritton returning to parent club Chesterfield after the striker had failed to make an impression during his second spell at the club.
