As The Telegraph recounted, Pearson and the orchestra improvised accompaniments with about 20 minutes of rehearsal time per song, and the musicians, \"almost all middle-aged, often struggled with the enormous range of rock and pop tunes with which they were presented.\" In contrast, The Times said upon Pearson's passing in 2011 that the orchestra \"often elicit[ed] excellent performances with barely enough time beforehand for a couple of run-throughs.\""]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Johnny Pearson (1925\u20132011)"]}, {"page": "Kyu Sakamoto", "response": ["\"Ue o Muite Aruk\u014d\" has been covered multiple times over the years, beginning with the instrumental by Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen. \"Ue o Muite Aruk\u014d\" was also covered as an instrumental, by English pianist Johnny Pearson, during 1982.

Themes in the United States that have become associated with a sport include Johnny Pearson's \"Heavy Action\" (used for many years as an intro to Monday Night Football), \"Roundball Rock\" (composed by John Tesh) as the theme for the NBA on NBC during the 1990s and early 2000s, and for Fox College Hoops (from 2018\u201319 to present) and Jr. NBA Championships (2019\u2013present), \"Bugler's Dream\" (used in ABC and NBC's coverage of the Olympic Games) and the theme to ESPN's sports highlight show, SportsCenter. A notable theme that was once associated with a sport, but because of its popularity, spread network-wide was the NFL on Fox theme, which is now used for Major League Baseball on Fox (2010\u2013present) and NASCAR on Fox (2011\u20132015) and Fox UFC (2012\u20132018) and Premier Boxing Champions (December 2018 to July/August 2019) and Jr. NBA Championships (unknown-2018) broadcasts, and is regarded as the network's single theme by October 2010.

This shot usually consists of showing the quarterback throwing the football, then the camera zooming in to focus on the spinning ball, then, as the ball starts to descend, the camera zooms out, showing the end result of the ball traveling into the receiver's hands. NFL Films also dubs sound bites of local radio broadcasts over key plays, because radio announcers are typically more enthusiastic about their home teams than are network television broadcasters. In addition, NFL Films often uses multiple camera angles (with an emphasis on close-up shots that often exaggerate the speed of the players in real time).  The company's films also employ muscular orchestral scores from a wide variety of musicians, notably Sam Spence, Johnny Pearson (whose \"Heavy Action\" became the theme for Monday Night Football) Frank Rothman, Ralph Dollimore, Udi Harpaz, Malcolm Lockyer, Jan Stoeckart (under his varied stage names such as Jack Trombey), Peter Reno, Paul Lewis, Prameela Tomashek, Dave Robidoux and Tom Hedden.

ITV executives, however, were sceptical of that idea, because it was thought that viewers would not want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday (there had only been one half-hour news programme in Britain previously \u2013 BBC2's Newsroom, launched in 1964). However, the idea was approved on the condition it ran for a 13-week trial, and News at Ten was born on 3 July 1967. ITN's head newscasters \u2013 Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, and George Ffitch \u2013 presented the first News at Ten, and the bulletin became so popular with viewers that it was kept in the schedules after its initial 13 weeks. The programme's titles used an excerpt of The Awakening, a piece of dramatic music composed by Johnny Pearson. The famous chimes of the Westminster Clock Tower \u2013 affectionately known as the bongs \u2013 separated each headline as it was read out. The early opening title sequences were simplistic; for the first two years, the ITN symbol faded into a wide studio shot showing the two newscasters at the desk, with the caption News at 10. Then, in 1969, a new title sequence was introduced: a slow pan of the Houses of Parliament was followed by a sharp zoom into the face of \"Big Ben\" showing the time of 22:00. The text \"Independent Television News\" was shown at the start of the sequence, followed by the individual words \"NEWS\", \"at\" and \"TEN\", which appeared in time to the title music. The sequence was amended a year later to feature the new ITN logo at the beginning. The logo, introduced in 1970, was a simple sans-serif outline of the phrase \"ITN\".
