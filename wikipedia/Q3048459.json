More significantly, it was also the first co-production between the BFI and the newly established Channel 4, which gave the BFI a regular television platform and correspondingly greater exposure for its work. Behind the scenes, C4 also became a significant contributor to Production Board funds in general as well as specific individual works. Other films that benefited from the collaboration included The Gold Diggers (Sally Potter, 1983), Nineteen Nineteen (Hugh Brody, 1985) and Ascendancy (Edward Bennett, 1983), the last of which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. Subsequent international successes for British art house included a Silver Bear at Berlin for Derek Jarman's Caravaggio and the International Film Critics' Prize for Terence Davies' Distant Voices, Still Lives at the Cannes Film Festival. Alan Burton and Steven Chibnall refer to this period as the Board's \"golden age\"."]}]}}
