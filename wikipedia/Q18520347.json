They dined with the students, conversing with them and each other on scholarly topics. Pendlebury wrote his first impressions to his father, that they were so learned, \"It makes me feel such an impostor being there at all.\". He soon found the companionship more to his liking. He hiked the Greek countryside with Sylvia Benton, who had excavated in Ithaca, competing with her to see who could walk the fastest, and became friends with Pierson Dixon, later British ambassador to France. He struck up a friendship also with another archaeology student, Hilda White, 13 years older than he and several inches shorter. Exploring the Acropolis of Athens with her, he climbed over the parapet and announced to the guard \"I am a Persian.\""]}, {"page": "Homer's Ithaca", "response": ["* W.A.
