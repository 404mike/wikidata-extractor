He was born at Long Whatton, Leicestershire and died at Leicester.\nLester was a right-handed batsman used for many years by Leicestershire as an opening batsman and a right-arm leg-break and googly bowler who amassed more than 300 rather expensive first-class wickets despite rarely being used as a front-line bowler. Every single one of his 373 first-class matches between 1937 and 1958 was played for Leicestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Walker (Australian sportsman)", "response": ["He performed the unusual feat of taking four wickets in four balls for Nottinghamshire against Leicestershire at Leicester in 1956. Uniquely, he took the last wicket of Leicestershire's first innings (Jack Firth), and then the first three wickets of the second innings with his first three balls (Gerry Lester, Maurice Tompkin and Gerald Smithson)."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Leicestershire had fourteen defeats and finished fourteenth. In Les Berry, they had the only professional captain in the County Championship. In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, Vic Jackson, Gerry Lester, Francis Prentice, Maurice Tompkin and George Watson all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder Anthony Riddington scored over 800. Wicketkeeper Percy Corrall claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was Jack Walsh, a great exponent of slow left-arm wrist-spin, who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran James Sperry bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler. Other players were Thomas Chapman, Jack Howard and Harry Pickering.Playfair, pp. 106\u2013107."]}, {"page": "Dennis Constable", "response": ["The younger brother of Surrey cricketer Bernie Constable, Dennis made two first-class appearances for Northamptonshire in 1949 against Leicestershire and the touring New Zealanders, both at the County Ground, Northampton.  In the match against Leicestershire he scored 8 runs in Northamptonshire's first-innings, before being dismissed by Gerry Lester, while in their second-innings he wasn't required to bat.  In Leicestershire's first-innings he took two catches and in their second he followed up with another catch and a stumping.  Against the New Zealanders, Constable batted at number eleven in Northamptonshire's first-innings, being dismissed for 12 by Ces Burke thanks to a stumping off his bowling by Frank Mooney.  In their second-innings he wasn't required to bat.  He took a single catch in the New Zealanders first-innings and followed that up with another in their second."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Lees (cricketer)", "response": ["He later made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Leicestershire in the 1951 County Championship at the County Ground, Hove. Sussex won the toss and elected to bat first, making 328 all out, with Lees being stumped for a single run off the bowling of Gerry Lester. Leicestershire then made 147 all out in their first-innings, with them being forced to follow-on in their second-innings, which saw them dismissed for 117. Sussex won the match by an innings and 64 runs."]}, {"page": "Peter Konig", "response": ["Born in Vienna to Jewish parents, his family likely fled Austria following its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938, arriving in the United Kingdom at some point thereafter. Konig later made a single first-class appearance for Leicestershire against Northamptonshire at the County Ground, Northampton in 1949. In Northamptonshire's first-innings of 239 all out, Konig made a single stumping when he stumped Gordon Garlick off the bowling of Gerry Lester. In Leicestershire's first-innings response, Konig was the last man out, dismissed for 6 runs by Des Barrick. In Northamptonshire's second-innings of 350/5 declared, Konig caught Percy Davis off the bowling of Charles Wooler. This was his only major appearance for the county."]}, {"page": "Gerald Lester", "response": ["#REDIRECTGerry Lester"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 1998", "response": ["*Gerry Lester, 82, English cricketer."]}]}}
