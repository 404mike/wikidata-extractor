He was born at Long Whatton, Leicestershire and died at Leicester.\nLester was a right-handed batsman used for many years by Leicestershire as an opening batsman and a right-arm leg-break and googly bowler who amassed more than 300 rather expensive first-class wickets despite rarely being used as a front-line bowler. Every single one of his 373 first-class matches between 1937 and 1958 was played for Leicestershire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
