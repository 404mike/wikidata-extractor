Upon publication, Jeremy Horder wrote that the \"book will confirm Brian Leiter 's place in the front rank of legal theorists in the world today.\"  Leiter also wrote the entry on \"Naturalism in Legal Philosophy\" for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  On his view, \"philosophers generally should aim to unpack the 'concepts that have been vindicated by their role in successful explanation and prediction of empirical phenomena'\" and thus should \"'take seriously the\u2026social scientific literature on law\u2026to see what concept of law figures in the most powerful explanatory and predictive models of legal phenomena such as judicial behavior.' This methodological view, however, raises questions about why the legal philosopher should study only judicial behavior and not something else. More generally, the naturalist owes an account of what features of law are most in need of explication and why.\""]}, {"page": "List of Old Felstedians", "response": ["* Jeremy Horder (b. 1962), Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, Professor Criminal Law, LSE (Who's Who)"]}, {"page": "Horder", "response": ["*Jeremy Horder (born 1962), Professor of Criminal Law at LSE"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2010s", "response": ["* Jeremy Horder, Professor of Criminal Law, London School of Economics"]}]}}
