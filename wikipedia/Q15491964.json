Although Schooley and McCorkle participated in designing Kim, the majority of that particular task was the combined efforts of Loter, inaugural season director Chris Bailey, art director Alan Bodner and character designer Stephen Silver, each of whom had worked together on previous animated projects. Due to their extensive animation experience, Schooley and McCorkle were aware that \"Kim had to be an appealing character\", while Ron would be more-so \"goofy-appealing\". Evolving dramatically over the course of three months, Kim, who had originally been designed to resemble a \"standard\" athletic-looking blonde heroine, underwent several changes. At one point, the character's appearance was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider franchise until Disney Channel abandoned this concept in favor of one more akin to that of a 14 year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell. Admitting that Kim would have been their dream girl in high school, the creators joked, \"She would have been way out of our class though.\" A super suit designed for the character was introduced in early Season 4 but quickly abandoned once the writers realized that the costume would detract from the character's established \"she can do anything\" reputation. However, her original mission outfit consisting of a crop top and cargo pants is permanently replaced by a T-shirt and pants. Meanwhile, the outfits of Team Impossible were influenced by the X-Men's \"classic\" blue and gold uniforms."]}, {"page": "The Evolution of Trickster Stories Among the Dogs of North Park After the Change", "response": ["It was shortlisted for the 2007 Nebula Award for Best Novelette.Nebula nominees list at Locus, retrieved December 19, 2010 and the 2008 World Fantasy Award\u2014Short Fiction.News archive: 9 August 2008: World Fantasy Awards Nominations at SF Site, by Stephen Silver, retrieved December 19, 2010"]}, {"page": "Silver Reuben Award", "response": ["*2007 Stephen Silver (Kim Possible)"]}, {"page": "1972 in animation", "response": ["* August 30: Stephen Silver, British artist, cartoonist and character designer (Kim Possible, Danny Phantom)."]}, {"page": "Silver, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Silver"]}]}}
