The film contains strong language and is much more violent and graphic than the milder BBC version. Ray Winstone, John Blundell, Phil Daniels, John Judd, Ray Burdis and Patrick Murray all reprise their respective roles as Carlin, Banks, Richards, Sands, Eckersley and Dougan from the BBC version, while all other roles are recast. David Threlfall had been intended to reprise his role as Archer from the BBC version, but he was working with the Royal Shakespeare Company at the time and was subsequently replaced by Mick Ford. The story was also changed. The BBC version features a homosexual relationship between Carlin and another inmate, which was dropped from the film. Minton later said that this was a pity as it would have expanded Carlin's character and made him vulnerable in an area where he could not afford to be vulnerable."]}, {"page": "The Firm (1989 film)", "response": ["*Patrick Murray as \"Nunk\""]}, {"page": "The Jolly Boys' Outing", "response": ["*Patrick Murray as Mickey Pearce"]}, {"page": "Yuppy Love", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Fatal Extraction", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "List of Only Fools and Horses characters", "response": ["| Patrick Murray", "| Mickey Pearce ||Patrick Murray|| \"Healthy Competition\" ||\"Sleepless in Peckham\" || 1983\u20132003 "]}, {"page": "Modern Men (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Little Problems", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Time on Our Hands", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Mother Nature's Son (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Healthy Competition", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Rodney Come Home", "response": ["* Patrick Murray as Mickey Pearce"]}, {"page": "Wanted (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Happy Returns", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Video Nasty (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Watching the Girls Go By", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Miami Twice", "response": ["*Patrick Murray as Mickey Pearce", "*Patrick Murray as Mickey Pearce"]}, {"page": "Valentine Stockdale", "response": ["| 2006 || The Dealer || production assistant || Tony Royden || John Thomson, Craig Charles, Dave Legeno, Patrick Murray, Ricky Grover."]}, {"page": "I Done It My Way", "response": ["| Patrick Murray"]}, {"page": "Patrick Murray", "response": ["Patrick Murray may refer to:", "* Patrick Murray (actor) (born 1956), English screen actor", "* Patrick Murray (courtier), Scottish courtier active in religious struggles in the 1590s", "* Patrick Murray (politician), 2010 and 2012 congressional candidate in Virginia", "* Patrick Murray (sport shooter) (1945\u20132021), Australian sport shooter", "* Patrick Murray (theologian) (1811\u20131882), Irish Roman Catholic theologian", "* Patrick Murray, 1st Earl of Tullibardine (died 1644), Scottish aristocrat", "* Patrick Murray, 1st Lord Elibank (1632\u20131649), Scottish peer", "* Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank (1703\u20131778), author  and economist", "* Pato Banton (born Patrick Murray, born 1961), reggae singer and toaster", "* Patrick Murray (American football) (born 1991), American football placekicker", "* Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre (1771\u20131837), Scottish peer and politician", "* Malcolm Patrick Murray (1905\u20131979), known as Pat or Patrick Murray, British civil servant"]}, {"page": "Spanish diaspora", "response": ["British of Spanish descent is any citizen or resident of the United Kingdom who is of Spanish ancestral origin.
