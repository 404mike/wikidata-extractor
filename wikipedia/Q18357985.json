Hansen agreed with Ferguson that United's lack of goal threat cost them on the day, but felt their future was rosier than Arsenal's. Nonetheless, he was of the opinion that Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had little to be concerned about, concluding his piece with the sentence: \"A London club did come away from Cardiff as big winners but it was not Arsenal, it was Chelsea.\" In the same newspaper, Paul Hayward praised the performances of Rooney and Ronaldo \u2013 \"surely the best one-club pairing of under-21s in world football,\" while ex-Arsenal player Alan Smith noted his former club's win demonstrated how Wenger \"for the first time, practically, in his nine-year Highbury tenure, had set up his side with the opposition in mind.\" Capturing United's sombre mood, The Times football correspondent Matt Dickinson wrote: \"The black shirts turned out not to be in protest at Glazer but a reflection of their mood after the first FA Cup Final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\""]}, {"page": "2002 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Journalists and pundits reviewing the final unanimously agreed with the outcome of the match. Matt Dickinson wrote in The Times of 6 May 2002: \"The force is with Arsenal, but it is not some ethereal presence, rather a brutish will to win derived from both triumphs and disappointments.\" The Daily Telegraph football correspondent Henry Winter was strongly critical of Ranieri's selection-making and suggested Chelsea's failure was partly down to Hasselbaink's lack of fitness, as there was no attacking threat. In contrast he commended Wenger's tactics \u2013 \"The decision by Arsenal's intelligent manager to deploy Parlour through the middle was a spectacular success\", and praised their players' mental strength and resilience. The Guardian's David Lacey also lauded Parlour's show in midfield, ranking his goal as one of the best in Cup final history. Although he agreed with the media consensus that the final was a drab affair and Arsenal's performance was not to their standard, he picked out several high-quality moments that the losing finalists failed to match, one in particular a timed-ball from Vieira. Glenn Moore of The Independent observed how Wenger turned his team of also-rans into winners, noting the manager's decision to play Adams  \"bore fruit\" as the defence dealt with Chelsea's increasing second-half pressure. Football pundit Alan Hansen called Arsenal his team of the season and believed their win was built on the experience of Adams and Seaman; of the former he wrote: \"Adams was also able to operate with the confidence that his goalkeeper was never going to make any mistakes.\""]}, {"page": "2007 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["Journalists reviewing the match praised Arsenal's young team; some however went as far to criticise their conduct in the brawl. Henry Winter wrote in The Daily Telegraph of 26 February 2007 \"\u2026all feline grace and youthful ambition, [Arsenal] were the better team, moving the ball around exquisitely at times,\" while Glenn Moore of The Independent reflected \"the Arsenal manager can take great consolation from the quality of his young footballers.\"  The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra opened his match report with the line \"To Chelsea the trophy, to Arsenal the future,\" and felt the latter club deserved plaudits for the role they played in the final, and competition as a whole. He commended Chelsea's adversity and singled out Carvalho as an example; at fault for Arsenal's goal, the defender's performance thereafter was faultless. Matt Dickinson of The Times agreed that Arsenal had played the better football, but said their temperament was \"brittle\" \u2013 \"[They] had lost the trophy before they lost their heads.\" Football pundit Alan Hansen was scathing of Arsenal's behaviour and suggested their inexperience had a part to play: \"When they reflect upon it, Arsenal will admit that they were largely in the wrong.\" He was critical of Wenger's team selection and felt the big clubs saw the competition, much like the FA Cup as an irrelevance. The violence and sendings off on the pitch led to some media outlets dubbing the match as the \"Snarling Cup Final\", or in the case of Winter's match report the \"Carnage Cup final\"."]}, {"page": "Battle of the Buffet", "response": ["Henry Winter writing for The Daily Telegraph gave a brief explanation as to why Arsenal did not perform \u2013 their striker Henry was \"not at the races.\" He was full of praise of United's determination and summarised: \"Yet though Arsenal had dominated possession, United had offered the more impressive individuals.\" Matt Dickinson of The Times described the victory as huge for \"Ferguson and his faltering squad,\" regardless of the scoreline or indeed if Arsenal had played the better football in patches. The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra felt aggrieved in the manner Arsenal had ended their unbeaten run, but pointed out they were fortunate no action was taken when Cole fouled Ronaldo. He closed his piece with an illustration of how impressive Arsenal's run was: \"In those prior 49 games they had never even been behind in the closing 20 minutes.\""]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["Arsenal hosted Everton at Highbury on the opening weekend of the season. Campbell was sent off in the 25th minute, for a professional foul on Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen. Arsenal, despite their man disadvantage, went two goals up after 58 minutes, before Tomasz Radzinski scored for the visitors late on. A trip to the Riverside Stadium to face Middlesbrough a week after ended in a 4\u20130 win; the first three goals, scored by Henry, Gilberto Silva and Sylvain Wiltord all came in the first half. Three days later, Campbell and Henry each scored as Aston Villa were beaten by two goals. Arsenal continued their perfect start to the season, with an away win against Manchester City on 31 August 2003. As Campbell was suspended, Martin Keown came into the first team to partner Tour\u00e9. Although Arsenal conceded first \u2013 a \"comical\" own goal by Lauren \u2013 and played \"the worst 45 minutes that any of their fans could remember\" according to journalist Matt Dickinson, Wiltord equalised in the second half, before Freddie Ljungberg had taken advantage of a Seaman error to score the winning goal.

They also met in the FA Cup semi-final, which was replayed after the original game ended goalless. David Beckham and Dennis Bergkamp scored for their respective clubs either side of half time, Roy Keane was dismissed, and the holders late on were awarded a penalty. Schmeichel saved Bergkamp's attempt and the tie went into extra time. Ryan Giggs memorably scored the winner, picking up possession on the halfway line and dribbling past the entire Arsenal back line before shooting past David Seaman. \"A match that had everything finished with a pitch invasion, sporadic fighting and David Beckham carried shoulder-high from the field\" wrote Matt Dickinson in The Times.

Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic echoed a similar sentiment, suggesting that Masi's decision was to ensure that \"Netflix gets another juicy storyline for the next season of Drive to Survive\", and also questioned his capability in effectively officiating a race.

Although Dickinson agreed the officiating process should be thoroughly reviewed, he rejected complaints that the decision could have been made for entertainment on the grounds that \"rules in sport are contrived \u2014 and frequently tweaked to make a sport more entertaining \u2014 and we should not pretend that there is only one perspective of justice, or that sport is an endless pursuit of fairness.\""]}]}}
