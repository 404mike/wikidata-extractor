In Hebrew, the name was rendered as \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05b7\u05d3\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d0\u05e6\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8 (N\u0259\u1e07\u016b\u1e35a\u1e0fne\u02be\u1e63\u1e63ar) and in Greek it was rendered as \u039d\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c1 (Nabouchodonosor). Some scholars, such as Donald Wiseman, prefer the anglicisation \"Nebuchadrezzar\", with an \"r\" rather than an \"n\", following the assumption that \"Nebuchadnezzar\" is a later, corrupted form of the contemporary Nab\u00fb-kudurri-u\u1e63ur. The alternate anglicisation \"Nebuchadrezzar\" derives from how the name is rendered in the Biblical Books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05b7\u05d3\u05b0\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05e6\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8 (N\u0259\u1e07\u016b\u1e35a\u1e0fre\u02be\u1e63\u1e63ar), a more faithful transliteration of the original Akkadian name. The Assyriologist Adrianus van Selms suggested in 1974 that the variant with an \"n\" rather than an \"r\" was a rude nickname, deriving from an Akkadian rendition like Nab\u00fb-k\u016bdanu-u\u1e63ur, which means 'Nabu, protect the mule', though there is no concrete evidence for this idea. Van Selms believed that a nickname like that could derive from Nebuchadnezzar's early reign, which was plagued by political instability.", "Since military activity was not a major issue described in the inscriptions of any Neo-Babylonian king regardless of their actual military accomplishments, in sharp contrast to the inscriptions of their Neo-Assyrian predecessors, Nebuchadnezzar's own inscriptions talk very little about his wars. Out of the fifty or so known inscriptions by the king, only a single one deals with military action, and in this case only small-scale conflicts in the Lebanon region. Many Assyriologists, such as Wolfram von Soden in 1954, thus initially assumed that Nebuchadnezzar had mainly been a builder-king, devoting his energy and efforts to building and restoring his country. A major change in evaluations of Nebuchadnezzar came with the publication of the tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle by Donald Wiseman in 1956, which cover the geopolitical events of Nebuchadnezzar's first eleven years as king. From the publication of these tablets and onwards, historians have shifted to perceiving Nebuchadnezzar as a great warrior, devoting special attention to the military achievements of his reign."]}, {"page": "Neriglissar", "response": ["Neriglissar's influence was further increased through his marriage to one of Nebuchadnezzar's daughters. Historian David B. Weisberg proposed in 1974 that the daughter in question was Kashshaya, since her name appears together with the name of Nebuchadnezzar, Neriglissar and Bel-shum-ishkun in economic documents. Although there is no concrete evidence that Kashshaya, instead of one of Nebuchadnezzar's other daughters, was the wife of Neriglissar, subsequent historians, such as Donald Wiseman and Jona Lendering, have accepted the assumption that Neriglissar married Kashshaya."]}, {"page": "Nabonidus", "response": ["Concrete evidence surrounding Nabonidus's religious ideas is relatively scarce and no surviving documents contain any theological foundations for the king's faith and beliefs. Not all historians share the view that Nabonidus was a religious reformer. According to Donald Wiseman, Nabonidus \"did not seek to create any exclusive role for [S\u00een] in Babylon\". Wiseman characterises Nabonidus as deeply religious and in support of Marduk, as all other Babylonian kings. In addition to the Elhulkhul temple, Nabonidus is also recorded in inscriptions as having conducted restoration work at temples in Babylon itself, Larsa, Sippar and Nippur. Wiseman attributes the opposition by religious official towards Nabonidus to that the king had introduced a new royal cash box in temples and sanctuaries, wherein some of the income of the temples was to be provided to the king, under the supervision of royal officials, and notes that Cyrus the Great's later documents referring to Nabonidus as irreverent in regards to Marduk could be propaganda. Though Nabonidus uses uncharacteristically high epithets for S\u00een in many inscriptions, Weiherh\u00e4user and Novotny pointed out that a majority of these epithets are generally limited to inscriptions and texts that document work on the Ekhulkhul temple in Harran, S\u00een's cultic centre. Thus, Weiherh\u00e4user and Novotny do not consider the evidence strong enough to support the idea that Nabonidus fanatically promoted S\u00een, and sought to fully replace Marduk, within Babylonia itself."]}, {"page": "Jeconiah", "response": ["Historians, however, have been divided on whether the year was 587 or 586 BCE. A 1990 study listed eleven scholars who preferred 587 and eleven who preferred 586.Jeremy Hughes, Secrets of the Times (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1990) 229. The Babylonian records of the second capture of Jerusalem have not been found, and scholars looking at the chronology of the period must rely on the Biblical texts, as correlated with extant Babylonian records from before and after the event. In this regard, the Biblical texts regarding Jeconiah are especially important, because the time of his reign in Jerusalem was fixed by Donald Wiseman's 1956 publication, and this is consistent with his thirty-seventh year of captivity overlapping the accession year of Amel-Marduk, as mentioned above."]}, {"page": "Wiseman (surname)", "response": ["* Donald Wiseman, English professor, archeologist and writer"]}, {"page": "Labashi-Marduk", "response": ["Labashi-Marduk was the son and heir of Neriglissar (560\u2013556 BC), the fourth king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Labashi-Marduk's mother was a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar II (605\u2013562 BC), the empire's second and most powerful king. Three daughters of Nebuchadnezzar are known; Kashshaya, Innin-etirat and Ba'u-asitu, but no cuneiform text explicitly mentions which daughter Neriglissar married. Historian David B. Weisberg proposed in 1974 that Neriglissar's wife was Kashshaya, since her name appears together with the name of Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar in economic documents.
