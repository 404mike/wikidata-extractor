He was born in Dublin, Ireland, and retained an interest in Irish history and politics.\n\nHe was best known to people in Britain as the presenter of All Our Yesterdays, a television review of events exactly 25 years previously, as seen in newsreels, newspaper articles etc.  He also presented the weekly review of newspapers known as What the Papers Say.\nHe joined the staff of The Spectator in 1954, and became editor in 1959, soon afterwards hiring the young Bernard Levin to write for the magazine. He continued as editor until 1962.\nHe also had interests in the paranormal, and alternative medicine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roger Casement", "response": ["His father, Captain Roger Casement of the (King's Own) Regiment of Dragoons, was the son of Hugh Casement, a Belfast shipping merchant who went bankrupt and later moved to Australia. Captain Casement had served in the 1842 Afghan campaign. He travelled to Europe to fight as a volunteer in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 but arrived after the Surrender at Vil\u00e1gos. After the family moved to England, Roger's mother, Anne Jephson (or Jepson), of a Dublin Anglican family, purportedly had him secretly baptised at the age of three as a Roman Catholic in Rhyl, Wales.Angus Mitchell, Casement, Haus Publishing, 2003 p. 11.Brian Inglis (1974, op cit.) commented at p. 115 that \"..although she allowed the children to be brought up as Protestants, she had them baptised 'conditionally' when Roger was four years old.\" However, the priest who arranged his baptism in 1916 clearly stated that the claimed earlier baptism had been in Aberystwyth, 80 miles from Rhyl, raising the question as to why such a supposedly-important event should also become so misremembered.Bureau of Military History, Dublin; file of Fr. Cronin (1951), WS 588, page 2.", "In 1906 the Foreign Office sent Casement to Brazil: first as consul in Santos, then transferred to Par\u00e1,Brian Inglis, \"Roger Casement\" 1973, pp. 157-65 and lastly promoted to consul-general in Rio de Janeiro.See Roger Casement in: \"Rubber, the Amazon and the Atlantic World 1884-1916\" (Humanitas) He was attached as a consular representative to a commission investigating rubber slavery by the Peruvian Amazon Company (PAC), which had been registered in Britain in 1908 and had a British board of directors and numerous stockholders. In September 1909, a journalist named Sidney Paternoster, wrote in Truth, a British magazine, of abuses against PAC workers and competing Colombians in the disputed region of the Peruvian Amazon.", "In Ireland in 1904, on leave from Africa from that year until 1905, Casement joined the Gaelic League, an organisation established in 1893 to preserve and revive the spoken and literary use of the Irish language. He met the leaders of the powerful Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) to lobby for his work in the Congo. He did not support those, like the IPP, who proposed Home Rule, as he believed that the House of Lords would veto such efforts. Casement was more impressed by Arthur Griffith's new Sinn F\u00e9in party (founded 1905), which called for an independent Ireland (through a non-violent series of strikes and boycotts). Its sole imperial tie would be a dual monarchy between Britain and Ireland, modeled on the policy example of Ferenc De\u00e1k in Hungary. Casement joined the party in 1905.Brian Inglis, Roger Casement; Harcourt Jovanovich, 1974; pp. 118\u201320; 134\u201339"]}, {"page": "Precognition", "response": ["In the early 20th century J. W. Dunne, a British soldier and aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book An Experiment with Time. In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them.Dunne (1927).Flew, Antony; \"The Sources of Serialism, in Shivesh Thakur (Ed). Philosophy and Psychical Research, George Allen & Unwin Ltd. 1976, pp. 81\u201396.  He suggested also that dream precognition did not reference any kind of future event, but specifically the future experiences of the dreamer. He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper. Edith Lyttelton, who became President of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), regarded his theory as consistent with her own idea of the superconscious.Lyttelton, Edith. Our Superconscious Mind. Philip Allan. 1931. In 1932 he helped the SPR to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society's lead researcher Theodore Besterman failed to agree on the significance of the results.Brian Inglis; The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena.

He appointed his deputy Brian Inglis, who introduced to the magazine a fresh spirit of political and satirical satire. In 1959\u2014much to the embarrassment of Gilmour (who remained the owner)\u2014The Spectator advised either voting for the Liberal Party or tactically abstaining. Despite a marked increase in sales, Gilmour felt that The Spectator was losing its political edge, so replaced him in 1962 with Iain Hamilton. Hamilton successfully balanced a keener focus on current affairs with some more raucous contributions: the young team behind Private Eye were commissioned to write a mock eight-page \"Child's Guide to Modern Culture\". Much to the shock of Hamilton and the Spectator staff, Gilmour replaced Hamilton in 1963 with Iain Macleod, the Conservative MP who had resigned from the cabinet on the controversial appointment of Sir Alec Douglas-Home to succeed Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister. A widely circulated letter, signed by Spectator journalists and board members, berated Gilmour for mistreating an admired editor and appointing an active politician who could jeopardise the independence of the magazine: \"We believe strongly that The Spectator, with its long and honourable history of independent opinion, should not be tossed about at the whim of the proprietor or lose its independence by identification with a narrow political faction.\"Letter first printed in The Times of 2 Nov. 1963.", "*Brian Inglis, 1959\u20131962"]}, {"page": "Aneurin Bevan", "response": ["The three won their case, and obtained financial damages of \u00a32,500 each.
