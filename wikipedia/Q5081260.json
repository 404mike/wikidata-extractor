He went on to qualify and work in the Royal Doulton design department. His main interest lay in clay sculpture and the design of free standing figures and he produced several prototypes for these which came to the attention of Charles Noke the Royal Doulton art director in Burslem.", "Harradine had not been back in England for long when Charles Noke got to hear about him again and set up a meeting. He offered Leslie a job as a figure designer at the Burslem works but he refused. Leslie had grown to like his independence and wanted to work only for himself. He did, however, eventually agree to send Noke some samples of his models on a freelance basis and so, in 1920, the first of his Royal Doulton figures, HN 395, 'Contentment' was released.", "Many hugely popular models flowed from his small home studio. \"Polly Peacham\" and other figures from his rendition of The Beggars Opera. \"The Balloon Seller\" and \"Flower Sellers Children\" from the London street sellers series. The Dickens series, which was a particular favourite of Charles Noke's. and, of course, the slightly risque models of \"The Bather\" both swimsuit clad and nude.", "In 1961 he moved to Spain where he lived and modelled local peasants in terra cotta for pleasure. Leslie Harradine died on 6 December 1965, in Gibraltar at age 78; the same age that his former mentor Charles Noke had retired as art director of Doulton, some 30 years prior."]}, {"page": "List of Royal Doulton figurines", "response": ["|Charles Noke", "|Charles Noke", "|Charles Noke", "|Charles Noke", "|Charles Noke", "|Charles Noke"]}, {"page": "Royal Doulton Bunnykins", "response": ["thumb|Royal Doulton Bunnykins tableware backstampRoyal Doulton Bunnykins tableware and  figurines are popular ceramic designs manufactured as nursery dishes and collectible figurines.  The chinaware line originated with artwork by Sister Mary Barbara Bailey (n\u00e9e Barbara Vernon Bailey), the daughter of Cuthbert Bailey, general manager of Doulton during the 1930s. Unbeknownst to the public, Mary Barbara Bailey was not a professional illustrator, but a nun in the Augustinian Canonesses of the Lateran.  Sister Mary Barbara provided illustrations to the designers of Doulton & Co. to be used on tableware.  Six Bunnykins figurines were produced based on Sister Mary Barbara's illustrations in 1939 and were designed by Charles Noke.  Discontinued during World War II, Bunnykins figurines were not reintroduced until 1969.  Bunnykins continued to be produced in England until 2005.  Bunnykins figurines and tableware are currently produced in Asia.", "Figurines by Charles Noke featuring various Bunnykins characters began in 1939. The first line consisted of only six designs. All factories were closed for the duration of World War II, bringing production to a halt, and thus these six figurines have also become very rare. Following the war, production of Bunnykins figurines did not restart until Royal Doulton purchased the Beswick factory in 1969. After this, Bunnykins were numbered with the prefix DB.
