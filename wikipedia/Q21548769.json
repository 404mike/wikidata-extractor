In particular, he was a \"diehard opponent\" Catholic emancipation, \"dividing doggedly against it\" and presenting a petition to the House of Commons to \"guard the country from the danger to which it was exposed from the machinations of men who were avowedly hostile to the church establishment\" if the Test Acts were repealed. He presented further anti-Catholic petitions and, in November 1828, urged the formation of a local Brunswick Club, of which he became its first president. At the local mayoral election in the same month, he \"avowed himself a staunch supporter of the Protestant cause\" and suggested that ministers looked \"favourably\" on the club and its supporters. Ultimately, however, he resigned his parliamentary seat in 1829 \"in disgust\" at the Wellington\u2013Peel ministry's concession of Catholic emancipation, by accepting the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. At a dinner celebrating the return of his replacement, Richard Sanderson, another True Blue, he said he was \"disgusted with the House of Commons\", saying emancipation would be \"the ruin of Old England\".", "Nevertheless, he remained prominent in Colchester politics, although he admitted he was \"wholly ignorant\" of the currency question relating to beer and malt taxes, but hoped the ministry would alleviate the tax burden and \"discount the radical nostrum of a property tax\". He made similar points when standing for election at Essex at a by-election in 1830, where he professed himself a \"Tory of the old school\". At that year's general election, he stood again for Colchester but withdrew from the race, which had six candidates, before the poll. At a by-election in 1831 he supported Sir William Curtis, 2nd Baronet, a Tory, in his unsuccessful bid for the seat, and at the general election of the same month, he was a prominent supporter of Richard Sanderson, who was again seeking election."]}]}}
