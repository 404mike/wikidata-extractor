When he left school in 1977, he joined Birmingham City as an apprentice, and turned professional two years later. Briggs had not yet established himself as a reserve-team regular when manager Jim Smith unexpectedly named him as substitute for the First Division match away at Manchester City on 1 May 1979. He made his debut coming on to replace Alan Buckley for what turned out to be a three-minute Football League career. He left the club to join Durham City in August 1980.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of KSDK awards", "response": ["*Sports Report: (Malcolm Briggs: \"Emily Parsons\")", "*Sports Special: (Malcolm Briggs: Max Questions-Rams 2003\")"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Malcolm Briggs"]}]}}
