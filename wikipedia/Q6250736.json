In early 2001, he joined Wycombe Wanderers, and later signed for Aldershot Town in May 2001. He enjoyed a promotion with Aldershot during the 2002\u201303 campaign, helping the club secure the Isthmian League Premier Division title. During his time at Aldershot, Nutter spent time out on loan at St Albans City and Gravesend & Northfleet respectively.\nNutter then enjoyed a fruitful two-year spell at Grays Athletic, and was part of the team that won the Conference South title, as well as two FA Trophy successes. In May 2006, he signed for Stevenage Borough, and again enjoyed FA Trophy success during the 2006\u201307 season. Nutter moved back into the Football League in November 2007, signing for Gillingham. He spent three-and-a-half seasons there, with the club moving between League One and League Two during his tenure. He was released when his contract expired at the end of the 2010\u201311 campaign, subsequently signing for Lincoln City of the Conference Premier in July 2011. He was loaned out to Woking in November 2012, a move that was later made permanent in January 2013. He spent two years at Woking, retiring from playing at the end of the 2014\u201315 season to enable him to focus further on his career as a teacher.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Woking F.C.", "response": ["* John Nutter"]}, {"page": "Jamie Stuart", "response": ["During the season, he received two red cards, the first against Exeter City on 19 November 2005 following a fight in the tunnel at half time with Exeter's Lee Phillips.

Along with Josh Gowling, John Nutter and Alan Power, Anyon was one of the club's rare permanent features throughout the campaign, keeping his first team place under both Steve Tilson and new boss David Holdsworth. He beat Gowling and Power to the Player of the Season award, and was also voted as the Away Player of the Season. During the season, he regularly issued an \"inspiring battle cry\" in the local press, talked up \"the biggest club in the Blue Square Bet Premier\", and also attempted to bring unity between the club's disgruntled supporters and embattled management. Holdsworth described Anyon as a \"big voice\", and praised his \"impeccable\" attitude. On the pitch his performances were seen as a \"huge ray of light\" from the start of the season, and coach Neil Gardner told the Lincolnshire Echo that he believed Anyon could go on to play at Championship level."]}, {"page": "Mark Stimson", "response": ["In the early part of the 2007\u201308 season, speculation began to mount that Stimson would be approached to take over as manager of a Football League club, with Gillingham, Port Vale and Millwall all alleged to be interested in his services. He was offered a new contract by Stevenage on 16 October 2007, but resigned the following day. On 1 November, he was appointed as the new manager of Gillingham, and quickly moved to sign a number of Stevenage players, including Adam Miller and John Nutter. He was unable to recreate his previous success, however, and at the end of the 2007\u201308 season Gillingham were relegated from League One. He was also criticised by departing player Aaron Brown, who acknowledged that Stimson had strong coaching skills but described his man-management as \"shocking\". The following season the Gills finished fifth in League Two and beat Shrewsbury Town 1\u20130 in the play-off Final at Wembley Stadium to gain promotion, but in the 2009\u201310 season Gillingham were relegated back to League Two, after which Stimson's contract was terminated \"by mutual consent\" on 10 May 2010."]}, {"page": "Adam Miller (footballer, born 1982)", "response": ["Stevenage manager, Mark Stimson, was appointed as the new manager of Gillingham in November 2007, and quickly moved to sign Miller and his teammate John Nutter on loan.

During the team's ultimately unsuccessful struggle to avoid relegation from League One in the 2007\u201308 season, Miller was identified as a key player and singled out for praise by Stimson, who said \"If eight players play like Adam Miller we won't be in this position but if we've only got one or two we will be\"."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 FA Trophy", "response": ["|LB ||3 || John Nutter"]}, {"page": "2009 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["The second-leg matches took place three days later.

Jackson scored a second goal with a penalty kick in the 58th minute after John Nutter had been fouled by Rory McArdle.  Gillingham thus won the match 2\u20131 and won their semi-final on aggregate by the same score.  Gillingham manager Mark Stimson was quoted as saying that reaching the final was just reward for his players' commitment throughout the season.  At Bury's Gigg Lane, Shrewsbury goalkeeper Daniels saved a penalty kick by Bury's Phil Jevons and Kevin McIntyre scored a goal for the away team in the 88th minute to level the aggregate score at 1\u20131 and require extra time to be played.  Shortly after the start of the extra period, Shrewsbury's Steve Leslie was sent off.  With no further goals being scored in extra time, the semi-final ended in a draw and a penalty shoot-out was required to decide which team would advance to the final.  Daniels saved penalty kicks from Bury's Andy Bishop and Danny Racchi and Shrewsbury won the shoot-out and thus reached the final.

Six minutes into the second-half, Stevenage halved the deficit, Morison headed the ball down to Mitchell Cole, who produced a neat right-footed finish to beat Scott Bevan in the Kidderminster goal. Centre-back Santos Gaia spurned the opportunity to restore parity when his header narrowly missed the target on the hour mark.

Kidderminster responded by making an instant change, bringing on Andrew White for Iyseden Christie.
