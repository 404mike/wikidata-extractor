William Cowper was born in Berkhamsted Rectory in 1731. Although he moved away when still a boy, there are frequent references to the town in his poems and letters. In the Victorian era, Cowper became a cult figure and Berkhamsted was a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. Maria Edgeworth, a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults' and children's literature who was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe, lived in Berkhamsted as a child in the 18th century. Between 1904 and 1907, the Llewelyn Davies boys were the inspiration for the author and playwright J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. A little later, novelist Graham Greene was born in Berkhamsted and educated at Berkhamsted School, alongside literary contemporaries Claud Cockburn, Peter Quennell, Humphrey Trevelyan and Cecil Parrott. Children's authors H. E. Todd and Hilda van Stockum both lived in Berkhamsted.

In 1954, a delegation of the British Labour Party (including former Prime Minister Clement Attlee and former Secretary of State for Health Aneurin Bevan) was in Moscow. Sir William Goodenough Hayter, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, asked for a meeting with Nikita Khrushchev, then General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.OBITUARIES Sir William Hayter \u2013 People, News. The Independent. 30 March 1999. Much to Hayter's surprise, not only did Khrushchev accept the proposal, but he decided to attend in the company of Vyacheslav Molotov, Anastas Mikoyan, Andrey Vyshinsky, Nikolay Shvernik, and Malenkov. Such was the interest aroused in British political circles by this event that Sir Winston Churchill subsequently invited Sir William Hayter down to Chartwell so as to provide a full account of what had transpired at the meeting. Malenkov seemed \"easily the most intelligent and quickest to grasp what was being said\" and said \"no more than he wanted to say\". He was considered an \"extremely agreeable neighbour at the table\" and was thought to have had a \"pleasant, musical voice and spoke well-educated Russian\". Malenkov even recommended, quietly, that British diplomatic translator Cecil Parrott should read the novels of Leonid Andreyev, an author whose literature was at that time labeled as decadent in the USSR. Nikita Khrushchev, by contrast, struck Hayter as being \"rumbustious, impetuous, loquacious, free-wheeling, and alarmingly ignorant of foreign affairs\". Hayter thought that Khrushchev seemed \"incapable of grasping Bevan's line of thought\", and that Malenkov had to explain matters to him in \"words of one syllable\". Convinced that Malenkov was in charge, nobody in the British delegation felt much inclined to expend effort with Khrushchev. Malenkov \"spoke the best Russian of any Soviet leader I have heard\", his \"speeches were well constructed and logical in their development\", and he seemed \"a man with a more Western-orientated mind.\""]}, {"page": "The Bad Bohemian", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cecil Parrott"]}, {"page": "Jasper Parrott", "response": ["Jasper Parrott was educated at Tonbridge School in Kent and at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he read history.
