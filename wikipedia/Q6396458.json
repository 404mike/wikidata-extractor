The group consists of Daniel Ash (guitar, saxophone), Peter Murphy (vocals, occasional instruments), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass). The band was originally named Bauhaus 1919 in reference to the first operating year of the German art school Bauhaus, although they shortened the name within a year of formation. One of the pioneers of gothic rock, Bauhaus were known for their dark image and gloomy sound, although they mixed many genres, including dub, glam rock, psychedelia, and funk. ", "Ash's old bandmate Kevin Haskins joined as the drummer. Ash made a point of not inviting David J, the driving force in their previous bands, because he wanted a band he could control. Instead, Chris Barber was brought in to play bass, and together the four musicians formed the band S.R. However, within a few weeks Ash relented, and replaced Barber with David J, who suggested the new name Bauhaus 1919. David J. had already agreed to tour American airbases with another band, but decided that joining his friends' group was \"the right thing to do\". With their lineup complete, the band played their first gig at the Cromwell pub in Wellingborough on New Year's Eve 1978.", "After Bauhaus disbanded, the members of the band moved on to various solo work. Murphy worked briefly with bassist Mick Karn of Japan in the band Dalis Car, before going solo with such albums as 1986's Should the World Fail to Fall Apart, 1988's Love Hysteria and 1989's Deep. Ash had already started Tones on Tail with Bauhaus roadie Glen Campling as a side project in 1982; after Bauhaus broke up, Kevin Haskins joined the group, and the trio released an album and several EPs before breaking up after a 1984 American tour. During this time, David J released two solo albums and collaborated with other musicians, recording two albums with the Jazz Butcher, and also with comics writer/spoken-word artist Alan Moore in the short-lived band the Sinister Ducks.", "In 2008, Bauhaus released their first new studio album since 1983, Go Away White (Cooking Vinyl). It marked the band's end and the album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said \"We were getting along really well, but there was an incident that occurred,\" and added that as a result, \"Some of us just felt that we didn't want to carry on as a working unit.\" In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he \"was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable\", but in the end, \"that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really\". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: \"You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer\".", "In 2017, Ash and Kevin Haskins toured as Poptone with Haskins' daughter Diva Dompe on bass. The group performed songs from Bauhaus, Tones on Tail, and Love and Rockets along with cover songs. A live album recorded at various stops on the tour was released through PledgeMusic.", "Bauhaus are frequently considered to be the inventors of goth; however the band rejected this label, preferring to describe their style as \"dark glam.\" Peter Murphy said he felt their contemporaries had a larger hand in solidifying what became goth.{{cite web [first=Julian |last=Marszalek|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06637-peter-murphy-bauhaus-interview |title=Peter Murphy Interviewed|website=The Quietus|date=26 July 2011 |access-date=27 November 2015|quote=We were more aligned to The Clash than anything else that was going around. The Cure and those people really solidified what became goth, I suppose.}} Likewise, Kevin Haskins felt that bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees were more influential to goth subculture than themselves and mentioned that Bauhaus were \"...more three dimensional, more art rock\". Ash nevertheless admitted: \"if you wear black and your first single is \"Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead,\" you\u2019ve pretty much got a stamp on you.
