In 2014-15, Hughes claimed to have completed 53 marathons in 53 days, after which she claimed to have broken the Guinness World Record. However, her record claim was rejected by the organisation, as their requirements at the time asked for claimants to have run the marathons in official races. In 2017, Hughes claimed to have broken the 7 day treadmill world record, by running 521 miles (838 km) over seven days at the Trafford Centre. Her record claim was rejected as implausible for a non-elite runner, and it also lacked independent verification.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oswestry", "response": ["* Amy Hughes (born 1987) marathon runner,  BBC News, 27 September 2014, Amy Hughes completes......
