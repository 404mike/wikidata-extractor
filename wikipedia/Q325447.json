Wolves tore into Fulham from the off, with Dave Edwards flashing an early shot across goal and wide and Jesse Joronen having to charge out of his goal to save at the feet of Rajiv van la Parra. But on 15 minutes, Scott Golbourne's low corner was dummied by Edwards and allowed to run all the way to Bakary Sako, who drilled it into the bottom corner, with Mark Fotheringham wandering off the post which he was marking. Fulham tried to respond and Kostas Stafylidis fired narrowly over and then put in a dangerous cross which Tim Hoogland could not get a clean header on. But they almost found themselves two down before the interval when Wolves skipper Danny Batth got his head to Sako's free-kick only to nod the ball inches wide. Magath's response was to throw on another youngster, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and the 18-year-old almost made an instant impact with a low shot which Carl Ikeme tipped around his post. But with Ross McCormack again isolated up front - the \u00a311,000,000 striker resorted to coming back and collecting the ball from his centre-halves during the second half - Fulham rarely threatened an equaliser. The Scot's one sight of goal arrived just before the hour mark and his drive from the edge of the area was always rising as it cleared Ikeme's crossbar. Instead it was Wolves who always looked like adding to their tally, with Matt Doherty and Batth both missing the target with close-range headers before Sako blew their best chance in stoppage time, hitting the post with a penalty after Cameron Burgess tripped Nouha Dicko. Throughout the second half and after the full-time whistle, \"Felix out\" could be heard amongst the Fulham fans, and Magath did not acknowledge the fans when walking off, as Fulham slipped into the bottom three.", "In a bid to arrest his side's slump, Magath made five changes to his Fulham starting XI, with Kostas Stafylidis, Shaun Hutchinson, Mark Fotheringham and Hugo Rodallega all returning, while Fernando Amorebieta was handed his first outing of the campaign. The resulting formation caused the commentator on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra to announce that Fulham had so many centre backs he had no idea of the formation: Fulham played six defenders in a 6\u20131\u20131\u20131\u20131 formation. Despite a bright early start, it took just nine minutes for Fulham to get that familiar sinking feeling as Forest took the lead with their first attack of the game. Antonio was upended by Nikolay Bodurov and, from Henri Lansbury's whipped-in free-kick, Britt Assombalonga rose to head powerfully past G\u00e1bor Kir\u00e1ly. Assombalonga increased Fulham's woes from the penalty spot after 20 minutes. Antonio's brilliant run into the visitors' area was crudely halted by Hutchinson, who was duly booked \u2013 as was Dan Burn, who manhandled referee Darren Deadman \u2013 and Assombalonga fired his kick into the bottom corner. The Fulham manager sat motionless by the dugout as chants of \"Felix out\" rang out from the small pocket of Cottagers supporters situated behind Kir\u00e1ly's goal. But just past the hour mark, Jack Hunt's foul on Stafylidis presented \u00a311 million-man McCormack with a free shot on goal, and he hauled Fulham back into the match by delivering a stunning set-piece past the despairing dive of Darlow for his first league goal for the Cottagers. Rodallega should have levelled as he latched on to a through ball, but as he rounded Darlow and shot goalwards, a defender rushed back to clear off the line. Bodurov fired over when unmarked in the Forest box as Fulham came out with renewed vigour, and their early energy was rewarded when Amorebieta's cross was smartly diverted home by Rodallega. Amazingly, Fulham grabbed the lead after 64 minutes, with McCormack firing the Londoners ahead following a three-man move between himself, Rodallega and substitute Chris David. But Forest awoke from their slumber to restore parity after 77 minutes as Antonio latched on to a brilliant pass from skipper Michael Mancienne to crack home a shot into the corner. And after looking almost dead and buried, Forest suddenly found themselves ahead two minutes later when Assombalonga's header hit a post, but he reacted quickest to stab the ball home. Forest then sealed victory in the 89th minute when Paterson ran through on goal to calmly dispatch the ball past Kiraly from 15 yards.", "|  Mark Fotheringham", "|  Mark Fotheringham"]}, {"page": "Mark Fotheringham", "response": ["Mark Fotheringham may refer to:", "* Mark Fotheringham (Australian footballer) (born 1957), former Australian rules footballer with Yarraville and Williamstown", "* Mark Fotheringham (Scottish footballer) (born 1983), Scottish association footballer, currently a free agent"]}]}}
