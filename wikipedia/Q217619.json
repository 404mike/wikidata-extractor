In 1971, it was adapted into a controversial film by Stanley Kubrick, which Burgess said was chiefly responsible for the popularity of the book. Burgess produced numerous other novels, including the Enderby quartet, and Earthly Powers. He wrote librettos and screenplays, including the 1977 TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth. He worked as a literary critic for several publications, including The Observer and The Guardian, and wrote studies of classic writers, notably James Joyce. A versatile linguist, Burgess lectured in phonetics, and translated Cyrano de Bergerac, Oedipus Rex, and the opera Carmen, among others.\nBurgess also composed over 250 musical works; he considered himself as much a composer as an author, although he achieved considerably more success in writing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Clockwork Orange (novel)", "response": ["A Clockwork Orange is a dystopian satirical black comedy novel by English writer Anthony Burgess, published in 1962.

Kubrick had received a copy of Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name from Terry Southern while they were working on Dr. Strangelove, but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat, a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. The decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth reflected contemporary concerns in 1969; the New Hollywood movement was creating a great number of films that depicted the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people. A Clockwork Orange was shot over 1970\u20131971 on a budget of \u00a32 million. Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in filming, deciding that the 1.66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an \"acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy\", and favored his \"rigorously symmetrical framing\", which \"increased the beauty of his compositions\". The film heavily features \"pop erotica\" of the period, including a giant white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a \"slightly futuristic\" look.

Nevertheless, the novel was reassembled and published, still without a straight linear form, but with fewer breaks in the story. The trilogy featured time-travel adventures in which Burroughs' narrators rewrote episodes from history to reform mankind. Reviews were mixed for Cities.
