Stevenage had taken the lead after just seven minutes, a Brett Johnson clearance hit the legs of Lawrie Wilson and deflected past AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper Jack Turner. The home side turned the game around shortly after the interval, scoring twice in the space of four second-half minutes. Former Stevenage player Sam Hatton restored parity from the penalty spot after Darius Charles had fouled Ryan Jackson, before Rashid Yussuff beat Alan Julian with a tidy finish. Stevenage captain Mark Roberts' 20-yard injury-time volley meant that the tie went to penalties, with AFC Wimbledon progressing to the Third Round after Wilson missed the final spot-kick."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["On 1 January 2012, Marcus Williams left the club on a free transfer to join Sheffield United. The next day Reading suffered their first defeat in four games away at Cardiff City, losing 3\u20131. All the goals came in the first half with Cardiff taking a 3\u20130 lead through Joe Mason, Aron Gunnarsson and Kenny Miller, before Jobi McAnuff scored Reading solitary goal on half time. On 7 January 2012, Reading were knocked out of the F.A. Cup by League One side Stevenage, after losing 1\u20130 at home to a Darius Charles goal in the 20th minute. On 9 January 2012, it was announced that Alex McCarthy had signed a contract extension until 2015, and also gone out on loan to Ipswich Town for three months. On 12 January 2012 Reading announced the signing of Republic of Ireland U21 international Karl Sheppard from Shamrock Rovers on a free transfer. Reading returned to winning form on 14 January away at Watford. Watford took the lead through a Shaun Cummings own goal after 29 minutes, but Jimmy Kebe fired home the equaliser on 42 to see the sides in level at half time. Reading's winner was thanks to substitute Adam Le Fondre who netted with 5 minutes remaining to give Reading all the points. On 20 January, Reading announced that Russian investment group, Thames Sports Investment, had agreed a deal with Sir John Madejski to buy a significant holding in Reading FC. The deal see Madejski stay on as chairman until 2014, and provide Brian McDermott and Nick Hammond with funds to spend during the January transfer window. 21 January saw Reading lose at home to another promotion contender, Hull City when Robbie Brady scored the only goal of the game after 66 minutes.

With Wednesday yet to gain any points away from home this season, The Owls were happy with the eventual outcome of a 1\u20131 draw. Bradley Wright-Phillips scored from outside the box into the low corner in just the third minute, but Clinton Morrison earned the point when he equalised in the second half, three-minutes after coming on in the fifty-third minute. In the course of this game, Ryan Lowe made his debut for the club when coming off the bench, but then had to be replaced after an injury. Ryan Lowe did however win the League One Player of the Month award four days later, after scoring seven goals in the opening month of the season for his previous side Bury. The first home game of the month saw another tough opponent of Milton Keynes Dons who held first place in the league. After a poor performance in the first half, the game was goalless and Jermaine Johnson was replaced, as he had only been back in training after injury days earlier. Things changed in the second half with Gary Madine scoring twice in ten minutes, before Angelo Balanta pulled one back for Milton Keynes Dons. With Milton Keynes Dons pushing forward in the later stages of the game, Wednesday hit them on the counter-attack with 19-year-old Scotland U-21 international Liam Palmer scoring his first goal for the club. On 12 September The Owls were sad to hear that Wednesday-supporter and goalkeeper Nicky Weaver was to be 'sidelined for three months', due to an ongoing problem with the cartilage in his knee. This meant second-choice goalkeeper was expected to have an opportunity to impress in several matches on the bounce for Wednesday. His first appearance with the absence of Nicky Weaver however was one to forget. In the mid-week match away to Stevenage The Owls lost 5\u20131, after four goals in the first half from Craig Reid, John Mousinho, Michael Bostwick, and Lawrie Wilson. Then another to make it five in the second-half by Darius Charles, before Gary Madine scored nothing but a consolation goal in the seventy-fourth minute. Wednesday included their first sending-off of the campaign to make matters worse in the later stages of the game when Jermaine Johnson was sent-off for an off-the-ball incident. After this terrible defeat, Gary Megson felt the squad still needed some improvement, especially with the club having several injuries, including striker Ryan Lowe. Midway through the month David McGoldrick was brought in on a one-month loan, as the emergency-loan window was still open for football league clubs below the Barclays Premier League. David McGoldrick made his debut for Sheffield Wednesday that weekend, in which he started the game away to Yeovil Town. Ten-minutes into the game David McGoldrick scored on his debut to give Wednesday the lead. However, Yeovil Town striker Kieran Agard hit two goals before half-time and The Owls found themselves behind. Having been humiliated the previous away game, Wednesday went out in the second-half hoping to finish the game with a win. Wednesday did exactly that with goals from defender Julian Bennett on the fifty-first minute and twenty-minutes later top scorer Gary Madine scored the winning goal with the game finishing 2\u20133. Although manager Gary Megson felt goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell was up to the job at first, due to first-choice keeper Nicky Weaver out for three-months, Megson did bring in Stephen Bywater on loan from Derby County for three-months, as The Owls had let in seven goals in two games. With new signing Chris O'Grady coming back from injury that week, and Ryan Lowe soon to be back, striker Clinton Morrison was sent out on loan to Milton Keynes Dons for one-month on an emergency loan deal. The Owls back at home on 24 September they played Exeter City, James O'Connor scored the opener, and a double-brace from Gary Madine, including one from the penalty-spot, made the game finish 3\u20130."]}, {"page": "Chuks Aneke", "response": ["Aneke joined League One club Stevenage on 22 November, on loan until 22 January 2012. He made his debut four days later, playing 57 minutes of a goalless draw at home to Walsall before being replaced by Darius Charles. Aneke was sent off for a high-footed challenge in a 1\u20130 defeat to Leyton Orient on 2 January 2012, resulting in a three-game suspension. It was later announced that Aneke would remain on loan at Stevenage until March, with a view to extending the loan until the end of the 2011\u201312 season."]}]}}
