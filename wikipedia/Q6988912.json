It attempted to rejoin the TUC in 1913, but was blocked by other unions which claimed that it was poaching their members.  The union was a founder member of the Labour Representation Committee, and remained affiliated as it became the Labour Party.  Despite its original aim of sponsoring labour candidates, it was unable to do so until 1918.  However, Duncan managed to gain the sponsorship of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and served as an MP from 1906 onwards.  The union's leadership supported World War I, with both Beard and Duncan joining the British Workers' League, although they left in 1918 when it supported anti-Labour Party Parliamentary candidates.  Duncan and Morley stood for the Labour Party in the 1918 UK general election, but both were unsuccessful.  Neil Maclean, a union member, did win a seat with the backing of the Independent Labour Party, and in 1919 he was elected to the union's executive."]}, {"page": "Neil McLean", "response": ["* Neil Maclean (1875\u20131953), Scottish socialist and MP for Glasgow Govan"]}, {"page": "Neil MacLean", "response": ["#REDIRECT Neil Maclean "]}, {"page": "Neil Maclean (politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Neil Maclean"]}, {"page": "National Administrative Council", "response": ["|rowspan=4| Neil Maclean"]}]}}
