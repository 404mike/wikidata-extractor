He has played in the Football League for Wrexham.\nMackin started his career with Wrexham in their youth system, before making his first-team debut on the last day of the 2003\u201304 season. He made 11 appearances the following season and he signed his first professional contract in 2005. He established himself in the team in 2005\u201306, having made 19 appearances. However, next season, appearances became rarer and in 2008 he was loaned to Conference Premier club Droylsden. After being recalled by Wrexham, he scored in their final match in the Football League before relegation to the Conference Premier. He joined York City on loan in 2009 and played for them in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. After being released by Wrexham he signed for York permanently and played in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. He was released by York in 2011 before having spells with Alfreton Town, Chester, Bangor City, Conwy Borough and Rhyl.\nMackin represented Wales at international level. He was on the substitutes' bench twice for the under-17 team, before making an appearance in 2002. He received call ups to the under-19 team but did not make any appearances. Having received his first call up for the under-21 team in 2005, he made his first and only appearance against Northern Ireland in 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Chester", "response": ["*Levi Mackin, footballer"]}, {"page": "Peter Till", "response": ["Till signed a one-year contract with Conference Premier club York City on 29 June 2010 and following the move he said \"I spoke to a number of clubs but this felt right.

Their start to the season justified those predictions, as they won their first seven matches, a club record for Chester FC and also surpassing Chester City's best start to the season. Included in that run were victories over pre-season favourites F.C. Halifax Town and a 4\u20130 drubbing of previously unbeaten Guiseley. Despite this, the club only sat in second place in the division, as Brackley Town also won each of their first seven games. The run came to an end with a 3\u20132 defeat at Boston United in Chester's eighth match. After two more victories, against Stalybridge Celtic and Bishop's Stortford, Chester went to the top of the table for the first time due to a 1\u20131 draw with Bradford Park Avenue. Following this draw, Chester then went on a run of twelve consecutive league victories, including a 3\u20132 win at Brackley. This run came to an end with a goalless draw, again against Bradford PA on 5 January, which was also the first league match of the season in which Chester failed to score. Chester were promoted to the Conference Premier following their 1\u20130 win at home to Boston United. In the FA Cup, Chester FC's first ever match was a 1\u20131 draw away at Gainsborough Trinity in the second qualifying round. Chester won the replay at the Exacta Stadium 2\u20131 with goals from Dominic Collins and Levi Mackin. Chester's third qualifying round tie, at home to FC Halifax Town, was marred by crowd trouble, and finished in a 1\u20131 draw. Chester exited the FA Cup following a 3\u20131 win by Halifax at The Shay in the replay. The FA Trophy proved less successful for Chester than in the previous season, as the Blues failed to win a single match, exiting in a replay at Worksop Town. On 6 April 2013, Chester were confirmed as champions of the Conference North, beating Boston United 1\u20130 at the Exacta through a Lewis Turner header, winning a third successive title, and in doing so, becoming the first club in English football history to achieve three successive promotions. Three promotions in their first three years means that Chester will play their next season's football in the Conference Premier, the level from which their predecessors Chester City were expelled in 2010. Chester set several league records for the Conference North in this prolific season: most wins (34), fewest defeats (3), most points (107), most goals scored (103), best goal difference (+71) and also the longest unbeaten streak (30 games)."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 York City F.C. season", "response": ["Richard Brodie, Andy McWilliams, Josh Mimms and Ben Purkiss signed new contracts with York. 11 players joined before the season kicked off; defenders James Meredith from Shrewsbury Town, Alan O'Hare from Mansfield Town and Djoumin Sangar\u00e9 from Salisbury City, midfielders Neil Barrett from Ebbsfleet United, Andy Ferrell from Kidderminster Harriers, Alex Lawless from Forest Green Rovers, Levi Mackin from Wrexham, winger Craig Nelthorpe from Oxford United, and strikers Michael Gash from Ebbsfleet, Richard Pacquette from Maidenhead United and Michael Rankine from Rushden.
