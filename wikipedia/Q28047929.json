The band achieved promotion to Grade 2 under the Newell's leadership, but in the middle of 1981 Newell left after a disagreement and Richard Parkes became pipe major. Field Marshal was promoted to Grade 1 at the end of 1985, won its first Grade 1 Major Championship at Cowal in 1990, won its first World Championship in 1992, and then won every Major Championship in 1993.", "From 2010 to 2009, the band won 28 major championships, including four World Championships and five runners-up awards.
