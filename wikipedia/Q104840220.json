He came from a well-off background and chose to play as an amateur for much of his career, a freedom which allowed him to join the Pilgrims exhibition team which toured North America in the autumn of 1909 before going back to Falkirk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Davidson", "response": ["William Davidson or Bill Davidson may refer to:", "** William Davidson Institute, University of Michigan, named in honor of Bill Davidson", "* William Davidson (lumberman) (1740\u20131790), Scots-Canadian pioneer", "* Sir William Davidson of Curriehill (1614/15\u2013c. 1689), Scottish merchant and member of the Privy council", "* William Davidson (congressman) (1778\u20131857), member of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina", "* William Davidson (Pennsylvania representative) (1783\u20131867), Pennsylvania politician", "* William Davidson (conspirator) (1781\u20131820), Jamaican-born British radical executed for his part in the Cato Street Conspiracy", "* William Davidson (British Columbia politician) (fl. 1867\u20131907), Scottish-born miner and political figure in British Columbia", "* William Davidson (engineer) (1844\u20131920), Australian civil engineer", "* William Davidson Bissett (1893\u20131971), Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* William Davidson (sailor) (1876\u20131939), British competition sailor", "* William Davidson (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1904-1914), Scottish footballer with Falkirk, Everton, etc", "* William Davidson (Sussex cricketer) (1920\u20132015), English cricketer", "* William Davidson (MCC cricketer) (1811\u20131894), English cricketer", "* William Davidson (bishop) (1919\u20132006), bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western Kansas", "* William Davidson (filmmaker) (1928\u20132009), Canadian filmmaker and TV creator", "* William Davidson (landscape gardener) fl 1860s"]}, {"page": "List of Queen's Park F.C. seasons", "response": ["William Davidson", "|William Davidson"]}]}}
