He played Junior football for Pollok before signing for \"A\" Division club Third Lanark. He made no first-team appearances before his career was interrupted by National Service commitments with the RAF. In the later part of 1952, he was stationed at RAF Middleton St George, in the north east of England, and Third Lanark allowed him to play for Darlington of the English Third Division North when available to do so. He appeared for Darlington's reserves in the North-Eastern League, as well as in Services football, before making his senior debut in the Third Division on 20 December, replacing Ken Murray at inside left for a 3\u20130 defeat away to Southport. Later in the season, he had a run of games, also in place of Murray, and took his total to ten by the end of the season. He scored twice, at home to Accrington Stanley in March and Stockport County in April; on each occasion it was the only goal of the match."]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ken Murray"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ken Murray"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ken Murray"]}, {"page": "1956\u201357 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ken Murray"]}]}}
