At the age of thirteen he successfully claimed the estate of his distant cousin Sir Frank Standish, Bt., (as the great grandson of Margaret Standish, Sir Frank's aunt), which included the manor of Duxbury and Duxbury Hall near Chorley, Lancashire. He attained the right to bear his benefactor's surname and arms, but failed in his attempts to succeed to the baronetcy which was extinguished.\nDuring his adult years Standish travelled extensively on the continent, spending much of his very substantial income on the purchase of art works and books. He lived chiefly in Seville. He published a number of long poems, and books of travel and topography\nFrank Hall Standish died in 1840 at Cadiz, unmarried and probably without issue, and was buried in the Standish crypt at St Laurence's, Chorley. The manor of Duxbury and the estates passed to his second cousin, William Standish Carr.\n\"Piqued at the English ministry's refusal to revive the baronetcy\", however, or \"as a mark of respect to the French\"  he gave his book and art collections to the French king Louis Philippe. Until the revolution of 1848, the art works were displayed in the Standish gallery in the Louvre. Subsequently, Louis Philippe reclaimed them as his private property and the whole was sold in 1852\u20133, the drawings, etc., in Paris and the paintings in London. The books passed to his son, Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc d'Aumale and formed part of the collection which he bequeathed to the Institut de France along with the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly. They are still held there in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duxbury Hall", "response": ["After the death of Sir Frank Standish, Bt (MP for Preston in 1768) in 1812, the estate was claimed on behalf of Frank Hall Standish on the grounds that he was the great grandson of Margaret Standish, Sir Frank\u2019s aunt and the house occupied by his, guardian, George Baker.
