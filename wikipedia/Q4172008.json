The silent older man who stalks the action in the first two acts is revealed to be Theseus (Paul Whelan); reviewers have suggested that in this staging Theseus himself was once the object of Oberon's attentions, and is either watching history repeating itself, or is in fact daydreaming the magical events of the opera prior to his marriage to Hippolyta."]}, {"page": "Wigmore Hall", "response": ["Peter Schreier, Janet Baker and Margaret Price performed regularly at the Hall, and in recent years Wigmore has produced recitals featuring Thomas Quasthoff, Ian Bostridge, Susan Graham, Mark Padmore, Sir Thomas Allen, Matthias Goerne, Dame Felicity Lott, Angelika Kirchschlager, Simon Keenlyside, Anne Sofie von Otter, Wolfgang Holzmair, Christopher Maltman, Andreas Scholl, and Soile Isokoski.

Stephen Pritchard of The Guardian observed, \"MacMillan writes melismatic, quasi-oriental vocal lines that work hypnotically when assigned to soloists, but less so when sung by large forces. Several moments of imprecision crept into the spinning descent of the Kyrie, for instance. Baritone Jacques Imbrailo was implacable in the Domine Jesu Christe and countertenor Iestyn Davies plangent in the beautiful Lux aeterna, but there was precious little music of consolation in this bleak requiem. The stock-still calm of the Agnus Dei allowed a moment of reflection, but the closing chorus offered only a cold, diminishing drumbeat towards oblivion. Rather like the Remain view of Brexit.\" Alexandra Coghlan of i similarly reflected, \"This is a Requiem for our troubled times, a lament for the cultural idea of Europe, rather than the continent itself. We have no right to ask for something sweeter, though it would be nice if future performances gave us a chorus less timid and beat-shy, capable of finding the shock and awe as well as the sadness in this major new work.\"", "Richard Fairman of the Financial Times was more critical of the work, writing, \"Over 40 minutes it sets some, though not all, of the familiar text of the Requiem Mass. Even that, however, starts to seem too much. Typically bold MacMillan ideas come and go at speed, impatiently punctuating what should be a sustained atmosphere.\"  He added, \"The music was at its most persuasive when it settles down. A haunting 'Kyrie eleison', beautifully sung by countertenor Iestyn Davies, established a memorably lamenting tone. A softly murmured choral 'Agnus Dei' held time still. The closing 'In paradisum', inflected by plainchant, faded out in an orchestral shimmer. Like too much else, that was gone before it could make its effect.\" However, Damian Thompson of The Spectator described it as \"a piece of gloriously subversive new music.\""]}, {"page": "La Nuova Musica", "response": ["* Gluck: Orfeo ed Euridice, Wq. 30 [Live] (2019) with countertenor Iestyn Davies", "* Handel's Unsung Heroes (2021), with soprano Lucy Crowe and countertenor Iestyn Davies"]}]}}
