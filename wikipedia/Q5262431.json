He was the joint International Coordinator for the Green Party and stood against Prime Minister Theresa May as the Maidenhead Green candidate in the 2017 general election. Formerly the party's Principal Speaker, he is known as a prominent eco-socialist, campaigning both for environmentalism and socialism. Alongside his political role, Wall is an academic and a writer, having published on the subject of ecosocialism and the wider Green politics movement. He is a contributor to the Morning Star newspaper and a blogger.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Left-wing politics", "response": ["Several left-wing or socialist groupings have an overt environmental concern and several green parties contain a strong socialist presence. The Green Party of England and Wales features an eco-socialist group, the Green Left, which was founded in June 2005. Its members held several influential positions within the party, including both the former Principal Speakers Si\u00e2n Berry and Derek Wall, himself an eco-socialist and Marxist academic. In Europe, several green left political parties such as the European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left combine traditional social-democratic values such as a desire for greater economic equality and workers rights with demands for environmental protection. Democratic socialist Bolivian president Evo Morales has traced environmental degradation to capitalist consumerism, stating that \"[t]he Earth does not have enough for the North to live better and better, but it does have enough for all of us to live well\". James Hansen, Noam Chomsky, Raj Patel, Naomi Klein, The Yes Men and Dennis Kucinich hold similar views."]}, {"page": "William Morris", "response": ["Politically, Morris was a staunch revolutionary socialist and anti-imperialist, and although raised a Christian he came to be an atheist. He came to reject state socialism and large centralised control, instead emphasising localised administration within a socialist society. Later political activist Derek Wall suggested that Morris could be classified as an ecosocialist. Morris was greatly influenced by Romanticism, with Thompson asserting that Romanticism was \"bred into his bones, and formed his early consciousness.\" Thompson argued that this \"Romantic Revolt\" was part of a \"passionate protest against an intolerable social reality\", that of the industrial capitalism of Britain's Victorian era. He believed that it led to little more than a \"yearning nostalgia or a sweet complaint\" and that Morris only became \"a realist and a revolutionary\" when he adopted socialism in 1882. Mackail was of the opinion that Morris had an \"innate Socialism\" which had \"penetrated and dominated all he did\" throughout his life. Given the conflict between his personal and professional life and his socio-political views, MacCarthy described Morris as \"a conservative radical\"."]}, {"page": "Green politics", "response": ["The first political party to be created with its basis in environmental issues was the United Tasmania Group, founded in Australia in March 1972 to fight against deforestation and the creation of a dam that would damage Lake Pedder; whilst it only gained three percent in state elections, it had, according to Derek Wall, \"inspired the creation of Green parties all over the world.\"Wall 2010. p. 14.

Some members, like Matt Sellwood, while in favour of a Leader system in principle, were opposed to the current referendum because the term of reelection would be extended to two years.", "Derek Wall countered pro-leader arguments by stating that \"if you are a clear speaker, there's no problem getting coverage and explaining the party's views.\" He was concerned by the history of past political parties that started off as being participatory until they adopted a single leader system in which the members became \"puppets\".

In Wall's eyes, the party suffered from a lack of media attention and \"opposition from many environmentalists\", which contrasted with the experience of other emerging Green parties, such as Germany's Die Gr\u00fcnen. Nonetheless, PEOPLE invested many of its resources in engaging with the indifferent environmental movement, which Wall calls a \"tactical mistake\".", "Party co-founder Tony Whittaker noted in an interview with Derek Wall \"\u2026 voters did not connect PEOPLE with ecology. What I wanted was something that the media could look up in their files so that, when they wanted a spokesman of the issue of ecology, they could find the Ecology Party and pick up the phone. It was as brutal and basic as that. PEOPLE didn\u2019t communicate what we had hoped it would communicate\".", "With Porritt gaining increasing prominence and an election manifesto called The Real Alternative, the Ecology Party fielded 53 candidates in the 1979 general election, entitling them to radio and television election broadcasts. Though many considered this a gamble, the plan, encouraged by Porritt, worked, as the party received 39,918 votes (an average of 1.5%) and membership jumped tenfold from around 500 to 5,000 or more. This, Derek Wall notes, meant that the Ecology Party \"became the fourth party in UK politics, ahead of the National Front and Socialist Unity\".", "The next year, an internal dispute arose within the party. A faction calling itself the Party Organisation Working Group (POWG) proposed constitutional amendments designed to create a streamlined, two-tier structure to govern the internal workings of the party. Decentralists voted these proposals down. Paul Ekins and Jonathan Tyler, prominent party activists and leading members of POWG, then formed a semi-covert group called Maingreen, whose private comments, upon becoming public knowledge, suggested to many that they wished to take control of the party. Tyler and Ekins resigned and left the party but Derek Wall describes how the \"wounds\" left by the 'Maingreen Affair' lingered on in the heated internal debates of the late 1980s.", "According to Derek Wall, the party would have gained 12 seats if they had been running in other European countries who employed Proportional Representation. Wall explains this \"breakthrough\" as a combination of the declining popularity of Margaret Thatcher, the reaction to the Poll Tax, Conservative opposition to the European Union, ineffective Labour Party and Liberal Democrat campaigns and a well-prepared Green Party campaign. That environmental issues were very prominent in UK politics at the time should also be added to this list. At no time before or since have Green issues been so high on the minds of UK voters as a voting issue.", "As a result of this success, Sara Parkin and David Icke rose to prominence in the UK media, soon becoming two of the four Principal Speakers, a position created in lieu of a leader. Parkin especially was in demand as a Green spokesperson. However, the new media attention was not always handled well by the party as a whole. In the run up to the 1989 party conference, it attracted criticism for advocating policies aiming to reduce the total population, proposals which were subsequently rejected. Further controversies included Derek Wall's rejection of possible alliances to establish PR. Icke too attracted criticism soon after writing his second book in 1989, an outline of his views on the environment."]}, {"page": "Keith Taylor (British politician)", "response": ["In August 2004, Taylor was appointed as a replacement for Mike Woodin as the Green Party's Male Principal Speaker alongside Caroline Lucas.
