By the time he was 18, Daniel was a regular in the Llanelli first team, and it wasn't long before he was promoted to the Scarlets regional side. He made his debut for the Scarlets on 20 August 2005 in a friendly match against the Worcester Warriors, but didn't score his first try until the following match, another friendly against a Scarlets Regional Select XV four days later.\nDaniel spent most of the 2005\u201306 season playing for Llanelli in the Principality Premiership, but also played five matches for the Scarlets, scoring one try. In the 2006\u201307 Magners League, however, Daniel became much more of a fixture in the Scarlets squad, playing 21 matches and scoring 10 tries, including a hat\u2013trick in the win over the Glasgow Warriors. Nathan Brew's arrival at the West Wales club made it more difficult for Daniel to hold down a spot in the Scarlets' starting XV in the 2007\u201308 Magners League, but Mark Jones absence at the 2007 Rugby World Cup provided him with a chance to prove himself before the competition for places intensified.\nIn July 2010, Daniel was released by the Scarlets, and soon signed with the Carmarthen Quins. He later joined London Irish playing for the A side. and in 2011 joined the Cornish Pirates where he stayed for one season starting two games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burry Port", "response": ["*Darren Daniel (born 1986), rugby player"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Celtic League", "response": ["|  Darren Daniel"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Llanelli Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Darren Daniel"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Scarlets season", "response": ["The Scarlets opened their 2008-09 Celtic League season away to Ulster on 5 September 2008. Despite playing against the wind in the first half, the Scarlets scored an early penalty in the sixth minute, before Darren Daniel scored the first try of the game, crossing in the corner. Clinton Schifcofske scored three penalties in response to make the half-time score 10\u20139 to the visitors. The Scarlets then took full advantage of the wind in the second half, Stephen Jones putting over two penalties to put the result beyond doubt. The Scarlets' next match came five days later, when they travelled to Rodney Parade to take on the Newport Gwent Dragons. The game looked out of the Llanelli side's reach at half time, as they trailed 25\u20136, but two unanswered tries from Martin Roberts and Nathan Brew, a conversion and two further penalties from Stephen Jones pulled the score back to 25\u201324. Brew came close to putting the Scarlets into the lead with 11 minutes to go, but fumbled the ball before he could get to the line, while Stephen Jones put an easy drop goal wide moments later. Fortunately for him, after Robert Lewis conceded a penalty in front of the posts, Jones finally gave the Scarlets a two-point win with three minutes left to play.", "|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Darren Daniel"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Darren Daniel"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Cornish Pirates RFC season", "response": ["* Darren Daniel (from  Carmarthen Quins) "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Scarlets season", "response": ["| 4 May 2011 BBC Sport - Cornish Pirates sign Welsh winger Darren Daniel", "|  Darren Daniel"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Darren Daniel"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Cornish Pirates RFC season", "response": ["* Darren Daniel (released from contract in March 2012)"]}]}}
