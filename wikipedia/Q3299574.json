Several of his fights were fought at Hightown Barracks or in the Poyser Street drill hall, Wrexham.

Basham was posted as sergeant physical training officer in the British Expeditionary Force in France, making competitive fighting difficult. Basham was one of a group of fighters, known as 'The Famous Six', who were an elite corps of Army Physical Training Instructors under the command of Captain Bruce Logan. The other five men were Jim Driscoll, Jimmy Wilde, Bombardier Billy Wells, Pat O'Keefe and Dick Smith.Lee (2009) pp. 68\u201369 At the London Opera House in March 1915, Basham won a 15-round fight \"on points\" against Matt Wells. In May 1915, Basham fought against Summers in a non-title fight at Liverpool Stadium. The fight went the distance with Basham being given the decision on points. In May 1915 the National Sporting Club arranged Basham's first defence of his welterweight title, his opponent being Tom McCormick who had held the title briefly in 1914. The twenty round fight lasted until the thirteenth when Basham stopped McMormick through a technical knockout. Basham knocked out Dan Roberts during the seventh round at a 13 August fight in Liverpool. On 22 October 1915, a fight was arranged for the vacant EBU (European) welterweight title between Basham and Swiss fighter Albert Badoud. Basham has fought Badoud twice previously, both ending in wins for the Welshman, but in the title encounter Badoud stopped Basham through a ninth-round knockout.", "In November 1919, a contest was arranged between Basham and Matt Wells, who had knocked Basham out when they met in Swansea in 1912. At stake were Basham's British Welterweight title and Wells' Commonwealth Welterweight title, which he had taken from Tom McCormick in an encounter in Sydney in 1914. Basham won the fight on points, making him the British, Commonwealth and European Welterweight Champion. He then successfully defended his Commonwealth belt from a challenge from Australian Welterweight champion Fred Kay, before facing former World Welterweight Champion Ted \"Kid\" Lewis on 9 June 1920. Lewis, who had three months prior taken the vacant British middleweight title, challenged for all three of Basham's belts, in a contest held at the Olympia in Kensington.

O'Neil suspended the club's license until improvements recommended by Fire Commissioner Joseph Johnson were made to Madison Square Garden. The commission eventually revoked the MSAC's license and another club, reported to be run by Frank J. Farrell and Tim Hurst with O'Neil as a partner, took over fight promotion at the Garden. Boxer Al Palzer and promoter Tom O'Rourke accused O'Neil of taking $800 in exchange for approving a fight between Palzer and Jack Johnson. O'Neil denied the allegation, stating that he would never allow Johnson to fight in New York. In 1912, Bat Masterson accused O'Neil of being biased against the National Sporting Club and referee Patsy Haley, being a silent partner of the Madison Square Garden Athletic Club, demanding an excessive of complementary tickets from promoters, and associating with known criminal Jimmy Kelly. Despite the accusations, O'Neil remained on the commission and in 1913 was elected chairman. On October 8, 1915, Governor Charles Seymour Whitman removed O'Neil from the board after the commission failed to renew the license of the Show Corporation, which caused the cancellation of a fight between Willie Ritchie and Johnny Dundee at Madison Square Garden. He was replaced by sportswriter Fred A. Wenck."]}]}}
