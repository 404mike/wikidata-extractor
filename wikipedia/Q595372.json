John made his Arsenal first-team debut on 28 October 1922 in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Newcastle United and quickly became a regular, succeeding Tom Whittaker at left half. His ability was such that soon after he made his debut for the Welsh national side, against Scotland on 17 March 1923; it was the first of fifteen caps.\nJohn was displaced from the Arsenal side in 1923\u201324 thanks to competition from Billy Blyth and Andrew Young, but after being switched to left back to cover for Andy Kennedy, he was a near ever-present in 1924\u201325. Eventually however, John was switched back to left half, and this time he remained a first-team regular. A prodigious ball-winner and noted passer of the ball, John reached (but lost) the FA Cup Final with Arsenal in 1926\u201327, after a mistake by his compatriot and close friend Dan Lewis; it was John who consoled Lewis after the final whistle, assuring him he would get another chance to a win a medal (although Lewis never did).  He played in Arsenal's 2\u20131 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930.John remained in the Arsenal side through the first half of the 1930s, despite competition from Charlie Jones. He finally won some silverware with an FA Cup win in 1929\u201330, followed by three First Division titles, in 1930\u201331, 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334. John also scored Arsenal's only goal of the 1932 FA Cup Final, in which Arsenal were controversially beaten by Newcastle United. By this time he was one of the senior members of the Arsenal squad, and mentored many of the club's younger new arrivals, such as Alex James.\nAlthough John played for Arsenal until his retirement in 1938, for the final three years of his career he was mainly a reserve player, having lost his place to Wilf Copping, and thus missed out on a medal in the Gunners' League win of 1934\u201335. Nevertheless, he played 470 times for the club in total, the most of any of Arsenal's pre-World War II players; as of 2006 he is tenth in the club's all-time appearances table.\nOn retiring in 1938, John joined the coaching staff at West Ham United. He later joined Torquay United as trainer, working under his former Highbury teammate Jack Butler, but when Butler left for Crystal Palace in May 1947, John followed, again as trainer. In 1949 he was appointed trainer-coach at Cardiff City, a position he held until March 1950 when he was appointed manager of Torquay United. He had an unsuccessful spell as manager at Plainmoor, winning only 7 of the 28 games he was in charge for and left his post in November 1950.\nHe finished his football career as a scout for Cardiff City. He died in Barry in 1982, at the age of 83. In 2008, his descendants loaned his shirts from the 1927, 1930 and 1932 FA Cup Finals to the Arsenal FC Museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["|1950||Bob John"]}, {"page": "Barry Town United F.C.", "response": ["|DF|| Bob John"]}, {"page": "Herbert Chapman", "response": ["Arsenal went on to finish second in 1925\u201326, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It proved to be an early dawn for Arsenal, who spent most of the rest of the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, outlining a five-year plan for success.Soar & Tyler, p. 48.

However, he could never knit together a solid winning side and Arsenal's performances gradually declined towards the end of his tenure; they finished 19th in 1923-24 and 20th in 1924-25."]}, {"page": "Percy Sands", "response": ["With the advent of World War I, first-class football was suspended, but despite his age (33), Sands continued to play for Arsenal in unofficial wartime matches. He later left to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps on the Western Front. After peace broke out, he joined Southern League side Southend United, before retiring. In all he played 350 matches for the Gunners, a record that stood until it was broken by Bob John fifteen years later."]}, {"page": "Wilf Copping", "response": ["Copping was signed by Arsenal in the summer of 1934 for \u00a38,000, as a replacement for Bob John, and immediately took a first-team place at left half. He made his debut against Portsmouth on 25 August 1934, and was an ever-present in his first season for the club, until suffering a serious knee injury in the third-last match of the season against Everton. Copping soldiered on and remained on the pitch to ensure Arsenal won the game 2\u20130; this ensured the club won the 1934-35 First Division title."]}, {"page": "George Male", "response": ["Born in West Ham, Essex, Male trialled with West Ham United before playing with non-league Clapton.

Initially a left-Winger or left-half, usually deputising for Bob John. Male's appearances were few and far between - three in 1930-31 (in which Arsenal won the First Division for the first time in their history) and nine in 1931-32, although he was a surprise choice at left half in the 1932 FA Cup final after Alex James was withdrawn because of injury and the side reshuffled as a result. Arsenal controversially lost 2\u20131 to Newcastle United, after Newcastle's equaliser had come after the ball had already gone behind for a goal kick."]}, {"page": "Charlie Jones (footballer, born 1899)", "response": ["However, Jones proved his versatility by moving to right half, and became known as a tenacious ballwinner and committed tackler in the Arsenal midfield. With Arsenal he won three First Division winners' medals (in 1930\u201331, 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334), and played in the 1931\u201332 FA Cup final (which Arsenal lost controversially to Newcastle United). Towards the end of his career his age was starting to catch up with him, and competition for midfield places was fierce; with players such as Bob John and Frank Hill in the Arsenal squad, Jones only played 16 matches in 1932\u201333. However his knowledge of the game and tactical sense were still appreciated by Arsenal managers Herbert Chapman and Joe Shaw; this meant he was a regular in the 1933\u201334 season, at the end of which he retired from the game, at the age of 34. In all he played 195 games for Arsenal, scoring eight goals."]}, {"page": "Frank Hill", "response": ["In 1932, he was signed by Herbert Chapman's Arsenal, who had just finished as runners-up in both the First Division and FA Cup. He made his debut against Blackburn Rovers on 15 October 1932. At the time, Arsenal were spoilt for wing-halves and Hill competed for his place with Charlie Jones, Bob John, Wilf Copping and Jack Crayston. Despite this, Hill featured in all three of Arsenal's 1933, 1934 and 1935 League title campaigns. He also won the 1934 Charity Shield with the Gunners. Hill usually played at right-half but also deputised at left-half or even on the wing."]}, {"page": "Andy Kennedy (footballer, born 1897)", "response": ["After injury wrecked his 1923-24 season \u2013 Kennedy missed the start of the season, and after returning was dropped from the side after Arsenal lost 6\u20131 to Huddersfield Town \u2013 he played all but one of Arsenal's League matches the following season (as Arsenal narrowly avoided relegation). However, he did not find favour under Herbert Chapman, who first switched Bob John back into defence, and then signed Horace Cope during 1925-26 as a replacement for Kennedy. However, Cope was injured before Arsenal's first FA Cup final, meaning Kennedy started the match, against Cardiff City; however, a mistake by Dan Lewis meant Arsenal lost 1\u20130, and Kennedy only walked away with a runners-up medal."]}, {"page": "1982 in Wales", "response": ["*17 July \u2013 Bob John, footballer, 83"]}, {"page": "Alex Massie", "response": ["In 1950 he was appointed as manager of Torquay United as successor to Bob John, although he only remained as manager until 1951."]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| || Bob John"]}]}}
