On 12 December, Rushden & Diamonds confirmed that Knight had been sacked after continual breaches of conduct between November and December 2008. Despite his contract having been terminated, Rushden & Diamonds retained the player's registration, preventing Knight from joining another English club until the term of his contract had expired, unless \u00a330,000 in compensation was paid to the club. The FA confirmed and validated the retaining of the registration, meaning Knight could not play at any level of English football until the contract had expired. The contract had initially been due to expire following the 2009\u201310 season, but Rushden & Diamonds invoked a clause allowing them to extend the contract by a further year."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Dean McDonald"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["Into March, Blackpool travelled to Gillingham on the third of the month.
