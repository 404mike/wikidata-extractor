As a player, he made 121 appearances between 1912 and 1930, having earlier played in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire. The great majority of his first-class matches were for Worcestershire, though he also played in India for the Europeans and, once, a joint \"Europeans and Parsees\" side. He umpired four first-class games, including one Test match.\nHiggins was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he was in the cricket XI.\nIn his teens and early twenties, Higgins played football as an inside left. He appeared once in the Football League First Division for Birmingham in the 1907\u201308 season, and was also on the books of Aston Villa and Brierley Hill Alliance, retaining his amateur status throughout his football career.He made his first-class cricket debut for Worcestershire against Leicestershire at Amblecote in 1912. Only one day's play was possible in the match, during which Higgins scored 5 and bowled five wicketless overs for 34. It was to be eight years before he played first-class cricket again.\nHis next game for Worcestershire came against Yorkshire at Worcester in 1920, on which occasion he again had an unproductive match: he scored 1 and 0, and took no wickets in 16 overs. Higgins finally claimed his first wicket \u2014 Kent opener Wally Hardinge, caught and bowled \u2014 in his fifth first-class game, at Tonbridge a few days later,\nand he ended the season with unattractive figures of 85 runs at 7.72 and four wickets at 88.25.\nHiggins played not at all in 1921, but in 1922 he had a considerably more successful time of it, scoring 605 runs at 16.35 \u2013 albeit with only one fifty \u2013 and taking 14 wickets, his highest season's aggregate, at 44.07. This year also saw him claim his only five-wicket haul, 5\u201372 against Gloucestershire at Gloucester, restricting the home team to 202 in their first innings. His performance was to no avail, however: Worcestershire were bowled out for 58 and 52, Mills and Parker bowling unchanged throughout the match, and lost by an innings.Higgins was in India during the 1922\u201323 English winter, playing four first-class games including two for Europeans in the Lahore Tournament. He was to make further Indian appearances, five of them in the Bombay Quadrangular, in 1923\u201324, 1924\u201325 and 1928\u201329, though he hit only one fifty (56 for Europeans against Parsees in 1923\u201324) and took just two wickets in his entire career of ten matches in that country.\nMeanwhile, Higgins' English career was barely noticeable: he played twice in each of the 1924 and 1925 seasons, and not at all in 1926. The next three years, however, were to prove by some margin his most successful in the game. He played 19 or 20 matches for Worcestershire every summer, and hit one century in each, the highest of these being the first: 123 against Glamorgan at Kidderminster in July 1927. He scored those runs from number three in the order, but his other two centuries were both made as an opener. In 1928 he reached 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the only time, hitting 1,041 at an average of 30.61.\nHiggins played three final matches for Worcestershire in 1930, without conspicuous success. By this time he had already umpired two first-class games in India in 1926\u201327, and in 1933\u201334 he stood in two more, including the third Test between India and England at Madras. He died in England, in a nursing home in Malvern, aged 84.His younger brother Harry played nearly 100 times for Worcestershire in the 1920s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|John Higgins||||1||1934||1934"]}, {"page": "John Higgins (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Higgins (born 1975) is a Scottish snooker player.", "John Higgins may also refer to:", "* John Higgins (Australian politician) (1884\u20131936), New South Wales politician", "* John Higgins (cricketer) (1885\u20131970), English cricketer", "* John Higgins (swimmer) (1916\u20132004), American swimmer and swimming coach", "* John Higgins (footballer, born 1930) (1930\u20132017), Scottish footballer (Hibernian, St Mirren, Swindon Town)", "* John Higgins (footballer, born 1932) (1932\u20132005), English footballer (Bolton)", "* John Higgins (footballer, born 1933) (1933\u20131994), Scottish footballer (Celtic)", "* John Higgins (bowls) (born 1941), Irish lawn and indoor bowler", "* John Higgins (Gaelic footballer) (born 1963), Irish Gaelic footballer (Kerry)", "* John Higgins (comics) (born 1949), English comic book artist and writer", "* John Higgins (poet) (c. 1544 \u2013 by 1620), English cleric, poet and linguist", "* John Higgins (gunman) (1848\u20131914), cowboy of the Old West", "* John Higgins (admiral) (1899\u20131973), U.S. Navy rear admiral", "* John Higgins (Newcastle town crier), town crier, on whom the character Johnny Luik-up is based"]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| John Higgins"]}, {"page": "List of British people of Indian descent", "response": ["*John Higgins (cricketer) "]}]}}
