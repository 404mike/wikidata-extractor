Edward Jenner described the disease in 1809, and French veterinarian Henri Carr\u00e9 determined that the disease was caused by a virus in 1905. Carr\u00e9's findings were disputed by researchers in England until 1926, when Patrick Laidlaw and G.W. Dunkin confirmed that the disease was, in fact, caused by a virus."]}, {"page": "Christopher Andrewes", "response": ["He served in the Royal Navy as a surgeon during World War I. In 1927 he joined the scientific staff of the National Institute for Medical Research to assist Patrick Laidlaw in developing a vaccine against canine distemper. This led on to research on influenza and the discovery of the causative virus in 1933 and subsequent vaccine development. He was head of NIMR's Division of Bacteriology and Virus Research from 1939 to 1961, during which time he established the Common Cold Research Unit near Salisbury as an NIMR outpost in 1947, and the World Influenza Centre at Mill Hill in 1948, which spawned a worldwide network of collaborating centres.

In 1933 Wilson Smith, Christopher Andrewes, and Patrick Laidlaw isolated the influenza virus. In 1935 Shope found that humans that had been alive during the 1918-1919 swine flu epidemic still carried antibodies against the swine flu virus. Throughout the 1930s Shope continued to research swine flu. While studying swine flu on farms in Iowa Shope discovered that virus infections caused the mad itch, also known as pseudorabies, in cattle. Scope also discovered that virus infection caused fibroma in the cottontail rabbits he had hunted in New Jersey, and that a virus infection was also responsible for the papillomatosis in the cottontail rabbits he had observed in Iowa. By the last 1930s Shope had established himself as a well-known expert with a reputation as a virus hunter."]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Patrick Laidlaw (1881\u20131940), virologist"]}, {"page": "Ann Bishop (biologist)", "response": ["She left that position in 1926, to work for Clifford Dobell at the National Institute for Medical Research where she stayed there for three years. Under Dobell, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae found in the human gastrointestinal tract, focusing on the species responsible for amoebic dysentery, Entamoeba histolytica. Dobell, Bishop, and Patrick Laidlaw studied the effects of amoebicides like emetine for the purpose of treating amoebal diseases.

During his last year of secondary school at the Accrington Grammar School, he also taught at Great Harwood Elementary School.

From 1919 he studied medicine at the University of Manchester with degree qualification as both physician and surgeon (M.B., Ch.B.) in 1923. He was for two years a physician practising clinical medicine in Manchester and worked for one year as a ship's doctor aboard a Blue Funnel Line cargo ship. He then studied bacteriology, graduating with a higher medical degree (M.D.) in 1927. He went into research and led a virus research group at the Medical Research Council in Hampstead in north London. There in 1933  he, in collaboration with Christopher Andrewes and Patrick Laidlaw, succeeded in isolating human influenza A virus and transferring it to ferrets. In 1936 Frank Horsfall, Alice Chenoweth, and colleagues developed, in mouse lung tissue, a live influenza virus vaccine."]}]}}
