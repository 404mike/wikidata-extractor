As they moved past the men, the suffragettes were met by lines of policemen who, instead of arresting them, subjected them to violence and insults, much of which was sexual in nature. The demonstration continued for six hours; police beat women attempting to enter parliament, then threw them into the crowds of onlookers, where they were subjected to further assaults. Many of the suffragettes considered that the crowds of men who also assaulted them were plain clothes policemen. Caxton Hall was used throughout the day as a medical post for suffragettes injured in the demonstration. Sylvia Pankhurst recorded that \"We saw the women go out and return exhausted, with black eyes, bleeding noses, bruises, sprains and dislocations. The cry went round: 'Be careful; they are dragging women down the side streets!' We knew this always meant greater ill-usage.\" One of those taken down a side street was Rosa May Billinghurst, a disabled suffragette who campaigned from a wheelchair. Police pushed her into a side road, assaulted her and stole the valves from the wheels, leaving her stranded. The historian Harold Smith writes \"it appeared to witnesses as well as the victims that the police had intentionally attempted to subject the women to sexual humiliation in a public setting to teach them a lesson\"."]}, {"page": "1953 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 29 July \u2013 Rosa May Billinghurst, suffragette (born 1875)"]}, {"page": "Women's Library", "response": ["Personal archives held at the Women's Library include those of Lesley Abdela, Adelaide Anderson, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Louisa Garrett Anderson, Margery Corbett Ashby, Lydia Becker, Helen Bentwich, Rosa May Billinghurst, Chili Bouchier, Elsie Bowerman, Josephine Butler, Barbara Cartland, Jill Craigie, Emily Wilding Davison, Charlotte Despard, Emily Faithfull, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, Vida Goldstein, Teresa Billington-Greig, Elspeth Howe, Mary Lowndes (see also Artists' Suffrage League Papers), Constance Lytton, Harriet Martineau, Edith How-Martyn, Angela Mason, Hannah More, Helena Normanton, Eleanor Rathbone, Claire Rayner, Sheila Rowbotham, Maude Royden, Myra Sadd Brown, Nancy Seear, Baroness Seear, Elaine Showalter, William Thomas Stead, Mary Stott, Louisa Twining and Henry Wilson."]}, {"page": "1875 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 31 May \u2013 Rosa May Billinghurst, women's suffrage activist (died 1953)"]}, {"page": "Suffragette", "response": ["* Rosa May Billinghurst"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Lewisham", "response": ["*Rosa May Billinghurst (suffragette) lived in Lewisham"]}, {"page": "Billinghurst (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Rosa May Billinghurst (1875-1953), English  suffragette and women's rights activist"]}, {"page": "Annie Barnes (suffragist)", "response": ["Barnes saw the crowd of suffragette protestors in July 1909, outside Edinburgh Castle Hall in Limehouse, including Mary Leigh, Mabel Capper, and Jennie Baines trying to enter the Lloyd George event.

You women are inferior to men anyway\". And Barnes admired the speaker's retort \"how can an inferior give birth to a superior\"  and was drawn to join the movement.
