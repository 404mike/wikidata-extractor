Chamberlain started his career with local side Port Vale, making his debut under Dennis Butler as a substitute in a 2\u20132 home draw with Scunthorpe United on 19 August 1978, aged 16. His full debut came on 14 April 1979 in a 3\u20132 win over Barnsley at Vale Park, and his first goal came two days later in a 3\u20132 defeat at Huddersfield Town. Chamberlain said: \"It was a bonus too, to find the net. Neil Griffiths encouraged me to 'hit it', after I had nipped in before the full back, and the ball flew in.\" He turned professional the following month, having made eight appearances in 1978\u201379. Chamberlain then made eleven goalless appearances in 1979\u201380, whilst his brother was the club's top-scorer in what was Vale's worst season in the Fourth Division. He became a first team regular from October 1980 under John McGrath and scored 10 goals in 36 games in the 1980\u201381 campaign. He was an ever-present in the 55 game 1981\u201382 season, also being selected in the PFA Fourth Division team and chosen as The Star's best player of the division. He scored eight goals during the campaign, most memorably when he stood off the pitch at Field Mill to avoid being caught offside, then returned to tackle a startled Rod Arnold and tap the ball into an empty net."]}, {"page": "1972 UEFA Cup Final", "response": ["|GK||13|| Rod Arnold", "|GK||13||  Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wolverhampton", "response": ["* Rod Arnold \u2013 (born 1952), football goalkeeper, spent the most of his career at Mansfield Town; with 513 first-team appearances, (440 in the league), he is the holder of the club's all-time appearance record."]}, {"page": "List of Mansfield Town F.C. players", "response": ["Goalkeeper Rod Arnold owns the club record for most games played for Mansfield Town.

On 12 September, their club-record run of six consecutive draws came to an end. Four victories in five games then put Vale into seventh place, and Colin Tartt was signed from Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Sheffield United in front of the television cameras was the first of a run of four defeats in five games, and sent an injury-hit Vale down into mid-table. In November, Lee Harwood was forced to retire with a knee injury. Vale then went on a fifteen match unbeaten run in the league, and between 20 January and 6 March the team went on a club-record six consecutive home draws. Stoke City offered \u00a3100,000 plus incentives for Mark Chamberlain, but Chairman Don Ratcliffe called the offer 'an insult' and rejected it out of hand. Instead Tony Sealy arrived on loan, this time from Queens Park Rangers. On 6 February Mark Chamberlain scored a memorable goal at Field Mill when he stood off the pitch to avoid being caught offside, then returned to tackle a startled Rod Arnold and tap the ball into an empty net. Mansfield Town manager Stuart Boam was so enraged that the goal stood that he raced onto the pitch to verbally abuse the linesman. In March, Johnny Miller had to retire with a knee injury. On 20 March, Mark Harrison conceded 'a crazy goal' from Hull City left-back Dennis Booth at Boothferry Park, whose fifty yard free kick hit the back of the net after several bounces. Injuries hit the Vale squad and the promotion campaign faded away. On 1 May, Vale Park witnessed its lowest ever Football League attendance when a mere 1,924 turned up against York City."]}, {"page": "History of Mansfield Town F.C.", "response": ["| Rod Arnold  (1970\u201371, 1972\u201384)  522 games || 1 || Harry Johnson  (1931\u201336)  114 goals"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Rod Arnold"]}]}}
