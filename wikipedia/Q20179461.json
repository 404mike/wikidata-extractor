Vielle always believed that his ideas for the \"Vielle Bombing System\" with a television camera in the nose, developed after the war, laid the groundwork for the development of the cruise missile. It was reported by the Wiltshire Times that he flew as many as 150 different types of aircraft during his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cruise missile", "response": ["* Eugene Vielle (pioneer of technology that led to the Cruise missile)"]}, {"page": "1913", "response": ["* April 29 \u2013 Eugene Vielle, British Royal Air Force officer (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "Handley Page H.P.42", "response": ["The H.P.42 was intended for the Africa and India services. They were based in Cairo. In June 1939, RAF pilot Eugene Vielle was dispatched to Cairo to fly an H.P. 42 back to England. He had to wait until December for spare parts to arrive to get the aircraft into good flying condition. His flight back to RAF Lakenheath, with at intermediate stop at Gibraltar for fuel, was uneventful until he reached the airspace near Lakenheath. As he circled, waiting for other planes in the area to clear the flight path for his landing, his aircraft began to experience engine trouble \u2013 possibly due to icing in the engine cowlings due to the frigid winter conditions over Lakenheath \u2013 and he was forced to parachute from the aircraft. He landed awkwardly in a sheep farmer's field adjacent the runway, breaking both legs."]}, {"page": "List of centenarians (military commanders and soldiers)", "response": ["|Eugene Vielle || 1913\u20132015 || 101 || British Royal Air Force officer"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Eugene Vielle, 101, air force officer and inventor."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2015", "response": ["*Eugene Vielle, 101, British air force officer and inventor.Group Captain Eugene 'Tubby' Vielle \u2013 obituary"]}]}}
