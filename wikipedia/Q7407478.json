Others are bright orchestral pieces. Fonteyn's work has been heard on television since he recorded for Boosey & Hawkes in the 1970s. A music library recording was used as the theme of the British sitcom Please Sir! in 1968, and \"Pop Looks Bach,\" recorded in 1970, was later used as the theme of the long-running television programme Ski Sunday.  His work has been featured recently on SpongeBob SquarePants, Ren & Stimpy, Nirvanna the Band the Show, and Family Guy (a vaudeville duo use Fonteyn's \"Galloping Gertie\" as a vamp in a recurring gag).\nSoden was born in Birmingham and died in Islington, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Day the Universe Changed", "response": ["*Episode 9: Mozart: String Quartet No. 3 in G; Bernhard Crusell: Grand Concerto No. 2 in F minor; Arthur Sullivan: \"Imperial March\" from Utopia Limited; Anton Karas: Harry Lime Theme; Sam Fonteyn: Comedy Capers."]}, {"page": "Please Sir!", "response": ["The theme tune \"School's Out\" was by Sam Fonteyn."]}, {"page": "Natural Born Killers (soundtrack)", "response": ["In the scene that depicts Mickey and Mallory's first meeting \u2013 as a sitcom parody entitled \"I Love Mallory\" \u2013 the following pieces are heard: \"Happy-Go-Lively\" by Laurie Johnson, \"Happy Families\" by Sam Fonteyn, \"Pizzicato Playtime\" by Sam Fonteyn, and \"Domestic Fun\" by Ernest Tomlinson."]}, {"page": "Ski Sunday", "response": ["The theme music to the programme is \"Pop Looks Bach\" by Sam Fonteyn, which was also used as the theme tune for the BBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics until the 2006 Games.
