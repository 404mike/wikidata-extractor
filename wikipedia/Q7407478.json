Others are bright orchestral pieces. Fonteyn's work has been heard on television since he recorded for Boosey & Hawkes in the 1970s. A music library recording was used as the theme of the British sitcom Please Sir! in 1968, and \"Pop Looks Bach,\" recorded in 1970, was later used as the theme of the long-running television programme Ski Sunday.  His work has been featured recently on SpongeBob SquarePants, Ren & Stimpy, Nirvanna the Band the Show, and Family Guy (a vaudeville duo use Fonteyn's \"Galloping Gertie\" as a vamp in a recurring gag).\nSoden was born in Birmingham and died in Islington, London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
