Though he only played a cameo role in his five years at the Glanford Park, he was highly thought of by the club's supporters. He learned the ropes under first team manager Brian Laws and his assistant Russ Wilcox. Barwick was bred from the same youth side that featured Matthew Sparrow and Andy Butler and like the pair and other players who come through United's youth ranks, he did well enough to keep himself at the club for a reasonable period. His performances earned him a new one-year contract in both May 2003 and again in 2004. Barwick was to only make the single appearance for the club in the 2004\u201305 promotion winning campaign and at the end of the season he was deemed surplus to requirements and was released by the club."]}, {"page": "Doncaster Rovers Belles L.F.C.", "response": ["They are one of English women's football's most famous and successful clubs, being one of only three non-London teams to have won the FA Women's Premier League National Division, in 1992 and 1994.
