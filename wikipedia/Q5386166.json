That same year, he first staged his version of Phantom of the Opera at the Duke's Playhouse in Lancaster (and also on Morecambe Pier). In 1983, he adapted Catherine Cookson's Katie Mulholland into an elaborate stage musical for the Playhouse with songs by Eric Boswell. In 1984, an updated version of Phantom of the Opera was revived and produced in a joint-production with the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Andrew Lloyd Webber saw and liked it, and for a while there was talk about his bringing it into the West End. Nothing came of this, however, and Lloyd Webber's own version duly opened in the West End in 1986. Hill's Phantom went abroad to St. Louis in the United States in 1987 and also had another major production in San Francisco in 1988. The musical then embarked on a two-year-long national tour of the US from 1989 to 1991. The show also transferred to the West End in 1991 but, despite excellent notices, did badly at the box office and was forced to close earlier than expected. Since then, Phantom of the Opera has arguably become one of his most famous works, and has toured the world \u2013 the most recent production was in Tokyo, Japan in November 2004."]}, {"page": "County Palatine of Durham", "response": ["Other notable performers/songwriters who were born or raised in the county include Paddy McAloon, Eric Boswell, Jeremy Spencer, Alan Clark, Martin Brammer, Robert Blamire, Thomas Allen, Zoe Birkett, John O'Neill, Karen Harding and Courtney Hadwin."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sunderland", "response": ["* Eric Boswell, songwriter (Little Donkey)"]}, {"page": "Little Donkey", "response": ["Little Donkey is a popular Christmas carol, written by British songwriter Eric Boswell in 1959, which describes the journey by Mary the mother of Jesus to Bethlehem on the donkey of the title."]}, {"page": "Humshaugh", "response": ["Eric Boswell, composer of the Christmas song \"Little Donkey\" and many other popular and folk songs, lived in Humshaugh from 1985 to 2009 and often played organ for services at St Peter's Church."]}, {"page": "Boswell (surname)", "response": ["*Eric Boswell (songwriter) (1921\u20132009), English songwriter"]}, {"page": "Graeme Danby", "response": ["Between 2005 and 2009 Danby and Valerie Reid recorded various songs by Tyneside folk composer Eric Boswell including his most famous Little Donkey and several humorous Geordie ballads written by Boswell on subjects suggested by Danby."]}, {"page": "The Northumbria Anthology", "response": ["Eric Boswell,"]}, {"page": "Scott Dobson", "response": ["His materials were also much used (together with songs from Eric Boswell) on the BBC's Geordierama, a radio programme and later an annual stage show as part of the Newcastle Festival, which presented songs and sketches mainly in dialect and featured Mike Neville, George House and guests including Bobby \"The Little Waster\" Thompson and Dick Irwin."]}, {"page": "Eric Boswell", "response": ["Eric Boswell may refer to:", "* Eric Boswell (songwriter) (1921\u20132009), songwriter known for the Christmas song \"Little Donkey\""]}, {"page": "List of Geordie songwriters", "response": ["* Eric Boswell - songwriter/poet"]}]}}
