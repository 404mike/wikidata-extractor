He was one of the most successful visual discoverers of novae and comets.\nGeorge\u2019s interest in astronomy was sparked by seeing the solar eclipse of 8 April 1921. His interest evolved into the observation of meteors and meteor showers, and on 27 March 1935 he joined the British Astronomical Association. In 1953 he decided to start searching for comets and in 1955 began searching for novae. His technique was to memorize the patterns of thousands of stars, so that he would visually recognize any intruder.\nIn 1959 he discovered comet C/1959 Q1 (Alcock), the first comet discovered in Britain since 1894, and only five days later discovered another, C/1959 Q2 (Alcock). He discovered two more comets in 1963 (C/1963 F1 Alcock) and 1965. He later discovered his first nova, Nova Delphini 1967 (HR Delphini), which turned out to have an unusual light-curve. He discovered two more novae, LV Vul (in 1968) and V368 Sct (in 1970). He found his fifth and final comet in 1983: C/1983 H1 (IRAS-Araki-Alcock). In 1991 he found the nova V838 Her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amateur astronomy", "response": ["* George Alcock, discovered several comets and novae."]}, {"page": "Peterborough", "response": ["Peterborough is the birthplace of many notable people, the astronomer George Alcock, one of the most successful visual discoverers of novas and comets;Obituary of George Eric Deacon Alcock  Journal of the British Astronomical Association, vol.111 no.2 (pp.64\u201366) February 2001.

A comet is named after its first independent discoverers, up to a maximum of three names, separated by hyphens. The IAU prefers to credit at most two discoverers, and it credits more than three discoverers only when \"in rare cases where named lost comets are identified with a rediscovery that has already received a new name.\" In recent years, many comets have been discovered by instruments operated by large teams of astronomers, and in this case, comets may be named for the instrument (for example, Comet IRAS\u2013Araki\u2013Alcock (C/1983 H1) was discovered independently by the IRAS satellite and amateur astronomers Genichi Araki and George Alcock). Comet 105P/Singer Brewster, discovered by Stephen Singer-Brewster, should by rights have been named \"105P/Singer-Brewster\", but this could be misinterpreted as a joint discovery by two astronomers named Singer and Brewster, respectively, so the hyphen was replaced by a space.
