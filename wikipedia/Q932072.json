Bright was rushed into the squad to play the Central Coast Mariners at North Harbour Stadium, and produced a Man of the Match performance as he played the full 90 minutes on debut as the New Zealand side went down 1\u20133. Bright's performance in his first match earned praise from Knights manager John Adshead, and he was rewarded with a starting place in the following match against the Newcastle United Jets. Bright appeared in the Knights's following four games up until Emblen's return from injury, but had done enough to retain his position in the squad, having signed another short-term contract, this time to cover for Joshua Rose.
