I get the car\", etc. The whole concept is an industry joke about the supposed tendency for comics to get increased sales from a picture of a gorilla, a weeping character, or the color purple on the cover.As described by Mark Waid in an editorial in Secret Origins Volume 2, number 40. Occasionally Moore shows snippets of the gorilla's foil, the Chucklin' Duck, who is happy-go-lucky and naively optimistic, with smug saying such as \"Heh heh! I got out of internet trading just in time!\". Both the Weeping Gorilla and Chucklin' Duck motifs were used in the Greyshirt: Indigo Sunset series by Rick Veitch, and a Weeping Gorilla Comix panel makes a cameo appearance in the story \"King Solomon Pines\" in Tom Strong's Terrific Tales #5 (scripted by Leah Moore and illustrated by Sergio Aragones).
