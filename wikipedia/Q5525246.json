He played in The Football League for four clubs.\nHobson began his career as an apprentice with Hull City, making his league debut during the 1990\u201391 season. Over the next six years he went on to make nearly 150 league appearances for the Tigers before switching to Brighton & Hove Albion in March 1996 for \u00a360,000.\nIn January 2000, new Chester City manager Ian Atkins recruited Hobson as the club battled against relegation from The Football League, initially on loan. He played regularly in defence throughout the remainder of the season, but was unable to help Chester avoid being relegated at the end of the season.\nHobson remained in Division Three with York City. He spent three years with the Minstermen, with his final Football League appearance being against Exeter City in April 2003. In the following months, Hobson spent time with non-league clubs Spennymoor United, Ossett Town and North Ferriby United. He has worked for the sports marketing agency HI Sport and Travel, often working abroad in the process.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hobson (surname)", "response": ["* Gary Hobson, English former professional footballer", "* Gary Hobson, leading character of the television series Early Edition"]}, {"page": "Chris Smith (footballer, born 1981)", "response": ["Smith had a two-match trial with Third Division club York City at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, impressing manager Terry Dolan. With him due to be released by Reading, Smith signed for York on 26 May 2001 on a two-year contract. He made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute for Matt Hocking in a 3\u20132 home defeat against Exeter City on 6 October 2001. Smith made his first start for York in the following match, a 3\u20130 defeat away to Hartlepool United on 13 October 2001, Dolan describing his performance \"as the one bright spot\" from the match. However, following York's 4\u20131 away defeat by Kidderminster Harriers on 23 October 2001, Dolan placed the blame on the team's inexperienced defence. He did not feature in the team again until being recalled for an FA Cup first round 0\u20130 draw away to Colchester United on 17 November 2001. According to the Evening Press, Smith gave a \"near-faultless display\" when York beat his former club Reading 2\u20130 at home in the FA Cup second round on 8 December 2001. He was forced to miss the Christmas period with a virus, which resulted in him losing his place in the team, with Mike Basham, Gary Hobson and Hocking forming solid partnership. After being sent off for the first time in his career in a 3\u20130 defeat away to Rushden & Diamonds on 19 January 2002, he received a one-match suspension. Smith was substituted at half-time in York's 1\u20131 away draw with Halifax Town on 12 February 2002 due to a tight hamstring, returning over two months later in a 3\u20130 home victory over Bristol Rovers on 16 April.
