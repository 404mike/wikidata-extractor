A right-handed batsman and right-arm leg-break and googly bowler, he was known for his attacking style of play. He  captained  both his county and his country; after the Second World War, he served several terms as a Test selector.\nBorn into a cricketing family, Robins attended Highgate School, where he earned a reputation as one of the outstanding schoolboy cricketers of his generation. He made his debut in first-class cricket, for Middlesex, in 1925. At Cambridge he won cricket \"blues\" in each of his three years, 1926 to 1928. He played his first Test match, against South Africa, in 1929, and thereafter played intermittently for England in each of the seasons up to 1937 \u2013 he played all his cricket as an amateur, which constrained his availability for both county and country. He toured Australia as vice-captain to G.O. Allen in 1936\u201337, and assumed the captaincy of the international side for three matches in 1937. He captained Middlesex from 1935 to 1938, again after the war in 1946 and 1947, and for a final season in 1950. In 1947 he led Middlesex to the County Championship.\nRobins was a member of the Test selectors' panel in 1946\u201348, in 1954, and finally in 1962\u201364 when he acted as chairman. He was controversially involved in an unsuccessful attempt, in 1954, to replace the current England captain, Len Hutton, with the young and inexperienced David Sheppard. He was a strong advocate of \"brighter cricket\", to an extent that sometimes failed to recognise the realities of international cricket in the postwar era, and put him at odds with the players of a later generation. This problem was evident when Robins served as manager of the touring team to the West Indies in 1959\u201360, when his forthright, autocratic approach adversely affected his relationship with the team's captain and vice-captain, Peter May  and Colin Cowdrey.\nWhatever his difficulties in coming to terms with the cricket of a later era, Robins was widely recognised as one of the most dynamic cricketers of his time, a fact that was acknowledged in the tributes paid after his death, in 1968, by his former playing colleagues. His son, Charles Robins, played for Middlesex from 1953 to 1960, as a leg-spin and googly bowler in the manner of his father.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 3", "response": ["*  1906   \u2013 Walter Robins, English cricketer and footballer (d. 1968)"]}, {"page": "Bodyline", "response": ["The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930.

The English cricket authorities felt that specific tactics would be required to curtail Bradman from being even more successful on his own Australian pitches;Frith, pp. 39\u201341. some believed that Bradman was at his most vulnerable against leg-spin bowling as Walter Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; consequently two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932\u201333.Douglas, p. 121."]}, {"page": "Left-arm unorthodox spin", "response": ["The origin of the term is unclear, although it is known to have been in use in Yorkshire during the 1920s and may have been first used in reference to Roy Kilner.Maurice Leyland, Obituary, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1968.

It is first known to have been used in print in The Guardian in 1926 in reference to the possibility of Yorkshire bowler George Macaulay bowling a googly, but the term became more widely used after a Test match between England and West Indies at Old Trafford in 1933. Ellis Achong, a player of Chinese origin who bowled slow left-arm orthodox spin, had Walter Robins stumped off a surprise delivery that spun into the right-hander from outside the off stump. As he walked back to the pavilion, Robins reportedly said to the umpire, \"fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman!\",Andrew Wu (26 March 2017) Australia v India Test series 2017: Does cricket really need to continue using the term 'chinaman'?, The Sydney Morning Herald.

Cowdrey was chosen to open the innings with Geoff Pullar as May thought he was the best player of fast bowling. Even though it was not to Cowdrey's liking he made 491 runs (54.55) and two centuries. England won the Second Test by 256 runs despite play being held up by a riot, but May suffered an internal injury and had to go to hospital every morning before play. May soldiered on, but Cowdrey knew he would soon be in charge and was so affected by nerves before the Third Test that he \"would have given anything not to have played\".Cowdrey, p. 41 To face the fast bowlers he wore rubber padding sewn into his shirt and recovered to make 114 and 97 despite Wes Hall taking 7/69 in England's first innings of 277, no one else making over 30. May had to fly home for treatment (and was unfit to play for 18 months) so Cowdrey took charge in the Fourth Test, winning the toss and top scoring with 65 in England's 295 as Hall took 6/90. The West Indies overtook this with 402, but Ted Dexter (110) and Raman Subba Row (100) saved the match. In the Fifth Test Brian Statham flew home to his sick son, but Cowdrey won the toss and again chose to bat, top scoring with 119 in England's 393.", "Peter May required several operations and did not play in the 1960 season, but he was expected to return and Cowdrey was only made captain of England against South Africa as each game came up, rather than for the whole series. Even so, it was the first of only two occasions that Cowdrey captained England throughout a Test series. It proved to be an easy 3\u20130 win as the inexperienced Springbok side met a damp English summer and lost the first three Tests by 100 runs, an innings and 73 runs and 8 wickets. In the Third Test the South African captain Jackie McGlew was run out after colliding with an English fielder, the umpires did not allow Cowdrey to call him back and he was widely blamed for not withdrawing the appeal before McGlew left the field. In the Fifth Test England were dismissed for 155, saw South Africa make 479/9 declared and were criticised by Walter Robins, the new Chairman of Selectors. In response Cowdrey made 155 and added 290 for the first wicket with Geoff Pullar (175) to save the match.Cowdrey, pp. 123\u2013125"]}, {"page": "Stafford", "response": ["*Walter Robins (1906\u20131968) cricketer and footballer.

He played in the first Test against Pakistan, on their first tour of England, scored a duck and missed the next two matches. In Hutton's absence, the selectors appointed the amateur David Sheppard, a theology student at the time; Sheppard achieved little batting success, but England won one of the two Tests in which he was captain. According to Wisden editor Norman Preston, influential figures within the cricket hierarchy blamed Hutton for the previous winter's events and attempted to replace him as captain. Two former England cricketers, Errol Holmes and Walter Robins, the latter also a selector that year, favoured Sheppard over Hutton and persuaded him to offer his candidacy to captain the MCC in Australia that winter. Sheppard indicated he would accept the post and take a leave of absence from his studies if required.Gibson, pp. 186\u201387. The press speculated that Hutton would step aside, but most newspapers favoured his continued leadership and ran stories alleging MCC prejudice against professional cricketers. Neither Hutton nor Sheppard publicly expressed an opinion, although Hutton informed the MCC he would tour Australia as captain or player as required, and both men remained on good personal terms throughout. Robins, seeing the strength of opinion, backed down. When Hutton returned to cricket in July, scoring two centuries, he was appointed captain of the MCC for the winter tour. Returning to captain a slightly weakened team for the fourth and final Test, Hutton failed with the bat, and Pakistan recorded their first Test victory. In his three Test innings of the season, Hutton scored just 19 runs. Owing to his reduced appearances, Hutton failed to reach 1,000 first-class runs for the first time since 1936, reaching 912 runs at an average of 35.07."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Walter Robins"]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["In his first Test as captain, Jardine clashed with several players. Frank Woolley was unhappy with his captain's manner, feeling humiliated at his treatment in the field at one point. He also rebuked Ian Peebles and Walter Robins, two young amateur bowlers, for their amusement over an incident in the match.Peebles, pp. 86\u201387. The home team's fortunes were mixed, as New Zealand put up a very good fight in their first Test in England, and both sides could have won. The New Zealanders were so successful that a further two Tests were arranged. Jardine was criticised in the press for not instructing his batsmen to score quickly enough to win in the fourth innings, although this strategy was unlikely to succeed, and the match was drawn.Douglas, p. 99. England won the second Test by an innings and the third Test was drawn, sealing the series 1\u20130. Jardine had a top score of just 38 in the series, but only batted four times and was not out in three of the innings. At the beginning of the following season, Wisden's editor believed that, as Jardine had failed to impress (unspecified) people with his captaincy, he was no longer a certainty to lead the side to Australia, and only Percy Chapman's lack of form prevented his reinstatement at Jardine's expense. As a batsman, Jardine was more impressive in Wisden's opinion, showing himself to be good in defence despite his lack of cricket in the past two seasons. A notable innings was his 104 for The Rest to prevent defeat against champion county Yorkshire. The opposition bowling, particularly from Bill Bowes, was short and hostile, but Jardine survived for over four hours.Douglas, p. 100. He scored 1,104 first-class runs for the season at an average of 64.94."]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| 38 || Walter Robins || 1937 || || New Zealand || England || 3 || 1 || 0 || 2"]}, {"page": "Ken Barrington", "response": ["The West Indian fast bowlers Wes Hall and Chester Watson were rightly feared, but on a true pitch at the Kensington Oval in the First Test they could be played and coming in at number 3 Barrington made his maiden Test century128 in England's 482.

He was given out caught by Gerry Alexander off Sonny Ramadhin, but hesitated to walk after the umpire's decision and was made to apologise by the MCC manager Walter Robins.
