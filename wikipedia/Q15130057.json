He was Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire at the University of Oxford. In addition, he was Director of the British School at Rome from 1930 to 1932, President of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies from 1958 to 1961, and Director of the Society of Antiquaries of London from 1959 to 1964.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mortimer Wheeler", "response": ["Wheeler was impatient to start excavations, and in July 1921 started a six-week project to excavate at the Roman fort of Segontium; accompanied by his wife, he used up his holiday to oversee the project. A second season of excavation at the site followed in 1922. Greatly influenced by the writings of the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, Wheeler emphasised the need for a strong, developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation, believing in the need for strategic planning, or what he termed \"controlled discovery\", with clear objectives in mind for a project. Further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results, he wrote full seasonal reports for Archaeologia Cambrensis before publishing a full report, Segontium and the Roman Occupation of Wales. Wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists, and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at Segontium were Victor Nash-Williams and Ian Richmond.", "In 1956, Wheeler retired from his part-time professorship at the Institute of Archaeology. Childe was also retiring from his position of director that year, and Wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him. Wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of W.F. Grimes, deeming his career undistinguished; instead, he championed Glyn Daniel as a candidate, although ultimately Grimes was selected. That year, Wheeler's marriage broke down, and he moved from his wife's house to a former brothel at 27 Whitcomb Street in central London. From 1954 to 1959, he served as the President of the Society of Antiquaries, and after resigning supported Ian Richmond as his replacement; however, Joan Evans was selected. From 1964 to 1966 he served as Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board, stepping down when he concluded that he was too old for the role."]}, {"page": "Trimontium (Newstead)", "response": ["The fort was constructed in multiple phases. Dr Simon Clarke of Bradford University has produced a logical sequence of building and destruction for the fort and its annexes. This was managed by combining evidence from the first excavations of James Curle (1905\u20131910) and Sir Ian Richmond (1947) with aerial photographs and modern search and rescue excavations of Bradford University (1987\u20131997)", "Sir Ian Richmond undertook small scale excavations and some re-interpretations of Curle's work in 1947. At this time, with the advent and development of aerial photography as a tool in modern archaeological research, Dr J.K. St Joseph's work at Trimontium revealed up to nine temporary encampments, evidenced through cropmarkings."]}, {"page": "R. G. Collingwood", "response": ["The result was alluring and influential.

Simpson and continuing with Ian Richmond from 1927 to 1933 . The gateways and walls were then re-excavated under the supervision of Brenda Swinbank and J P Gillam from 1949\u20131950. Excavations between 1987 and 1992 showed an unbroken sequence of occupation on the site of the fort granaries, running from the late Roman period until possibly 500AD. The granaries were replaced by two successive large timber halls, reminiscent of others found in many parts of Britain dating to the 5th and 6th centuries.  Tony Wilmott (director of the excavations) has suggested that, after the end of Roman rule in Britain, the fort served as the power-base for a local warband descended from the late Roman garrison and possibly deriving legitimacy from their ancestors for several generations."]}, {"page": "1964 in archaeology", "response": ["* Ian Richmond knighted."]}, {"page": "1965 in archaeology", "response": ["* October 5 - Sir Ian Richmond, British archaeologist of Ancient Rome (b. 1902)."]}, {"page": "1902 in archaeology", "response": ["* May 10 \u2013 Ian Richmond, British archaeologist of Ancient Rome (d. 1965)."]}, {"page": "Ravenna Cosmography", "response": ["In 1949, Sir Ian Richmond and O G S Crawford published a paper they had originally submitted to Archaeologia, which suggested that the sources for the document had included maps or road books, and that many place names described geographical features.

The archaeologist Ian Richmond identified it in 1922 on placename and archaeological grounds with the Roman legionary fortress at Inchtuthill north of modern-day Perth, which he excavated and believed to have been constructed with merlons, which he translated into Latin as pinnae. This theory was supported in 1949 by O. G. S. Crawford, and is still the identification given by Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. Later scholars have rejected this suggestion, pointing out that Ptolemy's coordinates clearly place Pinnata Castra on the Moray coast, a conclusion further supported by the fact that both Ptolemy and the Ravenna Cosmography place Pinnata Castra near Tuesis, which is generally identified with the River Spey."]}]}}
