He raced for Bath Cycling Club in the early 1960s and also Gordano Valley CC. He was noted for racing the first production \u2018Moulton\u2019 cycles and was televised by ITN in 1962, racing a Moulton Special. He took part in the original Cardiff to London 162 mile Time trials and, with others, broke the speed record for that event with the fastest time being achieved by John Woodburn of Reading (6hrs and 44 minutes). Tovey worked for Alex Moulton in the early 60s and was part of the Moulton eight.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Moulton Bicycle", "response": ["When the design was released in 1962, it was one of the first major innovations in bicycle design since the \"safety bicycle\" in the 1880s and made an immediate impact. The 1962 version (aka \"bicycle of the future\") was the first production Moulton bicycle with suspension and the racing version was televised the same year in action by road race champion and Moulton employee John Ronald Tovey. As Moulton bicycles became an icon of the Swinging Sixties and were sold around the world by the thousands, Moulton was briefly one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in Britain. The architecture and design critic Peter Reyner Banham, known for often controversial views on technology and industrialisation, was a keen advocate and user of the original Moulton.  Eleanor Bron's 1978 book Life and Other Punctures celebrates travels around France on an original Moulton. In bicycle culture, the rider of a Moulton bicycle is often referred to as being a \"Moultoneer\" (a play on the word \"Mountaineer\")."]}, {"page": "Tovey", "response": ["* John Ronald Tovey, British cyclist"]}]}}
