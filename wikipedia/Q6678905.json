When St Paul's Church opened, Arthur wanted all 1,200 seats to be free, but Henry held the more old-fashioned view that there should be a mix.  Accordingly, 460 pews were for rent and the rest were free; Arthur Wagner abolished all rented pews in 1873 after his father's death. The controversial subject caused Henry Wagner problems at other times.  In 1858, his nephew Rev. Thomas Coombe\u2014Perpetual curate of All Saints Church\u2014got into a disagreement with him after altering the interior to add extra pews for rent, and tried to prevent Wagner entering the church.  Wagner had to appeal to the Bishop of Chichester Ashurst Gilbert to deal with the situation. The events of 1824 and St Margaret's Chapel also left Wagner with \"an enduring dislike of proprietary chapels\".  In his 46 years as Vicar of Brighton, during an era when their construction was commonplace, he allowed no others to be built after St Margaret's, St George's, Holy Trinity and St Mary's were completed (the last of these opened in 1827.) When the rector of St Christopher's Church, Lympsham offered in 1858 to pay for a new proprietary chapel in Brighton with 100 free pews and 200 for rent, both Wagner and his sister wrote to him \"kindly but firmly\" describing his \"insuperable objection\" to such chapels. As Vicar of Brighton, he gained the right of presentation after each proprietary chapel had been open for 40 years; but in 1856 the Marquess of Blandford tried to abolish this right by raising a bill before Parliament.  Wagner, who \"clung firmly to the rights of presentation\" he expected to receive, tried to persuade the Marquess to exclude Brighton's four proprietary chapels from the bill\u2014first by going through his solicitor friend Somers Clarke, then by asking Brighton MPs Lord Alfred Hervey (1816\u20131875) and Sir George Brooke-Pechell, 4th Baronet for their support.  The bill did not pass into law, and the right of presentation did eventually pass to Wagner in each case."]}, {"page": "List of ministerial by-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|Lord Alfred Hervey", "|Lord Alfred Hervey"]}, {"page": "1842 Brighton by-election", "response": ["The 1842 Brighton by-election was held on 5 May 1842 after the resignation of the incumbent Whig MP Isaac Newton Wigney.
