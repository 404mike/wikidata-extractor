She became known as \"The Essence of Eccentricity\". She dressed in ultra-tight skirts \u2014 so tight in fact, that she would lie down on the stage and shuffle back and forth on her back to pick up whatever she had contrived to drop. Her hat sported a lone daisy, feather, or fish bone, and once even a lit candle \u2014 supposedly, so she could see where she was going and where she had been.", "link_mentions": {}}}
