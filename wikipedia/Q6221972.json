The parish register of Witton-cum-Twambrooks records a baptism for John Birkenhead, son of Randall, on 24 March 1615 but a note next to the entry claims it is a modern forgery.\nHe was educated at Witton Grammar School, Northwich. He proceeded to Oxford University, and was a Fellow of All Souls' from 1639 to 1648. Birkenhead began producing England's first official news-book Mercurius Aulicus in 1643.  The principal writer was Peter Heylin but Birkenhead brought satire, slanders and incisive polemics which the parliamentary party found difficult to rebuff.\nHis loyalty to the royalist party was rewarded on the restoration of the monarchy when he was made licenser of the press and joint editor, with Henry Muddiman, of the new official news-book Mercurius Publicus.  His contribution to journalism after the restoration was slight, concentrating more on a political career and being elected MP for Wilton, Wiltshire in June 1661.  He was knighted the following year and was a founding member of the Royal Society. In 1664 he was sworn in as a Master of Requests, serving until his death.He is buried in an unmarked grave near the school door at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1616 in literature", "response": ["*March 24 \u2013 John Birkenhead, English political writer and journalist (died 1679)"]}, {"page": "St Martin-in-the-Fields", "response": ["A number of notables were buried in this phase of the church, including Robert Boyle, Nell Gwyn, John Parkinson and Sir John Birkenhead."]}, {"page": "Birkenhead (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Birkenhead (c. 1617\u20131879), British political writer and journalist"]}, {"page": "Master of the Faculties", "response": ["*Sir John Birkenhead"]}, {"page": "Sir John Birkenhead", "response": ["#redirectJohn Birkenhead"]}, {"page": "Henry Muddiman", "response": ["Muddiman was born in the Strand, London. He was educated in St Clement's Temple and at St John's College, Cambridge, after which he worked as a school teacher.  He began producing two regular newsbooks - Parliamentary Intelligencer and Mercurius Publicus - in late 1659 on the proceedings of the newly reconvened Rump Parliament.  This seems to have been at the suggestion of George Monck, who also received good publicity.  On 16 April 1660 this role was secured when all other such journals were banned particularly those of Marchamont Needham the chief Cromwellian publisher.  Muddiman received a monopoly of print along with arch-royalist John Birkenhead as a supervising editor."]}, {"page": "Marchamont Nedham", "response": ["Nedham came to prominence in 1643 when he began working on Mercurius Britanicus, a weekly news-book espousing the parliamentary politics of the era, mainly written as a response to the royalist Mercurius Aulicus of John Birkenhead.  The Britanicus was originally edited by Captain Thomas Audley, but it has been suggested that Nedham was responsible for the content much earlier, as the style changed little when he took over in May 1644. Britanicus was more overtly polemical and savage than the satirical Aulicus; often refuting the royalist title point for point.  Nedham also personalised the debate, declaring that Aulicus was \"So full of lying and railing, that I think he is afflicted by all the pimp.\" The publication of Charles I's personal letters which were captured after the Battle of Naseby was a significant propaganda coup for the parliamentary forces. However, when Nedham began to launch attacks on the personality of the king and mock his stammer he drew censure from the House of Lords from members who felt he had gone too far. When Nedham again attacked the king during delicate negotiations with the Scots in May 1646, he was sent to the Fleet prison for two weeks for seditious libel. Upon his release he was banned from publishing but probably authored some of the many anonymous pamphlets around at the time."]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["John Birkenheadnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Sir John Berkenhead", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Birkenhead"]}, {"page": "John Berkenhead", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Birkenhead"]}, {"page": "Mercurius Aulicus", "response": ["John Birkenhead, a Fellow of All Souls College in Oxford, was appointed editor of the newspaper, receiving updates on events around the country from Digby's contacts,Wedgwood 1970, p. 154. although his colleague Peter Heylin appears to have done much of the practical editing himself.Thomas 1969, p. 31.
