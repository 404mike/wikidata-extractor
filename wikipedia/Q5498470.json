In the Escuela Aguado describes his use of fingernails on the right hand as well as his invention of a \"tripodison\": a device that held the guitar and thus minimized the damping effect of the player's body on the guitar's back and sides. Aguado's other works include Trois Rondos Brillants (Opus 2), Le Menuet Affandangado (Opus 15), Le Fandango Varie (Opus 16), as well as numerous waltzes, minuets, and other light pieces.

This is dedicated to the well-known patron of music, Cardinal Benedetto Panfili, a great-grandson of Pope Innocent X who was Cardinal Legate in Bologna from 1690 and later librarian of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana in Rome . It was transcribed into modern notation and arranged for the six-string guitar by Oscar Chilesotti in 1881. The work consists of nine complete suites, each comprising a preludio and alemanda followed by some of the other seventeenth-century dance forms such as corrente, sarabanda, gigue, minuet and gavotta. The last movement of the ninth suite is a passacaglia which was orchestrated by Ottorino Respighi and included in his Ancient Airs and Dances Suite no. 3. Roncalli's music is a great favorite of guitar enthusiasts, and individual movements frequently appear in guitar method books. Frederick Noad, who compiled an anthology titled The Baroque Guitar, as well as other popular instruction books, did not rate the Chilesotti transcription highly, pointing to many omitted embellishments and octave errors relating to the fourth and fifth strings . Roncalli probably used a bourdon or low octave string only on the fourth course with the fifth course re-entrant \u2013 a method of stringing particularly associated with his compatriot Francesco Corbetta and widely used in the latter part of the seventeenth century \u2013 e' bb gg dd' aa.
