He worked as a charted architect in London, Buckinghamshire, and Yorkshire.\n\nDuring World War II, Lord Deramore served as a pilot in the RAFVR, flying low-level reconnaissance missions in the Mediterranean. After the war, he returned to his architectural practice, but also pursued other interests.  He designed his own home, to replace the family seat at Heslington Hall.  The Hall had been taken over by the RAF in the war and remained unoccupied afterwards, until it was sold to become the headquarters of the University of York in 1962.\nHe married Janet Ware in 1948, and their only child, a daughter, was born in 1950.  In 1964, he became the 6th Baron Deramore and 7th Baronet upon the death of his elder brother, the 5th Baron Deramore.\nDetermined to pursue a career as a writer, he collected many rejection letters before a short story, A Touch of Bird Lime, was published.  His first novel, Still Waters was published in 1997.\nHe lost his seat in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act 1999. Upon his death in 2006, aged 95, the barony and baronetcy became extinct.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heslington", "response": ["Heslington Hall was built between 1565 and 1568 for Sir Thomas Eynns.
