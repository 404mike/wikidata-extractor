From March 1844 the L&BR joined the scheme and their locomotives were operated by the Brighton, Croydon and Dover Joint Committee, which also ordered further locomotives. These pooling arrangements had the advantage of providing the L&BR with access to the South Eastern Railway repair facilities, at New Cross but caused great operating problems.
