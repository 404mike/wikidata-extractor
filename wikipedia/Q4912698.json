Wanderers dominated the 2nd half and were 5-1 up with 2 minutes left to play. However, Siddons struck Albion forward, Billy Hendry with his fist which caused a fight. Some of the crowd came onto the pitch and joined in. The referee and club officials were able to restore order without using the local Police service. The match was ended and Wanderers were given the win. Siddons was suspended by the Football Association for a month and never played top flight football again. Bolton finished the season in 5th place. (registration & fee required)"]}, {"page": "1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain", "response": ["*Billy Hendry"]}]}}
