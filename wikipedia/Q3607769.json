In spite of the possibility to continue his studies with either Professor Francisco Fari\u00f1a or Professor Jes\u00fas Morcillo in Madrid he moved to France. After a fruitless attempt to become a perfumist, Professor Robert Jacquier at the University of Montpellier accepted him as a PhD student (PhD, 1961). He also received a Doctorate of Science by the University Complutense of Madrid (1977). He was appointed \u201cAttach\u00e9 de Recherche\u201d and promoted to \u201cMa\u00eetre de Recherche\u201d at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) first in Montpellier and later at the laboratory of Professor Jacques Metzger in Marseille where he worked until 1979. He was visitor at Prof. Alan R. Katritzky laboratory in England. After more than 20 years of research in France he returned in 1980 to Spain to hold a Research Professor position at the Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) in Madrid where he has continued his career. He was appointed Honorary Research Professor in 2005. He has served as President of CSIC (1983\u20131984), President of the Social Council of the Autonomous University of Madrid (1986\u20131990), President of the Scientific Advisory Board of Comunidad de Madrid (1990\u20131995) and President of the Forum Foro Permanente Qu\u00edmica y Sociedad (2008\u20132010).
