Around five minutes after the interval, a corner kick to the Etonians led to a \"scrimmage\" (a term in common use at the time to describe a group of players struggling to gain possession of the ball) in front of their opponents' goal, which resulted in the ball and a number of players being forced over the goal-line, uprooting the goalposts in the process.
