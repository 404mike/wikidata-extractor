His work, in the 1840s on photomechanical reproduction, led to the creation of the photoglyphic engraving process, the precursor to photogravure. He was the holder of a controversial patent that affected the early development of commercial photography in Britain. He was also a noted photographer who contributed to the development of photography as an artistic medium. He published The Pencil of Nature (1844\u201346), which was illustrated with original salted paper prints from his calotype negatives, and made some important early photographs of Oxford, Paris, Reading, and York.Hugh Murray, Nathaniel Whittock's bird's-eye view of the City of York in the 1850s"]}, {"page": "Sherborne School", "response": ["File:Sherborne-school-headmasters-house-nathaniel-whittock.jpg|The school room and headmaster's house by Nathaniel Whittock (1791\u20131860)"]}, {"page": "Whittock", "response": ["* Nathaniel Whittock (1791\u20131860), British engraver"]}, {"page": "Charles Cox (brewer)", "response": ["In 1709 he began to offer German Protestant refugees from the Palatinate (\"Palatines\") living space in his warehouses.
