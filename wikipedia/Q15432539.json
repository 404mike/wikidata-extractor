After studying chemistry, Steele was for a brief time a teacher of this subject at Bedford School. He soon abandoned this job and moved to London where he worked as a freelance journalist, writing for various literary and socialist publications. He became a member of the Fabian Society.One of his early works, with a preface by Morris, was Mediaeval lore from Bartholomew Anglicus, a selective modernization of a medieval encyclopedia, edited\u2014according to George Bernard Shaw's review\u2014\"with a nice sense of how much modern readers are likely to stand.\" Steele's first major work on medieval manuscripts was The Earliest English Arithmetics, published with the help of the Early English Text Society. Later he published Early English Music Printing with the Bibliographical Society. He was able to visit France, Italy, and Russia; the latter visit helped him write The Art of the Russian Icon published with the Medici Society.His publications of Bacon's works attracted funding from several learned societies, as well as a Civil List Pension and an Honorary Doctorate from Durham University. He was also one of the early Executive Members of the International Academy of the History of Science. His house and personal library were destroyed in a German air raid in 1941. He had ten children.Steele's edition of Bacon's Secretum secretorum, with its lengthy introduction and numerous notes, is seen as the modern basis for its study by English scholars. However, Steele's view that Bacon's reading of the Secretum was the turning point towards experimentalism in Bacon's philosophy is viewed with skepticism by later scholars like S.J. Williams, who nonetheless acknowledge the special place that the Secretum played in Bacon's own writings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roger Bacon", "response": ["Bacon attributed the Secret of Secrets (), the Islamic \"Mirror of Princes\" (), to Aristotle, thinking that he had composed it for Alexander the Great. Bacon produced an edition of Philip of Tripoli's Latin translation, complete with his own introduction and notes; and his writings of the 1260s and 1270s cite it far more than his contemporaries did. This led Easton and others, including Robert Steele, to argue that the text spurred Bacon's own transformation into an experimentalist. (Bacon never described such a decisive impact himself.) The dating of Bacon's edition of the Secret of Secrets is a key piece of evidence in the debate, with those arguing for a greater impact giving it an earlier date; but it certainly influenced the elder Bacon's conception of the political aspects of his work in the sciences."]}, {"page": "William Morris", "response": ["* Robert Steele \u2013 medievalist who was a disciple of Morris"]}, {"page": "Bartholomeus Anglicus", "response": ["The original Latin work was translated into French in 1372 and a number of manuscripts of the Latin and French versions survive.

The passage reads: \"We have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e., a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpeter [together with sulfur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning.\" In the early 20th century, British artillery officer Henry William Lovett Hime proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. This claim has been disputed by historians of science including Lynn Thorndike, John Maxson Stillman and George Sarton and by Bacon's editor Robert Steele, both in terms of authenticity of the work, and with respect to the decryption method. In any case, the formula claimed to have been decrypted (7:5:5 saltpeter:charcoal:sulfur) is not useful for firearms use or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke. However, if Bacon's recipe is taken as measurements by volume rather than weight, a far more potent and serviceable explosive powder is created suitable for firing hand-cannons, albeit less consistent due to the inherent inaccuracies of measurements by volume. One example of this composition resulted in 100 parts saltpeter, 27 parts charcoal, and 45 parts sulfur, by weight."]}, {"page": "Robert Steele", "response": ["Robert Steele may refer to:", "*Robert Steele (drum major) (1760\u20131833), American Revolutionary War drummer and drum major", "*Robert Steele (medievalist) (1860\u20131944), editor of the works of Roger Bacon", "*Robert Steele (politician) (1961\u20132017), commissioner of Cook County, Illinois", "*Robert Steele (sailor) (1893-1969), British Olympic sailor", "*Robert Steele (Pitt Principal), principal of the University of Pittsburgh, 1800\u20131801", "*Robert Steele (American football) (born 1956), former NFL wide receiver", "*Robert Steele, (1745\u20131830) Scottish shipbuilder, founder of Robert Steele & Company, 1815"]}, {"page": "Robert Steele (scholar)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Steele (medievalist)"]}, {"page": "House of de Vere", "response": ["*Guy of Valence (fl. 1230s), supposed by Robert Steele, probably mistakenly, to have been a de Vere"]}, {"page": "Russian Fairy Tales (disambiguation)", "response": ["*The Russian Garland of Fairy Tales, (1916) unattributed translations by Robert Steele"]}, {"page": "List of English translations from medieval sources: B", "response": ["* Medi\u00e6val lore from Bartholomaeus Anglicus (1893).Bartholomaeus, A., Steele, R.
