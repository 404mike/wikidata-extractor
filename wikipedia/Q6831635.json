As inventors they form a slightly barmy double act in their felt hats and tweed suits. Amelia gives us the love interest with her devoted husband George Putnam (Ian Bartholomew) torn between letting her achieve her ambition and knowing that with the risks she takes, he may lose her. Charles Lindbergh is this curiosity, a solo pilot and seemingly a loner which, in Michael Jibson's remarkable soulful portrayal, gives the audience a sense of the isolation of those long solo flights...The performances are flawless and the singing is superb... It is rather engaging to have a musical which has a theme one can engage with intellectually. I think given some investment, Take Flight could continue its journey elsewhere, but it is still a work in progress.\"", "* Best Supporting Actor in a Musical - Michael Jibson \u2014 nominee"]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical", "response": ["| Michael Jibson"]}, {"page": "Caroline Sheen", "response": ["Born and raised in South Wales, Sheen is married to actor Michael Jibson.
