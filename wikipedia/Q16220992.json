It is a collection of diary entries written by Kay during his medical training from 2004 to 2010. Kay's book discusses political issues in the health care system of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom and societal conflicts between the general population and neglected doctors. Kay accomplishes this by incorporating humour into his personal anecdotes that depict his life as he progresses through his medical training, and his eventual resignation from this career.", "This is Going to Hurt is mostly composed of diary entries Adam Kay wrote during his medical training under the National Health Service. It was recommended to Kay to write this diary as a \"reflective practice\" in which he could log any interesting clinical experiences he experienced throughout his training. Five years after his resignation, Kay was officially removed from the medical register which prompted him to dispose of all the medical files he had been storing, leading him to review his reflective journal. Around this time in 2015, junior doctors entered contract disputes with the NHS leading the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Jeremy Hunt, to accuse junior doctors of being greedy. This event motivated Kay to respond to this accusation by releasing This is Going to Hurt, which illustrates his own experiences as a junior doctor.", "thumb|Adam Kay", "The most prevalent theme present in This is Going to Hurt is the mistreatment and neglect that doctors have to endure. Throughout his time working for the NHS, Adam Kay was deprived of multiple basic amenities that other occupations have. Kay was forced to stay hours after his shift would end with no pay, be unable to have a sick day or go on holiday because it was extremely difficult to find someone to cover his shift; while on shift, he would be unable to sleep even if he had free time; and, in general, junior doctors like Kay felt severely underpaid for their services. This sense of neglect was emphasised after Kay's career-ending event since he wasn't allowed to take any time off to emotionally recover. The next day he was forced to go back to work even though he wasn't in the right mindset to and had asked for a week off. No therapy was offered to Kay to possibly help him after the traumatic event, further debilitating his emotions and mind.", "Upon its release in September 2017, This is Going to Hurt was widely lauded for the infusion of comedy it had while also spreading awareness of the lives of junior doctors. A large portion of the general population was surprised to learn the inside scoop of the life of a junior doctor, all the ups and downs they experience, and were pleased to find out that Adam Kay accomplished this task while still maintaining his typical humour throughout most of the book. This combination was applauded by The Scotsman by stating the book \"will make your eyes water... and it may well make you choke on hot tea.\" The social importance of the book is stressed later on in the review as being \"vital and timely; it should be required reading for anyone who ever has any political or financial responsibility for [England's] health services.\" The Daily Express called the book \"hilarious, horrifying, and a heartbreaking insight into the life of a junior doctor.\"", "Shortly after its release in September 2017, Naomi De Pear of Sister Pictures acquired the television rights to This is Going to Hurt.
