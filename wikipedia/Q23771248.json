He made his professional debut for Colchester in March 2016, and has represented the Republic of Ireland at under-15, under-17 and under-18 levels. He had his first spell away from Colchester on loan with National League South side Concord Rangers in 2017. He then joined Farnborough on loan in January 2020. He was released by Colchester in July 2020.\nPrior to the 2020\u201321 campaign, Dunne returned to Farnborough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2015\u201316 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["January started on a better note for Colchester, earning a 1\u20131 draw away to Oldham Athletic on 2 January 2016 which moved them off the foot of the table. Rhys Murphy opened the scoring for Oldham after just five minutes, but a late Chris Porter strike against his former club ensured Colchester could not earn an unwanted record of ten consecutive league defeats. Keen's first transfer movements of the January window occurred on 5 January, with Dan Holman allowed to leave the club on a free transfer, joining National League leaders Cheltenham Town. He made his first signing of the transfer window on 7 January, bringing in Norwich City's reserve goalkeeper Jake Kean on an initial 28-day loan deal. Meanwhile, youth-team member Marley Andrews was loaned out to Steve Ball's Maldon & Tiptree for one month. The club tied down the promising Louis Dunne, son of former U's manager and player Joe Dunne, to a three-year development contract on 14 January.", "Colchester fell back into familiar ways with a 2\u20130 away defeat at Port Vale on 5 March. A goal in either half ensured the U's remained bottom of the table. Keen was moments away from picking up a second league win on 12 March at home to Wigan Athletic but for a last minute equaliser from Will Grigg. Handing a professional debut to Femi Akinwande, Keen's Colchester side fell behind to Wigan on 36-minutes when Yanic Wildschut scored, but four minutes later, Alex Gilbey equalised with a long-range strike. The U's went into half-time 2\u20131 down, conceding one minute before the interval to a Ryan Colclough goal who had already scored for Crewe against Colchester earlier in the season. Elliot Lee scored his first goal in his second spell with the club to level the score at 2\u20132 on 50-minutes, and ten minutes later George Moncur scored for the first time in two-months from the penalty spot after being fouled by Reece Wabara. Louis Dunne replaced Lee to make his professional debut after 77-minutes before Grigg scored the late equaliser.", "A late Crewe equaliser denied the U's the opportunity to close the gap on the teams above them in the table on 19 April. Having led 1\u20130 since the 65th-minute when George Moncur converted a penalty, Crewe scored through a Callum Saunders header in the first minute of second-half stoppage time. Their fate was finally sealed on 23 April when they were beaten 3\u20130 at home to promotion hopefuls Burton, spelling a return to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in 18-years. Kevin Keen dropped Alex Gilbey and George Moncur from the starting eleven, preferring Louis Dunne in midfield who made his first senior start. The match got off to a bad start for the U's when Joe Edwards was sent off for a challenge on Matt Palmer in only the 17th-minute, before falling behind to the first of three Lucas Akins goals on the stroke of half-time. It took him just four minutes after the restart to score his second, and the game was effectively over on the hour mark when he scored his third. Edwards' red card was later rescinded on 26 April.", "| Louis Dunne", "| Louis Dunne"]}, {"page": "Colchester United F.C.
