Most notable of these was John McCulloch McPhedran, who wrote regularly in the British Bee Journal as 'The Renfrewshire Beekeeper'. More recently, Dr. Eva Crane has summarised information, although, as with many aspects of bee keeping history, detail appears to have been overlooked, and a few 'modern myths' have been allowed to develop. Dr. Crane correctly asserts that the Stewarton \"kept the queen out of the honey boxes\" thus allowing the beekeeper to secure a crop of honey free from contamination from brood. However, the Stewarton hive was apparently the first to allow unlimited expansion simply by adding extra boxes.", "Eva Crane  relegates John Evelyn's hive to her chapter on the history of observation hives. Obviously, any 'transparent' hive with glass windows or sides allows observation of the bees without opening the hive, but the Stewarton hive uses windows at the front and back as part of the system for managing the hives. Put simply, with the sliders inserted in the central portion of the box at the top of the brood nest, thus inhibiting the queen from laying above,the withdrawal of the sliders to the sides allows workers to begin drawing comb and storing honey at the sides of the honey box above. As the nectar flow proceeds, and more honey is stored this comb is built from both sides towards the centre. The beekeeper can establish whether the bees require more space by opening the windows. If light can be seen, comb building in that box is not finished and no super is required. If the view through the windows is obscured by comb and bees, then that box is nearly full and a new box can be added above."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2007", "response": ["*Eva Crane, 95, British bee expert."]}, {"page": "Eva crane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eva Crane "]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Eva Crane \u2013 mathematician and physicist who became world expert on bees"]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Eva Crane (1912\u20132007), entomologist"]}, {"page": "June 1912", "response": ["** Eva Crane, English mathematician and biologist, noted for her research into bee behavior, in London (d. 2007)"]}, {"page": "Ahmed Zaki Abu Shadi", "response": ["Abu Shadi lived in England from 1912 to 1922.
