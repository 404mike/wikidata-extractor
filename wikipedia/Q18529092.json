She first married Thomas Smith sometime before 1604, an English judge who died in November 1609. The following year, in late 1610, she married Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, despite being 40 years his junior, younger than most of the earl's children. Poet Ben Jonson praised the marriage in his Gipsies Metamorphos'd (1621), writing \"An old man's wife is the light of his life\". During the earl's lifetime, Frances enjoyed great prestige in the English court.The court physician Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne treated her for melancholy in November 1614.After a serious illness contracted in late 1622, Thomas died in February 1623. Widowed again, Frances devoted herself to getting her daughter, Margaret, a husband, settling on MP Thomas Carey. In the 1630s, the countess had her portrait painted by Anthony van Dyck. This portrait was lost in the 19th century, surviving in engraved and drawn copies. Frances lived another 30 years, as her daughter was widowed and remarried to Edward Herbert. Cecil died in 1663, between 20 January and 17 July, when her will was signed and probated, respectively. Thomas Cecil reserved a space for her in his monument at Westminster Abbey, but Frances chose instead to have her grave in the floor of Winchester Cathedral.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Burton", "response": ["In 1624, Lady Frances Cecil, dowager Countess of Exeter presented Burton to the Lincolnshire benefice of Walesby. Burton was perhaps the tutor of Frances' son, Robert Smith. Burton chose not to reside in Walesby, though he probably visited it at some point. He took little interest in the daily affairs of the parish\u2014all the parish records were signed by his curate, Thomas Benson\u2014but did win for it nine acres of land which had been taken by Frances's predecessor. Burton resigned from this post in 1631. In the 1632 edition of the Anatomy, appended below a mention of his Walesby appointment, Burton tersely added: \"Lately resigned for some special reasons\". After his resignation, Lady Frances temporarily turned over the duty to appoint Burton's successor to her friend, the first Earl of Middlesex, suggesting that Burton resigned over Middlesex's pressure to appoint his own favourite."]}, {"page": "Countess of Exeter", "response": ["*Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (died 1663) (; 1580\u20131663) (2nd wife of 1st Earl)", "*Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (died 1669) (; 1630-1669) (1st wife of the 4th Earl)"]}, {"page": "Frances Brydges", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (died 1663)"]}, {"page": "Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter", "response": ["Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter may refer to: ", "* Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (died 1663) (1580\u20131663), English noblewoman, wife of Thomas Smith (English judge) and Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter", "* Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (died 1669) (1630\u20131669), English noblewoman, wife of John Cecil, 4th Earl of Exeter"]}, {"page": "Frances Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (died 1663)"]}]}}
