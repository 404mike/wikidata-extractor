She was born in Cork, but grew up in Lancashire, England. Voynich was a significant figure, not only on the late Victorian literary scene, but also in Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles. She is best known for her novel The Gadfly, which became hugely popular in her lifetime, especially in Russia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sidney Reilly", "response": ["In 1895, Reilly encountered author Ethel Lilian Voynich, n\u00e9e Boole. Boole was a well-known figure in the late Victorian literary scene and later married to Polish revolutionary Wilfrid Voynich. She and Reilly had a sexual liaison in Italy together. During their affair, Reilly supposedly \"bared his soul\" to Ethel and revealed to her the peculiar story of his revolutionary past in the Russian Empire. After their affair had concluded, Voynich published in 1897 The Gadfly, a critically acclaimed novel whose central character is allegedly based on Reilly's early life. Alternatively, Reilly modelled himself on the hero of Voynich's novel, Giuseppe Mazzini, although historian Mark Mazower observed \"separating fact from fantasy in the case of Reilly is difficult\". For years, the existence of this purported relationship was doubted by sceptical historians until confirmed by new evidence in 2016. Archived communication between Anne Fremantle \u2014 who attempted a biography of Ethel Voynich \u2014 and a relative of Ethel's on the Hinton side demonstrates that a liaison did occur. The theme music for the 1983 television mini-series is essentially a piece of The Gadfly Suite (Op. 97a) by Dmitri Shostakovich."]}, {"page": "William H.
