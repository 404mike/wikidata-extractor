He started his career working at the Irn Bru factory in Scotland before becoming a live sound engineer, before building his own recording studio called 'The Irn Bru Hit Factory' in Glasgow in 1986.   His most notable productions are for Glasgow indie band The Orchids, before he started his own band, One Dove, in 1991, with their highly influential album release, Morning Dove White in 1993. When One Dove split in 1995, Carmichael went on to work with Manchester band Lamb, with recording and mixing credits on both Fear of Fours and What Sound.  He also produced and remixed for iconic Glasgow shoegazers The Pastels on their albums Mobile Safari (1995), Illumination (1997), and Illuminati (1998), as well as Bis (\"Detour\" single), and Manchester garage band, Un-Cut. Currently, Carmichael teaches sound engineering and music production at SSR in Manchester, he has cited Irn Bru as his soft drink of choice during lectures and has recently reunited with The Orchids to remix tracks from their recent 2007 album, Good to Be a Stranger.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Orchids", "response": ["The Orchids are a Scottish band that achieved success with Sarah Records.  Formed in Penilee in Glasgow in 1985, the Orchids released a series of underground singles on Sarah Records. The group's line-up comprised James Hackett (vocals), Pauline Hynds Bari (vocals), John Scally (guitar), Chris Quinn (drums), Matthew Drummond (guitar) and James Moody (bass). Their producer, Ian Carmichael, often played keyboards on their records. They changed their line up in 1993, when bassist James Moody left and Ronnie Borland, a long time collaborator and supporter of the band, took over on bass. They went quiet after their 1994 album release, their last on Sarah Records, only surfacing in 1995 to play at the Sarah Records farewell party. After that they took a break until 2004 when they got back together.", "Starting with a melancholy guitar pop sound on Lyceum and contemporaneous singles, they moved on to become more keyboard and sample/effects-based for their second and third albums, Unholy Soul and Striving For the Lazy Perfection, developing a more electronic sound, possibly as a result of their producer, Ian Carmichael, who was a member of dance band One Dove.", "Their entire back catalogue was re-released on CD on LTM in 2005. In 2007, they released their fourth album, Good to Be a Stranger. The album was issued on Madrid based label Siesta, with the band playing live gigs for the first time in eleven years. In 2010, the group released a fifth album, The Lost Star, through Pebble Records, mixed by a returning Ian Carmichael. In October 2014, they released their sixth album, Beatitude#9, on another Spanish record label Acurela."]}, {"page": "Fear of Fours", "response": ["* Ian Carmichael \u2013 engineering, mixing (tracks 6, 10, 13)"]}, {"page": "One Dove", "response": ["One Dove were a Scottish electronic music group active in the early 1990s, consisting of Dot Allison, Ian Carmichael and Jim McKinven, a former member of Berlin Blondes and Altered Images."]}, {"page": "Morning Dove White", "response": ["In a retrospective review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic wrote that \"Dot Allison's singing, informed with everything from Siouxsie Sioux's cool clip to Dolly Parton's rich passion ... is simply marvelous, while the blend of influences in the musicians' work ranges as well from dub's deep echo to epic metal noise.\" In 2017, Mixmag included the album on its list of \"10 Slept-On Albums That Should Have Been Absolutely Huge\".
