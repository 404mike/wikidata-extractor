If, however, blood was principally on his hands, the presence of so many slaughterhouses in the neighbourhood would make the frequenters of this spot familiar with bloodstained clothes and hands, and his appearance might in that way have failed to attract attention while he passed from Buck's Row in the twilight into Whitechapel Road, and was lost sight of in the morning's market traffic.\" Baxter further referenced the two earlier Whitechapel murders and the 8 September murder of Annie Chapman, informing the jury: \"We cannot altogether leave unnoticed the fact that the death that you have been investigating is one of four presenting many points of similarity, all of which have occurred within the space of about five months, and all within a very short distance of the place where we are sitting. All four victims were women of middle age, all were married, and had lived apart from their husbands in consequence of intemperate habits, and were at the time of their death leading an irregular life.\"", "Referencing the direct similarities between Nichols's murder and the murder of Annie Chapman as opposed to the earlier murders of Emma Smith and Martha Tabram, Baxter elaborated: \"The similarity of the injuries in the [murders of Nichols and Chapman] is considerable.

The couple settled in Jersey City, New Jersey, where Klosowski found work in a barbershop, but often fought bitterly. In February 1892, after Klosowski had attacked Lucie while she was pregnant and later told her he had intended to kill her and cover up her murder, she returned to London, where she moved in with her sister and gave birth to a daughter. Klosowski himself eventually returned to London, and the two reunited for a while before ending their relationship permanently. In 1893, while working as an assistant in Haddin's hairdresser shop, he met a woman named Annie Chapman (no known relation to the Ripper victim). They began a relationship, moved in together and he took her surname, thereafter being known as George Chapman. In 1894, after almost a year of cohabiting, Chapman brought another woman to live with them, and Annie, who was pregnant, left a few weeks later. In early 1895, Annie told Chapman about their baby, but he offered no support.

Abberline thought Chapman was the Ripper because during the original investigation, he had closely interviewed Chapman's first \"wife\", Lucie Badewski, and she had told him that her husband often used to go out during the night for hours on end. Speculation in contemporary newspaper accounts and books has led to Chapman, like fellow serial killer Thomas Neill Cream, becoming one of many suspects in the infamous Ripper murders.
