By the time of his death in 1837, Burton had built over 3000 properties, and his buildings covered over 250 acres of central London. His imperative contribution to the development of the West End has been acknowledged by James Manwaring Baines, John Summerson, and Dana Arnold. Steen Eiler Rasmussen, in London: The Unique City, commended Burton's buildings, but did not identify their architect. The 21st century Oxford Dictionary of National Biography contends that Burton was 'the most successful developer in late Georgian London, responsible for some of its most characteristic architecture'.\nJames built the majority of the Bloomsbury district (including Bedford Square, Russell Square, Bloomsbury Square, Tavistock Square, and Cartwright Gardens); St John's Wood; Regent Street; Regent Street St. James; Waterloo Place, St. James's; Swallow Street; Regent\u2019s Park (including the Inner Circle villas, Chester Terrace, Cornwall Terrace, Clarence Terrace, and York Terrace). James financed, patronized, and built the other projects of John Nash around Regent\u2019s Park  -  most of which were predominantly designed by James's son, Decimus Burton, rather than by Nash himself - to the extent that the Commissioners of Woods described James, not Nash, as \u2018the architect of Regent\u2019s Park\u2019. James also conceived, planned, and developed the town of St Leonards-on-Sea, which is now part of Hastings.\nJames was a leading member of London high society during the Georgian era and the Regency era. He was an early member of the Athenaeum Club, London, whose Clubhouse his company built to the design of his son Decimus Burton, who was the Club's 'prime member'. James was a close friend of Princess Victoria (the future Queen Victoria), and with the Duchess of Kent. He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers, and Sheriff of Kent. James was the father of William Ford Burton, the gunpowder manufacturer; of James Burton, the Egyptologist; of Henry Burton, the physician; and of Decimus Burton, the architect; amongst others; and the grandfather of Henry Marley Burton, the architect, and of Constance Mary Fearon, the founder of the Francis Bacon Society.\nThe Burton family mansion, The Holme in Regent's Park, which was built by James's company to a design by his son Decimus Burton, was described by 20th century architectural critic Ian Nairn as 'a definition of Western civilization in a single view'.", "link_mentions": {}}}
