His catchphrase was 'Pin back your lugholes'. He was best known for his \"Odd Odes\", which later formed a section of the television show That's Life!, a role for which he was approached in error. So successful was he however, that he stayed on the show from 1973 to 1981. He first began performing the Odd Odes in 1937, long before they first appeared on television (though he did appear on pre World War II television).Fletcher came up with the idea when he was short of material for a radio show. The first, Odd Ode, was a comic, yet sentimental, reading of Edgar Wallace's war poem Dreamin' of Thee. Following this broadcast, he was given a regular programme on Radio Luxembourg; it was this show that brought him to national attention. He called himself \"the odd oder\".He also appeared as a panellist on the popular panel show on BBC, What's My Line?, that ran from 1951 to 1963. He was the presenter of Central TV's Gardening Today for fourteen years, and Channel Television's Cyril Fletcher's TV Garden, and ran from 1990 to 1992, for two years. He alleged defamation when Rowan Atkinson referred to him, in a Not The Nine O\u2019Clock News sketch as \u201ca cross eyed baboon\u201d. Boss eyed, Fletcher considered litigation but over time they became friends.\nFletcher was born in Watford, the son of a solicitor, who was the Friern Barnet town clerk. Following schooling at Woodhouse School, North Finchley, where he first began to entertain by composing witty poems about his schoolmasters, he graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. \nA Freemason and a successful businessman, he believed it important to diversify in such a fickle business as show business. He founded Associated Speakers, an agency for after-dinner speakers, on whose books were included The Duke of Bedford and Lord Longford, as well as himself.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cyril", "response": ["* Cyril Fletcher (1913\u20132005), English comedian, actor and businessman"]}, {"page": "June 25", "response": ["*1913 \u2013 Cyril Fletcher, English actor and screenwriter (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "1913", "response": ["* June 25 \u2013 Cyril Fletcher, British comedian (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Cyril Fletcher (1913\u20132005)", "*Cyril Fletcher (1913\u20132005)", "*Cyril Fletcher (1913\u20132005)"]}, {"page": "Ted Ray (comedian)", "response": ["Ray was an accomplished golfer, frequently playing with professional sportsmen.

To increase earnings, in 1935 Fred Cavendish-Bentinck recommended that the hotel commence putting on a Cabaret show. Advertised in the Evening Standard, the programme was an immediate success. In January 1936, Austrian comedian Vic Oliver was one of the entertainers hired to perform at the hotel for two weeks, and Cyril Fletcher appeared in the show for a month the following year. The BBC began broadcasting live performances from the restaurant of the hotel, with pianist Billy Milton and others. It was through the show that the Irving Berlin song \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" grew in popularity, performed by Joe Kaye's Dance Band. In 1937, James Stephens shortly succeeded Lurgan as director of the Ritz before being replaced by Hans Pfyffer von Altishofen, who had been on the board of the Ritz Hotel Development Company from 1910 and was also the chairman of the Paris Ritz."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2005", "response": ["*Cyril Fletcher, 91, British comedian (That's Life!)."]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Cyril Fletcher, comedian (born 1913)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2005", "response": ["*Betty Astell, 93, American actress, entertainer and widow of Cyril Fletcher."]}, {"page": "Betty Astell", "response": ["Betty Astell (23 May 1912 \u2013 26 July 2005), born Betty Julia Hymans, was an English actress, best known for comedy and pantomime productions on stage, screen, and radio with her husband, Cyril Fletcher.
