He played regularly for the youth team there, but was frustrated by a lack of first team chances, so he moved to Walton & Hersham, before moving to Bristol Rovers in February 1999 for \u00a3150,000. He made his professional debut on 23 February 1999, coming on as a second-half substitute for Jamie Cureton in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Gillingham. He came off the bench to score his first goal on 6 March 1999, helping his team to a 2\u20130 win over York City. He found a growing reputation with the side, and his highest point for Rovers was scoring a hat-trick in a 3\u20131 win against Premier League side Derby County in the FA Cup, on 6 January 2002. This was the first time a team from the Third Division had beaten a Premier League team in the FA Cup.

However, an injured Forster was unable to contribute to the club's good fortune the following season. However, he did return in time for the 2000\u201301 Division Two play-off semi final against Wigan Athletic. In the second leg with Wigan leading 1\u20130 on aggregate, Forster came on as a late substitute. He set up Martin Butler for the equaliser before winning a penalty; after Jamie Cureton's effort was saved, Forster scored from the rebound.
