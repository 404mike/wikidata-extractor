Tony Adcock squeezed the ball in past Carlisle goalkeeper Tony Caig who had dived the right way. Carl Emberson saved Owen Archdeacon's penalty kick, before David Greene gave his side a 3\u20131 advantage. Dean Walling then scored for Carlisle as Colchester substitute Karl Duguid stepped up to take his penalty. His effort was tipped onto the post by Caig and saved, a moment which saw a young Duguid break down into tears. Warren Aspinall levelled the score at 3\u20133 with the next kick for Carlisle.
