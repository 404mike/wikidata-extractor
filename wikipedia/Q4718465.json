He was born in Findochty, Scotland.\nHe studied at the Glasgow School of Art (where he later taught) and was apprenticed to the firm of Gillespie, Kidd and Coia. \nOne of Buchanan Campbell's most notable works was the Dollan Baths complex in East Kilbride (opened 1968 and named after former Lord Provost Sir Patrick Dollan). Influenced by the Beaux-Arts style, his time with Coia and works of Pier Luigi Nervi and Kenzo Tange, the significance of Buchanan Campbell's Dollan Baths was recognised when Historic Scotland listed it as Category A in 2002.\nOther significant work includes Craigie College, Ayr and alterations to Gillespie, Kidd and Coia's Notre Dame College in Bearsden, Glasgow.\nIn 1995 Buchanan Campbell gifted his papers to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.\nHe was married to Sheila (Neville- Smith) Campbell, they had one daughter, Alexis Louise Leech, and one son, Euan Buchanan Campbell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Alexander Buchanan Campbell (1914\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Campbell", "response": ["*Alexander Buchanan Campbell (1914\u20132007), Scottish architect"]}, {"page": "Dollan Baths", "response": ["Designed by Alexander Buchanan Campbell and named after former Lord Provost Sir Patrick Dollan, it was opened in 1968 as Scotland's first 50-metre (although not Olympic standard) swimming pool.
