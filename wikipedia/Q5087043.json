The governing body since 1878 had been the National Cyclists Union (NCU).The NCU took over control of cycling from the Amateur Athletics Association. It was originally called the Bicycle Union. It became the NCU in 1883. The legality of cyclists on the road had not been established and the NCU worried that all cycling could be affected by police concerns about racing. The cycling historian Bernard Thompson said: \"Events organised by clubs in the 2234, although taking place on quiet country roads, were constantly interrupted by the police. Often horse-mounted policemen charged at racers and threw sticks into their wheels.\"Alpaca to Skinsuit, Bernard Thompson, Geerings of Ashford, UK,  The race organiser and writer, Chas Messenger, said: \"Thousands of cyclists were convicted or fined for dangerous riding, many on mere suspicion and unsupported evidence.\"Messenger, Chas (1998).

Harpenden: Pedal Publishing. , p2", "Infighting was sparked by the UCI's decision that world road championships from 1933 would be not individual contests but competitions in which riders started together. The NCU had never been against such races but insisted that in Britain they were on roads closed to traffic, such as airfields and motor-racing courses. It now had to select riders not on their talent against the clock but in a bunch. Selection races were held at Donington Park and Brooklands. Among the riders were some, like Percy Stallard, who believed races ought to be run on the open road.
