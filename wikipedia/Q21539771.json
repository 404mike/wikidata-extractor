One such concert, in 1906, of works by J. S. Bach, Purcell, William Boyce, Domenico Scarlatti and others, took place in the Broadwood Rooms in London.

They sometimes played on early instruments: Kate Chaplin played a viola d'amore (named \"The Dragon\") made by George Saint-George in 1899, and Mabel Chaplin played a viola da gamba."]}]}}
