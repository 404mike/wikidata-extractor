Although Davies was never selected to play for Wales again he was chosen to represent the British Lions in their 1924 tour of South Africa. The 1924 tour was notorious for the amount of injuries suffered by the tourists, and Davies was called out at the late in the tour as a replacement.Griffiths (1987), pg 9:6.

After the end of World War I he joined Llanelli a first class team within Welsh club rugby.

Whatever the reason for his leaving Llanelli, Hiddlestone was accepted to play for Neath.

The Welsh team he joined had many new caps, including Swansea's Islwyn Evans and Frank Palmer, Bridgend's Bobby Delahay and William Cummins from Treorchy. Led by Tom Parker, Wales overran the English team, scoring a record eight tries against England; Hiddlestone himself not only scored one of the tries, but is also credited as being the central linchpin in the Welsh attack that won the game so comfortably.Smith (1980), pg 205."]}, {"page": "Cliff Richards (rugby union)", "response": ["Richards was first capped for Wales while playing first class rugby for Pontypool. His first international game was against England in the opening Welsh match of the 1922 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Tom Parker, Wales were convincing winners over a far more experienced England, running in eight tries, of which Richards scored one. The 1922 Wales Championship team, captained by Tom Parker, was noted for its stability, with only two changes throughout the entire campaign. Richards played in all four matches, though was initially dropped for the final match of the tournament against France. The selectors had originally chosen Frank Palmer and Harold Davies, but switched to Richards and Islwyn Evans, just minutes before kick-off, as they believed they would be better suited to the harder French sun-baked pitch.Godwin (1984), pg 138. At the end of the Championship, Wales won three games and drew the match against Scotland, lifting the tournament as out-right winners."]}, {"page": "Islwyn (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Islwyn Evans (1898\u20131974), Welsh rugby player"]}]}}
