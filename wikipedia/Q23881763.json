In 2014, Tighe started working on new material with bass player and vocalist Rio Goldhammer. Their self-released download of Revenge, and accompanying video, by Chalkman Video (also see Death Note & Bloodline videos), came as a surprise to most fans but was received well. Mick Mercer again rated the track highly, and the band signed almost immediately with Deadfall Management."]}, {"page": "Mick Reed", "response": ["After guitarist Tighe had set about reforming the band with vocalist Rio Goldhammer, recording a demo for Revenge in the process, it was announced that Reed would be returning to the fold full-time, introducing Donner to complete the lineup.
