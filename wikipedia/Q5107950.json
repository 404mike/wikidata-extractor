He was born in Newport on the Isle of Wight.\nHaving played for the Worcestershire Second XI since 2008, Russell made his full debut for Worcestershire in a List A match against the Unicorns in the 2010 Clydesdale Bank 40, claiming his maiden List A wicket when he dismissed Chris Murtagh.  He made a further appearance in that competition against Surrey.  Russell didn't feature for Worcestershire in the 2011 season. A notable appearance in the 2012 season saw Russell gain match figures of 6-72 in a drawn two-day tour match against South Africa - only days after England had only managed to take two wickets in a five-day test match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newport, Isle of Wight", "response": ["*Chris Russell (born 1989), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Russell (surname)", "response": ["* Chris Russell  (born 1989), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Chris Russell (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Russell"]}]}}
