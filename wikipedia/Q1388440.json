However, despite announcing his intention to fight for his first team place, he found himself on the sidelines for the first few months and found his playing time, coming from the substitute bench. On 3 December 2005, Strachan began to play Wallace at left-back position in place of Mo Camara and he started his first match in the position, starting the whole game, in a 3\u20131 win against Aberdeen. However, this turned out to be a strange selection given Wallace's slight build and inexperience of playing in a defensive role. Strachan persisted with this team selection for several weeks to the bemusement of fans who could clearly see the player's lack of aptitude for playing in defence. This further highlighted his lack of positional awareness in playing in defence when he scored an own goal in the New Year game against Hearts at Tynecastle, although the club still won 3\u20132 on 1 January 2006. Towards the end of the season, new signing Mark Wilson replaced him at left back even though it was not his natural position (Wilson is a right back). But Wallace played in the Scottish League Cup Final at a left back position against Dunfermline Athletic, due to Wilson being cup-tied and Celtic won 3\u20130. He later made two appearances later in the 2005\u201306 season and despite being dropped from the first team, his contributions saw the club win the league. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Wallace went on to make fourteen appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Celtic F.C. season", "response": ["| Mark Wilson ||  Dundee United || \u00a3500,000"]}, {"page": "Simon Donnelly", "response": ["He has since moved into coaching, acting as assistant manager to Jackie McNamara at Partick Thistle, Dundee United and York City, and Mark Wilson at Brechin City.", "In September 2020, Donnelly landed the assistant manager's job at Scottish side Brechin City, working with another former Celtic player, Mark Wilson.
