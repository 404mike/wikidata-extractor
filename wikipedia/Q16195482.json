His plays include My Arm, An Oak Tree, ENGLAND, and The Author. These take various forms, but all reject theatrical conventions, especially realism, and invite the audience to help create the work. Interviewed in 2007, Crouch said, \"Theatre in its purest form is a conceptual artform. It doesn't need sets, costumes and props, but exists inside an audience's head.\"Stephen Bottoms, Professor of Contemporary Theatre & Performance at the University of Manchester, has written that Crouch's plays \"make up one of the most important bodies of English-language playwriting to have emerged so far in the twenty-first century... I can think of no other contemporary playwright who has asked such a compelling set of questions about theatrical form, narrative content, and spectatorial engagement.\"Holly Williams, writing in The Independent in June 2014, says, \"Crouch has built a name for himself as one of British drama's great innovators, with plays that have disturbed and challenged the passive theatrical experience.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British playwrights", "response": ["*Tim Crouch"]}, {"page": "Helvius Cinna", "response": ["Cinna is a character in the chamber opera Le piccole storie: Ai margini delle guerre, written in 2007 by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.

The Guardian's theatre critic Lyn Gardner described the venue's significance under Wylie's direction:The Arches was one of the reasons that in recent years Glasgow has become a magnet for young performance-makers; many of those who forge careers there take the work on to festivals and theatres across the world. It is as significant as Battersea Arts Centre, in London, in the way it nurtures tomorrow.Between 2008 and 2015, The Arches developed a whole new generation of playwright-performers, including Rob Drummond, Kieran Hurley, Gary McNair and Julia Taudevin, and performance artists like Nic Green, Robert Softley Gale and Adrian Howells. Wylie commissioned and developed international touring multi-award-winning productions including Nic Green's Trilogy, Rob Drummond's Bullet Catch and Kieran Hurley's Beats. Drummond credits The Arches with allowing him to develop his work into a career in theatre. Having rebranded and redeveloped the nine-year-old Arches Theatre Festival into Behaviour, an internationally significant festival of contemporary performance which brought companies and artists like Mammalian Diving Reflex, Ontroerend Goed, Gob Squad, The TEAM, Ann Liv Young, Taylor Mac and Tim Crouch to Scotland, Wylie also co-commissioned performances such as DEREVO's Natura Morte, and Linder Sterling's 13 hour performance Darktown Cakewalk."]}, {"page": "Spymonkey", "response": ["In May 2016, Spymonkey staged The Complete Deaths, which previewed at the Royal & Derngate in Northampton and premiered at the Theatre Royal Brighton as part of the Brighton Festival. In the show, marking the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, they performed all 75 of the playwright's onstage deaths, down to the 'black ill-favoured fly' killed in Act III Scene 2 of Titus Andronicus . The company worked with a new director and writer, the conceptual theatre guru Tim Crouch, who is also based in Brighton. Reviewing the show in The Stage, Natasha Tripney wrote,'The pairing of Spymonkey with director Tim Crouch turns out to be inspired. The show contains moments of physical brilliance but also some equally entertaining repurposing of live art tropes....The best moments are when it manages to feel both like a Spymonkey show and a Tim Crouch production at the same time, a bloody marriage of slapstick and something more probing about the staging of death: the extinguishing of life and light. But it never entirely removes its tongue from its cheek; the production's main aim is to make its audience laugh, which it does, often. We laugh with them at death.'Natasha Tripney, The Complete Deaths review at Theatre Royal, Brighton \u2013 \u2018brilliantly ridiculous\u2019, The Stage, 12 May 2016"]}, {"page": "John Whiting Award", "response": ["|Tim Crouch||The Author "]}, {"page": "Stephen Dillane", "response": ["Offscreen, the actor in 2014 collaborated with visual artist Tacita Dean for the Sydney Biennale and Carriageworks in a project called Event for a Stage.
