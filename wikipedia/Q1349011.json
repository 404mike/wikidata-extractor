It was produced by ABC Television for three series, and Thames Television for a further four. The series depicted the cases and investigations handled by the enquiry agent Frank Marker (Alfred Burke), an unmarried loner who is in his early forties when the series begins. The title is a twist on the more usual \"private eye\".", "The series was created by writers Roger Marshall and Anthony Marriott with the aim of getting away from \"square-jawed\" heroes of the type featured in Hollywood movies\u2014a wish shared by Alfred Burke, the actor chosen to play Marker. This aim allowed for flexibility in the structure and plot lines of the episodes; each individual episode usually dealt with an individual case for Marker, but story arcs spanning several episodes, or in one case an entire series, were produced during the life of the programme. Marker's work ranged broadly, from routine matters such as gathering evidence for divorces (at a time when British law required evidence of infidelity or other compelling reason for annulling a marriage) or creditworthiness enquiries, to more exotic investigations such as tracing missing people (or in one case, a prize-winning whippet). Many of the narratives conclude with Marker leaving a situation as it was at the beginning of the episode\u2014for example, in \"The Man Who Didn't Eat Sweets\", he fails to tell his client that she is one of her husband's three wives.", "Thames had not wanted to end the series at this point. The intention was that Euston Films, Thames' film-making subsidiary, would continue with an eighth and final series but would make it on film, rather than the PAL 625-line video format which it had been recorded on up till then. This made sense as Euston had a good track record, having scored major successes with Van der Valk, their revamped version of Special Branch, and The Sweeney.  These were generally larger-scale, glossier and more 'action-packed' operations than the more intimate Public Eye. Alfred Burke, fearing that the move onto film would mean the series would lose its particular, low-key identity, decided not to take up the option.", "A small group of British Television enthusiasts, Kaleidoscope, did much to promote the programme and negotiated the rights to rescreen, at conventions and meetings, many of the black-and-white Thames episodes and the remaining ABC episodes. They also unearthed a 1968 ABC promotional reel, on a long-obsolete domestic videotape format, which included a five-minute extract from the otherwise-missing third series episode \"Must Be the Architecture, Can't Be the Climate\" and audio recordings of several lost ABC episodes. Most notably, Kaleidoscope organised and hosted a 'Public Eye: Thirtieth Anniversary' convention in 1995. This was attended by Alfred Burke in person.", "A 17-disc box set of every surviving episode, including a book on the making of the series by Andrew Pixley, plus interviews with Alfred Burke and surviving episode fragments and audio soundtracks, was released by Network Video in 2012.
