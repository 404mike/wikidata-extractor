From the 1930s to the 1960s, he wrote several important biographies and other works. Between 1964 and 1981 he edited five volumes of letters between Queen Victoria and the Princess Royal.

Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process.Hibbert, pp. 503\u2013504; St Aubyn, p. 30; Woodham-Smith, pp. 88, 436\u2013437 Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them.Hibbert, p. 503 Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A.

His children's governess, Lady Lyttelton, thought him unusually kind and patient, and described him joining in family games with enthusiasm.Lady Lyttelton's journal quoted in  and her correspondence quoted in . He felt keenly the departure of his eldest daughter for Prussia when she married her fianc\u00e9 at the beginning of 1858,; . and was disappointed that his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, did not respond well to the intense educational programme that Albert had designed for him.; . At the age of seven, the Prince of Wales was expected to take six hours of instruction, including an hour of German and an hour of French every day. When the Prince of Wales failed at his lessons, Albert caned him.Diary of Sir James Clark quoted in . Corporal punishment was common at the time, and was not thought unduly harsh. Albert's biographer Roger Fulford wrote that the relationships between the family members were \"friendly, affectionate and normal\u00a0... there is no evidence either in the Royal Archives or in the printed authorities to justify the belief that the relations between the Prince and his eldest son were other than deeply affectionate.\" Philip Magnus wrote in his biography of Albert's eldest son that Albert \"tried to treat his children as equals; and they were able to penetrate his stiffness and reserve because they realised instinctively not only that he loved them but that he enjoyed and needed their company.\"Magnus, Philip (1964) King Edward VII, pp. 19\u201320, quoted in .", "Biographies published after his death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin's five-volume magnum opus was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters.e.g. . Popular myths about Prince Albert\u2014such as the claim that he introduced Christmas trees to Britain\u2014are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers such as Stanley Weintraub portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 movie The Young Victoria, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into an heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet\u2014something that did not happen in real life."]}, {"page": "Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover", "response": ["Much of the public blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious explanations for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had played a part in the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke to the fact that he did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house and assumed the worst.", "On 20 June 1837, King William IV died; Victoria succeeded him as Queen of the United Kingdom, while Ernest Augustus became King of Hanover. On 28 June 1837, Ernest entered his new domain, passing under a triumphal arch. For the first time in over a century, Hanover would have a ruler living there. Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective and would have preferred the popular viceroy, the Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but both of Ernest's younger brothers refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. According to Roger Fulford in his study of George III's younger sons, Royal Dukes, \"In 1837, King Ernest was the only male descendant of George III who was willing and able to continue the connection with Hanover.\""]}, {"page": "Prince George, Duke of Cambridge", "response": ["It is believed, according to Roger Fulford, that William IV, who had been his godfather when Duke of Clarence, had George brought up at Windsor in hope of an eventual marriage to his cousin Princess Victoria of Kent, who was two months younger. This prospective match was favoured by George's own parents, but was forestalled by Victoria's maternal uncle Leopold I of Belgium. He secured Victoria's betrothal to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which became formal after she succeeded to the British throne. In 1839 Queen Victoria wrote to Albert about George's father: \"The Duke told Lord Melbourne he had always greatly desired our marriage, and never thought of George: but that I don't believe.\"  George was one of a range of suitors considered by Victoria, the most prominent of whom, Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, was openly favoured by William."]}, {"page": "Anthony Blunt", "response": ["Miranda Carter mentions that other versions of the story, which claim that the trip was to retrieve letters from the Duke of Windsor to Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, the owner of Friedrichshof, in which the Duke knowingly revealed Allied secrets to Hitler, have some credibility, given the Duke's known Nazi sympathies.Carter 2001, p. 312 (American edition). Variants of this version have been published by several authors.Martin Allen, Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies (London: Macmillan, 2000). . Carter allows that, while George VI may have also asked Blunt and Morshead to be on the alert for any documents relating to the Duke of Windsor, \"it seems unlikely that they found any.\"Carter 2001, p. 313 (American edition). Much later Queen Victoria's letters were edited and published in five volumes by Roger Fulford, and it was revealed they contained numerous \"embarrassing and 'improper' comments about the awfulness of German politics and culture.\" Hugh Trevor-Roper remembered discussing the trip with Blunt at MI5 in the autumn of 1945 and recalled (in Carter's retelling): \"Blunt's task had been to secure the Vicky correspondence before the Americans found it and published it.\"Carter 2001, pp. 313\u2013314 (American edition)."]}, {"page": "Old Men Forget", "response": ["Old Men Forget was well received by reviewers.
