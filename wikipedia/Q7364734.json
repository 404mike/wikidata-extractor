The constituency had been held comfortably by the Conservatives since its creation in 1885, but a landslide in favour of Labour saw Chamberlain elected Member of Parliament, overturning a Conservative majority of 12,456 to win the seat by 2,023 votes. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Town and Country Planning, Lewis Silkin.  Chamberlain was regarded as a \"maverick\" member on the left wing fringe of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was disciplined after voting against the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. He also controversially accepted an invitation to visit Francoist Spain, returning with favourable reports on the r\u00e9gime. He narrowly avoided de-selection prior to the 1950 general election. When the election was held he was unseated, with the Conservatives regaining the seat.\nIn 1971 he resigned from the Labour Party over its support for trade unions whose only purpose he claimed was the \"continual forcing up of wage rates, regardless of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and equally regardless of the public interest.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
