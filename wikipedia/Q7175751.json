For example, Scottish Green Peter McColl argues that elected governments should abolish poverty through a citizens income scheme, regulate against social and environmental malpractice and encourage environmental good practice through state procurement. At the same time, economic and political power should be devolved as far as is possible through co-operatives and increased local decision making. By putting political and economic power into the hands of the people most likely to be affected by environmental injustice, it is less likely that the injustice will take place.\"Another World Isn't Possible: A case for Eco-Socialism\"."]}, {"page": "Bright Green", "response": ["Regular contributors include former MSP Mark Ballard, Maggie Chapman, Peter McColl, Adam Ramsay, Gary Dunion and Sarah Beattie-Smith."]}, {"page": "Steve Morrison (TV producer)", "response": ["In 2015, Morrison was elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh, beating incumbent Peter McColl with 61.9% of votes."]}, {"page": "Young Academy of Scotland", "response": ["The members (equal numbers of women and men in their 20s to 40s) aim to provide ideas and direction for challenges facing Scotland.
