He took the name \"Severin\" from the Leopold von Sacher-Masoch character who is mentioned in the Velvet Underground song \"Venus in Furs\". Severin had earlier considered \"Steve Spunker\" for his stage name. After the split of Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1996, Severin created his own label RE: and released several instrumental albums via his official website.

They have been widely influential, both over their contemporaries and with later acts. Q magazine included John McKay's guitar playing on \"Hong Kong Garden\"  in their list of \"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever\", while Mojo rated guitarist John McGeoch in their list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" for his work on \"Spellbound\". The Times cited the group as \"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\".", "Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin met at a Roxy Music concert in September 1975, at a time when glam rock had faded and there was nothing new coming through with which they could identify. From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the \"Bromley Contingent\", as most of them came from the Bromley area in south east London, a label Severin came to despise. \"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \"The Lord's Prayer\"."]}, {"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["The Saint Martins gig was followed by other performances at colleges and art schools around London.

According to Reynolds, with their fourth album, 1981's Juju, the Banshees included several gothic qualities, lyrically and sonically, whereas according to The Guardian, Juju was art rock on certain album tracks and pop on the singles. Their bassist, Steven Severin, attributed the aesthetic used by the Banshees around that time to the influence of the Cramps. The Cure's \"oppressively dispirited\" trio of albums, Seventeen Seconds (1980), Faith (1981) and Pornography (1982), cemented that group's stature in the genre. The line \"It doesn't matter if we all die\" began the Pornography album, which is considered as \"the Cure's gothic piece de resistance\". They would later become the most commercially successful of these groups. The Cure's style was \"withdrawn\", contrasting with their contemporaries like Nick Cave's first band, the Birthday Party, who drew on blues and spastic, violent turmoil. With the Birthday Party's Junkyard album, Nick Cave combined \"sacred and profane\" things, using Old Testament imagery with stories about sin, curses and damnation. Their 1981 single \"Release the Bats\" was particularly influential in the scene."]}, {"page": "Robert Smith (musician)", "response": ["Robert Smith met Steven Severin of Siouxsie and the Banshees at a Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire gig at the London YMCA on 3 August 1979.Thompson, Dave & Jo-Ann Greene.

Early versions of \"Play for Today\" and \"M\" had been performed at a few concerts, but Dempsey did not like the new musical direction that Smith wanted to take. Smith commented: \"I think the final straw came when I played Michael the demos for the next album and he hated them. He wanted us to be XTC part 2 and \u2013 if anything \u2013 I wanted us to be the Banshees part 2. So he left\".

The records to which Smith was frequently listening during the composition of the album were Five Leaves Left by Nick Drake, Isle of Wight by Jimi Hendrix, Astral Weeks by Van Morrison and Low by David Bowie. Smith wrote the lyrics and music for most of the record at his parents' home, on a Hammond organ with a built-in tape recorder.
