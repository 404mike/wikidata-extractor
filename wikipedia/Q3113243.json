He made his debut in the Five Nations in 1987. He was selected for the Rugby World Cup finals in 1987, playing a single match, and again in 1995 when he played against Manu Samoa. That was his last England cap, earned at the age of 36, his international career being limited by the presence in the England team of Brian Moore.\nHe won 14 major trophies during 12 years at Bath before moving on to Sale and also represented the Barbarians, South West, Cornwall and Devon.\nDawe became player-coach of Plymouth Albion in 1999, making his debut for his hometown team on his 40th birthday. He is believed to be the first 50-year-old to play professional rugby, turning out for Plymouth Albion in the Championship and British & Irish Cup.\nHe guided Plymouth from the bottom of National League Three South to National League 1 (now known as the Championship). Albion nearly went all the way to the Premiership but narrowly missed out in 2004-05, the same season they reached their first Twickenham final.\nOn 21 November 2011 Graham was relieved of his duties as Chairman of Rugby at Plymouth Albion due to lack of finance. After leaving Albion, Dawe worked as a coaching consultant and helped out Premiership club Saracens. He was persuaded to return to Plymouth in 2015 when they were sitting bottom of the Championship and having given notice of administration. Dawe totally rebuilt the squad and they won 22 of their 30 games in National One before he left the club following a change of ownership.\nHe helped Devon reach six County Championship finals between 2000 and 2008. He finished coaching Devon in 2010 and in 2014 took over as head coach of Cornwall, helping them to three consecutive finals, winning it in 2015 and 2016, the first time Cornwall had won consecutive titles in their history.\nIn early 2015 Dawe was also asked to do some work with the England squad by new coach Eddie Jones. He has also coached the Barbarians, Royal Navy and University of St Mark and St John.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bath Rugby", "response": ["| Gareth Chilcott, Graham Dawe, David Egerton, Jon Hall, Nigel Redman, Richard Hill", "| Ben Clarke, Graham Dawe, Jeremy Guscott, John Mallett, Jonathan Callard, Phil de Glanville, Mike Catt, Steve Ojomoh, Victor Ubogu"]}, {"page": "Tavistock", "response": ["*Graham Dawe (England, Sale and Bath rugby hooker) and Rob Baxter (the Exeter Chiefs and England rugby coach) were both born in Tavistock."]}, {"page": "Sport in Cornwall", "response": ["Cornish rugby has produced many fine rugby players who have played at international level.

As a punishment the RFU gave the club a 20-point deduction going into the new season.  This gave the club too much to do, and despite a brave attempt they were relegated from National League 1 at the end of the 2010-11 season.  The club would spend a number of seasons in National League 2 South until the 2015-16 season.  Despite having a promising team that made up the bulk of the Cornwall side that won the 2015 Bill Beaumont Cup, the relegation of nearby Plymouth Albion from the RFU Championship the previous season, would lead to almost the entire Launceston first team leaving to join the Devon club, where incidentally, Graham Dawe (the Cornwall head coach), was director of rugby.  This, coupled with Launceston being on their third head coach in a little over a year, contributed to the worst season in the club's league history as they were relegated without winning a game.  Despite improved performances the following season in National League 3 South West (including a win against rivals, Camborne) the club suffered their second successive relegation, dropping to Tribute South West 1 West.", "* Graham Dawe \u2013 earned 5 caps with England and won 14 major trophies with Bath.
