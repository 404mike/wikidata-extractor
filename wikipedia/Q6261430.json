The Black Shorts are portrayed as a tiny group of around a dozen men and teenage boys dressed in uniforms like those of the Sturmabteilung. They also have the same flag colour scheme as the National Socialists. Their flag is similar in design to the flag of the British Union of Fascists (which used the party's symbol, the Flash and Circle). Members of the Black Shorts comprise the small, enthusiastic audience to whom Spode makes loud, dramatic Hitler-like speeches in which he announces bizarre statements of policy, such as giving each citizen at birth a British-made bicycle and umbrella. He also makes several statements revolving around root vegetables. In the original stories, none of Spode's speeches are depicted and no other members of his group make an appearance. In the television series only, Spode has a secret recorded in the Junior Ganymede club book involving a kangaroo named Celia.", "* In the 1975 musical Jeeves, Spode was portrayed by John Turner, who also played Spode in the television series Jeeves and Wooster.
