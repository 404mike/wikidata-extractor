Esther's siblings included John Puget, of Pointer's Grove, near Totteridge, Hertfordshire, Director of the Bank of England, and Rear-Admiral Peter Puget, CB, who explored with Captain George Vancouver and after whom Puget Sound is named.\nThe family lived at Bickley Hall, built for his uncle John Wells by Robert Mylne in 1780, and extended to a design by Sir Robert Smirke in 1810.He also owned the Malling Heath estate in Kent.\nHe was among the leading shipbuilders on the River Thames, a partner in yards at Deptford, Rotherhithe and Blackwall.\nHe served as High Sheriff of Kent for 1812, and then stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Maidstone in 1818.He was elected as the Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone at the general election in March 1820, and held the seat until 1830; he did not stand again for Maidstone.Wells was a strong opponent of the Catholic Emancipation Bill in 1828, declaring that he would fight to defend the Protestant Constitution \"until he was up to his knees in blood\".\nHe increasingly moved towards the Whigs and was said to be very much his own man.\nWells died two weeks after his wife when he was aged 87.

The area remained rural, save for a small hunting lodge belonging to the Wells family dating to 1759. The Lodge was gradually enlarged to become Bickley Hall, a classical house designed by Robert Mylne, FRS, for John Wells, shipbuilder, in 1780 (demolished 1963). His brother William, shipbuilder and a director of Greenwich Hospital, inherited the estate, and his son John commissioned additions by Robert Smirke in 1810. John Wells began selling part of his lands in 1841 following due to financial difficulties, and by the late 1850s a few large houses had been built in the area, aided by the opening of Bickley railway station (formerly named Southborough Road) in 1858 and Chislehurst station in 1865. Much of the area was purchased and developed by George Wythes, who commissioned numerous large houses for the wealthy classes, most of them designed by Richard Norman Shaw and Ernest Newton and, in the early part of the following century, C. H. B. Quennell St George's Church was built in 1865, and a cricket ground in 1868. Smaller-scale development continued throughout the early 20th century, and several of the older, larger properties demolished or sub-divided. The area today remains a wealthy one, characterised by large detached housing.", "*John Wells (1761\u20131846), of Bickley Hall, High Sheriff of Kent.
