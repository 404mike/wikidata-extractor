Air Commodore Raymond Collishaw, commanding 204 Group RAF (renamed the Desert Air Force), wrote to Air Marshal Arthur Tedder on 24 April. The arrival of JG\u00a027 and ZG\u00a026 near Tobruk allowed the German formations to arrive at great height within ten minutes of an air raid warning, leaving British fighters at lower altitude and a great disadvantage. He remarked attrition had caused  \"a serious reduction in our fighter force.\" Air Marshal Arthur Longmore cabled the Air Ministry in London. He told London that to maintain patrols, the fighters were forced to refuel at Sidi Barrani granting Axis air units a free hand over Tobruk but arguing that without patrols to defend fighter squadrons refuelling at Tobruk on the ground, they were \"hostage to a fortune we cannot afford.\" On 1 May, for example, No. 274 Squadron RAF lost all six Hurricanes it sent on a single mission when a flight of Bf\u00a0109s from JG\u00a027 led by Gerhard Homuth, and containing the most successful fighter pilot in Africa, Hans-Joachim Marseille, engaged them from a superior altitude over Tobruk. JG\u00a027 opposed the aerial element of Operation Brevity. The operation was called off within 48 hours after strong German resistance. JG\u00a027 accounted for four British aircraft, one of them was piloted by Noel Agazarian who was killed. The Tobruk defenders were hard-pressed against Luftwaffe fighter operations and on 21 May; 73, 213 and 274 Squadrons were their main units. Joachim M\u00fcncheberg arrived with 7./JG\u00a026 on 1 June to assist JG\u00a027. In the build-up to Operation Battleaxe, RAF bombers attacked airfields at Gazala. I./JG\u00a027 were forced to decamp personnel to the beach, and pitch camps between the dunes. 2 staffel Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt may have sunk a 200-ton sailing ship, the eight crew washed up in German territory and were captured. In early June, pilots were pressing for the arrival of the Bf\u00a0109\u00a0F. The Bf\u00a0109\u00a0E, which the Hurricane could match under some circumstances, was grossly inferior to the newer Bf\u00a0109. On the eve of Battleaxe, the Luftwaffe could muster 7./JG\u00a026, I./JG\u00a027, several staffeln from LG\u00a01, two gruppen of Ju\u00a087s from StG\u00a01 StG 3. At the beginning of the battle another well-known and long-serving pilot began to achieve success; Ludwig Franzisket, future Geschwaderkommodore. Twenty-four British aircraft were shot down and three badly damaged in the brief fighting. JG\u00a027 lost two pilots killed. The 17 June was particularly successful; eight Hurricanes were shot down. Over the next weeks, a stalemate developed with the Luftwaffe attempting to bomb Tobruk into surrender by destroying seaborne supplies. JG\u00a027 fought virtually daily battles with the RAF, RAAF and South African Air Force Commonwealth forces for control of the skies until September 1941."]}, {"page": "List of SOE agents", "response": ["| Jack Agazarian||  France  || British || 1916\u20131945||||KIA, 1945.
