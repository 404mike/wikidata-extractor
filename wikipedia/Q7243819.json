After his narrow points loss to Arron, Booth secured himself a 17 May shot for the vacant English light-middleweight title against Navid Mansouri (11-1-1) at Ponds Forge Arena in Sheffield. Originally, Mansouri was scheduled to face Nathan Graham (14-5-1), however, that encounter was postponed due to an injury suffered by Graham, to which Booth stepped in at late notice as a replacement. Mansouri charged, but Booth was unfazed, using his jab and moving nicely. Booth did open up but Mansouri was very impressive in evading the shots. Just before the end of the first, Booth had success with a right hand which made Mansouri wince, with him returning to his corner in discomfort and concerned about his left eye. Booth obviously felt in control in the second-round; Booth did less than Mansouri but his work was more effective; Mansouri charged at Booth with mixed results. Mansouri rushed at Booth early in the third but found himself tied up. Much of the work was done at close quarters in this session and it was difficult to judge who had the upper hand. In the fourth, Booth offered some crisp work but spent time admiring his successes whilst the less-refined Mansouri chugged along. In the fifth, Mansouri landed some scoring punches early in the session, especially to the body, and Booth was much less comfortable having to put pressure on rather than react to it. Round six was another close round with both fighters beginning to look tired. Booth opened up with determination to start the seventh, and Mansouri boxed off the back foot again. Mansouri was still scoring sporadically to the body, though Booth was hunting him down but not taking full advantage of the positions he was getting himself into, throwing ones and twos rather than sustained combinations. Booth cracked in a hard right early in the eighth but rather than pouncing on Mansouri he took his time which might not have been the best strategy given that Mansouri did look a little tired. Mansouri's courage had shown as Booth asked him a question in the ninth, with the Rotherham man coming back with a nice right hand; Booth was invariably on the front foot but he just couldn't nail Mansouri down. Booth landed a nice left hook to begin the final round. Booth charged but Mansouri stopped him with a counter right hook. A left hook to the body landed from Booth but Mansouri characteristically gritted his teeth and fired back. Referee Terry O\u2019Connor had to split the tiring pair several times as their admirable efforts became more scrappy. Booth landed a hard overhand right but the final bell came before he could seek any advantage from it. After ten entertaining rounds of boxing, judges Steve Gray, Mark Lyson, and Dave Parris scored the bout 94\u201398, 94\u201398, and 94\u201396 all in favour for Mansouri, who improved his spotless record to 12-1-1.", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Prince Arron"]}]}}
