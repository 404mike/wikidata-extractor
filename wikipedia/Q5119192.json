He then spent two years with Leyton Orient before joining Lincoln City for the 2004\u201305 season. He was loaned out to Cambridge United later that season but ended up suffering relegation to the Conference National with Cambridge while his parent club lost out on promotion in the League Two Play-off final. Following a trial he signed for Grimsby Town the following season and remained with The Mariners for three seasons and suffered a play-off final defeat in his first year whilst finishing joint top scorer in his second season.
