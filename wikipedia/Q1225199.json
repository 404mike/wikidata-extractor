Hargreaves and Inglis trip gear was first applied to a large single cylinder 1800\u00a0hp Corliss engine at Eagley Mills near Bolton and the company received a Gold Medal for its products at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition. Mill gearing was a speciality including large flywheels for rope drives, one example of 128 tons being 32\u00a0ft in diameter and groved for 56 ropes. Turbines and hydraulic machinery were also manufactured. Many of the tools were to suit the specialist work, with travelling cranes to take 15 to 40 tons in weight, a large lathe, side planer, slotting machine, pit planer and a tool for turning four 32\u00a0ft rope flywheels simultaneously. The workshops also featured an 80ton hydraulic riveting machine.

After trials with an old single-driver converted into a 2-cylinder compound in 1878, he introduced in 1882 his first Experiment class with similar divided-drive: 3-cylinder compounds with uncoupled driving wheels in which two small outside high-pressure cylinders exhausted into one large low-pressure one between the frames. Other similar classes followed, progressively enlarged. The uncoupled driving wheels were problematic as the two pairs of wheels could be rotating in opposite directions on starting, if a locomotive had previously backed onto its train. The arrangement appears to have been adopted due to lack of space, but Tuplin has pointed out that if Walschaert's valve gear had been fitted, the driving wheels could have been coupled in the normal way."]}]}}
