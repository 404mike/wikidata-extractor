In 1854 he established what would later be called the Met Office, and created systems to get weather information to sailors and fishermen for their safety. He was an able surveyor and hydrographer.

Lyell's interpretation of geological change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a powerful influence on the young Charles Darwin. Lyell asked Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, to search for erratic boulders on the survey voyage of the Beagle, and just before it set out FitzRoy gave Darwin Volume 1 of the first edition of Lyell's Principles.

De Berlanga eventually returned to the Spanish Empire and described the conditions of the islands and the animals that inhabited them. The group of islands was shown and named \"Insulae de los Galopegos\" (Islands of the Tortoises) in Abraham Ortelius's atlas published in 1570.

These names were used in the authoritative navigation charts of the islands prepared during the Beagle survey under captain Robert FitzRoy, and in Darwin's popular book The Voyage of the Beagle. The newly independent Republic of Ecuador took the islands from Spanish ownership in 1832, and subsequently gave them official Spanish names.Discovery, Darwin and Evolution The older names remained in use in English-language publications, including Herman Melville's The Encantadas of 1854.", "The voyage of the Beagle brought the survey ship HMS Beagle, under captain Robert FitzRoy, to the Gal\u00e1pagos on 15 September 1835 to survey approaches to harbours.
