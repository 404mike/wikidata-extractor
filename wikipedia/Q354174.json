Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and Dennis Stratton was hired instead. Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979. Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"Sanctuary\" and \"Wrathchild\". The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal (NWoBHM) movement. According to different sources between May 1976 and December 1979 the band played about 200 shows in Great Britain.", "The band played over 100 dates in North America supporting Scorpions, Judas Priest and Rainbow. Iron Maiden headlined some Canadian dates, New York, Chicago free show and the other soloed stops. They also performed at the biggest American festivals (Day on the Green, SuperFest, Pacific Jam, Rock Fest) which were held on big stadiums as Rich Stadium, Anaheim Stadium, Oakland Alameda Coliseum or Comiskey Park among many others. Iron Maiden were quickly promoted to the hard rock extra-league and avantgarde of heavy metal. The Number of the Beast is considered as the ground-breaking album for modern heavy metal and has been back on the album sales charts and the all time heavy metal albums polls constantly. The album's crowning track entitled \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is considered one of a few most important in the history of the genre, it has repeatedly held leading positions in various polls. After the first year of its release 2.5 million copies were sold. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; by 2010, the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide. The \"Golden Era\" in the band's history has begun Since a few decades The Number of the Beast is considered one of the albums of all time (Top 3, Top 5) in heavy music, and by December 2021 it had sold almost 20 million copies worldwide. In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain, who previously played for Trust. Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities, Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.", "The reunion world tour that followed consisted of well over 100\u00a0dates (including 31 shows of 1999 tour) and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of over 250,000. While the performance was being produced for a CD and a highly successful DVD release in March 2002, under the name Rock in Rio, the band took a year off from touring, during which they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy in aid of former drummer Clive Burr, who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The band performed two further concerts for Burr's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005, and 2007, before his death in 2013.", "Following this run of European shows, the band co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath. An average festival's concerts attendance was estimated as 30,000 people. The San Bernardino show before 50,000 fans earned international press coverage after it was sabotaged by singer Ozzy Osbourne's family, who took offence to Dickinson's remarks against reality TV. The band completed the tour by headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26\u201328 August, and the RDS Stadium in Ireland on 31 August. For the second time, the band played a charity show for The Clive Burr MS Trust Fund, which took place at the Hammersmith Apollo. The same year, the band were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk in Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles. In so same period Iron Maiden were inducted into Kerrang! Hall of Fame.", "The band went on to play a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park, to approximately 80,000 people in attendance. Iron Maiden performed at Olympic Stadium (Rome) in Rome, Bazaly Stadium in Ostrava, Lokomotiv Stadium in Sofia, Sudweststadion in Ludwigshafen, Fair Arena in Belgrade, Bezigrad Stadion in Ljubjana, played shows in the big indoor arenas of D\u00fcsseldorf and Athens.

King assembled  a star-studded lineup featuring Di'Anno, drummer Clive Burr, guitarists Janick Gers and Pete Willis and bassist Neil Murray, but the members became increasingly frustrated by a policy that forbade them from writing any original material. Gogmagog released a three-song E.P. on the independent Food For Thought label in 1985 entitled I Will Be There, with Russ Ballard writing the title song and producer King writing the other two songs.
