Although there are extensive liner notes from Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson for each track in the booklet of the CD, sometimes it isn't easy to classify the tracks chronologically. \"Walking\" is - considering the chronology - the first recorded track on this compilation. It was recorded by Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson in 1972, so it might be a recording of the band Blue Condition. The tracks, which are following chronologically, are those from the Tapestry Sessions in early 1976, shortly after the band changed its name from S.O.B. to Son Of A Bitch. These songs are \"Still Fit to Rock 'n' Roll\", the early title of \"Still Fit to Boogie\", \"Ain't You Glad to Be Alive\" and the first version of \"Freeway Mad\" (printed as \"Freeway Mad (Part 1)\" in the booklet and misprinted as \"Freeway Mad (Part 2)\" on the inlay). Then there are the tracks from the Luxemburg sessions in 1978, still recorded under the moniker of Son Of A Bitch. These tracks are \"See the Light Shining\", \"Stand up and Be Counted\", the second version of \"Freeway Mad\" (printed as \"Freeway Mad (Part 2)\" in the booklet and on the inlay), \"Ann Marie\", \"Lift up Your Eyes\" and \"Street Fighting Gang\" (misprinted as \"Street Fighting Man\" in the booklet and on the inlay).

The studio version of \"Frozen Rainbow\" with Rod Argent on keyboards and the original version of \"Big teaser\" cannot be classified chronologically, but they seem to be recorded, when Saxon still was called Son Of A Bitch.

An attempt to perform under the name \"SAXON\" alone was prevented by Peter \"Biff\" Byford, another member of the original band, threatening legal action. In 1997, Oliver and Dawson registered \"SAXON\" as a trademark, and attempted, through their management company, to prevent Byford's band using the name on their promotional material. Byford opposed this registration, but initially the UK Patent Office held that the registration was valid, as Oliver and Dawson (as original members of \"Son of a Bitch\" in 1978) had equal rights to Byford in the name \"SAXON\". However, the High Court overturned the registration, ruling that it had been applied for in bad faith.  Oliver and Dawson were thereby prevented from describing themselves as \"Saxon\" and obliged to prominently include the \"Oliver/Dawson\" element of the name in their advertising material. The name \"Saxon\" had been given to the band by then Freddy Cannon, Managing Director of Carrere Records UK, because retail outlets refused to carry \"Son of A Bitch\" in 1978.
