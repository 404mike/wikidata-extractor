He never established himself as a first-team player with the club, but was a mainstay of the reserve team and performed solidly when given a game in the First Division. He joined Grimsby Town in early 1927, spending only a few months with the club and making just six appearances before returning to the Midlands to sign for Coventry City. The following year he moved to Walsall, and in late 1929 moved on again, this time to Torquay United, before retiring at the end of the 1929\u201330 season.He was nicknamed \"Sailor\", because of his service in the Royal Navy in the First World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jock Morgan", "response": ["Morgan was born in Penicuik, Midlothian. He began his football career with Edinburgh Emmett and then came to England to sign for Birmingham of the First Division in August 1924. He played only once for Birmingham, deputising for the injured Jimmy Cringan and his regular understudy Bill Hunter at centre half in a 4\u20130 defeat at Sunderland on 6 September 1924.Matthews, p. 167. After a brief spell in non-league football with Redditch Town he settled at Doncaster Rovers, where he played 150 Third Division North games in four seasons. After one Second Division game in one-and-a-half seasons for Bristol City, a return to the Third with Barrow offered more playing time. Short spells with Walsall and Southport and a venture to Ireland with Brideville preceded a return to non-league football in the English Midlands with Worcester City and Atherstone Town."]}, {"page": "Bill Hunter", "response": ["Bill Hunter or Billy Hunter may refer to:", "* Bill Hunter (catcher) (1855\u2013?), baseball catcher", "* Bill Hunter (outfielder) (1887\u20131934), American baseball player", "* Bill Hunter (footballer, born 1900), Scottish football defender", "* Bill Hunter (ice hockey) (1920\u20132002), Canadian hockey owner, general manager, coach", "* Bill Hunter (New Zealand footballer), New Zealand international football (soccer) player", "* Bill Hunter (politician) (1920\u20132015), Trotskyist leader in Britain and an International Socialist League member", "* Bill Hunter (actor) (1940\u20132011), Australian actor", "* Bill Hunter (journalist) (died 1964), American crime reporter"]}]}}
