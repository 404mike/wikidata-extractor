In March 1924, Robert Byron and Harold Acton were forbidden by the university authorities to enact an 1840 Exhibition event. The Victorian fancy dress party was hosted at the club as a protest. The club was finally closed down in May 1925 by the dean of Balliol College, Oxford, \"Sligger\" Urquhart after a party where members dressed as nuns and choirboys and painted their lips vermillion. It's interesting to notice that another source states that Robert Byron and The Widow Lloyd gave a Victorian party where men dressed in feminine apparel and Arden Hilliard masqueraded as a nun. That night Hilliard went through the gate of Balliol in his nun costume. Hilliard was promptly dismissed by Balliol. Translation: For example, another of my friends, Arden Hilliard, made a provocatorial act crossing the imposing portal of Balliol disguised as a nun to go to the costume ball of the club of Hypocrites. He was promptly dismissed.", "File:William Cecil James Philip John Paul Howard Clonmore, 8th Earl of Wicklow.jpg|William Howard, 8th Earl of Wicklow"]}]}}
