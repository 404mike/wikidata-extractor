He began his professional academic career at Oxford University, before taking the Douglas Chair in Civil Law at the School of Law of his alma mater, the University of Glasgow. He later served as Distinguished Research Professor and held the Ernest P. Rogers Chair at the University of Georgia School of Law. He was also Visiting Professor at the Edinburgh University School of Law, where he held the Chair in Civil Law from 1968 until 1981.\nWatson regularly served as a distinguished lecturer at leading universities in the United States and such countries as Italy, Holland, Germany, France, Poland, South Africa, Israel and Serbia. He attended several sessions regarding the development of a common law for the EU, including one in Maastricht in 2000, and, at the request of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), served as a member of the two-person U.S. team helping to revise the draft civil code for the new Republic of Armenia.\nHe was an honorary member of the Speculative Society and served as North American secretary of the Stair Society. He was an editorial board member of a number of learned journals.\nIn 2005, the University of Belgrade's Law School established the Alan Watson Foundation in honour of his worldwide scholarship.\nWatson was honoured by his international colleagues in 2000\u201301 when two collections of essays were presented in his honour: an American volume, Lex et Romanitas: Essays for Alan Watson, and the European volume, Critical Studies in Ancient Law, Comparative Law and Legal History.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Comparative law", "response": ["For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the United Nations System, in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations.

Thus, according to R\u00fcpke, \"by the sacer-esto-formula, a curse declaring someone outlawed[,].... the delinquent\" may be killed by anyone. Specifically, according to R\u00fcpke, \"if somebody has sold his wife, he shall be sacrificed to the lower gods\"., citing \"Plut. Rom. 22.4\". The enactment of \"the law that whoever sold his wife should be given over to the infernal gods\"To similar effect and attributing enactment to Romulus:  was, according to John Andrew Couch in 1894, credited to Romulus. According to Alan Watson in 1972, \"anyone who sold his wife was to be dedicated [apparently 'sacrificed'] to the gods of the underworld.\" (dedicated in sense of 'sacrificed' per pp.\u00a0100, 102, 103), citing, at n.\u00a025, Plutarch, Romulus. \"The husband who sold his wife was to be sacrificed (if we may so translate Plutarch\u00a0...) to the infernal deities\", according to Fowler in 1911.Fowler, W.

According to R\u00fcpke, this judgment and punishment reflected and was legitimized by religion. However, after a while, the offense was no longer punished; according to Mary Emily Case, \"this very primitive kind of justice [in which \"one who violated these rules [\"of the fas,\u2014that is, of religious duty\"] was pronounced accursed, and might be killed by any who met him\"] soon fell into disuse, and offences which were merely nefas\u2014such, for example, as selling a wife\u2014ceased to be punished.

Of Gaius' two forms, which was the original form would also give an indication of the historical development. If the a re in personam form came first, then it must surely have come after the creation of bonae fidei contract forms, since the transfer of a stipulatio of mutuum form into a literal contract would have otherwise given no real benefit. It might have done if the literal contract was used to consolidate several different debts between two parties, to simplify them into a single action, but none of the texts point to this: they refer to a singular preceding obligation. If the a personam in personam form came first, then the development could have come much earlier. The consent of the debtor was probably required: this is stated as fact by some modern lawyers, although Watson points to the alternative explanation of Stoj\u010devi\u0107.
