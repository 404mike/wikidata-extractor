He then spent time on loan with Northwich Victoria and Halifax Town during 2007\u201308, before having further loan spells at Grimsby Town, Kettering Town and Luton Town respectively. He was released by Barnsley in May 2010, and signed for League Two club Oxford United shortly after. Heslop made over 100 appearances for Oxford during his three-year stay there.

As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record, which led to him being named on the bench for two first-team matches in the League Cup, they decided to keep him on for a third year. As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club's reserve and youth team. This led to him to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football. He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th-minute substitute in a 3\u20131 defeat to Stevenage Borough. He converted a Simon Heslop cross during a match against Dagenham & Redbridge to score his first career goal, which helped Kidderminster to a 3\u20131 victory. Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on Soccer AM's showboating section."]}, {"page": "Huntington School, York", "response": ["* Footballer Simon Heslop"]}, {"page": "Heslop", "response": ["*Simon Heslop (born 1987), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from York", "response": ["*Simon Heslop (born 1987)"]}, {"page": "Sean Newton", "response": ["On 28 October 2016, Newton was reunited with Mills after joining Wrexham's National League rivals York City on loan until 4 January 2017, with a view to a permanent transfer on a one-and-a-half-year contract.
