In the early 20th century, the British nobleman and politician Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, acquired a few P\u00e8re David's deer from the Berlin Zoo and built up a large herd on his estate at Woburn Abbey. In the 1980s, the duke's great-grandson Robin Russell, 14th Duke of Bedford, donated several dozen deer to the Chinese government for reintroducing the species to the wild. As of 2020, the wild population in China was estimated 2825 individuals, with a further 7380 in various nature reserves in China.Cheng, Z. B., Tian, X. H., Zhong, Z. Y., Li, P. F., Sun, D.
