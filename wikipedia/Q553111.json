While McCenzie returns to the camp to save the life of Cecilia, the woman who originally recruited him, the tourists opt to snipe at the attacking troops, which draws attention to them and results in the apparent death of Vanderbeer (Charlie Bewley). As tourists and tour guide reunite and they flee the ambush, St John directs them to a helipad attached to a mine complex, and his obvious knowledge of the terrain forces him to reveal that he is in fact a mineral trader and a native of the island, and has only returned in order to arrange supply of the rare and valuable metal coltan.

In prison they are reunited with Vanderbeer, and though he initially plays innocent they rapidly realise that he is the traitor who informed Mason of the rebels' location; he reveals that he negotiated a deal with the dictator to sell the rebels out in exchange for money to replace his lost fortune, having lost all of his wealth in a stock market crash."]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2011", "response": ["| Like Crazy || Paramount Vantage || Drake Doremus (director); Drake Doremus, Ben York Jones (screenplay); Anton Yelchin, Felicity Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Charlie Bewley || Romance, Drama ||"]}, {"page": "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2", "response": ["*Charlie Bewley as Demetri"]}, {"page": "Nashville (2012 TV series)", "response": ["In addition to the main cast, several actors appeared in Nashville in supporting roles.
