Eclipse was not originally part of the game; early concepts had the apprentice as an older character who develops a connection with a young Princess Leia. Star Wars creator George Lucas, uncomfortable with this idea, encouraged the developers to create a love interest. The apprentice, who has had limited interaction with women when the game begins, does not at first know how to act around her. Her introduction early in the game allows the relationship with Starkiller to develop, and her inclusion helps \"recapture that rich ensemble feel of the original Star Wars\". According to Sean Williams, who wrote the novelization, the romantic storyline is the key to The Force Unleashed. The name \"Juno Eclipse\" was originally proposed as a name for the character eventually called \"Asajj Ventress\"\u00a0\u2014 it was ultimately rejected as insufficiently villainous. The Force Unleashed project lead Haden Blackman brought the name back for the mythic quality of the name \"Juno\" and the duality suggested by an \"eclipse.\" Cox, in addition to strongly resembling the character's concept art, had \"integrity and poise\" appropriate to Juno Eclipse that helped the actor secure the role."]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2005", "response": ["| Kingdom of Heaven || 20th Century Fox / Scott Free Productions || Ridley Scott (director); William Monahan (screenplay); Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Marton Csokas, Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, Michael Sheen, Kevin McKidd, Ulrich Thomsen, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Iain Glen, Alexander Siddig, Eriq Ebouaney, Bronson Webb, Velibor Topi\u0107, Ghassan Massoud, Khaled Nabawy, Jon Finch, Martin Hancock, Nathalie Cox, Jouko Ahola, Giannina Facio, Philip Glenister, Steven Robertson, Angus Wright || Drama ||"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2008", "response": ["| Jumper || 20th Century Fox / Regency Enterprises || Doug Liman (director); David S.

In Mulholland's scenes as Jabba, Jabba is represented as a rotund human dressed in a shaggy fur coat. George Lucas has stated his intention was to use an alien creature for Jabba, but the special effects technology of the time was not up to the task of replacing Mulholland. In 1997, the \"Special Edition\" re-releases restored and altered the original scene to include a computer generated portrayal of Jabba. In Return of the Jedi, he was played by puppeteers Mike Edmonds, Toby Philpott, David Alan Barclay and voiced by Larry Ward. Jabba was voiced by Scott Schumann in post-1997 editions of Star Wars and in The Phantom Menace. In The Phantom Menace end credits, Jabba was jokingly credited as playing himself. His puppeteers have appeared in the documentaries From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga and Classic Creatures: Return of the Jedi. David Alan Barclay, who was one of the puppeteers for Jabba in the film, voiced Jabba in the Super NES video game adaptation of Return of the Jedi. In the radio drama adaption of the original trilogy, Jabba is played by Ed Asner. In the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the following television series, Jabba is portrayed by Kevin Michael Richardson. All other video game appearances of Jabba were played by Clint Bajakian. Jabba was supposed to appear in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, but was left out due to time constraints. A cutscene was produced featuring a conversation between Jabba and Juno Eclipse (voiced by Nathalie Cox), which was scrapped from the game.
