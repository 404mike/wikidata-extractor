By the early 1990s, he had moved towards a more dark European house music style, though by the time of his Shelley's residency he had begun to experiment more with American house. His tastes further developed as he moved to Renaissance, and he began to incorporate the pop-based sounds of Moby, Spooky, and Leftfield. Sasha's second Digweed collaboration, 1997's Northern Exposure, was described as \"epic house\", and subsequent releases featured the spacey and atmospheric trance house sound of artists such as Sven V\u00e4th, Matt Darey, Tilt, and Armin Van Buuren. A rhythmic and bassy progressive house influence distinguished his Xpander EP and the mix albums of the late 1990s. At the time, Sasha's music rotation included records by artists such as Space Manoeuvres, BT, and Breeder, and Sander Kleinenberg's single \"My Lexicon\"."]}, {"page": "Creamfields (2004 album)", "response": ["#\"Point Zero\" by Li Kwan, presented by Matt Darey"]}, {"page": "Simon Berry", "response": ["On 15 June 2002, his track \"Madagascar\" reached number one on the UK Dance Singles Chart.

The track \"Gouryella\" was released in May 1999 and became a huge hit scoring various chart positions around the world, including a top fifteen position in the UK Singles Chart.

Released through the Tsunami imprint, both singles went on to be certified Gold on record sales.
