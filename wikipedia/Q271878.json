During his time as viceroy, Lord Curzon created the territory of Eastern Bengal and Assam, and fought with the British military commander Lord Kitchener. During the First World War, he served in the small War Cabinet of Prime Minister David Lloyd George as Leader of the House of Lords (from December 1916), as well as the War Policy Committee. He served as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the Foreign Office from 1919 to 1924.\nDespite his successes as both viceroy and foreign secretary, in 1923 Curzon was denied the office of prime minister. Bonar Law and other Conservative Party leaders preferred to have Stanley Baldwin rather than Curzon as prime minister and these views were made known to King George V. David Gilmour, in his biography Curzon: Imperial Statesman (1994), contends that Curzon deserved the top position.", "link_mentions": {}}}
