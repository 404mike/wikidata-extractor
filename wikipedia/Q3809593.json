Sloane served as the managing editor for the first issue of Amazing Stories (April 1926) and as the associate editor from the second issue (May 1926) on.

British science fiction writers and fans such as John Russell Fearn, Walter Gillings, and P. E.

Gillings began collecting submissions for the magazine in 1943, but the publisher, Temple Bar, delayed launching it until the success of New Worlds, another British science fiction magazine, convinced them there was a viable market.  Gillings obtained stories from Eric Frank Russell, John Russell Fearn, and Arthur C. Clarke, whose \"Technical Error\" was the first story of Clarke's to see print in the UK.  Gillings published two more stories by Clarke, both under pseudonyms, but Temple Bar ceased publication of Fantasy after the third issue because of paper shortages caused by World War II.  Gillings was able to use some of the stories he had acquired for Fantasy in 1950, when he became editor of Science Fantasy.", "Temple Bar finally took the plunge in 1946, convinced by the success of New Worlds, another British sf magazine, which had been launched that summer.  The first issue, in digest format, was dated December 1946.  The title was Fantasy, though there was no connection to Newnes' pre-war pulp magazine of that name; it was subtitled \"The Magazine of Science Fiction\".   The lead story was \"Last Conflict\", by John Russell Fearn, and the issue also included a reprint of \"The Worlds of If\", a story by Stanley Weinbaum, and Clarke's \"Technical Error\"\u2014his first sale to a British market.Harbottle & Holland (1992), p. 23.Tuck (1982), p. 561.  \"Technical Error\" proved to be the most popular story in the issue.  Two more of Clarke's stories appeared in the next two issues, both under pseudonyms: \"Castaway\", as by \"Charles Willis\", and \"The Fires Within\", as by \"E.G. O'Brien\".Ashley (2000), p. 203.  Eric Frank Russell appeared in the second issue, with the lead story, \"Relic\", about a robot returning to Earth; Ashley describes it as memorable, and comments that several other contributors to the magazine, including Leslie V. Heald, P.E. Cleator, E.R. James, and Norman C. Pallant, wrote \"competent stories for the time\".  Sf historian Donald Tuck also lists Stanton Coblentz's \"Time Trap\", from the final issue, as notable.Tuck (1982), p. 561.  Ashley suggests that the improvement in the quality of the stories, compared to British science fiction from before the war, was partly because Astounding Science Fiction, which was the leading sf magazine of the day, was available in the UK in a British reprint edition.  The British writers were starting to model their stories after what they read in Astounding\u2014\"no bad thing\", in Ashley's view.", "Gillings included reprints as well as new stories, and a letter column, plus some non-fiction articles which he wrote himself under pseudonyms.  All three issues had a print run of 6,000 copies, and each issue sold out, but paper rationing was still in effect, and Temple Bar decided to close down the magazine and concentrate on more profitable titles.  Gillings had seen the writing on the wall even before the second issue appeared, and in March 1947 produced the first issue of Fantasy Review, a high-quality fanzine.Hansen (2016), p. 79.  Both Fantasy Review and the inventory that Gillings had acquired for Fantasy were eventually put to use when Science Fantasy, a companion magazine to New Worlds, was launched in 1950.Hansen (2016), p. 79.  Fantasy Review was incorporated as a news section in Science Fantasy, and Gillings included one of Clarke's stories, \"Time's Arrow\" in the first issue, along with \"Black Saturday\", by John Russell Fearn, which Gillings had bought in 1947, and \"Monster\" by Christopher Youd (the real name of John Christopher).Hansen (2016), p. 79.Ashley (1985c), p. 505.Harbottle (2001), p. 9.  \"Monster\" had been Youd's first sale when Gillings bought it from him in 1946, but, as with Clarke, his first sale was not his first story to see print: instead Youd's \"Christmas Tree\" appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in February 1949.Ashley (2000), pp. 191\u2013192."]}, {"page": "Columbia Publications", "response": ["In addition to pulp magazines, Columbia published a few paperback books, most notably Noel Loomis' City of Glass (1955) (a \"Double Action Pocketbook\"; originally published in 1942 as a shorter piece in Standard Magazines' Startling Stories) and the five-issue series Science Fiction Classics (1942), which included novellas by Earl Binder and Otto Binder writing as \"John Coleridge,\" and John Russell Fearn writing as \"Dennis Clive\"."]}, {"page": "My Best Science Fiction Story", "response": ["*\"Wanderer of Time\" (1944) (John Russell Fearn)"]}, {"page": "2011 in public domain", "response": ["|John Russell Fearn"]}, {"page": "Philip Harbottle", "response": ["Philip Harbottle (1941-) is a British official best known as a science-fiction researcher and critic specializing in the British science fiction.
