The Shaft guitar part closing out the bridge is a nice touch, too, demonstrating just how effectively Seal has grafted synthesized dance music onto its funk roots.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media called it \"adventurous techno-pop by this promising UK singer who sang on Adamski's recent hit single Killer. Produced by Trevor Horn, this classy, galloping mix of funk, soul and pop is currently riding high on the UK charts. Europe should be next.\" Bob Mack from Spin noted Seal's \"stirring vocal that's being compared to Marvin Gaye\" and added that \"based on a '70s cop-show-type bass synth line, \"Crazy\" flows natch enough that you hum along on first listening.\" Siobhan O'Neill commented on the song in the 2010 book 10,001 Songs You Must Hear\u2026, \"Full of drug and dance scene references, \"Crazy\" blends soulful lyrics and husky vocals with Horn's trademark sweeping orchestration and a voguish electronic backing\u2014a combination that, in the wake of this and Massive Attack, became the template for a whole strand of dance music.\""]}, {"page": "The Suspicions of Mr Whicher", "response": ["* Siobhan O'Neill ...
