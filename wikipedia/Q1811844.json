The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley, and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie \"Mary\" in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, \"In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film\u2014it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what the hell is going on in the film.\" On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced\u2014none of the actors has any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British."]}, {"page": "Terror Firma", "response": ["*Samson Griffin \u2014 Lee Ingleby"]}, {"page": "Ingleby", "response": ["* Lee Ingleby (born 1976), British film, television, and stage actor"]}, {"page": "Chris Lang", "response": ["In 2007, he co-formed TXTV through which he now makes much of his original drama, and through which he co-created, wrote and executive produced Innocent, a four-part thriller starring Lee Ingleby, Hermione Norris, Nigel Lindsay and Angel Coulby. which broadcast on 14\u201317 May 2018 to a consolidated first night audience of 8.05 million, making it the most watched new ITV drama of the year, with The Daily Express calling it - 'Spellbinding...the TV drama that has got the whole nation watching\"."]}, {"page": "List of supporting Harry Potter characters", "response": ["Stan was portrayed by Lee Ingleby in the film adaptation of Prisoner of Azkaban."]}, {"page": "The Headsman", "response": ["*Lee Ingleby as Bernhard"]}, {"page": "Noni R\u0103zvan Ene", "response": ["Noni had a successful stint with Cat Music, mostly with the song Give me the sunlight produced by Sunrise Inc but then signed with Walt Disney Records in 2010 by releasing the Romanian version for \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\" and Sindrum Media in 2012.
