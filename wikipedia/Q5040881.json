He notably played in the top flight for Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Everton and Charlton Athletic as well as other spells for Barnsley, Swindon Town, Sheffield United, Birmingham City and Portsmouth.

It could be argued that Ward's inability to keep his place was not due to his form, more due to his versatility, something that would be as much a burden for Ward as it would a strength, indeed throughout 7 years Ward had played in every area except goal.
