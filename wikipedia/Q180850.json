His career began with a string of top-ten hits in the mid-1960s. He has toured regularly, with appearances in Las Vegas (1967\u20132011). Jones's voice has been described by AllMusic as a \"full-throated, robust baritone\".His performing range has included pop, R&B, show tunes, country, dance, soul and gospel.  In 2008, the New York Times called Jones a musical \"shape shifter\", who could  \"slide from soulful rasp to pop croon, with a voice as husky as it was pretty\". Jones has sold over 100 million records, with 36 Top 40 hits in the UK and 19 in the US, including  \"It's Not Unusual\", \"What's New Pussycat?\", the theme song for the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball, \"Green, Green Grass of Home\", \"Delilah\", \"She's a Lady\", \"Kiss\" and \"Sex Bomb\".Jones has also occasionally dabbled in acting, first making his acting debut playing the lead role in the 1979 television film Pleasure Cove. He also appeared as himself in Tim Burton's 1996 film Mars Attacks!. In 1970 he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy nomination for hosting the television series This Is Tom Jones. In 2012, he played his first dramatic acting role in an episode of Playhouse Presents. Jones received a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966, an MTV Video Music Award in 1989, as well as two Brit Awards: Best British Male in 2000 and the Outstanding Contribution to Music award in 2003. Jones was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music in 2005. Jones experienced a resurgence in notability in the 2010s due to his coaching role on the television talent show The Voice UK from 2012 (with the exception of 2016).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Country music", "response": ["In 1980, a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized by the film Urban Cowboy, which also included more traditional songs such as \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" by the Charlie Daniels Band.Lyricsoncall.com  Lyricsoncall.com It was during this time that a glut of pop-country crossover artists began appearing on the country charts: former pop stars Bill Medley (of the Righteous Brothers), \"England Dan\" Seals (of England Dan and John Ford Coley), Tom Jones, and Merrill Osmond (both alone and with some of his brothers; his younger sister Marie Osmond was already an established country star) all recorded significant country hits in the early 1980s.

Many British singers who performed the occasional country songs are of other genres. Tom Jones, by this point near the end of his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bee Gees had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists (\"Rest Your Love on Me\") and a major hit as songwriters (\"Islands in the Stream\"); Barry Gibb, the band's usual lead singer and last surviving member, acknowledged that country music was a major influence on the band's style. Singer Engelbert Humperdinck, while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with \"After the Lovin',\" achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his covers of Nashville country ballads such as \"Release Me,\" \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" and \"There Goes My Everything.\" The songwriting tandem of Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler initially started her career making country records, and in 1978 her single \"It's a Heartache\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.

The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others wanted more of Carlos's original compositions. Carlos decided, \"If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn't going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music\", and so began a process of \"re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones\". By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument. Released as By Request in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of Carlos's compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of \"Eleanor Rigby\" by The Beatles and \"What's New Pussycat?\", originally sung by Tom Jones. The final track, entitled \"Pompous Circumstances,\" a \"witty and serious\" set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar, was replaced by CBS with tracks from The Well-Tempered Synthesizer on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in this style, which \"devastated\" Carlos.
