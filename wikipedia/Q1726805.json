On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal of the season from a free kick in a 4\u20131 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar S\u00edvori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts. On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2\u20131 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2\u20130 home win over Sampdoria, which saw Juventus crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time. He finished his second league campaign with 31 goals, making him the second-highest goalscorer in the league behind only European Golden Shoe winner Ciro Immobile, with 36 goals. On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2\u20131 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season. Despite the win, the tie finished 2\u20132 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule."]}, {"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["In November 1953, Lawton was traded to First Division champions Arsenal for \u00a37,500 plus James Robertson who was valued at \u00a32,500.

However Lawton was limited to ten appearances in the 1953\u201354 campaign after picking up an injury on his debut.

Herd made his Arsenal debut on 19 February 1955 against Leicester City. Herd continued to be a bit part player, playing just eight games in his first two seasons at the club, before making his breakthrough in 1956\u201357, scoring 18 goals in 28 games that season. From then on he was an established goalscorer, being the club's top goalscorer for four seasons straight, from 1956\u201357 through to 1960\u201361 \u2013 when he hit 29 goals, the most by an Arsenal player since Ronnie Rooke."]}]}}
