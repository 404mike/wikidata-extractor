He was for a number of years the medical officer at Millbank Prison, and later became the chief medical officer of prisons in Western Australia. While living in Australia, he was invited to join a touring All England Eleven, however he declined the invitation. Prior to obtaining his medical qualification, Attfield served as a special constable during the bread riots of 1848. Eventually returning to England and settling at Hove, Sussex, Attfield died at the town on 16 January 1925, just short of his 99th birthday.
