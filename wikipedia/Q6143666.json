He died in Seattle, Washington in 1923.\nCarrick was a genuine all-round sportsman, playing international rugby as a full-back for Scotland, and appeared in a few important cricket matches. He was clearly a highly accomplished player, the only batsman to take a century off Nottinghamshire CCC between 1887 and 1890 when they dominated county cricket.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Glasgow", "response": ["*James Stewart Carrick (1855\u20131923) \u2013 holder of the world record for the highest score"]}, {"page": "Bill Roe (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1868, Edward Tylecote had become the first batsman to score a quadruple century (400 runs) in cricket, when he accumulated 404 not out in an internal match at Clifton College. W. G. Grace had got close to the total in 1876, but ran out of batting partners to finish on 400 not out. In the summer of 1881, Roe achieved his fame, by surpassing them both. In an intercollegiate match between the \"long vacation clubs\" of Gonville and Caius and Emmanuel, Roe was called upon as a guest player for Emmanuel, who had only managed to find nine players. Caius batted first, and were dismissed for 100 runs exactly, Roe taking half of their wickets and Charles Allcock the other half. Roe and Allcock then proceeded to open the batting for Emmanuel, finishing the day on 157 without the loss of either batsman. The next afternoon Roe reached his century early, and then after scoring 200 runs he could have been out three times, but each chance was missed. Against bowling described in the contemporary press as weak, he batted through the rest of the day to finish on 415 not out. The game was played on a ground with no boundaries, so he had to run each of his team's 708 runs, a distance of nearly eight miles. In all, he scored 1 six, 6 fives, 16 fours, 48 threes, 52 twos and 67 ones, but so fastidious was Roe, that when he came off the field at the close of play, he challenged the scorer for crediting him one run short; Roe had counted 416 runs. Roe's record was beaten by James Stewart Carrick in 1885, when the latter scored 419 not out for the West of Scotland against Priory Park, Chichester."]}, {"page": "Thomas Chalmers (rugby)", "response": ["Thomas Chalmers was born in Glasgow, the son of a merchant draper.
