His regular position was as a forward. He was born in Shotts. He played for Dykehead, Wishaw, Clapton Orient, Manchester United and Grimsby Town. Rennox was signed to Manchester United from March 1925 to July 1927.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank McPherson", "response": ["Despite that brief run-out at centre-forward, McPherson played exclusively at outside left in 1924\u201325, missing just four games. He was also a more prolific goalscorer, his seven goals in 38 league appearances helping the club to a second-place finish at the end of the season and promotion back to the First Division. He began the following season as the starting outside left, playing in the first seven games before the re-emergence of Harry Thomas cost him his place, starting with the game against Burnley on 26 September 1925. McPherson made a goalscoring return to the team as a centre-forward on 24 October, scoring twice in a 2\u20130 away win over Cardiff City; he retained the number 9 shirt for much of the rest of the season, before a three-game spell without scoring culminated in a 7\u20130 defeat away to Blackburn Rovers; Charlie Rennox, Jimmy Hanson and Chris Taylor shared centre-forward duties for the remaining six games of the season. Despite being dropped for the final six games, McPherson finished the season with a career-high 16 league goals, and a further four in the FA Cup, in which Manchester United reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by rivals Manchester City. McPherson's new-found scoring form was attributed to his pace, coupled with a change to the offside law, which now only required two defenders between the attacking player and the opposing goal line for the attacker to be onside."]}, {"page": "Clatworthy Rennox", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlie Rennox"]}]}}
