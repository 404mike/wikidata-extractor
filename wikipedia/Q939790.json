While working on the show Peter Egan noted that Snoad had a very different technique to Lotterby saying that while Lotterby was an introvert Snoad was an extrovert. In 1988 Snoad directed and produced the television film Wife begins at 40, for this Snoad again worked with Ray Cooney, who he had worked with in Not Now, Comrade.
