After Charles' death in 1824, the firm was taken over by his brother Daniel who was subsequently forced to resign after he married his Chinese mistress and brought the family into disrepute. That left Hollingworth in charge but the firm was in disarray. p. 221 Wishing to leave Asia, Hollingworth went in search of competent partners to join his firm. Previously, Scottish merchant William Jardine had helped Daniel Magniac by sending his young son Daniel Francis, his child by his Chinese wife, to Scotland for schooling. After an extensive search for a senior partner, Hollingworth settled on Jardine,p. 20 whose business reputation was already well known throughout Asia. Magniac and Jardine also invited James Matheson to join the firm. Magniac returned to England in 1828 with the firm in the hands of two of the most talented traders in Asia. Contrary to the practice at the time of retiring partners removing their capital from the firm, Hollingworth left his capital in trust to Jardine and Matheson. The firm remained as Magniac and Co. until 1832, as the name was still formidable throughout China and India. The partnership was then restructured to become Jardine, Matheson & Co. which would go on to become the largest trading company in Asia p. 6 and later a Fortune 500 listed company."]}, {"page": "Thomas Chay Beale", "response": ["Chay Beale was a nephew of opium trader and merchant Daniel Beale and his brother Thomas Beale.
