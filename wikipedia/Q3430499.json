His book The Knight and Chivalry, about the interplay between history and literature, won the Somerset Maugham Award, a well-known British literary prize, in 1971. A similarly-themed 2004 book, The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief, was widely praised in the UK press, and received major reviews in The New York Times and The New Republic.Barber has long specialised in Arthurian legend, beginning with the general survey, Arthur of Albion (1961). His other major interest is historical biography: he has published Henry Plantagenet (1964) and a biography of Edward, the Black Prince, Edward Prince of Wales and Aquitaine  (1978). Recent biographical books are Edward III and the Triumph of England: The Battle of Cr\u00e9cy and the Order of the Garter (2013), which includes a reappraisal of the origins of the Order, and Henry II in the Penguin Monarchs series (2015). His latest book is Magnificence and Princely Splendour in the Middle Ages (2020).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward the Black Prince", "response": ["The Victorian historian William Hunt, author of Prince Edward's biography in the Dictionary of National Biography (1889), relying on Froissart as a source, wrote that when the bishop (who was the most responsible for the surrender) was brought before the Prince, the Prince told him that his head should be cut off (Lancaster persuaded him not to carry out the deed), but that the city was nevertheless pillaged and burnt, and that 3,000 persons of all ranks and ages were massacred. However, modern scholarship, including the historian Richard Barber writing in 2008 in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and drawing on a wider range of evidence, places casualties much lower than Froissart did\u2014around 300 garrison soldiers and civilians in total.; and ", "The black field of his \"shield for peace\" is well documented (see Arms and heraldic badge above). However, there is no sound evidence that Edward ever wore black armour, although John Harvey (without citing a source) refers to \"some rather shadowy evidence that he was described in French as clad at the battle of Cr\u00e9cy ' en armure noire en fer bruni ' \u2013 in black armour of burnished steel\". Richard Barber suggests that the name's origins may have lain in pageantry, in that a tradition may have grown up in the 15th century of representing the prince in black armour. He points out that several chronicles refer to him as Edward the IV (the title he would have taken as King had he outlived his father): this name would obviously have become confusing when the actual Edward IV succeeded in 1461, and this may have been the period when an alternative had to be found."]}, {"page": "Avalon", "response": ["Accounts of the exact inscription vary, with five different versions existing. One popular today, made famous by Malory, claims \"Here lies Arthur, the king that was and the king that shall be\" (Hic iacet Arthurus, rex quondam rexque futurus), also known in the now-popular variant \"the once and future king\" (rex quondam et futurus). The earliest is by Gerald in Liber de Principis instructione c.\u00a01193, who wrote that he viewed the cross in person and traced the lettering. His transcript reads: \"Here lies buried the famous Arthurus with Wenneveria his second wife in the isle of Avalon\" (Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arthurus cum Wenneveria uxore sua secunda in insula Avallonia). He wrote that inside the coffin were two bodies, whom Giraldus refers to as Arthur and \"his queen\"; the bones of the male body were described as being gigantic. The account of the burial by the chronicle of Margam Abbey says three bodies were found, the other being that of Mordred; Richard Barber argues that Mordred's name was airbrushed out of the story once his reputation as a traitor was appreciated.Richard Barber, \"Was Mordred buried at Glastonbury?: Arthurian tradition at Glastonbury in the middle ages\", in  The story is today seen as an example of pseudoarchaeology. Historians generally dismiss the authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which had been mostly burned in 1184.Modern scholarship views the Glastonbury cross as the result of a late 12th-century fraud.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp.105-106 He held that the Ghibellines, who had fought the Guelph for control of Northern and Central Italy in the thirteenth century, had within them the residual influences of pre-Christian Celtic and Nordic traditions that represented his conception of the Grail myth. He also held that the Guelph victory against the Ghibellines represented a regression of the castes, since the merchant caste took over from the warrior caste. In the epilogue to this book, Evola argued that the fictitious The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, regardless of whether it was authentic or not, was a cogent representation of modernity. The historian Richard Barber said, Evola mixes rhetoric, prejudice, scholarship, and politics into a strange version of the present and future, but in the process he brings together for the first time interest in the esoteric and in conspiracy theory which characterize much of the later Grail literature."]}, {"page": "John Aubrey", "response": ["A large part of the \"Lives\" was published in 1813 as Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.

Others doubt this, however, and a compromise theory postulates a more secular writer who had spent some time in a Cistercian monastery.Karen Pratt, The Cistercians and the Queste del Saint Graal.

Powell was known to have had repairs carried out to make the unstable abbey ruins safe and the appearance of the Nanteos Cup \"coincided quite closely\" with these repairs. Richard Barber, a historian specialising in Arthurian legends, has also proposed that the cup was probably discovered at the site of the abbey in the 19th century. John Thomas Evans, in his The Church Plate of Cardiganshire (1914), suggested that the cup may have been passed to the Powell family from the Stedman family, who owned the Strata Florida estate, when Richard Stedman died in 1746: Wood points out that there is no record of the cup in any will or inventory of the Stedman or Powell families."]}, {"page": "Juliet Barker", "response": ["* with Richard Barber: Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages (1989)The Boydell Press, "]}, {"page": "Kairo-k\u014d", "response": ["Kairo-k\u014d was translated into English by Toshiyuki Takamiya and Andrew Armour for the volume Arthurian Literature II, edited by Richard Barber and published in 1982.S\u014dseki."]}]}}
