John Hall, a former conservative premier, moved a Bill to enact women's suffrage. Seddon's opponents within the party, led by Stout (also an advocate of temperance), managed to gather enough support for the Bill to be passed despite Seddon's opposition. When Seddon realised that the passage of the bill was inevitable, he changed his position, claiming to accept the people's will. In actuality, however, he took strong measures to ensure that the Legislative Council would vote down the Bill, as it had done previously. Seddon's tactics in lobbying the council were seen by many as underhand, and two Councillors, despite opposing suffrage, voted in favour of the bill in protest. The Bill was granted Royal Assent in September.", "Although Chinese immigrants were invited to New Zealand by the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce, prejudice against them quickly led to calls for restrictions on immigration. Following the example of anti-Chinese poll taxes enacted by California in 1852 and by Australian states in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, John Hall's government passed the Chinese Immigration Act 1881. This imposed a \u00a310 tax per Chinese person entering New Zealand, and permitted only one Chinese immigrant for every 10 tons of cargo. Richard Seddon's government increased the tax to \u00a3100 per head in 1896, and tightened the other restriction to only one Chinese immigrant for every 200 tons of cargo."]}, {"page": "Parihaka", "response": ["Hearings began at Oeo, South Taranaki, in February, but were immediately boycotted by Te Whiti's followers when the commission refused to travel to Parihaka to hold discussions. Historian Dick Scott has claimed Fox, who had already expressed in writing his wish that the Waimate Plains be sold and settled, was appointed chairman of the commission on the proviso that he support the government's land policies in the area and secure central Taranaki for white settlement. Correspondence to Premier John Hall shows that Fox thought it futile to give a hearing to \"every Native who thinks he has a grievance\" and was keen to ensure commission hearings did not delay road-building works in the Waimate Plains that could be carried out in summer.Richmond-Atkinson papers, G.

John Bryce, Robert Stout and William Rolleston had all lost their seats. Sir John Hall said he was too old. Sir Julius Vogel's policies had been rejected by the voters. So there was no alternative to Harry Atkinson, and after two weeks of negotiations he announced a ministry on 11 October. Only two ministers had served with him before. The Scarecrow Ministry was not expected to last, but did. The years 1887 and 1888 were the worst of the Long Depression, and Atkinson cut salaries, raised loans and raised customs duties. He was not popular with the wealthy, but they feared the Opposition leaders Grey and Ballance even more."]}, {"page": "John Hall", "response": ["John Hall may refer to:", "* John Hall (NYU President) (fl. c. 1890), American academic", "* John Hall (British Army officer) (1795\u20131866), British military surgeon", "* John Hall (Maryland politician) (1729\u20131797), delegate to the Continental Congress", "* John Hall (New York politician) (born 1948), U.S. Representative from New York", "* John Hall (West Virginia politician) (1805\u20131881), Virginia politician and West Virginia founder", "* John Hall (1632\u20131711), British MP for Wells, 1671\u20131679 and 1680\u20131685", "* John Hall (Buckingham MP) (1799\u20131872), British general and MP for Buckingham, 1846\u20131859", "* John Hall (Labour politician) (1896\u20131955), MP for Gateshead West, 1950\u20131955", "* John Hall (Wycombe MP) (1911\u20131978)", "* John Hall (New South Wales politician) (1856\u20131921)", "* John Hall (New Zealand politician) (1824\u20131907)", "* John Hall (Victorian politician) (1884\u20131949)", "* John Hall (minister) (c. 1559\u20131627), Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland", "* John Hall (bishop) (1633\u20131710), English churchman and academic", "* John Hall (Presbyterian pastor) (1829\u20131898), Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York City", "* John Hall (Archdeacon of Salop) (born 1941)", "* John Hall (priest) (born 1949), British Anglican Church leader", "* John Hall (Archdeacon of Killaloe) (1626\u20131691), Church of Ireland priest", "* John Hall (physician) (1575\u20131636), William Shakespeare's son-in-law and medical author", "* John Hall (engineer) (1765\u20131836), English engineer and millwright", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1815) (1815\u20131888), English first-class cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1874) (1874\u20131925), English cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1903) (1903\u20131979), English cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1934), English cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1950), English cricketer", "* John Hall (1930s footballer), winger who played for Burnley", "* John Hall (footballer, born 1944), Bradford City A.F.C. footballer", "* John Hall (footballer, born 1994), Adelaide United FC footballer", "* John Hall (placekicker) (born 1974), American football kicker", "* John Hall (baseball) (1924\u20131995), for the 1948 Brooklyn Dodgers", "* John Hall (sport shooter) (1906\u20131978), British Olympic shooter", "* John Halle (died 1568), called also John Hall of Maidstone, English surgeon, known as a medical writer and poet", "* John Hall (poet) (1627\u20131656), English poet, essayist and pamphleteer", "* N.
