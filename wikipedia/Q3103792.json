David's involvement with the law profession and later his career as a writer mirror the experiences of Dickens. Many of David's acquaintances are based on people Dickens actually knew. David's first wife, Dora Spenlow, is believed to be based upon Maria Beadnell, whom Dickens loved in his early youth. David's friend since boyhood and his second wife, Agnes Wickfield, the real heroine of the novel, is based on Dickens' sisters-in-law Mary and Georgina Hogarth; both of whom were very close to Dickens. Dickens keenly felt his deprived education during his time at the blacking factory, and according to the authoritative biography by his lifelong friend and literary advisor John Forster, it was from these times that he drew David's working period."]}, {"page": "Walter Goodman (artist)", "response": ["In contrast to James Hannay, Wilkie Collins was a very talkative, if less attractive (by his own admission) subject. The Collins portrait would take two years to complete. The sittings were interrupted by Goodman's severe illness in 1881 and Collins' own struggle with gout. Goodman moved temporarily to Broadstairs to recover, whilst Collins went to live in nearby Ramsgate. Goodman suggested they meet up, in either town, but Collins was reluctant to travel to Broastairs as it reminded him too much of his dear departed friends and Broadstairs housemates, Charles Dickens and Augustus Egg. Goodman went to Ramsgate, where Collins related many a fascinating tale of his friendship with Dickens. For example, it was at Broadstairs that Dickens came upon the original aunt in David Copperfield. Some of Dickens' seafaring experiences were derived from chats with the old boatmen on the jetty. Prior to this portrait being exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists, after Collins' death in 1889, it was privately shown at Goodman's studio to a number of Collins' personal friends. These included Georgina Hogarth and Mary Dickens. In his final letter to Goodman, Collins states  I am very glad to hear that Miss Hogarth likes the portrait.
