Emmott's career started in the silent era and continued through to the mid-1960s.  His most prolific decade was the 1930s, when he was involved with almost 120 films, many of which were produced by noted documentary film-maker John Grierson.\nEmmott worked mainly in the field of quota quickies and B-movies.  His output covered the entire spectrum of film genres, from comedy and musicals, through melodrama and thrillers, to crime and horror films.  Directors Emmott worked with included Michael Powell, Arthur B. Woods, Val Guest and Lance Comfort.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Grierson", "response": ["In late 1929 Grierson and his cameraman, Basil Emmott completed his first film, Drifters, which he wrote, produced and directed. The film, which follows the heroic work of North Sea herring fishermen, was a radical departure from anything being made by the British film industry or Hollywood. A large part of its innovation lies in the fierce boldness in bringing the camera to rugged locations such as a small boat in the middle of a gale while leaving relatively less of the action staged. The choice of topic was chosen less from Grierson's curiosity than the fact that he discovered that the Financial Secretary had made the herring industry his hobbyhorse. It premiered in a private film club in London in November 1929 on a double-bill with Eisenstein's -then controversial- film The Battleship Potemkin (which was banned from general release in Britain until 1954) and received high praise from both its sponsors and the press. The film was shown from 9 December 1929, in the Stoll in Kingsway and then was later screened throughout Britain."]}]}}
