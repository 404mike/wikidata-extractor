He won one major title, the Las Vegas Desert Classic, in 2003, and twice held the number one ranking. He also reached the World Championship final in 1999, 2002 and 2006, losing to Phil Taylor on each occasion. Declining form led to him losing his place on the PDC tour in 2011. \nManley was nicknamed \"One Dart\" by commentator Tony Green after hitting the winning double on numerous occasions with his first dart during his first televised appearance at the 1995 Unipart European Masters, where he eventually lost in the final to Mike Gregory. Manley was also known for his walk on and personality.

These three years were marked by two distinct and contrasting fortunes; first, Part enjoyed some success over his rival Taylor, securing a number of televised victories over his nemesis. However, he was unable to consolidate these victories in the major events, and in fact failed to add a single major title to his name from February 2003 through 2005. There were minor successes; Part won the first event he entered \u2013 the UK Open Southwest Regional Final \u2013 after his world championship triumph, beating Taylor along the way, and later in 2003 added the Windy City Open and two Vauxhall Opens to his silverware collection. But the major titles were not forthcoming. Part recorded another victory over Taylor in the 2003 Las Vegas Desert Classic semi-final, but lost in the final 16\u201312 in legs as Peter Manley took the crown. There were disappointing exits in the last sixteen of the 2003 UK Open and the 2003 World Matchplay, though Part made a second consecutive appearance in the World Grand Prix final. However, Taylor again comfortably defeated Part in this event, winning the final 7\u20132. At this point, Taylor had also retaken the world number one ranking from Part.", "Part endured a barren 2005, failing to win a single tournament anywhere throughout the year. In the 2005 PDC World Championship, Part reached the last sixteen but came up against Dudbridge again. The Bristolian had become something of a b\u00eate noire to Part's world championship attempts, and Dudbridge beat Part again, by a 4\u20132 scoreline (Taylor eventually defeated Dudbridge in the final). Following the world championship, Part was invited into the inaugural Premier League, but it was not a happy campaign. Despite being in a good position after 4\u20135 weeks, Part then lost six successive matches towards the latter end of the league and finished sixth out of the seven participants. For Part, the highlights of 2005 were two of his most renowned televised clashes against Taylor. While 'The Power' was dominating the televised events, Part was sliding down the rankings somewhat. Nevertheless, Part proved to be Taylor's only consistent challenger during this time. In June, Part outplayed Taylor to lead 4\u20130, 7\u20131 and 10\u20136 in legs during their match in the Last 16 of the 2005 UK Open, but Taylor produced a remarkable comeback to win 11\u201310 and went on to win the tournament. Part avenged this defeat in July with an all-time classic quarter-final in the 2005 World Matchplay. Though Taylor led 4\u20131 in the early stages, Part hit back to lead 5\u20134 and 7\u20135. After Taylor drew level at 7\u20137, the two players traded legs thereafter until they were matched at 11\u201311. Part then started to pull away and won five straight legs to achieve a 16\u201311 victory over 'The Power', ending Taylor's 27-match winning streak in the World Matchplay, inflicting Taylor's first defeat at the World Matchplay since 1999. After defeating Taylor, Part faced Peter Manley in the semi finals, a match that was hyped up as a rematch of the 2003 Las Vegas Desert Classic final that Part had lost to Manley. Manley won his 2005 World Matchplay quarter final match against Wayne Mardle after coming back from 9\u201314 down to win 16\u201314. In the semi final, Part also led Manley by 14\u20139, and Manley threatened a similar comeback against Part as what he had done against Mardle by getting it back to 14\u201314 and Manley even went in front at 16\u201315. Part eventually won the match in a tiebreak, 18\u201316, to get through to the final. Part, however, was yet again a runner-up in the tournament, as Colin Lloyd beat Part 18\u201312 in the final, with Lloyd hitting a 170 checkout in the final leg.", "The year 2006 was seminal to both the Professional Darts Corporation, and Part's career. Concerning the former, it heralded the arrival of four-times BDO World Champion Raymond van Barneveld to the PDC. With van Barneveld's arrival and his immediate impact in the 2006 Premier League, Part was no longer perceived as Taylor's main rival (indeed, Part has not beaten Taylor in a televised match since his 2005 World Matchplay victory). Part's shaken status was not helped by a defeat in the third round of the 2006 PDC World Championship to Wayne Mardle. Despite these setbacks, Part's career experienced a somewhat fitful renewal in the three years that followed. In July, he won his first major title since the 2003 World Championship with victory in the 2006 Las Vegas Desert Classic. The Desert Classic had long been a fruitful tournament for Part; in its eight-year history he reached six semi-finals, but it was only in 2006 that he won the trophy. In 2003, he had lost out in the final to Peter Manley having beaten Phil Taylor in the semi-final; this time it was van Barneveld's turn to suffer the same fate. The Dutchman had beaten Taylor in the semi-final, and in a tense final initially matched Part 3\u20133. However, the Canadian won nine of the next eleven legs to secure a 6\u20133 victory and his second major title in the PDC.", "In a tournament where the contemporary superpowers of the game had faltered \u2013 Taylor had lost 5\u20134 to Wayne Mardle in the quarter-finals and reigning champion van Barneveld had been eliminated by Painter in the third round \u2013 it was perhaps not such a great surprise to see a 500\u20131 rank outsider facing Part in the final. Debutant Kirk Shepherd, a 21-year-old qualifier and the sport's youngest ever world-finalist, was Part's opponent. In a sense, Part's career had come full circle; the matchup recalled his 1994 final, though Part had moved from novice to established veteran and Shepherd, this time, was the young debutant. But Part was not to suffer the same fate as Bobby George had. While Shepherd had shown remarkable guile, moxie and perhaps good fortune in defeating stalwarts of the PDC's top 10, including Mardle, Peter Manley, and Terry Jenkins, the experience of Part proved a step too far. The Canadian raced into a 4\u20130 lead and though Shepherd brought the match back to 5\u20132, Part closed out the match before the comeback could become troubling, winning the final two sets for a 7\u20132 victory and a third world championship. Victory ensured he joined Taylor, van Barneveld, Eric Bristow and John Lowe as the fifth player to have won more than two world championships. With this win he also became the second player to have won the PDC World Championship more than once, after Taylor. Part also set a new record in becoming the first player to win the world championship in three different venues \u2013 having won the 1994 BDO World Championship at the Lakeside, the 2003 PDC title at the Circus Tavern and in 2008 at Alexandra Palace."]}, {"page": "Las Vegas Desert Classic", "response": ["Phil Taylor won the title five times out of the eight years the event was staged.
