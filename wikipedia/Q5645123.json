His first recorded appearance for a representative county side was in August 1877, when he played for Somerset, against their Dorset neighbours. He opened the batting for the Somerset team alongside Hamilton Ross. Both had been scoring plenty of runs for Lansdown in club cricket,Roebuck (1991), p. 19. and Sainsbury made 32, a respectable score in the match, which Somerset won by an innings. Only Edward Lloyd scored more, posting an unbeaten 110, one of the earliest centuries scored for a Somerset county side. Sainsbury also opened the bowling during the match, but he claimed only one wicket over the two innings and bowled just 13 of the 104 overs. A few days later he appeared again for the county side, against Clifton, who had the Australian Test cricketer, Billy Midwinter, in their team. Sainsbury scored 96 not out, including a \"resolute\" partnership with Stephen Newton, before rain forced the game to be drawn. Subsequently, he scored 7 and 81 against the Wiltshire Wanderers, and took ten wickets in the match, including six in the first innings. In two further appearances for Somerset in 1877, Sainsbury did not surpass the score he reached against Dorset but claimed two further wickets, both against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire. Sainsbury finished the season top of Somerset's batting averages, having scored 230 runs at an average of 46.00."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1890", "response": ["| Hamilton Ross || style=\"text-align:center\"| ||  || Right-handed || \u2013 ||"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1891", "response": ["| Hamilton Ross ||  ||  || Right-handed || \u2014"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1883", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Hamilton Ross "]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Hamilton Ross (1874)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Hamilton Ross (1879\u20131889) : H.
