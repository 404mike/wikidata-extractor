He was also an influential communist activist within the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\nHis oeuvre includes three symphonies, several concertos, part-songs, songs, chamber music and opera (which he called \"music drama\" after Wagner). His best known work was the opera The Immortal Hour. His Bethlehem (1915), based on the Coventry Nativity Play and notable for its choral arrangements of traditional Christmas carols, also became very popular with choral societies worldwide.\nAmong his many works, the prolific Boughton composed a complete series of five operas of Arthurian mythos, written over a period of thirty-five years: The Birth of Arthur (1909), The Round Table (1915\u201316), The Lily Maid (1933\u201334), Galahad  (1943\u201344) and Avalon (1944\u201345). Other operas by Boughton include The Moon Maiden (1918); Alkestis (1920\u201322); and The Ever Young (1928\u201329).Through the Boughton Trust (see below), many of his major works have been recorded and are available on disc including The Immortal Hour, Bethlehem, Symphony No 1 Oliver Cromwell, Symphony No 2 Deirdre, Symphony No 3, Oboe Concerto No 1, string quartets and various chamber pieces and songs.\nIn addition to his compositions, Boughton is remembered for his attempt to create an \"English Bayreuth\" at Glastonbury, establishing the first series of Glastonbury Festivals. They ran with enormous success from 1914 until 1926 when support for his musical activities dried up after he joined the CPGB.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 23", "response": ["*1878 \u2013 Rutland Boughton, English composer (d. 1960)"]}, {"page": "1960", "response": ["** Rutland Boughton, English composer (b. 1878)"]}, {"page": "1878", "response": ["* January 23 \u2013 Rutland Boughton, English composer (d. 1960)"]}, {"page": "List of prominent operas", "response": ["* 1914 The Immortal Hour (Rutland Boughton).

Arnold Schoenberg used a complex set of leitmotifs in his choral work Gurre-Lieder (completed 1911). Alban Berg's opera Wozzeck (1914\u20131922) also utilizes leitmotifs. The leitmotif was also a major feature of the opera The Immortal Hour by the English composer Rutland Boughton.
