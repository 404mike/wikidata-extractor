The bulk of his career (seven seasons) was spent with Heart of Midlothian,John (Jack) Sharp, London Hearts Supporters Club with the closest he came to winning a trophy being an appearance on the losing side in the final of the 1919 Victory Cup  (although a one-off wartime competition, this had some prestige as it was held after World War I had ended, and the regular Scottish Cup was not contested during the war years). Sharp also played for Albion Rovers, and bookended his time in the senior leagues with spells at Bathgate."]}]}}
