In 1973, he joined top flight Wolverhampton Wanderers for \u00a345,000. Here, he was largely second choice to Phil Parkes, but after Parkes suffered injury, he played in the 1974 League Cup Final. Pierce made a series of outstanding saves in the game, helping Wolves defeat Manchester City 2\u20131 at Wembley.\nPierce was an ever-present in the 1976\u201377 season as Wolves won the Second Division at the first attempt, but the club bought Paul Bradshaw upon their return, relegating Pierce to reserve status again. He left Molineux in 1979 for Third Division Barnsley, where he played three seasons, before ending his league career with a season at Blackpool.\nAt Blackpool, he made 27 consecutive League appearances during the 1983\u201384 campaign as Sam Ellis' fourth goalkeeping change in seventeen matches. He took over from the on-loan Barry Siddall on 26 November 1983, as the Seasiders won 2\u20131 at Hereford United. His final game for the club occurred on 5 May 1984, a 3\u20132 defeat at Aldershot. Drew Brand became Blackpool's fifth goalkeeper used that season when he took over for the three remaining League games. His contract was cancelled later that month and his professional career was over at the age of 33.Pierce then returned to non-league football with Accrington Stanley, Rossendale United and Chorley. In 1986, he returned to his original club Mossley and played through the 1986\u201387 season before retiring from playing completely.\nAfter retiring as a player, he later had a spell as manager of Netherfield but is now no longer involved in football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gary Pierce", "response": ["The Maricopa (County) Association of Government's awarded Gary Pierce (R-Mesa, Arizona) the coveted Peak Award (Summit Award) in 2004.
