The Crown granted him over 3,000 acres of land in County Kerry and elsewhere in Munster, including Killagha Abbey.James Carmody, 'The Abbey of Killagha, Parish of Kilcoleman, County Kerry', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Fifth Series, Vol. 36, No. 3, 290Michael C. O'Laughlin, Families of Co. Kerry, Ireland (Irish Roots Cafe, 1994), 137. The family's secure financial position facilitated marriages with several Old English Munster dynasties. Another descendant, Walter Spring, married a daughter of the Knight of Kerry and was involved in the Irish Confederate Wars, consequently forfeiting much of his land. His descendants married into the Anglo-Irish Rice family, establishing the Spring Rice family. This branch was raised to the peerage as Barons Monteagle of Brandon, after the Whig politician Thomas Spring Rice had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Spring Rices owned 6,445 acres in County Limerick, 2,000 acres in County Kerry and a further 2,000 acres elsewhere in Ireland. The second Lord Monteagle was a Liberal Unionist politician who helped to found the Irish Dominion League.D.

Future generations sat in the House of Lords as both Liberals and Conservatives until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. Sir Cecil Spring Rice (1859\u20131918) was the British Ambassador to the United States during the First World War, while his cousin, Thomas Spring Rice, 3rd Baron Monteagle of Brandon held minor diplomatic office. The 3rd Baron's sister was the Irish nationalist activist, Mary Spring Rice. The sixth baron, Gerald Spring Rice (1926\u20132013) was an officer in the Irish Guards."]}]}}
