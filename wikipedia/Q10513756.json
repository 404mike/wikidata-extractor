It began with a good away point at Watford, courtesy of another McGugan belter. Then Forest played Coventry City at home. It began with a Chambers own goal, but this was put right a few later with a great strike from Majewski. Chris Cohen then bagged his first goal of the season to give Forest a 2\u20131 win. Forest fought out a 0\u20130 draw with the league leaders Queens Park Rangers and then played the league leaders again but this time it was Cardiff City away. McGugan yet again scored from outside the area to give Forest a first half lead and then Blackstock got a late goal to secure the win. However the afternoon ended a sour note with Blackstock getting a bad leg injury, ruling him out for the rest of the season. This paved the way for Nialle Rodney to make his first ever Football League appearance, albeit only for a few minutes. Forest made two mid-season loan signings on 25 November, the loan signing deadline. These were in the form of Sheffield Wednesday striker Marcus Tudgay with a view to a permanent deal  and Arsenal wonderkid Aaron Ramsey on loan till January. However these two new faces couldn't help Forest again ending the month badly due to their away form, losing 1\u20130 to local team Leicester City.", "The draw for the First Round of the League Cup was made on 16 June, with Forest playing the same team as last season, but this time it would be played at Bradford City's Coral Windows Stadium. Forest scored first in this fixture with the goal coming from young midfielder Matt Thornhill with a well placed finish. However, the home team managed to get an equaliser to take the game to extra time and then got the winner to progress to the next round, despite an encouraging performance from Forest. Also in this fixture, young players Nialle Rodney, Kieron Freeman and Robbie Gibbons all made it onto the bench for their first time in their careers, although they did not make an appearance.", "|43 ||FW || Nialle Rodney ||  Burton Albion || 8 March 2011 || 5 April 2011"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|-||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Nialle Rodney", "| Nialle Rodney", "| Nialle Rodney", "| Nialle Rodney", "| Nialle Rodney"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["*14 June 2011: Young players Nialle Rodney and Mark Byrne were released from their contracts, with Byrne joining Barnet, and Rodney going to Bradford City.", "| ||FW || Nialle Rodney ||  Bradford City || Released || 14 June 2011"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["The Bantams were drawn against League Two side Hartlepool United for the First Round however they were knocked out as the League Two side hammered the Bantams 5\u20130 with ex Bradford players Jack Compton and Nialle Rodney among the scorers."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 July 2013 || FW || Nialle Rodney || Telford United || Free || "]}, {"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.
