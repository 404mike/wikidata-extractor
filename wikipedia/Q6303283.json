There was no buildup to their marriage; Ken returned from Scotland and introduced Janet as his wife. The storyline's fast pace angered Roache; he once stressed: \"I was very cross about the whole thing. There was no wedding, she just arrived, no build-up to it. It was just like an idea that was shoved in. I wasn't happy.\" The storyline was unpopular with viewers, who did not approve of the wedding. Janet was already an unpopular character by then, because of her previous affairs with two other Coronation Street males. Barker said Janet was often perceived as treating Ken unfairly. She openly showed her dislike for his children and sent them to boarding school. The situation saw Ken realise he was in a \"loveless marriage\"\u00a0\u2013 a match made whilst feeling lonely and under the presumption that she was his last chance of happiness. The breakdown of their marriage was accompanied by what Little dubbed \"a series of spectacular rows\", which saw Ken become violent towards Janet.Little 1995, p.116. One such row, which followed Ken's discovery of Janet's plans to send the twins to boarding school, was later used as an exercise in drama schools, which Roache deemed \"a nice compliment to everyone involved in creating the moment.\"Roache 2010, p.109."]}, {"page": "Brookside (TV series)", "response": ["Following the huge ratings success of the 'body under the patio' and lesbian kiss plots, writers persisted with controversial, headline-grabbing subjects that other British soaps did not.

Bel sought revenge by selling a story to the press falsely accusing Ollie of abusing Nat and Georgia as children, precipitating their incestuous relationship. The writers persevered with the remainder of the Simpson family, with Ollie meeting the Parade's new solicitor Eleanor Kitson (Georgia Reece), and she moved into number 9 with Ollie and Danny.
