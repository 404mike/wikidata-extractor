He was capped by Worcestershire in 1938, and by Lancashire in 1946.\nKing made a quiet first-class debut for Worcestershire against Northamptonshire in August 1935, scoring just 3 in his only innings.\nHe appeared twice more that season, though did nothing of note, and although he played 20 games in 1936 and 1937 he made only two half-centuries: 51 not out against Surrey in July 1936\nand 50* versus Essex the following month.1938 was a considerably more successful summer for King. He passed a thousand runs for the first time, hitting 1,178 at an average of 22.65, and scoring his maiden century, 104 against Kent at Tonbridge in June.\nHe also made 124 against Hampshire at Worcester later in the season.\nOn this occasion, he reached his hundred before lunch.Although King just failed to repeat the thousand in 1939, hitting 974 runs, he scored another two hundreds that summer.\nIn early July he took over the gloves from George Abell during the match against Surrey, and effected five dismissals.\nKing was named as wicket-keeper in four other matches that year.When first-class cricket resumed after the war, King offered to return to Worcestershire on condition he was paid one pound for every run over a thousand he scored, but the county refused to accept.\nInstead, he moved to Lancashire, for whom he had a successful 1946. He scored 1,145 runs at almost 31, and again struck two centuries. The higher of these was the career-best 145 he made versus Gloucestershire in May; he scored a hundred runs before lunch on the third day, having begun the morning on 34*.King's final season of 1947 was not particularly successful: he made only 360 runs in 17 innings and passed 50 just twice. After that he retired from playing and took a position as a cricket and rugby league columnist with the People newspaper. In this role he twice accompanied the Great Britain team to Australia, and he was preparing for a third such tour when his life was claimed by a heart attack at the early age of 54.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip King", "response": ["Philip or Phil King may refer to:", "* Phil King (cricketer) (1915\u20131970), English cricketer", "* Phil King (American football) (1936\u20131973), American football player", "* Phil King (Texas politician) (born 1956), American politician and jurist", "* Phil King (musician) (born 1960), English bass guitarist", "* Phil King (footballer) (born 1967), British footballer"]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": [":1938: Phil King"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Lancashire finished third for the second season in succession. They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only Geoff Edrich performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, Jack Ikin and captain Ken Cranston scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman Dick Pollard who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer William Roberts bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but Playfair remarked that he was short of Test class. As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow and there were good reports of Alan Wharton who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons. Batsman Barry Howard played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain Nigel Howard, Tom Brierley, Phil King in his final season, future Test umpire Eddie Phillipson, Eric Price, and Gordon Garlick who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.Playfair, pp. 87\u201388."]}]}}
