In 2005 he switched to the SEAT team, moving up a place to 9th with 1 race win. For 2006 he moved to the British GT Championship driving a Panoz Esperante for the LNT team. He immediately established himself as one of the front runners along with his team mate Tom Kimber-Smith and led the championship after a pair of wins at Mondello Park. Hines and Kimber-Smith ended the year second in the standings, missing out on the title by just two points. Hines returned to British GT in 2008, partnering Jeremy Metcalfe in a Ferrari F430 GT3 and finishing runner-up a second time.

The team was renamed once more and was relaunched as CR Scuderia, reflecting their choice of Italian Ferraris for their entry into grand tourer racing.  CR Scuderia employed defending multiple drivers to cover their two new series as well as their continuing efforts in Formula Renault.
