At a time when stories about gypsies were common in nineteenth-century Victorian literature, Pickering achieved her greatest success with the novel Nan Darrell, or The Gypsy Mother (1839). Her books mixed history and romance in the style of Sir Walter Scott.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1843 in literature", "response": ["*November 25 \u2013 Ellen Pickering, English novelist (born 1801 or 1802)"]}, {"page": "1839 in literature", "response": ["*Ellen Pickering"]}, {"page": "Heiress", "response": ["* The Heiress, a novel by Ellen Pickering"]}, {"page": "Mary Poovey", "response": ["Poovey conducted a public re-evaluation in 1999 at the British Women Writers Conference as a theoretical exercise of a writer's work. Poovey re-read the works of Ellen Pickering and decided that they were not worth reviving. This novelist's works had been popular in the 19th century but she considered the books to be over-complicated and lacking in innovation. She concluded that the only reason to re-read works like this was to confirm that the books that we had chosen to remember, like Jane Eyre and Mary Barton, are the best of their type. Poovey used her re-reading of Pickering's novels to argue that not all writers need to be revived into the literary canon. Tamara Wagner went on to argue that this shows that we need to debunk our \"history of reading these texts back from reality\"?"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Youatt", "response": ["In 1851 she married the younger William Henry Coates who was secretary to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.
