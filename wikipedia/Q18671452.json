It was likened by several critics to that of musical glasses. A critic in the Quarterly Musical Magazine, probably Richard Mackenzie Bacon, wrote in 1823 that \"When I hear such a singer as Miss Stephens or Mrs. Salmon, the power of ductility seems carried to its utmost. There are no roughnesses, no breaks--the metal is drawn out exactly, and if we could run it along between the finger and the thumb, or pass the nail over the surface, it would be as even, as smooth, and as polished to the touch as it is brilliant to the ear.\" This description rules out any possibility of vibrato. Henry Phillips wrote that when Thomas Lindsay Willman, the clarinettist, accompanied Mrs. Salmon, it was difficult at times to distinguish the voice from the instrument. But Mrs. Salmon was no musician, although perfectly drilled into everything the orchestra then required. She gave no character to anything she sang."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Poole (singer)", "response": ["In August 1839 she sailed for North America, appearing in nine operas at New York's Park Theatre, including Adina in L'elisir d'amore, and winning audience hearts. Returning to Britain, she sang Adalgisa in Norma (Liverpool, 1841) and operatic roles at Covent Garden, as well as resuming her career as pantomime principal boy. The Sacred Harmonic Society engaged her for Messiah (Exeter Hall, 1843) alongside Elizabeth Rainforth, John Braham and Henry Phillips. Her career met with a setback when she broke a leg in a riding accident: the bone was set by the surgeon Samuel Bacon (c.1799-1856), who became her husband at St Pancras Church, on 10 July 1845. Soon after, she created the breeches role of Lazarillo in William Vincent Wallace's hugely successful opera Maritana (15 November 1845)."]}]}}
