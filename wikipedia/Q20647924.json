The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful clicktivism, with over 320,000 signatures. In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT, following a budget amendment by opposition Labour MP Paula Sherriff. It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods. On 3 October 2018, new EU VAT rules were put forward by the European Parliament which will allow EU countries to stop taxing sanitary products, but these will not come into effect until 2022. The UK left the EU in January 2020, and following the end of the transition period (at the beginning of 2021) the tampon tax was abolished in the UK, meaning there is now a zero rate of VAT applying to women's sanitary products."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2017 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Sherriff Paula\" | Paula Sherriff"]}, {"page": "List of Parliamentary constituencies in Yorkshire and the Humber", "response": ["|Paula Sherriff\u2021"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary votes on Brexit", "response": ["* Paula Sherriff, Dewsbury", "* Paula Sherriff, Dewsbury", "* Paula Sherriff, Dewsbury"]}, {"page": "Results of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum by constituency", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Paula Sherriff"]}]}}
