The museum opened to the public in 1977, initially housed in the old pilot's flight hut which was last occupied by the local Dumfries Gliding Club, giving the building a long history in aviation. The first complete airframes exhibited were a de Havilland Vampire T11 and a Gloster Meteor T7, acquired from the Royal Aircraft Establishment at West Freugh, an airfield 80 miles west of Dumfries. The opening ceremony was conducted by Micha\u0142 Cwynar DFC, a Polish fighter ace, who became the Museum's patron."]}]}}
