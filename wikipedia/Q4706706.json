This, and his well-known controversial views on private funding of universities, led to Richard Davis in 2002 dubbing him the \"doyen of economically rationalist vice-chancellors\".\n\nProfessor Gilbert died on 27 July 2010 in hospital in Manchester, having suffered from a serious illness for the last few months of his life.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Manchester", "response": ["The founding president and vice-chancellor of the new university was Alan Gilbert, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who retired at the end of the 2009\u20132010 academic year.

It was designed as a profit making venture, independent of as much government control as possible, in an attempt to maneuver around some of the limitations of legislation governing public universities. It was the brainchild of former Vice-Chancellor Alan Gilbert. It also allowed the public university to operate a management model and mission more akin to private market-driven universities in the USA (like the University of Phoenix). MUP's main potential markets were businesspeople and students of languages and international development, both in Australia and overseas.", "A new area of buildings was built immediately south of the main University of Melbourne campus, and one was earmarked for MUP. Controversially, this development involved the removal of old terrace houses and a lawn bowls club. However the upset was placated somewhat by the restoration of other buildings and the creation of a new public square. Despite the strong efforts of its parent, MUP's early life was less than successful, and it was downgraded to operating from the Hawthorn Language Centre in a Melbourne suburb. The multimillion-dollar building in which MUP maintained a small office was soon taken over by the public university, and named the \"Alan Gilbert Building\".", "MUP attracted the scrutiny of the Labor state government in 2001, but was subsequently re-accredited in 2003, with targets to increase research performance. However, its future dimmed when Alan Gilbert accepted a position at the University of Manchester in England in 2003. His successor, Glyn Davis, proved to be much more centrist, and was not fond of the private entity. John Cain, former Premier of Victoria, was one of MUP's most vocal critics, and his book Off Course pointed to shortcomings of MUP.", "On June 7, 2005, only months into his term, Glyn Davis announced that Melbourne University Private would close. Some of it, including the School of Enterprise, was merged with the University of Melbourne and continues to function, but the Hawthorn English Language Centre remained a separate entity. Other parts, including the international projects arm, were sold. The Chief Executive officer, David Lloyd, resigned at the time of the press announcement.

Historians such as \u00c9lie Hal\u00e9vy, Eric J. Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, and Alan Gilbert have explored the role of Methodism in the early decades of the making of the British working class (1760\u20131820). On the one hand it provided a model of how to efficiently organise large numbers of people and sustain their connection over a long period of time, and on the other it diverted and discouraged political radicalism. In explaining why Britain did not undergo a social revolution in the period 1790\u20131832, a time that appeared ripe for violent social upheaval, Hal\u00e9vy argued that Methodism forestalled revolution among the working class by redirecting its energies toward spiritual affairs rather than workplace concerns.

For example, the charter of the University of Manchester provides for the vice-chancellor to also use the title president, and the first vice-chancellor, Alan Gilbert (2004\u201310), used president as his main title. The University of Warwick now officially uses \"vice-chancellor and president\" (VCP), although the holder is usually still known as the vice-chancellor in all but official documents.
