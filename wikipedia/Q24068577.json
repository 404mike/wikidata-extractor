In September 2019, Keogh sustained a serious knee injury in a car crash after which two team-mates were charged with drink driving, so Davies regained both his starting place and the captaincy for the next match, against his former club Birmingham City."]}, {"page": "Gravesend Grammar School", "response": ["*Fikayo Tomori (born 1997), professional footballer, AC Milan and England"]}, {"page": "List of Chelsea F.C. players", "response": ["|  Fikayo Tomori", "|  Fikayo Tomori"]}, {"page": "Derby County F.C.", "response": ["* 2018\u201319  Fikayo Tomori"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Serie A players", "response": ["*Fikayo Tomori \u2013 Milan \u2013 2020\u2013"]}, {"page": "Richard Keogh", "response": ["During the 2018\u201319 campaign, Keogh captained the side for the majority of the season due to Curtis Davies' absence through injury.

Mateo Musacchio, L\u00e9o Duarte, and Andrea Conti departed during the winter transfer window (Duarte and Conti were loaned out, Musacchio was a permanent transfer).
