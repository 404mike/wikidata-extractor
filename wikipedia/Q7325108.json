The original source of the name Mynyddog is from Newydd Fynyddog, a hill near his home. Another submission is the name comes from Mynyddog Mwynfawr, a character in an early Welsh poem. Use of an adopted Welsh-language pseudonym or bardic name (ffug enw) is common among Welsh poets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Parry", "response": ["Parry's opera, Blodwen, was first performed in Aberystwyth's Temperance Hall on 21 May 1878, although Parry did not publish it until 1888, while at Swansea. This was the first opera written by a Welsh composer and also the first opera to be performed in Welsh. The opera, with its libretto written by Richard Davies, is set during the time of the Welsh Revolt\u2014the last attempt by the Welsh to preserve their independence.", "While Parry is most often thought of as the sole creator of the ballad, it was actually the work of three men.  At some point, Thomas Walter Price, a poet and journalist, published a poem in English called Arabella. It is believed that Parry wrote the music before the Welsh words of Myfanwy were written by Richard Davies. Parry's work was published in 1875, with Parry selling all rights to the song to a publisher for  \u00a312. The song was first performed at the first concert of the Aberystwyth and University Musical Society on 28 May 1875, with Parry as the conductor. It remains a standard in repertoires of Welsh male choirs today."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*Richard Davies (c. 1501\u20131581)", "*Richard Davies (Mynyddog) (1833\u20131877)"]}, {"page": "Llanbrynmair", "response": ["* Richard Davies (Mynyddog) (1833 \u2013 July 14, 1877), poet."]}, {"page": "Myfanwy", "response": ["Myfanwy (; a woman's name derived ) is a popular Welsh song, composed by Joseph Parry and first published in 1875.
