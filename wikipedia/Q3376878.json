One of the Haller letters (iii. 369) contains a statement of the fact that motor and sensory nerves are anatomically distinct, although they might coexist in the same bundle; the experimental proof came many years after. The ossicles of the ear serve the same purpose, he says, as the wooden rod inside a violin, 'ad continuandos tremores.' His 'Introduction to Physiology,\u2019 369 pages, 8vo, Lond. 1759, being the substance of his London lectures increased to twenty-eight, is full of the latest information well digested. He employed a person in the Norway trade to get for him a manuscript copy of a paper on the resuscitation of the drowned by a Copenhagen authority. His first work, dated from Hull in June 1738 and published at York in 1740, was 'Neuropathia,\u2019 a Latin poem in three books on hypochondriasis and hysteria, with a prose summary and additions prefixed, dedicated to Peter Shaw ('Doctissime Shavi!\u2019); it was republished at Rome, with an Italian translation by Moretti, in 1755. His next venture was 'A Proposal for the Improvement of Medicine, &c.,\u2019 being a collection of therapeutic essays on the use of bark in smallpox, on limes and other fruits and vegetables in scurvy, &c.; it was dedicated to Mead, who had been pleased with the 'Neuropathia.' In 1748 he published a new edition, much enlarged, and with remarks on Berkeley's tar water doctrine and on the bishop's use of the term \u2018panacea.\u2019 In 1751 he published in London 'The Nature of the Nervous Fluid, or Animal Spirits,\u2019 an attempt to adapt the latter doctrine to current nervous physiology. In the same year he published anonymously 'A new Critical Examination of an Important Passage in Mr. Locke's Essay on Human Understanding [on the possibility of thought being superadded to matter], in a familiar letter to a friend.' In 1753 he issued a physiological comment on Solano's prognostics from the pulse (dicrotism, intermittence, &c.), an account of which had been brought to England by Dr. Nihell, physician to the English factory at Madrid. In 1755 Flemyng published a paper in the 'Philosophical Transactions' on the imbibition of the liquor amnii by the f\u0153tus. Another paper, on corpulence, was read at the Royal Society in 1757, but not issued until the author printed it in 1760; it was translated into German by Joseph Jakob Plenk at Vienna in 1769, and reprinted in London as late as 1810. In 1754 he published at York 'A Proposal to diminish the Progress of the Distemper among the Horned Cattle' (2nd edition, Lond. 1755). His other writings are a 'Dissertation on James's Fever Powder' (Lond. 1760), and 'Adhesions or Accretions of the Lungs to the Pleura' (Lond. 1762), discussing the divergent views of Boerhaave and Haller as to the effects on the breathing. A disparaging criticism of this unimportant piece by a London reviewer caused him to issue the remainder of the impression with a 'Vindication' in 1763."]}, {"page": "Genevi\u00e8ve Thiroux d'Arconville", "response": ["In 1759, she translated Peter Shaw\u2019s Chemical Lectures, at the encouragement of Macquer.  Thiroux d'Arconville did not hesitate to fix any errors in Shaw's work and added information on the history of practical chemistry to the beginning of Shaw's text. In discussing the history of chemistry, she started with alchemy, which she claimed was not a true science. According to her, true chemistry began with men like Johann Joachim Becher, Herman Boerhaave, Georg Ernst Stahl, Nicolas Lemery and \u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois Geoffroy, men helped nature reveal to humanity. Thiroux d'Arconville drew from the Bible to discuss the history of chemistry in the preface; she took science related citations from the Bible and inserted science into biblical stories to defend her arguments. Thiroux d'Arconville's usage of the Bible in her discussion on the history of chemistry was common for scholars of this time period; science was seen as a way to better understand God's creations.", "* Le\u00e7ons de chimie, 1759, in-4.
