They released an EP called Commit No Nuisance, which featured the tracks \"Perfect Pygmalion\", \"Look Inside\", \"Torch Song\", \"Honesty Box\" and \"Fake\". In 2003, with the addition of guitarist Rory Clewlow, Hybryd became Enter Shikari. The band was named after Shikari, a boat belonging to vocalist Rou Reynolds' uncle. \"Shikari is a Hindi word for hunter.\" After the band's lineup and name change, Reynolds focused his musical efforts on vocals and electronics instead of guitar.", "A 2-disc version of Common Dreads was released in January 2010. Frontman Rou Reynolds announced that \"we\u2019ve got a different artist for each single from Hospital Records to do drum 'n' bass remixes so we'll be releasing that as a 12\". Then we're doing the same thing with (dubstep label) True Tiger who've done a dubstep remix of each single.\" However it was later said in a Radio 1 interview that in fact they were only having their main singles remixed.", "In Summer 2012's Kerrang! Awards, the band scooped 'Best Live Band' for the second time, along with Rou Reynolds winning 'Hero of the Year.' They were also nominated for best album, but lost out to Mastodon.", "In 2018 the band embarked on an extensive tour of the UK, Europe, and Scandinavia, entitled \"Stop the Clocks\", during which they performed a new song of the same name. The band released the song as a single on 12 August 2019 shortly before their performances at the 2019 Reading and Leeds Festivals where they played 5 different sets across the weekend. Following this, the band resumed their Stop the Clocks tour with a twelve-date American leg, which singer Rou Reynolds said would \"bring the whole 'Spark-era' full circle.\"", "Enter Shikari's lyrics, written by frontman Rou Reynolds, are often politically charged. In a 2015 interview, Kerrang! Magazine wrote: \"With Shikari a rare, political voice on the UK rock scene, Rou remains baffled by bands 'labelling themselves as punk that aren't speaking about anything of importance'. 'To us it's second nature,' he says. 'It's what this music is for. If you take out the social commentary, it's not punk, it's just noisy pop.'\" At the same time, Reynolds \"[doesn't] care if people don't read the lyrics\" and only \"appreciate Shikari as a noisy pop group\". Although not all of the band's lyrics are political, \"even when [Enter Shikari write] a love song, [Reynolds wants] to make sure [they] reclaim the love song from all the shit, vapid love songs on the charts.\" He also stated that the band's general message is that \"if we base our lives around love and unity, then that's all that matters.\"", "Enter Shikari's lyrics have also centred around more personal themes throughout their career, such as lead singer Rou Reynolds' anxiety, depression, mental illness, self-pity and the loss of a loved one or idolised celebrity figure. Their album The Spark in particular delves more into personal issues within the band, with Reynolds stating in an interview with The Independent, regarding lyrical themes: \"What I was trying to do with this album in marrying the personal and the political is to ensure that human vulnerability is laid bare, and to not be afraid to speak about emotions.\" He elaborates by stating that \"I don\u2019t think I could have done it [writing more personal lyrics] before this record. So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable. I have a very finely attuned cringe muscle, I don\u2019t like writing about things that have been written about a thousand times. Some of it is maybe even a self-confidence thing, feeling as though I don\u2019t have much to offer in terms of art that helps other people. But seeing as 2015 was the year of hell for me, it wasn\u2019t just that I wanted to write a more personal record, I had to. There was no way of not doing it\".", "Rou Reynolds has cited British pop music from the 20th century as being a major influence on his songwriting, particularly on their album The Spark, with The Beatles, The Damned, Joy Division and New Order being key influences on him.", "In 2017, Rou Reynolds released a book named Dear Future Historians, a song-by-song lyrical analysis of the band's work including photos.

The song \"Fanfare for the Conscious Man\" contains lyrical connotations to the injustice of the various wars the government were engaging in whilst Enter Shikari were writing the album, the line, \"Our gracious queen should grasp her crown, and take a good fucking swing at Blair and Brown\" confirms the anti-war views of this song. The band expresses further political ideas in the song \"Juggernauts\" where the closing line is; \"The idea of community will be something displayed in a museum\", when coupled with the anti-capitalist and hopeless tone of previous lyrics, can be interpreted as a Pro-Collectivist stance.
