This time, Smith's trial was successful and Bradford City \u2013 still a Third Division North side \u2013 signed him on amateur forms. Smith had played only seven games for the reserves in the Midland League and was still unpaid when he was given his first-team debut against Scunthorpe United on 17 January 1953 coming into the side for Brendan McManus, whom Smith said was \"having a rough time\". It was not a good start for Smith, with City losing 4\u20130, but he followed this with a clean sheet in his second game against Stockport County and kept his place in the side for the remainder of the season, playing 19 games, before he signed part-time professional terms in July 1953. He had previously worked part-time as a lorry driver, earning \u00a34 10s (\u00a34.50) working 48 hours per week as a lorry driver, but the club did not want him driving around the country and offered him \u00a310 per week plus a \u00a34 win bonus. To supplement his playing contract, the club gave Smith a job looking after their Valley Parade ground."]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Brendan McManus||||GK||1||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Brendan McManus||||1945\u20131947||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}]}}
