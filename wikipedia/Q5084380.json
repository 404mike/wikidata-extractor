White fought from 1906 until 1923.  He made one ill-fated comeback attempt in 1930, but was ignominiously TKOed by Henry Perlick, a nondescript fighter who would not have stood a chance against White in his prime.  White boxed in the United States for his entire career making his home in Chicago at the age of seven. Under current rules, his championship bouts with Willie Ritchie and Freddie Welsh, where he dealt more blows would have had him winning the bouts on points and taking the world lightweight championship, but when he fought only a knockout would have allowed him to win the match and the title.  In 1958, Nat Fleischer, publisher of The Ring magazine rated Charley White the tenth greatest lightweight of all time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Knockout", "response": ["* Charley White 57"]}, {"page": "Abe Attell", "response": ["|align=left| Charley White", "|align=left| Charley White", "|align=left| Charley White", "|align=left| Charley White"]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Charley White (Charles Anchowitz), lightweight boxer from 1906 until 1923"]}, {"page": "Freddie Welsh", "response": ["In the spring of 1914, Welsh contacted Ritchie and asked him if he would face him in England, providing he got a satisfactory guarantee of money.Gallimore (2006), p. 200 Ritchie agreed that he would fight for the right money. Welsh cabled the Olympia Theatre, London and began booking advertising space.Gallimore (2006), p. 201 When Ritchie finally stated that he wanted $50,000, win lose or draw, Welsh said the price \"would make a horse laugh\", and was double what he was expecting. Despite this huge fee, England was desperate for a world champion and $40,000 was raised on the stipulation that Ritchie fought no other bouts in the meantime.Gallimore (2006), p. 202 Ritchie accepted the $40,000 but stated a fight was already planned and he would fight who he liked. The London syndicate relented to his demands. Before Ritchie's arranged fight with Charley White, Welsh took in two more encounters, beating Leach Cross on points and then Joe Mandot on press decision. All attention then switched to the White-Ritchie fight in Milwaukee.Gallimore (2006), p. 203 In almost the first punch that White connected with, Ritchie was in trouble. Staggered, Ritchie was laid open to a battering, but stayed on his feet until the end of the fight. White was declared winner, but as he had failed to stop Ritchie before the end of the match, he kept his world title. Pollok and Welsh then took a major gamble. They sent a telegram to Ritchie with the message, 'Promoters have called off match with you. Want us to meet White.', a bluff to force the Champion's hand. The following day Ritchie accepted a fee for $25,000 and $1,500 expenses to meet Welsh in London. The White fight had cost Ritchie almost $15,000.", "A week later Welsh faced Charley White, the man most sports-writers believed was the natural contender for the lightweight title.

The fight was a careful battle of boxing strategy, but White always held the potential for stronger punching with his left hook.  Leonard may have won largely due to his faster reaction time, and reflexes, against an opponent who was nearly his equal at times. He showed better speed and agility, and used footwork to gain advantages in the angle of his attack.  The hard punching White knocked Leonard out of the ring in the fifth round with his left hook, but by the ninth, White was down five times, finally landing on the canvas for the count from a right cross from Leonard.  Benny had been looking for an opening since the eighth, and found it after he opened White up with his left jab, and dealt the final right cross in the ninth. Though he had continued to train, Leonard may have performed better if he had not just taken five months off from prizefighting while living in Hollywood.
