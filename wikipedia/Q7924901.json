Goalkeeper Tom Fern was one of the injured, and so 44-year-old Howard Matthews was re-signed, having left the club nineteen years earlier.

They beat Bristol City 5\u20130 on the final day of the season, but still finished 21st, two points behind Bristol City, and were thus relegated. Vic Rouse, Alf Bennett, and David Rollo were let go.
