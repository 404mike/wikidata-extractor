He had a run in the league side in his first season, but lost his place to Des Tennant, and moved on to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic in January 1958. His performances for Bournemouth earned him a move to Portsmouth of the Second Division, but he played only 30 matches over two seasons, the second of which ended in relegation to the third tier and Thomas was released. His last league club was Aldershot of the Fourth Division, where he made 103 league appearances over three seasons. He then played for Southern League club Hereford United."]}]}}
