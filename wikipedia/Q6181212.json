Catto was a Brackenbury Scholar in History at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated with first-class honours. He held a master's degree (M.A.) and a doctorate (D.Phil.) From 1964 to 1969 he was employed as a tutor at Hatfield College, Durham. During this time he became acquainted with Mark Lancaster and Bryan Ferry, who were then art students in nearby Newcastle.His research interests lay in the politics and religion of later medieval England. In a piece in The Spectator to commemorate his retirement in June 2006, Alan Duncan MP described him as \"the quintessential Oxford don ... if one were to devour C. P. Snow, Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Porterhouse Blue, there is a smattering of Catto in each.\"He died on 17 August 2018 at the age of 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oriel College, Oxford", "response": ["On 24 April 1324,Christopher and Edward Hibbert's The Encyclopedia of Oxford at p. 291 gives the date as April 24, with the wording \"Adam de Brome, obtained from King Edward II, licence\".

Rannie's Oriel College at p. 4 has \"On April 28, 1324, Letters Patent issued by the King giving licence\" the Rector of the University Church, Adam de Brome, obtained a licence from King Edward II to found a \"certain college of scholars studying various disciplines in honour of the Virgin\" and to endow it to the value of \u00a330 a year.Hibbert, Christopher, The Encyclopedia of Oxford London: Macmillan (1988) pp. 291\u2013295.

J.A.F. Thomson has suggested that, actually, the chronicler was a churchman, due among other things to the quantity of Latin aphorisms the later text contains, compared with the pre-1467 section; either way, Thomson agrees that whoever it was, must have been a man with \"London connections and a pride in the city.\" One of the most recent biographers Gregory has noted how, in fact, \"a single reference, to a papal indulgence issued in 1455, associates Gregory personally with [this] chronicle... but the extent of his authorship is uncertain.\" For instance Michael Hicks goes no further than to suggest tentatively that, of all the London chroniclers, \u201cat least one was a mayor,\u201d whilst Jeremy Catto believes that \"we can identify no particular individual writer.\u201c Mary-Rose McLaren summed up the problem facing historians wishing to establish the authorship of the Edgerton MS when she pointed out that, comparing Gregory's chronicle with others of the period, there is more than one mayor named in it, and that in any case, it is not the only one to name Gregory as the mayor of London during that time.McLaren pp. 29\u201331 + n. 47"]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Jeremy Catto, 79, British historian."]}, {"page": "2018 in literature", "response": ["*August 17 \u2013 Jeremy Catto, English historian, 79 (born 1939)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2018", "response": ["*Jeremy Catto, 79, English historian.Dr Jeremy Catto 1939-2018"]}, {"page": "Bitter-Sweet (Bryan Ferry album)", "response": ["As shown in the album credits, Ferry dedicated Bitter-Sweet to his friend Jeremy Catto."]}]}}
