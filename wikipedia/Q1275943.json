He was also an amateur physiologist. American feminist Margaret Fuller  called Lewes a \"witty, French, flippant sort of man\". He became part of the mid-Victorian ferment of ideas which encouraged discussion of Darwinism, positivism, and religious skepticism. However, he is perhaps best known today for having openly lived with Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pen name George Eliot, as soulmates whose lives and writings were enriched by their relationship, though they never married each other.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
