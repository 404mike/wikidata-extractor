She was also known as Mrs Reeves after her marriage in 1877 to Dr. Henry Albert Reeves (1841\u20131914) but was best known under her pen name, Helen Mathers. She was born in Misterton, Somerset. Her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" was published in 1875. It was partly based on people in her life and on her own early romantic experiences. She also acknowledged Rhoda Broughton as an early influence. She continued to write until her death.\nShe was educated at a boarding school in  Chantry near Frome in Somerset. In her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" she describes some of her experiences at school. \"Mr Russell\" in the novel was the Rev. Mr. Fussell in real life, who was the Lord of the manor and founder of the school. In the novel she calls the village Charteris. From 1875 to 1895 the novel sold over 35,000 copies.Due to a confusion of titles, some sources attribute a number of books by Scottish novelist Anne S. Swan to Mathers. Mathers published a short novel entitled \"Land o' the Leal, by the Author of Comin' Thro' the Rye\" in 1878. Swan published \"The Land o' the Leal\" (same title except with the addition of \"The,\" completely different book) using her male pseudonym David Lyall, in 1896. Conflating the two different novels with the same title has led some people to assume (erroneously) that David Lyall is Mathers's pseudonym. It is not.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1878 in literature", "response": ["*Ellen Buckingham Mathews (pseudonym Helen Mathers) \u2013 Cherry Ripe"]}, {"page": "Whatley, Mendip", "response": ["*Ellen Buckingham Mathews, novelist"]}, {"page": "Mathers", "response": ["* \"Helen Mathers\", pen-name of English author Ellen Buckingham Mathews (1853\u20131920)"]}, {"page": "Misterton, Somerset", "response": ["* Ellen Buckingham Mathews (1853 - 1920) an English novelist under the pen name Helen Mathers was born in the village."]}, {"page": "Helen Mathers", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ellen Buckingham Mathews"]}, {"page": "Henry Reeves (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Ellen Buckingham Mathews (1853\u20131920), writer also known as Mrs. Henry Reeves"]}, {"page": "Cherry Ripe (novel)", "response": ["Cherry Ripe is a romance novel by the British writer Ellen Buckingham Mathews under her pen name of Helen Matthews, which was first published in 1878.
