Joshua Smith was an incessant writer.  In 1839 he gained a diploma of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Copenhagen for his work The Discovery of America by the Northmen in the Tenth Century, while his interest in geology and subsequent papers led to him being offered the position of President of the newly formed Geologists' Association, but other than delivering the inaugural speech, he did very little.  However, the main focus of his writings for many years was as a proponent of local self-government through traditional institutions, such as the parish, the vestry and the ward, a subject also taken up by his daughter Lucy Toulmin Smith.  After the cholera epidemic of 1847, Smith's knowledge of law combined with his involvement in his own Highgate neighbourhood led to his demanding better sanitation and reforms advocating devolution and local responsibility.  In 1851 his work Local Self-Government and Centralisation was published and followed in 1854 by The Parish and its Obligations and Powers.", "Lucy Toulmin Smith"]}, {"page": "Toulmin Smith", "response": ["*Lucy Toulmin Smith (1838\u20131911), American-born editor and librarian, daughter of Joshua"]}, {"page": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des anciens textes fran\u00e7ais", "response": ["| Lucy Toulmin Smith and Paul Meyer"]}, {"page": "The Brome play of Abraham and Isaac", "response": ["The play is often considered the best of Middle English Abraham plays, humane in its treatment of infanticide, inventive in its language; Lucy Toulmin Smith, a nineteenth-century editor, found it to be superior to others of the period on the same subject and in the twentieth century George K.
