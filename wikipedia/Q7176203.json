Making his YouTube debut in August 2006 with Telling it all, a series of five-to-ten minute autobiographical videos, Oakley gained popularity with a wide section of the YouTube community. Amongst the autobiographical details revealed in his videos are that he served as a radar mechanic during World War II, that he had a lifelong love of motorcycles, and that he lived alone as a widower and pensioner.\nHis unforeseen rise was widely reported by international media outlets and online news sources and blogs. After resisting all media attention for a long time (including requests for interviews, photographs, and attempts to identify him), insisting that he only wished to converse with the YouTube community in an informal and personal way, Oakley finally gave his first interview, for the BBC's The Money Programme, which was aired on BBC Two on 16 February 2007.\nBy mid-2006, Oakley was the most subscribed user on YouTube. His rise to the #1 position took place in just over a week. In the process, he displaced users who had been around since the site's launch, including NBC-signed Brooke Brodack. In November that year, he had 30,000 subscribers. Oakley also holds the record for being the first user on YouTube to reach the milestone of 25,000 subscribers. He uploaded 434 videos between 2006 and 2014 covering several topics from childhood memories to setting up a Google account. He also set up a second channel dedicated to music, Geriatric1927Blues, in 2009.Oakley was later diagnosed with cancer which was too far advanced for treatment. He posted his final video on 12 February 2014 and died a month later on the morning of 23 March 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Money Programme", "response": ["* Peter Oakley"]}, {"page": "St. Mary's High School (Annapolis, Maryland)", "response": ["*Peter Oakley, Senator from Maryland "]}, {"page": "Geriatric 1927", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Oakley"]}, {"page": "The Zimmers", "response": ["*Peter Oakley (died aged 86, on 23 March 2014)"]}, {"page": "List of YouTubers", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"| \u2020 Peter Oakley"]}, {"page": "Oakley (surname)", "response": ["*Peter Oakley (1927\u20132014), Internet celebrity"]}, {"page": "Geriatric1927", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Oakley"]}, {"page": "City of Norwich School", "response": ["* Peter Oakley, pensioner from Bakewell, Derbyshire, England; better known by his pseudonym geriatric1927 on YouTube"]}, {"page": "August 20", "response": ["*  1927   \u2013 Peter Oakley, English soldier and blogger (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "Chartjackers", "response": ["Over the course of the series, several figures from both the music and entertainment industry made an appearance on Chartjackers, usually to offer advice or encouragement to the four boys. The first celebrity to feature on the show was former pop star Chesney Hawkes, who remarked that he felt that the team had \"every experience between [them] to actually pull [their aim of reaching number one] off\". During the fourth episode, vocal coaches David and Carrie Grant offered advice to the group on what criteria to use when judging the submitted video auditions, and indie rock band The Young Knives sent in a video message, wishing the team success. The following episode, Charlie Simpson of Fightstar explained to the boys the differences between releasing music through major and independent labels. During episode six, the team met with Peter Oakley, who spoke about his own chart success as part of The Zimmers, and Hardy, who advised ways in which the music video could be filmed. The next episode, the group received advice from celebrity stylist Hannah Sandling, who suggested how Chartrand and Nichols should be styled for the video, and entertainment journalist Rav Singh, who discussed how to get airplay for \"I've Got Nothing\" through publicity stunts."]}, {"page": "I've Got Nothing", "response": ["Many viewers submitted clips that were literal interpretations of the lyrics. For example, some viewers held up medals and trophies for the lyric \"won the greatest prize\", others zoomed-in on their own eye during the line \"look into my eyes\" and others turned off lights for the lyric \"the lights are going out\". Most of the shots of Chartrand and Nichols are of them singing \"I've Got Nothing\" in a park with an actor dressed as Pudsey Bear, but the video also features shots of them eating ice cream, swinging around a lamp post and dancing in front of a tree. The video begins with shots of the duo throwing a football back and forth to each other. At 2:03, the video splits into 35 equally sized smaller rectangles, each containing a clip of a \"ChartJackersProject\" viewer clapping in time with \"I've Got Nothing\". Over the next 18 seconds of the song, 11 different sets of 35 viewers (i.e. approximately 385 viewers in total) are shown clapping along with the song.
