Both sides were initially involved in an armed campaign against the British state, but the Officials gradually moved into mainstream politics after the Official IRA ceasefire of 1972; the associated \"Official Sinn F\u00e9in\" eventually renamed itself the Workers' Party. The Provisional IRA, except during brief ceasefires in 1972 and 1975, kept up a campaign of violence for nearly thirty years, directed against security forces and civilian targets (especially businesses). While the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) represented the nationalists of Northern Ireland in initiatives such as the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement, republicans took no part in these, believing that a withdrawal of British troops and a commitment to a united Ireland was a necessary precondition of any settlement. This began to change with a landmark speech by Danny Morrison in 1981, advocating what became known as the Armalite and ballot box strategy. Under the leadership of Gerry Adams, Sinn F\u00e9in began to focus on the search for a political settlement. When the party voted in 1986 to take seats in legislative bodies within Ireland, there was a walk-out of die-hard republicans, who set up Republican Sinn F\u00e9in and the Continuity IRA. Following the Hume\u2013Adams dialogue, Sinn F\u00e9in took part in the Northern Ireland peace process which led to the IRA ceasefires of 1994 and 1997 and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. After elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, republicans sat in government in Northern Ireland for the first time when Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Br\u00fan were elected to the Northern Ireland Executive. However, another split occurred, with anti-Agreement republicans setting up the 32 County Sovereignty Movement and the Real IRA. Today, Irish republicanism is divided between those who support the institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement and the later St Andrews Agreement, and those who oppose them. The latter are often referred to as dissident republicans."]}, {"page": "Barbara Brown", "response": ["*Bairbre de Br\u00fan, Irish politician"]}, {"page": "1954 in Ireland", "response": ["*10 January \u2013 Bairbre de Br\u00fan, Sinn F\u00e9in MEP and first Sinn F\u00e9in politician to represent Northern Ireland in the European Parliament."]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=3|Bairbre de Br\u00fan"]}, {"page": "Tyrone County Hospital", "response": ["In June 2002 the then Health Minister Bairbre de Br\u00fan announced the closure of the hospital, a decision which was confirmed by the new Health Minister Michael McGimpsey in January 2009.
