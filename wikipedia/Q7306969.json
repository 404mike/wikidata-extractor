When he was 12 years old he left school and worked in a tin mill and coal mine. He later went to the USA for better financial benefits where he met a Jewish Christian named Maurice Solomon who was following the Messiah. Howells also read a book of Professor Henry Drummond. Both influences caused him to become an Evangelical Christian. Later he returned to Wales.  He was affected by the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival.\nHe and his wife were later missionaries in Africa. He was led down the path of intercession for many years, before seeing Revival across Southern Africa from 1915-1920.  The rise of Adolf Hitler and the outbreak of World War II also marked a period of strong activity in Howells' ministry of intercession.\nThey had only one child, a son, named Samuel Rees Howells, who later became the Director of the Bible College of Wales.\nIn 1924 he founded the Bible College of Wales in Swansea, Wales. After a long period of closure the College has now been purchased, refurbished and reopened by Cornerstone church based in Singapore.", "link_mentions": {}}}
