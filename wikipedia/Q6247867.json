Primarily a centre forward, he could also play as an inside forward and was occasionally used at left-half. Born in Darlington, County Durham, he began his career in non-League football with Northern Football League side Darlington Railway Athletic. He later had a spell with Cockfield before joining Football League Third Division South club Charlton Athletic in August 1925. In his first season with the London club he made six league appearances as the team finished 21st in the division and were forced to apply for re-election.\nMcGuire moved to the Third Division North in November 1926 when he signed for Wigan Borough. In what was to be the most prolific goalscoring period of his career, he netted 13 goals in 33 league matches for the Springfield Park club in a 13-month spell. Four months into the 1927\u201328 season, McGuire transferred to struggling Nelson on a free transfer. He made his debut for Nelson in the 1\u20135 defeat to Ashington at Seedhill on 3 December 1927. The following game, he scored his first goal for his new side in the 2\u20134 away loss at his former club Wigan Borough. McGuire went on to make a total of 20 league appearances for Nelson, but scored only once more. The team finished bottom of the Third Division North at the end of the campaign, and while their re-election application was successful several players, including McGuire, left the club in the summer of 1928.\nIn July 1928, McGuire signed for his hometown club, Darlington. He spent two seasons at Feethams, during which time he played 42 league matches and scored 7 goals before retiring from professional football at the end of the 1929\u201330 campaign.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McGuire", "response": ["John McGuire is the name of:", "*John McGuire (actor) (1910\u20131980), American actor", "*John McGuire (businessman), Irish businessman and television presenter", "*John McGuire (composer) (born 1942), American composer", "*John McGuire (Virginia politician) (born 1968), Virginia House of Delegates", "*John McGuire (footballer) (1902\u2013?), English footballer", "*John McGuire (sportsman) (born 1954), Australian rules football player and cricketer"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|John McGuire"]}]}}
