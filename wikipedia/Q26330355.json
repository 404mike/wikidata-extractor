Ribeiro planned to strengthen his team further though, and was hopeful of signing another goalkeeper, striker, winger and left back. He achieved one of his targets by bringing in young Birmingham City striker Alex Jones on loan until January. Ribeiro went on to achieve his first win as Vale manager with a 2\u20130 victory over a poor Southend United side on 13 August. Despite only joining the club six weeks ago, Carlos Saleiro agreed to have his contract cancelled by mutual consent as he \"found it difficult to adjust to life in the country\". The good results kept coming though, and impressive young defender Nathan Smith scored a headed goal as Vale extending their run of league clean sheets to three games with a 1\u20130 win over Rochdale. In a bizarre revelation, The Sun newspaper reported that Mario Balotelli could join the Vale on loan; the story was ridiculed by local journalists and fans on social media. Vale conceded their first league goal in a 1\u20130 defeat at Swindon Town on 20 August, despite Ribeiro's view that Vale were the better side on the day. Northampton Town boss Rob Page was allowed to sign JJ Hooper on a five-month loan deal starting from 22 August, after the striker began the season on the right-wing for Vale. Later that night a grenade was found at Vale Park, which was later determined to be a training device from World War II. With Kiko and Yates both injured, Ribeiro signed Liverpool Academy left-back Sam Hart on a season-long loan. He also signed 29-year old former Northern Ireland striker Martin Paterson, who had been a free agent after leaving Blackpool. Vale continued their excellent start to the campaign by beating Scunthorpe United 3\u20131; substitutes Paterson, Hart and Amoros all made their first appearances for the club in the game, with the latter two players making their first appearances in professional football.

Visitors Gillingham led 1\u20130 at Vale Park on 17 September, before Vale turned round the game completely to achieve a 2\u20131 victory; manager Justin Edinburgh told the media that he believed the crowd had influenced the referee, to which Jerome Thomas responded on social media by displaying his bruised and bloodied shin. Vale then found themselves in the reverse situation at the Memorial Stadium, going from a 1\u20130 lead to an ultimate 2\u20131 defeat after Bristol Rovers equalised on 43 minutes.

A Remie Streete header seemed to have handed Vale a comfortable win at Gillingham, but a Josh Parker header five minutes into injury time levelled the game at 1\u20131. Streete then fractured his leg in a 2\u20130 defeat at Millwall, as Vale dropped to just one place above the relegation zone. A 1\u20131 home draw with Bristol Rovers then allowed Bury to overtake Vale to leave Vale in the relegation zone for the first time in the season; the injury also crisis worsened as Walker left the pitch with a serious knee injury. Bradford City then came to Burslem to claim three points, with Alex Jones scoring his first goal in Bradford colours to make the final score 2\u20131.
