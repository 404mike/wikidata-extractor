He was also closely associated with the Liverpool Philharmonic and Hall\u00e9 orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of Britain and, according to the BBC, was Britain's first international conductor.", "Beecham was born in St Helens, Lancashire (now Merseyside), in a house adjoining the Beecham's Pills laxative factory founded by his grandfather, Thomas Beecham.Reid, p. 19 His parents were Joseph Beecham, the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, n\u00e9e Burnett. In 1885, with the family firm flourishing financially, Joseph Beecham moved his family to a large house in Ewanville, Huyton, near Liverpool. Their former home was demolished to make room for an extension to the pill factory.Lucas, p. 6", "Beecham and his brother Henry had to sell enough of their father's estate to discharge this mortgage. For more than three years, Beecham was absent from the musical scene, working to sell property worth over \u00a31\u00a0million.  By 1923 enough money had been raised. The mortgage was discharged, and Beecham's personal liabilities, amounting to \u00a341,558, were paid in full.\"Sir Thomas Beecham to Pay in Full: The Receiving Order Discharged\", The Manchester Guardian, 29 March 1923, p. 10 In 1924 the Covent Garden property and the pill-making business at St Helens were united in one company, Beecham Estates and Pills. The nominal capital was \u00a31,850,000, of which Beecham had a substantial share.", "After his absence, Beecham first reappeared on the rostrum conducting the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester in March 1923, in a programme including works by Berlioz, Bizet, Delius and Mozart.Langford, Samuel. \"The Hall\u00e9 Concerts: Sir Thomas Beecham's Return\", The Manchester Guardian, 16 March 1923, p.18  He returned to London the following month, conducting the combined Royal Albert Hall Orchestra (the renamed New Symphony Orchestra) and London Symphony Orchestra in April 1923. The main work on the programme was Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben.\"Albert Hall Concert: Sir Thomas Beecham's Return\", The Times, 9 April 1923, p. 10  No longer with an orchestra of his own, Beecham established a relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra that lasted for the rest of the 1920s. Towards the end of the decade, he negotiated inconclusively with the BBC over the possibility of establishing a permanent radio orchestra.Kennedy (1971), p. 138", "Beecham's attitude towards 19th-century German repertoire was equivocal. He frequently disparaged Beethoven, Wagner and others, but regularly conducted their works, often with great success.Cardus, p. 60 He observed, \"Wagner, though a tremendous genius, gorged music like a German who overeats. And Bruckner was a hobbledehoy who had no style at all\u00a0... Even Beethoven thumped the tub; the Ninth symphony was composed by a kind of Mr. Gladstone of music.\" Despite his criticisms, Beecham conducted all the Beethoven symphonies during his career, and he made studio recordings of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, and live recordings of No. 9 and Missa Solemnis.Jenkins (1988), p. 3; and \"Search results: Beethoven/Thomas Beecham\", WorldCat.

Along with Sir Colin Davis, Beecham has been described as one of the two \"foremost modern interpreters\" of Berlioz's music.Lebrecht, Norman. \"Hector Berlioz\u00a0\u2013 the Unloved Genius\", The Lebrecht Weekly (La Scena Musicale), 10 December 2003.
