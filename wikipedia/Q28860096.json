While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Middlesex at Lord's in 1877. One of five Old Cliftonians to feature in the Oxford side that year, Stubbs batted once in the match and was dismissed for a single run in the Oxford first-innings by Alfred Stratford. With his right-arm roundarm fast bowling, he took the wicket of Augustus Nepean in the Middlesex first-innings, and followed this up by taking the wickets of Nepean and Stratford in their second-innings, to finish with match figures of 3 for 41.
