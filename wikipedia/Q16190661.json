Her case was debated in the House of Commons and was covered in newspapers internationally including The Chicago Defender. The decision would eventually be reversed.  \nKing was born in Limehouse in London's East End in 1917. Her father, Henry King, born in Georgetown, British Guiana, worked as a firefighter in the Merchant Navy, and her brother Fitzherbert King served in the Royal Navy. She worked as a fancy box maker before World War II and volunteered to join the Women's Land Army in September 1943.\n\nKing was refused entry to the Land Army by its Essex County branch committee because it was believed it would be difficult to place her, as there would be objections due to her ethnicity. With support from the Holborn Trades Council, King presented the issue to her local representative, Walter Edwards MP, who raised the issue of racism within the Land Army at the House of Commons. This, along with another racially-motivated incident that occurred within the same week in which cricketer Learie Constantine was denied accommodation at a London hotel, attracted widespread controversy and criticism and brought the 'Colour Bar' into focus.In an interview with George Padmore, published in The Chicago Defender, King reflected \"I said to them, if I'm not good enough to work on the land, then I am not good enough to make munitions. No one has ever suggested that my father and brother were not good enough to fight for the freedom of England.\"The refusal was reversed and King was able to formally join the Women's Land Army in October 1943. She worked at Frith Farm in Fareham, Hampshire until 1944.King died at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel in 1995, aged 78.", "link_mentions": []}}
