It was once declared \"one of the most recognisable voices in rock\". He was also noted for his unique way of singing, which was once described as \"looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\". He was also known for his bass playing style and using his Rickenbacker bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\".Another notable aspect of his bass sound was that he often played power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall.\nHe was also known for a large facial 'skin tag' which he chose not to remove. It epitomized his joie de vivre and seeming imperviousness to the vanity or the criticism and/or critique of others.\nLemmy was born in Stoke-on-Trent and grew up between there, the nearby towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Madeley, and later the Welsh village of Benllech. He was influenced by rock and roll and the early works of the Beatles, which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s, such as the Rockin' Vickers. He worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and The Nice before joining the space rock band Hawkwind in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit \"Silver Machine\". In 1975, he was fired from Hawkwind after an arrest for drug possession. That same year, he founded Mot\u00f6rhead. The band's success peaked around 1980 and 1981, including the hit single \"Ace of Spades\" and the chart-topping live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.\nLemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Mot\u00f6rhead until his death on 28 December 2015 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1990. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer two days before his death. Alongside his music career, he had minor roles and cameos in film and television. He was known for his hard-living lifestyle, which included chain-smoking and daily consumption of large amounts of alcohol and amphetamine.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mot\u00f6rhead", "response": ["Despite his ongoing health issues forcing Mot\u00f6rhead to cut short or cancel several US shows, Lemmy Kilmister was able to bounce back in time for the trio's annual Mot\u00f6rboat heavy metal cruise from Miami to the Bahamas which ran from 28 September through 2 October 2015 including performances by bands such as Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Suicidal Tendencies and Corrosion of Conformity.

Players of the six-string include John Lennon of the Beatles, John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Paul Weller of the Jam, John Kay of Steppenwolf, Peter Buck of R.E.M., Johnny Marr of the Smiths, and Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles. Players who have used Rickenbacker basses include Paul McCartney of the Beatles, Lemmy Kilmister of Mot\u00f6rhead, Cliff Burton of Metallica, Roger Glover and Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple, Paul Wilson of Snow Patrol, Bruce Foxton of the Jam, Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers, Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy, Chris Squire of Yes, Geddy Lee of Rush, Al Cisneros of Sleep and Om, Paul D'Amour of Tool, and Rick James and Kevin Parker of Tame Impala, Dave Strait Slow Death", "In the hard rock vein, Deep Purple's Roger Glover was a prominent Rickenbacker aficionado. Geddy Lee of Rush used a Rickenbacker on the band's earlier material. Another enthusiast was Metallica bassist Cliff Burton, whose heavily modified 4001, red with white hardware and trim, debuted during the group's Kill 'Em All era. Also noteworthy was Mot\u00f6rhead vocalist/bassist Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister, for whom Rickenbacker produced a 60-bass run of \"Lemmy Kilmister\" signature basses: the 4004LK, fitted with three pickups, gold hardware, and elaborate wood carving in the shape of oak leaves. In 2019, the company produced a 420-bass run of Al Cisneros signature basses honoring the prominent Sleep and Om bassist, a long-time Rickenbacker proponent. Cisneros's 4003AC model features a signature pickguard, green inlays on the fingerboard, and a removable thumb rest."]}, {"page": "Emerson, Lake & Palmer", "response": ["From November 1973 to September 1974, the band toured North America and Europe which included a headline spot at the inaugural California Jam Festival on 6 April 1974 at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California, to an attendance of 250,000 people. Their performance was broadcast across the US. The band's live shows exhibited an unorthodox mix of virtuoso musicianship and over-the-top performances which received much criticism. Their theatrics included Emerson playing a piano as it spun, suspended, end-over-end; Palmer playing on a rotating drum platform; and a Hammond organ thrown around the stage to create feedback. Emerson often used a knife, given to him by Lemmy Kilmister who had roadied for the Nice,\"According to Keith Emerson as written in his autobiography, two of Lemmy's Hitlerjugend knives were gifted to Keith Emerson himself during Lemmy's time spent as a roadie for The Nice. Emerson used these knives many times as \"keyholders\" during his famous wrestling sessions with the Hammond Organ during the shows with The Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.\" to force the keys on the organ to stay down. Emerson used a large Moog modular synthesizer on stage but it was unreliable as heat affected its sound.\"Bob Moog told Keith that it would never work live and that he was out of his mind for trying to take it out on the road.\" The band carried almost 40 tons of equipment for the tour. ELP were one of the top world concert draws during 1973-74. Performances from the band's 1973\u201374 tour were documented in the live album, Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen, released in August 1974 as a triple LP. The album peaked at No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in the US."]}, {"page": "No More Tears", "response": ["Guitarist Zakk Wylde contributed songwriting to the album, while Mot\u00f6rhead bassist/vocalist Lemmy Kilmister wrote the lyrics for six songs; however, only four were used on the album. Although Mike Inez appeared in the album's videos and promotional tours, long-time Osbourne collaborator Bob Daisley plays bass on the entire album. Inez is credited as a writer for the title track; although he does not perform on the actual recording, the intro bass riff was composed by him."]}]}}
