Meanwhile, Danny Wilson boosted his squad ahead of the Steel City derby, with Marcus Williams agreeing to stay on loan for a further two months and Matt Phillips and Billy Clarke arriving for a month each from Blackpool. The new arrivals failed to halt the disappointing run of results however as the Blades let a 2\u20130 lead slip to end up drawing with their cross\u2013city rivals.  Despite this disappointment the team bounced back to score an emphatic away win at Preston a few days later with both new signing Matt Phillips and old hand Lee Williamson netting two goals apiece.  With increased competition for first team places, youngsters Danny Philliskirk and Corey Gregory were allowed to go out on loan to Oxford United and Hucknall Town respectively; swiftly followed by Connor Brown who joined Eastwood Town on a months deal.  Back in the league, the disappointing results continued as United threw away a lead once again, allowing ten-men Leyton Orient to snatch a draw with the last kick of the game.  Once again the Blades quickly responded to the setback by beating fellow promotion rivals MK Dons 2\u20131 at Bramall Lane, but then conspired to throw away yet more points, allowing Exeter City to come from behind twice in the closing minutes of the next game to snatch a 4\u20134 draw."]}, {"page": "R v Evans and McDonald", "response": ["Sheffield United academy and reserve team player Connor Brown was suspended by his club after allegedly making offensive comments about the woman on Twitter, although he did not give her name."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Connor Brown", "| width=50px|02|| width=50px|DF || width=300px|Connor Brown || width=50px|29 || width=50px|23 || width=50px|6 || width=50px|25 || width=50px|20 || width=50px|5 || width=50px|4 || width=50px|3 || width=50px|1 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0", "| Connor Brown"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["The Latics faced a summer of rebuilding on and off the pitch as 18 players were out of contract from the 2012\u201313 season and work finally recommenced on the demolition of the old Broadway Stand in preparation for its replacement by the new North Stand.
