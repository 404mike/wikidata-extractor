In 1994, he invented spin-tunneling random access memory. In 2003, Frank proposed a new concept of Grid-oriented Storage architecture. In 2004, Frank and his colleagues launched the UK-first Masters Program in Grid Computing. In 2005, he was elected as the Chairman of UK & Republic of Ireland Chapter of the IEEE Computer Society. In 2007, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Computer Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT", "response": ["* Frank Zhigang Wang, FBCS - inventor of spin-tunneling random access memory"]}, {"page": "Grid-oriented storage", "response": ["Frank Zhigang Wang and Na Helian proposed a funding proposal to the UK government titled \u201cGrid-Oriented Storage (GOS): Next Generation Data Storage System Architecture for the Grid Computing Era\u201d in 2003.

The first conference presentation was at IEEE Symposium on Cluster Computing and Grid (CCGrid), 9\u201312 May 2005, Cardiff, UK. As one of the five best work-in-progress, it was included in the IEEE Distributed Systems Online.
