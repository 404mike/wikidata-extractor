He acted as scorer at least once, for Worcestershire's game against Warwickshire at Dudley in 1913. On this occasion the other scorer was Chicko Austin, who scored in almost 500 first-class games.Conway also played football for Aston Villa and Wolves.He was born in Stirchley, which at that time lay in Worcestershire; he died at the age of 69 in South Shore, Blackpool, Lancashire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["*Best bowling in a match: 15\u201387 by Arthur Conway v.

The land on which the ground was constructed was originally owned by Baron Redesdale of the Mitford family. The ground played a role in popularising croquet, hosting the Croquet Open Championship in 1867, which was won by the pioneer of the sport Walter Whitmore, and hosting the first all-comers meeting for the sport in 1868. Gloucestershire first played first-class cricket at the ground in 1884 against Yorkshire, with the Gloucestershire side being captained by W. G. Grace. In 1886, Gloucestershire played Nottinghamshire there, with Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Shrewsbury making an unbeaten double-century. Gloucestershire played one first-class match there a year until 1888, before returning to the ground in 1914 when they played Worcestershire in the County Championship, with this match being notable for Arthur Conway's 15 wickets in the match. With the advent of List A one-day cricket, Gloucestershire returned to the ground after a 58 year absence when they played Hampshire in the 1972 Benson & Hedges Cup. Gloucestershire played one one-day match per season there until 1996 (with the exception of 1982 and 1995), mostly in the Sunday League.", "* Best bowling in an innings: 9-38 by Arthur Conway, for Worcestershire v Gloucestershire, 1914", "* Best bowling in a match: 15-87 by Arthur Conway, as above"]}, {"page": "Arthur Joseph Conway", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Conway (sportsman)"]}]}}
