He acted as scorer at least once, for Worcestershire's game against Warwickshire at Dudley in 1913. On this occasion the other scorer was Chicko Austin, who scored in almost 500 first-class games.Conway also played football for Aston Villa and Wolves.He was born in Stirchley, which at that time lay in Worcestershire; he died at the age of 69 in South Shore, Blackpool, Lancashire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
