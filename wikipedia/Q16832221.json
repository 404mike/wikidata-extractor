During the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) she was a war correspondent for the Daily Express, and is alleged to have been a press agent for the Comintern. A skilled writer, Ross was also a film critic for the Daily Worker, and her criticisms of early Soviet cinema were later described as ingenious works of \"dialectical sophistry\". Throughout her life she wrote political criticism and anti-fascist polemics, as well as manifestos for a number of disparate organisations such as the British Workers' Film and Photo League. She was a lifelong member of the Communist Party of Great Britain.During her itinerant youth in the Weimar Republic, Ross was a cabaret singer and fashion model in Berlin. Her Berlin escapades served as the basis for the fictional character Sally Bowles in Christopher Isherwood's The Berlin Stories, a work cited by literary critics as deftly capturing the hedonistic nihilism of the Weimar era. The work was later adapted into the stage musical Cabaret. For the remainder of her life, Ross believed the public association of herself with the na\u00efve and apolitical character of Bowles occluded her lifelong work as a professional writer and political activist. Sharing this belief, her daughter Sarah Caudwell later wrote a newspaper article in an attempt to correct the historical record and to dispel misconceptions regarding Ross. According to Caudwell, \"in the transformations of the novel for stage and cinema the characterisation of Sally has become progressively cruder and less subtle and the stories about 'the original' correspondingly more high-coloured\".In addition to inspiring the character of Sally Bowles, Ross is credited by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and other sources as the muse for lyricist Eric Maschwitz's jazz standard \"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)\", one of the 20th century's more enduring love songs. Although Maschwitz's estranged wife Hermione Gingold later claimed the popular song was written for herself or actress Anna May Wong, Maschwitz himself contradicted these claims. Instead, Maschwitz cited memories of a \"young love\", and most scholars posit Maschwitz's youthful affair with Ross as inspiring the song.", "link_mentions": {}}}
