Joining Dundee United in 1968, Reid's performances against Newcastle United in the 1969 Fair Cup won him a somewhat-delayed move to Tyneside in 1971, although he returned to Scotland eighteen months later with Morton. Three seasons later, Reid returned to Dundee United before finishing his career with a couple of appearances for Ayr United.\nAfter retiring in 1977 due to injury, Reid moved to Canada where he died in the year of his 51st birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Reid", "response": ["Alex Reid or Alexander Reid may refer to:", "*Alex Reid (art dealer) (1854\u20131928), Scottish art dealer", "*Alex Reid (footballer, born 1947) (1947\u20131998), Scottish footballer", "*Alex Reid (screenwriter) (born 1965), American TV writer/producer", "*Alex Reid (fighter) (born 1975), English mixed martial artist", "*Alex Reid (actress) (born 1980), English actress", "*Alex Reid (footballer, born 1995), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Alex Reid (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECTAlex Reid (footballer, born 1947)"]}]}}
