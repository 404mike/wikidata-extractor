It proved to be a shrewd move as he excelled in his new position and became a first team regular for the \"Potters\". A back injury that required surgery cost him appearances in 1986\u201387 and arguably Stoke a play-off place. By the end of the 1987\u201388 season it was generally acknowledged that Bould was now the best defender in Division Two. Both Arsenal and Everton made approaches for the defender. After discussions Bould chose Arsenal and a tribunal set the price at \u00a3390,000, a small fee compared to what Stoke were demanding."]}, {"page": "Phil Sproson", "response": ["He featured in two Third Division games towards the end of the 1977\u201378 season. With the \"Valiants\" relegated into the Fourth Division, Sproson found first team chances easier to come by at Vale Park as he played 25 games in the 1978\u201379 season under the stewardship of Dennis Butler. He scored his first senior goal on 15 September 1979, in a 5\u20130 home win over Northampton Town. He established himself in the first team under new boss John McGrath, and played 40 games in the 1979\u201380 season. He went on to feature 50 times in the 1980\u201381 campaign, and missed just three games all season. He scored five goals in 51 games in the 1981\u201382 season, after missing just four league matches. The 1982\u201383 season proved highly successful for Sproson; he was a regular in the first team, claiming four goals in 45 games, and was included in the PFA select Fourth Division side as Vale were promoted in third place. Stoke City manager Richie Barker had tried to sign Sproson earlier in the season, but was put off by Vale's high asking price, so instead signed Paul Dyson."]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["It was apparent during the summer of 1983 at a coaching course at Lilleshall that manager Ritchie Barker was converted to the long ball game. In truth it was used by several sides with great success in 1983\u201384, but not with Stoke. Another youth team product Paul Bracewell was sold to Sunderland for \u00a3250,000 and that money was spent on Paul Dyson and Robbie James. Stoke used their new style of play in their pre-season friendlies which drew some interesting results but was quite clear that the players were unhappy at the change and once the season started they struggled desperately out on the pitch. In their first 24 matches they managed just three wins and in deep relegation trouble and it was no surprise to see Barker sacked by the board.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Paul Dyson"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Paul Dyson"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["The board hoped that this money would be available for Mills to spend on new players but instead it had to be used to reduce the club's overdraft.
