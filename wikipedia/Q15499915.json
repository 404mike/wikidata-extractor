The band formed in the late 1980s and released three albums in the 1990s.\nThe band's beginnings came with the meeting of singer Harriet Wheeler and guitarist David Gavurin while attending Bristol University. Wheeler had played gigs with Cruel Shoes, an early incarnation of the band Jim Jiminee. The duo soon augmented the band with bassist Paul Brindley and drummer Patrick Hannan.\nThe Sundays secured a recording contract with Rough Trade Records. Their debut single was \"Can't Be Sure\". Their first album, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, was released in 1990, along with their next single \"Here's Where the Story Ends\". The album was a UK Top 5 hit.\nWith Rough Trade's financial troubles and the band's decision to manage themselves, The Sundays' next single, \"Goodbye\", did not emerge until 1992. Their next album, Blind, arrived the same year, reaching the UK Top 15. The single \"Love\" reached number 2 on the US Modern Rock charts. The band toured in support of these recordings.\nIn 1997 their third album, Static & Silence, was followed by the release of their most successful single to date, \"Summertime\", which made the UK Top 15. The album itself reached the UK Top 10. However, the band has been on a lengthy hiatus since those releases, with Wheeler and Gavurin focusing on raising their two children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Here's Where the Story Ends", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Harriet Wheeler"]}, {"page": "Harriet (name)", "response": ["* Harriet Wheeler (born 1963), English rock singer"]}, {"page": "List of female rock singers", "response": ["* Harriet Wheeler (The Sundays)"]}, {"page": "Can't Be Sure", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Harriet Wheeler"]}, {"page": "Nicole Atkins", "response": ["She has cited the vocalists Harriet Wheeler of The Sundays and Cass Elliot as important early influences."]}, {"page": "DGC Rarities Vol. 1", "response": ["#The Sundays, \"Don't Tell Your Mother\" (Harriet Wheeler, David Gavurin)\u00a0\u2013 2:36"]}, {"page": "1963 in British music", "response": ["*26 June \u2013 Harriet Wheeler, English singer-songwriter (The Sundays)"]}, {"page": "What the Water Gave Me (song)", "response": ["In the end of the song, Welch tries a \"new, softly-softly vocal style\" which is similar to Liz Fraser and Harriet Wheeler from The Sundays.

Gavurin elaborated that he was inspired to write the song because practices such as joining singles groups and advertising oneself for romance was becoming more \"respectable\", despite the fact that both he and Wheeler believed these practices were \"tragic and funny\" and took away the chance for people to meet face-to-face. Gavurin went on to say, \"And people can really oppress themselves with that mythic picture of romance, so we just wanted to address in a tongue-in-cheek way that the easily gained perfect partnership is indeed a myth.\" The lyrics of the song reflect their beliefs.

Her husband's fingerpicked acoustic guitar anchors tracks like the airy bossa nova 'On Your Side' and the ebb-and-flow of 'St. Francis and the Future'. That crystalline clarity allows the songs that feature more layered arrangements, such as the gorgeous closer 'I Would Be There', to blossom\". He summarized by describing See You Tomorrow as \"an album about, and full of, care, restraint, and love.\" Loud and Quiet called the record an \"introspection of people and how life's daunting uncertainty impacts the love and anxiety attached to those we cherish. It's a reflection of chronology, echoing where and what we've come from whilst simultaneously gazing at the winding road lying ominously ahead.\" They summarized by describing it as \"a body of work that envisions grandiose proportion, sonically embodying the complexity of what makes us unique and innately human.\" The Skinny characterized the album as \"slightly more piano-heavy furrow than before\", describing it \"music made for people who are not quick to dismiss something if it sounds downbeat.\" Despite this, they called the album \"majestic, transcendant , entrancing, transfixing. You're lifted out of yourself as if visited by angels. Other times, such as on album opener 'The Brothers Williams Said', you want to give them a hug, tell them it will be okay, ask them if they need a nice cup of tea. It's serious, is what we're saying; not music for people who want a quick two-second fix of wonderfulness. You have to live with this. Admire its prettiness from afar. Let it work its magic on you.\""]}]}}
