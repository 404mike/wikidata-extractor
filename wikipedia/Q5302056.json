On 11 June 1901, the south side of the Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire, and was practically destroyed before the flames could be extinguished. The recently launched Euryalus was laying alongside this wharf, and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser. Considerable damage was done to the ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of the dock, and her completion was severely delayed. Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs, the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged. While on sea trials, she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport. Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904, nearly two years after her sister ships."]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Douglas Vickers; MP for Sheffield Hallam (1918\u20131922)"]}, {"page": "List of Vanity Fair (British magazine) caricatures (1905\u20131909)", "response": ["|1909-12-3030 Dec 1909||Vickers-DouglasDouglas Vickers||Brightside DV||Spy||M 1207||25px"]}, {"page": "Thomas Vickers", "response": ["In 1860 he married Frances Mary Douglas; they had two sons (Douglas Vickers and Ronald Vickers) and four daughters.", "File:Douglas Vickers.jpg|Douglas Vickers, John Singer Sargent, 1914"]}, {"page": "Vickers (surname)", "response": ["*Douglas Vickers (born 1924), English industrialist and politician"]}, {"page": "List of people buried in Brookwood Cemetery", "response": ["*Douglas Vickers"]}]}}
