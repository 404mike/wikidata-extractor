Within a few months he changed the band name to The Exits, and wrote a whole 4 song set of original material including guitar solos. He turned the band into a three piece called The System and began booking his own shows locally. He was recruited by another band, The Destructors. During the years from 1981 to 1983, Butt co-wrote and recorded a number of their singles (including \"Senseless Violence\", \"Religion\", \"Jailbait\", \"Forces of Law\" and \"Wild Thing\") and the albums (Exercise The Demons of Youth, Armaggedon in Action, Bomb Hanoi, Merry Xmas and F*** Off). By 1984 he had left The Destructors to join the English Dogs.  While in The English Dogs he toured the United States, and it was at this time his fusion of punk and metal based guitar playing started to get him noticed by people such as Metallica and was helping to influence the thrash metal genre \" a lot of the songs you hear on Forward Into Battle were actually written before the (preceding) To the Ends of the Earth EP, so we\u2019re talking about a very \u2018early days\u2019 punk/metal fusion. It was the beginning of that scene, so you\u2019ll still hear a lot of the things that influenced the first English Dogs LP , or even stuff I wrote when I was in The Destructors in 1981-83\u201d. By 1987, the English Dogs came to a halt, and Butt formed another band, Wardance. Andy Sneap produced and mixed the album All The World's A Rage (1995)."]}]}}
