Mencken avidly read and translated Nietzsche's works and has gained the sobriquet \"the American Nietzsche\". In his book on Nietzsche, Mencken portrayed the philosopher as a proponent of anti-egalitarian aristocratic revolution, a depiction in sharp contrast with left-wing interpretations of Nietzsche. Nietzsche was declared an honorary anarchist by Emma Goldman, and he influenced other anarchists such as Guy Aldred, Rudolf Rocker, Max Cafard and John Moore."]}, {"page": "Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche", "response": ["*I Am Not A Man, I Am Dynamite!
