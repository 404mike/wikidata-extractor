Two late goals from Chris Llewellyn and Michael Proctor rubber-stamped Wrexham's survival and saw Boston lose 3\u20131. On 8 May 2007, Evans pledged his commitment to the club despite their relegation and return to non-League football. However, on 27 May, Evans and his assistant manager Paul Raynor resigned from Boston with immediate effect. Evans' two occasions as manager combined at Boston made him the club's second longest serving manager behind Fred Tunstall, who had three occasions as manager of the club in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. He managed the team on 354 occasions, which resulted in 145 wins, 99 draws and 110 losses."]}, {"page": "Kris Taylor", "response": ["Taylor joined Northern Premier League side Hednesford Town on loan in March 2013.
