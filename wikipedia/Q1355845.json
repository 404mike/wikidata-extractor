Philip II of Spain assumed the Portuguese throne in September 1580 and was crowned Philip I of Portugal in 1581 (recognized as king by the Portuguese Cortes of Tomar) and a near sixty-year personal union under the rule of the Philippine Dynasty began. This gave Philip control of the extensive Portuguese empire. When Philip left for Madrid in 1583, he made his nephew Albert of Austria his viceroy in Lisbon. In Madrid he established a Council of Portugal to advise him on Portuguese affairs, giving prominent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish courts, and allowing Portugal to maintain autonomous law, currency, and government. This is on the well-established pattern of rule by councils.", "Historian Geoffrey Parker offers a management-psychological explanation, as summarized by Tonio Andrade and William Reger: One might have expected that Philip\u2014being a dedicated, persistent, and hard-working man, and being the head of Western Europe\u2019s wealthiest and largest empire\u2014would have succeeded in his aims. He didn\u2019t. His endeavors were doomed by his own character, or at least that\u2019s how Parker sees it. Drawing on studies in management science and organizational psychology, Parker argues that a successful manager of a large organization must keep attention on the big picture, must have a good strategy for dealing with copious information, must know how to delegate, and must be flexible. Philip failed on all counts. He was a micromanager who got bogged down in details, refusing to delegate and trying to read every dispatch that came to his desk. He obsessed and dithered, so that by the time his decisions were made and his orders reached the men meant to carry them out, the situation on the ground had changed. Philip was also inflexible, unwilling to abandon ineffective policies. Most pernicious of all was Philip\u2019s tendency toward messianic thinking, a belief that he was doing God\u2019s work and that heaven would support him with miracles.Tonio Andrade and William Reger, eds., \"Geoffrey Parker and Early Modern History\" in The Limits of Empire: European Imperial Formations in Early Modern World History: Essays in Honor of Geoffrey Parker (Routledge, 2016), p. xxiii."]}, {"page": "Poverty", "response": ["Before the Industrial Revolution, poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as economies produced little, making wealth scarce.

This change affected the entire conduct of warfare, since it required the officers to train men in addition to leading them, decreased the size of the basic infantry unit for functional purposes since more specific orders had to be given in battle, and the decrease in herd behavior required more initiative and intelligence from the average soldier.Roberts, op. cit. p. 15 One major contribution was the introduction of volley fire, which enabled soldiers to compensate for the inaccuracy of their weapons by firing in a large group. It was first used in European combat at the battle of Nieuwpoort in 1600.Geoffrey Parker, \"The Limits to Revolutions in Military Affairs: Maurice of Nassau, the Battle of Nieuwpoort (1600), and the Legacy,\" Journal of Military History (2007) 71#2 pp 331\u2013372"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Geoffrey Parker (born 1943), early modern military"]}, {"page": "Diplomatic history", "response": ["* Geoffrey Parker, (born 1943) early modern "]}, {"page": "Musket", "response": ["Frederick Lewis Taylor claims that a kneeling volley fire may have been employed by Prospero Colonna's arquebusiers as early as the Battle of Bicocca (1522).Taylor, Frederick. (1921). The Art of War in Italy, 1494-1529. p. 52. However this has been called into question by Tonio Andrade who believes this is an over interpretation as well as mis-citation of a passage by Charles Oman suggesting that the Spanish arquebusiers kneeled to reload, when in fact Oman never made such a claim. European gunners might have implemented the volley fire to some extent since at least 1579 when the Englishman Thomas Digges suggested that musketeers should, \"after the old Romane manner make three or four several fronts, with convenient spaces for the first to retire and unite himselfe with the second, and both these if occasion so require, with the third; the shot [musketeers] having their convenient lanes continually during the fight to discharge their peces.\" The Spanish too displayed some awareness of the volley technique. Mart\u00edn de Eguiluz described it in the military manual, Milicia, Discurso y Regla Militar, dating to 1586: \"Start with three files of five soldiers each, separated one from the other by fifteen paces, and they should comport themselves not with fury but with calm skillfulness [con reposo diestramente] such that when the first file has finished shooting they make space for the next (which is coming up to shoot) without turning face, countermarching [contrapassando] to the left but showing the enemy only the side of their bodies, which is the narrowest of the body, and [taking their place at the rear] about one to three steps behind, with five or six pellets in their mouths, and two lighted matchlock fuses \u2026 and they load [their pieces] promptly \u2026 and return to shoot when it's their turn again.\" Most historians, including Geoffrey Parker, have ignored Eguiluz, and have erroneously attributed the invention of the countermarch to Maurice of Nassau, although the publication of the Milicia, Discurso y Regla Militar antedates Maurice's first letter on the subject by two years. Regardless, it is clear that the concept of volley fire had existed in Europe for quite some time during the 16th century, but it was in the Netherlands during the 1590s that the musketry volley really took off. The key to this development was William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg who in 1594 described the technique in a letter to his cousin:"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Parker", "response": ["Geoffrey Parker may refer to:", "* Geoffrey Parker (historian) (born 1943), British historian"]}, {"page": "Military Revolution", "response": ["In the 1990s the concept was modified and extended by Geoffrey Parker, who argued that developments in fortification and siege warfare caused the revolution. Parker also argues that the military revolution in Europe gave European powers a distinct advantage, making it possible for the relatively small European powers to conquer the Americas, as well as large parts of Africa and Asia. Parker's argument has been criticized by Cambridge University political scientist Jason Sharman.", "Others have defended a later period for the military change. Jeremy Black thinks that the key time period was that of 1660\u20131710, which saw an exponential growth in the size of European armies,Black, A Military  while Clifford J. Rogers has developed the idea of successive military revolutions at different periods, first an \"infantry revolution\" in the 14th century, secondly an \"artillery revolution\" in the 15th century, thirdly a \"fortifications revolution\" in the 16th, fourth a \"fire weapons\" revolution between 1580 and 1630, and finally a fifth revolution, the increase in size of European armies, between 1650 and 1715.Rogers, The Military  Similarly, Geoffrey Parker has extended the period of the military revolution from 1450 to 1800, the period in which Europeans achieved supremacy over the rest of the world.Geoffrey Parker. 1996. The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West, 1500-1800. Cambridge University Press. Some scholars have questioned the revolutionary character of an evolution through four centuries.;  Clifford Rogers has suggested that the military revolution can best be compared with the concept of \"punctuated equilibrium evolution\" (a theory originating in biology), meaning short bursts of rapid military innovation followed by longer periods of relative stagnation.", "Roberts' linear tactics concept had an early critic in the younger historian Geoffrey Parker, who asked why the supposedly outdated Spanish tercios defeated the Swedish linear formations at the battle of N\u00f6rdlingen in 1634.The Military Revolution, A myth? Parker instead suggested that the key development was the appearance of the trace italienne fortifications in early modern Europe. In this view, the difficulty of taking such fortifications resulted in a profound change in military strategy. \"Wars became a series of protracted sieges\", Parker suggests, and open-pitch battles became \"irrelevant\" in regions where the trace italienne existed. Ultimately, Parker argues, \"military geography\", in other words the existence or absence of the trace italienne in a given area, shaped military strategy in the early modern period, and lead to the creation of larger armies necessary to besiege the new fortresses and to garrison them. In this way, Parker placed the birth of the Military Revolution in the early 16th century. He also gives it a new significance, not only was a factor in the growth of the State, it was also the main factor, together with the \"Naval Revolution\" to the rise of the West over other Civilizations."]}]}}
