During the first Red Sun Eclipse, Russell Lightbourne fell into a psychotic state and killed many of the other original colonists, including Josephine. Gabriel himself survived and dedicated the next twenty-five years of his life to finding a way to bring back those they lost, particularly Josephine. Gabriel eventually discovered a way to resurrect the original colonists by implanting their Mind Drives into mind wiped Nightblood hosts, effectively granting them a form of immortality. The first to be successfully resurrected was Josephine herself. Josephine would later state that Gabriel had already been dying of cancer by the time that he succeeded and Josephine brought him back as she was unwilling to lose him either. Thanks to Gabriel, the original colonists became known as the Primes and ruled over Sanctum, using Nightblood hosts to resurrect themselves. However, Gabriel developed moral concerns about their actions, particularly sacrificing innocent people to save themselves and destroyed the Nightblood embryos in an attempt to stop the resurrections, escaping with the help of Ryker Desai. Over the next seventy years, Gabriel formed the militant group known as the Children of Gabriel, rescuing children sacrificed to the forest by Josephine and became known primarily as \"The Old Man\". Gabriel intended to die with his elderly host, but Eduardo, a loyal follower who was unwilling to let him go, resurrected Gabriel against his wishes in the body of Xavier, a free-born Nightblood amongst the Children of Gabriel. Out of guilt, Gabriel killed Eduardo and lived as Xavier, vanishing to his followers for the next ten years. Despite their differences in ideology, Gabriel never stopped loving Josephine in 236 years, something that Josephine admitted to reciprocating."]}, {"page": "The Good Doctor (TV series)", "response": ["The series stars Freddie Highmore as Shaun Murphy, a young autistic savant surgical resident at the fictional San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.
