Castle was UK number 1 in singles tennis in 1986, reaching as high as World No. 80 in June 1988, and No. 45 in doubles in December 1988, with Tim Wilkison of the United States.\nOn his regular television and radio appearances, including his LBC show, he voiced his disregard to Australia protecting their people against COVID-19. He stated that they should be embarrassed by how they've acted in protecting their borders by not allowing the world number 1 tennis player in, even though he didn't respect the entry requirements.\nCastle reached one Grand Slam final in his career in the 1987 Australian Open mixed doubles event with Anne Hobbs.  He won three ATP titles in men's doubles, as well as one title on the Challenger tour.  He won $344,338 in prize money.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Castle was a presenter on the now defunct ITV breakfast programme GMTV, sharing duties with Ben Shephard to present its weekday magazine programme. In 2009, he began presenting the ITV daytime game show Divided.\nHe has also taken part in Strictly Come Dancing and 71 Degrees North.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 15", "response": ["*1963 \u2013 Andrew Castle, English tennis player and television host"]}, {"page": "The Championships, Wimbledon", "response": ["Since 1937 the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the United Kingdom. Between 1956 and 1968 The Championships were also covered by the ITV Network, but since 1969 the BBC has had a monopoly. The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, BBC One and BBC Two, and their Red Button service. This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels. The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2027.  During the days of British Satellite Broadcasting, its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers. One of the most notable British commentators was Dan Maskell, who was known as the BBC's \"voice of tennis\" until his retirement in 1991. John Barrett succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006. Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players Andrew Castle, John Lloyd, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Samantha Smith and Mark Petchey; tennis legends such as John McEnroe, Tracy Austin, Boris Becker and Lindsay Davenport; and general sports commentators including David Mercer, Barry Davies, Andrew Cotter and Nick Mullins. The coverage is presented by Sue Barker (live) and Claire Balding (highlights).
