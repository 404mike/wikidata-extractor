He grabbed 5/6 in the second innings against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield in 1914, including the wickets of Richard Baggallay, Gilbert Curgenven, Colin Hurt and Thomas Forrester in consecutive balls. His most famous feat was the taking all ten Somerset wickets for 35 at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare in August 1914, when he took 15 in the match for 51 runs. He bowled unchanged throughout both innings of the match. Only Drake, Hedley Verity (twice), and Frank Smailes, have taken all ten wickets in an innings for Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "Arthur Morton (cricketer, born 1883)", "response": ["First-class cricket was suspended during the First World War and resumed in 1919 when Morton was charged with looking after the \"bad boy\" Billy Bestwick who had been allowed back into the Derbyshire team.Bygone Derbyshire Bowler Billy Morton found form again in 1920 scoring a century against Leicestershire and taking 8 for 37 against Somerset and achieving nine 5 wicket innings in all, but none of this helped Derbyshire win a single match. In 1921 he took 8 for 69 in one of his four 5-wicket innings, but was absent for several weeks as a result of an accident. During a match against Yorkshire in June, the Yorkshire player Abe Waddington took Morton for a spin on his motorbike but crashed leaving Morton with broken ribs.Cricinfo Magazine Gilbert Curgenven was injured separately and with eight men left, Derbyshire were out for 23.

When Billy Bestwick and Robert Bestwick shared the bowling against Willie Quaife and Bernard Quaife of Warwickshire, father and son were bowling against father and son.
