signed his first full-time professional contract in August 1998 and was handed a start in the first game of the season in an away match against Hartlepool United. With Cardiff losing 1\u20130, Earnshaw scored a bicycle kick from ten yards out following a cross by John Williams to earn his side a point. However, after appearing in three further matches during the opening month of the season, he spent time away from Cardiff to attend trials with Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson and Fulham under Kevin Keegan. He returned to Cardiff but struggled to break into the side under manager Frank Burrows with Earnshaw later stating that he believed Burrows thought he would not \"make the grade.\" After making a single appearance at the start of the 1999\u20132000 season, Earnshaw was loaned to Scottish side Greenock Morton in January 2000 by Burrows to gain experience and \"toughen up\", living above a local pub. Earnshaw later admitted that the experience at Morton helped him, commenting \"It made me realise that I needed to work hard at my game so I could show Cardiff City that I could become a good player.\" During his loan spell, he played three games in the Scottish Football League First Division, scoring twice, and one Scottish Cup tie against Rangers. Originally signing on an initial three-month loan deal, he was recalled by Cardiff manager Billy Ayre after just one month when he replaced Burrows in charge and made five appearances in the final three months of the season, scoring once in a 2\u20131 defeat to AFC Bournemouth."]}, {"page": "Bath City F.C.", "response": ["| John Williams"]}, {"page": "South Wales derby", "response": ["With the escalation of football hooliganism in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the derbies became plagued by violence led largely by hooligan firms from both sides, Cardiff's Soul Crew and Swansea's Jacks.

Since then, Swansea fans have adopted a \"swim away\" gesture, in reference to the event. During an FA Cup fixture in 1992, 39 fans were arrested at Swansea's Vetch Field after clashes between supporters.
