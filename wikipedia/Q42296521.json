Born in Dysart, Fife, in 1795, George Maclean was the son of William Maclean, himself the son of George MacAllan, a Dysart Colliery manager.George Maclean entered the commissariat department of the army in 1812.  He received the War Medal with two Clasps for Orthes and Toulouse, both battles being in 1814. On 22 October 1816, he was promoted to Deputy Asstistant Commissary General.In about 1834, whilst serving in Nassau, Bahama Islands as an officer in the Commissariat Department, he was ordered to Sierra Leone as Assistant Commissary General of Stores, with his family moving to Dysart, the father\u2019s birthplace and family residence. After five years\u2019 continuous service in Sierra Leone, he was promoted and posted to Hobart, Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), at that time Great Britain\u2019s convict settlement, where among other matters, he was particularly concerned about the cost of mining coal and of the inefficient coal mining operation.   On 23 Dec 1842 he was promoted to Deputy Commissary General.\nBritish concerns at the perceived failure of the British commissariat and transport arrangements in the Crimea led to reviews of those of other nations, and Commissary General George Maclean examined the Austrian system, while a commission, under Major General Knollys, was sent to Paris to learn from the intendance.George Maclean was initially appointed in charge of the arrangements in Constantinople, and subsequently succeeded William Filder as Commissary-General commanding the Commissariat in the East during the latter part of the siege of Sevastopol, for which he was awarded the Medal and Clasp. For his services during the Crimean War, he was appointed a K.C.B. He was also appointed to the Order of the Medjidie, 4th Class. (Constantinople) and Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus, Cross of Commander of the Second Class.George Maclean also served in Spain, Canada and the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Maclean", "response": ["thumb|George Maclean, Governor of Gold Coast ", "George Maclean (2 February 1801 \u2013 22 May 1847) was Governor of Gold Coast, now in Ghana, from 1830 until 1844.", "*Watt, Julie, Poisoned Lives, The Regency Poet Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L.E.L.) and British Gold Coast Administrator George Maclean: Sussex Academic Press, Eastbourne, 2010.
