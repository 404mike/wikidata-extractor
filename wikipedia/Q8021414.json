During his career, he made over 400 appearances in the Football League, scoring 74 times. He began his career with his hometown club Liverpool, making one appearance for the club in 1959, before joining Halifax Town in 1962. He joined Carlisle United in 1964 and went on to make over 100 appearances in all competitions for the club, helping them win the Third Division in 1965.\nAfter one season with Sheffield United, Carlin was persuaded to join Derby County by manager Brian Clough and went on to play a pivotal role in the Rams Second Division title winning side during the 1968\u201369 season and played one season in the First Division for the club. He later finished his career with spells at Leicester City, Notts County and Cardiff City. Standing at five foot and four inches and weighing less than 10 stone, Carlin became well known for his diminutive size and his tenacity on the pitch, being described by Brian Clough as \"a belligerent, aggressive little Scouser\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Clough", "response": ["In Clough's first season, the club finished one place lower than in the previous season, but he had started to lay the foundations for his future success by signing several new players, among them Roy McFarland, John O'Hare, John McGovern, Alan Hinton and Les Green. Of the inherited squad, 11 players departed and only four were retained: Kevin Hector, Alan Durban, Ron Webster and Colin Boulton. Clough also sacked the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a Derby defeat. With the additional signings of Dave Mackay and Willie Carlin in 1968, Clough and Taylor's management led Derby to become champions of Division Two, establishing the club record of 22 matches without defeat on the way."]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Willie Carlin"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["There were promotions to the first-team for local-born 22-year-old defender John Nicholson and 18-year-old inside forward Willie Carlin - the latter a promising youngster who had represented his country at schoolboy and youth levels; 19-year-old full back Alan Jones, a Welsh schoolboy international who had signed professional forms for Liverpool two years earlier; Wrexham-born forward Reginald Blore who had risen through the junior ranks at Anfield; 17-year-old midfielder Ian Callaghan from Toxteth, considered by Liverpool legend Billy Liddell to be his successor; and 20-year-old striker Roger Hunt, signed a year earlier by Phil Taylor when he was brought to his attention playing for Stockton Heath.", "*  Willie Carlin"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Willie Carlin"]}, {"page": "John Nicholson (footballer, born 1936)", "response": ["Nicholson signed professional forms with Liverpool in January 1957 to become understudy to Dick White.

The season itself started in unconvincing fashion with two draws and two defeats. Carlin, brought from Sheffield United for \u00a360,000 as the final piece of Clough's jigsaw, made his debut in the fifth game of the season, a 2\u20132 home draw with Hull City and from there the club lost just three of its remaining 37 fixtures, including winning the final 9, a club record. A 3\u20132 win at Blackpool on 8 March 1969 kicked started an unbeaten sequence which did not end for 22 matches and the following season with a 1\u20130 defeat away to Sheffield Wednesday on 27 September 1969, another club record and the final tally of just 5 defeats from 42 league fixtures was also unmatched in the club's history. The club also had another notable League Cup run, reaching the quarter finals and beating top-flight Everton and Chelsea in successive rounds, before again being knocked out by the competition's eventual winners, falling 1\u20130 away to Swindon Town in a replay. Promotion saw Derby return to the top flight for the first time in 16 years and Dave Mackay's performances saw him named Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, alongside Manchester City's Tony Book, the only Derby County player to earn the honour."]}, {"page": "Derby County F.C.\u2013Leicester City F.C. rivalry", "response": ["* Willie Carlin"]}, {"page": "Carlin (name)", "response": ["* Willie Carlin (born 1940), football player"]}, {"page": "William Carlin (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Willie Carlin"]}]}}
