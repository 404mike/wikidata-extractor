He spoke of Christmas as a festival of peace and lamented that \"it is the tragedy of this time that there are powerful countries whose whole direction and policy are based on aggression and the suppression of all that we hold dear for mankind.\" He continued, saying: \"It is this that has stirred our peoples and given them a unity unknown in any previous war. We feel in our hearts that we are fighting against wickedness, and this conviction will give us strength from day to day to persevere until victory is assured.\" He spoke of his pride in the Royal Navy's courage and devotion in its battles in the first months of the war as well as the courage of the merchant marine. He also expressed thanks to the British Expeditionary Force and other armies of the Empire saying that \"Their task is hard. They are waiting, and waiting is a trial of nerve and discipline. But I know that when the moment comes for action they will prove themselves worthy of the highest traditions of their great Service.\" He referred to the nations and colonies of the Empire as a \"Family of Nations which is prepared to sacrifice everything that freedom of spirit may be saved to the world\" and referred to the assistance Britain has received from the rest of the Empire. George VI referred to \"the cause of Christian civilisation\" as what unites the Empire and its Allies, adding that \"On no other basis can a true civilisation be built.\" He concluded with words of encouragement from the poem God Knows by Minnie Louise Haskins: 'I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, \"Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.\" And he replied, \"Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God.

However, the next five years saw a reduction in membership to 250 coinciding with the rapid collapse in industrial output as the government sought to reduce the national debt. Again in 1924 on incorporation the organisation changed its name to the Institute of Industrial Welfare Workers (IIWW). Minnie Louise Haskins, the author of the famous poem The Gate of the Year and a lecturer at LSE, was closely involved with the IIWW and edited its monthly bulletin.  As a consequence of the activities of welfare workers during the General Strike of 1926 distrust in the welfare movement grew amongst trade unions which saw a new breed of 'labour managers' part of 'management' which was reflected in 1931 when the IIWW became the Institute of Labour Management and its magazine, rebranded Labour Management. Members of the institute experienced new demands during the 1930s. Firstly, economic growth resulted in a shortfall in skilled labour as companies competed to recruit workers. Secondly, this was followed by lay-offs and industrial action as a worldwide depression took hold, particularly in the industrially-focussed north of England. This influence also had the effect of increasing the number of male members of the institute which significantly shifted the gender balance of the membership. Thirdly, new human relations practices developed in the US were finding their way into more enlightened business which invested in their employees through training and provision of such things as salary benefits, pensions and paid holidays. In 1938 the first of the institute branches opened in the Republic of Ireland. In 1939 membership stood at 760. Mirroring the First World War during World War II, the government insisted on personnel officers to be deployed in factories engaged in war-related production."]}, {"page": "Minnie Haskins", "response": ["#redirect Minnie Louise Haskins"]}, {"page": "1939 in British radio", "response": ["* 25 December \u2013 In his Christmas broadcast on BBC Radio,  King George VI quotes Minnie Louise Haskins' poem \"The Gate of the Year\"."]}]}}
