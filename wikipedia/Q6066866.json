He also said in 1994, \"If you study modern groups, those who gain press coverage and chart action, none of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact\". When asked \"who do you regret not going to see live\", guitarist Johnny Marr replied \"Siouxsie and the Banshees mk 1. But mk 2 were even better\". Marr mentioned his liking for John McGeoch and his contribution to the single \"Spellbound\". Marr qualified it as \"clever\" with a \"really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll\".Mitchell, Pete. \"Spellbound : the story of John McGeoch\" BBC2. February 2008. Retrieved 1 November 2010. About McGeoch's contribution to the single \"Spellbound\", Marr stated: \"It's so clever. He's got this really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll and this actual tune he's playing is really quite mysterious\". Radio 2's Pete Mitchell talks to Howard Devoto, Siouxsie Sioux and Johnny Marr among others, as he shines a light on the life of this unsung guitar hero. Smiths' historian Goddard wrote that Marr \"praise[d] the McGeoch-era Banshees as a significant inspiration\". U2 cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as a major influence and selected \"Christine\" for a Mojo compilation. The Edge was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at the Mojo ceremony in 2005. In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. Gahan later hailed the single \"Candyman\" at its release, saying, \"She always sounds exciting. She sings with a lot of sex - that's what I like. This is a great Banshees record[...], I like their sound. I used to see them quite a lot when I was younger.\" Commenting on the original Banshees line-up and they were different from other groups, Gahan said:  \"Siouxsie And The Banshees, whom I adored, sang much more abstract, artistic about frustration. Colder and darker\". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected \"Jigsaw Feeling\" from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited \"Hong Kong Garden\" in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, saying \"it was a completely new world\". Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences. Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once noted a parallel between his band and the Banshees: \"There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees\". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, \"They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We\u2019re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we\u2019re coming from\".  He stated : \"the last great rock bands were Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] the best post-punk bands for me.

Its B-side, \"Velocity Girl\", was released on the C86 compilation, which led to their being associated with the scene of the same name.

John Moore had become an established member, but moved to rhythm guitar, with former Redskins member Martin Hewes joining the band briefly (although he strongly denies ever joining) and former Dead Can Dance percussionist James Pinker taking over on drums. Blanco y Negro manager Geoff Travis took over management duties, and the band returned in December with two gigs at the National Ballroom in Kilburn, London, where they premiered new songs including \"April Skies\" and \"Hit\". Early in 1987, they entered the studio to record their second album. The first fruits of these sessions were released on the \"April Skies\" single in April, which saw the band have their first top ten hit. The Beach Boys influence was evident on the B-side, which included \"Kill Surf City\", a reworking of Brian Wilson's \"Surf City\". The various formats released also included a cover of Bo Diddley's \"Who Do You Love?\", a tribute to him with \"Bo Diddley is Jesus\", and a live version of Can's \"Mushroom\". \"Happy When It Rains\" was the second pre-album single, strongly influenced by Smokey Robinson's \"My Girl\", but it failed to match the success of \"April Skies\", only reaching number twenty-five.

They toured without a drummer, instead using a drum machine.", "The band's dangerous reputation culminated at a gig at the RPM club in Toronto in November 1987, when after being heckled throughout the gig by a group in the audience, Jim Reid thrust his microphone stand towards them, hitting one on the head.

Jim appeared onstage apparently drunk and barely able to stand or sing. William walked offstage about 15 minutes into their set, and the show ended. The audience was later refunded the price of their tickets. The band finished up their U.S. and Japanese dates without William, but from that point, it was clear that the band was at its end. Jim Reid said in 2006 of the tension between himself and William: \"After each tour we wanted to kill each other, and after the final tour we tried\".", "Immediately after the split, William Reid went solo as Lazycame\u2014having already released a solo EP in April 1998\u2014and Jim Reid founded Freeheat along with Lurie and ex-Gun Club bassist Romi Mori and Earl Brutus drummer Nick Sanderson, although neither act received much attention or found any success. In October 2005, it was announced that the Reids were reunited; Jim Reid's track \"Song for a Secret\" a duet with his wife Julie Barber, was released as a single, paired up with Sister Vanilla's \"Can't Stop The Rock\", which was written and produced by William Reid and the brothers' younger sibling, Linda. The single was released by Transistor Records on 17 October. Jim Reid promoted his side of the single with a very rare solo gig at London's Sonic Cathedral club on John Peel Day, Thursday 13 October 2005. He finished this appearance with a performance of the early Mary Chain classic \"Never Understand\". Jim Reid also performed new material at low-key gigs with a new band comprising Phil King on guitar, Laurence Colbert (Ride) on drums and bassist Mark Crozer (International Jetsetters).", "In an interview to Uncut magazine, Jim Reid announced that a new album by the band was in the works. In March 2008, the band released a studio recording of \"All Things Must Pass\" on the soundtrack album to the NBC television drama Heroes. It was their first new song released since 1998. In September, Rhino Records released a 4-CD box set entitled The Power of Negative Thinking: B-Sides & Rarities.
