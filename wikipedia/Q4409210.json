Although he was out of contract at Exeter, Stevenage still had to pay a fee for the player because Dunne was under 24 years of age. The fee for Dunne was set by a tribunal after the two clubs failed to agree a price for the player. This fee was later revealed as an initial \u00a375,000, with a further \u00a350,000 payment dependent on appearances. The move reunited Dunne with then Stevenage manager Gary Smith, who had previously coached him during his time at Wimbledon. He made a goalscoring debut in Stevenage's 3\u20131 home win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup, taking advantage of Seb Brown's goalkeeping mistake, tapping the ball into an empty net, to double Stevenage's lead shortly before half-time. Dunne scored his second goal for the club in November 2012, netting with a 30-yard effort in a 3\u20132 away defeat to Rotherham United in the FA Cup. Three days after his strike against Rotherham, on 6 November, Dunne was on the scoresheet again, this time netting with a low drive, Stevenage's third of the match, in a 3\u20131 away victory against Yeovil Town. His fourth goal of the season came in the club's first home game of 2013, rifling in a shot from 30-yards to give Stevenage the lead in an eventual 2\u20131 defeat to Doncaster Rovers. Dunne added to his tally the following month, scoring from the edge of the area in another 2\u20131 home loss, this time to Oldham Athletic. He scored in Stevenage's next match three days later, on 23 February 2013, his sixth of the campaign, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Shrewsbury Town at New Meadow. Dunne made 45 appearances and scored six times in his first season with the club.

The hosts opened the scoring after fifteen minutes when Luke Freeman drove a left-wing ball across goal, which was ultimately turned into his own net by AFC Wimbledon defender Pim Balkestein. Stevenage doubled their advantage seven minutes before the interval. AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper Seb Brown mis-timed a heavy defensive back pass, with the ball falling to debutant James Dunne, who slotted the ball into an empty net. The visitors responded immediately, Brendan Kiernan reducing the deficit when he successfully connected with a Luke Moore cross. Just four minutes later, in first-half injury time, Stevenage restored their two-goal cushion. A Greg Tansey free-kick was met on the half-volley by Marcus Haber; with Haber's volley goalbound, captain Mark Roberts slid in at the back post to ensure the ball crossed the line.
