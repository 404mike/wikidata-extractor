Under his leadership, his resistance cell distributed anti-fascist propaganda throughout Jersey, blew up German ammunition caches, assassinated German soldiers, and successfully sheltered Jews and escaped Soviet POWs. By 1945, he had successfully convinced anti-Nazi German soldiers to plot a mutiny against their officers; however, the island was liberated by Allied forces before the mutiny could begin. After the war, he became a Human rights activist, campaigning for a minimum wage, equitable divorce laws, compulsory school education and health insurance, and the introduction of a minimum wage. He also won several elections throughout the 1960s and 70s to serve as a Jersey State Deputy. Brocq was a life-long member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\nLater in life, Brocq was extremely bitter towards Jersey's government and police who had gone unpunished despite collaborating with the German occupation by reporting the island's Jews, many of whom were subsequently sent to Auschwitz and Belsen. Whilst his leadership of the resistance went unrecognised by the British government, many officials who had collaborated with the Nazis had been awarded OBE titles and knighthoods.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
