Under his leadership, his resistance cell distributed anti-fascist propaganda throughout Jersey, blew up German ammunition caches, assassinated German soldiers, and successfully sheltered Jews and escaped Soviet POWs. By 1945, he had successfully convinced anti-Nazi German soldiers to plot a mutiny against their officers; however, the island was liberated by Allied forces before the mutiny could begin. After the war, he became a Human rights activist, campaigning for a minimum wage, equitable divorce laws, compulsory school education and health insurance, and the introduction of a minimum wage. He also won several elections throughout the 1960s and 70s to serve as a Jersey State Deputy. Brocq was a life-long member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\nLater in life, Brocq was extremely bitter towards Jersey's government and police who had gone unpunished despite collaborating with the German occupation by reporting the island's Jews, many of whom were subsequently sent to Auschwitz and Belsen. Whilst his leadership of the resistance went unrecognised by the British government, many officials who had collaborated with the Nazis had been awarded OBE titles and knighthoods.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jersey", "response": ["During the Second World War, some citizens were evacuated to the UK but most remained. Jersey was occupied by Germany from 1 July 1940 until 9 May 1945, when Germany surrendered. During this time the Germans constructed many fortifications using Soviet slave labour. After 1944, supplies from France were interrupted by the D-Day landings, and food on the island became scarce. The SS Vega was sent to the island carrying Red Cross supplies and news of the success of the Allied advance in Europe. During the Nazi occupation, a resistance cell was created by communist activist Norman Le Brocq and the Jersey Communist Party, whose communist ideology of forming a 'United Front' led to the creation of the Jersey Democratic Movement. The Channel Islands were one of the last places in Europe to be liberated. 9 May is celebrated as the island's Liberation Day, where there are celebrations in Liberation Square."]}, {"page": "Jersey Communist Party", "response": ["During the Second World War, when Jersey was under Nazi occupation, the JCP-leader Norman Le Brocq led a resistance group called Jersey Democratic Movement.

In 1930 the CPGB founded the Daily Worker (Morning Star), which outlived the party and is currently the largest and longest-running socialist newspaper in British history. In 1936 many members of the party were present at the Battle of Cable Street, helping organise resistance against the British Union of Fascists. During the Spanish Civil War the CPGB worked with the USSR to create the International Brigades, recruiting well over half of the 2,500 members of the British Battalion, which party activist Bill Alexander later commanded. During WWII, several young CPGB activists led by a teenage Norman Le Brocq founded and led the resistance against the German occupation of Jersey, creating the Jersey Democratic Movement to the various resistance cells.  Leading CPGB activists were involved in protests for public access to bomb shelters, organising the evacuation of 3 million children to the countryside, and were heavily involved in post-war negotiations concerning educational reform and the creation of the British National Health Service (NHS).

Peter Tabb suggests that they were involved in the blowing up of the Palace Hotel and of separate ammo dumps; in fact it is more likely that their involvement was to set fire to the hotel, and the German efforts to put out the subsequent blaze by using dynamite to create a breach between the flames were misjudged and set off charges in a neighbouring ammo dump. Nevertheless, the JCP do seem to have made many plans for organised resistance.Tabb, A Peculiar Occupation, (Jersey 2005)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 1996", "response": ["*Norman Le Brocq, 74, British communist, trade union activist, and resistance leader during World War II."]}]}}
