Together with Joe Farman and Brian G. Gardiner he discovered the \"Ozone Hole\" in the 1980s.Shanklin has described his role at the BAS as being that of a \"general dogsbody\" at the time of the discovery of the \"ozone hole\". He calibrated an instrument called the Dobson Ozone Spectrophotometer which provided data on atmospheric ozone.\nIn an article discussing the discovery, the BBC quotes him as saying\n\nPerhaps the most startling lesson from the ozone hole is just how quickly our planet can change. Given the speed with which humankind can affect it, following the precautionary principle is likely to be the safest road to future prosperity.\nShanklin maintains the ozone pages at BAS.\nHe plays cricket, is a bell-ringer, an active local naturalist and is a keen amateur astronomer, being Director of the British Astronomical Association's Comet Section [1].\nIn December 2020 it was announced that the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee had named a glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula after Shanklin, in part to mark the 200th anniversary of the discovery of the continent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Montreal Protocol", "response": ["Then, in 1985, British Antarctic Survey scientists Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jon Shanklin published results of abnormally low ozone concentrations above Halley Bay near the South Pole. They speculated that this was connected to increased levels of CFCs in the atmosphere. It took several other attempts to establish the Antarctic losses as real and significant, especially after NASA had retrieved matching data from its satellite recordings. The impact of these studies, the metaphor 'ozone hole', and the colourful visual representation in a time lapse animation proved shocking enough for negotiators in Montreal, Canada, to take the issue seriously.Grundmann, Reiner, Transnational Environmental Policy: Reconstructing Ozone, London: Routledge, "]}, {"page": "Aerosol spray", "response": ["In 1974, Drs. Frank Sherwood Rowland and Mario J. Molina proposed that chlorofluorocarbons, used as propellants in aerosol sprays, contributed to the depletion of Earth's ozone layer. In response to this theory, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1977 authorizing the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere.Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 (, p. 726) The United Nations Environment Programme called for ozone layer research that same year, and, in 1981, authorized a global framework convention on ozone layer protection. In 1985, Joe Farman, Brian G. Gardiner, and Jon Shanklin published the first scientific paper detailing the hole in the ozone layer. That same year, the Vienna Convention was signed in response to the UN's authorization. Two years later, the Montreal Protocol, which regulated the production of CFCs was formally signed. It came into effect in 1989. The U.S. formally phased out CFCs in 1995."]}, {"page": "Joe Farman", "response": ["Joseph Charles Farman CBE (7 August 193011 May 2013) was a British geophysicist who worked for the British Antarctic Survey.
