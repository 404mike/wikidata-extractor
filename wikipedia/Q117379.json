The track \"Love Hangover\" by Diana Ross, the house anthem at the former, was cited as a particular favourite by many early UK punks.England's Dreaming, Jon Savage Faber & Faber 1991, pp 93, 95, 185\u2013186"]}, {"page": "Goth subculture", "response": ["In 1979, Sounds described Joy Division as \"Gothic\" and \"theatrical\". In February 1980, Melody Maker qualified the same band as \"masters of this Gothic gloom\". Critic Jon Savage would later say that their singer Ian Curtis wrote \"the definitive Northern Gothic statement\". However, it was not until the early 1980s that gothic rock became a coherent music subgenre within post-punk, and that followers of these bands started to come together as a distinctly recognizable movement. They may have taken the \"goth\" mantle from a 1981 article published in UK rock weekly Sounds: \"The face of Punk Gothique\", written by Steve Keaton. In a text about the audience of UK Decay, Keaton asked: \"Could this be the coming of Punk Gothique? With Bauhaus flying in on similar wings could it be the next big thing?\" The F Club night in Leeds in Northern England, which had opened in 1977 firstly as a punk club, became instrumental to the development of the goth subculture in the 1980s. In July 1982, the opening of the Batcave in London's Soho provided a prominent meeting point for the emerging scene, which would be briefly labelled \"positive punk\" by the NME in a special issue with a front cover in early 1983. The term Batcaver was then used to describe old-school goths."]}, {"page": "Joy Division", "response": ["Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Wilson said the success turned the indie label into a true business and a \"revolutionary force\" that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an \"opaque manifesto\" and declared it \"one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year\".", "The suicide shocked the band and their management. In 2005, Wilson said: \"I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen\u00a0... We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were.\" Music critic Simon Reynolds said Curtis's suicide \"made for instant myth\". Jon Savage's obituary said that \"now no one will remember what his work with Joy Division was like when he was alive; it will be perceived as tragic rather than courageous\". In June 1980, Joy Division's single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" was released, which hit number thirteen on the UK Singles Chart. In July 1980, Closer was released, and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart. NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, \"Closer is as magnificent a memorial (for 'Joy Division' as much as for Ian Curtis) as any post-Presley popular musician could have.\"", "Joy Division took time to develop their style and quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as fairly generic and \"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \"really became apparent as the songs got slower\", and their music took on a \"sparse\" quality. According to Reynolds, \"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\" By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands).", "Curtis was the band's sole lyricist, and he typically composed his lyrics in a notebook, independently of the eventual music to evolve. The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\" while noting that \"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were \"obvious influences\" to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse."]}, {"page": "Kurt Cobain", "response": ["The Beatles were an early and lasting influence on Cobain; his aunt Mari remembers him singing \"Hey Jude\" at the age of two. \"My aunts would give me Beatles records\", Cobain told Jon Savage in 1993, \"so for the most part [I listened to] the Beatles [as a child], and if I was lucky, I'd be able to buy a single.\" Cobain expressed a particular fondness for John Lennon, whom he called his \"idol\" in his posthumously released journals, and he said that he wrote the song \"About a Girl\", from Nirvana's 1989 debut album Bleach, after spending three hours listening to Meet the Beatles!."]}, {"page": "Punk rock", "response": ["After a brief period unofficially managing the New York Dolls, Briton Malcolm McLaren returned to London in May 1975, inspired by the new scene he had witnessed at CBGB.

Among those who frequented the shop were members of a band called the Strand, which McLaren had also been managing. In August, the group was seeking a new lead singer. Another Sex habitu\u00e9, Johnny Rotten, auditioned for and won the job. Adopting a new name, the group played its first gig as the Sex Pistols on 6 November 1975, at Saint Martin's School of Art, and soon attracted a small but dedicated following.Gimarc (2005), p. 22; Robb (2006), p. 114; Savage (1992), p. 129. In February 1976, the band received its first significant press coverage; guitarist Steve Jones declared that the Sex Pistols were not so much into music as they were \"chaos\".Savage (1992), pp. 151\u2013152. The quote has been incorrectly ascribed to McLaren (e.g., Laing [1985], pp. 97, 127) and Rotten (e.g., \"Punk Music in Britain\" , BBC, October 7, 2002), but Savage directly cites the New Musical Express issue in which the quote originally appeared. Robb (2006), p. 148, also describes the NME article in some detail and ascribes the quote to Jones. The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, \"Bet you don't hate us as much as we hate you!\"Quoted in Friedlander and Miller (2006), p. 252. McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, \"hard and tough\".Quoted in Savage (1992), p. 163.

The Banshees embarked on a major tour to promote the album. A few dates into the tour in September, Morris and McKay left an in-store signing after an argument and quit the band. In need of replacements to fulfill tour dates, the Banshees' manager called drummer Budgie, formerly with the Slits, and asked him to audition. Budgie was hired, but Siouxsie and Severin had no success auditioning guitarists. Robert Smith of the Cure offered his services in case they could not find a guitarist (his group were already the support band on the tour), so the band held him to it after seeing too many \"rock virtuosos\".

The band also settled on a name. After considering options such as Le Bomb, Subterraneans, the Damned, Beyond, Teenage Novel, Kid Gladlove, and Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me, they decided on Sex Pistols\u2014a shortened form of the name they had apparently been working under informally.Evans, Mike, Rock 'n' Roll's Strangest Moments, p. 190; Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 64\u201365. Matlock says the band decided on the name while McLaren was in the United States\u2014no later than May 1975\u2014before Rotten even joined (p. 65). Jon Savage says the name was not firmly settled on until just before their first show in November 1975 (England's Dreaming, p. 129). McLaren later said the name derived \"from the idea of a pistol, a pin-up, a young thing, a better-looking assassin\". Not given to modesty, false or otherwise, he added: \"[I] launched the idea in the form of a band of kids who could be perceived as being bad.\"Molon, Dominic, \"Made with the Highest British Attention\", p. 76. The group began writing original material: Rotten was the lyricist and Matlock the primary melody writer (though their first collaboration, \"Pretty Vacant\", had a complete lyric by Matlock, which Rotten tweaked a bit); official credit was shared equally among the four.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 99\u2013100.Reynolds, Simon, \"Ono, Eno, Arto\", p. 89.", "These interests were shared with Jamie Reid, an old friend of McLaren who began producing publicity material for the Sex Pistols in the spring of 1976.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 201\u2013202. The cut-up lettering (like that used in the notes left by kidnappers or terrorists) employed to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band was actually introduced by McLaren's friend Helen Wallington-Lloyd.Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 86; Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 201; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 111. \"We used to talk to John [Lydon] a lot about the Situationists,\" Reid later said. \"The Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren't getting the message from left-wing politics.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 204\u2013205. McLaren was also arranging for the band's first photo sessions.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 151. As described by music historian Jon Savage, \"With his green hair, hunched stance and ragged look, [Lydon] looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 114. For more on Lydon's apparently coincidental resemblance to Hell, see also Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, p. 71, and Matlock and Pirroni quotes in Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 111\u2013112, 183.", "On 4 and 6 July, respectively, two newly formed London punk rock acts, the Clash\u2014with Strummer as lead vocalist\u2014and the Damned, made their live debuts opening for the Sex Pistols. On their off night in between, the Pistols (despite Lydon's later professed disdain) showed up for a Ramones gig at Dingwalls, like virtually everyone else at the heart of the London punk scene.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 199\u2013201. During a return Manchester engagement, 20 July, the Pistols premiered a new song, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", reflecting elements of the radical ideologies to which Rotten was being exposed. According to Jon Savage, \"there seems little doubt that Lydon was fed material by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid, which he then converted into his own lyric.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 204. \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" was among the seven originals recorded in another demo session that month, this one overseen by the band's sound engineer, Dave Goodman.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 118\u2013119; Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 205. McLaren organized a major event for 29 August at the Screen on the Green in London's Islington district: the Buzzcocks and The Clash opened for the Sex Pistols in punk's \"first metropolitan test of strength\".Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 207\u2013209; Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 212\u2013215. Quote: Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 207. Three days later, the band were in Manchester to tape what was their first television appearance, for Tony Wilson's So It Goes. Scheduled to perform just one song, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", the band ran straight through another two numbers as pandemonium broke out in the control room.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 126\u2013129.", "\"Anarchy in the U.K.\" was not the first British punk single, pipped by The Damned's \"New Rose\". \"We Vibrate\" had also appeared from The Vibrators, a pub rock band formed early in 1976 that had become associated with punk\u2014though, according to Jon Savage \"with their long hair and mildly risqu\u00e9 name, the Vibrators were passers-by as far as punk taste-makers were concerned.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 221. Unlike those songs, whose lyrical content was comfortably within rock 'n' roll traditions, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" linked punk to a newly politicised attitude\u2014the Pistols' stance was aggrieved, euphoric and nihilistic, all at the same time. Rotten's howls of \"I am an anti-Christ\" and \"Destroy!\" repurposed rock as an ideological weapon.Hatch, David, and Stephen Millward, From Blues to Rock, pp. 168, 170. The single's packaging and visual promotion also broke new ground. Reid and McLaren came up with the notion of selling the record in a completely wordless, featureless black sleeve.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 253. The primary image associated with the single was Reid's \"anarchy flag\" poster: A ripped up and partly safety-pinned back together Union Flag, with the song and band names clipped along the edges of a gaping hole in the middle. This and other images created by Reid for the Sex Pistols quickly became punk icons.Pardo, Alona, \"Jamie Reid\", p. 245.", "In February 1977, word leaked out that Matlock was leaving the Sex Pistols. On 28 February, McLaren sent a telegram to the NME confirming the split. He claimed that Matlock had been \"thrown out...because he went on too long about Paul McCartney....The Beatles was too much.\"Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 56. In an interview a few months afterwards, Steve Jones echoed the charge that Matlock had been sacked because he \"liked The Beatles\". Years later, Jones expanded on the matter of the band's issues with Matlock: \"He was a good writer but he didn't look like a Sex Pistol and he was always washing his feet. His mum didn't like the songs.\" See also later Lydon quote: Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 307\u2013308. Matlock told the NME that he had voluntarily left the band by \"mutual agreement\". Later, in his autobiography, he described the primary impetus as his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten, exacerbated\u2014in Matlock's account\u2014by the rampant inflation of Rotten's ego \"once he'd had his name in the papers\".Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 113\u2013119, 162, 167\u2013171. Quote: p. 115. Lydon later claimed that \"God Save the Queen\", the belligerently sardonic song planned as the band's second single, had been the final straw: \"[Matlock] couldn't handle those kinds of lyrics. He said it declared us fascists.\" Though the singer could hardly see how anti-royalism equated with fascism, he claimed, \"Just to get rid of him, I didn't deny it.\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 3. See also pp. 82, 103. Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out in an effort to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 308. Matlock almost immediately formed his own band, Rich Kids, with Midge Ure, Steve New, and Rusty Egan.", "Given Vicious's incompetence, Matlock had been invited to record as a session musician. In his autobiography, Matlock says he agreed to \"help out\", but then suggests that he cut all ties after McLaren issued the 28 February NME telegram announcing Matlock had been fired for liking the Beatles.Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Pistol, pp. 170\u2013171. According to Jon Savage, Matlock did play as a hired hand on 3 March, for what Savage describes as an \"audition session\".Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 309. In his autobiography, Lydon claims that Matlock's work-for-hire for his ex-band was extensive\u2014much more so than any other source reports\u2014seemingly to amplify a putdown: \"I think I'd rather die than do something like that.\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 142. See also p. 200. Music historian David Howard states unambiguously that Matlock did not perform on any of the Never Mind the Bollocks recording sessions.Howard, David, Sonic Alchemy, p. 245.", "Along with their abundant musical influence, the Sex Pistols' cultural reverberations are evident elsewhere. Jamie Reid's work for the band is regarded as among the most important graphic design of the 1970s and still influences the field in the 21st century.Raimes, Jonathan et al., Retro Graphics, p. 164; \"Jamie Reid: The Art of Punk\" (June 2004), Computer Arts , pp. 46\u201348. By the age of twenty-one, Sid Vicious was already a \"t-shirt-selling icon\".Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 235. While the manner of his death signified for many the inevitable failure of punk's social ambitions, it cemented his image as an archetype of doomed youth.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 530. British punk fashion, still widely influential, is now customarily credited to Westwood and McLaren; as Johnny Rotten, Lydon had a lasting effect as well, especially through his bricolage approach to personal style: he \"would wear a velvet collared drape jacket (ted) festooned with safety pins (Jackie Curtis through the New York punk scene), massive pin-stripe pegs (modernist), a pin-collar Wemblex (mod) customised into an Anarchy shirt (punk) and brothel creepers (ted).\"Douglas, Mark, \"Fashions, Youth\", pp. 188\u2013189. Quote: Jon Savage, in Mulholland, Neil, The Cultural Devolution, p. 72. Christopher Nolan, director of the Batman movie The Dark Knight, has said that Rotten inspired the characterization of The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. According to Nolan, \"We very much took the view in looking at the character of the Joker that what's strong about him is this idea of anarchy. This commitment to anarchy, this commitment to chaos.\" ", "He claimed that the Sex Pistols were his personal, Situationist-style art project: \"I decided to use people, just the way a sculptor uses clay.\" But what had he supposedly made? The Sex Pistols were as substantial as pop culture could get: \"Punk became the most important cultural phenomenon of the late 20th century\", McLaren later asserted. \"Its authenticity stands out against the karaoke ersatz culture of today, where everything and everyone is for sale.... [P]unk is not, and never was, for sale.\" Or they were a cynical con: something with which \"to sell trousers\", as McLaren said in 1989;Hibbert, Tom (August 1989), \"Pernicious?

See also Temple's script for the film's promotional video: Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, pp. 328\u2013329.", "According to Pistols tour manager Noel Monk and journalist Jimmy Guterman, Lydon was much more than \"the band's mouthpiece. He's its raging brain. McLaren or his friend Jamie Reid might drop a word like 'anarchy' or 'vacant' that Rotten seizes upon and turns into a manifesto, but McLaren is not the Svengali to Rotten he'd like to be perceived as.

On the other hand, there is little disagreement about McLaren's marketing talent and his crucial role in making the band a subcultural phenomenon soon after its debut.Monk, Noel, and Jimmy Guterman, 12 Days on the Road, p. 77.

It lasted for just two issues, but was cited in the Situationist tract On the Poverty of Student Life as an example of one of the \"profoundly revolutionary tendencies in the critique of all aspects of the prevailing way of life.\" Its treatment of popular culture has since been hailed as path-breaking: the critic Jon Savage has said that one piece by Radcliffe \"laid the foundation for the next 20 years of sub-cultural theory.\""]}, {"page": "Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965\u20131968", "response": ["Jon Savage, in his history of the UK punk rock scene, England's Dreaming, cites Nuggets as a major influence on punk bands and includes it in his essential punk discography, alongside Iggy and the Stooges' Raw Power and The Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat."]}, {"page": "Unknown Pleasures", "response": ["Melody Maker called Unknown Pleasures an \"opaque manifesto\" and musically described it as \"Gary Glitter meets the Velvet Underground\".

In Rolling Stone, music journalist Mikal Gilmore described the album as having \"a doleful, deep-toned sound that often suggested an elaborate version of the Velvet Underground or an orderly Public Image Ltd.\" By August of that year the album's stature as a favourite of critics for the year was established.Ott, 97 Robert Palmer placed the album at fourth place in his best of 1980 list for the New York Times, proclaiming the album as an \"exceptional debut\" and that the album \"remains the group's masterpiece\" and that it was \"some of the most driven, desperate rock-and-roll ever recorded.\"", "Retrospective critical writing on the album has been virtually unanimous in its praise. In 1994, Jon Savage described the music as \"a definitive Northern Gothic statement: guilt-ridden, romantic, claustrophobic\". Analysing Curtis's work, music journalist Richard Cook remarked in 1983: \"sex has disappeared from these unknown pleasures; it is an aftermath of passion where everything's (perhaps) lost\".Cook, Richard. \"Cries & Whispers (A retrospective on the vinyl pain and pleasure of Joy Division and New Order)\".

He recruited Jon Savage (formerly of Sounds), Chris Bohn and Mary Harron to provide intellectual coverage of post-punk bands like Gang of Four, Pere Ubu, and Joy Division and of new wave in general. Vivien Goldman, previously at NME and Sounds, gave the paper much improved coverage of reggae and soul music, restoring the superior coverage of those genres that the paper had in the early 1970s. Despite this promise of a new direction for the paper, internal tension developed, principally between Williams and Coleman, by this time editor-in-chief, who wanted the paper to stick to the more \"conservative rock\" music it had continued to support during the punk era. Coleman had been insistent that the paper should \"look like The Daily Telegraph\" (renowned for its old-fashioned design), but Williams wanted the paper to look more contemporary. He commissioned an updated design, but this was rejected by Coleman.", "In 1980, after a strike which had taken the paper (along with NME) out of publication for a period, Williams left MM. Coleman promoted Michael Oldfield from the design staff to day-to-day editor, and, for a while, took it back where it had been, with news of a line-up change in Jethro Tull replacing features about Andy Warhol, Gang of Four and Factory Records on the cover. Several journalists, such as Chris Bohn and Vivien Goldman, moved to NME, while Jon Savage joined the new magazine The Face. Coleman left in 1981, the paper's design was updated, but sales and prestige were at a low ebb through the early 1980s, with NME dominant."]}, {"page": "Nick Kent", "response": ["Kent's relationship with the punk scene was strained. Already a well-known music critic and a symbol of the music industry, he was assaulted by Sid Vicious with a motorcycle chain in the 100 Club.

Despite this infamous incident, Vicious claimed in a 1977 interview that Kent was 'good fun' and that 'he bought me a meal a little while ago, it was really nice of him'. In the film Sid & Nancy, there is a scene where \"Dick Bent,\" described by Pistols follower Brenda Windzor (Kathy Burke) as \"a wanky journalist who doesn't appreciate the Pistols,\" is assaulted by Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) at one of their gigs."]}, {"page": "Hunky Dory", "response": ["The final tribute song on the album, \"Queen Bitch\" is largely inspired by the rock band the Velvet Underground, specifically their lead singer Lou Reed. The handwritten sleeve notes on the back cover read: \"some V.U. White Light returned with thanks\". The song is described by Jon Savage of The Guardian as glam rock and by Joe Lynch of Billboard as proto-punk. Unlike the majority of the album's tracks, \"Queen Bitch\" is primarily driven by guitar rather than piano. The chorus sings about Bowie mincing his \"satin and tat\" as a reference to dancer Lindsay Kemp. Pegg states: \"Part of the genius of 'Queen Bitch' is that it filters the archness of Marc Bolan and Kemp through the streetwise attitude of Reed: this is a song that succeeds in making the phrase 'bipperty-bopperty hat' sound raunchy and cool.\" Daryl Easlea of BBC Music writes that the song's glam rock sound foreshadowed the direction Bowie was going to take on Ziggy Stardust."]}, {"page": "Be Here Now (album)", "response": ["According to co-producer Owen Morris, the recording sessions were marred by arguments between the band members and drug abuse, and the band's only motivations were commercial. While initial reception for Be Here Now was overwhelmingly positive, retrospective reviews of the album have been more negative, with many calling it bloated and over-produced. The band members have had differing views of the album, with Noel severely criticising it and Liam Gallagher highly praising it and even declaring it as his favourite Oasis album in a 2017 interview. Critic Jon Savage would later pinpoint the album as the end of the Britpop movement. In 2016, the album was reissued with bonus tracks, including a new remix of \"D'You Know What I Mean?\".", "In the 2003 John Dower-directed documentary Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where the Britpop movement ended.

Passion Pictures, 2004. Q expressed similar sentiments, writing, \"So colossally did Be Here Now fall short of expectations that it killed Britpop and ushered in an era of more ambitious, less overblown music.\" Irish Times journalist Brian Boyd wrote: \"Bloated and over-heated (much like the band themselves at the time), the album has all that dreadful braggadocio that is so characteristic of a cocaine user.\" Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland said: \"The fact that nothing could have lived up to the fevered expectations that surrounded its release doesn't change the facts. The third Oasis album is a loud, lumbering noise signifying nothing.\" When reviewing in 2016, Lukowski wrote that although Oasis as a band would continue, Oasis as a legend died with Be Here Now. He further states that while other Britpop bands such as Pulp and Blur moved on from the genre, Oasis continued attempting to revisit the success of their first two albums, effectively becoming a \"nostalgia act\" after 1997."]}, {"page": "Raggare", "response": ["Later, raggare often got into fights with hippies and punks,Arbetaren: Raggaren lever \u00e4nEngland's dreaming: les Sex Pistols et le punk by Jon Savage, Denys Ridrimont, p. 435Aftonbladet: Raggare r\u00f6vade bort punkare Dala Demokraten: F\u00f6rf\u00f6ljelserna mot oss h\u00e5rdnar Vermlands Folkblad: Vi t\u00f6rs inte g\u00e5 ut p\u00e5 kv\u00e4llarna  something described in the punk rock song \"Raggare Is a Bunch of Motherfuckers\" by Rude KidsThe Guardian: Raggare: the Swedish rock'n'roll cult comes of age (and later re-recorded by Turbonegro).
