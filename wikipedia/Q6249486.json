After both openers were dismissed inside the first 75 minutes, number three John Morris shared century partnerships with Stewart Hutton (61) and Phil Bainbridge (67). Morris was dismissed early on the second day but his innings of 204 was the highest by a Durham player at the time, it was also his first century for Durham since moving from Derbyshire.

Kim Barnett was captain for his seventh  season. With dry conditions, the reduced size of the seam on the cricket ball and the extension of four-day cricket, the 1990 English cricket season was batsmen-friendly allowing them to build huge scores. Kim Barnett scored five centuries in the first class game and two in one-day events to make him top scorer. John Morris scored six centuries in first class and one in the one day game, and in both matches against Yorkshire three Derbyshire players made centuries. Ian Bishop took most wickets in the first class game at 59. Derbyshire had six wins in the championship but ended twelfth as on several occasions Barnett chose to make a (losing) game of it rather than playing for a draw. He declared against New Zealand on 30 for no wicket, declared at 250 behind against Leicestershire and chose not to play a second innings against Warkwickshire. This emphasis on a faster game paid dividends in the Refuge Assurance League when Derbyshire won twelve matches to win the league for the first time. However they left both the Benson & Hedges Cup and the NWB Trophy in the early stages. Two Derbyshire records were set in the one day competitions.
