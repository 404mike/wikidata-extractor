In the first two episodes the time traveller the First Doctor (William Hartnell) and his travelling companions Steven Taylor (Peter Purves) and Dodo Chaplet (Jackie Lane) arrive on a generation ship that Dodo names \"the Ark\". The Doctor searches for a cure for a fever that has spread across the human and Monoid races on board the ship, who have no immunity to it. The last two episodes are set 700 years later, and involve the Doctor, Steven and Dodo working with the Refusian race to stop the Monoids from wiping out the last of humanity with a bomb.\nThe story constitutes Dodo's first journey as a companion to the Doctor. It is also the earliest serial of the third season to exist in its entirety.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Erickson (screenwriter)", "response": ["He was briefly married to Lesley Scott, who received screen credit for co-writing The Ark."]}, {"page": "List of Doctor Who writers", "response": ["| Although Lesley Scott is the first woman to be credited as a writer on a Doctor Who story, Clegg is the first woman to actually write a story for the program.", "| Shares writing credit on this story with Lesley Scott."]}, {"page": "Lesley", "response": ["* Lesley Scott, contributing writer to Doctor Who"]}, {"page": "Leslie Scott", "response": ["* Lesley Scott, screenwriter"]}]}}
