His only loss of the night was finishing second to England's Kenny Carter when he only needed to finish third to clinch the title.

A capacity crowd at the 1985 World Final saw a titanic fight between Denmark's defending World Champion Erik Gundersen, his fellow countryman Hans Nielsen, and American rider Sam Ermolenko. The trio all finished the meeting on 13 points each which saw a three-way runoff for the top 3 placings with Gundersen winning from Nielsen and Ermolenko.

While lining up for the start of Heat 10 against eventual champions England, represented by 1976 World Champion Peter Collins and the highly rated Kenny Carter, Nielsen was in gate 2 and initially attempted to line up across on Carter on his inside before being forced by the official to move as he was deemed to be across the line and out of his gate. After moving he then almost broke the tapes once before coming forward again, this time actually falling over his handlebars and onto the track as he tried to stop his bike which had actually rolled over the tapes (without breaking them), leaving Australian referee Sam Bass no option but to exclude him from the race.

Billy was the form rider at the World Pairs Final, winning five of his six rides. His second last ride, against an out of form West German team (M\u00fcller and Karl Maier), saw him lead into the first turn, only to fall and cause the race to be stopped.

Ironically, earlier in the meeting Bass had allowed Collins to restart Heat 10 against Denmark's Erik Gundersen and Hans Nielsen after he had also fallen in the first turn, with video evidence suggesting that like Sanders, Collins simply misjudged the slick track and fell.
