He spent a decade as a player at City scoring 56 league goals in 269 appearances, and forged a successful partnership with Sean McCarthy for four of those seasons.

He won a series of fans' awards and nominations for the PFA teams in 1987 and 1988. He scored ten goals in 1985\u201386 and 14 more in 1986\u201387.

Hendrie was one of the key men, scoring 13 goals, but he was sent off in a 2\u20132 draw at Manchester City on 23 April 1988. His subsequent suspension meant he missed the final league game of the season, as City lost 3\u20132 to Ipswich Town and missed out on promotion. It was the only league game Hendrie missed during his time at Valley Parade, and his 173 consecutive league appearances has only been beaten by Geoff Smith with City.
