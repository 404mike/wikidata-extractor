American officials allege that he has ties to al Qaeda, and have sought his extradition to the United States, which is supported by the British Government. After his internment in Broadmoor Hospital in 2008, in 2010 the European Court of Human Rights blocked efforts to extradite Aswat due to concerns over the conditions of his potential imprisonment in the United States. This decision was upheld on 11 September 2013, meaning that he can not be extradited while under treatment for paranoid schizophrenia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Broadmoor Hospital", "response": ["*Haroon Rashid Aswat, jihadist wanted by the United States."]}, {"page": "Haroon Aswat", "response": ["#REDIRECT Haroon Rashid Aswat"]}, {"page": "Oussama Kassir", "response": ["Kassir was arrested in Prague, Czech Republic, while on his way to Beirut, on December 11, 2005, on a warrant filed by United States federal prosecutors.
