For instance, Gilbert noted in an interview that the fact that the female singers to be engaged for The Mikado, Leonora Braham, Bond, and Sybil Grey, were all of short stature inspired him to make them schoolgirls\u2014three \"little\" maids\u2014and to treat them as a closely linked trio throughout the work as much as possible.
