In 1932 Tait was made the Senior Air Advisor on the British Military Mission in Egypt. At the same time or not long afterwards he was seconded to the Egyptian Army Air Force which he effectively founded, flying eight aircraft to Cario. The Egyptian monarch, King Fuad, was impressed with Tait and granted him the rank of kaimachan (lieutenant colonel) and, in 1937, King Farouk made him a Commander of the Order of the Nile. In 1937 the Egyptian Army Air Force was transferred from British to Egyptian control and the last British Sirdar, Major General Sir Charlton Spinks instructed Tait to relinquish his position. Tait responded by stating that he now only took orders from the Egyptian minister of war and after a meeting with the minister was convened, Tait was made air advisor to the EAAF (a position created especially for him) and promoted to group captain."]}, {"page": "Dorothy Brooke", "response": ["Brooke had the services of a Buying Committee.
