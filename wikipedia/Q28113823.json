This was later replaced with the George Cross.Gregson served aboard the MV Deucalion as part of Operation Pedestal, a British operation to carry supplies to the island of Malta in August 1942. On the morning of 12 August Deucalion and other elements of the convoy came under attack off the Tunisian coast.An account of the Deucalion attack, and notice of Gregson's Albert Medal award was published in the London Gazette on 2 February 1943.\u2014\n\nThe KING has been graciously pleased to make the following award:-\nThe Albert Medal.\nJohn Sedgwick Gregson, Apprentice.\nThe ship was set on fire by the explosion of a torpedo during an attack by enemy aircraft. The flames spread rapidly and almost immediately orders were given to abandon ship. One of the ship's gunners, however, was pinned under a raft. Apprentice Gregson immediately went to his assistance and, with help freed him. The gunner had sustained severe injuries and, as it was impossible to get him into a boat or on to a raft, he was dropped overboard. Gregson dived into the sea after him, and, in the darkness, towed his helpless shipmate to a ship which picked them up, a distance of about 600 yards.\n\nBut for Apprentice Gregson's gallant and determined action, undertaken with complete disregard of his personal safety, the injured man would have had little chance of survival.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Gregson (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Gregson (1919\u20131975) was an English actor", "John Gregson may also refer to:", "*John Gregson (politician) (1821\u20131867), member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly and the Tasmanian Legislative Council ", "*John Gregson, Baron Gregson (1924\u20132009),  British politician, member of the Labour Party", "*John Gregson (sailor) (1924\u20132016), British George Cross recipient", "*John Gregson (footballer) (born 1939), English winger who played from the mid 1950s to 1971"]}, {"page": "2016 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 25 December \u2013 John Gregson, George Cross recipient (born 1924)"]}, {"page": "John Sedgwick Gregson", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Gregson (sailor)"]}, {"page": "John Gregson (GC)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Gregson (sailor)"]}]}}
