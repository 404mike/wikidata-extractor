Hodgkinson was taken aback by Dr Bancroft's assessment of pituri's toxicity, and said it was as benign as tobacco:  Bancroft took Hodgkinson's samples to Britain and France where English researchers concluded the plant \"is more closely allied to tobacco\" and a Parisian chemist identified the active constituent as nicotine. This surprised Bancroft who had compared his extract from the first batch of pituri to nicotine and found the pituri extract to be much more toxic than nicotine, a finding confirmed in 1880 in experiments performed by Liversidge in Sydney on some new Duboisia hopwoodii specimens, and supported by an 1882 report that described Aboriginal hunters in central Australia steeping the leaves of Duboisia hopwoodii in waterholes to stupefy prey that drink the water, and other reports describing cattle, sheep and camels which ate it dying. Yet, when Liversidge sent more samples from yet another batch of Duboisia hopwoodii to England for analysis in 1890 the researchers replied, \"there was no obvious difference between its action and that of nicotin[e].\" "]}, {"page": "Hodgkinson", "response": ["*William Hodgkinson, Australian explorer, journalist, gold miner, and politician", "*William Hodgkinson (footballer), Welsh footballer, brother of Bert Hodgkinson"]}, {"page": "Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1888\u20131893", "response": ["|| William Hodgkinson || Liberal/Opp. || Warrego || 1873\u20131875; 1888\u20131893"]}, {"page": "Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1873\u20131878", "response": ["|| William Hodgkinson || Burke || 1873\u20131875; 1888\u20131893", ": On 13 September 1875, William Hodgkinson, member for Burke, resigned.
