Apart from eleven years as a master at Eton College between 1914 and 1925 his career was entirely at Trinity College, Cambridge.\nAt Trinity, Gow was a colleague and friend of A. E. Housman, on whose works he became an authority. The two men shared a sharp-tongued scholarly intolerance of anything they saw as slipshod, pretentious or badly thought-through, but Gow nonetheless won the affection of many of his students. He was Housman's literary executor, and published a book about his friend shortly after Housman's death.\nGow's principal subject as a scholar was the Greek bucolic poet Theocritus, his works on whom remain a core source for modern students of the poet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A.

Gow quoted examples of these attacks, noting that they \"were often savage in the extreme\".Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 24 Gow also related how Housman intimidated students, sometimes reducing the women to tears. According to Gow, Housman could never remember the names of female students, maintaining that \"had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension\". Among the more notable students at his Cambridge lectures was Enoch Powell,Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 18 one of whose own Classical emendations was later complimented by Housman.The Letters of A. E.
