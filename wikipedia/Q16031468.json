His best-known works \u2013 the short stories \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Rip Van Winkle\" \u2013 were both written in Birmingham, as was his first and best-known novel Bracebridge Hall of 1821, whose setting was loosely based on Birmingham's Aston Hall. Many of his later works, including Tales of the Alhambra and Mahomet and His Successors, were completed in Birmingham after being drafted on his wider European travels. Thomas Adolphus Trollope worked as a schoolteacher in Birmingham before establishing himself as a successful novelist, journalist and travel writer and moving to Florence in Italy, where his house became a magnet for British literary figures such as Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Isabella Varley Banks was born in Manchester and is best known for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man, but her career as a novelist started only after she moved to Birmingham in 1846 after marrying local journalist, poet and playwright George Linnaeus Banks. Her twelve novels were set in a variety of locations including Birmingham, Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Durham, Chester, and Manchester; each book being particularly notable for its faithful reproduction of local dialect and pronunciation. West Bromwich-born David Christie Murray received his training as a writer as a journalist under George Dawson on the Birmingham Daily Post. Several of his novels were set in Birmingham including A Rising Star of 1894 \u2013 the story of a Birmingham reporter with literary aspirations \u2013 with many more set in surrounding areas such as the Black Country and Cannock Chase."]}, {"page": "Alfred Egmont Hake", "response": ["Hake also collaborated with David Christie Murray on novels.
