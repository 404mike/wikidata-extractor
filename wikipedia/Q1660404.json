Dismorr participated in almost all of the avant-garde groups active in London between 1912 and 1937 and was one of the few English painters of the 1930s to work in a completely abstract manner. She was one of only two women members of the Vorticist movement and also exhibited with the Allied Artists Association, the Seven and Five Society and the London Group. She was the only female contributor to Group X and displayed abstract works at the 1937 Artists' International Association exhibition. Poems and illustrations by Dismorr appeared in several avant-garde publications including Blast, Rhythm and an edition of Axis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vorticism", "response": ["Lewis's Vorticist manifesto was to be published in a new literary and art journal, BLAST \u2013 ironically, the journal's title had been suggested by Nevinson, who was now persona non grata since the 'Vital English Art' manifesto.

Two women artists, Helen Saunders and Jessica Dismorr, who had turned to 'cubist works' in 1913, joined the rebels \u2013 and, although they were not regarded highly by the men, Brigid Peppin argues that Saunders's 'juxtapositions of strong and unexpected colour' may have influenced Lewis's later use of forceful colour.Brigid Peppin, 'Women That a Movement Forgot', Tate, Etc.  22 (summer 2011), p. 35.", "thumb|200x200px|left|Abstract Composition is indicative of Jessica Dismorr's work at the time of the Vorticist Exhibition, 1915", "Compared with BLAST No. 1 this was a scaled-back production \u2013 102 pages, rather than the 158 pages of the first issue and with simple black-and-white \u2018line block\u2019 illustrations.

Lewis's rhetoric was more cautious this time \u2013 trying to avoid being seen by the readership as unpatriotic.
