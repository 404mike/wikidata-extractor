During his managerial career, Livingstone took charge of the Republic of Ireland from 1951 to 1953, before managing Belgium, guiding them to the 1954 FIFA World Cup and notably was in charge for the thrilling 4\u20134 draw with England in the group stages.After success with Belgium he moved on to manage Newcastle United in 1954. Some supporters and staff were at first concerned that his tactics were in total contrast to those of his predecessor George Martin, but these doubts were laid to rest when he guided the team to FA Cup victory in 1955. The Newcastle board had the final say in which players would be playing during his spell at the club and they notably played Jackie Milburn for this final, against Livingstone's wishes. Milburn coincidentally scored in the match.It was largely believed that Livingstone was unhappy with the amount of influence the board had on first team issues (although he never stated this). He left Newcastle in 1956 and went on to manage Fulham between 1956 and 1958 and then Chesterfield until 1962.", "link_mentions": {}}}
