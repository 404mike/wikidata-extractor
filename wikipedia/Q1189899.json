During his managerial career, Livingstone took charge of the Republic of Ireland from 1951 to 1953, before managing Belgium, guiding them to the 1954 FIFA World Cup and notably was in charge for the thrilling 4\u20134 draw with England in the group stages.After success with Belgium he moved on to manage Newcastle United in 1954. Some supporters and staff were at first concerned that his tactics were in total contrast to those of his predecessor George Martin, but these doubts were laid to rest when he guided the team to FA Cup victory in 1955. The Newcastle board had the final say in which players would be playing during his spell at the club and they notably played Jackie Milburn for this final, against Livingstone's wishes. Milburn coincidentally scored in the match.It was largely believed that Livingstone was unhappy with the amount of influence the board had on first team issues (although he never stated this). He left Newcastle in 1956 and went on to manage Fulham between 1956 and 1958 and then Chesterfield until 1962.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["|| Doug Livingstone"]}, {"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["Banks was given his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, at the expense of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2\u20132, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the following match; by the end of the 1958\u201359 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coach to guide him, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for \u00a37,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to \u00a315 a week."]}, {"page": "Sparta Rotterdam", "response": ["*Doug Livingstone (1949)"]}, {"page": "Belgium national football team", "response": ["Rather than developing innovative team formations or styles of play, Belgium's managers applied conventional tactics. At the three 1930s World Cups, the Red Devils were aligned in a contemporary 2\u20133\u20135 \"pyramid\". In 1954, Doug Livingstone's squad played in a 3\u20132\u20135 \"WM\" arrangement during World Cup matches. Throughout most of their tournament matches in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, the team played in a 4\u20134\u20132 formation. Since Raymond Goethals' stint in the 1970s, a key strength of the Belgian squad has been their systematic use of the offside trap, a defensive tactic that was already intensively applied in the 1960s by Anderlecht coach Pierre Sinibaldi. According to football journalist Wim De Bock, \"master tactician\" Goethals represented the \"conservative, defensive football of the Belgian national team\"; he added that in the 1970s, the contrast between the Belgian playing style and the Total Football of their Dutch rivals \"could not be bigger\"."]}]}}
