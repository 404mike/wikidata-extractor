He played as a midfielder for Manchester United, and helped the club win the FA Cup in 1948 with a goal against Blackpool in the final, a match that still widely accepted as one of the finest games ever played at Wembley Stadium. Manchester United won 4-2 and this was the first of Stanley Matthews' three cup final appearances for Blackpool. Anderson was transferred to Nottingham Forest in October 1949 before transferring to Peterborough United where upon retiring from playing professional football he was recruited to Posh's backroom staff as trainer/coach. His first-born son John Anderson and family still live in Peterborough although his other siblings all relocated in Manchester.\nHe died in August 2006, two months before what would have been his 85th birthday.", "link_mentions": {}}}
