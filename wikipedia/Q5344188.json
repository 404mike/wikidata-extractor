His early output of serialised fiction brought Sweeney Todd, a gentleman vampire, and many romantic heroes to a new public \u2013 those without reading material that they could both afford to buy and enjoy reading. His hugely popular penny dreadful serials earned him the means to move into newspapers.Moving away from fiction in the 1850s, his Sunday title, Lloyd\u2019s Weekly, was the first newspaper to reach a million circulation. He later created the Daily Chronicle, renowned for the breadth of its news coverage. It grew in political influence until bought out in 1918 by Prime Minister David Lloyd George.\nLloyd's enthusiasm for industrial processes and technical innovation gave him an unbeatable competitive edge. In 1856, he set a new standard for Fleet Street\u2019s efficiency by introducing Hoe\u2019s rotary press. A few years later, when taking the unusual step of making his own newsprint, he revolutionised the paper trade by harvesting vast crops of esparto grass in Algeria. Lloyd was the only nineteenth century newspaper proprietor to take control of his entire supply chain, i.e. achieve full vertical integration.\nProfessor Rohan McWilliam of Anglia Ruskin University believes Lloyd to be a key figure who shaped popular culture, in terms of the press and popular fiction, stating \u201che was a key figure in the emergence of newspapers and popular culture in Britain\u201d.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Dickens", "response": ["Dickens was the most popular novelist of his time,. and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors.

Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime and, as early as 1913, a silent film of The Pickwick Papers was made.

The first \u2018sighting\u2019 of him was in 1837, and he was described as having a terrifying and frightful appearance, with diabolical physiognomy, clawed hands and eyes that \u2018resembled red balls of fire\u2019.

At the height of Spring-Heeled Jack hysteria, several women reported being attacked by a clawed monster of a man breathing blue flames. The last \u2018sighting\u2019 was in Liverpool in 1904. In 1838, Robin Hood featured in a series of penny dreadfuls titled Robin Hood and Little John: or, The Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, which sparked the beginning of the mass circulation of Robin stories.
