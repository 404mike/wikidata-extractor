The name Gurdjieff represents a Russified form of the Pontic Greek surname \"Georgiades\" (). Greek-Georgian were also very common combinations in Kars Oblast and Georgia under Tsarist rule, The Caucasus Greeks of Kars Oblast were generally regarded as Russianized eastern Pontic Greeks and lived in areas and villages with large indigenous Armenian populations, which explains the variant spellings of the surname of Gurdjieff's father and the fact that like many in the Kars region he was of mixed Greek and Armenian parentage. Greek-Russian and Greek-Georgian were also very common combinations in Kars Oblast and Georgia under the Tsarist rule. which is also a possible root of his surname, as Muslims around Georgia call the Georgian people \"Gurdji\" (with Russified ending -eff). The exact year of his birth remains unknown; conjectures range from 1866 to 1877. Some authors (such as James Moore) argue for 1866. Both Olga de Hartmann, the woman Gurdjieff called \"the first friend of my inner life\", and Louise Goepfert March, Gurdjieff's secretary in the early 1930s, believed that Gurdjieff was born in 1872. A passport gave a birthdate of November 28, 1877, but he once stated that he was born at the stroke of midnight at the beginning of New Year's Day (Julian calendar). Although the dates of his birth vary, the year of 1872 is inscribed in a plate on the gravemarker in the cemetery of Avon, Seine-et-Marne, France, where his body was buried.", "During this period, Gurdjieff acquired notoriety as \"the man who killed Katherine Mansfield\" after Katherine Mansfield died there of tuberculosis under his care on 9 January 1923. However, James Moore and OuspenskyOuspensky, In search of the Miraculous, chapter XVIII, p. 392 argue that Mansfield knew she would soon die and that Gurdjieff made her last days happy and fulfilling.", "Gurdjieff died at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.

Sympathizers regard him as a charismatic master who brought new knowledge into Western culture, a psychology and cosmology that enable insights beyond those provided by established science. At the other end of the spectrum, some critics assert he was a charlatan with a large ego and a constant need for self-glorification.Michael Waldberg (1990).

First published in Religion Today magazine (1986). Gurdjieffian student and writer John G. Bennett also claimed that \"more than anything else\", Gurdjieff was a Sufi. Though this view has been questioned \"by more orthodox followers of Gurdjieff\", it is claimed by other researchers such as William James Thompson and Anna Challenger that textual analysis of Gurdjieff's works shows references to Islamic and Sufi figures, including the Naqshbandi and the wise fool of Sufic folklore, Mulla Nasrudin."]}, {"page": "Idries Shah", "response": ["Along with the Coombe Springs property, Bennett also handed the care of his body of pupils to Shah, comprising some 300 people. Shah promised he would integrate all those who were suitable; about half of their number found a place in Shah's work. Some 20 years later, the Gurdjieffian author James Moore suggested that Bennett had been duped by Shah. Bennett gave an account of the matter himself in his autobiography (1974); he said that Shah's behaviour after the transfer of the property was \"hard to bear\", but also insisted that Shah was a \"man of exquisite manners and delicate sensibilities\" and considered that Shah might have adopted his behaviour deliberately, \"to make sure that all bonds with Coombe Springs were severed\". He added that Langton Green was a far more suitable place for Shah's work than Coombe Springs could have been and said he felt no sadness that Coombe Springs lost its identity; he concluded his account of the matter by stating that he had \"gained freedom\" through his contact with Shah, and had learned \"to love people whom [he] could not understand\". Chapter 27, Service and Sacrifice: \"The period from 1960 (...) to 1967 when I was once again entirely on my own was of the greatest value to me. I had learned to serve and to sacrifice and I knew that I was free from attachments. It happened about the end of the time that I went on business to America and met with Madame de Salzmann in New York. She was very curious about Idries Shah and asked what I had gained from my contact with him. I replied: \"Freedom!\"... Not only had I gained freedom, but I had come to love people whom I could not understand.\"", "A hostile critic was James Moore, a Gurdjieffian who disagreed with Shah's assertion that Gurdjieff's teaching was essentially sufic in nature and took exception to the publication of a chronologically impossible, pseudonymous book on the matter (The Teachers of Gurdjieff by Rafael Lefort) that was linked to Shah. In a 1986 article in Religion Today (now the Journal of Contemporary Religion), Moore covered the Bennett and Graves controversies and noted that Shah was surrounded by a \"nimbus of exorbitant adulation: an adulation he himself has fanned\". He described Shah as supported by a \"coterie of serviceable journalists, editors, critics, animators, broadcasters, and travel writers, which gamely choruses Shah's praise\". Moore questioned Shah's purported Sufi heritage and upbringing and deplored the body of pseudonymous \"Shah-school\" writings from such authors as \"Omar Michael Burke PhD\" and \"Hadrat B. M.
