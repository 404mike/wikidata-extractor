The album gained critical acclaim from The Guardian, labelling the album \"astonishing\" and NME, who described him as \"a Nick Drake for the 21st Century\". In November that year, Wilde and his band were invited to BBC 6 Music to do a live session for DJ Marc Riley, and in January 2014 aired a new live session on Huw Stephens'  BBC Radio 1 show.\nWilde quickly released his second album Red Tide Opal in the Loose End Womb in May 2014, again gaining strong critical acclaim, and significant breakthroughs on BBC 6 Music including 'Album of the Day' and playlists for 'Play & Be Saved' and 'Stomach Full Of Cats'.
