He was a lawyer by profession. He played in one first-class cricket match for Somerset in the 1905 season.\nAn amateur who batted in the lower order, Trestrail was picked for the Somerset match against Lancashire at Taunton. After Lancashire had made 401 on the first day, he made 4 and then 3 as Somerset were beaten by an innings. He was one of three Somerset debutants in the match; for one of the others, Ernest Shorrocks, this was also the only first-class match. The third, John Harcombe played six further matches for Somerset up to 1919.\nAt the December 1910 United Kingdom general election, Trestrail stood unsuccessfully for the Liberal Party in Tiverton.   He served in World War I, achieving the rank of major, and this changed his political outlook.  He wrote to Arthur Henderson offering his services to the Labour Party, and was adopted as its candidate for Torquay.  He stood there in the 1918 United Kingdom general election, but was not elected.Following the war, Trestrail joined a law firm in Huddersfield, lived in Kirkburton, and was the moving spirit behind the building of the Woodsome Hall Golf Club.", "link_mentions": {}}}
