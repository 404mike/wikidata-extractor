The term was initially used as an insult by newspapers, but it was quickly embraced and used as a term of pride by the labelled communities.Davies (2008), pg 468. In the case of the Vale of Leven, the area was reliant on the dyeing industry, and after high unemployment during the 1920s and 1930s the people of the area turned to radical socialist and communist views. This resulted in the Vale of Leven District Council becoming the first local council in Great Britain to see the Communists becoming the single largest group of representatives. Chopwell and Maerdy have a more similar history, with both areas once housing coal mining industries. Chopwell was first tagged as a 'Little Moscow' in the 1920s as a result of its strong support for the Communist Party, and still has streets in the village named after Communist Party leaders. Maerdy was also labelled on account of its socialist sympathies; the first recorded instance of its being named a 'Little Moscow' was recorded in the South Wales Daily News in 1930. The miners of Maerdy took great pride in the tag, producing several important Communist trade unionists including Arthur Horner, a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain."]}, {"page": "The Silent Village", "response": ["By August 1942, Jennings was scouting for a filming location in a mining community with both a physical resemblance to Lidice, and a similar social/political history. According to one of the film's actors, Jennings asked the advice of Welsh miners' leader and South Wales Miners' Federation president Arthur Horner as to a suitable location. Horner advised avoiding the coal mining valleys of the Rhondda, and instead investigate the more rural anthracite area of west Wales. Jennings' travels brought him to the town of Ystradgynlais in Brecknockshire, and in particular its self-contained community of Cwmgiedd. Jennings discussed the project with the local mine workers and their families, and found them enthusiastic for the venture. He also gained the co-operation of Arthur Horner, who felt that the proposed film would be symbolic of the unity and solidarity felt by all mining communities with the people of Lidice."]}, {"page": "David Watts Morgan", "response": ["Watts Morgan was a socialist and trade unionist, but he was also a strong anti-communist and opposed \"the local men of Moscow\", trade unionists who had embraced communism and whom he saw as extremists. In the 1929 election his main rival was well-known local Liberal Dr. R. D. Chalke, but the biggest interest came from the first communist challenger in the Rhondda, Arthur Horner.Williams (1996), p. 157 Although Watts Morgan had been unwell for the first few months of the year, he roused himself to attend the Ferndale May Day demonstration. When he discovered he was sharing the platform with Communist Party of Great Britain members, Horner, A. J. Cook and Dai Lloyd Davies, he left the stage and joined the crowd so he could heckle Horner's speech from the floor. Watts Morgan described Horner as \"the emissary of the blood-stained Comintern of Russia\u00a0... working to break down the democratic Government and Trades Union organization of this country.\" He had little cause for concern, and was re-elected to Rhondda East by a majority of almost 9,000. A smaller turnout in the 1931 election and the absence of a Liberal candidate may have led to Horner making a considerable advance against Watts Morgan in the number of votes polled,Williams (1996), p. 158 but Watts Morgans' majority remained substantial.Williams (1996), p. 159 Watts Morgan's death in 1933 forced a by-election, which was won by William Mainwaring."]}, {"page": "Mardy Colliery", "response": ["From its opening, Mardy had a reputation as a place for militants and left-wing political extremists, particularly communists. A prominent communist, Arthur Horner, was elected in absentia as a checkweighman\u2014at the time, he was serving a prison sentence for refusing to fight in the First World War. In the 1926 General Strike, its militancy led to the mineworkers' lodge being suspended from the South Wales Miners Federation, and expelled in 1930. During the period after the general strike, the South Wales Daily News first applied the term Little Moscow when describing Mardy. As a result, and with a slump in the demand for steam coal, production at Mardy did not resume until late 1927."]}]}}
