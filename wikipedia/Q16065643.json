She studied under a painter named Grenier and a watercolour artist named Jean-Baptiste Desire Troivaux. When the family relocated to Britain they lived in Cheltenham for a year before Backhouse continued her art education at Sass's Academy in London. Later Backhouse would take further lessons from William Mulready and from the engraver Edward Goodall. In April 1845 she  married the artist Henry Fleetwood Backhouse and began to raise a family while continuing to paint. In the 1860s and 1870s she visited and painted in Switzerland and Italy, often sketching women at work. Backhouse exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1846 and 1882. Between 1848 and 1885, some 80 works by Backhouse featured in Society of Women Artists exhibitions and she also showed thirty works at the Royal Society of British Artists in the same period. Many of her paintings were issued as chromolithographs by Rowney's."]}]}}
