The group was originally put together as the backing band for singer David Coverdale, who had recently left Deep Purple. Though the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout their history.", "In March 1976, singer David Coverdale left the English hard rock group Deep Purple. He had joined the band three years prior and recorded three successful albums with them. After leaving Deep Purple, Coverdale released his solo album White Snake in May 1977. His second solo album Northwinds was released in March 1978. Both combined elements of blues, soul and funk, as Coverdale had wanted to distance himself from the hard rock sound synonymous with Deep Purple. Both records featured former Snafu guitarist Micky Moody, whom Coverdale had known since the late 1960s. As Coverdale began assembling a backing band in London, Moody was the first to join. Among the other early candidates for the group were drummers Dave Holland and Cozy Powell, as well as guitarist Mel Galley. The decision to recruit a second guitarist was made at Moody's suggestion. Bernie Marsden, formerly of UFO and Paice Ashton Lord, agreed to join. Through Marsden, they were also able to recruit bassist Neil Murray, as the two had played together in Cozy Powell's Hammer. The band's initial line-up was rounded out by drummer Dave \"Duck\" Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnson, who had played together in Streetwalkers.", "The band, dubbed David Coverdale's Whitesnake, played their first show at Lincoln Technical College on 3 March 1978. Their live debut had originally been scheduled for 23 February at the Sky Bird Club in Nottingham, but the show was cancelled. Coverdale had originally wanted the group to be simply called Whitesnake, but was forced to use his own name as it still carried some clout as the former lead singer of Deep Purple. In interviews, Coverdale would jokingly state that the name \"Whitesnake\" was a euphemism for his penis, while in fact, it came from the song of the same name found on his first solo album. After completing a small UK club tour, the band adjourned to a rehearsal place in London's West End to begin writing new songs. They soon caught the attention of EMI International's Robbie Dennis, who wanted to sign the group. According to Bernie Marsden, however, his higher-ups were not ready to commit to a full album. Thus, the band entered London's Central Recorders Studio in April 1978 to record an EP. By this point, original keyboardist Brian Johnston had been replaced by Pete Solley. Martin Birch, who had worked with Coverdale during his time in Deep Purple, was chosen to produce. The resulting record, Snakebite, was released in June 1978. In Europe, the EP was combined with four tracks from Coverdale's album Northwinds to make up a full-length album. Snakebite also contained a slowed down cover of Bobby Bland's \"Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City\", which had originally been used by the band to audition bass players. While the song was only included because the group were short on songs, the track would later become a popular live staple at Whitesnake concerts, with Coverdale calling it \"the national anthem of the Whitesnake choir\", referring to the band's audience. When Snakebite reached number 61 on the UK Singles Chart, the band were duly signed to EMI proper.", "thumb|left|Whitesnake in 1981. From left to right: Micky Moody, Ian Paice, Bernie Marsden, David Coverdale, Jon Lord and Neil Murray", "thumb|upright|David Coverdale performing with Whitesnake in 1987", "After completing the Greatest Hits tour, Whitesnake were dropped by Geffen Records. Coverdale then resumed writing with Adrian Vandenberg on what was to be a solo album. Joining them in the studio were Denny Carmassi, as well as bassist Guy Pratt and keyboardist Brett Tuggle. As the record was being finished, the new higher-ups at EMI demanded it be released under the Whitesnake moniker. Coverdale objected, as he felt the record was sylistically too different from the band. Eventually a compromise was reached, and Coverdale agreed to release the album under the name \"David Coverdale & Whitesnake\". As a result of the name change, the guitars and drums on the album were brought up in the mix, something Coverdale later expressed disappointment over. Restless Heart was released on 26 March 1997 in Japan, followed by a European release on 26 May. The record reached number 34 on the UK Albums Chart. It charted in nine additional countries as well, with its highest chart position being in Sweden at number five. The single \"Too Many Tears\" only reached number 46 on the UK Singles Chart. Restless Heart didn't receive a US release, being available only as an import. Rock Hard called the album \"nice, but harmless\", and ultimately deemed it \"a mean disappointment\" as potentially the last Whitesnake album. Jerry Ewing, writing for Classic Rock, described it as a \"curio\" in the band's discography, falling somewhere between a Whitesnake album and a David Coverdale solo record. ", "In October 2002, David Coverdale announced plans to reform Whitesnake to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary in 2003. The new line-up was confirmed in December; Coverdale would be joined by drummer Tommy Aldridge, guitarists Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach, as well as bassist Marco Mendoza and keyboardist Timothy Drury. Talks had taken place between Coverdale and John Sykes about a possible reunion, but Coverdale ultimately felt that they had been their \"own bosses\" too long for a reunion to work. Sykes, meanwhile, claimed that after recommending Mendoza and Aldridge for the band (though Aldridge had already been in the band years earlier), he never heard back from Coverdale. Adrian Vandenberg was also asked to rejoin, but declined in order to spend time with his daughter and focus on his painting. He's since made numerous guest appearances at the band's concerts. On 29 January 2003, Whitesnake began a co-headlining tour of the US with the Scorpions. Afterwards, the band toured across Europe, playing several shows with Gary Moore in the UK. Whitesnake then returned to the US to take part in the Rock Never Stops Tour with Warrant, Kip Winger and Slaughter, before embarking on a Japanese tour in September. The reformation was initially planned to last only a few months, but Coverdale ultimately decided to keep the band active. No immediate plans were put in place for a new studio album, with Coverdale citing his dissatisfaction with the music industry as a contributing factor.", "David Coverdale's original vision for Whitesnake was to create a blues-based, melodic hard rock band with soul. He wanted to combine elements of hard rock, R&B and blues with \"good commercial hooks\". Coverdale's earliest influences included The Pretty Things and The Yardbirds, who combined blues and soul with electrified rock, a style Coverdale found more appealing to traditional twelve-bar blues structures. Another major influence on Whitesnake's sound was The Allman Brothers Band, particularly their first album. Whitesnake's other early influences included Cream, Mountain, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green, Jeff Beck (particularly the albums Truth and Beck-Ola), Paul Butterfield, and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers (particularly The Beano Album) As the band began playing and writing together, their sound developed further into what has been described by music critics as their blues rock period, which encompasses roughly the first five Whitesnake studio albums. Rolling Stones Richard Bienstock described their early sound as \"bloozy, sexed-up pub-rock\". Micky Moody and Neil Murray have felt that Whitesnake didn't truly find their sound until Ready an' Willing. Coverdale has seconded this, stating that Ready an' Willing was the beginning of what Whitesnake should have sounded like from the start.", "As Whitesnake's style evolved in the mid to late 1980s, they began to draw unfavourable comparisons to Led Zeppelin. Tracks like \"Slow an' Easy\", \"Still of the Night\" and \"Judgement Day\" have been accused of copying Led Zeppelin, while David Coverdale has been accused of imitating singer Robert Plant. This comparison was exacerbated when Coverdale teamed up with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page to release the album Coverdale\u2013Page in 1993. In the press, Plant would refer to Coverdale as \"David Cover-version\". Coverdale denied any notion of plagiarism, stating: \"I don't know how accurate the comparison is. People shouldn't forget that I worked in Deep Purple for a number of years, so my pedigree in hard rock is quite strong. I understand that bands like Whitesnake, Purple and Led Zeppelin all play a solid powerful brand of rock, but I don't think we're coming from the same place musically.\" Neil Murray laid some of the blame on John Kalodner, who he claimed began pushing Whitesnake in a more Led Zeppelin-like direction.", "*David Coverdale \u2013 lead vocals (1978\u20131990, 1994, 1997, 2003\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Ronnie James Dio", "response": ["In 1974, Dio sang on the Roger Glover conducted and produced concept album The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast.
