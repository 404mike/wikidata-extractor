From early 1971, he opposed, with increasing vehemence, Heath's approach to Northern Ireland, the greatest breach with his party coming over the imposition of direct rule in 1972. He strongly believed that it would survive only if the Unionists strove to integrate completely with the United Kingdom by abandoning devolved rule in Northern Ireland. He refused to join the Orange Order, the first Ulster Unionist MP at Westminster never to be a member (and, to date, one of only four, the others being Ken Maginnis, Danny Kinahan and Sylvia Hermon), and he was an outspoken opponent of the more extremist loyalism espoused by Ian Paisley and his supporters."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "Baron Maginnis of Drumglass", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "Lord Maginnis of Drumglass", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Maginnis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Wiggins Maginnis, Baron Maginnis of Drumglass", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland peace process", "response": ["*Recordings of College Historical Society debate on the Peace Process featuring John Hume, Jeffrey Donaldson, David Burnside and Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "Stranmillis University College", "response": ["* Ken Maginnis; former MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1979\u20132010)", "response": ["|Ken Maginnis", "|Ken Maginnis"]}, {"page": "Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The ensuing by-election took place amidst the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike.
