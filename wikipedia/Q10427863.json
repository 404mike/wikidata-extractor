Richardson and Teddy Sandford all having notched over 20 League goals for the season. The two teams had actually met in a League game five days earlier on Easter Monday and drawn 1\u20131 at The Hawthorns. Wednesday went into the match with a full strength squad and fielded the same starting eleven that they had for every round except the third, Ellis Rimmer was their ace in the pack having scored in every round up to the final. West Brom brought back Joe Carter into the team having been absent with a knee injury since the semi-final. Harry Jones being the unlucky player to miss out. In hindsight the decision to play Carter was clearly a gamble and a mistake with no substitutes allowed. Carter was limping after only ten minutes of the match and missed two second half chances which he may have taken if he had been fully fit. Another controversial move by West Brom was the decision to leave out Arthur Gale who had played in all six FA Cup ties leading up to the final that season, scoring four goals from the right wing. Gale was replaced by Tommy Glidden who was effectively shackled by Wednesday's left back Ted Catlin."]}, {"page": "Harry Jones", "response": ["Harry Jones may refer to:", "*Harry Jones (footballer, born 1891) (1891\u20131947), English international football player", "*Harry Jones (footballer, born 1911) (1911\u20131957), English football player ", "*Harry Jones (Welsh footballer) (fl. 1911\u20131915), Welsh football player for Port Vale", "*Harry Jones (rugby union, born 1878) (1878\u20131930), Welsh international rugby union player", "*Harry Jones (rugby union, born 1989), Canadian international rugby union player", "*Harry Jones (rugby union, born 1992), New Zealand rugby union player for Waikato", "*Harry Jones (rugby union, born 1995), Australian professional rugby union player for the New South Wales Waratahs", "*Harry Jones (American football) (born 1945), American football player who played for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1967 to 1970", "*Harry Jones (Australian footballer, born 1911) (1911\u20131997), Australian rules football player for Collingwood", "*Harry Jones (footballer, born 1999) (born 1999), Australian rules football player for Hawthorn", "*Harry Jones (cricketer, born 1922) (1922\u20131995), Welsh cricketer", "*Harry Jones (sailor) (1895\u20131956), Canadian sailor who competed in the 1932 Olympics", "*Harry Jones (actor), American/British actor, in Dark Towers", "*Harry Jones, a minor character in Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep", "*Harry Jones (British Army officer) (1791\u20131866), British general", "*Harry Jones (politician) (1840\u20131936), Welsh-born prospector and political figure in British Columbia", "*Harry Jones, Tracy Beaker and The Dumping Ground character"]}, {"page": "Harry Jones (footballer born 1911)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Jones (footballer, born 1911)"]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["Aston Villa played the  1938\u201339 English football season in the Football League First Division having won promotion in the previous season.Association Football, 27 August 1938, The Times The pre-season Jubilee Fund matches saw Villa pitched against local rivals West Bromwich Albion.
