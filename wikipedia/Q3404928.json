Also known as the man who never was, Martin's personal details were created to lend credence to the scheme, which involved a body, dressed as a British officer and carrying secret documents, to wash up on shores of neutral Spain, apparently the victim of an air crash. It was intended that these documents, containing information that suggested an Allied assault on Greece was planned, should fall into the hands of German intelligence.\nThe identity of the body employed as Major Martin was kept secret during and after the war, and was the source of some speculation. The body was identified in 1996 as that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh homeless man, and recognized as such by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glyndwr Michael", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Martin (Royal Marine officer)#Glyndwr Michael"]}]}}
