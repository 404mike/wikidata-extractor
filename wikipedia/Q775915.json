He became a communist and decided to work for the MGB while a prisoner during the Korean War. Discovered in 1961 and sentenced to 42 years in prison, he escaped from Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London in 1966 and fled to the Soviet Union.

After suggestions in the press that Vassall had been shielded by his political masters, the responsible minister, Thomas Galbraith, resigned from the government pending inquiries. Galbraith was later exonerated by the Radcliffe inquiry, which sent two newspaper journalists to prison for refusing to reveal their sources for sensational and uncorroborated stories about Vassall's private life.Levin, pp. 59\u201360 The imprisonment severely damaged relations between the press and the Conservative government of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan;Levin, p. 62 columnist Paul Johnson of the New Statesman warned: \"[A]ny Tory minister or MP\u00a0... who gets involved in a scandal during the next year or so must expect\u2014I regret to say\u2014the full treatment\".Davenport-Hines, p. 241, quoting Paul Johnson in the New Statesman, 22 March 1963"]}, {"page": "Cold War espionage", "response": ["|Joint US/UK (CIA/SIS) Operation Gold puts a tunnel under the frontier in occupied Berlin to tap into Soviet army communications.

The march occurred while North Korea was being over-run by United Nations forces. As North Korean forces retreated to the Yalu River on the border with China, they evacuated their prisoners with them. On 31 October 1950, some 845 prisoners, including about eighty noncombatants, left Manpo and went upriver, arriving in Chunggang on 8 November 1950. A year later, fewer than 300 of the prisoners were still alive. The march was named after the brutal North Korean colonel who presided over it, his nickname was \"The Tiger\". Among the prisoners was George Blake, an MI6 officer who had been stationed in Seoul. While he was being held as a prisoner, he became a KGB double agent."]}, {"page": "Operation Gold", "response": ["The plan was activated in 1954 because of fears that the Soviets might be launching a nuclear attack at any time, having already detonated a hydrogen bomb in August 1953 as part of the Soviet atomic bomb project. Construction of the tunnel began in September 1954 and was completed in eight months. The Americans wanted to hear any warlike intentions being discussed by their military and were able to listen to telephone conversations for nearly a year, eventually recording roughly 90,000 communications. The Soviet authorities were informed about Operation Gold from the very beginning by their mole George Blake but decided not to \"discover\" the tunnel until 21 April 1956, in order to protect Blake from exposure.", "One of those who attended the early meetings was George Blake, a mole in the British intelligence apparatus. Blake apparently alerted the KGB immediately, as two of Gehlen's agents were caught trying to get a potential tapping wire across a Berlin canal. The KGB decided to let Operation Gold proceed since, in order to attack the tunnel, the Soviets would have to compromise Blake and they found it preferable to sacrifice some information rather than their valuable agent. According to the author of a 2019 book about the operation, the Soviets \"value[d] Blake so much, they fear[ed] his exposure more than they fear[ed] a breach of their secrets\"."]}, {"page": "George Kennedy Young", "response": ["Young gave his views on the role of the spy in a circular issued during the late 1950s, quoted by George Blake:"]}, {"page": "Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)", "response": ["Former Director of the SVR RF Sergei Lebedev stated \"there has not been any place on the planet where a KGB officer has not been\".

He was never to be as successful there as he had been in MI5.\"Wright, Spycatcher, p. 96 During his tenure at MI6, he rebuilt the organisations relationship with Whitehall and the CIA.
