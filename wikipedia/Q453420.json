He immediately appointed Captain William Lonsdale as Chief Agent of Government, Police Magistrate and Commandant for the Port Phillip region.  Lonsdale's Chief Agent duties were authorised in written instructions from Governor Sir Richard Bourke:   This effectively gave William Lonsdale authority that made him an unofficial \"Superintendent\".

It appears that the Governor was engaged in a power struggle with Sydney's Colonial bureaucracy, labelled the \"Exclusives\", his Colonial Secretary McLeay being a member of that group. This \"Confidential Report\" appeared necessary to ensure no one of significance gained too much prior advantage in any land development at this Port Phillip outpost. It also indicated that Captain William Lonsdale was held in high esteem by Governor Sir Richard Bourke who had personally chosen him to manage this Port Phillip settlement foundation.", "Lonsdale's salary was 300 pounds Sterling, 50 pounds being deducted whilst he drew half pay from his Regiment as Commandant of a Company of the King's Own 4th at Port Phillip.  He received a 100-pound outfitting allowance for this new appointment. The Governor, with his authority over the Royal Navy in the region, instructed Captain William Hobson and , just arrived in Port Jackson, to transport Captain William Lonsdale, his family and public officers to Port Phillip. It was important that a warship of the Imperial Navy be present to reinforce the Governor's power, now delegated to Lonsdale as General Agent of Government. Lonsdale had to establish a new remote settlement that was only accessible by sea, as no overland route existed from Sydney to Port Phillip, as southern New South Wales was a vast forest with large rivers, yet to be explored.", "Captain William Lonsdale immediately landed unofficially, distributing the official proclamation of the establishment of the new settlement and followed this up with a second informal visit the following day.", "Here Captain William Lonsdale was met by John Batman and Dr Thompson and other assembled illegal settlers, all anxious to have their land claims and investments validated.", "Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived in Melbourne in October 1839 as Port Phillip's first Superindendant and he relieved Captain William Lonsdale of his General Agent of Government duties.  The people of Melbourne marked the occasion by giving William Lonsdale an Address and financial gifts, from the settlers, including the new Superintendent.   They presented him with 325 pounds for an inscribed silver service.  Lonsdale continued to act as Police Magistrate until appointed as Sub-Treasurer of the district on a salary of 400 pounds in April 1840. His relations with Latrobe and the new Governor, Sir George Gipps, were always good.

They described newly recognized geological periods, such as the Cambrian, the Silurian, the Devonian, and the Permian. Increasingly, such progress in stratigraphy depended on the opinions of experts with specialized knowledge of particular types of fossils such as William Lonsdale (fossil corals), and John Lindley (fossil plants) who both played a role in the Devonian controversy and its resolution.Rudwick The Great Devonian Controversy p. 94 By the early 1840s much of the geologic time scale had been developed. In 1841, John Phillips formally divided the geologic column into three major eras, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, based on sharp breaks in the fossil record.Larson pp. 36\u201337 He identified the three periods of the Mesozoic era and all the periods of the Paleozoic era except the Ordovician.  His definition of the geological time scale is still used today.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils p. 213 It remained a relative time scale with no method of assigning any of the periods' absolute dates. It was understood that not only had there been an \"age of reptiles\" preceding the current \"age of mammals\", but there had been a time (during the Cambrian and the Silurian) when life had been restricted to the sea, and a time (prior to the Devonian) when invertebrates had been the largest and most complex forms of animal life."]}, {"page": "Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution", "response": ["It was in 1824 that the most robust of Bath's literary and scientific societies was founded.

H.W.H. Smythe was the brother-in-law of William Lonsdale and had previously been employed as a colonial surveyor working in regions uncharted to the British with people such as Foster Fyans. The Murray District consisted of the area between the Murray River and the Goulburn River. Smythe set up his headquarters and Border Police barracks at Benalla. In 1843 and 1844, Smythe with his troopers and a section of Native Police under Henry Dana conducted a series of punitive expeditions along the lower Goulburn River to the junction with the Murray River and up to the Edward River. A squatter recalled one particular incident where troopers of the Border Police captured and chained an Aboriginal man who was a member of a tribe that has stolen a large number of sheep and a carbine from a shepherd. They forced him to lead the force to the rest of his tribe but when the man attempted to escape he was shot dead by the troopers. The recollections also reveal how local armed squatters would participate in the raids. In 1847, an Aboriginal man by the name of \"Gentleman Jemmy\" arrested by Smythe's troopers officially voiced that his \"original rights\" to the land over-rode any laws forced upon him by the British. By the end of the decade the force in this district had become defunct. H.W.H.
