He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and after the First World War became a lecturer in Modern History and fellow of All Souls College from 1919 to 1944 and a fellow at New College from 1922 to 1939. Later he was Montague Burton Professor of International Relations (1944\u20131947) and then Professor of Modern History at Oxford. He later taught at Princeton University in the United States (1951\u20131962). His scope was impressively wide, his first publication being on the late Roman Empire whilst on sick leave from service in the First World War but his most famous works being on the First World War. He wrote The Age of Reform in the Oxford History of England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of the United Kingdom", "response": ["There was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free. Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal. There were still problem areas, such as occasional riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism. Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, which controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military. Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate. Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music. The educational system was mediocre; the capstone universities (outside Scotland) were likewise mediocre.Porter, ch 1\u20133 Historian Llewellyn Woodward has concluded:"]}, {"page": "Victorian era", "response": ["Social reforms focused on ending slavery, removing the slavery-like burdens on women and children, and reforming the police to prevent crime, rather than emphasizing the very harsh punishment of criminals.

Llewellyn Woodward argued that the high duty of corn mattered little because when British agriculture suffered from bad harvests, this was also true for foreign harvests and so the price of imported corn without the duty would not have been lower. However, the threat to British agriculture came about twenty-five years after repeal due to the development of cheaper shipping (both sail and steam), faster and thus cheaper transport by rail and steamboat, and the modernisation of agricultural machinery. The prairie farms of North America were thus able to export vast quantities of cheap grain, as were peasant farms in the Russian Empire with simpler methods but cheaper labour. Every wheat-growing country decided to increase tariffs in reaction to this, except Britain and Belgium."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Ernest Llewellyn Woodward (1890\u20131971), British history and international relations"]}, {"page": "All Souls College, Oxford", "response": ["* Llewellyn Woodward"]}, {"page": "Diplomatic history", "response": ["* Ernest Llewellyn Woodward, (1890\u20131971), British"]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Ernest Llewellyn Woodward, (1890\u20131971)"]}, {"page": "History of the Great War", "response": ["Edmonds retorted that he would ignore the criticisms as they were \"trifling or silly\", except for a request to cut a comment that Viscount D'Abernon, Ambassador to Germany (1920\u20131925) was pro-German. Edmonds pointed out that the views were his, not officially endorsed and that the official history should not be determined by the War Office, Admiralty or Foreign Office. The volume had been based on official documents and he stood by it. The source of the criticism was Charles Webster (25 July 1886 \u2013 August 1961), who had written memoranda analysing the Armistice and military occupation, ready for the anticipated re-occupation of Germany. Edmonds was most critical of one of the documents and wrote to Webster defending Haig. Obstacles were placed between him and his detractors, with the intention of protecting his feelings, because the Foreign Office harboured another critic, Llewellyn Woodward (1890\u20131971), who called the book episodic, with slurred chronology and a narrative of the controversy over provisioning the occupied territories, that was misleading; criticism of civilian authorities lacked evidence and was \"dogmatic and prejudiced\". Woodward, less critical than Webster, asked him to spare Edmonds' feelings but Webster found the book lacking in analytical rigour, refused to devote more time to it and R. A. Butler, Chairman of the Committee on the Control of Official Histories, got the job of rejecting the book for publication. In July 1944, over Edmonds' objections, it was decided to print a hundred copies For Official Use Only but only after many Foreign Office demands had been conceded, including cuts to the preface."]}, {"page": "History of the Second World War", "response": ["** Volume I, Sir Llewellyn Woodward, 1970", "** Volume II, Sir Llewellyn Woodward, 1971", "** Volume III, Sir Llewellyn Woodward, 1971", "** Volume IV, Sir Llewellyn Woodward, 1975", "** Volume V, Sir Llewellyn Woodward, 1976", "** Abridged Version, Sir Llewellyn Woodward, 1962"]}, {"page": "Oxford History of England", "response": ["*Volume XIII: The Age of Reform, 1815\u20131870 \u2014 Sir Llewellyn Woodward (1938)"]}, {"page": "List of faculty members at the Institute for Advanced Study", "response": ["| Ernest Llewellyn Woodward || historian || 1951 || 1960  || Emeritus 1961-1971"]}, {"page": "Llywelyn", "response": ["*Llewellyn Woodward (1890\u20131971), British historian"]}, {"page": "Montague Burton Professor of International Relations", "response": ["* 1944\u20131947 Sir Llewellyn Woodward"]}, {"page": "C. R. M. F. Cruttwell", "response": ["Cruttwell's professional reputation has been overshadowed by the attention given to his feud with Waugh, the true significance of which, according to Geoffrey Ellis's biographical sketch, may have been exaggerated. Cruttwell's experiences as a soldier were such that he spent his entire career writing about war, according to another biographer. \"In A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World (1937) he wracks his brains for peaceful changes that were not contingent upon war\". His standing as a military historian is largely based on his 1934 Great War history, which Ellis praises as \"most notable for its frank and fearless judgements on those identified as the principal actors (military, naval and political) in that tragic conflict\". The work was widely praised in the press at the time of publication; The Naval Review thought that its description of the Battle of Jutland was \"admirable\": \"for those who wish to gain a clear but not too detailed idea of the general course of the war, and of the relations of the different parts of it to one another, the book should be invaluable\". Against this, the Royal United Services Institute's review thought the book under-sourced and the quality of its writing poor in places. More recently, writer and broadcaster Humphrey Carpenter has criticised the book as lacking in humanity, displaying \"almost no awareness of the appalling degree of suffering it chronicles\". Nevertheless, historian Llewellyn Woodward considered it \"the most profound study of any war in modern times\", and the inspiration for his own Great War history of 1970, while strategist Colin S. Gray describes Cruttwell as \"the most balanced of the historians of that conflict\"."]}, {"page": "1952 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Professor Ernest Llewellyn Woodward , Editor of Documents on British Foreign Policy."]}, {"page": "Rohan Butler", "response": ["Butler worked on the multi-volume Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939.
