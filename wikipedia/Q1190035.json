He was Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum between 1956 and 1976. He was additionally Geddes\u2013Harrower Professor of Greek Art and Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen from 1972 to 1973, and, in retirement, visitor to the Ashmolean Museum from 1979 to 1987. He had served in military intelligence during the Second World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbert Maryon", "response": ["During 1953 and 1954, his talk and paper on the Colossus of Rhodes received international attention for suggesting the statue was hollow, and stood aside rather than astride the harbour. Made of hammered bronze plates less than a sixteenth of an inch thick, he suggested, it would have been supported by a tripod structure comprising the two legs and a hanging piece of drapery. Although \"great ideas\" according to the scholar Godefroid de Callata\u00ff, neither fully caught on; in 1957, Denys Haynes, then the Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, suggested that Maryon's theory of hammered bronze plates relied on an errant translation of a primary source. Maryon's view was nevertheless influential, likely shaping Salvador Dal\u00ed's 1954 surrealist imagining of the statue, The Colossus of Rhodes. \"Not only the pose,\" wrote de Callata\u00ff, \"but even the hammered plates of Maryon's theory find [in Dal\u00ed's painting] a clear and very powerful expression.\""]}]}}
