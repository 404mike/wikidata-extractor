The others, men, women and children, were: the second and third mates, the steward, the cabin boy, the commanding officer of the company of soldiers on board and his wife, five other officers, two privates, four wives, three children, one male passenger with his wife and two children, three female convicts, and the only male convict Major James George Semple Lisle. For provisions they were given \"three small casks of water, containing about ninety gallons, four bags of bread and three pieces of salt beef\" and managed to smuggle aboard \"two hams, two cheeses, and a small keg containing about four gallons of rum\", and for navigation a quadrant, and a small pocket compass. The Lady Shore mutineers (soldiers and sailors) then sailed away with the ship\u2019s surgeon, and 66 female convicts. The 29 castaways in the longboat hoisted sail and headed for Rio Grande, Brazil, the nearest settlement on the Portuguese coast of South America, about 300 miles away."]}]}}
