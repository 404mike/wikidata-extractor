Manhunt was re-released through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in 2013 and PlayStation 4 in 2016. Set within the fictional Carcer City, the story follows James Earl Cash, a death row prisoner who is forced to participate in a series of snuff films, earning his freedom by murdering criminal gang members sent to hunt him on camera.\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise directed at its dark, gritty tone and violent gameplay, winning several accolades and gaining a substantial cult following. Manhunt was subject to a significant video game controversy due to the level of graphic violence depicted, banned in several countries, and was implicated in a murder by the UK media, although this accusation was later rejected by the police and courts. Manhunt spawned the sequel Manhunt 2 in 2007, with new characters and a new story. As of March 2008, the Manhunt series has collectively sold 1.7 million copies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manhunt 2", "response": ["The controversy surrounding Manhunt 2 began two days after its announcement, before any footage or information on the game had been released. The initial topic of discussion was the fact that the first game had been inaccurately connected to a murder in the UK. Take-Two themselves preempted this debate, issuing a statement on 8 February, in which they said \"We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defence, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasised that Manhunt played no part in the case.\" Later that day, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah (parents of Leblanc's victim) condemned the game and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was \"astonished\" that Rockstar were making a sequel."]}, {"page": "Manhunt (video game series)", "response": ["On 28 July 2004, Manhunt was linked to the murder of Stefan Pakeerah (14) by his friend Warren Leblanc (17), in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, seizing it for evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated \"I think that I heard some of Warren's friends say that he was obsessed by this game [...] If he was obsessed by it, it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy.\" Stefan's father, Patrick, added \"they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done.\" Patrick continued \"The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops.\" During the subsequent media coverage, the game was removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of GAME and Dixons. As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a \"significantly increased\" demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites."]}, {"page": "Video game controversies", "response": ["On 27 February 2004, in Leicester, England, 17-year-old Warren Leblanc lured 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah into a park and murdered him by stabbing him repeatedly with a claw hammer and a knife. Leblanc was reportedly obsessed with Manhunt, although investigation quickly revealed that the killer did not even own a copy of the game. The victim's mother, Giselle Pakeerah, has been campaigning against violent video games in the UK ever since. The police investigating the case have dismissed any link. "]}]}}
