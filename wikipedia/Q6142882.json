Back in the line-up as Crystal Palace's first choice goalkeeper, Speroni flourished and won his reputation back. During a 1\u20130 loss against Ipswich Town on 26 August 2007, he was given a yellow card in the 43rd minute after \"handling on the edge of his box\"; after the match, the opposition team felt that Speroni should have been sent\u2013off, which manager Taylor disagreed. In a follow\u2013up match against rivals, Charlton Athletic,  Speroni was at fault when he \"rushed out to deal with a hopeful long-ball in the 74th minute - only for substitute Svetoslav Todorov to nip in and score the only goal of the game\", in a 1\u20130 loss. After the match, Taylor said he maintain his backing for Speroni, saying he will bounce back. In a match against Sheffield United on 22 September 2007, Speroni was at fault once again when he conceded two goals, in a 3\u20132 win; leading to suggestions that Taylor could re\u2013sign Iain Turner, which he denied, though the possibly was not ruled out. Following this, Speroni managed to bounce back with impressive displays and helped the club go on a fifteen matches unbeaten run between 3 November 2007 and 28 January 2008. Manager Neil Warnock also praised his performance, describing him as looking sharp and bright, which teammate Mark Hudson agreed. Towards the end of the 2007\u201308 season, he helped Crystal Palace qualify for the Championship play\u2013offs. Speroni played in both legs of the Championship play\u2013offs against Bristol City, as the club lost 4\u20132 on aggregate. At the end of the 2007\u201308 season, he was an ever present goalkeeper, playing all forty\u2013eight league matches. With his contract expiring at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, Crystal Palace began talks with Speroni over a new contract. He signed a contract extension with the club on a three-year contract, keeping him until 2011. For his performance, Speroni won the club's \"Player of the Year\" award. Reflecting on his performance in the 2007\u201308 season, Your Local Guardian said: \"Julian Speroni had a tremendous campaign, increasing his authority and presence alongside his already technically excellent game. Time after time, Speroni has kept us in matches with some fine saves and it was a relief when he sorted out his contract.\""]}, {"page": "Richard Naylor", "response": ["Born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Naylor graduated through the Ipswich Town youth academy and played for Ipswich for 14 years. He started out his Ipswich career as a robust centre forward making an instant impact in the mid-1990s for the club.
