Jones' columns as Daedalus were published for 38 years, starting weekly in 1964 in New Scientist. He then moved to the journal Nature, and continued to publish until 2002.  Columns from these magazines, along with additional comments and implementation sketches, were collected in two books: The Inventions of Daedalus:  A Compendium of Plausible Schemes (1982) and The Further Inventions of Daedalus (1999).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Space elevator", "response": ["Both the tower and cable ideas were proposed in David E.

For instance, the idea that a pot or vase could be \"read\" like a gramophone record or phonograph cylinder for messages from the past, sounds encoded into the turning clay as the pot was thrown. There is little evidence to support such ideas, and there are few publications claiming that this is the case. In comparison, the more contemporary approach to the field now has many publications and a growing significance. This earlier approach was first raised in the 6 February 1969 issue of New Scientist magazine, where it was discussed in David E. H. Jones's light-hearted \"Daedalus\" column.
