A versatile player, he was comfortable both in defence and in midfield.A former Manchester City trainee, he made his name in a six-year spell with Port Vale between 1998 and 2004, lifting the Football League Trophy in 2001. Following this he spent two years at Rochdale, also playing on loan at Northwich Victoria, before entering non-league football permanently in 2006. He then spent brief periods with Scarborough, Barrow, and Mossley. Following a couple of years with Leigh RMI, he retired from the game at Chorley in 2009, so as to concentrate on his work with the prison service.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Birchall", "response": ["Birchall attended Alleyne's High School in Stone, Staffordshire, and started his career with Port Vale, having been associated with the Burslem based club since the age of nine.

The tone of the game was set by Vale's dominant five-man midfield, with Brammer the engine that drove the \"Valiants\" search for an equaliser as Brentford struggled to keep pace. It was Brammer who made the Vale's intentions clear; sending a long-range strike goal ward, only for it to be deflected wide. Whereas Sagi Burton made the Brentford defence nervous from set pieces, misers Naylor, Brooker and Bridge-Wilkinson presented the danger from open play. On the 20 minute mark, Naylor pulled back a ball which Bridge-Wilkinson hooked wide. This was to prove their most dangerous movement of the half.", "|MF ||17 ||Neil Brisco"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Neil Brisco", "| August 1998 || MF ||  || Neil Brisco || Manchester City || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||22||align=\"left\"| Neil Brisco"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||17||align=\"left\"| Neil Brisco", "|13||MF||||17||Neil Brisco||1||0||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||7||align=\"left\"| Neil Brisco"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||7||align=\"left\"| Neil Brisco", "|\u2013||MF||||7||Neil Brisco||1||0||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the season several players left the club: Neil Brisco (Rochdale); Liam Burns (Bristol Rovers); Adrian Littlejohn (Lincoln City); and Dean Delany (Shelbourne).
