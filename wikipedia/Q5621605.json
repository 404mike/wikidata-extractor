After buying the business at Baggb\u00f6le they had large new water-powered sawmills built at Baggb\u00f6le, the first in 1842 and the second in 1850, sawmills that were the largest water powered sawmills in Sweden. The Dickson sawmills employed 170 male seasonal workers during the ice-free part of the year, from May to October, each year, from the start of operations until the company moved to a new steam powered sawmill at Holmsund, the seaport at the mouth of the Ume River from where the lumber from the sawmill was exported, in the 1880s.Baggbole , Umea.SE, retrieved 18 May 2014  Dickson also had a manor house built at Baggb\u00f6le in 1846, as residence for the local manager of the mill.

Dickson's defence was that he did not know that a large part of the logs that the sawmill was processing belonged to the Crown. The Crown was, however, said to be well aware of the fact that much of the wealth the sawmill was creating for local residents and land owners, for which the local population was very grateful, came from illegal felling of timber on Crown land. By swearing to his honesty and his lack of knowledge of what had happened Dickson was able to escape a conviction, which was allowed under Swedish law at that time, in cases where all evidence was circumstantial.The Term \"Baggb\u00f6leri\" , SkogsMuseet, retrieved 19 May 2014", "James Dickson was fortunate in avoiding a conviction, because even if he personally had been unaware of it his company was guilty of receiving stolen goods, having, every year since 1842, taken in more than the 4,500 logs per annum from Crown forests than had been agreed.Welcome to the Arboretum North!, arboretun-norr.se, retrieved 17 May 2014"]}, {"page": "James Jameson Dickson", "response": ["Dickson was born in 1815 in Gothenburg.
