He was the father of Cambridge batsmen Thomas Hayward and Daniel Hayward junior; and the grandfather of Tom Hayward, the Surrey and England opener.A right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who was mainly associated with Cambridge Town Club, Hayward made 24 known appearances in first-class matches. He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series and the North in the North v. South series.\nHe is buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge, as is his son Thomas Hayward.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ranjitsinhji", "response": ["Around this time, Ranjitsinhji began to work with Daniel Hayward, a first-class cricketer and the father of future England batsman Thomas Hayward, on his batting technique. His main fault was a tendency to back away from the ball when facing a fast bowler, making it more likely he would be dismissed. Possibly prompted by the suggestion of a professional cricketer who was bowling at him in the nets at Cambridge, he and Hayward began to practise with Ranjitsinhji's right leg tied to the ground. This affected his future batting technique and contributed to his creation of the leg glance, a shot with which he afterwards became associated. While practising, he continued to move his left leg, which was not tied, away from the ball; in this case, it moved to his right, towards point. He found he could then flick the ball behind his legs, a highly unorthodox shot and likely, for most players, to result in their dismissal. Although other players had probably played this shot before,  Ranjitsinhji was able to play it with unprecedented effectiveness. Ranjitsinhji probably developed his leg glance with Hayward around spring 1892, for during the remainder of that year, he scored around 2,000 runs in all cricket, far more than he had previously managed, making at least nine centuries, a feat he had never previously achieved in England."]}, {"page": "Thomas Hayward (cricketer)", "response": ["Hayward was from a famous cricketing family.
