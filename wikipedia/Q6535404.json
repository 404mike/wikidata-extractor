Cheney, \"Introduction\", in Levi Fox (ed.), English Historical Scholarship in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (London, 1956), p. 4. Arnaldo Momigliano in 1990 defined an antiquarian as \"the type of man who is interested in historical facts without being interested in history\".Momigliano 1990, p. 54. Professional historians still often use the term \"antiquarian\" in a pejorative sense, to refer to historical studies which seem concerned only to place on record trivial or inconsequential facts, and which fail to consider the wider implications of these, or to formulate any kind of argument. The term is also sometimes applied to the activities of amateur historians such as historical reenactors, who may have a meticulous approach to reconstructing the costumes or material culture of past eras, but who are perceived to lack much understanding of the cultural values and historical contexts of the periods in question."]}, {"page": "King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon", "response": ["There has been an educational facility at the current site of the school since at least the early thirteenth century - established by the Guild of the Holy Cross, the School can trace its origins to May 1295, when in the Register of Deacons of the Diocese of Worcester there is the record of the ordination of Richard as rector scholarum, to teach the basics of learning the alphabet, psalters, and religious rites to boys.
