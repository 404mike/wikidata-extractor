Joscelyn was involved in Parker's attempts to secure and publish medieval manuscripts on church history, and was one of the first scholars of the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) language. He also studied the early law codes of England. His Old English dictionary, although not published during his lifetime, contributed greatly to the study of that language. Many of his manuscripts and papers eventually became part of the collections of Cambridge University, Oxford University, or the British Library.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1603", "response": ["* December 28 \u2013 John Joscelyn, English clergyman and antiquarian as well as secretary to Matthew Parker (b. 1529)"]}, {"page": "Matthew Parker", "response": ["Parker published in 1567 an old Saxon Homily on the Sacrament, by \u00c6lfric of Eynsham.

In 1568 John Joscelyn, secretary to Archbishop Parker, issued a new edition of it more in conformity with manuscript authority; and in 1691 a still more carefully revised edition by Thomas Gale appeared at Oxford. It was frequently reprinted on the Continent during the 16th century, and once or twice since. The next English edition, described by August Potthast as editio pessima, was that published by the English Historical Society in 1838, and edited by the Rev. J. Stevenson. The text of Gildas founded on Gale's edition collated with two other manuscripts, with elaborate introductions, is included in the Monumenta Historica Britannica. Another edition is in Arthur West Haddan and William Stubbs, Councils and ecclesiastical documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland (Oxford, 1869); the latest edition is that by Mommsen in Monumenta Germaniae Historica auct. antiq. xiii. (Chronica min. iii.), 1898. The text as it is used today is thus a scholarly reconstruction; the prime witness and possibly the entire manuscript stemma may not actually preserve the original page order of the autograph.Rosenbaum, S. \"Evidence of Transmission Errors Affecting the Text of Gildas's De Excidio\" in Peritia Journal of the Medieval Academy of Ireland, Volume 31 (2021)"]}, {"page": "List of manuscripts in the Cotton library", "response": ["|John Joscelyn, an Old English-Latin dictionary"]}, {"page": "Hemming's Cartulary", "response": ["The only other 11th-century cartulary surviving from England is the Oswald cartulary, also compiled at Worcester.
