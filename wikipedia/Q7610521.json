They immediately began recording their self-titled major label debut in Los Angeles, with it being completed in June 1997. It was helmed by British producer Stephen Short. While the record was being prepared for release, the song \"Waterfall\" appeared in the popular 1997 slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. It was also included on the film's soundtrack album, released on October 7, 1997 by Columbia Records. On February 10, 1998, their self-titled album was finally released. It failed to attract mainstream attention, and vocalist James Grundler subsequently quit the band, with plans of launching a solo career. He would eventually instead form another Californian alternative rock band called Paloalto, who released two albums through Rick Rubin's American Recordings in the early 2000s."]}]}}
