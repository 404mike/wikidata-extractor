He played for the Wolverhampton Wolves and Plymouth Raiders in the British Basketball League (BBL).Born in Catford, London, to a Jamaican mother, Noel was educated at the Masters College in California. The 6'7 power forward returned to England in 2006 to sign with rookie professional outfit Worcester Wolves in the BBL. Despite the Wolves' dismal season, where they ended with a 4\u201332 record and a last-place finish, Noel shone through as a revelation recruit. Averaging 26.48 minutes per game, Noel posted 8.57 points and 7.96 rebounds in his first season out of college.\nHowever, it was finishing seventh in the Floor Shooting percentages table, with a tally of 54.19% that raised awareness amongst rival coaches in the league. Plymouth Raiders head coach Gary Stronach was the quickest to react and immediately signed him during the 2007 close-season. Although initially signed as a back-up forward to Raiders' 2007 MVP Gaylon Moore, Noel displayed his tough play and strong hustle whenever he got the chance and soon forced his way up the pecking-order on Raiders' deep bench.\nNoel is a published author.  He was a contributing author to the 2003 anthology, Open My Eyes, Open My Soul: Celebrating Our Common Humanity, co-created by Elodia Tate and Yolanda King, daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King.  He is also the author and creator of the Boris Basketball And Friends, a series of children's books.Noel is a professor English literature at Los Medanos College in California.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plymouth Raiders", "response": ["In summer 2009 Stronach revealed that the player's budget had been cut by 60\u201365% for the coming season, citing the economic climate and a lack of sponsorship as the main reasons for the cuts. In June 2009 Allister Gall was named the new captain. In July 2009 James Noel extended his contract. The summer saw the unveiling of a restructured development programme following a merger of Raiders development team with local club Plymouth Marjon Cannons, headed by former Cannons coach George Hatchell.", "In February it was announced that James Noel was released from his contract, due to a series of long-term injuries, allowing the team's bench players more opportunity. Form started to improve throughout the Spring, but a double loss to Glasgow and Worthing at the beginning of April ended any hopes of qualifying for the Play-offs with fives games left of the regular season. Two weeks later it was announced by the club that after 24 years of service Gary Stronach was to step down as head coach at the end of the season. Coming as a shock to many fans, Stronach cited the reason for his departure was that \"it's time for me to move on, broaden the horizon and see what's out there.\""]}, {"page": "Worcester Wolves", "response": ["With an influx of new players, including former Plymouth Raider Solomon Sheard, Caja Rioja's Sergio Rodriguez and James Noel of the Masters College all signing up for the new-look team, expectations of upsetting the big boys was high, but the fairy tale beginning never materialized. The Wolves opened the season with a 77\u201382 loss at home to Plymouth on 30 September 2006, and followed that with 21-point loss away to Milton Keynes Lions (74\u201396).
