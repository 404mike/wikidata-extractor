Spain had made the decision based on information from William Wakefield that much of the Taranaki region had been sparsely populated by M\u0101ori at the time of the purchase. The cause of the depopulation was that most of the local Te \u0100ti Awa population had either migrated to \u014ctaki or the Cook Strait region after defeat by raiding Waikato war parties in the 1820s, or been enslaved by the Waikato, but many were now returning. Spain ruled that regardless of the reason for their departure, Te \u0100ti Awa had forfeited the land and that the company purchase from the few remaining residents was valid. With tensions between settlers and M\u0101ori in Taranaki at an all-time high, and alerted by Protector of Aborigines George Clarke of problems with Spain's Taranaki ruling, FitzRoy sailed in August 1844 for New Plymouth, where he was briefed by Bishop George Selwyn and then announced he would reverse Spain's decision. Instead of the 60,000 acres in Taranaki, the company would be awarded just 3800 acres, where settlers were already located. The decision outraged settlers, who were aware of friction with returning M\u0101ori, but had been hoping the Governor would station a body of troops at New Plymouth or sanction the formation of a militia to protect their land. FitzRoy later wrote: \"It appeared so clear  ... that the view taken by the land commissioner could not be adopted by the government without causing bloodshed, and the probable ruin of the settlement; because the injustice of awarding land to the New Zealand Company, which was well known not to have been purchased by them, was apparent to every native.\" FitzRoy's decision infuriated Spain, whose resignation was then demanded by the Governor."]}, {"page": "George Selwyn", "response": ["George Selwyn  may refer to:", "*George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield) (1809\u20131878), first Bishop of New Zealand", "*George Selwyn (bishop of Tinnevelly) (1887\u20131957), Anglican colonial bishop"]}, {"page": "Waipukurau", "response": ["Within the current township is Pukekaihau hill, now in Paul Hunter Memorial Park, the site of the M\u0101ori pa, from which it gets its name.

Nevertheless, young Selwyn men produced a fine tradition of rowing from this humble boathouse, and Selwynites continued to fall in love with its ramshackle quality. The old town boathouse also produced team which achieved a second in the Lent Bumps of 1934 and third in the May Bumps 1931. An impressive result, all the more because of the facilities the rowers had to train in. The Selwyn Boat Club during this period also trained several men who would go on to become Olympic Rowers and University Blues in the annual boat race against Oxford.
