Other magazines in the category included Arena, Esquire and Men's Health.

There are proclamations of love that I\u2019ve never made before \u2013 certainly since Wham! \u2013 and then there\u2019s going further into the truth at the same time, like on \"My Mother Had A Brother\" or \"Through\" \u2013 they're trying to get closer to the truth.\""]}, {"page": "I Want Your Sex", "response": ["In a 2004 interview with Adam Mattera for UK magazine Attitude, Michael reflected: \"It was totally real.

I put her in a video. Of course she looked like a beard. It was all such a mess, really. My own confusion and then on top of that what I was prepared to let the public think.\""]}, {"page": "Attitude (magazine)", "response": ["In 2005, former editor Adam Mattera won Best Men's Magazine editor of the year at the BSME awards. It was the first time that a gay magazine editor won the prize. Mattera was short-listed again for the prize in 2006. In April 2008, Attitude's  fashion director was named in The Times as one of the UK's top 20 star-makers for his contribution to the music industry, alongside Simon Cowell. Attitude was later edited by Matthew Todd, a long-time associate editor and former deputy editor and writer of the play Blowing Whistles. Todd was nominated as Best Men's Magazine Editor of the Year at the BSME awards 2009 and 2010, the only gay magazine to have been nominated. He went on to win the award in 2011 and 2015 and won BSME Scoop of the Year in 2016 for his Prince William edition. Todd left in 2016 on publication of his book Straight Jacket: How to be gay and happy, about LGBT mental health, something he began writing about in Attitude in 2010."]}, {"page": "Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic", "response": ["After its release, Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic commented that the album \"is frighteningly similar to Prince's 1998 album, Newpower Soul\" and praised the collaborations, but stated that the effort \"is one for the dedicated, like every album he's made since he changed his name to a symbol\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said Prince's \"shtick\" was less tired than Ray Charles' after 20 years, describing the album as a lofty brand of \"generic\", \"where pro forma cameos failed to produce the hits Clive Davis banks on\". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club congratulated Prince for \"mark[ing] his return not just to major labels, but to commercial ambition and accessibility\" while Adam Mattera in Echoes called the album \"a savvy attempt to reignite his career through a series of radio-friendly missiles and superstar collaborations similar to Clive Davis' recent triumph with Santana\u2019s \"Supernatural\".\" Chris Willman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, was also impressed by the effort and praised Prince for \"trying to recapture the spirit of '99\". Wendy Hermanson from Yahoo! Music favored the record, and highlighted the singer's decision to work with other artists, particularly with Chuck D on \"Undisputed\"."]}, {"page": "Freedom! '90", "response": ["The 92-sketch storyboard called for each model to film on separate days, except for Evangelista and Turlington, who appear in a scene together. Each model was assigned a verse to lip-synch, while for the song's chorus, Fincher envisioned the three iconic items from Michael's 1987 music video \"Faith\" that had come to symbolize his public image at the time: his leather jacket, a Wurlitzer jukebox, and guitar, exploding in a ball of flame, except the leather jacket, at each occurrence of the word \"freedom\" during the chorus.  Before the chorus, the leather jacket was simply ignited and burned. Whereas \"Faith\" had opened with a jukebox phonograph needle touching a vinyl record, \"Freedom! '90\" opens with a compact disc player's laser beam reading a CD, after Evangelista turns on the CD player. In a 2004 interview with Adam Mattera for UK magazine Attitude, Michael reflected on the significance of the video's symbolism: \"By the end of the Faith tour I was so miserable because I absolutely knew that I was gay... I didn't suddenly want to come out. I wanted to do it with some kind of dignity. So I thought 'okay, you have to start deconstructing this whole image.'\""]}, {"page": "Cowboys and Angels (George Michael song)", "response": ["In a 2004 interview with Adam Mattera for UK magazine Attitude, Michael revealed the song was about a short-lived love triangle where he was in love with a man while a female friend was in love with him, but none knew of the others' feelings: \"She was in love with me because she couldn't get me, and I was in love with him because I couldn't get him... It's a very personal lyric, but it's about the ridiculousness of wanting what you can't have.\""]}, {"page": "Outside (George Michael song)", "response": ["In a 2004 interview with Adam Mattera for UK magazine Attitude, Michael reflected: \"I felt that lightening the stigma around cruising was the most immediately beneficial thing I could do.

Sounds like Al Jarreau's This Time and Steely Dan's Gaucho (minus the boring stuff!).\" Reviewing the album in Echoes, Adam Mattera singled out \"Fall In Love (I Want To)\" as \"arguably Chic's greatest production of the era - recalling both the hypnotic allure of \"I Want Your Love\" and the smooth jazz of \"Savoir Faire\", topped with a gossamer vocal from Johnny.\""]}, {"page": "Echoes (magazine)", "response": ["Adam Mattera \u2013 former staff writer, former Editor of Attitude magazine, now regular contributor."]}, {"page": "Tina (musical)", "response": ["The musical received generally positive reviews from the critics, with particular praise reserved for Adrienne Warren in the title role as Tina Turner. Michael Billington of The Guardian described the \"whirlwind performance\" of Warren as \"astonishing\", and concluded on the production: \"As bio-musicals go, this is as good as it gets.\" Similarly Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph described Warren's performance as a \"tour de force\" and considered the show \"slickly choreographed, beautifully designed and roof-raisingly well-sung\". Adam Mattera in Echoes noted \"the production plays fast and loose with catalogue chronology... it's a crowd-pleasing decision meaning all the solo mega-hits aren't squeezed into the final act, but simultaneously it derails the dramatic reveal of Tina's 80s rock'n'roll reinvention,\" while concluding \"it's so resounding joyous you don't care.\""]}, {"page": "Piano and a Microphone 1983", "response": ["The New York Times called the album \"a glimpse of a notoriously private artist doing his mysterious work\" while Adam Mattera in Echoes cited \"Mary Don't You Weep\" as \"a telling choice that points both to his political awareness and gospel heritage - not something people would have expected from a 25 year-old more famous at the time for his flasher mac, high heels and songs about incestuous siblings and used condoms\"."]}, {"page": "12 Little Spells", "response": ["Libby Cudmore of Paste added \"Musically, there is nothing constrained about her performance as a vocalist or a bassist. It\u2019s extremely organic, as though each song is unfolding right before you, rather than after laboring in a recording studio... This is not dinner jazz, but no one who picks up an Esperanza Spalding album expects it to be. Her voice and her bass are a listener\u2019s guide on a tour with no map and no destination, but where wonders abound\". Writing in Echoes, Adam Mattera singled out specific tracks for merit: \"Touch In Mine\" renders everything Solange has been retreading over her last couple of albums somewhat redundant, while in some alternate universe you could even imagine the Chic-in-outer-space groove of \"You Have To Dance\" being a hit\". John Pareles and Jon Caramanica of The New York Times listed the album as the fourth best album of the year in the publication's 28 best albums of 2018 list, stating that in spite of \"devious melodies, odd meters and cleverly interlocking patterns\", Spalding achieves complex insight with \"such breezy charm that the songs come across as lighthearted, [and] even lightheaded\"."]}, {"page": "Originals (Prince album)", "response": ["Rebecca Bengal of Pitchfork awarded the album a \"Best New Reissue\" tag and said that \"Hearing Prince sing these songs that he gave to other performers brings you close to the pulse of his artistry: transgressive, funky, sexy, a testament to his genius even in the form of demos.\" Wyndham Wallace of Classic Pop wrote that \"the slow unveiling of Prince's private recordings remains suitably seductive, if \u2013 true to form \u2013 wilfully unpredictable,\" noting that the record's \"greatest revelation is how few artists strayed far from the Prince template of these Originals.\" Adam Mattera in Echoes wrote \"fans can debate amongst themselves whether Morris Day\u2019s pimp loverboy croon tops Prince\u2019s coquettish Valentino vocal approach to the creamy slow jam \"Gigolos Get Lonely Too\", but what\u2019s in no doubt is the virtuosity of the talent that tossed out these funk diamonds and pop pearls with abandon through the 80s into the mid 90s.\""]}, {"page": "Mattera, Adam", "response": ["#redirectAdam Mattera"]}]}}
