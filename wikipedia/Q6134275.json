It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow-motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the telecine process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted from a monochromatic, grainy look at the start, to a warm, colourful and bright look at the end of the video. The look was inspired by the night swimming scenes in the movie Jaws."]}, {"page": "Radiohead discography", "response": ["| James Frost"]}, {"page": "Dave Matthews Band discography", "response": ["| James Frost"]}, {"page": "Norah Jones discography", "response": ["|James Frost", "|James Frost", "|James Frost"]}, {"page": "Come Away with Me (song)", "response": ["The music video of the song was directed by James Frost and shows Norah driving a car in a California desert.

This requires physical scanners and produces enormous amounts of data. In 2007 the band Radiohead used it extensively to create a music video for \"House of Cards\", capturing point cloud performances of the singer's face and of select environments in one of the first uses of this technology for volumetric capture. Director James Frost collaborated with media artist Aaron Koblin to capture 3D point-clouds used for this music clip, and while the final output of this work was still a rendered flat representation of the data, the capture and mindset of the authors was already ahead of its time. Point clouds, being distinct samples of three-dimensional space with position and color, create a high fidelity representation of the real world with a huge amount of data. However, viewing this data in real-time was not yet possible."]}]}}
