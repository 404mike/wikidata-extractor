They turned this down and in 1996, when the Students did apply to join they had to join at the bottom of the league system. It was soon apparent that the standard of rugby at the university had been left behind by the professional teams in the league and in 1998 a full-time Director of Rugby, Ian \"Dosser\" Smith, was appointed. Alan Buzza took over from Smith in 2001 and is credited with modernizing the club. League promotions in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 engendered confidence and the club was further enhanced by the presence of a number of excellent players including Tom Evans Jones, Edward Binham, Justin Abrahams, Andy Vilk, Peter Janes, James Jones, Sam Ulph and captain Charlie Cooper. As far as a British Universities championship win was concerned, however, the drought continued until, under the coach Paul Westgate, back to back wins were achieved in 2005 and 2006. Dave Morris took over as head coach from Westgate and immediately gained League promotion in 2007 to Midlands 1. The next season promotion was achieved to National League 2 North making the team the first student side to take part in the National Leagues. They finished in sixth place and in the same season achieved a win over England under-20s.History at LSRFC Official site ", "* Andy Vilk (Sevens)"]}, {"page": "Vilk", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Vilk"]}, {"page": "List of Old Oratorians", "response": ["*Andy Vilk rugby union player."]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Games medallists in rugby sevens", "response": ["|Henry PaulMagnus LundBen RussellDavid SeymourNils MordtRichard HaughtonThomas VarndellAndy VilkDanny CareBen GollingsSimon AmorMathew Tait"]}, {"page": "2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens squads \u2013 Men", "response": ["#Andy Vilk"]}]}}
