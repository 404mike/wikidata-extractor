Meanwhile, a familiar face returned to Plainmoor in the form of striker Martin Gritton, who had enjoyed a successful spell with the Gulls between 2002 and 2004.  Although still under contract to League Two rivals Chesterfield, Gritton was allowed to join Torquay on loan until January 2011.  Another (more recent) fan favourite, Guy Branston also re-joined the Gulls, with the combative defender agreeing a permanent one-year deal having been on loan from Burton Albion for the latter half of the 2009\u201310 season.  However, another Plainmoor hero, Wayne Carlisle, was deemed a free agent after the winger failed to agree a new contract due, in part, to his ongoing struggle with injury.", "One new face who appeared during the month was full back Danny Senda. The ex-Millwall and Wycombe defender had impressed Paul Buckle after recently playing in reserve team games against Exeter City and Forest Green.  Unfortunately, his debut match, at home to Macclesfield, coincided with a further downturn in the Gulls fortunes when they were beaten 3\u20131.  A chance to make amends came three days later with another home match, this time against former Conference rivals Aldershot.  However, with midfielder Damon Lathrope leaving the field injured after only 14 minutes on his first League start, Torquay could not find a way past a resolute Shots defence and were eventually sunk by a Marvin Morgan goal in the 86th minute.", "|22 ||  || MF || Damon Lathrope || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0", "|Damon Lathrope"]}, {"page": "Damon Len Lathrope", "response": ["#REDIRECT Damon Lathrope"]}, {"page": "2011 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Neither side made any changes to their personnel during the interval and the second half started with Torquay United applying pressure.  Five minutes in, Kee was sent clear with a pass from Kevin Nicholson and went one-one-one with the Stevenage goalkeeper Chris Day but his weak shot was deflected round the goalpost.  In the 55th minute, Zebroski was shown the first yellow card of the match for foul on Roberts.  Three minutes later, Stevenage made the first substitution of the match, with Darren Murphy replacing Byrom.  Soon after, Mousinho was booked for time-wasting before Harrison was brought on by Stevenage as a substitute for Reid who had injured his hamstring.  Charles then saw his low shot saved by Bevan before Zebroski's shot following an error from Roberts hit the side netting.  Jake Robinson's  strike was saved by Day and then Zebroski shot over the Stevenage bar.  Murphy's close-range header went wide of the Torquay United goal before Robinson's shot hit the Stevenage crossbar.  In the 79th minute, Joe Oastler came on to replace Damon Lathrope and was booked a minute later for a foul on Harrison.  Three minutes later, Branston's initial shot from a Stevenage corner was blocked and he struck the rebound over the bar from around .  With seven minutes of regular time remaining, Torquay United made a double-substitution, with Danny Stevens and Lathaniel Rowe-Turner coming on for Robinson and Nicholson.  Stevenage then brought Beardsley on to replace Charles.
