He was elected to the British Academy in 2006.In a 1991 article in the international relations journal International Affairs, he set out a position which he labelled \"utopian realism\". Within the terminology of international relations theory, he is considered a post-positivist and a critic of orthodox realism by contemporary academics in the field of international relations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "International relations", "response": ["A prominent derivative of Marxian thought is critical international relations theory which is the application of \"critical theory\" to international relations. Early critical theorists were associated with the Frankfurt School, which followed Marx's concern with the conditions that allow for social change and the establishment of rational institutions. Their emphasis on the \"critical\" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism. Modern-day proponents such as Andrew Linklater, Robert W. Cox and Ken Booth focus on the need for human emancipation from the nation-state. Hence, it is \"critical\" of mainstream IR theories that tend to be both positivist and state-centric."]}, {"page": "Aberystwyth University", "response": ["The department has hosted various notable academic staff in the field including E.
