Hoskins was a leading member of the Samuel Phelps company at Sadler's Wells and tutor to a young Sir Henry Irving, securing Irving's first acting job for him. Hoskins emigrated to Australia in 1856 to take up management of a theatre. The teenage Irving intended to accompany him, but family duties detained him in England where he went on to become the greatest exponent of Shakespeare of 19th Century British theatre. Irving never forgot Hoskins and paid warm tribute in his autobiography. As actor-manager, Hoskins played in Sydney, Melbourne, New Zealand and America and his performances became legend in their time. He died in New Zealand in 1886 and his obituary stated \"as a student and critical reader of Shakespeare, he had certainly no superiors in any part of the world\". Of Welsh descent, Creyton's grandfather was born Thomas George Parry in New Zealand and was adopted at birth by Hoskins who later trained him as an actor. Wanting to succeed on his own merits, he changed his name for the stage to Paul Creyton. Creyton left New Zealand for Australia in 1897 and performed in Sydney and Melbourne before establishing his own repertory company in Queensland."]}, {"page": "Henry John Wallack", "response": ["He and Frances, an actress, had a son James and two daughters, Julia Wallack, a vocalist, and Fanny Wallack, an actress.

His family remained in London during this period, giving young Appleton the opportunity to follow his interest in theatre, seeing all the shows and taking elocution and acting lessons from William Hoskins.
