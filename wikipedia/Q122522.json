He later joined the Conservative Party. He proved highly successful in modernizing the British road system in 1934\u20131937 as Minister of Transport. As War Secretary, 1937\u20131940, he feuded with the commanding generals and was removed in 1940. Anti-semitism played a role in blocking his appointment as Minister of Information.\nHis biographer compares his strong and weak points:\n\nHe was a brilliant speaker, a warm and engaging personality, a go-getter and a persistent driver, a master of the unconventional or indirect approach, a patriot and a man of moral and physical courage, not a great intellect but an original with a flair for imaginative gestures and for public relations. He also had personal weaknesses. He was extremely self-centred and had a fine conceit of himself. At times he was accused of sharp practice. ... Sharp practitioner or not, [his] quickness of mind and tongue, and transparent ambition to be seen to succeed, made him vulnerable to smears. ... His over-assertiveness ... led him to appear inconsiderate of the feelings and views of others.\nHis name is still widely associated in the UK with the amber \"Belisha beacons\" which were installed at pedestrian crossings while he was Minister for Transport.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Militia", "response": ["The name was briefly revived in the Military Training Act 1939, in the aftermath of the Munich Crisis. Leslie Hore-Belisha, Secretary of State for War, wished to introduce a limited form of conscription, not known in peacetime Britain since the militia of the early 19th century and previously. It was thought that calling the conscripts 'militiamen' would make this more acceptable, as it would render them distinct from the rest of the army. Only single men aged 20 up to the day before their 22nd birthday were to be conscripted, for six months full-time training before discharge into the reserve (with a free suit of civilian clothing). Although the first intake was called up in late July 1939, the declaration of war on 3 September entailed implementation of full-time conscription for all men aged 18\u201341, superseding the militia, never to be revived."]}, {"page": "September 7", "response": ["*1893 \u2013 Leslie Hore-Belisha, English politician, Secretary of State for War (d. 1957)"]}, {"page": "Reims", "response": ["The British statesman Leslie Hore-Belisha died of a cerebral haemorrhage while making a speech at the H\u00f4tel de Ville in February 1957."]}, {"page": "Stanley Baldwin", "response": ["* October 1936 \u2013 Walter Elliot succeeded Collins as Scottish Secretary.

Supporters of Montgomery-Massingberd proposed that the tank element of the division should be formed from cavalry regiments equipped only with light tanks and that the tank brigade and its heavier tanks be removed from the division.
