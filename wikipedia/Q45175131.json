Colchester took the lead through leading scorer Jevani Brown after 16-minutes, before he doubled the U's lead after 38-minutes. He secured his second hat-trick in a week after the break when he converted from the penalty spot following a foul on Josh Bohui. Brown was then replaced by Samson Tovide who came on to make his professional debut for the club. Michael Folivi registered his first goal for Colchester to make the score 4\u20130 on 62-minutes. Noah Chilvers made it 5\u20130 with 20 minutes remaining, and Kwame Poku scored his first of the season to make it six on 83-minutes. Southend did manage to score a consolation in the second minute of injury time through Kazaiah Sterling. The victory was Colchester's biggest of the season to date, and the largest margin of victory in any Essex derby encounter for either side."]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2021 || CF ||  || Kazaiah Sterling ||  || Released || "]}]}}
