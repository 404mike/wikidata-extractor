He made his debut for City on 5 September 1903, playing at left back away to Stoke City on the opening day of the 1903\u201304 season. In 1906, in the wake of a scandal regarding players' wages, Manchester City were forced into selling most of their players, and Burgess was purchased by Manchester United along with Sandy Turnbull, Jimmy Bannister and Billy Meredith. After helping the club to the 1907\u201308 Football League title, Burgess left the club and moved to Denmark to play for Kristiania. He then emigrated to Hungary, where he played for MTK Budapest, before becoming their manager. In the 1920s, Burgess' managerial career took him to Italy, where he became the manager of Padova. He had a two-year spell at Milan before returning to Padova, but two years later he was on the move again, this time to Roma.Burgess was capped four times for England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A.S.

He joined on a free transfer and received a \u00a3500 signing-on fee from United; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match, and he was willing to forego on the agreement if the club instead granted his transfer. He returned from suspension on 1 January 1907, and marked his debut at Bank Street with an assist for Sandy Turnbull to score the only goal of the game against Aston Villa. In addition to Turnbull, Meredith was joined at United by former City teammates Jimmy Bannister and Herbert Burgess. This new forward line made the team into a powerful force, as they already possessed a dominant half-back line in captain Charlie Roberts, Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell. They ended the 1906\u201307 season in eighth place in the First Division."]}, {"page": "Sandy Turnbull", "response": ["Born in Hurlford to James and Jessie Turnbull of 1 Gibson Street, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Turnbull started his football career with his hometown club, Hurlford Thistle. He later moved to Manchester City. In 1905, City was found guilty of malpractice relating to payments of its players, and the entire squad was suspended from playing football. When the ban was lifted on 31 December 1906, Turnbull moved to City's crosstown rivals Manchester United, along with Billy Meredith, Herbert Burgess and Jimmy Bannister. His first game for United came on the next day, 1 January 1907, against Aston Villa. Along with Meredith, he helped the club to their first championship in 1908 and the 1909 FA Cup, scoring the only goal in the final, against Bristol City. In 1908 alone, he would score 27 goals in 25 games. On 19 February 1909, Turnbull scored the first ever goal at Old Trafford, in a 4\u20133 loss against Liverpool. He would go on to score 100 goals for the club in 245 games. His final game for the Reds came against Sheffield United in 1915."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.

It paid off, and Manchester United won their first League Championship in 1908. They even attempted to sign Australian rugby footballer, Dally Messenger, a man recognised by some to be the top footballer of any code in his day.

The first meeting between the clubs to take place at the highest level of English football occurred in December 1906, a 3\u20130 City win in a First Division match for which the gate receipts exceeded \u00a31,000, a very large figure for the era. At this time City were suffering the after-effects of a financial scandal in which the club were found guilty of making off-balance sheet payments to players. As a result, seventeen players were suspended and banned from ever representing the club again,Ward, The Manchester City Story, p. 14. including the core of the team which had won the 1904 FA Cup. When the suspensions ended in January 1907, four players (Jimmy Bannister, Herbert Burgess, Billy Meredith and Sandy Turnbull) joined United, where they helped United gain their first league title in 1908. In contrast to modern antipathy, the transfers were generally welcomed for helping a fellow Manchester club.James, Manchester \u2013 A Football History, pp. 117\u20139 The following season Turnbull became the first player to be sent off in a derby.Cawley & James, The Pride of Manchester, p. 41.", "The first transfers of note between the clubs occurred in 1906. During the 1905\u201306 season City became embroiled in a financial scandal, which resulted in the suspension of seventeen players,James, Manchester \u2013 A Football History, p.116. including most of the team that had won the 1904 FA Cup Final. United signed four of these players: Billy Meredith, Sandy Turnbull, Herbert Burgess and Jimmy Bannister. All four were subsequently part of the team which won United's first major trophy, the 1908 league championship.", "!scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| Herbert Burgess"]}]}}
