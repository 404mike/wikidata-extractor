Two of Albion's finest players, Remi Moses and Bryan Robson, soon joined Atkinson at Old Trafford and this had a negative effect on Albion's previously good league fortunes. He signed Steve MacKenzie, Andy King, Martin Jol, and Romeo Zondervan; none of whom would prove particularly effective. Albion did well in the cup competitions, reaching the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup, although they suffered an early exit from the UEFA Cup. But Allen was unable to put together a good run of form in the First Division, and Albion only stayed up after winning their final game of the season. He then ended his managerial career in May 1982, choosing instead to work as the club's general manager. He stepped down from this post in June 1983, though continued to coach and scout for the club during his retirement, until 1996. He even played in a testimonial match at Cheltenham in 1995, at the age of 66."]}, {"page": "Markyate", "response": ["* Andy King (14 August 1956 \u2013 27 May 2015) an English professional footballer and manager.
