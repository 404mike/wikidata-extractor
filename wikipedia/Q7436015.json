The promoters of the brand were Linus Schaxmann, Simon Raine and Simon Oates and, until 2004, Scott Bond. By August 2014, the only Gatecrasher venue remaining was located in the United Kingdom city of Birmingham. This venue was closed down permanently by the authorities on 25 November 2015.", "During the early 1990s, Scott Bond was a DJ for nightclubs in Birmingham. In approximately 1992, Bond met Simon Raine who was the manager of a club called Bakers at the time. Bond subsequently agreed to become the new resident DJ at Bakers, while Raine focused on the promotion of a new club night called Absolutely Ridiculous. In 1993, Bond started his own night at Bakers called Republica and later that year, the pair decided to collaborate on a new one-off event named Gatecrasher.", "Gatecrasher offered an all-night event, with big-name DJs throughout the night, with Judge Jules as resident DJ. This attracted people from all over the country who liked a style of music that was originally Techno and House oriented. The door admittance policy was notoriously strict, seemingly turning people away for no apparent reason. Instead of discouraging people to attend, this policy only made the event more popular as gaining admittance to the club only added to the sense of excitement. The door policy also ensured that only dedicated and enthusiastic clubbers gained access. This resulted in a clientele and atmosphere that was rare at that time in any club in the UK. The door policy, and fashion at the end of the 1990s, encouraged people to dress in a flamboyant style to ensure entry to the night. The club developed a cult following (Gatecrasher Kids) who in turn developed their own style of fashion, identifiable by fluorescent clothes, dummies, and spiky hair. Scott Bond's style of dance music was reflected in the DJs booked for the nights and at the end of the 1990s, Gatecrasher was instrumental in the rise of trance music with the use of DJs like Ferry Corsten.", "* Scott Bond"]}, {"page": "Agnelli & Nelson", "response": ["The pair have collaborated with other major artists, including Matt Darey, Jon the Dentist, Scott Bond, Solarstone, and Chicane.
