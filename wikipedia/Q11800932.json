Left an orphan, she went to live with her mother's sister Mary who farmed at Thackwood, Stockdalewath. She was educated at the Dame school at Raughton Head, before being privately tutored, at home, by masters from the Sebergham Grammar School, where the poet Joseph Relph had been Headmaster.", "Her brother William, who married to a sister of John Christian Curwen was the father of William Blamire, who served as High Sheriff of Cumberland and MP for Cumberland. Another brother, Richard, was a bookseller in London who published many of William Gilpin's work regarding the picturesque. Through these brothers, Susanna was introduced to the London literary milieu. Her sister married Colonel Graham of Gartmore, who was an officer in the\u00a0Highland regiment,\u00a0through whom she had contacts in Scotland.

So, it is certainly possible that an academic like Young, living so closely in a rural community would have known of or read Susanna's writings.Christopher Maycock, A Passionate, Susanna Blamire, pp 115-118 The Byron Scholar, Professor Jerome McGann, University of Virginia, believed: \u2018It seems quite possible that Susanna\u2019s poem was in Byron\u2019s mind when he wrote The Prisoner of Chillon.\u2019.Ibid"]}, {"page": "Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|William Blamire ||Whig"]}, {"page": "Richard Clement Moody", "response": ["Richard Clement Moody's siblings included Major Thomas Moody (1809 - 1839); Reverend James Leith Moody (1816 -1896), Chaplain to Royal Navy in China and to the British Army in the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Malta, and Crimea; Colonel Hampden Clement Blamire Moody CB (1821 - 1869), Commander of the Royal Engineers in China during the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion; and Shute Barrington Moody  (b. 1818), an expert on sugar cultivation.
