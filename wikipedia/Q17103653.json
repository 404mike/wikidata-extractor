Johnson had two loan spells in non-League at Boreham Wood, as well as spending time on loan at St Albans City, Nuneaton Town and Kidderminster Harriers.\nHe signed for Kidderminster on a permanent basis in January 2019 and spent a year-and-a-half playing regularly in the National League North. After playing one match for Rushall Olympic, Johnson signed for Hartlepool United in September 2020. He helped the club earn promotion back into the Football League during the 2020\u201321 season.

Clarke was named as September's Manager of the Month award after overseeing a run of three wins from four games which took his side into the automatic promotion places.

Clarke's first signing as manager was Brad Walker, a defensive ball playing central midfielder who had been released from League One club Shrewsbury Town. He then paid Blackpool an undisclosed fee for central midfielder Ben Garrity, who he described as \"young, hungry and ambitious\". Biddulph-born James Wilson was then signed upon his release from Salford City, a 25-year old striker who had come through Manchester United as a highly rated teenager. The club also confirmed that Andy Crosby would be staying on at the club as assistant manager, which director of football David Flitcroft said was \"a really important signing\" due to his \"outstanding coaching, organisational skills, knowledge, work ethic and enthusiasm\". Aaron Martin, a 31-year old centre-back who had previously worked with Crosby at Southampton, then joined on a two-year deal. Another former Salford City player, left-back Dan Jones, then joined on a two-year deal. Taking Brown's place in goal was 30-year old Brazilian Lucas Covolan, who had been on the losing side of the National League play-off final despite scoring a stoppage-time equaliser for Torquay United. Aidan Stone, a 21-year old goalkeeper released from Mansfield Town, also joined the club. Defender Ryan Johnson was added after he rejected a contract from newly promoted Hartlepool United.

Chris Hussey, a 33-year old defender with 498 career appearances, was signed from Cheltenham Town for an undisclosed fee. The club then signed 28-year old defender Connor Hall from Harrogate Town for an undisclosed fee, whilst Leon Legge was allowed to move in the opposite direction. The club played their first home league fixture in seven weeks on 15 January, losing 3\u20131 to play-off rivals Swindon Town after Covolan was sent off on the stroke of half-time for kicking out at Harry McKirdy; a furious Clarke said that \"he has got to learn from that otherwise he won\u2019t be staying at the club for very long\".", "|align=\"left\"|DF||15||align=\"left\"| Ryan Johnson", "|15||||DF||Ryan Johnson||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0", "| 1 July 2021 || CB ||  || Ryan Johnson || Hartlepool United || Free transfer || ", "| 6 January 2022 || CB ||  || Ryan Johnson || Stockport County || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2021 National League play-off Final", "response": ["|CB ||15||Ryan Johnson "]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 27 June 2021 || DF || Ryan Johnson || Port Vale || Free || "]}, {"page": "Ryan Anthony Johnson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ryan Johnson (footballer, born 1996)"]}]}}
