However, the term voiceless approximant is seen by some phoneticians as controversial. It has been pointed out that if approximant is defined as a speech sound that involves the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough to create turbulent airflow, then it is difficult to see how a voiceless approximant could be audible. As John C. Wells puts it in his blog, \"voiceless approximants are by definition inaudible\u00a0... If there's no friction and no voicing, there's nothing to hear.\" A similar point is made in relation to frictionless continuants by : \"There are no voiceless frictionless continuants because this would imply silence; the voiceless counterpart of the frictionless continuant is the voiceless fricative.\"  argue that the increased airflow arising from voicelessness alone makes a voiceless continuant a fricative, even if lacking a greater constriction in the oral cavity than a voiced approximant."]}, {"page": "Esperanto", "response": ["In 1921 the French Academy of Sciences recommended using Esperanto for international scientific communication.

The distribution of these two in these accents does not always align to what their spelling suggests:  is used when after a labial consonant (e.g. fern), when spelled as \"ur\" or \"or\" (e.g. word), or when spelled as \"ir\" after an alveolar stop (e.g. dirt);  is used in all other situations.

Wells conducted research into speech in Montserrat in 1977\u201378 (which included also Montserratians resident in London). He found media claims that Irish speech, whether Anglo-Irish or Irish Gaelic, influenced contemporary Montserratian speech were largely exaggerated. He found little in phonology, morphology or syntax that could be attributed to Irish influence, and in Wells' report, only a small number of Irish words in use, one example being minseach  which he suggests is the noun goat."]}]}}
