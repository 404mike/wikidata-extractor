An inside forward, he played for Stockport County and Portsmouth.\nBorn in West Kilbride, Reid started his working life as an apprentice plumber in Manchester. After a spell in amateur football, he joined Stockport County, and turned professional in 1936. Playing at wing-half, Reid was part of the team that won Division Three North.\nIn 1946, at the age of 28, he was sold to Portsmouth for \u00a37,000. Although Portsmouth fans were initially sceptical, he won them over by scoring 29 goals in his first season, ending it as the club's top scorer. Known for his blistering shots, his nickname; 'thunderboots' was re-affirmed when, at Fratton Park he put the ball through the net and into the crowd when scoring a penalty against Manchester City. His goals helped Portsmouth win First Division titles in 1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350, with a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 final-day win in the 1949\u201350 season helping Portsmouth claim the title on goal average.\nWith his Portsmouth days over, Reid moved to non-league team Tonbridge in 1956 before returning to the south coast once again as Portsmouths groundsman, a post he held until 1978. Reid also ran a hostel for the club's young footballers in Southsea.\nReid's son David also played for England at amateur level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portsmouth F.C.", "response": ["In their 50-year \"Golden Jubilee\" anniversary 1948\u201349 season, Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win a historic Football League and FA Cup \"double\".
