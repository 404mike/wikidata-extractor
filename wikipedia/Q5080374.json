His family descended from the Lucys of Charlecote, Warwickshire, who afterwards settled in Worcestershire.He is best known for his painting of The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, which is displayed in the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, Massachusetts, in the United States of America. His other notable work include his engravings of Oliver Cromwell and a painting called, The Burial of King Charles the First, in St. George's Chapel of Windsor Castle, which was sold by the London auction house, Bonhams, in October 11, 2006.\nFor sixteen years Mr. Lucy took up his residence in Paris, Barbizon and Fontainebleau, where he reared his children with his wife, Ann. He continued to maintain his connection with Hereford, of which, according to the Freeman's Roll, he was admitted a freeman on July 29, 1841, thereby bestowing Mr. Lucy with certain rights and privileges within his native city. But it was while he was in France that he executed several of his greatest works, before he returned to London, where he resided until his death.He died on 19 May 1873 from liver cancer and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, located in North London, England. The estate sale of his studio's contents included unsold paintings and was held at the London auction house, Christie's, on the 4th and 5 June 1875.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* Charles Lucy, British artist, whose most notable painting was The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers"]}, {"page": "Royal Academy of Arts", "response": ["In 1769, the first year of operation, the Schools enrolled 77 students.

In 1841, he began to read law at University College, London, evidently sporadically as he did not qualify as a solicitor until 1847, partly because he had become interested in learning to be a painter. In Yorkshire in 1843 Fenton married Grace Elizabeth Maynard, presumably after his first sojourn in Paris (his passport was issued in 1842) where he may briefly have studied painting in the studio of Paul Delaroche. When he registered as a copyist in the Louvre in 1844 he named his teacher as the history and portrait painter Michel Martin Drolling, who taught at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, but Fenton's name does not appear in the school records. By 1847 Fenton had returned to London where he continued to study painting under the tutelage of the history painter Charles Lucy, who became his friend and with whom, starting in 1850, he served on the board of the North London School of Drawing and Modelling. In 1849, 1850 and 1851 he exhibited paintings in the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy."]}, {"page": "Paul Delaroche", "response": ["Delaroche was born in Paris and stayed there for the majority of his life.
