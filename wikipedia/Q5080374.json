His family descended from the Lucys of Charlecote, Warwickshire, who afterwards settled in Worcestershire.He is best known for his painting of The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, which is displayed in the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, Massachusetts, in the United States of America. His other notable work include his engravings of Oliver Cromwell and a painting called, The Burial of King Charles the First, in St. George's Chapel of Windsor Castle, which was sold by the London auction house, Bonhams, in October 11, 2006.\nFor sixteen years Mr. Lucy took up his residence in Paris, Barbizon and Fontainebleau, where he reared his children with his wife, Ann. He continued to maintain his connection with Hereford, of which, according to the Freeman's Roll, he was admitted a freeman on July 29, 1841, thereby bestowing Mr. Lucy with certain rights and privileges within his native city. But it was while he was in France that he executed several of his greatest works, before he returned to London, where he resided until his death.He died on 19 May 1873 from liver cancer and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, located in North London, England. The estate sale of his studio's contents included unsold paintings and was held at the London auction house, Christie's, on the 4th and 5 June 1875.", "link_mentions": {}}}
