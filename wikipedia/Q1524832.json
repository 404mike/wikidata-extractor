He studied mechanical engineering at University of Hertfordshire, which was famous for its aeronautical engineers, graduating with a first class honors degree. He was hired by Williams through an advertisement in the media in 1988 after spending time with Ricardo transmissions. A few months later, Adrian Newey joined Williams from Leyton House and Fisher worked with him until Newey left in 1997 to join McLaren. Fisher, his pupil, was promoted to the role of chief designer, a role that he held until 2005.\nIn September 2004, Gavin Fisher was seriously injured in a motorbike crash and underwent surgery for a broken pelvis in a hospital in Los Angeles. Senior designer Mark Loasby took over the design of next year's Williams race car during his absence.Fisher currently follows a number of pursuits including snowboarding, riding motorbikes and sailing boats.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 30", "response": ["*1964 \u2013 Gavin Fisher, English engineer and designer"]}, {"page": "University of Hertfordshire", "response": ["*Gavin Fisher \u2013 Former chief designer of the Williams Formula One team."]}, {"page": "Geoff Willis", "response": ["In 1987 after a degree at Cambridge University in engineering, he was approached to join the design team of the Peter de Savary's British America's Cup challenge and he spent the next three years designing and developing hull and keel designs for the team in preparation for the competition in San Diego.  Prior to working for Honda, Willis was employed as chief aerodynamicist by the Williams Formula One team and also worked as a consultant at the Leyton House team in the early 1990s. While at Leyton House, Willis met Adrian Newey and it was through this association that he joined Williams, after Newey was recruited by the British team.
