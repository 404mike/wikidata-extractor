Bailey served her mayoral term from 2007 to 2008. Bailey became a member of the city council in 2002, when she was elected to represent the suburb of East Chesterton within Cambridge. She served the council continuously from 2002 to 2007, rising the ranks until she was chosen to become mayor in 2007. Prior to her appointment as full mayor, she acted as a deputy in 2006.\nShe was the first transgender mayor in the United Kingdom, but not the first in the world as Georgina Beyer, also a trans woman, became Mayor of Carterton, New Zealand in 1995. Bailey herself was keen to play down the significance of her appointment, saying, \"I don't want to let it define me.\" Bailey had undergone gender transitioning 11 years prior to assuming office in the council.Bailey was married before her transition, and became a parent to two sons. Bailey and her longtime companion Jennifer Liddle entered into a civil partnership on 22 September 2011. Liddle, a former councillor, is also a trans woman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of transgender people", "response": ["| Jenny Bailey"]}, {"page": "Bailey (surname)", "response": ["* Jenny Bailey (born 1962), British politician"]}, {"page": "2007 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 24 May \u2013 Jenny Bailey became the first transgender mayor in the United Kingdom."]}, {"page": "2007 in LGBT rights", "response": ["* 24 \u2013 Jenny Bailey becomes the first transsexual mayor in the United Kingdom."]}, {"page": "List of LGBT firsts by year", "response": ["* Jenny Bailey \u2013 the first openly transgender mayor in the United Kingdom.
