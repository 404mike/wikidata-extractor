Wade's time in Parliament coincided with the time the Liberals were at their lowest ebb but his job as Chief Whip kept the party operating until times were better; however, his own seat was dependent on a local pact with the Conservatives and when it broke down, he was defeated. He was then elevated to the House of Lords where he became an active Peer.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1988 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 6 November \u2013  Donald Wade, Baron Wade, lawyer and politician (born 1904)"]}, {"page": "Donald Wade", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donald Wade, Baron Wade"]}, {"page": "Donald William Wade", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donald Wade, Baron Wade"]}, {"page": "Baron Wade", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donald Wade, Baron Wade"]}, {"page": "Lord Wade", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donald Wade, Baron Wade"]}, {"page": "List of people from Ilkley", "response": ["* Donald Wade, Baron Wade (deceased), Liberal Party Member of Parliament"]}]}}
