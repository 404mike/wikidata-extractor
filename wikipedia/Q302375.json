He batted at number nine and top scored, but failed to keep a regular place in the team. He re-emerged as an opening batsman in 1911 and was then a regular in the team until 1932, when he retired. A defensive batsman in what was, until the arrival of Wally Hammond in the mid-1920s, usually a weak batting line-up, Dipper exceeded 1,000 runs in a season 15 times and went on to 2,000 five times. His full aggregate of 28,075 runs puts him 73rd on the all-time list of run-getters and he made 53 centuries.\nDipper played in just one Test match for England, against Australia at Lord's in 1921, the year when many new players were tried against the all-conquering team led by Warwick Armstrong. Dipper scored 40 and 11, but was dropped. His lack of mobility as a fielder probably cost him further consideration.\nIn retirement, Dipper stood as a first-class umpire. He was also a high standard player of bowls and billiards.", "link_mentions": {}}}
