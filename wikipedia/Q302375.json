He batted at number nine and top scored, but failed to keep a regular place in the team. He re-emerged as an opening batsman in 1911 and was then a regular in the team until 1932, when he retired. A defensive batsman in what was, until the arrival of Wally Hammond in the mid-1920s, usually a weak batting line-up, Dipper exceeded 1,000 runs in a season 15 times and went on to 2,000 five times. His full aggregate of 28,075 runs puts him 73rd on the all-time list of run-getters and he made 53 centuries.\nDipper played in just one Test match for England, against Australia at Lord's in 1921, the year when many new players were tried against the all-conquering team led by Warwick Armstrong. Dipper scored 40 and 11, but was dropped. His lack of mobility as a fielder probably cost him further consideration.\nIn retirement, Dipper stood as a first-class umpire. He was also a high standard player of bowls and billiards.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Alfred Dipper|| 27,948"]}, {"page": "Dipper (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Alfred Dipper (1885\u20131945), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Apperley", "response": ["Apperley has a cricket club that reached the final of the National Village Cricket Championship in 1998.

The greater responsibility added a tighter defence to his flashing array of drives and cuts, and he was picked for England against the West Indies in 1933.  He marked his debut with a half century, batting at number 8, and passed 2,000 runs for the season.  Although he remained vulnerable to an early dismissal, once set he was a formidable player and he recorded 48 centuries in all.  Eleven sixes in an innings of 194 against Somerset in 1934, stands as a testament to the power of his stroke play.  He failed to pass 1,500 runs in only two seasons, and gradually developed his left arm medium pace bowling, as a useful adjunct to his batting."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Tipper", "response": ["Tipper made his debut on 23 June against Gloucestershire, and his 42 in the first innings helped avert a crisis; he had come in with the score on 27/5, but his steadying knock helped the team to 201.
