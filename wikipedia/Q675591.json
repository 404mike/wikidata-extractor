Taylor insisted that he had not realised that the dart had missed and offered to replay the match and forfeit his prize money. The PDC released a statement blaming the incident on human error. The incident led to a feud with Taylor's old mentor Eric Bristow who stated: \"The player knows if it's not in the bed and has to declare it. You don't want cheats in the game\".
