In his Lacan at the Scene (2009), Bond made contributions to theoretical psychoanalysis and forensics.\nIn 1990, with Sarah Lucas, Bond organised the art exhibition East Country Yard Show, which was influential in the formation and development of the Young British Artists movement; together with Damien Hirst, Angela Bulloch, and Liam Gillick, the two were \"the earliest of the YBAs.\"Bond's visual art tends to appropriation and pastiche; he has exhibited work made collaboratively with YBA artists including a photograph made with Sam Taylor-Wood and the Documents Series, made with Liam Gillick. In the 1990s, Bond was a photojournalist working for British fashion, music, and youth culture magazine The Face. In 1998, his photobook of street fashions in London The Cult of the Street was published. His Point and Shoot (Cantz, 2000), explored the photo-genres of surveillance, voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism.\nIn 2007, Bond completed his doctoral research; in 2009, he was appointed Senior Lecturer in Photography at Kingston University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 13", "response": ["*1966 \u2013 Henry Bond, English photographer and curator"]}, {"page": "List of photographers", "response": ["* Henry Bond (born 1966)"]}, {"page": "Camberwell", "response": ["The core of the later-to-be YBAs, graduated from the Goldsmiths BA Fine Art degree course in the classes of 1987\u201390.

It was in the early 1990s when Lucas began using furniture as a substitute for the human body, usually with crude genital punning.

For six months in 1993, Lucas and fellow artist Tracey Emin rented a retail space in east London, The Shop, where they made artworks, ranging from printed mugs to T-shirts with slogans, and put them on sale. In works such as Bitch (table, T-shirt, melons, and vacuum-packed smoked fish, 1995), she merges tabloid culture with the economy of the ready-made. In earlier work, she had displayed enlarged pages from the Sunday Sport newspaper. Through her career, Lucas has continued to appropriate everyday materials (including, for example, freshly made fried eggs) to make works that use humour, visual puns and sexual metaphors of sex, death, Englishness and gender."]}, {"page": "Sam Taylor-Johnson", "response": ["Taylor-Johnson began exhibiting fine-art photography in the early 1990s.
