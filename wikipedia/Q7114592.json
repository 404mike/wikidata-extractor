He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. Born in Coventry, his first-class career began with Glamorgan in 1994, playing twice during the 1994 County Championship, and taking 5/28 on his Sunday League debut, after a season in which he had spent much of the time incapacitated with a back injury. For a few years, he was a regular member of the Glamorgan team in both 4-day and 1-day cricket, but towards the end of his career, he was regarded more as a specialist one-day bowler, and played an important role in Glamorgan's National League successes in the early 2000s. He retired from first-class cricket in 2003.\nBefore joining Glamorgan, he played in the 1991 Second XI championship with Hampshire and also for Dorset Minor Counties.\nFollowing his retirement, Parkin went into education as a mathematics teacher. He taught at Milton Abbey School from 2008 to 2011, and at Canford School from 2011 onwards. He has been a housemaster at both establishments.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Owen Parkin "]}, {"page": "1996 English cricket season", "response": ["|Owen Parkin"]}, {"page": "Parkin (surname)", "response": ["* Owen Parkin (born 1972), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Owen Parkin (1994\u20132003) : O.
