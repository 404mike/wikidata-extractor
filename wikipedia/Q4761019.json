In his first season as manager, a young Torquay side made the Division Three play-offs and lost the semi final against his old club Preston North End. The game will be remembered for a wrong decision by the referee to send off the Torquay defender Darren Moore which gave Preston an advantage and they went on to score four times to win 4\u20131 and 4\u20133 over the two legs. After selling some of his key players from the play-off season the following season was to produce a mid-table position of safety. The 1995\u201396 season started badly for Torquay, and O'Riordan was sacked after a heavy defeat at home to Scunthorpe United in October, with future Torquay forward Andy McFarlane scoring 4 goals. During his time in charge he brought through players into the 1st team such as Darren Moore Paul Trollope and Paul Buckle who later went on to manage Torquay. Torquay accepted offers for many of the young players developed by O'Riordan during his time in charge but his two Caribbean signings Bajan international Gregory Goodridge and Rodney Jack the Saint Vincent National Team player brought in a reported one million pounds in transfer fees between them selling Goodridge to QPR before and Jack to Crewe after his departure."]}, {"page": "Wayne Hockley", "response": ["Hockley was born in Paignton, Devon and joined Torquay United as a trainee, having previously played for local side Stoke Gabriel.
