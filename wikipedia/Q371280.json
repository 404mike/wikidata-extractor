There was also a tradition of private performances, with a variety of illustrated works to help with stage properties and costumes. Among these was Thomas Jefferys' A Collection of the Dresses of Different Nations, Antient and Modern (1757\u201372) which included a copperplate engraving of a crowned Circe in loose dress, holding a goblet aloft in her right hand and a long wand in her left.Published from London, p. 240. Evidence of such performances during the following decades is provided by several portraits in character, of which one of the earliest was the pastel by Daniel Gardner (1750\u20131805) of \"Miss Elliot as Circe\". The artist had been a pupil of both George Romney and Joshua Reynolds, who themselves were soon to follow his example. On the 1778 engraving based on Gardner's portrait appear the lines from Milton's Comus: The daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup / Whoever tasted, lost his upright shape / And downward fell into a grovelling swine, in compliment to the charm of this marriageable daughter of a country house. As in the Jefferys' plate, she wears a silver coronet over tumbled dark hair, with a wand in the right hand and a goblet in the left. In hindsight the frank eyes that look directly at the viewer and the rosebud mouth are too innocent for the role Miss Elliot is playing.", "Soon afterwards, the notorious Emma Hamilton was to raise this to an art form, partly by the aid of George Romney's many paintings of her impersonations. Romney's preliminary study of Emma's head and shoulders, at present in the Tate Gallery, with its piled hair, expressive eyes and mouth, is reminiscent of Samuel Gardener's portrait of Miss Elliot. In the full-length \"Lady Hamilton as Circe\" at Waddesdon Manor, she is placed in a wooded landscape with wolves snarling to her left, although the tiger originally there has now been painted out. Her left arm is raised to cast a spell while the wand points downward in her right. After Emma moved to Naples and joined Lord Hamilton, she developed what she called her \"Attitudes\" into a more public entertainment. Specially designed, loose-fitting tunics were paired with large shawls or veils as she posed in such a way as to evoke figures from Classical mythology. These developed from mere poses, with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes that she portrayed, into small, wordless charades.Julia Peakman, Emma Hamilton, London 2005, pp. 47\u201350."]}, {"page": "Joshua Reynolds", "response": ["Renowned for his placidity, Reynolds often claimed that he \"hated nobody\".

Romney was named AMC's president and chairman of the board the same month.", "When Romney took over, he cancelled Mason's plan to merge AMC with Studebaker-Packard Corporation (or any other automaker). He reorganized upper management, brought in younger executives, and pruned and rebuilt AMC's dealer network. Romney believed that the only way to compete with the \"Big Three\" (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) was to stake the future of AMC on a new smaller-sized car line.  Together with chief engineer Meade Moore, by the end of 1957 Romney had completely phased out the Nash and Hudson brands, whose sales had been lagging. The Rambler brand was selected for development and promotion, as AMC pursued an innovative strategy: manufacturing only compact cars. The company struggled badly at first, losing money in 1956, more in 1957, and experiencing defections from its dealer network.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, p. 16.  Romney instituted company-wide savings and efficiency measures, and he and other executives reduced their salaries by up to 35\u00a0percent.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 190\u2013191.", "Romney was a high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood of the LDS, and beginning in 1944 he headed the Detroit church branch (which initially was small enough to meet in a member's house).Ostling; Ostling, Mormon America, p. 134. By the time he was AMC chief, he presided over the Detroit Stake, which included not only all of Metro Detroit, Ann Arbor, and the Toledo area of Ohio but also the western edge of Ontario along the Michigan border.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 3\u20134, 87. In this role, Romney oversaw the religious work of some 2,700\u00a0church members, occasionally preached sermons, and supervised the construction of the first stake tabernacle east of the Mississippi River in 100\u00a0years.  Because the stake covered part of Canada, he often interacted with Canadian Mission President Thomas S. Monson. Romney's rise to a leadership role in the church reflected the church's journey from a fringe pioneer religion to one that was closely associated with mainstream American business and values. Due in part to his prominence, the larger Romney family tree would become viewed as \"LDS royalty\".", "Starting in 1956, Romney headed a citizen-based committee for improved educational programs in Detroit's public schools.  The 1958, final report of the Citizens Advisory Committee on School Needs was largely Romney's work and received considerable public attention; it made nearly 200\u00a0recommendations for economy and efficiency, better teacher pay, and new infrastructure funding.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 228, 232\u2013233, 236\u2013237.Harris, Romney's Way, pp. 212\u2013214.  Romney helped a $90-million education-related bond issue and tax increase win an upset victory in an April 1959 statewide referendum.  He organized Citizens for Michigan in 1959, a nonpartisan group that sought to study Detroit's problems and build an informed electorate.Mahoney, The Story of George Romney, pp. 239, 244.  Citizens for Michigan built on Romney's belief that assorted interest groups held too much influence in government, and that only the cooperation of informed citizens acting for the benefit of all could counter them.", "Also in early 1960, Romney served on the Fair Campaign Practices Committee, a group also having Jewish, Catholic, mainline and evangelical Protestant, and Orthodox Christian members. It issued a report whose guiding principles were that no candidate for elected office should be supported or opposed due to their religion and that no campaign for office should be seen as an opportunity to vote for one religion against another. This statement helped pave the way for John F. Kennedy's famous speech on religion and public office later that year.Haws, The Mormon Image in the American Mind, pp. 15\u201316.  Romney briefly considered a run in the 1960 Senate election, but instead became a vice president of the constitutional convention that revised the Michigan constitution during 1961 and 1962.Dunbar; May, Michigan, p. 576.Mollenhoff, George Romney, pp. 168\u2013169.", "Romney was sworn in as governor on January 1, 1963.Mollenhoff, George Romney, p. 192.  His initial concern was the implementation of the overhaul of the state's financial and revenue structure that had been authorized by the constitutional convention.Dunbar; May, Michigan, p. 577.  In 1963, he proposed a comprehensive tax revision package that included a flat-rate state income tax, but general economic prosperity alleviated pressure on the state budget and the Michigan Legislature rejected the measure. Romney's early difficulties with the legislature helped undermine an attempted push that year of Romney as a national political figure by former Richard Nixon associates.White, The Making of the President, 1964, p. 88. One Michigan Democrat said of Romney, \"He has not yet learned that things in government are not necessarily done the moment the man at the top gives an order. He is eager and sometimes impatient.\" But over his first two years in office, Romney was able to work with Democrats\u00a0\u2013 who often had at least partial control of the legislature\u00a0\u2013 and an informal bipartisan coalition formed which allowed Romney to accomplish many of his goals and initiatives.", "Romney held a series of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public services professionals and community activists who attended.Harris, Romney's Way, p. 242.  He opened his office in the Michigan State Capitol to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted to speak with him on Thursday mornings, and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol.  He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath.  His blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction, and family members and associates used the idiom \"bull in a china shop\" to describe him.  He took a theatrical approach to governance, staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome. One former aide later said that willful was too weak a word to describe him, and chose messianic instead.  Romney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones; writer Theodore H. White said \"the first quality that surfaced, as one met and talked with George Romney over a number of years, was a sincerity so profound that, in conversation, one was almost embarrassed.\"", "During 1966, while son Mitt was away in France on missionary work, George Romney guided Mitt's fianc\u00e9e Ann Davies in her conversion to Mormonism.  Governor Romney continued his support of civil rights; after violence broke out during the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965, he marched at the front of a Detroit parade in solidarity with the marchers.  In 1966, Romney had his biggest electoral success, winning re-election again by some 527,000\u00a0votes over Democratic lawyer Zolton FerencyMollenhoff, George Romney, p. 249. (this time to a four-year term, after a change in Michigan law).  His share of the black vote rose to over 30\u00a0percent, a virtually unprecedented accomplishment for a Republican.", "There were strong political implications in the handling of the riot, as Romney was seen as a leading Republican contender to challenge Johnson's presidential re-election the following year; Romney believed the White House had intentionally slowed its response and he charged Johnson with having \"played politics\" in his actions.Mollenhoff, George Romney, pp. 283\u2013284. The riot notwithstanding, by the end of Romney's governorship the state had made strong gains in civil rights related to public employment, government contracting, and access to public accommodations.Fine, Expanding the Frontiers of Civil Rights, p. 335.  Lesser improvements were made in combating discrimination in private employment, housing, education, and law enforcement.  Considerable state and federal efforts were made during this time to improve the lot of Michigan's migrant farm workers and Native Americans, without much progress for either.", "Romney greatly expanded the size of state government while governor. His first state budget, for fiscal year 1963, was $550\u00a0million, a $20\u00a0million increase over that of his predecessor Swainson.Mollenhoff, George Romney, p. 269.  Romney had also inherited an $85\u00a0million budget deficit, but left office with a surplus.  In the following fiscal years, the state budget increased to $684\u00a0million for 1964, $820\u00a0million for 1965, $1\u00a0billion for 1966, $1.1\u00a0billion for 1967, and was proposed as $1.3\u00a0billion for 1968.  Romney led the way for a large increase in state spending on education, and Michigan began to develop one of the nation's most comprehensive systems of higher education.  There was a significant increase in funding support for local governments and there were generous benefits for the poor and unemployed.  Romney's spending was enabled by the post\u2013World War II economic expansion that generated continued government surpluses and by a consensus of both parties in Michigan to maintain extensive state bureaucracies and expand public sector services.", "Romney's greatest weakness was a lack of foreign policy expertise and a need for a clear position on the Vietnam War.  The press coverage of the trip focused on Vietnam and reporters were frustrated by Romney's initial reluctance to speak about it.  The qualities that helped Romney as an industry executive worked against him as a presidential candidate; he had difficulty being articulate, often speaking at length and too forthrightly on a topic and then later correcting himself while maintaining he was not.Witcover, Marathon, p. 88.White, The Making of the President, 1968, p. 40.  Reporter Jack Germond joked that he was going to add a single key on his typewriter that would print, \"Romney later explained ...\"  Life magazine wrote that Romney \"manages to turn self-expression into a positive ordeal\" and that he was no different in private: \"nobody can sound more like the public George Romney than the real George Romney let loose to ramble, inevitably away from the point and toward some distant moral precept.\"", "Romney was also the first Mormon to stage a credible run for the presidency.Haws, The Mormon Image in the American Mind, p. 12.  By this time, he was well known as a Mormon and perhaps the most nationally visible one since Brigham Young.Haws, The Mormon Image in the American Mind, pp. 13, 17.  But his membership in the LDS Church was scarcely mentioned at all during the campaign. What indirect discussion there was helped bring to national attention the church's policy regarding blacks, but the contrast of Romney's pro-civil rights stance deflected any criticism of him and indirectly benefited the image of the church. Some historians and Mormons suspected then and later that had Romney's campaign lasted longer and been more successful, his religion might have become a more prominent issue.  Romney's campaign did often focus on his core beliefs; a Romney billboard in New Hampshire read \"The Way To Stop Crime Is To Stop Moral Decay\".  Dartmouth College students gave a bemused reaction to his morals message, displaying signs such as \"God Is Alive and Thinks He's George Romney\".  A spate of books were published about Romney, more than for any other candidate, and included a friendly campaign biography, an attack from a former staffer, and a collection of Romney's speeches.", "Presidential historian Theodore H. White wrote that during his campaign Romney gave \"the impression of an honest and decent man simply not cut out to be President of the United States\".  Governor Rhodes more memorably said, \"Watching George Romney run for the presidency was like watching a duck try to make love to a football.\"White, The Making of the President, 1968, p. 54.", "That same year, Ronna Romney, Romney's ex-daughter-in-law (formerly married to G. Scott Romney), decided to seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate from Michigan.  While Mitt and G. Scott endorsed Ronna Romney, George Romney had endorsed her opponent and the eventual winner, Spencer Abraham, during the previous year when Ronna was considering a run but had not yet announced.  A family spokesperson said that George Romney had endorsed Abraham before knowing Ronna Romney would run and could not go back on his word, although he did refrain from personally campaigning on Abraham's behalf.", "The Presidents' Summit For America's Future took place in Philadelphia in 1997, manifesting Romney's last volunteerism proposal, with the organization America's Promise coming out of it. For many years, the Points of Light Foundation (and its predecessor organization) has given out an annual Lenore and George W. Romney Citizen Volunteer Award (later retitled the George and Lenore Romney Citizen Volunteer Award); the inaugural such award in 1987 went to George Romney himself. The Points of Light Foundation and the CNCS also give out a George W. Romney Volunteer Center Excellence Award (later the George W. Romney Excellence Award) at the annual National Conference on Community Volunteering and National Service (later the National Conference on Volunteering and Service).See for example , ,   The  George W. Romney Volunteer Center itself is sponsored by the United Way for Southeastern Michigan, and began during Romney's lifetime.", "The building housing the main offices of the Governor of Michigan in Lansing is known as the George W. Romney Building following a 1997 renaming.  The Governor George Romney Lifetime Achievement Award is given annually by the State of Michigan, to recognize citizens who have demonstrated a commitment to community involvement and volunteer service throughout their lifetimes.  In 2010, Adrian College in Michigan announced the opening of its George Romney Institute for Law and Public Policy.
