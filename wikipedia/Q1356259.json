He published 21 books and numerous short stories and features.  His humorous works were ranked with Jerome K. Jerome and W. W. Jacobs, his detective stories with Conan Doyle, his politico-science fiction with H. G. Wells, and his supernatural stories with Algernon Blackwood. George Orwell acknowledged that Bramah's book What Might Have Been influenced his Nineteen Eighty-Four. Bramah created the characters Kai Lung and Max Carrados.Bramah was a very private man who did not make public any details of his personal life. He died at the age of 74 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. After Bramah died, his widow presented to the Hammersmith borough libraries a collection of all his published books for reference use only. Bramah had lived in Hammersmith for some 30 years, not far from Ravenscourt Park.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Proverb", "response": ["Some authors have created proverbs in their writings, such as J.R.R.
