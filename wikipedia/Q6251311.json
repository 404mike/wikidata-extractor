There with enthusiasm he introduced his students to the works of such writers as David Jones, Idris Davies, Glyn Jones, Alun Lewis, Dylan Thomas, R. S. Thomas, John Ormond and Leslie Norris. His own poetry was influenced by the writings of Roy Campbell, and of R. S. Thomas and John Cowper Powys. During these years he published his A Sense of Europe (1968), A Sense of Time (1972) and Incense (1976), as well as his study, An Introduction to Anglo-Welsh Literature (1970) and the anthology, Anglo-Welsh Poetry 1480\u20131980 (1984) (which he edited with Roland Mathias). He also established a link with the Central University of Iowa, USA, for their module on Anglo-Welsh literature.  He continued lecturing at Trinity until he retired in 1987, when his Collected Poems 1946\u201386 appeared.
