They were a second-hand pair of Winit boots bought from the former Doncaster Rovers centre forward, Ray Harrison's sports shop. Keegan played football at Hyde Park using his baby brother Michael's pushchair as a goal post. As a boy he supported Doncaster Rovers. His favourite player was Alick Jeffrey, a player, once described by Matt Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy as the English Pel\u00e9, and once described by Jackie Milburn as \"the best young player he had ever seen\". As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for Coventry City, under manager Jimmy Hill. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back Brian Joy who also went on to have a 15-year career in football. Keegan also had a trial with Doncaster Rovers, arranged by his father, but when Keegan arrived, he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place."]}, {"page": "Doncaster Rovers F.C.", "response": ["During this time, several high class players were with Doncaster including Harry Gregg who kept goal, and was sold to Manchester United in December 1957 for \u00a323,500. At the time, he was the most expensive goalkeeper in the world. He went on to help save lives in the Munich air disaster and was a regular goalkeeper for Northern Ireland. Another player, lesser known outside Doncaster, was Alick Jeffrey. Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United, had lined him up to be bought, however in October 1956 Jeffrey badly broke his leg playing for England under-23s. This ended his move and any chance of what was seen to be an almost certain glittering international career to come."]}, {"page": "Peter Doherty (footballer)", "response": ["He made his final move to Doncaster Rovers in April 1949, where he assumed the role of player-manager. He scored 30 goals from 39 games in the 1949\u201350 season and led \"Donny\" to promotion as champions of the Third Division North. He was again top-scorer with 14 goals in 23 matches during the 1950\u201351 season as Rovers posted an 11th-place finish in the Second Division. He then settled more into his management role, helping the club to sign players from his home country such as Len Graham, Harry Gregg and Kit Lawlor, whilst overseeing the development of young players such as Alick Jeffrey. The club spent the next six seasons finishing in the lower half of the Second Division table: 1951\u201352 (16th), 1952\u201353 (13th), 1953\u201354 (12th), 1954\u201355 (18th) 1955\u201356 (17th) and 1956\u201357 (14th). He left Belle Vue when he resigned in January 1958 following a number of disputes with the club's board of directors; the club went on to be relegated at the end of the 1957\u201358 season."]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 in English football", "response": ["*Alick Jeffrey (Doncaster Rovers) \u2013 36 goals"]}, {"page": "Syd Bycroft", "response": ["He then qualified as a coach and working for Doncaster, he brought through players such as Alick Jeffrey."]}]}}
