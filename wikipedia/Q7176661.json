Watford won 10 and drew 2 of their first 12 games of 1915, with George Edmonds, Peter Ronald and injured Charlie White's replacement Arthur Green all scoring freely. A win and a defeat against Luton Town, a 2\u20130 defeat to West Ham United and a heavy 6\u20130 loss at Swindon enabled Reading and Cardiff to close in on Watford's points tally and goal average. But Watford secured the title in their penultimate match, with Fred Gregory scoring the decisive goal in a 3\u20132 win at Gillingham."]}, {"page": "Ronald, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Ronald"]}]}}
