In 1979 the league was re-organised and they were placed in the Midland Division. After a series of relatively uneventful seasons the former Scottish international and West Bromwich Albion legend Bobby Hope was appointed manager. Hope transformed the club's ambitions, and Rovers won the Midland Division in 1985\u201386 to gain a place in the Premier Division. Rovers also won the Southern League Cup that season to achieve a league/cup double. In 1986\u201387 Rovers almost gained back to back promotions but finished Premier Division runners-up to Fisher Athletic.  ", "This was the start of the most successful period in the club's history, particularly under the management of Bobby Hope.  After five years of consolidation, the 1991\u201392 season saw a remarkable run of 15 home wins in a row to pip Dover Athletic to the Premier Division title with a game to spare.  This saw Bromsgrove promoted to the Football Conference, the highest level of non-league football in England.", "After their cup exit Rovers endured a poor run of league results and had to rely on a 1\u20130 away win at league runners-up Kettering Town in the final match to avoid relegation. The 1994-95 season saw the departure of Bobby Hope, frustrated at the club's financial constraints. His replacement was former Republic of Ireland international Tony Grealish who only lasted a few months. The club had to appoint captain Kevin Richardson and Youth Team Manager John Dyer on a temporary basis, but were rewarded when  Bromsgrove won the Conference League Cup (or \"Spalding Cup\" at the time). In fact they became the first team in the competition's history to win it back to back. The 1994\u201395 final saw Bromsgrove involved in a high scoring 10\u20132 aggregate victory over Kettering Town. In the 1995\u201396 final Rovers beat Macclesfield Town 4\u20132 on aggregate.

The club was already feeling the effects of the dramatic social changes of the 1960s, in the form of falling attendances and the end of the players' maximum wage. Hagan, despite the spirit of the times, was a martinet on the training ground and frequently bred conflict with a playing squad that was beginning to enjoy the new economic and social freedoms. However, he shrewdly built the team in personnel and skill, leading them to a League Cup triumph in 1966 as Albion (in their first League Cup appearance) beat West Ham 5\u20133 on aggregate in the last two-legged final.
