After completing a puzzle for the first time, he set about creating two of his own to send to his hero John Galbraith Graham, known as \"Araucaria\", and accomplished this two and a half years later. He now writes three or four a week for a variety of publications.Having studied music and maths, Halpern became a local reporter, barman, warehouse packer, bank clerk and lab technician. He taught English in Rome, but found that hands-on examples of the present continuous kept causing him to lead his students out of the classroom, on to the street and into bars where he would put their understanding of his lesson to the test: \u2018You are buying me a drink\u2019.Halpern\u2019s favourite clue of his own is \"To make cheese, how do you milk a Welsh hedgehog? (10)\" (answer: CAERPHILLY). The first clue he ever wrote for the Guardian was \"Name sewn into footballers' underwear (8)\" (answer: KNICKERS \u2013 N for name, in KICKERS).In March 2012, Halpern and Graham hosted a crossword show at The Guardian offices. He is working on a film and follow-up tour.Halpern lives with his wife Taline, near the East Sussex coast.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cryptic crossword", "response": [":The Telegraph, like the Times, does not identify the setter of each puzzle but, unlike the Times, has a regular setter for each day of the week, plus a few occasional setters to cover holidays or sickness.
