While the motion was not expected to pass, the margin of its defeat (243 to 362) was much wider than expected. Later in the same Parliament, the Criminal Justice Bill provided an opportunity on 11 May 1982 for several new clauses to be proposed which would have reinstated capital punishment. The first, which simply declared that \"A person convicted of murder shall be liable to capital punishment\", was tabled by Edward Gardner, and rejected by 195 to 357. It was followed by an alternative under which capital punishment would be available \"as the penalty for an act of terrorism involving the loss of human life\"; this new clause was rejected by 176 to 332. A further new clause proposing capital punishment \"as the penalty for murder by means of firearms or explosives\" was rejected by 176 to 343. Then a new clause allowing for capital punishment \"as the penalty for murder of a police or prison officer\" was rejected by 208 to 332. Finally a new clause allowing capital punishment \"as the penalty for murder in the course of robbery and burglary which involves the use of offensive weapons\" was rejected by 151 to 331."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "Minister for Sport and Civil Society", "response": ["| width=200|Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "Bury St Edmunds (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "Heath ministry", "response": ["|rowspan=8|Under-Secretary of State, Environment||Eldon Griffiths||15 October 1970 \u2013 4 March 1974||\u00a0", "|rowspan=3|Parliamentary Secretary, Housing and Local Government||Eldon Griffiths||23 June 1970 \u2013 15 October 1970||rowspan=3|Part of Environment from Oct 1970"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Eldon Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Eldon Griffiths; MP for Bury St Edmunds (1964\u20131992)"]}, {"page": "Moor Allerton", "response": ["In the late 1960s land was purchased on Blackmoor Farm and the Nursery Lane site was sold for housing.
