It was translated into English in 1971. Davies says 1920's Rois et Serfs, (Kings and Serfs), is a \"long and rather meandering essay\", although it had the potential to be Bloch's definitive monograph upon the single topic that \"might have evoked his genius at his fullest\", the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages. Loyn also describes it as a \"loose-knit monograph\", and a program to move forward rather than a full-length academic text."]}, {"page": "Mortimer Wheeler", "response": ["In 1924, the Director of the National Museum of Wales, William Evans Hoyle, resigned amid ill health. Wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement, providing supportive testimonials from Charles Reed Peers, Robert Bosanquet, and H. J. Fleure. Although he had no prior museum experience, he was successful in his application and was appointed director. He then employed a close friend, Cyril Fox, to take on the vacated position of Keeper of Archaeology. Wheeler's proposed reforms included extending the institution's reach and influence throughout Wales by building affiliations with regional museums, and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises. He obtained a \u00a321,367 donation from the wealthy shipowner William Reardon Smith and appointed Smith to be the museum's treasurer, and also travelled to Whitehall, London, where he successfully urged the British Treasury to provide further funding for the museum. As a result, construction on the museum's new building was able to continue, and it was officially opened by King George V in 1927."]}, {"page": "E. G. Bowen", "response": ["*Professor H. J.
