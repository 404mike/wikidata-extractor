Lord Chancellor Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington, was his great-grandfather. He succeeded his father as third Baron Henley in 1841 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. He was instead elected to the House of Commons for Northampton in 1859, a seat he held until 1874. In 1885 the Northington title held by his great-grandfather was revived when he was created Baron Northington, of Watford in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him and the later Barons an automatic seat in the House of Lords.\nHe was appointed High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1854.\nLord Henley married, firstly, Julia Emily Augusta, daughter of the Very Reverend John Peel, Dean of Worcester, in 1846. After her death in 1862 he married, secondly, Clara Campbell Lucy, daughter of Joseph H. S. Jekyll, in 1870. He died in November 1898, aged 73, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son Frederick. Lady Henley died in 1922.", "link_mentions": {}}}
