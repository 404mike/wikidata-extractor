Its inquiry, led by barrister Charles Geekie QC, was also critical of former assistant manager Gradi. He was accused of failing to tell senior club staff about a sexual conduct allegation concerning Heath made by the parent of a young player. Gradi denied trying to \"smooth over\" the matter in a meeting with the boy's father and said he had reported the allegations to Chelsea manager Ron Suart. Gradi was accused by Geekie of giving \"somewhat unlikely and unconvincing\" evidence; Geekie also rejected Gradi's claim to have reported the matter to more senior staff, saying \"this was a significant personal failure by Mr Gradi. It was a lost opportunity to expose Mr Heath and prevent further abuse.\"", "The FA's 700-page Sheldon report was published on 17 March 2021, identifying failures to act adequately on complaints or rumours of sexual abuse at eight professional clubs including Crewe. Considering whether senior club people knew about Bennell, Sheldon concluded they had not received specific reports of abuse (a conclusion also reached by Cheshire constabulary). However, Norman Rowlinson, John Bowler and Hamilton Smith had discussed concerns about inappropriate behaviour; \"... during Bennell's time at the Club, there were rumours circulating about [Bennell] and his sexual interest in children which were heard by some of the Club's staff, including Dario Gradi.\" The club \"should have done more to check on the well-being of the boys\", Sheldon said. Regarding the Chelsea allegations, Sheldon could not decide whether Gradi had informed the club's acting manager, Ron Suart, of concerns raised at a meeting with the player's father, but, either way, Sheldon said Gradi's or Suart's responses were inadequate. The FA's CEO Mark Bullingham said Gradi was \"effectively banned for life\" from football; the FA legal director said it was \"for safeguarding reasons\" but that was \"as far as we can go\". Child abuse survivors charity The Offside Trust called for Gradi to be stripped of his MBE, and for the Professional Footballers' Association and Football Hall of Fame to revoke other honours."]}, {"page": "Blackpool F.C.", "response": ["Smith was succeeded, in May 1958, by Ron Suart, the first former Tangerine to return to the club as manager.
