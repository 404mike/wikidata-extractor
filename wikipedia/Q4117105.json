The three men were working for Gulf Supplies and Commercial Services, a Kuwaiti company working on reconstruction projects in Iraq. The men knew their home was being watched and realised they were in great danger when their Iraqi house guard informed them he was leaving due to threats by militias for protecting American and British workers. \nBigley and the two Americans decided it was worth the risk and continued to live in the house. All were subsequently kidnapped and later murdered by beheading.\nOn 18 September, the Tawhid and Jihad (\"Oneness of God and Jihad\") Islamic extremist group, led by Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, released a video of the three men kneeling in front of a Tawhid and Jihad banner. The kidnappers said they would kill the men within 48 hours if their demands for the release of Iraqi women prisoners held by coalition forces were not met. Armstrong was killed on 20 September when the deadline expired, Hensley 24 hours later, and Bigley over two weeks later, despite the attempted intervention of the Muslim Council of Britain and the indirect intervention of the British government. Videos of the killings were posted on websites and blogs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ken Bigley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kidnapping and murder of Kenneth Bigley"]}, {"page": "Kenneth bigley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kidnapping and murder of Kenneth Bigley"]}, {"page": "Ken bigly", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kidnapping and murder of Kenneth Bigley"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Bigleyand", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kidnapping and murder of Kenneth Bigley"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2004", "response": ["*Kenneth Bigley, 62, British civil engineer taken hostage in Iraq, beheaded by hostage takers."]}, {"page": "Abduction and death of Kenneth Bigley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kidnapping and murder of Kenneth Bigley"]}, {"page": "List of solved missing person cases: post-2000", "response": ["|Kenneth Bigley", "|Kenneth Bigley was a British civil engineer, who together with his American colleagues Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, was kidnapped by Islamist militants from Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in Baghdad, Iraq.
