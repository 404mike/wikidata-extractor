She was born in Spain and educated at Godolphin School, Salisbury and Newnham College, Cambridge. In her early career, she worked for Penguin Books and Red Cross Geneva. Between 1956 and 1966, she was film critic of The Spectator. She served as literary editor of The Tablet from 1985 to 1997. She has also contributed to numerous journals and newspapers, and served on the jury of various literary prizes including the Booker Prize jury in 1986.Her first book, and only novel, The Eye of Heaven, was published in 1953. Other books include The Heirs of Tom Brown: The English School Story and Charlie Chaplin: Early Comedies. She has also translated more than 100 books from Italian, Spanish and French. Her most notable translations are Silvano Ceccherini's The Transfer, for which, in 1967, she won the John Florio Prize, and Giorgio Bassani's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis. According to Robin Healey's Twentieth-Century Italian Literature in English Translation, Quigly was one of the top 10 translators of Italian literature of the last 70 years, alongside Archibald Colquhoun, Patrick Creagh, Angus Davidson, Frances Frenaye, Stuart Hood, Eric Mosbacher, Raymond Rosenthal, Bernard Wall and William Weaver.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Italo Svevo", "response": ["* Livia Veneziani Svevo, Memoir of Italo Svevo, Preface by P.

Franju responded to these comments claiming the film was his attempt to get the minor genre to be taken seriously. In England, Isabel Quigly, film critic for The Spectator, called it \"the sickest film since I started film criticism\", while a reviewer who admitted that she liked the film was nearly fired. A review in Variety was negative, noting specifically that the \"stilted acting, asides to explain characters and motivations, and a repetition of effects lose the initial impact\" and an \"unclear progression and plodding direction give [the film] an old-fashioned air\". The English Monthly Film Bulletin was of the opinion that \"when a director as distinguished as Georges Franju makes a horror film...one cannot but feel tempted to search for symbols, an allegory, layers, or interpretation. Unhappily there is practically nothing in this inept work to offer any encouragement for doing so.\" The review said there was \"a strange and poetic opening\" and Schuftan's \"haunting camerawork allies itself perfectly to Maurice Jarre's obsessive score\" while\" Brasseur and Valli were \"sadly wasted\" and that they \"do what they can with almost non-existent characters\"."]}, {"page": "Natalia Ginzburg", "response": ["* Mai devi domandarmi (1970).
