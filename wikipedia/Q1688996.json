As Director of the BIAA Gough pioneered the archaeology of early Christian sites in Turkey in anticipation of changes in academic viewpoints which were to follow in the 1990s.Gough attended the Dragon School in Oxford before gaining a scholarship to Stonyhurst College where he concentrated on studying the Classics. In 1936 he gained a Classical Exhibition to Peterhouse, Cambridge where he went on to become a Scholar and Prizeman. In 1939 he gained a First Class Honours Degree in the Classical Tripos with Archaeology as his specialism. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Gough joined the Royal Artillery as a Gunner, seeing service in the Middle East and throughout the whole of the Italian Campaign including during the battles of Cassino and on the Sangro. He was discharged from the Army in Germany in the Spring of 1946 with the rank of Major. In 1946 he married Dorothy Mary n\u00e9e Ormsby; together they took part in various excavations.On being demobilised in September 1946 Gough returned to Stonyhurst College as Classics Master and in 1947 he returned to the University of Cambridge to take a Diploma in Classical Archaeology. He was awarded a Scholarship by the recently founded British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara becoming the Institute's second Scholar and later becoming a Fellow. Arriving in Ankara in February 1949 he began to study the classical antiquities at Cilicia. From then until 1951 Gough was almost continually at Ankara as well as Cilicia. He became a fluent speaker of Turkish.In 1961 Gough succeeded Seton Lloyd to become the third Director of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara (BIAA). He had a focus on the Byzantine period, with excavations at the church complex at Alahan Monastery (between 1952 and 1972 Gough directed nine seasons of excavation here) and at Da\u011f Pazar\u0131.  Gough's involvement at Alahan was an important departure from the specialisms of his predecessors in prehistoric archaeology; from this period onwards the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara began to broaden its academic horizons. Among his scholarly researches were the later history of Anazarbus and the iconoclast decoration at Aloda. During his Directorship the BIAA made one of its most important discoveries at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck.  Michael Gough retired as Director of the BIAA in 1968. He was a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey from 1968 to 1969.Following his retirement Gough lived in Kingswear in Devon. He died suddenly in Toronto in Canada in 1973. His final excavation programme at Alahan Monastery in Turkey was completed in 1972 before his death but the report was not published until 1985 by his widow, Mary Gough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gough", "response": ["*Michael Gough (1916\u20132011), English actor", "*Michael Gough (1916\u20131973), archaeologist", "*Michael Gough (born 1956), American voice actor"]}, {"page": "World of Art", "response": ["| The Origins of Christian Art || Michael Gough || 1973"]}, {"page": "List of Old Stonyhursts", "response": ["*Michael Gough, archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Seton Lloyd", "response": ["After education at Uppingham School, Lloyd studied at the Architectural Association in London and qualified as an architect in 1926.

In 1930 Lloyd was invited by Frankfort to join latter's next excavation, under the auspices of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, of a series of sites in the Diyala valley (1930\u20131937). In 1937\u20131939 he excavated with John Garstang at Mersin, in southern Turkey, for the University of Liverpool. In 1939 Lloyd was appointed Archaeological Adviser to the Directorate of Antiquities in Iraq, where he helped to establish the Iraq Museum and reorganize the Gertrude Bell Museum. He trained Iraqi archaeologists and participated with Iraqi colleagues in several major excavations, notably at \u2018Uqair and Eridu, at Assyrian Khorsabad, the Aqueduct of Sennacherib at Jerwan. He succeeded Max Mallowan as the President of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. In 1948, he became Director of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara. He excavated with, among others, James Mellaart, one of the first scholars at the Ankara School, the mound at Beycesultan, in western Anatolia, and also conducted excavations at Polatli, Haran, Sultantepe and other Anatolian sites.

Headlam, who wrote an exhaustive article which gives meticulous detail to the monastic complex as well as the church located at the east end. Headlam postulated that Alahan may be a known as the Byzantine monastery Apadna, which was restored during Justinians reign, however, Michael Gough states Alahan shows no signs of restoration to support this premise.Some Recent Finds at Alahan (Koja Kalessi), Michael Gough, Anatolian Studies, 119.", "*Gough, M.
