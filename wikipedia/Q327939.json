Within a few minutes of the bombing, Barker translated this instruction into an order that \"all Jewish places of entertainment, cafes, restaurants, shops and private dwellings\" be out of bounds to all ranks. He concluded, \"I appreciate that these measures will inflict some hardship on the troops, but I am certain that if my reasons are fully explained to them, they will understand their propriety and they will be punishing the Jews in a way the race dislikes as much as any, by striking at their pockets and showing our contempt of them.\" The future Israeli diplomat Abba Eban, then an officer in the British Army, leaked the order to the press.
