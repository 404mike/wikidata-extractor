Isen disparaged what she regarded as an overly explanatory style, particularly when performed, as \"the belated imposition of rhythm\" fails to conceal compositional shortcomings. Carl Wilson and Khaira-Hanks argued that her mainstream success and personal identity contributed towards people disregarding her work.
