He also assisted in the development of recording practices like overdubbing, sampling and reverberation. Meek is considered one of the most influential sound engineers of all time, being one of the first to develop ideas such as the recording studio as an instrument, and becoming one of the first producers to be recognised for his individual identity as an artist.Charting singles Meek produced for other artists include \"Johnny Remember Me\" (John Leyton, 1961), \"Just Like Eddie\" (Heinz, 1963), \"Angela Jones\" (Michael Cox, 1960), \"Have I the Right?\" (the Honeycombs, 1964), and \"Tribute to Buddy Holly\" (Mike Berry, 1961). The Tornados' instrumental \"Telstar\" (1962), written and produced by Meek, became the first record by a British rock group to reach number one in the US Hot 100. It also spent five weeks at number one in the UK singles chart, with Meek receiving an Ivor Novello Award for this production as the \"Best-Selling A-Side\" of 1962. He also produced music for films such as Live It Up! (US title Sing and Swing, 1963), a pop music film.  Meek's concept album I Hear a New World (1960), which contains innovative use of electronic sounds, was not fully released in his lifetime.\nHis reputation for experiments in recording music was acknowledged by the Music Producers Guild who in 2009 created \"The Joe Meek Award for Innovation in Production\" as a \"homage to [the] remarkable producer's pioneering spirit\". In 2014, Meek was ranked the greatest producer of all time by NME, elaborating: \"Meek was a complete trailblazer, attempting endless new ideas in his search for the perfect sound. ... The legacy of his endless experimentation is writ large over most of your favourite music today.\"At the time of his death, Meek possessed thousands of unreleased recordings later dubbed \"The Tea Chest Tapes\". His commercial success as a producer was short-lived, and he gradually sank into debt and depression. On 3 February 1967, using a shotgun owned by musician Heinz Burt, Meek killed his landlady, Violet Shenton, and then shot himself.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 5", "response": ["*  1929   \u2013 Joe Meek, English songwriter and producer (d. 1967)"]}, {"page": "February 3", "response": ["*1967 \u2013 Joe Meek, English songwriter and producer (b. 1929)"]}, {"page": "Modernism", "response": ["In the 1960s, as popular music began to gain cultural importance and question its status as commercial entertainment, musicians began to look to the post-war avant-garde for inspiration. In 1959, music producer Joe Meek recorded I Hear a New World (1960), which Tiny Mix Tapes Jonathan Patrick calls a \"seminal moment in both electronic music and avant-pop history [...] a collection of dreamy pop vignettes, adorned with dubby echoes and tape-warped sonic tendrils\" which would be largely ignored at the time. Other early avant-pop productions included the Beatles's 1966 song \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", which incorporated techniques from musique concr\u00e8te, avant-garde composition, Indian music, and electro-acoustic sound manipulation into a 3-minute pop format, and the Velvet Underground's integration of La Monte Young's minimalist and drone music ideas, beat poetry, and 1960s pop art."]}, {"page": "Psychedelic rock", "response": ["Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to \"pin down\" the first psychedelic record are \"nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record\". Some of the \"far-fetched claims\" include the instrumental \"Telstar\" (produced by Joe Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five's \"massively reverb-laden\" \"Any Way You Want It\" (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers' 1960 surf instrumental \"LSD 25\". A 1962 single by the Ventures, \"The 2000 Pound Bee\", issued forth the buzz of a distorted, \"fuzztone\" guitar, and the quest into \"the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion\" and other effects, like improved reverb and echo began in earnest on London's fertile rock 'n' roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in \"I Feel Fine\", their sixth consecutive number 1 hit in the UK."]}, {"page": "Pop music", "response": ["In the 1960s,  the majority of mainstream pop music fell in two categories: guitar, drum and bass groups or singers backed by a traditional orchestra. Since early in the decade, it was common for pop producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados. At the same time, pop music on radio and in both American and British film moved away from refined Tin Pan Alley to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverb-drenched rock guitar, symphonic strings, and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians.  A 2019 study held by New York University in which 643 participants had to rank how familiar a pop song is to them, songs from the 1960s turned out to be the most memorable, significantly more than songs from recent years 2000 to 2015."]}, {"page": "Rock and roll", "response": ["Some music historians have also pointed to important and innovative developments that built on rock and roll in this period, including multitrack recording, developed by Les Paul, the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek, and the \"Wall of Sound\" productions of Phil Spector, continued desegregation of the charts, the rise of surf music, garage rock and the Twist dance craze. Surf rock in particular, noted for the use of reverb-drenched guitars, became one of the most popular forms of American rock of the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Rock music", "response": ["Also significant was the advent of soul music as a major commercial force. Developing out of rhythm and blues with a re-injection of gospel music and pop, led by pioneers like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke from the mid-1950s, by the early 1960s figures like Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder were dominating the R&B charts and breaking through into the main pop charts, helping to accelerate their desegregation, while Motown and Stax/Volt Records were becoming major forces in the record industry.R.

According to Jones himself, his young voice was a tenor voice. He said: \"What you lose on the top end, you gain on the bottom end. I used to be able to hit a top C when I was young now it's a B flat.\" He became the frontman in 1963 for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a Welsh beat group. They soon gained a local following and reputation in South Wales. In 1964, the group recorded several solo tracks with producer Joe Meek, who took them to various record labels, but they had little success. Later that year, Decca producer Peter Sullivan saw Tommy Scott and the Senators performing in a club and directed them to manager Phil Solomon, but the partnership was short-lived."]}, {"page": "Record producer", "response": ["Across the 1960s, popular music increasingly switched from acoustic instruments, like piano, upright bass, acoustic guitar, and brass instruments, to electronic instruments, like electric guitars, keyboards, and synthesizers, employing instrument amplifiers and speakers. These could mimic acoustic instruments or create utterly new sounds. Soon, by combining the capabilities of tape, multitrack recording, and electronic instruments, producers like Phil Spector, George Martin, and Joe Meek rendered sounds unattainable live. Similarly, in jazz fusion, Teo Macero, producing Miles Davis's 1970 album Bitches Brew, spliced sections of extensive improvisation sessions."]}, {"page": "Humphrey Lyttelton", "response": ["In the late 1940s and early 1950s Lyttelton was prominent in the British revival of traditional jazz forms from New Orleans, recording with Sidney Bechet in 1949. To do so he had to break with the Musicians' Union restrictive practices which forbade working with jazz musicians from the United States. In 1956, he had his only pop chart hit, with the Joe Meek-produced recording of \"Bad Penny Blues\", which was in the UK Singles Chart for six weeks."]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["The sessions for Revolver furthered the spirit of studio experimentation evident on Rubber Soul. With the Beatles increasingly involved in the production of their music, Martin's role as producer had changed to one of a facilitator and collaborator, whereby the band now relied on him to make their ideas a reality. According to Rodriguez, Revolver marked the first time the Beatles integrated studio technology into the \"conception of the recordings they made\". He views this approach as reflective of the group's waning interest in live performance before crowds of screaming fans, \"in favor of creating soundscapes without limitation\" in a studio environment. For the first time at EMI Studios, the company's four-track tape machines were placed in the studio's control room, alongside the producer and balance engineer, rather than in a dedicated machine room. The Beatles' new recording engineer on the project was nineteen-year-old Geoff Emerick, whom author and critic Ian MacDonald describes as an \"English audio experimentalist\" in the tradition of Joe Meek. Emerick recalled that no preproduction or rehearsal process took place for Revolver; instead, the band used the studio to create each song from what was often just an outline of a composition. Speaking shortly before the start of the sessions, Lennon said that they had considered making the album a continuous flow of tracks, without gaps to differentiate between each song."]}, {"page": "Henry Cowell", "response": ["Cowell's interest in harmonic rhythm, as discussed in New Musical Resources, led him in 1930 to commission L\u00e9on Theremin to invent the Rhythmicon, or Polyrhythmophone, a transposable keyboard instrument capable of playing notes in periodic rhythms proportional to the overtone series of a chosen fundamental pitch. The world's first electronic rhythm machine, with a photoreceptor-based sound production system proposed by Cowell (not a theremin-like system, as some sources incorrectly state), it could produce up to sixteen different rhythmic patterns simultaneously, complete with optional syncopation. Cowell wrote several original compositions for the instrument, including an orchestrated concerto, and Theremin built two more models. Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when progressive pop music producer Joe Meek experimented with its rhythmic concept."]}, {"page": "Outsider music", "response": ["Outsider music does not generally include avant-garde music, world music, songs recorded solely for their novelty value, or anything self-consciously camp or kitsch; Chusid uses the term \"incorrect music\" for music that is intentionally recorded to draw bad reactions, from non-musician celebrity entertainers attempting to cross over into music, or from artists who are talented and self-aware enough not to produce such music but do so anyway. Works are usually sourced from home recordings or independent recording studios \"with no quality control\". In Songs in the Key of Z, Chusid explicitly avoided discussing \"unpopular\", \"uncommercial\", or \"underground\" artists, and disqualified \"just about anyone who could keep an orchestra or band together.\" He did include a few acts in the definition that broke through to mainstream fame as novelty acts; Tiny Tim, for example, is included despite a consistent three-decade career in the music industry that included a major chart hit, Joe Meek was one of the United Kingdom's most influential and successful sound engineers of the 1960s, and the Legendary Stardust Cowboy had a brief moment of widespread fame in the 1960s with several national television appearances."]}, {"page": "Holloway, London", "response": ["* Joe Meek (5 April 1929 \u2013 3 February 1967), record producer, sound engineer, songwriter, and audio inventor; lived, worked and died at 304 Holloway Road N7."]}, {"page": "Hayes, Hillingdon", "response": ["* Honey Lantree (1943-2018), celebrated female drummer of Joe Meek-produced sixties pop group The Honeycombs, was born in Hayes."]}, {"page": "Rod Stewart", "response": ["Stewart worked in the family shop and as a newspaper delivery boy.Ewbank and Hildred, Rod Stewart: The New Biography, pp. 12\u201313.

Prince used the technique on several of his songs, as well as Frank Zappa on We're Only in It for the Money and on the instrumental album Hot Rats, among others. The early production style of hip-hop artist Kanye West involved sped-up, high-pitch vocal samples from classic soul records incorporated with his own (additional) instrumentation.
