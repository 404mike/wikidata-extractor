Thompson Brown, Christianity in the People's Republic of China, rev. ed. (Atlanta, GA: John Knox Press, 1986), 124. From 1973 the Christian faith began to spread rapidly in some parts of China.Alan Hunter and Kim-Kwong Chan, Protestantism in Contemporary China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 68 Because the TSPM had itself been disbanded in 1966, this spread took place entirely underground, that is, without government interference. Many \"house churches\" sprang up, as well as many home meetings associated with local churches organized along the lines of the teachings of Watchman Nee.Britt Towery, Christianity in Today's China (The Tao Foundation Missionary Heritage Edition, 2000).Leslie T. Lyall, New Spring in China (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1980).Tony Lambert, The Resurrection of the Chinese Church (Wheaton, IL: Harold Shaw, 1994). However, in the absence of Bibles and other Christian literature, parts of China, especially more rural areas, became breeding grounds for the development of novel belief systems mixing elements of Christianity with Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and local folk beliefs and practices.\"Problems in Henan: Reports from Itinerant Preachers,\" China and the Church Today 4:2 (1982):2-3.", "In 1950 Zhou Enlai worked with Y. T. Wu to craft \"The Christian Manifesto\" declaring that Protestants in China would support the new government and reject foreign imperialism. Such initiatives led to the establishment of the TSPM which promoted the \"three-self principles\" of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. Shortly afterwards a widespread accusation/denouncement campaign began which led to the expulsion of foreign missionaries and to the arrest and imprisonment of many indigenous Chinese Christians as counterrevolutionaries, including prominent Christian teachers such as Watchman Nee and Wang Mingdao.Lyall, Leslie (1977), \"The Chinese Christian Church under Communism\u20141949\u20131966\", in Aikman, David, Love China Today, Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House, 53.Bob Whyte, Unfinished Encounter: China and Christianity (London, Fount Paperbacks, 1988), 219\u201328.  The CCP had a deep mistrust of any leader or movement with a significant following, including religious ones, partly due to the prominent place of the religiously motivated Taiping Rebellion in China's relatively recent past.Michael Dillon, Religious Minorities and China (London: Minority Rights Group International, 2001), 23.Tony Lambert, \"The Present Religious Policy of the Chinese Communist Party,\" Religion, State & Society 29:2, 2001:121. The CCP itself had first gained traction in China by mobilizing small groups of peasants in rural areas and had grown in strength until it was able to topple the Kuomintang from power.", "In response to the revisionist reports, Tony Lambert, a former British diplomat to China who joined the Overseas Missionary Fellowship (formerly the China Inland Mission), translated a paper titled \"The Lord in China: The Dongyang Yiwu Persecution: Another View.\" The paper said, \"In reality, we have sufficient evidence to show that the persecuted underground church at Dongyang & Yiwu does not belong to the \u2018Local Church\u2019 of Li Changshou or to the \u2018screamers sect\u2019.\"\"The Lord in China: The Dongyang Yiwu Persecution: Another View,\" translated by Tony Lambert, December 1982. This account was repeated and confirmed by the CCRC in Don't Forget About China in December 1982 and in the January/February issue of China and the Church.Don't Forget About China, December 1982.China and the Church 26, January/February 1983.", "Most recent Western sources follow the version of events reported by the members of the Ecumenical China Study Liaison Group, which echoed the TSPM's portrayal of \"the Shouters sect\" as a cultic offshoot of the local churches.. This may be due, in part, to the book-length treatments of the history of the church in China written by former Ecumenical China Study Liaison Group participants Bob Whyte, Edmond Tang, and Philip Wickeri.Bob Whyte, Unfinished Encounter: China and Christianity (London: Fount Paperbacks, 1988), 406\u20138.Philip L.

However, Tony Lambert later reported that TSPM Chairman Ding Guangxun, who had initially blamed \"the Shouters sect\" for inciting the unrest,Ding Guangxun, \"A Talk with the Shouters,\" Collected Sermons, Vol. 5, May 1983. admitted in 1987 that \"local TSPM strong-arm tactics had been responsible for the incidents\" at Dongyang and Yiwu.Tony Lambert, The Resurrection of the Chinese Church (Wheaton, IL: Harold Shaw Publishers, 1994), 84.", "The Dongyang/Yiwu incidents had occurred against a backdrop of widespread civil unrest in the PRC. Crime had become a serious problem, something of a residue of the Cultural Revolution.The October and November 1983 issues of Zheng Ming contain several articles describing the Anti-Crime Campaign; its association with the persecution of Christians is discussed in \"The Ins and Outs of the Persecution of the Church,\" China Watch 60, May/June 1984. The economic reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping reduced duplication of workers, resulting in a substantial number of workers being displaced.Richard Baum, \"The Fall and Rise of China, Lecture 38: The Fault Lines of Reform, 1984\u20131987\" (Chantilly, VA: The Teaching Company, 2010). When an Anti-Crime Campaign began in August 1983, the wave of persecutions that had already begun after the Dongyang/Yiwu incidents was quickly subsumed under it. Government entities at various levels issued proclamations outlawing \"the Shouters sect\" as a criminal cult.Xiangshan County People's Government in Zhejiang Province, \"Notice on the Suppression of the Reactionary \u2018Shouters\u2019 Organization,\" August 15, 1983; Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, \"Notice Concerning Arresting the Counter-revolutionary Group \u2018The Shouters\u2019,\" December 1, 1983. Leaders of the local churches using publications of Witness Lee were targeted for arrest,Overseas Missionary Fellowship, Pray for China Fellowship, December 1983.China Prayer Letter 39, December 1983. but many unregistered house church leaders were also incarcerated.China Prayer Letter 38, November 1983. Several sources have noted that \"the Shouters sect\" was applied broadly to any Christian group which refused to join TSPM.Chinese Church Research Centre (CCRC), China Prayer Letter 48, September 1984.David H. Adeney, China: The Church's Long March (Ventura, CA: Regal Books, 1985), 159.Tony Lambert, China's Christian Millions (London: Monarch Books, 2000), 81.Human Rights Watch, China: State Control of Religion (New York: Human Rights Watch, 1997), 31. Jonathan Chao of the CCRC speculated that Tang and Ren's book \"may be TSPM's way of isolating Li's group from other Christians, and it will probably be effective since evangelical house church leaders in China will not support Li against the TSPM.\"Jonathan Chao, China News and Church Report 8, June 10, 1983."]}, {"page": "World Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth", "response": ["* 1970-1973  Tony Lambert"]}]}}
