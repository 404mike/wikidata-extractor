Alcott died from a heart attack in Cannes, France, in July 1986; he was 55.

To achieve photography without electric lighting \"[f]or the many densely furnished interior scenes\u2026 meant shooting by candlelight,\" which is known to be difficult in still photography, \"let alone with moving images.\"", "| John Alcott", "| John Alcott"]}, {"page": "Stanley Kubrick", "response": ["Baxter notes that Barry Lyndon was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous attention to detail, often demanding twenty or thirty retakes of the same scene to perfect his art. Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott used in Barry Lyndon were highly innovative. Interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 Zeiss camera lens originally developed for NASA to be used in satellite photography. The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. Cinematographer Allen Daviau states that the method gives the audience a way of seeing the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a \"sense of documentary realism and immediacy\".", "Kubrick credited the ease with which he filmed scenes to his early years as a photographer. He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as \"a detective\". Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography on Barry Lyndon, remarked that Kubrick \"questions everything\", and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the \"nearest thing to genius I've ever worked with, with all the problems of a genius\"."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Cinematography", "response": ["| John Alcott", "| John Alcott"]}, {"page": "1986 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 28 || John Alcott || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 55 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Cinematographer || "]}, {"page": "No Way Out (1987 film)", "response": ["Exteriors were shot on location in Baltimore, Annapolis, Arlington, Washington, D.C., and Auckland, New Zealand, between April 1986 and June 1986.

Unsworth was especially in demand as cinematographer in two very different genres, period pieces and science fiction. Among the highlights of his career, he collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the visually innovative 2001: A Space Odyssey (on which he was assisted by John Alcott, who would become a regular collaborator of Kubrick's) and Bob Fosse's dark musical exploration of the end of Weimar Germany, Cabaret. In Sidney Lumet's 1974 film adaptation of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, his lighting and use of diffusion capture the danger and romance of the train while graceful integration of camera movement and optical effects contributes to the realism of the set while controlling the claustrophobia of the setting."]}]}}
