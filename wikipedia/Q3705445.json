In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for \u00a3200.

These misidentifications lingered, despite Posner's outright rejection of them in 1971, when he named the subject of the Lute Player as a member of the Mascheroni family of Bologna, based on Carlo Cesare Malvasia's description of the sitter in his 1678 book Felsina Pittrice.Posner 1971, vol. 2, p. 32; Malvasia 1678, vol. 1, p. 502: \"del sonatore Mascheroni tanto suo [Annibale's] famigliare, & amico\".
