McCracken, who played as a central defender, was a Scotland under-21 internationalist, having made five appearances at that level between 2001 and 2003. McCracken started his career with Dundee United in the Scottish Premier League and was a first team player there for seven years before leaving in May 2007. He subsequently played in England for Football League clubs Wycombe Wanderers, Milton Keynes Dons and Brentford before returning to Scotland with St Johnstone in 2011. He joined Falkirk in August 2013, playing with the club for four seasons, before finishing his playing career with Peterhead.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gary Holt (footballer)", "response": ["Holt returned to Falkirk in January 2021 as their sporting director.

New signing Morgaro Gomis made a late debut with Irishman Jon Daly becoming Levein's next signing, the big target man arriving from Hartlepool United on 5 January. The following day, Levein confirmed Grant Smith's contract would not be renewed but Sean Dillon's move from Shelbourne was eventually completed, with the Irish full back arriving on 11 January. Prior to this, a flu epidemic had seen the Scottish Cup game against St Mirren postponed. The after-effects may have been present as United slumped to a 5\u20130 defeat at Ibrox, with Daly and Dillon both making debuts. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that Inverness captain Darren Dods had signed a pre-contract agreement to join in the summer, ending a lengthy pursuit for him that had been started by former manager Craig Brewster some months previously. The re-arranged cup match against St Mirren was full of excitement, with United throwing away a two-goal lead before David Robertson secured the win with an injury-time winner. United lost a third consecutive league match, going down 1\u20130 at Rugby Park, with David McCracken \u2013 who had earlier been told he would be leaving in the summer \u2013 absent. Shortly afterwards, Alan Archibald and David Proctor were also informed they were free to leave. January's final match resulted in a disappointing goalless draw at home to Dunfermline.", "April began in emphatic fashion, with a 4\u20132 win at Aberdeen which saw five goals in the opening seventeen minutes; Greg Cameron's first goals for United were enough to clinch victory. United entered the league split with an away match at Dunfermline and continued their winless streak that stretched back to 1997, losing 1\u20130. The following week, David Robertson's goal earned a 1\u20131 draw at home to Inverness, although it later transpired Jon Daly's knee injury was posterior cruciate ligament damage and would rule him out for several months. On the same day, United's proposed pre-season fixture with Barcelona was confirmed, before St Mirren eased their relegation worries with a 2\u20130 weekend win at Tannadice. The penultimate match of the season saw a third straight loss for United, going down 2\u20130 at Falkirk; earlier in the week, Derek Stillie confirmed he would leave the club at the end of the season to pursue an English law career. Collin Samuel was not far behind, although due to the club deciding not to offer a new contract. The Falkirk defeat also saw another d\u00e9but for a youngster with Johnny Russell making a late substitute appearance. The season finished with a 0\u20130 home draw against Motherwell. It was the final game for Derek Stillie, David McCracken, Lee Mair and Collin Samuel, who each started the match."]}, {"page": "Lee Wilkie", "response": ["Following his spell at Ross County, Wilkie returned to Dundee United and played in a 1\u20130 defeat to Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on 20 January 2007. After the match, Wilkie cast doubt on his future at Tannadice by expressing doubts over his ability to play in the SPL due to his ongoing injury and fitness issues, and stated he will review his situation in the near future. Wilkie, like defensive colleagues David McCracken and Lee Mair, was to be out of contract at the end of 2006\u201307, but signed a two-year deal in March 2007 to take him to summer 2009."]}, {"page": "Lourdes Secondary School", "response": ["* David McCracken, footballer"]}]}}
