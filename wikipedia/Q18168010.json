During the war she became disillusioned with the women's movement, since many of its members supported the fighting. She suffered from recurrent physical and mental illness after the war, and ended her life in a mental hospital.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Woman's Century", "response": ["In April 1918 Woman's Century ran several stories on the lowering of moral standards caused by the war. There were said to be millions of illegitimate children in Germany. France was trying to reduce venereal disease by licensing and regulating prostitution. Gertrude Richardson wrote \"war and militarism are the bitterest of all foes of womanhood, wifehood, motherhood and the home\". However, she said this was just one of the results of war. Unlike other feminist writers, she did not blame the soldiers or the loose women who tempted them. She wrote \"Shall we who drive them to the hell of war condemn their departure from our standard of morals? Ours is the responsibility, not only for the blighted purity, but for the maimed forms, the shattered brains, the sightless eyes.\""]}, {"page": "Harriet Dunlop Prenter", "response": ["Prenter wrote regularly for Canadian Forward, which reported on labour and socialist topics and published feminist and pacifist material for about 30,000 readers. Her articles also appeared in the White Ribbon Bulletin and Woman's Century. She may have encouraged Gertrude Richardson to contribute to Canadian Forward from June 1917 onward."]}, {"page": "Maternal feminism", "response": ["There was also a natural link between pacifism and maternal feminism. Augusta Stowe-Gullen (1857\u20131943) said in 1915 that \"when women have a voice in national and international affairs, war will cease forever.\" This became an increasingly hard position to support as World War I dragged on. Some who stayed true to maternal feminism and pacifism during the war were also socialist or communist, such as the Canadian Gertrude Richardson."]}, {"page": "Roaring River (Manitoba)", "response": ["In 1911 Gertrude Twilley (later Gertrude Richardson by marriage) and her mother moved from England to Canada to stay with Gertrude's brother Fred on his homestead in the Roaring River district of Manitoba. The Roaring River Suffrage Association was founded in March 1912, with both men and women as members. "]}]}}
