Fox's daughter Jessica Fox won gold in the girls' K1 slalom event at the 2010 Youth Olympic Games. In the K1 Slalom event at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, Jessica, at the age of 18, gained revenge against the 44-yr-old Czech paddler \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nka Hilgertov\u00e1 who had beaten her mother Myriam to the K1 gold medal in the Atlanta Summer Olympics in 1996, sixteen years earlier when Jessica was only 2-years-old. Jessica came second in the final of the K1, improving on her mother's bronze from Atlanta 1996 and her father's 4th in Barcelona 1992 to earn the immediate nickname from her teammates and the press of \"the Silver Fox\". Her father, Richard, was at the end of the course to congratulate her. Jessica's mother Miriam stated in an interview with her daughter after the race, \"she's better than I was... there's not another 18-yr-old in the world that's of her standard\". Richard was already at the end of his competitive career in 1992 when whitewater slalom canoeing first became a regular Olympic event (it had been a one-off demonstration event at the 1972 Munich Olympics), so it's difficult to assess what his medal tally might have been in Moscow (1980), Los Angeles (1984), and Seoul (1988), but he was 21 when he won his first individual World Championship title, compared to Jessica's Olympic success at 18. Richard and Miriam believe Jessica (the silver) Fox could go on to eclipse both of them."]}, {"page": "Myriam Fox-Jerusalmi", "response": ["Her husband, Richard, competed for Great Britain in slalom canoeing, and later coached Australia in the same event.
