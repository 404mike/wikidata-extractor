He finally made his return to action, and his first appearance of the season, on 3 February 2010 in the 2\u20133 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion, following an injury to regular right-back Neal Eardley and central defender Alex Baptiste falling ill prior to the game, meaning Coid was a late call-up to the squad and then the starting line-up. He played despite only a handful of training sessions since recovering from his injuries. However, he was forced out of the action at half-time after feeling his hamstring strain.

Holloway explained: \"I'm disappointed \u2013 we'll have a party once we've got 52 points. If they think that's appropriate, then they're messing with the wrong man.

When Birmingham right-back Neal Eardley injured a knee just before the end of the summer transfer window, the club made a further bid for Caddis, who had remained out of favour at Swindon. The bid, reportedly in the region of \u00a3150,000 was accepted, and Caddis signed a three-year contract with Birmingham on 2 September. He became a regular in the side, and scored his first goals for Birmingham on 30 November in the first half of the league match at Barnsley, with a  drive and a penalty. On the last day of the season, Birmingham needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Nikola \u017digi\u0107 scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Caddis, who produced what he thought was his first ever headed goal to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status."]}]}}
