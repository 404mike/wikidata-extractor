He admitted to imitating the work of Robert Byron when he first began making notes of his travels. While in Patagonia he read In Our Time by Ernest Hemingway, whom he admired for his spare prose. While writing In Patagonia, Chatwin strove to approach his writing as a \"literary Cartier-Bresson.\" Chatwin's biographer described the resulting prose as \"quick snapshots of ordinary people\". Along with Hemingway and Cartier-Bresson, Osip Mandelstam's work strongly influenced Chatwin during the writing of In Patagonia. An admirer of No\u00ebl Coward, Chatwin found the breakfast scene in Private Lives helpful in learning to write dialogue.
