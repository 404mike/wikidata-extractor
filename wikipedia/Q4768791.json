Albert Speer later said that Hitler was certain that \"through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different.\" The Duke, suggests the biographer Anne Sebba, probably wanted to restore the countries' close ties that had been broken by the First World War. He also wanted to make his new wife the centrepiece of a state visit. The historian Ted Powell suggests that the Duke would have visited any country that would accept his wife on his terms; Windsor's equerry Dudley Forwood points out that the only state visit possible was to Germany, and also suggested that the Duke wished to prove to his wife that he had lost nothing by abdicating."]}, {"page": "Mark Sebba", "response": ["Sebba was a trustee of the Victoria and Albert Museum.
