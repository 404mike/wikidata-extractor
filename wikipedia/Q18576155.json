Gavin moved on to another headship in 1897. The junior department transferred to Kennedy Road in 1959. In 2008 a new prep school was formed by the merger of the existing junior department with Kingsland Grange, a boys\u2019 prep school.

When the Girls' Day School Trust, then the Girls' Public Day School Trust, was formed in 1872, it established its first two schools in West London. In January 1873, the Trust opened Chelsea High School (a predecessor of Kensington Preparatory School) to serve the area immediately to the west of the centre of the city and nine months later, Notting Hill High School which was to serve families in the area to the north of Hyde Park. Harriet Morant Jones was the founding head who looked after ten pupils assisted by her sister. Harriet Jones retired in 1900 and controversially Ethel Gavin was appointed instead of an internal heir apparent and resignations followed.
