The Port Vale starting line-up were largely the same eleven that defeated Preston, but with Gary West starting in place of Alan Webb. Bristol Rovers were reported to have reserve players Paul Nixon and Willmott on stand-by as Devon White, Phil Purnell and leading scorer Gary Penrice faced late fitness tests, though all three would start the game. Francis was though unable to name Geoff Twentyman, who was suspended, whilst loanees  Bailey and Ian Hazel both returned to their parent clubs. Francis stated that \"we are going to give it a real go. We are not letting up now\"."]}]}}
