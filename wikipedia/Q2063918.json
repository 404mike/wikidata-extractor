Holliday described a mechanism of DNA-strand exchange that attempted to explain gene-conversion events that occur during meiosis in fungi. That model first proposed in 1964 and is now known as the Holliday Junction.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epigenetics", "response": ["Robin Holliday defined in 1990 epigenetics as \"the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms.\" Thus, in its broadest sense, epigenetic can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism."]}, {"page": "1964 in science", "response": ["* British molecular biologist Robin Holliday proposes existence of the Holliday junction in nucleic acid."]}, {"page": "Homologous recombination", "response": ["In 1947, the microbiologist Joshua Lederberg showed that bacteria\u2014which had been assumed to reproduce only asexually through binary fission\u2014are capable of genetic recombination, which is  more similar to sexual reproduction.  This work established E. coli as a model organism in genetics, and helped Lederberg win the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Building on studies in fungi, in  1964 Robin Holliday proposed a model for recombination in meiosis which introduced key details of how the process can work, including the exchange of material between chromosomes through Holliday junctions.  In 1983, Jack Szostak and colleagues presented a model now known as the DSBR pathway, which accounted for observations not explained by the Holliday model.  During the next decade, experiments in Drosophila, budding yeast and mammalian cells led to the emergence of other models of homologous recombination, called SDSA pathways, which do not always rely on Holliday junctions."]}, {"page": "Holliday junction", "response": ["A Holliday junction is a branched nucleic acid structure that contains four double-stranded arms joined. These arms may adopt one of several conformations depending on buffer salt concentrations and the sequence of nucleobases closest to the junction. The structure is named after Robin Holliday, the molecular biologist who proposed its existence in 1964.", "Robin Holliday proposed the junction structure that now bears his name as part of his model of homologous recombination in 1964, based on his research on the organisms Ustilago maydis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The model provided a molecular mechanism that explained both gene conversion and chromosomal crossover. Holliday realized that the proposed pathway would create  heteroduplex DNA segments with base mismatches between different versions of a single gene. He predicted that the cell would have a mechanism for mismatch repair, which was later discovered. Prior to Holliday's model, the accepted model involved a copy-choice mechanism where the new strand is synthesized directly from parts of the different parent strands.", "Initially, geneticists assumed that the junction would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, because that would place the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially the structure of the junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it."]}, {"page": "Hitchin Boys' School", "response": ["* Dr Robin Holliday, molecular biologist"]}, {"page": "Suresh Rattan", "response": ["Suresh Rattan has been heading, since its inception in 1984, the Laboratory of Cellular Ageing at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the Aarhus University in Denmark, where he has become Emeritus since 2020.
