Biographer Stephen Rebello claimed Universal imposed two films on him, Torn Curtain (1966) and Topaz (1969), the latter of which is based on a Leon Uris novel, partly set in Cuba. Both were spy thrillers with Cold War-related themes. Torn Curtain, with Paul Newman and Julie Andrews, precipitated the bitter end of the 12-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrmann.;  Hitchcock was unhappy with Herrmann's score and replaced him with John Addison, Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. Upon release, Torn Curtain was a box office failure, and Topaz was disliked by critics and the studio."]}, {"page": "December 7", "response": ["*1998 \u2013 John Addison, English-American composer and conductor (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "March 16", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 John Addison, English-American soldier and composer (d. 1998)"]}, {"page": "Tony Richardson", "response": ["Among stars that Richardson directed were Jeanne Moreau, Orson Welles, Rob Lowe, Milton Berle, Trevor Howard, David Hemmings, Nicol Williamson, Tom Courtenay, Lynn Redgrave, Marianne Faithfull, Richard Burton,Until dismissed by Richardson for repeatedly failing to show up on set as contracted (Richardson, pp. 212\u20133) Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Mick Jagger, Katharine Hepburn, Seth Green, Tommy Lee Jones and Judi Dench.

The basic issue was Osborne's unwillingness to go through the rewrite process, more arduous in film than it is in the theatre. Richardson had a different version. In his autobiography (p.\u00a0195), he writes that Osborne was angry at being replaced in a small role by Laurence Harvey to whom the producers had obligations.
