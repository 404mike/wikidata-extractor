Although a caterer by profession she frequently takes long cycle trips (such as circumnavigating Britain or Japan \u2013 or crossing the Sahara on her bicycle whilst suffering kidney problems) and then writes a humorous travelogue detailing her experiences. She lives near Portsmouth, England. She has two daughters and a son.\n}}\nShe began to use cooking to pay for her cycling trips at the age of 15 and by 17 it had paid for her first significant trip, around the coast of Britain, inspired by a tour of the Isle of Wight when she was 10. By September 2005, she had cycled through 48 countries and by 2010 she had covered more than 350,000 miles.She crossed Europe with her boyfriend, which led to her first writing success, Wind in my Wheels. After her boyfriend was injured in a crash she began travelling alone, which she prefers, despite those who find it strange.In March 2007, Long Cloud Ride, her book about New Zealand, was selected among the top 10 writer's reads by Geographical.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bicycle touring", "response": ["* Josie Dew"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British cyclists", "response": ["What do I do about Josie Dew who is a British cyclist, but isn't a sportsperson.
