This is considered a result of the Spirit working in the person and is not a result of personal deeds. Also in the words of St. Paul, \"...he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.\" (Epistle to the Philippians 1:6). The \"deeds of the flesh\" here include not only external behavior, but also those habits, attitudes, compulsions, addictions, etc. (sometimes called egoic passions) which oppose themselves to true being and living as a Christian not only exteriorly, but interiorly as well. Evelyn Underhill describes purification as an awareness of one's own imperfections and finiteness, followed by self-discipline and mortification. Because of its physical, disciplinary aspect, this phase, as well as the entire Christian spiritual path, is often referred to as \"ascetic,\" a term which is derived from a Greek word which connotes athletic training. Because of this, in ancient Christian literature, prominent mystics are often called \"spiritual athletes,\" an image which is also used several times in the New Testament to describe the Christian life.  What is sought here is salvation in the original sense of the word, referring not only to one's eternal fate, but also to healing in all areas of life, including the restoration of spiritual, psychological, and physical health.", "Author and mystic Evelyn Underhill recognizes two additional phases to the mystical path. First comes the awakening, the stage in which one begins to have some consciousness of absolute or divine reality. Purgation and illumination are followed by a fourth stage which Underhill, borrowing the language of St. John of the Cross, calls the dark night of the soul. This stage, experienced by the few, is one of final and complete purification and is marked by confusion, helplessness, stagnation of the will, and a sense of the withdrawal of God's presence. This dark night of the soul is not, in Underhill's conception, the Divine Darkness of the pseudo-Dionysius and German Christian mysticism. It is the period of final \"unselfing\" and the surrender to the hidden purposes of the divine will. Her fifth and final stage is union with the object of love, the one Reality, God. Here the self has been permanently established on a transcendental level and liberated for a new purpose.", "* Evelyn Underhill: The Spiritual Life: Four Broadcast Talks, Hodder & Stoughton, 1937, x, 141 p."]}, {"page": "The Cloud of Unknowing", "response": ["This work became known to English Catholics in the mid-17th century, when the Benedictine monk, Augustine Baker (1575\u20131641), wrote an exposition on its doctrine based on a manuscript copy in the library of the monastery of Cambrai in Flanders.
