Although it was named \"single of the week\" by Sounds, it stalled at number 40 in the British charts, which EMI and Rowland believed was due to Rhodes' poor production. Rowland said, \"We learned that early on, that the wrong producer can totally screw your record up.\" As a result, Dexys fired Rhodes and signed with EMI, and EMI immediately put Pete Wingfield in charge of their production. Saunders and Ward left the band, replaced by Andy Leek (keyboards) and Andy \"Stoker\" Growcott (drums).", "Dexys' debut LP, Searching for the Young Soul Rebels, which featured \"Geno\", was released in July 1980. The label of the album also included the band's \"Late Night Feelings\" imprint, and the album's sleeve featured a photograph of a Belfast Catholic boy carrying his belongings after moving from his home during the Troubles; the Irish-descended Rowland explained that \"I wanted a picture of unrest. It could have been from anywhere but I was secretly glad that it was from Ireland.\" Of the album's title, Rowland said \"I don't know\u00a0... I just liked the sound of it, really.\"  Of the songs on the album, only two (\"Geno\" and \"There, There, My Dear\") were written by Rowland (lyrics) and Archer (music) together; producer Pete Wingfield hadn't liked Rowland's lyrics on their third co-composition (\"Keep It\") and had instead turned those lyrics into a separate song (\"Love Part One\"); Blythe wrote new lyrics for the version of \"Keep It\" on the album.Kevin Archer, Liner notes to Searching for the Young Soul Rebels (2000)  The same month, Rowland imposed a press embargo on the band; instead, Dexys would take out ads in the music papers explaining the band's position on various issues.
