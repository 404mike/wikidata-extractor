Starting as a follower of Edwin Lutyens, in the 1920s he gained a reputation as a designer of country houses. He turned towards architectural modernism in the 1930s, though in doing so he did not abandon his appreciation of natural materials. His plans made abundant use of curving lines. He also became known for luxurious interior decoration. Hill was the architect of the Midland Hotel in Morecambe, Lancashire and of the British pavilion at the Paris Exposition of 1937.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of landscape architects", "response": ["* Oliver Hill"]}, {"page": "Eric Gill", "response": ["The Art Deco Midland Hotel was built in 1932\u201333 by the London Midland & Scottish Railway to the design of Oliver Hill and included works by Gill, Marion Dorn, and Eric Ravilious."]}, {"page": "Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne", "response": ["Britain had not been expecting such a competitive exposition, and its planned budget was only a small fraction of Germany's.

Its contents were crafts objects arranged according to English words which had become loanwords in French, such as \"sport\" and \"weekend\", and included some items by renowned potter William Worrall.
