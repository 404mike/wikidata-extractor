This included a debate between Edward Spencer and Moses Wall, an MP and a scholar respectively, on ben Israel's millennial claims and the manner in which the Jews would be converted. Wall and Spencer's letters were printed in later additions of the book.

It has been pointed out that he held many of the same hopes regarding the readmission and conversion of the Jews as the millenarians. Paul Rycaut, later ambassador to the port of Smyrna recalled the Whitehall Conference, \"When they all met, he (Cromwell) ordered the Jews to speak for themselves. After that he turned to the clergy, who inveigled much against the Jews as a cruel and cursed people. Cromwell in his answer to the Clergy called them \u2018Men of God\u2019 and desired to be informed by the whether it was not their opinion that the Jews were one day to be called into the Church? He then desired to know whether it was not every Christian man\u2019s duty to forward that good end all he could?\u2026 was it not then our duty\u2026 to encourage them to settle ere where they could be taught the thuth\u2026[sic]\"Scult, Mel (1978). P.30 It has also been pointed out that Cromwell held more practical beliefs. Cromwell believed that Jews could be used as skilled purveyors of foreign intelligence (which would assist his territorial ambitions).Fraser, Antonia. (1973). Cromwell, Our Chief of Men. Hachette. 2011.  This view first appeared in Lucien Wolf\u2019s essay Cromwell's Jewish Intelligencers: A Paper Read at Jews' College Literary Society, May 10th, 1891. Further, toleration of Protestant sects made political sense for Cromwell as it prevented disorder and promoted harmony. He justified the readmission of the Jews using this same tolerant approach, as well as believing that it would improve trade (he saw the Jews as an important part of Amsterdam\u2019s financial success).Sharp, David (2003).

He wrote \u2018What is Judaism? A Question of To-day\u2019 in The Fortnightly Review (1884) in response to the biological-racist anti-Semitism of Goldwin Smith, and accepted Smith\u2019s premises (that the Jews were a biological race shaped by a religion that was, in its essence, merely legalism), with a strategy had been to attempt to reverse the value judgment. Wolf understood evolution in the strongly progressive sense that was common to much Victorian thought, with the environment selecting for traits that would maximize racial hygiene and permanently and continually improve the character of the Jewish race over time. Wolf asserted that \u2018the optimism of Judaism\u2019 as \u2018expressed in \u201clegalism\u201d\u2019 gave Jews a 30% or 40% advantage over those of other religions and creeds, and not only explained their survival over the ages but actually represented an important moment in the story of human evolution. The \u2018wisdom and power\u2019 of Judaism had enabled it to \u2018accomplish of itself a distinct step in the history of the human species.\u2019", "Both Wolf and Jacobs presented Judaism as a case study for the investigation of the role of religion in human evolution, thereby humanizing and universalizing the Jew at the same time. Both men believed that by viewing Jewish religion through the prism of evolutionary theory they could construe Jewish difference in such a way as to counter the threat to assimilation posed by racial antisemitism.Langton Daniel R.

The book subsequently appeared in many forms, one of the most popular being in Yiddish, with quaint illustrations. Though the chronicle is more legendary than historical, it is not unlikely that ancient sources were used by the first compiler. The book enjoyed great popularity in England. In 1558, Peter Morvyn translated an abbreviated version into English, and edition after edition was called for. Lucien Wolf has shown that the English translations of the Bible aroused so much interest in the Jews that there was a widespread desire to know more about them. This led to the circulation of many editions of Josippon, which thus formed a link in the chain of events which culminated in the readmission of the Jews to England by Oliver Cromwell. As the Muslim writer ibn Hazm (d. 1063) was acquainted with the Arabic translation by a Yemenite Jew, Daniel Chwolson proposes that the author lived at the beginning of the 9th century."]}, {"page": "Maccabaeans", "response": ["* Lucien Wolf"]}, {"page": "Jewish Historical Society of England", "response": ["The Jewish Historical Society of England (JHSE) was founded in 1893 by several Anglo-Jewish scholars, including Lucien Wolf, who became the society's first president.

The establishment was a response to Herzl's rejection of Uganda proposal, as the ITO led by Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement. It attempted to locate territory suitable for Jewish settlement in various parts of America (e.g. Galveston), and on the African, Asian, and Australian continents, yet with little success.", "In 1905 the members of the Seventh Zionist Congress formally rejected the Uganda Scheme. Following the rejection of the East Africa offer, Zangwill contacted Lucien Wolf, an English Jewish journalist and member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main representative body of Anglo Jewry. Wolf was an opponent of political Zionism, but did support the creation of Jewish colonies in the Diaspora. In August 1905 Zangwill and Wolf met to discuss the Uganda Scheme, and in subsequent correspondence between the two we learn that both supported the creation of a Jewish colony in British East Africa. Wolf had objected to any specifically \"Jewish national homeland\", that is to say a state which ghettoized Jews, preserving Jewish customs and law as the basis for governance. Though Zangwill's literary works suggest his nostalgia for the ghetto, he too recognized the need for a modern Jewish polity. Both concurred that a self-governing Jewish territory should be based on a preponderance of Jews in the region rather than British legislative fiat, and both concurred that the new government should be formed on a modern, democratic basis rather than some earlier biblical ideal or Eastern European Kehilla structure. This basic agreement between Zangwill and Wolf would lead to the formation of the Jewish Territorial Organisation (ITO), an organisation dedicated to \"obtaining a large tract of territory (preferably within the British Empire) wherein to found a Jewish Home of Refuge\", and to the elevation of Zangwill to the ITO presidency."]}, {"page": "David Icke", "response": ["The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an anti-Semitic literary forgery, probably written under the direction of the Russian secret police in Paris, purporting to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination.

Once exposed, it disappeared from mainstream discourse until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s.

After the Balfour Declaration of 1917, Greenberg still kept on sniping at Weizmann, writing, for example, that Weizmann should have demanded \"a Jewish state\" rather than a mere \"national home\" and complaining that Palestine meant \"both sides of the Jordan river\". That row only ended when Greenberg died in 1931. Greenberg did not live to see the declaration of independent Israel. Greenberg had long subscribed to the intellectual Zionist Theory that Jews were naturally homeless people, perpetually in search of salvation. This came in the form of Britain's promise of assistance, but anti-Zionist moderates suffered from the different parameters to the revolutionaries. Lucien Wolf and the Conjoint Committee had tried to limit damage to their cause, but a statement in The Times of 24 May 1917 revealed the extent of the split in Jewry about Zionist ambitions.
