He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks and captained Wales against Ireland in 1908. He played club rugby for Cardiff.\nWinfield is not one of the most well known of the players from the first Welsh Golden Era, which was probably due to his solid but unspectacular style of play. He was a strong kicker of the ball and in the fifteen matches he played for his country he scored 14 conversions and 6 penalty goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Winfield", "response": ["* Bert Winfield, (1878-1919) Welsh international rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Cardiff RFC", "response": ["In 1905, there were four Cardiff players in the Wales team that famously beat New Zealand: Harding, Nicholls, Bush, Gabe and Bert Winfield, who would go on to captain Wales three years later.

However New Zealand were generally perceived to be the better side in the second half, with the performance of the Welsh fullback Bert Winfield keeping his team in the game. The most controversial moment of the tour happened late in the second half. Wallace recovered a Welsh kick and cut across the field, and with only Winfield to beat, passed to the New Zealand wing Deans. What happened next has provoked intense debate: Deans was tackled by the Welsh and either fell short of the try-line, or placed the ball over it before being dragged back. Dallas, who had dressed in heavy clothing and was struggling to keep up with the pace of the game, was  behind play. When he arrived he ruled that Deans was short of the try-line, and so did not award New Zealand a try. Play continued, but the All Blacks could not score, and Wales won 3\u20130. This was New Zealand's first loss of the tour."]}, {"page": "Jack Bancroft", "response": ["As well as playing for Swansea at club level, Bancroft was capped eighteen times for the Welsh national team.

It was while with Penarth that Dyke played his most notable games, and his first experience of international rugby came in 1905, when he was selected to play for Glamorgan against the Original All Blacks. The Glamorgan match was played just five days after New Zealand's historic clash with Wales, and the majority of the Welsh team were expected to turn out for the Glamorgan game. With the match approaching the majority of the team dropped out, including Wales fullback Bert Winfield.Billot (1972), pg 34.

In late 1905, Brown was part of the Cardiff team to face the Original All Blacks, his first encounter with international opposition. In a very close match, Cardiff lost 10-8. The next season saw the South Africa tour Britain, and Brown faced them twice, at county and then club level. He first faced South Africa when he was selected to represent Welsh county team Glamorgan. Brown was a surprise choice and joined the team along with Cardiff team mates George Northmore, Bert Winfield, Rhys Gabe and Billy O'Neill. In a very quick paced game, the South Africans won 6-3, and then went on to beat Wales in a shock win a month later. On 1 January 1907 the South Africans met Cardiff in the last game of the tour, having only lost one match, against Scotland, in a 28-game campaign. The game was one of the highlights of the tour, with many of the Cardiff players having been humiliated by the South Africans in the Wales defeat, playing for pride. In the forwards, Brown, Casey and O'Neill worked tirelessly for Cardiff, against a South African team lacking unison;Davies (1975), pg 65. and it was from Brown's performance on this game that he would later win his Welsh cap.Davies (1975), pg 61.
