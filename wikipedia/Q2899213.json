He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks and captained Wales against Ireland in 1908. He played club rugby for Cardiff.\nWinfield is not one of the most well known of the players from the first Welsh Golden Era, which was probably due to his solid but unspectacular style of play. He was a strong kicker of the ball and in the fifteen matches he played for his country he scored 14 conversions and 6 penalty goals.", "link_mentions": {}}}
