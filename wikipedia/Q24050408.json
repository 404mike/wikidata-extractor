(My understanding is that a 301 redirect is used to indicate that a resource has permanently moved to a new URL.) From what I remember, I noticed this behavior with the example URL in the Wikidata entry for the Auckland Art Gallery artist ID. To test the behavior, from what I remember, I probably did an external links search for the URL pattern http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/explore-art-and-ideas/artist/. From these search results, I used AAG links from the pages for \u00c9douard Manet, Andy Warhol, Olivia Spencer Bower, and Gordon Crook as additional testcases. (The online tool at https://httpstatus.io is useful for determining if a URL generates any redirects.) I also adjusted the sandbox for Module:Authority control to contain the same contents as the actual module. Subsequently, I adjusted the module sandbox to use HTTPS for the AAG link. For the artist pages mentioned previously, what I would do was to edit the page and adjust the page to use the Authority control sandbox instead of the actual Authority control template, and then I would preview the page with the changes, but without actually saving the changes. By doing this, I was able to get an idea of what would happen if the page used Authority control logic that generated an HTTPS AAG URL."]}]}}
