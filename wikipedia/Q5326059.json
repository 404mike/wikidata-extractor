He then moved back into radio when Radio London started in 1964 to present the 9:00 A.M - 12:00 P.M slot, he was also the administrator on board the MV Galaxy radio ship that the station broadcast from. Earl stayed with the pirate station until the spring of 1966.\nEarl then became a familiar voice on Yorkshire Television in the late 1960s and 1970s as a continuity announcer [1].\nIncidentally, Yorkshire Television also hired Richmond's fellow Radio London DJs John Crosse and Paul Kaye as announcers, as well as Keith Martin from Radio Caroline and Terry Davis from Radio North Sea.\nAfter leaving Yorkshire Television, he moved to Thailand to set up a production company and work on English-language radio in Bangkok.

Among his first trainees was James Whale. Spence developed a strong commitment to training and development during his years at UBN and Radio Trent, and that, together with his ability to talent spot, led Michael Bukht, then programme controller at Capital Radio, to ask him in 1980 to join the newly established National Broadcasting School as head of programming.", "He was not the only DJ broadcasting to the UK to develop the American top-40 format for a British audience, but he was the first to master it, and he took it further and faster than his contemporaries, making early pirate radio colleagues like Earl Richmond and Tony Windsor look stuffy in their turn. In doing so, he helped prove to the British government that British audiences had a thirst for something other than the staid BBC approach. In the event, in 1967 the British government introduced the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, and the BBC established its national pop music station Radio 1. Once commercial radio had been ruled out by the British government, interest in Spence in the US was nil.Billboard, 2 October 1971, p.28"]}, {"page": "List of continuity announcers in the United Kingdom", "response": ["| Helen Aitken (1995\u20132002), Tracey Crawford, John Crosse (early 1970s\u20131999), Neil Didsbury (2001\u20132002), Brian Durkin, Kerrie Gosney (2000\u20132002), Pete Haslam, John Jason, Paul Kaye (c. 1970s\u20131980), Redvers Kyle (1968\u20131993),Paul Lally (c. 1968-1990s), Peter Lewis (late 1960s), Keith Martin, Maggie Mash (1988\u20132002), Nick Oliver, Karen Petch, Bob Preedy (1988\u20132002), Earl Richmond (1968-c. 1970s), Graham Roberts (c. 1968-1993), Andy Siddle,Ian de Stains (1968\u20131970), Roger Tilling (1998\u20131999), Colin Weston, Stephen Whitlock (1992\u20131994)"]}]}}
