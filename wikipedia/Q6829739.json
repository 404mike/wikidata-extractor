Davie was the editor of the diaries of novelist Evelyn Waugh; the volume appeared in 1976. That year he won the What the Papers Say 'Journalist of the Year' Award.In 1977, he settled in Melbourne, Australia, where he became Associate Editor of The Age, becoming the newspaper's editor in 1979, a post he retained until returning to London and The Observer in 1981 for the remainder of his career.
