Office\" on the ship Zealand, a depot ship moored on the Thames, through the interest of Sir George Cayley Bart of Brompton, North Yorkshire which if true suggests that his family had some standing in the area. In 1801, Cooper joined the Medusa, a 38-gun frigate, as secretary (or clerk) to Captain John Gore. During the following five years, Medusa ventured on a number of voyages and saw action, taking a number of Spanish prizes. In February 1806, Cooper was transferred with his captain (knighted and rich from prize money) to Revenge, a ship of the line. For the next two-and-a-half years, Cooper spent much of his time on Revenge which was blockading enemy ports and, when Gore temporarily retired in August 1808 due to ill health, Cooper was given two good-conduct certificates by Gore (found in his possession when arrested). This led to a promotion as purser, first in the sloop Pelorus and later in the frigate Orpheus. In early 1811, when Cooper returned home, he was appointed as purser to the receiving ship Princess moored in the Mersey.", "Cracks soon began to appear in Cooper's 'good conduct'. In July 1813, John Wilson Croker, Secretary to the Admiralty, instigated an enquiry which reported that \"from the victualling book of Lancelot Cooper... 70 men appeared discharged... to the Intelligent Gun Brig in July 1812 although their victualling is claimed by Mr Cooper\". As a result, Cooper was dismissed from the Royal Navy for misconduct. In his petition Cooper makes no mention of his disgrace stating \"he remained in her (the Princess) until the fall of 1813\". He then asserts that he embarked on a Royal Navy ship from Plymouth carrying dispatches to Admiral Sir John Gore, who was blockading Venice, then under French rule. When he reached Gore, as Napoleon had just abdicated, he was asked by Gore to go ashore and liaise with the Austrian authorities as His Britannic Majesty's Consul. This version was later contradicted by Gore in a letter to William Powell in 1825 in which Gore stated that Cooper had arrived on his ship, asked to be reinstated as secretary which was refused, and was put ashore without further delay. Notwithstanding this true version of events, Cooper did indeed manage to convince the Austrians that he was the newly appointed Consul and evidence for this is provided by a letter written by John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare (1792-1851) to an unknown recipient from Whitehall on 25 April (1827):", "The petition submitted in a plea for mercy is the main source of information about the first half of Cooper's life. Collaboration for his account of the beginning of his naval career include the good-conduct certificates written by Sir John Gore and letters of recommendation accompanying the petition from captains of other ships in which he served. The latter part of his petition is probably false with the exception of his self-appointment as Consul in Venice. One further clue about the truth is found in The Times of 1827. In it the reporter states that \"amongst his papers was found a letter written in French and addressed to the Princess Charlotte of Wales in the handwriting of the late...Queen Caroline. It contains a...request that the princess would use her interest to induce Lord Castlereagh to restore the bearer in the situation of consul of Venice\". This letter suggests that Cooper was forced to relinquish the post of Consul but does not give any information as to how long he had this position. There are also other mysteries remaining about his life, particularly his early years, the gap between approximately 1817 and 1825 and the year of his death. Finally there is the question of his physical features and perceived character. His appearance was unremarkable as during his trial he was described as being \"about 5ft 9in in height, stout made, bald at top and before and a strong north country dialect\". However, his manner must have convinced as William Powell wrote that \"the world could not produce a more religious, charitable and humane man, nor one on whom I could with more safety bestow the hand of my child\""]}, {"page": "Battle of the Levant Convoy", "response": ["Martin was unaware that the convoy had sailed earlier than anticipated, reaching Gibraltar ahead of Richery and long before Ganteaume even sailed.

He joined the fleet in early 1814 and subsequently took command of Revenge on the Cadiz blockade and in the Adriatic Sea.Marshall, Royal Naval Biography, p. 483 As such he took part in the blockade of Venice from 22 March which ended when Italy was surrendered by France, at which point the squadron Hart was a part of sailed for Corfu to oversee the handover of that island from the French to Britain on 8 June.
