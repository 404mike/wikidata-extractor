None of the locomotives were ready on Wednesday. The following day at 10:30\u00a0am Rocket started its  journey forwards and backwards across the 1\u00bd-mile (2.4-kilometre) course. It covered the first thirty-five miles in 3 hours and 12 minutes, the coke and water were replenished for fifteen minutes, and completed the course in another 2 hours 57 minutes. It had run at an average speed of , and the highest speed reached was over . Novelty still had to run, and was the favourite, although George is recorded as saying \"Eh mon, we needn't fear yon thing, her's got nae goots\"; she tried to run that Saturday but a steam pressurised joint rapidly failed. Sans Pareil was found to be overweight the following Tuesday, but allowed to run. She burnt fuel at more than three times the rate of Rocket before her boiler ran dry.
