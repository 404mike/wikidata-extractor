He is Stoke's record appearance holder having played in 597 matches in all competitions.Skeels joined Stoke City in 1959 and soon established himself and an indispensable member of Tony Waddington's starting eleven. He was able to play in all outfield positions and became known for his consistency and racked up a club record 597 appearances. During his 17-year spell at the Victoria Ground he helped Stoke to win the Second Division in 1962\u201363, finish as runner-up of the League Cup in 1964, before winning the competition in 1972 he also helped them to reach the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1970\u201371 and 1971\u201372. He left for American side Seattle Sounders in 1976 before spending a short spell back in Stoke-on-Trent with Port Vale.

He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at \"half pace\". His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976\u201377. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978\u201379 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were \"boring\", as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him."]}, {"page": "Dennis Viollet", "response": ["He joined a team being re-built by Tony Waddington, containing experienced players such as Stanley Matthews, and Jackie Mudie and also emerging talent such as John Ritchie and Eric Skeels.

He made a decent start to his Stoke career scoring five goals towards the end of the 1961\u201362 season meaning that hopes were high for 1962\u201363. While six games without a win heralded another poor start for Stoke, Viollet kick-started Stoke's season with four goals against Charlton Athletic on 12 September. That win gave Stoke the impetus to embark on an unbeaten run of 18, ended by Leeds United on 15 December.
