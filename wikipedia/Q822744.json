B. Maxwell's The Devil's Garden, for failing their criteria. The authors directed a publicity campaign opposing the boycott. The Woman Thou Gavest Me, the second of Caine's novels to address the Woman Question, \"arraigns the divorce laws\" of the time. Father Bernard Vaughan, known for his sermons on The Sins of Society, denounced Caine's book saying \"it showed startling ignorance of Roman Catholic doctrine and practice\". The novel was one of several books the Catholic Federation in Auckland, New Zealand wanted removed from sale. In Wyndham, Western Australia the committee of Little River Mechanics Institute Free Library ordered the book banned and burnt. American newspapers reported of a Methodist preacher's daughter that eloped and married the son of a prominent family, who later divorced her and took away her child. She was arrested on the street for Immorality. After three days in jail Eugene V. Debs, five times Socialist candidate for President of the United States sheltered her in his home. It was Debs' \"challenge to the Christianity of Terre Haute\", Indiana. Parallels were drawn between the problem that Debs handled in real life and Caine's fictional story of Mary O'Neill, who marries unhappily and ends up on the street without shelter, with the whole world turned against her. The Woman Thou Gavest Me was reprinted five times before the end of 1913 when nearly half a million copies had been sold. The Times Literary Supplement listed it as the most popular novel of that year. New York's Bookman, listed it as the fifth best-seller of October 1913."]}, {"page": "Herbert Vaughan", "response": ["* Bernard Vaughan, his brother"]}, {"page": "Vaughan (surname)", "response": ["*Bernard Vaughan (1847\u20131922), English Roman Catholic clergyman", "*Bernard Vaughan (actor) (early 20th century), British silent film actor"]}, {"page": "List of Old Stonyhursts", "response": ["*Fr Bernard Vaughan, Jesuit social reformer who worked among the poor of Westminster and in the East End.
