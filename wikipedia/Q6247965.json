The RHC was formed in June 1970 among loyalists in the Shankill area of west Belfast, by John McKeague (who was also involved with Tara), William \"Plum\" Smith and colleagues from the Shankill Defence Association. Membership was high in the Shankill, east Belfast, Sandy Row and Newtownabbey areas as well as in parts of County Down. A cell was also allegedly based in County Tyrone, near Castlederg.Sunday World, 14 November 1993. The RHC agreed in 1972 to become an integral part of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). It kept its own structures but in operational matters agreed to share weapons and personnel and often carried out attacks in the name of the UVF.Garland, p. 151 It was proscribed by William Whitelaw, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on 12 November 1973. According to Jim Wilson, chairman of the Reach Programme with association of the Red Hand Commando, the RHC numbered well over one thousand members during its campaign, and as of 2017 membership numbers were in the small hundreds who are engaged in community work.", "*29 January 1982: RHC founder John McKeague was shot dead at his shop on Albertbridge Road, Belfast. by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).Jack Holland & Henry McDonald, INLA \u2013 Deadly Divisions, Torc, 1994, pp. 199\u2013200"]}, {"page": "Red Hand Defenders", "response": ["McDonald (2001) characterizes the LVF and UDA ceasefire agreements as \"official fiction\". 2001-09-29  The LVF denies these claims, stating that its armed campaign has ended. 1999-03-16  LVF members were aware that any breach of the ceasefire could result in the return to jail for those paramilitary prisoners freed as part of the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998.  This essentially served as an incentive for the groups to create a cover name.  As a result, the actual existence of the RHD has consistently been called into question. Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald have argued that the RHD and the Orange Volunteers are both overseen by a Christian fundamentalist preacher they identify only as the Pastor. The Pastor, a former associate of William McGrath, John McKeague and George Seawright and a long-established British intelligence agent, is said by the authors to provide his own form of fundamentalist, anti-Catholic Protestantism to the two groups' fluid membership of young men, most of whom are also UDA or LVF members.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF: Endgame, Poolbeg, 2008, pp. 376-382"]}, {"page": "Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh", "response": ["In late December 1976, along with Joe Cahill, he met two representatives of the Ulster Loyalist Central Coordinating Committee, John McKeague and John McClure, at the request of the latter body. Their purpose was to try to find a way to accommodate the ULCCC proposals for an independent Northern Ireland with the Sinn F\u00e9in's \u00c9ire Nua programme. It was agreed that if this could be done, a joint Loyalist-Republican approach could then be made to request the British government to leave Ireland. Desmond Boal QC and Se\u00e1n MacBride SC were requested and accepted to represent the loyalist and republican positions. For months they had meetings in various places including Paris. The dialogue eventually collapsed when Conor Cruise O'Brien, then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and vociferous opponent of the Provisional IRA, became aware of it and condemned it on RT\u00c9 Radio. As the loyalists had insisted on absolute secrecy, they felt unable to continue with the talks as a result.Saoirse , July 2005."]}, {"page": "Shankill Road", "response": ["Similarly, the Ulster Defence Association, established in September 1971, began on the Shankill when vigilante groups such John McKeague's Shankill Defence Association and the Woodvale Defence Association merged into a larger structure. Under the leadership of Charles Harding Smith and Andy Tyrie, the Shankill Road became the centre of UDA activity, with the movement establishing its headquarters on the road. Leading members such as James Craig, Davy Payne and Tommy Lyttle made their homes in the area. The Shankill was covered by the West Belfast Battalion of the UDA, which was divided into three companies: A (Glencairn and Highfield), B (middle Shankill), and C (lower Shankill). During the 1990s, C Company under Johnny Adair became one of the most active units in the UDA, with gunmen such as Stephen McKeag responsible for several murders. C Company would later feud with both the UVF and the rest of the UDA until 2003 when they were forced out. Following the exile of Adair and his supporters, as well as the murder of some such as Alan McCullough, the lower Shankill UDA was once again brought into line with the rest of the movement under former Adair supporter Mo Courtney."]}, {"page": "Michael Stone (loyalist)", "response": ["Following Herron's death, Stone withdrew from the UDA and in January 1974 attached himself to the Red Hand Commando (RHC), a loyalist group that also operated a Braniel unit under Sammy Cinnamond.Stone, None Shall Divide Us, p. 47 According to Stone, one of his earliest duties was acting as a bodyguard to Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party leader Bill Craig. In 1978 the UDA encouraged Stone to join the Royal Irish Rangers at Ballymena, in order that he could receive training with anti-tank weaponry, although he did not receive this training and left after six months.Stone, None Shall Divide Us, pp. 48\u201349. NB: In Stone's autobiography, he described enlisting in the \"Royal Irish Regiment\" even though this group did not come into existence until 1992. He does not specify which of its constituent parts \u2013 the Royal Irish Rangers or the Ulster Defence Regiment \u2013 he joined. According to Martin Dillon, Stone also held membership of Tara, an anti-Catholic and anti-communist organisation led by William McGrath, a close associate of RHC leader John McKeague.Martin Dillon, Stone Cold: The True Story of Michael Stone and the Milltown Massacre, Arrow Books, 1993, p. 30 Dillon also argues that Stone had actually joined the RHC at an earlier date and held simultaneous membership of the other groups, Tara and the UDA. Cross-membership of more than one loyalist group was not unheard of in the early days of the Troubles.Dillon, Stone Cold, pp. 30\u201331"]}, {"page": "Ulster nationalism", "response": ["After the strike loyalism began to embrace Ulster nationalist ideas, with the UDA, in particular, advocating this position.Ian S.

Firm proposals for an independent Ulster were produced in 1976 by the Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee and in 1977 by the UDA's New Ulster Political Research Group. The NUPRG document, Beyond the Religious Divide, has been recently republished with a new introduction. John McMichael, as candidate for the UDA-linked Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party, campaigned for the 1982 South Belfast by-election on the basis of negotiations towards independence. However, McMichael's poor showing of 576 votes saw the plans largely abandoned by the UDA soon after, although the policy was still considered by the Ulster Democratic Party under Ray Smallwoods. A short-lived Ulster Independence Party also operated, although the assassination of its leader, John McKeague, in 1982 saw it largely disappear."]}, {"page": "Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee", "response": ["Seen as an important link between grassroots loyalism and more mainstream unionist politics, the ULCCC was chaired by Glenn Barr and met in the Belfast offices of the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party on a weekly basis. Replacing the earlier Ulster Army Council, it brought together representatives of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), Red Hand Commando, Vanguard Service Corps/Ulster Volunteer Service Corps, Down Orange Welfare (DOW), Loyalist Association of Workers and Orange Volunteers. Barr was soon replaced as chairman by John McKeague and the ULCCC took on the wider aim of preparing for the establishment of a unified \"Ulster army\" in the event of a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, something that had become a leading fear in unionism in the mid-1970s.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA \u2013 Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 11"]}]}}
