He was born at Paulton, Somerset and died at Minehead, also in Somerset.\nWestern was a right-handed middle order batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper who played for the amateur teams that predated the entry of Somerset into first-class cricket in 1882, as well as for the embryonic Somerset county side. He acted as the secretary for the meeting that followed the match between the \"Gentlemen of Somerset\" and the \"Gentlemen of Devon\" at Sidmouth in 1875 that led to the formation of Somerset County Cricket Club and he remained as honorary secretary until first-class status had been achieved.His own cricket career was limited to three matches, in one of which he appeared for MCC against Somerset: this was his most successful game, and he made 13 in MCC's only innings, his highest first-class score.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Edward Western (1882\u20131884) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1884", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Edward Western "]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1882", "response": ["A few days later, Somerset played their first home fixture, at the Taunton Athletic Grounds, hosting Hampshire. In contrast to many of their previous game, the weather was good, and on winning the toss, Hampshire decided to bat first. Charles Seymour batted well for the visitors, accruing 57 out of Hampshire's 146 runs, but Fowler was again the best of the Somerset bowlers, collecting four wickets for nine runs to help restrict the Hampshire total. Ramsay top-scored for Somerset in their reply, accumulating 71 runs before being bowled, while a number of other batsmen made useful scores to help Somerset to their total of 214. Edward Western, the Somerset secretary batted in his only innings of the season for the county, coming in as the last man, but he failed to score a run. Somerset struggled to collect wickets when Hampshire batted again, and tried eight different bowlers without much success. Their fielding was described by the Bristol Mercury as being \"loose\", but when the sixth wicket was taken, with 232 runs scored, the rest followed reasonably quickly, and Hampshire finished on 290. Fowler was dismissed early in Somerset's chase, but Newton and Sainsbury put on 118 runs together to help their towards victory. Sainsbury was dismissed for 63, but Newton continued to bat, putting on 80 runs before being dismissed. Somerset eventually reached the required total with five wickets remaining to achieve their first win of the season."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Edward Western (1882) : E.
