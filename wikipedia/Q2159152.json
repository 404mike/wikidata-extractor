He was created 1st Baronet (Harty of Prospect House, Dublin) in 1831. The formal creation, according to Leigh Rayment, was 30 September 1831, but it must have been known about earlier as The Times (of London) in its edition of 23 May 1831 reporting the result of the Dublin election, referred to Harty as a Baronet.\nIn the UK General Election of 1831 Harty was, on 19 May 1831, declared elected to one of the two seats for Dublin City. The defeated Tory candidates presented an election petition against Harty and his colleague Louis Perrin. The Whig MPs were unseated in August and a new election ordered. Harty was never again to stand for election to Parliament.\nHe was married to Elizabeth, the daughter of John Davis of Eden Park and Prospect House, Co. Dublin; by his wife, Mary, daughter of Charles Jones (d.1788) of Killincarrig House, Co. Wicklow. They had 4 sons and 3 daughters. He was succeeded in his title consecutively by his eldest son, Robert and his youngest son, Henry Lockington.\nHis daughter Emma-Jane Adelaide (1828\u20131919) married George Henry Haigh DL JP (1829\u20131887, Repton, Trinity College Cambridge) of The Shay, Halifax, and Grainsby Hall, Lincs in 1859. The Haighs were a fabulously wealthy family who had made their fortune in the industrial revolution (as mill owners, merchants and bankers) and were busy transforming themselves into the upper ranks of the landed gentry. Apart from owning huge estates in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire they also owned a large country house in Merionethshire called \"Aber I\u00e2\". This property was later made famous as Portmeirion by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis. Their eldest son was George Henry Caton Haigh (1860\u20131941).", "link_mentions": []}}
