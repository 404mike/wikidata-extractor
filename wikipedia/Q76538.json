This has been the case with some players such as Aiden McGeady and Jack Collison who have chosen to play for the country of their parental heritage rather than the country of their birth. Players from crown dependencies (i.e. the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), which are technically not in the UK, are eligible for all four teams (e.g. Matt Le Tissier and Graeme Le Saux, both of whom opted for England), as were British citizens born outside the UK or its possessions \u2013 Eric Young (born in Singapore) and Pat van den Hauwe (born in Belgium) had previously opted for Wales under the same rulePat Van den Hauwe: Kendall told me to pick Wales, Nil Satis Nisi Optimum, 23 October 2015Eric Young went from non league to the international stage via Brighton and Crystal Palace, In Parallel Lines, 26 November 2017 and Maik Taylor (born in Germany to a British father) used it to represent Northern Ireland \u2013 but residency criteria now also apply."]}, {"page": "Linvoy Primus", "response": ["In the second game of the 1994\u201395 season against Leyton Orient, Primus made his debut as a substitute coming on for the injured Mark Newson.

He went on to say that he was \"weighed down by the burden of expectation\" and heard someone say he was the \"worst player we've ever had at Barnet\". He was often nervous before matches and recited the Lord's Prayer as a way of coping with his anxiety. At the end of the season, Primus was runner-up in the voting for the Player of the Season and was man of the match on several occasions. Barnet had a poor start to the next season and they were at the bottom of the table in mid-September. After beating Northampton Town 2\u20130, Barnet went on an 11-game winning streak which ended at Colchester United despite Primus scoring a goal. He would go on to score five goals in the season; more than any other season in his career.

At the end of that season he signed a new two-year contract with Birmingham, intending to compete for a first-team place. He finally dislodged Taylor in late 2005, but a 4\u20131 defeat at Manchester City, in which he conceded a penalty and was later sent off, proved to be his last first-team appearance before he was released at the end of the 2005\u201306 season due to Birmingham's relegation."]}, {"page": "Mat Sadler", "response": ["In the 2007\u201308 season saw Sadler suffered a knock and Achilles problem to the start of the season.

Sadler then provided assist for Garry O'Connor in the 27th minute, in the first round of League Cup, in a 2\u20131 win over Hereford United on 28 August 2007. However, Sadler struggled for the first team place after losing his left-back position to Franck Queudrue and Liam Ridgewell. As a result, Sadler was sent to play in the reserve. But in December, Sadler returned to the first team in the left-back position in his first league appearance since December, in a 2\u20131 loss against Newcastle United on 8 December 2007. However, on his next appearance against Reading, Sadler came under criticism when his back-pass short led to goalkeeper Maik Taylor brought down Stephen Hunt in the penalty box, leading Hunt to take the penalty himself and converted the penalty successfully.

However, Mensah's start to his Sunderland career has been hampered with the constant reoccurrence of a calf injury. It was not until on 21 November 2009 when he returned to the starting line\u2013up, helping Sunderland win 1\u20130 win against Arsenal. However, his return was short\u2013lived when Mensah was sidelined with another calf injury.

Four days later on 19 December 2009, Mensah scored his first Sunderland goal, in a 4\u20133 loss against Manchester City. So far Notwithstanding, teammate Michael Turner described Mensah as the best defender he has ever played with. Mensah became a favourite amongst the Sunderland faithful, but his injury problems meant he would struggle to play much in the upcoming season. Despite this, Mensah continued to remain involved in the starting eleven for the side throughout the 2009\u201310 season.
