Over a thirty-year career he wrote for and edited: The Scotsman, The Herald, The Sunday Herald, the Daily Record and The Times Literary Supplement. He was named Scotland's columnist of the year four times between 2000 and 2012.

The Lives of Bob Dylan, page 327. Bell also notes that the song echoes the imagery of \"The Drunken Boat /Le Bateau ivre\" by Arthur Rimbaud: \"I know skies split by lightning, waterspouts/ And undertows, and tides: I know the night/ And dawn exulting like a crowd of doves\".", "Bell asserts that \"Chimes\" was \"certainly something new, but also something flawed\".Ian Bell (2012). The Lives of Bob Dylan, page 329. He describes the song as both thrilling and \"loosely and horribly overwritten\". Bell suggests the theme of the song is that liberty took many forms, personal and political, civic and artistic, spiritual and physical. The significance of \"Chimes\" for Bell is that, although the song is too over-wrought and self-conscious to be a total success, it showed Dylan demolishing the barrier between poetry and song:", "Anyone reading \"Chimes\" on the tyrannical page might pause before calling it a poem. Anyone listening would hesitate to call it just a song in the manner of \"She Loves You\" or anything written for the mass market in the 20th century .
