By his own admission, his greatest regret was not playing on The Beatles' \"Eleanor Rigby\".Walker was recruited into ELO after founding member Roy Wood quit the band and took cellist Hugh McDowell and horn player/keyboardist Bill Hunt with him and also joining at the time on bass was Mike de Albuquerque. Their new bandmates were singer/songwriter/guitarist/bandleader Jeff Lynne, drummer Bev Bevan, keyboardist Richard Tandy (who had previously played bass, but switched to keyboards), violinist Wilf Gibson and cellist Mike Edwards and, at the time, Walker lived in a bachelor flat in the London suburb of Queen's Park.During his time in ELO, Walker played cello on two of their albums - ELO 2 and side two of On the Third Day - and he used a German-made cello with steel strings. He also contributed cello to the single Showdown.\nAfter leaving ELO, Walker joined the orchestra at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. He played cello on \"Fool's Gold\", a track on the album Thought Talk by the rock band Starry Eyed and LaughingWalker has also worked as a teacher.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Electric Light Orchestra", "response": ["ELO's debut concert took place on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey, with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards/French horn), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not be heard over the electric instruments. However, Arden would manage Wizzard, despite Wood's negative comments towards Arden. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively."]}, {"page": "On the Third Day", "response": ["On the Third Day was released in 1973 and failed to enter the UK charts at the time, although it did reach the US charts at number 52.

On The Third Day contains shorter tracks than its predecessor, but the four songs on side one of the album were linked into a continuous suite.
