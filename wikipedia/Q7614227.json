He is best known for playing bass guitar for the UK punk rock band The Shapes. He also played for many other bands, the most notable being the NWOBHM bands Rogue Male and HellsBelles. For a short time in the early 1980s, he was also a member of British R&B band The Mosquitos, with guitarist Steve Walwyn of Dr. Feelgood and Eddie and the Hot Rods, and can be seen on the cover of The Mosquitos only single \"Somethin' Outta Nothin'\". A prolific session player, he appears both credited and uncreditied on many releases throughout the 1980s and early 1990s under both his real and stage name. He was one of the first bassists in the nascent UK punk scene to adopt the Rickenbacker bass guitar which he still uses to this day. He was also one of the first bass guitarists in the world to use Trace Elliot amplification. His bass playing style is characterized by a very fast precise pick attack, and fast runs. Unusually for a bass guitarist, he sometimes utilizes an overhand tapping technique more common to six string players. He continues to play professionally, reverting between his real name and his stage name as the fancy takes him. He is also a professional skydiving coach and instructor, currently holding seven world records in the sport. He can be seen in  an episode  of MythBusters aired on the Discovery Channel taking presenter Kari Byron skydiving whilst testing the falling airplane blue ice myth. He is also a vegetarian. He can be seen in the independent film Six Sex Scenes and a Murder, in the role of the bounty hunter. He currently resides in California, where he plays bass for the San Francisco Bay Area band Ghosthookers. Ghosthookers released a record in 2008 which features Brian Helicopter on bass under his real name."]}, {"page": "Denim on Ice", "response": ["* Steve Walwyn \u2013 Guitar"]}, {"page": "Cupid's Inspiration", "response": ["By 1978, the band began writing and recording heavier rock songs.  These were performed under a different name, initially '4 Wheel Drive', which they soon changed to 'Chevy', to avoid alienating Cupid's Inspiration fans. They recruited Steve Walwyn, later of Dr. Feelgood to give a \"twin guitar\" sound.  As 'Chevy' they toured supporting bands such as Alvin Lee, Hawkwind and Gillan. Chevy recorded two BBC In Concert Programmes, issued three singles: \"Too Much Loving\" / \"See the Light\", \"The Taker\" / \"Life on the Run\" and \"Just Another Day\" / \"Rock On\" and one album The Taker, released in September 1980."]}, {"page": "Gasoline Days", "response": ["Gasoline Days is the fifth studio album released by Pub Rock band Eddie and the Hot Rods.

Former guitarist Gypie Mayo returned for a string of dates as the band continued their European tour, before Russell left permanently after a short French run in May and Steve Walwyn joined in his place.
