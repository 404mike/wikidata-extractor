Only one fatality was sustained, a worker named William Aplin who died only three days before the tunnel opened when he was struck by a landslide outside one of the tunnel entrances. He was memorialised with a stone marked with a white cross which can still be seen in situ. The tunnel reduced the road's gradient from 1-in-6 (17%) to 1-in-10 (10%) and shortened it by a mile (1.6 km), as well as lowering its maximum elevation by . At the time of its opening, only a handful of road tunnels had been built in Britain; it pre-dates the construction of the first railway tunnels, and it is now the only pre-railway road tunnel in the country still in use."]}, {"page": "Michael Lane", "response": ["Michael Lane may refer to:", "*Michael Lane (character) (active since 2007), recurring character in Azrael comics", "*Michael Lane (engineer) (1802\u20131868), British civil engineer", "*Michael Lane (Royal Navy officer) (active since 2010), British politician and police commissioner", "*J.
