Thus in this historical sense, Lords of Manors are barons, or freemen; however they are not entitled to be styled as such. John Selden writes in Titles of Honour, \"The word Baro (Latin for Baron) hath been also so much communicated, that not only all Lords of Mannors have been from ancient time, and are at this day called sometimes Barons (as in the stile of their Court Barons, which is Curia Baronis, &c.

At this time, there were few books written in English held in the library, partially because academic work was not done in English. Thomas James suggested that Bodley should ask the Stationers' Company to provide a copy of all books printed to the Bodleian and in 1610 Bodley made an agreement with the company to put a copy of every book registered with them in the library.

Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \"appeal to reason\" and John Selden's \"appeal to contract\", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.", "On 17 May 1636, Hale was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn, and immediately became the pupil of William Noy.Hostettler (2002) p.12 Hale and Noy became close friends, to the point where he was referred to as \"the young Noy\",Burnet (1820) p.12 and more crucially he also met and befriended John Selden, a \"man of almost universal learning, whose theories were to dominate much of [Hale's] later thought\".Cromartie (1995) p.3 Selden persuaded him to continue with his studies outside the law, and much of Hale's written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory.Holdsworth (1923) p.403 Hale gained a good legal practice, although he allowed his Christian faith to govern his work.

Coke asserted that judge-made law had the answer to any question asked of it, and as a result, \"a learned judge... was the natural arbiter of politics\".Cromartie (1995) p.17 This principle was known as the \"appeal to reason\", with \"reason\" referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's theory meant that certainty of the law and \"intellectual beauty\" was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable.Cromartie (1995) p.19 John Selden held similar beliefs, in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England. However, he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to play with it, and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law was nothing more than a contract made by the English people; this is known as the \"appeal to contract\".Cromartie (1995) p.32 Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke's theory. Along with Francis Bacon, he argued for natural law, created by the King's authority, not by any individual judge. Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers, and that the law could be understood not through Coke's \"reason\" (the method used by lawyers) but through understanding the King's instructions.

Ethics. Everyman's Library JM Dent, London. 1948. Part 2 proposition 35. Part 3 proposition 11.

The Great Philosophers. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. London. 2000. p. 141.

Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science.Georg Hegel. Philosophy of Right. Knox TM trans, Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1942. para 137. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the \"constitutional monarch\" and the \"universal moral faculty\": \"conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it.\"Joseph Butler \"Sermons\" in The Works of Joseph Butler. (Gladstone WE ed), Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1896, Vol II p. 71. Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first, \"self-love\" (seeking individual happiness) and second, \"benevolence\" (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions).Henry Sidgwick.

Pococke does not seem to have been an extreme churchman or to have been active in politics. His rare scholarship and personal qualities brought him influential friends, foremost among these being John Selden and John Owen. Through their offices he obtained, in 1648, the chair of Hebrew, though he lost the emoluments of the post soon after, and did not recover them till the Restoration."]}, {"page": "Eadmer", "response": ["Eadmer left a large number of writings, the most important of which is his Historia novorum in Anglia, a work which deals mainly with the history of England between 1066 and 1122. Although concerned principally with ecclesiastical affairs, the Historia, scholars agree, is as one of the ablest and most valuable writings of its kind. It was first edited by John Selden in 1623 and, with Eadmer's Vita Anselmi, was edited by Martin Rule for the Rolls Series (London, 1884). R. W. Southern re-edited Vita Anselmi in 1963 with a facing page translation, and Geoffrey Bosanquet translated the Rolls text of Historia Novorum in 1964."]}]}}
