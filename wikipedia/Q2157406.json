Robert Gunther was educated at University College School, attached to University College London. Towards the end of his schooling he attended lectures at University College itself. He was elected to a four-year demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1887 and took this up in 1888. He joined the Oxford University Scientific Club in his first term at Magdalen and subsequently he took up a Fellowship at the College.\nIn 1911, Gunther and his family moved to 5 Folly Bridge, an unusual and distinctive tall house on a small island in the River Thames next to the bridge. This made the river central to his life. He was a pioneer of environmental conservation in Oxford.\nFrom 1923, Robert Gunther produced a fourteen volume set of books on Early Science in Oxford, his magnum opus, the last appearing in 1945. These were initially produced under the auspices of the Oxford Historical Society and printed at the Clarendon Press, Oxford. A fifteenth volume by his son A. E. Gunther in 1967 covered Robert Gunther himself.Between 1926 and 1930, Gunther founded the Museum of the History of Science in the Old Ashmolean building, with some difficulty: it is apparent that few of his contemporaries shared his passion for historical scientific instruments, and indeed the Early Science series makes barbed comments about the failure of predecessors in various august bodies to preserve such things. The museum's initial collection was based on the scientific instrument collection of his friend Lewis Evans, donated in 1924.\nGunther died after a short illness, while staying at a friend's house in the south Oxfordshire village of South Stoke. He and his wife, Amy, are buried at Heacham, Norfolk, in the Rolfe family plot, having written their family history. He was succeeded as Curator of the Museum of the History of Science by Frank Sherwood Taylor.\nAn archive of manuscripts collected by Gunther is held by the Museum of the History of Science.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of science and technology", "response": ["*Robert Gunther (1869\u20131940)"]}, {"page": "Robert Hooke", "response": ["Perhaps more significantly, Hooke and Isaac Newton disputed over credit for certain breakthroughs in physical science, including gravitation, astronomy, and optics. After Hooke's death, Newton questioned his legacy. And as the Royal Society's president, Newton allegedly destroyed or failed to preserve the only known portrait of Hooke. In the 20th century, researchers Robert Gunther and Margaret  revived Hooke's legacy, establishing Hooke among the most influential scientists of his time.See, for example, the 2003 Hooke meeting at the University of Oxford: ", "**Robert Gunther's Early Science in Oxford, a history of science in Oxford during the Protectorate, Restoration and Age of Enlightenment, devotes five of its fourteen volumes to Hooke."]}, {"page": "Boyle's law", "response": ["*  Robert Boyle acknowledged his debts to Towneley and Power in:  R.

Available on-line at:   Spain's La Biblioteca Virtual de Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico.  On pages 50, 55\u201356, and 64, Boyle cited experiments by Towneley and Power showing that air expands as the ambient pressure decreases.  On p. 63, Boyle acknowledged Towneley's help in interpreting Boyle's data from experiments relating the pressure to the volume of a quantity of air.  (Also, on p. 64, Boyle acknowledged that Lord Brouncker had also investigated the same subject.) Robert Boyle confirmed their discovery through experiments and published the results.R. Boyle, A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, \u2026 (London:  Thomas Robinson, 1662).  Available on-line at:   Spain's La Biblioteca Virtual de Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico.  Boyle presents his law in \"Chap. V.  Two new experiments touching the measure of the force of the spring of air compress'd and dilated.\", pp. 57\u201368.  On p. 59, Boyle concludes that \" \u2026 the same air being brought to a degree of density about twice as that it had before, obtains a spring twice as strong as formerly.\"  That is, doubling the density of a quantity of air doubles its pressure.  Since air's density is proportional to its pressure, then for a fixed quantity of air, the product of its pressure and its volume is constant.  On page 60, he presents his data on the compression of air:  \"A Table of the Condensation of the Air.\"  The legend (p. 60) accompanying the table states:  \"E.  What the pressure should be according to the Hypothesis, that supposes the pressures and expansions to be in reciprocal relation.\"  On p. 64, Boyle presents his data on the expansion of air:  \"A Table of the Rarefaction of the Air.\"  According to Robert Gunther and other authorities, it was Boyle's assistant, Robert Hooke, who built the experimental apparatus.  Boyle's law is based on experiments with air, which he considered to be a fluid of particles at rest in between small invisible springs. At that time, air was still seen as one of the four elements, but Boyle disagreed. Boyle's interest was probably to understand air as an essential element of life;The Boyle Papers BP 9, fol. 75v\u201376r at BBK.ac.uk  for example, he published works on the growth of plants without air.The Boyle Papers, BP 10, fol. 138v\u2013139r at BBK.ac.uk  Boyle used a closed J-shaped tube and after pouring mercury from one side he forced the air on the other side to contract under the pressure of mercury. After repeating the experiment several times and using different amounts of mercury he found that under controlled conditions, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume occupied by it. The French physicist Edme Mariotte (1620\u20131684) discovered the same law independently of Boyle in 1679,See:"]}, {"page": "Corpus Christi College, Oxford", "response": ["The dial has required regular maintenance throughout existence.

Like the Queens' College Chichester elms in Cambridge, the Magdalen College trees were not observed to produce root suckers, though The Grove at Magdalen has long been a deer park, and any sucker growth is likely to have been cropped. The Oxford zoologist Robert Gunther attributed the larger tree's unusual size to the fact (discovered in 1926) that it had been growing on a phosphate-rich bone-bed, made up of the remains of mammoths and other prehistoric animals.Gunther, R.
