In 1935 Evans captained Newport against the touring New Zealand team.\nEvans made his one and only international appearance against England in the 1934 Home Nations Championship, and was given the captaincy. He was one of 13 new caps to play for Wales, with only Claude Davey and Dai Thomas with any past international experience. Wales came a poor second, losing 9-0. The selectors were severely criticized for their choice, not only because of the teams inexperience, but also because seven of the team played their rugby outside Wales. Evans was one of five players from the Welsh team that day that became one cap wonders.\nEvans was killed in action while serving his country in North Africa during the Second World War.
