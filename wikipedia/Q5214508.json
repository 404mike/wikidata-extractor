The situation for England did not improve, however. Dan Tremelling replaced Hufton in goal for his solitary England appearance, whilst defenders Alf Baker (Arsenal) and Reg Osborne (Leicester City) were given their first (and only) chances at international level. England were soon behind to a goal from Wilf Lewis, and after 40 minutes Hill deflected a cross into his own net. In the second half, Roy Goodall had the chance to bring England back into the game but missed his penalty. When England finally scored, this was an own goal as Fred Keenor deflected Louis Page's corner past Bert Gray in the Welsh goal.

(1875\u20131965)", "response": ["Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons in all, but most of them were spent in the bottom half of the table. Consistency of selection played a part in the 1920s; six\u00a0\u2013 Womack, Bradford, Crosbie, Dan Tremelling, Percy Barton and Liddell\u00a0\u2013 of the  fifteen men with more than 300 league appearances for the club played most of their matches in that decade.Matthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 471\u201372. Much reliance was placed on Tremelling and then on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs to make up for the lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 15\u201317. Under Liddell's management, the makeup of the side never settled. He used 70 players over his six seasons in charge (in contrast to the 55 used in the first six First Division seasons in the 1920sMatthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 284\u201395.), and after narrowly avoiding relegation three times in 1934, 1935 and 1938, Birmingham were finally relegated in 1938\u201339, the last full season before the Second World War.

Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept them in the First Division, albeit in the lower half of the table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager."]}, {"page": "Frank Richards (football manager)", "response": ["Richards joined the St Andrew's office staff in 1907. The 1911 Census records him as assistant secretary, living in Fourth Avenue, Small Heath; his 15-year-old son Sam was also on the office staff. Richards was appointed club secretary later that year, and took over responsibility for team affairs in 1915 when the Football League was suspended because of the First World War. He oversaw the signing of a number of players who went on to give excellent service to Birmingham, including record goalscorer Joe Bradford, playmaker Johnny Crosbie, future manager George Liddell and England international goalkeeper Dan Tremelling; those four between them made over 1,500 Football League appearances for the club. In 1920\u201321 he led Birmingham to the championship of the Second Division. They failed to enter the 1921\u201322 FA Cup after Richards forgot to send in the forms in time to be exempt from qualifying, and the Football Association proved impervious to appeals for clemency; although that did not preclude their entering the competition in the qualifying rounds, the directors chose not to. In 1923, after two years in the top flight, Richards handed over responsibility for playing matters to former player Billy Beer, remaining as club secretary for a further two years."]}, {"page": "Stan Hauser", "response": ["Hauser was born in Handsworth, South Yorkshire, now part of Sheffield.
