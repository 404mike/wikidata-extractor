He sang the tenor role in many operas, including Don Giovanni, The Bartered Bride, Tosca, Mignon, Faust, Carmen and Die Fledermaus, as well as newer works such as Erich Korngold's Die tote Stadt and Wilhelm Kienzl's Der Evangelimann. Daniel O'Hara's Tauber Chronology lists 100 roles in opera and operetta that he performed on stage. It was in June 1919 that he made the first of over seven hundred gramophone records. All his vocal recordings were made for the Odeon Records label, and after 1933 for the associated Parlophone label. Tauber had a lyrical, flexible tenor voice, and he sang with a warm, elegant legato. His excellent breath control gave him a wonderful head voice and messa di voce with a superb pianissimo. He was elegant in appearance too \u2013 although he had a slight squint in his right eye; he disguised it by wearing a monocle which, when accompanied by a top hat, added to the elegant effect."]}, {"page": "The Record of Singing", "response": ["*A British Born Trio: Edward Johnson (1878\u20131959) (actually born in Canada), Alfred Piccaver (1883\u20131958), Joseph Hislop (1884\u20131977)"]}, {"page": "Long Sutton, Lincolnshire", "response": ["*Alfred Piccaver (1884\u20131958), operatic tenor, was born in Long Sutton."]}, {"page": "State Opera (Prague)", "response": ["Performances commenced on 5 January 1888 with Richard Wagner's opera Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg.
