The fight was billed as a World Featherweight Title, and went an astounding eighty rounds, though it was officially declared a draw. Some sources may credit Weir with taking the World Title as early as 1887 in his knockout title wins over Jack Farrell in Ridgefield, New Jersey on January 24, or Jack Williams in Westerly Rhode, Island, on March 10.  Weir first claimed the title in his win over Farrell.\nHe was recognized by most sources to have lost the title on January 13, 1890 to Torpedo Billy Murphy in a fourteenth-round knockout in San Francisco, California.", "link_mentions": {}}}
