He wrote several essays and books including on topics of erysipelas, eye surgery and on the effects of anaesthesia and hydrocyanic acid. \nAfter studying in Paris he settled in Leeds, where he became attached to the Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Leeds School of Medicine, where he taught surgery and anatomy. In 1864 he became surgeon to the Leeds Infirmary. He opposed Joseph Lister's antisepsis and did not believe in the germ-theory of wound infections. He served as a witness in civil and criminal cases, including being first witness in the trial of William Palmer.", "link_mentions": []}}
