Her work is informed by the discarded resources of daily life, especially with respect to the re-use and recycling of obsolete materials. This is reflected in her transformation of objects such as old tools, implements and vehicles into sculptures through the application of broken tableware, shattered glass and jewels to their surfaces.\nIn 2008 Schwegmann-Fielding received an 'International Research Fellowship for The Contemporary Crafts' and travelled to India where she met and worked with Nek Chand at the Rock Garden of Chandigarh in India. She cites Chand as having had an influence on her practice along with the work of the kutchi Artisans of India. Of her own sculpture Schwegmann-Fielding says that \"adornment is central to my working process, essentially giving an unwanted object a second skin. Covering abandoned tools and utensils amongst other things, with broken crockery, glass and jewellery.\"She has worked with Channel 4, BBC Television, London Zoo, Kunstsymposium, Kleinbreitenbach, (1999, 2006, 2012) \u2013 Schloss Elisabethenburg, Braintree Museum, Kent History and Library Centre, Symington Building, Writtle College, Vorsicht Kunst, Meiningen and Arts Reverie, Gujarat, India and is a professional member of BAMM (The British Association for Modern Mosaic).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colchester", "response": ["*Anne Schwegmann-Fielding (born 1967) \u2013 sculptor and mosaic artist"]}, {"page": "University of Wolverhampton", "response": ["Other notable alumni include: Sir Terence Beckett, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry; Sir Charles Wheeler, sculptor and President of the Royal Academy; Suzi Perry, television presenter and journalist; Maggie Gee, novelist; Trevor Beattie, advertising executive; Peter Bebb, special effect artist;\"Graduate hopes for Oscar win\", University of Wolverhampton, 22 February 2011.
