On its demise, Damon freelanced and was engaged as a continuity announcer by ATV London and ABC Manchester. He also contributed to BBC Radio 2's 'Roundabout' programme. He returned to Australia for 5 years awaiting the start of independent radio, during which time Damon announced for both radio and television stations including being a member of the \"Snob Mob\" at 2CH in Sydney.\nDamon came back to the UK, worked for Southern Television and was part of the original team at Capital Radio for over 5 years using his real name of Ian Davidson. He was the face of the \"Fun Bus\" \u2013 broadcasting live and promoting the station all around London and the Home Counties. On his London Link programme, Damon broadcast to radio stations around the Commonwealth from Australia to Canada, Hong Kong to Barbados.\nIn the 80s and 90s, after a stint at Blue Danube Radio in Austria, Damon worked for provincial stations in England including Pennine Radio, LBC, Essex Radio, Radio Mercury, Radio 210, KFM Tonbridge and Delta FM/ Wey Valley Radio. Before moving to Norfolk in 2002, Damon was at County Sound radio in Guildford.From May 2005 to September 2008 Damon presented Sunday programmes on Big L 1395.Originally Damon presented the Solid Gold Sunday 1400 \u2013 1800 when the station was called Radio London International (named after the original offshore station). A change of management meant Ian's show was moved to a later slot and the programme changed format. However, in the summer of 2008 Damon's programme returned to its original slot and format but this was only to be for a short time as when the station faced financial difficulties Damon left due to the agreed promised payment not being forthcoming for his services.Damon also was part of Pirate BBC Essex broadcasting from the LV18 lightship in Harwich in 2004 and again in 2007 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the closure of the offshore stations.\nIn August 2009 Damon joined community station Wayland Radio to host a weekly Sunday afternoon show for the station before the station closed due to lack of finance.In July 2014 Damon joined the annual short term station Red Sands Radio to host a weekly Sunday afternoon soul show for the station's Solid Gold Sunday outlet", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Davidson", "response": ["*Ian Damon (Ian Davidson, born 1935), Australian broadcaster and disc jockey"]}, {"page": "Wonderful Radio London", "response": ["The disc jockeys included Chuck Blair, Tony Blackburn, Pete Brady, Tony Brandon, Dave Cash (who also teamed up to present a popular Kenny and Cash Show), Ian Damon, Chris Denning, Dave Dennis, Pete Drummond, John Edward, Kenny Everett (co-host of the Kenny and Cash Show, and ultimately fired for continual on-air criticism of the religious programme, The World Tomorrow), Graham Gill, Bill Hearne, Duncan Johnson, Paul Kaye (who became the main news reader), Lorne King, \"Marshall\" Mike Lennox, John Peel (see The Perfumed Garden), Earl Richmond, Mark Roman, John Sedd, Keith Skues, Ed Stewart, Norman St. John, Tommy Vance (who came to the station via Radio Caroline South and had been on KHJ Los Angeles), Richard Warner, Willy Walker, Alan West, Tony Windsor (who had begun his offshore career with Radio Atlanta) and John Yorke."]}, {"page": "Wombat (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Ian Damon (born 1935), Australian/UK broadcaster, nicknamed \"Wombat\""]}, {"page": "Ian Davidson (disc jockey)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Damon"]}, {"page": "Ian Davidson (broadcaster)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Damon"]}]}}
