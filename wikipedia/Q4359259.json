At the Guernsey Festival tournament of 2010, he won the event on tie-break from Grandmasters Tiger Hillarp Persson and Evgeny Sveshnikov. This brought his run of undefeated games, since the 2008 British Championship, to fifty-two.\nIn 2015, Pert tied for 2nd\u20134th with David Howell and Daniel Gormally, finishing third on tiebreak, in the British Chess Championship and later that year, he finished runner-up in the inaugural British Knockout Championship, which was held alongside the London Chess Classic.
