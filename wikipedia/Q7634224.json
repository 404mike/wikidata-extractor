Alma is often the motherly, sympathetic, liberal-minded character in many storylines, particularly off-setting her husband Mike's often harsh and high-minded attitudes. Mike's patronising and chauvinistic mannerisms alienate Alma at times; she occasionally rebels, buying herself a 1979 MG Midget convertible and seeking employment against his wishes. Alma considers straying briefly with Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce) - son of Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and Gail's half-brother - in 1996. She makes a pass at him but is rebuffed and is hurt further when Mike responds with nonchalance to the incident. She is then caught up in the plight of Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff). Alma feels sympathy for Don after Mike sells him a garage business at a knowingly inflated price and then watches him go bankrupt. Don eventually has a breakdown, becoming obsessed with revenge on Mike. After attempting to frame Mike for arson and insurance fraud, he kidnaps Alma, driving her into the river in his taxi; both survive.
