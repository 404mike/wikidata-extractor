However, he only played 13 senior games for City in four years, and in the summer of 1952 he joined Chesterfield. All of his appearances for City came in the 1949\u201350 season, and he was in goals for the short period between the careers of Frank Swift and Bert Trautmann.Powell missed only two league games in his first season with Chesterfield, and he went on to make 471 league appearances for them, and 508 matches in total, in a 12-year career with the club. In 1958 his run of playing 284 consecutive league games for the club was halted when Gordon Banks played. His playing career was ended in December 1964 following a car crash which killed his team-mate Ralph Hunt, and which also injured Doug Wragg and Peter Stringfellow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["Banks was given his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, at the expense of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2\u20132, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the following match; by the end of the 1958\u201359 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coach to guide him, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for \u00a37,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to \u00a315 a week."]}, {"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["| Crash occurred on the return journey to watch future opponents Peterborough United with teammates Peter Stringfellow (who was driving), Ron Powell and Doug Wragg."]}, {"page": "Powell (surname)", "response": ["*Ron Powell (1929\u20131992), Welsh goalkeeper who played for Chesterfield"]}, {"page": "Ralph Hunt (footballer)", "response": ["Hunt grew up in a football family and was the brother of Denis Hunt and the nephew of Douglas Hunt.
