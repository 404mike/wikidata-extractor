Constance Tipper of Cambridge University demonstrated that the fractures did not start in the welds, but were due to low temperature embrittlement of the steel used;Constance Tipper (researcher into Liberty ship fracture) however, the same steel used in riveted construction did not have this problem. She discovered that the steel the ships were made from changed from being ductile to becoming brittle, allowing cracks to start and propagate easily, at temperatures below the critical ductile-brittle transition temperature; ships in the North Atlantic were exposed to temperatures that could fall below this critical point. The predominantly welded hull construction, effectively a continuous sheet of steel, allowed small cracks to propagate unimpeded, unlike in a hull made of separate plates riveted together. One common type of crack nucleated at the square corner of a hatch which coincided with a welded seam, both the corner and the weld acting as stress concentrators. Furthermore, the ships were frequently grossly overloaded, increasing stress, and some of the problems occurred during or after severe storms  that would further have increased stress. Minor revisions to the hatches and various reinforcements were applied to the Liberty ships to arrest the cracking problem. The successor Victory ships used the same steel, also welded rather than riveted, but spacing between frames was widened from  to , making the ships less stiff and more able to flex.", "* Summary of Constance Tipper's workcontains remarkable photo of fractured Liberty ship still afloat."]}, {"page": "1894 in science", "response": ["* February 16 \u2013 Constance Tipper, n\u00e9e Elam (died 1995), English metallurgist."]}, {"page": "Newnham College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Constance Tipper"]}, {"page": "1995 in science", "response": ["* December 14 \u2013 Constance Tipper (b. 1894), English metallurgist."]}, {"page": "Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge", "response": ["King was appointed by Gordon Brown, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in March 2007 to lead the King Review to examine the vehicle and fuel technologies that, over the next 25 years, could help to reduce carbon emissions from road transport.Julia King career biography  The interim analytical report was published in October 2007,King Review of low-carbon cars issues analytical report  and the final recommendations in March 2008.
