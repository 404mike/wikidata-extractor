In May 1922 he, Darrell Figgis, and Col. Maurice George Moore met with the Irish Farmers' Union to see what action farmers would take regarding the nomination of independent candidates at the general election. This was seen by \u00c9amon de Valera as an attempt to break up his election pact with Michael Collins.\nHe was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1922 general election but he was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as an Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Cork Borough constituency at the 1923 general election. He was elected under the label of Cork Progressive Association, a group associated with the Business and Professional Group. He did not contest the June 1927 general election.Though largely supporting the Cumann na nGaedheal government, he rarely spoke in the D\u00e1il. Bills with which he concerned himself included those on the courts of justice, intoxicating liquor, and local government (1923\u201325). He advocated a central road board responsible for all road construction in the state; was highly critical of the low standard of education in the agricultural colleges; and, as a member of the D\u00e1il committee on wireless broadcasting (1924), totally opposed any project involving public expenditure on broadcasting as a medium of entertainment. Beamish was governor of the Munster Institute for many years, a freeman of London (1918), a fellow of the Linnean Society, and a renowned horticulturist: his garden contained some of the rarest shrubs and plants. At Glounthaune he had a small home farm where, following the Howenheim system of intense grass cultivation, he grazed a herd of Kerry cattle.In 1924, he spoke against the conduct of the Cork Corporation during a public inquiry, held in the Cork Courthouse. He was supported by the Cork Progressive Association, who had successfully lobbied the government to instigate the inquiry. He was critical of then Lord Mayor, Sean French, who was present at the inquiry. He was a trenchant critic of the city council, seeing it dissolved in 1923; though elected to the reconstituted council (June 1930), he did not attend any meetings from December 1931 onwards.He was the eldest child of Richard Pigott Beamish and his wife Hulda Elizabeth Constance. Beamish studied agriculture in Sweden (1881\u201387). After a study trip to Denmark, he wrote a treatise, \u2018An improved method of feeding milch cows\u2019, the findings of which were subsequently introduced into Sweden. Later he wrote a treatise on the content of butter.Beamish probably joined the Beamish and Crawford brewery shortly after his return to Ireland, and in 1899 he became the acting partner of the Beamish family. Beamish became chairman and managing director (1901\u201330); during his stewardship the firm acquired the Dungarvan brewery (1906) and Allman, Dowden & Co., Bandon (1914), and entered a joint venture with John Walsh, MP, manufacturing aerated waters (1914). After the first world war the high rate of duty on beer led to a drop in consumption which, with industrial relations problems, saw the company in a serious predicament, not alleviated until after Beamish retired (1930).He married Violet Campbell in October 1903. They had one son and two daughters. The family resided at Ashbourne, Glounthaune, County Cork, and in 1931 Beamish moved to England; there he in Kensington, London, and later in Weybridge, Surrey. After his death, his estate in Ireland was worth \u00a3674.He was Sheriff of Cork City in 1907 and 1911. The Richard Beamish Cricket Grounds (more commonly known as The Mardyke) is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Se\u00e1n French (1890\u20131937)", "response": ["French was Lord Mayor of Cork from 1924 to 1929 and again from 1932 until his death in 1937. French clashed with the Cork Progressive Association (CPA), a lobbyist group made up of businessmen and disgruntled citizens, who had successfully persuaded the government to instigate a public inquiry into the conduct of the Cork Corporation in 1924. French expressed the view that the Government was merely trying discredit the Council for electing a Republican mayor. The sworn inquiry began on 26 August 1924 in the Cork Courthouse. Richard Beamish, TD and city councillor, supported by the CPA, heavily criticised the Corporation\u2019s performance. Sir Stanley Harrington also of the CPA, gave evidence against the Corporation under French\u2019s mayoralty. French disputed the evidence and criticised The Cork Examiner for taking what he believed to be an anti-Corporation stance. Lord Mayor French was aggressively cross-examined by P. F Donegan, solicitor for the CPA, for three days. French often gave short, curt replies. French was also adept at parrying Donegan\u2019s questions. Presenting his evidence, French defended the members of the Corporation, claiming that they were \"sincerely doing their best.\" He also claimed that the people of Cork City were partly to blame for failures on the part of the Corporation, claiming that they were not sufficiently educated on local services and local affairs. French also frequently clashed with the City Manager, Philip Monahan, during his terms as Lord Mayor. His son, also called Se\u00e1n followed him into politics and served as both Lord Mayor and TD in Cork."]}, {"page": "Business and Professional Group", "response": ["It fielded five candidates in Dublin and Cork at the 1922 general election.
