He was capped nine times for Scotland between 1875\u201381, and is generally considered to be the youngest player ever to be capped for Scotland - he was seventeen years and thirty six days old when he was capped against England on 8 March 1875. He vies for this record with Charles Reid, who was the same age when capped - however, Reid had lived through an extra leap year day, when he was capped in 1881.", "link_mentions": {}}}
