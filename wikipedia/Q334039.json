Morse theory is an important tool which studies smooth manifolds by considering the critical points of differentiable functions on the manifold, demonstrating how the smooth structure of the manifold enters into the set of tools available.Milnor, J., 2016. Morse Theory.(AM-51), Volume 51. Princeton university press. Often times more geometric or analytical techniques may be used, by equipping a smooth manifold with a Riemannian metric or by studying a differential equation on it. Care must be taken to ensure that the resulting information is insensitive to this choice of extra structure, and so genuinely reflects only the topological properties of the underlying smooth manifold. For example, the Hodge theorem provides a geometric and analytical interpretation of the de Rham cohomology, and gauge theory was used by Simon Donaldson to prove facts about the intersection form of simply connected 4-manifolds.Donaldson, S.K., Donaldson, S.K. and Kronheimer, P.B., 1997.

In some cases techniques from contemporary physics may appear, such as topological quantum field theory, which can be used to compute topological invariants of smooth spaces."]}, {"page": "Diffeomorphism", "response": ["More unusual phenomena occur for 4-manifolds.

His best known result, the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem, was proved with Singer in 1963 and is used in counting the number of independent solutions to differential equations. Some of his more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics, in particular instantons and monopoles, which are responsible for some subtle corrections in quantum field theory.

For instance, Fields medalist Shing-Tung Yau said in 2019 that despite the \"brilliant\" and Fields Medal-worthy work of Perelman on the Ricci flow, some parts of his second preprint are not well-understood by the mathematical community, leaving the possibility of some unrecognized errors.Yau, Shing-Tung; Nadis, Steve.

The groundbreaking work of Simon Donaldson, for which he was later awarded the Fields medal, used the moduli space of instantons over a given four-dimensional differentiable manifold as a new invariant of the manifold that depends on its differentiable structure and applied it to the construction of homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic four-manifolds. Many methods developed in studying instantons have also been applied to monopoles. This is because magnetic monopoles arise as solutions of a dimensional reduction of the Yang\u2013Mills equations.See, for instance, Nigel Hitchin's paper \"Self-Duality Equations on Riemann Surface\"."]}]}}
