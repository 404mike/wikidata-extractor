Lehmann was not the first Australian whose name had been brought-up for discussion of the English job, as Tom Moody was also linked to the position. South Africa's Graham Ford, the Kent director of cricket, had also expressed an interest in filling the post. After having his name connected to the English cricket team, Lehmann was also linked to the New Zealand cricket team, as they were searching for coach as well, to succeed Andy Moles who had resigned in October 2009. Lehmann, Mark Greatbatch, and Jeff Crowe were shortlisted as candidates for the post with New Zealand Cricket, with Lehmann eventually losing-out to Greatbatch. Lehmann was then named coach of the Queensland team after Trevor Barsby's sudden exit in 2010. He took over as coach of the Twenty20 side to prepare for its opening match against Victoria. Under Lehmann's coaching, Queensland won the 2011/12 (110th) season of the Sheffield Shield, the Australian domestic first-class cricket competition; this was only their seventh victory since joining that competition in 1926. They had won six out of their ten Shield matches, lost two, and drew two matches. At the same time as he took up coaching Queensland, he also signed to the Brisbane Heat side, which competed in an expanded eight-team domestic Twenty20 competition. Once again Lehmann\u2019s old mate in the Australian team Shane Warne suggested to Cricket Australia that Lehmann would be a perfect coach for the young Australian cricket team.

Davis took three further wickets, finishing with his first five wicket haul for the club.

They made a solid start, reaching 59/1 after 90 minutes of play before Roger Twose in his fourth over took three wickets. Jamie Hall and Peter Moores (29) steadied the innings with a partnership of 42 but the wicket of Hall caused a collapse from 103/4 to 131 all out. Warwickshire lost two wickets in the remaining three overs. With the visitors on 67/5 the match was evenly poised but Dominic Ostler and Trevor Penney (24) put on 67 for the sixth wicket, Ostler was the only player to score a half-century in the match. A ninth wicket stand of 30 between Graeme Welch and Gladstone Small increased the lead past 50, substantial under the circumstances. Sussex lost regular wickets in their second innings and closed day two on 107/8 with top scoring Martin Speight unbeaten on 38. Tim Munton dismissed Speight with the second ball of the third day and shortly afterwards took the final wicket to finish with eight wickets in the match.

Lara's score was his ninth century for the club and took him past 2,000 runs for the season. Twose's innings of 137 took five hours and contained 19 boundaries.
