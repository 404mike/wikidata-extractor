It is, however, claimed that this trend of success in the field has not continued through to the second- and third-generation Guyanese Britons. The late Beryl Gilroy was a significant figure within the Afro-Caribbean diaspora in the UK. This highly respected Guyanese-born novelist became the first black headteacher of any school in the country. Another important literary figure of the Guyanese British community in the UK as a whole is John Agard, who is probably the most famous Black British poet and has been recognised with many awards. Pauline Melville's output of work has led to such awards as Guardian Fiction Prize, the Macmillan Silver Pen Award and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for best first book. Wilson Harris, who received the first ever Guyana Prize for Literature, has like many other Guyanese writers in the UK has been heavily influenced and inspired by the culture and history of his homeland. Indo-Guyanese writer David Dabydeen, a UK resident, has interests that encompass the slave-trading history of Guyana as well as contemporary Caribbean culture in the UK. Other writers, including Roy Heath and Michael Abbensetts, have helped create a greater knowledge of Guyanese culture in the UK. Other UK-based writers of Guyanese origin include Fred D'Aguiar, Mike Phillips,  Jan Shinebourne, Sharon Maas and Maggie Harris."]}, {"page": "List of Guyanese writers", "response": ["* Sharon Maas (b. 1951)"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Sharon Maas (b. 1951, Guyana/England), nv."]}]}}
