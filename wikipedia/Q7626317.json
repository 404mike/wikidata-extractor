His debut for Weymouth was in the 3\u20130 home win during a pre-season friendly against League Two side Bournemouth on 17 July. He made his competitive debut for his new club on 15 September in the 3\u20131 away win at Droylsden, replacing Conal Platt as a substitute in the 65th minute. Doe's first start for Weymouth was against Torquay United on 25 September, in their 3\u20132 away defeat. His first goal for the club was scored on 26 January 2008, away at Rushden & Diamonds, as Weymouth were defeated 3\u20132. Paolo Vernazza took a free kick in the 25th minute after Stuart Beavon was fouled just outside the penalty area by Curtis Osano. Doe scored with a header, which took a slight deflection as the ball crossed the goal line. During Weymouth's 2\u20131 away defeat on 1 March to Halifax Town, Doe was controversially sent off three minutes into stoppage time. He was sent off for a tackle on Andy Campbell, but manager John Hollins claimed \"there is no doubt that Scott got the ball\". Weymouth finished the season in 18th position, defying relegation, with Doe ending the 2007\u201308 season having made 33 appearances in the Conference, scoring once. Doe won the \"Supporters Player of The Year\" award, describing it as \"the best thing in the World\". He admitted he did not expect to play more than 15 games during the season, saying \"when I first came to the club I thought I might play 15 games throughout the whole season but I have ended up playing over twice that and it has just been fantastic\" stated Doe.", "Along with Anton Robinson, Marcus Browning and Stuart Beavon, Doe signed a new contract with Weymouth in May 2008. His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008\u201309 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1\u20131 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying \"I do not see it as a big deal. It's not like the club has said to me we are putting you on the transfer list because we do not want you anymore\", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to \"pay a bit of money\". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3\u20132 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; \"moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is not what I want to do\". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3\u20130 home defeat."]}, {"page": "George Moncur", "response": ["On the back of his four goals in four games during September, Moncur, alongside Colchester teammate Jamie Jones, were shortlisted for the PFA Fans Player of the Month award for League One.
