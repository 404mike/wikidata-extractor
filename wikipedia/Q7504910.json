He remained a lieutenant, serving in various ships, until 1797 when he was embroiled in a mutiny aboard . The problems arose against the backdrop of the Spithead Mutiny in Britain, when malcontents in the Mediterranean Fleet, at this time stationed off Cadiz, were seized at the orders of Earl St Vincent. These men were sentenced to death by court martial on Saturday and due to be executed on the Sunday morning. St George was chosen as the vessel on which the sentences would be carried out. The crew were strongly opposed to carrying out these executions on a Sunday and brought a petition to Captain Shuldham Peard, who passed it on to St Vincent. The admiral's reply was that the sentences were justified and must be carried out with alacrity. Infuriated, sections of the crew prepared to seize the ship and gathered on deck, where they were met by Peard and Hatley, the ship's second in command. Addressing his men, Peard attempted to calm them but without effect. Seeking to prevent a mutiny and ensuing massacre, Peard and Hatley then charged the mass of sailors and seized two ringleaders. The next day the scheduled executions were carried out and a week later the two men captured by Peard and Hatley were similarly hanged. For his services on this occasion, Hatley was promoted to commander.James, Vol. 2, p. 62"]}, {"page": "John Whitehead Peard", "response": ["John Whitehead Peard (1811\u20131880) was a British soldier, renowned as 'Garibaldi's Englishman'.Peard at wdl.org He was the second son of Vice-Admiral Shuldham Peard.

On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate HMS Success, which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain Shuldham Peard reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta.Bradford, p. 245 These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perr\u00e9e in G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, one of the ships of the line that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier.Clowes, p. 419 On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on Alexander.

After passing southwards together, the united squadron reached the Straits of Gibraltar on 9 February and passed through them without resistance.Woodman, p. 158 As most of the British fleet was operating in the Mediterranean Sea and no news of Ganteaume's operation had yet reached the authorities at Gibraltar, the only Royal Navy ship on hand to observe the French squadron was the 32-gun frigate HMS Success under Captain Shuldham Peard that lay at anchor off the British base.Clowes, p. 448 Peard correctly assumed that the French squadron was sailing for Egypt and decided to follow them, shadowing the French during 10 February. That day the French captured and scuttled the 10-gun cutter . In the evening, Ganteaume called his ships to a halt off Cape de Gata in the Alboran Sea and Peard unwittingly passed them in the night, so that by the morning of 11 February the French were in a position to pursue his frigate.James, p. 90"]}, {"page": "Order of battle in the Algeciras campaign", "response": ["| align= left |Captain Shuldham Peard", "| align= left |Captain Shuldham Peard"]}, {"page": "First Battle of Algeciras", "response": ["Delayed during 5 July by contrary winds, Saumarez's squadron did not reach Algeciras until 07:00 on 6 July, the British admiral deciding to immediately descend on the French squadron and issuing orders for his ships to launch their small boats \"in readiness to act when required\".Clowes, p. 461 Thousands of spectators lined both the Spanish and Gibraltan shoreline in anticipation of the battle to come.Mostert, p. 407 Orders had been given for HMS Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood to lead the attack as the officer with most experience in these waters, and his vessel was the first to enter the bay around Cabrita Point. Once in the bay however, the wind dropped and Hood was left becalmed. As a result, the first shots of the engagement were fired from a battery on Cabrita Point at HMS Pompee under Captain Charles Stirling, which entered the bay at 07:50, followed closely by HMS Audacious under Captain Shuldham Peard. On sighting the British squadron, Linois gave orders for the French ships to warp into the shallower waters along the shoreline, and many sailors and soldiers aboard were despatched to assist the Spanish gun batteries around the bay.Mostert, p. 404 The French ships joined the fire as Pompee and Audacious came within range, first Muiron and then the ships of the line attacking the approaching British vessels.Musteen, p. 35"]}, {"page": "HMS Success (1781)", "response": ["In May 1799 Captain Shuldham Peard took command of Success, and was sent to serve in the Mediterranean. On 9 June of that year, Success was off Cap de Creus, when Peard spotted a polacca to the north-west. He gave chase, but the vessel took refuge in the harbour of El Port de la Selva, so he sent in his boats to cut her out. After a fierce action, in which Success suffered three killed and nine badly wounded, she proved to be the Bella Aurora, sailing from Genoa to Barcelona with a cargo of cotton, silk and rice, and armed with 10 guns, all 9- or 6-pounders. In his report Peard pointed out that the attack had been carried out in broad daylight by only 43 men against a vessel crewed by 113, protected by boarding netting, and supported from the shore by a small gun battery and a large number of men with muskets. Subsequently, in 1847, a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal marked \"9 June 1799\" awarded to any surviving members of the action who applied for it. Shortly after, Success was one of the fleet, part of which fought the action of 18 June 1799, in which three French frigates and two brigs were captured."]}, {"page": "Order of battle in the Croisi\u00e8re de Bruix", "response": ["| align= left | Captain Shuldham Peard"]}, {"page": "Peard", "response": ["*John Whitehead Peard (1811-1880), British soldier, the son of Shuldham Peard", "*Shuldham Peard (1761\u20131832), British admiral, father of John Whitehead Peard"]}, {"page": "Croisi\u00e8re de Bruix", "response": ["Bruix was not sailing to Ireland.

Her grandfather was Shuldham Peard and her uncle was John Whitehead Peard. Her older brother George Shuldham Peard (1829\u20131918) was a veteran of the Crimean War and likewise an author. With so many distinguished soldiers and sailors in her family it is not surprising that military themes and battles frequently appear in her stories. It appears that she was widely travelled, perhaps venturing as far as India, but in later life she lived in Torquay, Devon, with her mother.John Sutherland, The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction, Routledge (Second edition, 2009), p. 501."]}]}}
