In 1990 Spice Engineering adapted its existing Group C design to take a 3.5L DFZ instead of the previously used 3.3-L DFL engine. However the new engine caused significant problems due to vibration, which resulted in the breakage of components and a significant increase in running costs - Gordon Spice estimated that the DFZ-powered car was about four times more expensive to run than the DFL-engined one.  The DFZ was successfully used in FIA Cup class racing in 1992, with that low-powered class being the last appearance of the DFV family in sportscar racing."]}, {"page": "Larry Perkins", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Gordon Spice  John Rulon-Miller"]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7ois Migault", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Gordon Spice", "|align=\"left\"|  Gordon Spice Xavier Lapeyre"]}, {"page": "Spa 24 Hours", "response": ["| Gordon Spice Teddy Pilette"]}, {"page": "Spice (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Gordon Spice (born 1940), a British former racing driver"]}, {"page": "Carlo Facetti", "response": ["The Alba AR6 continued to use Facetti's engine for the 1985 season, the team lost reliability with it, trying to keep up with pace-setter Gordon Spice, Finotto turned his attention to the IMSA Camel Lights category in America for 1986.
