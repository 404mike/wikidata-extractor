The couple would collaborate on several works, including an English translation of Robert Hertz's Death and the Right Hand.His fieldwork was with the Penan of Borneo (1951-2) and the Siwang of Malaysia (1953-5). His doctoral thesis on the Penan was accepted in 1953. He was University Lecturer in Social Anthropology, Oxford University, 1956\u201376; Professor of Social Anthropology, Oxford, 1976\u201390; Official Fellow, Merton College, Oxford, 1971\u201375; and Fellow, All Souls College, Oxford, 1976-90.Together with Edmund Leach and Mary Douglas, Needham brought structuralism from France and anglicised it in the process. A prolific scholar, he was also a teacher and a rediscoverer of neglected figures in the history of his discipline, such as Arnold Van Gennep and Robert Hertz.\nAmong other things, he contributed to the study of family resemblance, introducing the terms \"monothetic\" and \"polythetic\" into anthropology.\nHe had two children, one of whom, Tristan, became a professor of mathematics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cultural anthropology", "response": ["Economic anthropology as influenced by Karl Polanyi and practiced by Marshall Sahlins and George Dalton challenged standard neoclassical economics to take account of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as Max Gluckman and Peter Worsley experimented with Marxism and authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach incorporated L\u00e9vi-Strauss's structuralism into their work. Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in the 1960s and 1970s, including cognitive anthropology and componential analysis."]}, {"page": "Structuralism", "response": ["In Britain, authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach were highly influenced by structuralism. Authors such as Maurice Godelier and Emmanuel Terray combined Marxism with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as Marshall Sahlins and James Boon built on structuralism to provide their own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as Eric Wolf argued that political economy and colonialism should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by Pierre Bourdieu led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which Sherry Ortner has referred to as 'practice theory'."]}, {"page": "Incest taboo", "response": ["* Rodney Needham, Structure and Sentiment: A Test Case in Social Anthropology"]}, {"page": "Totem", "response": ["As a chief representative of modern structuralism, French ethnologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and his  (\"Totemism Today\" [1958])(L\u00e9vi-Strauss C., Le Tot\u00e9misme aujourd'hui(1958); english  trans.  as  Totemism, by Rodney Needham.

Hocart's broad training and willingness to explore a wide variety of approaches produced work that was often poorly received by colleagues who repudiated past work in order to legitimize anthropology as a hard science. Interest in his work was revived in the 1960s when authors such as Lord Raglan, Rodney Needham, and Louis Dumont returned to Hocart's work as a source of theoretical inspiration.

Sperber, however, soon developed a more critical attitude to structuralism and objected to the use interpretive ethnographic data as if it were an objective record, and for its lack of explanatory power.
