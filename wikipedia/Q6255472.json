He was fascinated by the history of the area, and was an avid researcher of and writer on local history. Apart from numerous articles, he wrote two significant books on the area's history (see below). According to John Roland Bibby in the foreword to a facsimile version of the latter of these books, David edited the local parish magazine and contributed to The Newcastle Society of Antiquities with his writings and artefacts that he had been given. He was a Church Warden, a Sunday School teacher, co-founder of the Rothbury Company of Volunteers, a member of the local Red Cross Society, a guide for visitors to Coquetdale, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.", "Both books are significant histories of the area, and original copies are rare and sought after. As a result, Frank Graham publishers produced facsimile copies in the 1970s. The first was Upper Coquetdale in 1974, with a foreword by John Roland Bibby, and the facsimile copy of Whittingham Vale was published in 1979. In more recent years, a number of reprints have become available and both remain fascinating and detailed accounts of the history of the area."]}, {"page": "List of Geordie songwriters", "response": ["|John Roland Bibby"]}, {"page": "John Bibby", "response": ["*John Roland Bibby (1917\u20131997), Northumbrian-born scholar, poet, writer, historian and antiquarian"]}]}}
