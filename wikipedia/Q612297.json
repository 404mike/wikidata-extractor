He was the author of Outlines of Botany (1835), and Illustrations of Useful Plants employed in the Arts and Medicine, published posthumously and illustrated by his sister Mary Ann Burnett.

The 1835 publication of that name by Gilbert Thomas Burnett (Burnett) is invalid because it lacks a description (or diagnosis or reference to an earlier description or diagnosis). Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (Horan.) published the name in 1847, but Amygdaloideae, published in 1832 by George Arnott Walker-Arnott, has priority and is therefore the correct name."]}, {"page": "Scilloideae", "response": ["When treated as a subfamily, the name Scilloideae is derived from the generic name of the type genus, Scilla, and is attributed to Gilbert Thomas Burnett in 1835.

Burnett divided his circumscription of the family Gesneriaceae into \"Besleridae\" and \"Gesneridae\". The latter was distinguished by having an inferior or semi-inferior ovary and the calyx adhering to the gynoecium (\"germen\"). However, Burnett's circumscription of the family and subfamilies was very different to the modern conception. He placed the \"Didymocarpidae\" (a name which corresponds to the modern Didymocarpoideae), not in Gesneriaceae, but in Acanthaceae. Since about 1997, phylogenetic studies, mostly based on molecular approaches, have resulted in major changes to the traditional taxonomy and classification of the family Gesneriaceae, at every level from genus upwards."]}, {"page": "Mary Ann Burnett", "response": ["Burnett was the illustrator and editor of Illustrations of Useful Plants employed in the Arts and Medicine (1839-40).
