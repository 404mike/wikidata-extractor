After making 26 appearances in all competitions, he left for Huddersfield Town. Cox helped Mick Buxton's side gain promotion to the Football League Second Division, though by the time he left after 213 league games they had returned to the Third, but he may be best remembered for a game against Manchester City in 1987 when three players, Paul Stewart, David White and Tony Adcock, all scored hat-tricks as Huddersfield lost 10\u20131. He went on to play for Mansfield Town and Hartlepool United, where he was part of the team that won promotion from the Fourth Division in the 1990\u201391 season. He later played for Buxton.\nBrian Cox has since run betting shops and worked for an offshoot of the National Health Service.
