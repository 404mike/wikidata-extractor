Among his works are singles \"Offshore\", an Ibiza trance anthem included in many compilations in both chill-out and dance versions; \"Saltwater\", which featured vocals by Clannad member M\u00e1ire Brennan, and the UK number-one hit \"Don't Give Up\", featuring vocals by Bryan Adams, which also became a top ten hit on singles charts across Europe and Australia.\nFar from the Maddening Crowds, Chicane's debut studio album from 1997, is still considered a seminal release among the trance music community, and his second studio album, 2000's Behind the Sun, was certified gold in the UK. In 2007, after the hindrance of an ultimately unreleased album (Easy to Assemble) in the intervening time, the third artist album Somersault was released on Bracegirdle's independent record label, followed shortly after by a tenth anniversary re-release of Far from the Maddening Crowds which included a new mix of \"Offshore\" (\"Offshore 2007\"). He released his fourth studio album Giants in 2010, with the fifth studio album Thousand Mile Stare following less than two years later, in spring 2012. The sixth studio album, The Sum of Its Parts, appeared in early 2015, and his seventh studio album, The Place You Can't Remember, the Place You Can't Forget, was released in 2018. The eighth studio album, Everything We Had to Leave Behind, was released in 2021.\nIn addition, Bracegirdle also worked with Leo Elstob under the alias Disco Citizens, producing a handful of less radio-friendly, vocal-less tracks with a stronger progressive house sound. Working with singer Vanessa St. James and producer Mr. Joshua, Bracegirdle was part of the Mr. Joshua Presents Espiritu project, known for the song \"In Praise of the Sun\", released with both English and French vocals. Bracegirdle contributed with executive production on Tomski's \"14 Hours to Save the Earth\".
