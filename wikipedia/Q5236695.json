At the same time he also recognised that if he could exert influence and pressure on the BBC, the Corporation could become a useful tool to serve Plaid Cymru's political ends. In 1929 he declared it would soon be necessary to arrange for \"thousands of Welshmen to be prosecuted for refusing to pay for English programmes\".Manchester Guardian 1 August 1929 The following year Lewis was commissioned by E.R. Appleton, Director of the BBC's Cardiff radio station, (who had banned broadcasting in Welsh) to broadcast a talk which would \"explain Welsh Nationalism\". On vetting the script, which advocated political nationalism in preference to \"cultural nationalism\", Appleton decided it was too controversial and inflammatory to be broadcast. In October 1933 the University of Wales Council, which had been lobbying for more Welsh-language broadcasting, appointed a ten-man council to press the case with the BBC. It included David Lloyd George, William George, W.\u00a0J. Gruffydd and Saunders Lewis \u2013 who was continuing to incense the BBC by publicly alleging it was \"seeking the destruction of the Welsh language\". The University Committee, which was described by BBC Director General John Reith as \"the most unpleasant and unreliable people with whom it has been my misfortune to deal\" gained ever more influence on the BBC in Wales not least in the selection of BBC staff \u2013 a function delegated to the Committee by the Corporation. As newspapers of the time noted, appointees seemed primarily drawn from the families of the Welsh-speaking elite including \"the son of a professor of Welsh and the offspring of three archdruids\". Saunders Lewis's assiduous campaigning over the years was to succeed in cementing an ongoing Plaid Cymru influence within the BBC. When the BBC's Welsh Advisory Council was eventually established in 1946, although half its members were Labour, several Plaid Cymru supporters were appointed including Saunders Lewis's successor as Plaid Cymru president, Gwynfor Evans."]}, {"page": "Tywyn", "response": ["After the First World War money was raised to build both the Tywyn Cottage Hospital (opened in 1922) and the Tywyn Institute (opened by David Lloyd George in 1926).
