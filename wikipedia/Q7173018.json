In later life Brush was also known by the nickname \"Basil\", as a joke based on the television puppet Basil Brush.Brush was born in Fermoy, County Cork, the son of Major George Howard Brush and May Florence Farrell.  Educated at Clifton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Brush spent his early teenage years at his father's citrus plantation in Canada, later returning to Drumnabreeze House, Magheralin, County Down.  He had a distinguished career in the British Army and during the Second World War he was wounded in France in 1940 before being held as a prisoner of war for three years. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions during the defence of Calais in 1940. By the time he retired from the army he had reached the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Settling in County Down he took up farming but remained involved in military activity with the Territorial Army. He also served as deputy Lord Lieutenant of Down until resigning from the position in 1974.Brush first received public attention in 1973 when stories appeared in the press that he had been drilling his own right-wing loyalist private militia force. Claiming 5,000 members, the group, known as Down Orange Welfare, became involved in the Ulster Workers' Council strike of 1974, with Brush taking a leading role in planning the stoppage as a member of the Ulster Workers' Council's Co-ordinating Committee.\nBrush was also president of the South Down Ulster Unionist Party Association and represented the constituency in the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention. He left the public eye after a second less successful loyalist strike in 1977.In 1935 he married Susan Mary Torbett; they had one daughter, Maureen Rosemary Brush, who was born in 1940.  He died, aged 83, in Dublin.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Magheralin", "response": ["* Lt Col Peter Brush"]}, {"page": "United Ulster Unionist Council", "response": ["| Peter Brush || Down Orange Welfare"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention", "response": ["|Peter Brush", "|Peter Brush"]}, {"page": "South Down (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| Peter Brush(UUP)"]}, {"page": "Down Orange Welfare", "response": ["The group was established in 1972 by its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Brush and his deputy Herbert Heslip, both members of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP).Abstracts on Organisations - 'D' Claiming to be linked to the Orange Order, the group was said to have 5,000 trained activists, many of whom were serving members of the security forces and former members of the Ulster Special Constabulary, commonly referred to as the \"B Specials\".
