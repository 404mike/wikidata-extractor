He made his debut in a Second Division match against Leicester Fosse on 2 September 1899 and immediately became a first-team regular at left back; he played 30 out of 34 league matches in 1899\u20131900, which included appearing in Arsenal's 12\u20130 defeat of Loughborough on 12 March 1900.\nHe continued to feature regularly for the next two seasons, missing just five matches over the course of both 1900\u201301 and 1901\u201302. He eventually switched over to right back so Arsenal could accommodate Jimmy Jackson at left back; however the emergence of Archie Cross and a period of injury meant McNicol lost his place in 1902\u201303 and he eventually left Arsenal in October 1903. In total he played 112 matches, scoring one goal. He moved to Aberdeen and spent two seasons there as team captain before retiring prematurely in 1905 due to injury.His elder brother John McNicol was also a footballer.", "link_mentions": []}}
