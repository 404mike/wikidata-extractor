He has been identified with a Richard son of Siward of Farnham in Lower Nithsdale in Yorkshire who around 1215 was pardoned a homicide on his release into the service of a magnate during the war of the barons against King John.  The reason for this is because a Richard son of Siward can be found in the service of William de Forz count of Aumale, a leading Yorkshire baron, in King John's reign.  He was the same Richard as the subject of this article and went on to serve the counts of Aumale till 1221 and the earls of Pembroke till 1231 as a leading household knight.  His obscure origins have attracted legends amongst later genealogists.  One suggests that he was descended from Syward, the Saxon Earl of Northumberland.  The 16th-century Glamorganshire antiquary, Rice Merrick, theorised Richard was one of the legendary Twelve Knights whom Robert fitz Hamo settled in Glamorgan after its Conquest, though since that happened before 1100 it is not a serious possibility.Rice Merrick, Morganiae Archaiographia, ed.
