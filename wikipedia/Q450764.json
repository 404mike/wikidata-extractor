Burgin first came to attention as a conceptual artist in the late 1960s (Harrison & Wood, 1992; Walker, 2001) and at that time was most noted for being a political photographer of the left, who would fuse photographs and words in the same picture.  He has worked with photography and film, calling painting \"the anachronistic daubing of woven fabrics with coloured mud\" (Burgin, 1976). His work is influenced by a variety of theorists and philosophers, most especially thinkers such as Sigmund Freud, Henri Lefebvre, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes.
