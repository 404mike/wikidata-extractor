When formulating homology he adapted idealist philosophy to reconcile natural theology with development, unifying nature as divergence from an underlying form in a process demonstrating design. His conclusion to his On the Nature of Limbs of 1849 suggested that divine laws could have controlled the development of life, but he did not expand this idea after objections from his conservative patrons. Others supported the idea of development by law, including the botanist Hewett Watson (1804-1881) and the Reverend Baden Powell (1796-1860), who wrote in 1855 that such laws better illustrated the powers of the Creator. In 1858 Owen in his speech as President of the British Association said that in \"continuous operation of Creative power\" through geological time, new species of animals appeared in a \"successive and continuous fashion\" through birth from their antecedents by a Creative law rather than through slow transmutation."]}, {"page": "1804 in science", "response": ["* May 9 \u2013 Hewett Watson, English biologist (died 1881)"]}, {"page": "Thames Ditton", "response": ["* Hewett Watson 9 May 1804, and died at Thames Ditton, Surrey, on 27 July 1881", "* Hewett Watson - phrenologist, friend of Charles Darwin, evolutionary botanist"]}, {"page": "Reactions to On the Origin of Species", "response": ["The most enthusiastic response came from atheists, with Hewett Watson hailing Darwin as the \"greatest revolutionist in natural history of this century\".
