In five years, he made 74 league appearances and scored sixteen goals for the club.\nIn July 1962, he moved south of the border to join Ron Suart's Blackpool. He made his debut for the club on 1 September 1962, in a 1\u20131 draw at Aston Villa. He made 36 further appearances in the 1962\u201363 season, scoring six goals.\nIn 1963\u201364, he made 30 league appearances and scored five goals (including one in a 2\u20131 victory over Liverpool at Anfield on 31 August 1963).\nAfter missing the first sixteen games of the 1964\u201365 campaign, McPhee played in the remaining 26, scoring one goal. At the end of the season, he was voted the club's Player of the Year. He won the accolade again three years later.\nDuring 1965\u201366, McPhee became Blackpool's first participating substitute when he replaced John Craven after 83 minutes in a 3\u20130 victory over Leicester City on 14 September. Up until that point, Blackpool had played 713 minutes of the season without using a substitute.In 1967\u201368, Blackpool were playing Second Division football after suffering relegation the previous campaign. Stan Mortensen was in his first full season in charge after succeeding Ron Suart, and under his managership McPhee was an ever-present in Blackpool's 47 league and cup games.\nHe made 38 league appearances the following season, 1968\u201369, and scored one goal.\nUnder new manager Les Shannon in 1969\u201370, McPhee made 29 league appearances in his final season with the club. His last appearance occurred in the final game of the season, a 2\u20130 league defeat at Oxford United. It didn't matter, however, since Blackpool had sealed promotion back to Division One the previous week.\nAfter over 250 league games for the Tangerines, McPhee was sold to Barnsley at the end of the season. He spent one term at Oakwell before joining Southport in 1971, with whom he finished his career.\nJohn Mcphee granddaughter is pop star Suzi Wu", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McPhee", "response": ["*John McPhee (born 1931), American writer, pioneer of creative nonfiction", "*John McPhee (footballer) (born 1937), Scottish former professional footballer", "*John McPhee (motorcycle racer) (born 1994), British Grand Prix motorcycle racer", "*John McPhee (politician), KCMG (1878\u20131952), Australian politician, member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly"]}, {"page": "History of Blackpool F.C.
