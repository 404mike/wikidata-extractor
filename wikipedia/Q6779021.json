He supported Cambridge's two new women's colleges, Newnham and Girton, and taught informal weekly classes at Newnham.

Neilson continued to publish other major works, including Peel: its Meaning and Derivation in 1894, and in 1899 he published the Annals of the Solway. Outwith his traditional areas of medieval Scottish history Neilson also maintained an interest in Romano-British archaeology, a subject which he first explored in his Per lineam valli, published in 1891. This particular publication has been credited for developing new approaches to the study of Hadrian's Wall. Neilson was also responsible for editing a 'pioneering study' of the Antonine Wall, the Antonine Wall Report, for the Glasgow Archaeological Society in 1899."]}]}}
