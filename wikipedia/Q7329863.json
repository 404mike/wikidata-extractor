He is Emeritus Churchill Professor of Mathematics for Operational Research in the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge. \nWeber was educated at Walnut Hills High School, Solihull School and Downing College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1974,\nand completed his PhD in 1980 under the supervision of Peter Nash. He has been on the faculty of the University of Cambridge since 1978, and a fellow of Queens' College since 1977  where he has been Vice President from 1996\u20132007 and again from 2018\u20132020. He was appointed Churchill Professor in 1994, and he became\nEmeritus Churchill Professor on retirement in 2017. He was Director of the Statistical Laboratory from 1999 to 2009, and is a trustee of the Rollo Davidson Trust.He works on the mathematics of large complex systems subject to uncertainty. He has made contributions to stochastic scheduling, Markov decision processes, queueing theory, the probabilistic analysis of algorithms, the theory of communications pricing and control, and rendezvous search.\nWeber and his co-authors were awarded the 2007 INFORMS prize for their paper on the online bin packing algorithm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rendezvous problem", "response": ["Examples of this class of problems are known as rendezvous problems.  These problems were first introduced informally by Steve Alpern in 1976,. and he formalised the continuous version of the problem in 1995. This has led to much recent research in rendezvous search.. Even the symmetric rendezvous problem played in n discrete locations (sometimes called the Mozart Cafe Rendezvous Problem). has turned out to be very difficult to solve, and in 1990 Richard Weber and Eddie Anderson conjectured the optimal strategy.. Only recently has the conjecture been proved for n = 3 by Richard Weber.. This was the first non-trivial symmetric rendezvous search problem to be fully solved. Note that the corresponding asymmetric rendezvous problem has a simple optimal solution: one player stays put and the other player visits a random permutation of the locations.
