He studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, London, was superintendent of the Brown Institute for Animals (a pathology research centre), and was a professor of bacteriology at the University of London. He researched into Johne's disease, a chronic intestinal infection of cattle, and also discovered that vitamin K is needed by growing leprosy bacteria.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bacteriophage", "response": ["In 1896, Ernest Hanbury Hankin reported that something in the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India had a marked antibacterial action against cholera and it could pass through a very fine porcelain filter.

George and Gladys Dick showed that cell-free filtrates could induce the erythematous reaction characteristic of scarlet fever, proving that this reaction was due to a toxin. Karelitz and Stempien discovered that extracts from human serum globulin and placental globulin can be used as lightening agents for scarlet fever and this was used later as the basis for the Dick test.

D'H\u00e9relle said that the phages always appeared in the stools of Shigella dysentery patients shortly before they began to recover. He \"quickly learned that bacteriophages are found wherever bacteria thrive: in sewers, in rivers that catch waste runoff from pipes, and in the stools of convalescent patients\". Phage therapy was immediately recognized by many to be a key way forward for the eradication of pathogenic bacterial infections. A Georgian, George Eliava, was making similar discoveries. He travelled to the Pasteur Institute in Paris where he met d'H\u00e9relle, and in 1923 he founded the Eliava Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia, devoted to the development of phage therapy. Phage therapy is used in Russia, Georgia and Poland, and was used prophylactically for a time in the Soviet army."]}, {"page": "Escherichia virus T4", "response": ["Bacteriophages were first discovered by the English scientist Frederick Twort in 1915 and F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle in 1917.

These two researchers isolated T3, T4, T5, and T6 from E.coli. Also, in 1932, the researcher J. Bronfenbrenner had studied and worked on the T2 phage, at which the T2 phage was isolated from the virus. This isolation was made from a fecal material rather than from sewerage.

He called it a \"contagious living fluid\" ()\u2014or a \"soluble living germ\" because he could not find any germ-like particles. In the early 20th century, English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered viruses that infect bacteria, and French-Canadian microbiologist F\u00e9lix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on agar, would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria.

They were discovered in the early 20th century, by the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort (1877\u20131950). But before this time, in 1896, the bacteriologist Ernest Hanbury Hankin (1865\u20131939) reported that something in the waters of the River Ganges could kill Vibrio cholerae \u2013 the cause of cholera. The agent in the water could be passed through filters that remove bacteria but was destroyed by boiling. Twort discovered the action of bacteriophages on staphylococci bacteria. He noticed that when grown on nutrient agar some colonies of the bacteria became watery or \"glassy\". He collected some of these watery colonies and passed them through a Chamberland filter to remove the bacteria and discovered that when the filtrate was added to fresh cultures of bacteria, they in turn became watery. He proposed that the agent might be \"an amoeba, an ultramicroscopic virus, a living protoplasm, or an enzyme with the power of growth\"."]}, {"page": "Virus", "response": ["In the early 20th century, the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered a group of viruses that infect bacteria, now called bacteriophagesShors p. 827 (or commonly 'phages'), and the French-Canadian microbiologist F\u00e9lix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten with the development of penicillin. The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has renewed interest in the therapeutic use of bacteriophages."]}, {"page": "Twort", "response": ["*Frederick Twort (1877\u20131950), English bacteriologist"]}, {"page": "Frederick William Twort", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Twort"]}, {"page": "Twortvirus", "response": ["Twortvirus is named as after the British bacteriological Frederick Twort."]}, {"page": "Duplodnaviria", "response": ["Tailed bacteriophages were discovered independently by Frederick Twort in 1915 and F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle in 1917, and they have been the focus of much research since then.
