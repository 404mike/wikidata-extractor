Before moving to Brooklyn in 2010, she met with a representative from Epic Records at a SXSW event and was eventually signed to the label in 2009. She began working on the album, collaborating with musicians like Jimmy Harry, Dan Carey, and Lester Mendez. A digital extended play titled Oh Land EP was released in October 2010, featuring five songs that would later appear on the parent album.", "According to Andrew Leahey of AllMusic, Oh Land is a combination of \"club, dance, and nocturnal electro-pop\". The album opens with \"Perfection\", which was co-written and produced by Dan Carey. It features \"dreamy violin-laden confessions\" and was called a \"take on Misery-era Blonde Redhead\" by Drowned in Sounds John Calvert. \"Break the Chain\" references the singer's back injury following a dancing accident, where she refuses doctor's orders by continuing to pursue her dreams; it contains dubstep and flamenco \"undertones\" in addition to shackle sound effects. \"Sun of a Gun\" uses a metaphor regarding the orbit of the sun to describe being in love with someone who is \"destructive\" and \"dangerous\". The song's Europop sound was compared to the works of Kylie Minogue and Goldfrapp. The fourth track and third single, \"Voodoo\", is a synth-pop track that has Oh Land performing a \"spoken word verse over disco beats\". BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine wrote that the track's style was similar to the work of Marina and the Diamonds. He also compared the album's fifth track, \"Lean\", to Massive Attack's \"Teardrop\" (1998). \"Lean\" and \"Wolf & I\" are trip hop tracks, with the latter being described as dramatic by Gaffas Michael Jose Gonzalez.", "In a mixed review, Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani expressed that Oh Land's \"cinematic arrangements bring Janelle Mon\u00e1e's ambitious approach to pop music to mind, but tracks like 'Wolf & I' and 'Lean' draw a bit too heavily from the trip-hop playbook [...] and, however well-excecuted they may be, end up sounding derivative.\" Similarly, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music felt that \"there's a bit of an identity void at the heart of the thing, a lack of personality. It might just be that Oh Land is more skilled at getting songs to sound current than she is at expressing herself.\" Drowned in Sounds John Calvert called the album \"hip, diverse and always vibrant\", but also branded it \"pretty forgettable\". Calvert pointed out the production work of Dave McCracken and Dan Carey, noting the album \"inhabits a tepid middle ground between the two extremes\u2014offering neither gilded Scandi chart-pop (Robyn, Annie) or the artistic mettle of Scandi indie bands, most of whom are able to turn out sublime pop anyway.\"", "* Dan Carey \u2013 engineering, production ; mixing ; string arrangements ; instrumentation ", "Category:Albums produced by Dan Carey (record producer)"]}, {"page": "Colour of the Trap", "response": ["* Dan Carey \u2013 bass, keyboards", "* Dan Carey \u2013 production (1-5, 7, 10-12)", "Category:Albums produced by Dan Carey (record producer)"]}, {"page": "Toy (English band)", "response": ["2014 the band toured Europe in a nine-week trip including a lot of places outside the usual tour scheme like Ljubljana and Bratislava.
