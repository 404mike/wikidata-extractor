However, in 1929, his new wife gave birth to a daughter, Anne, who lifted his spirits a great deal. Anne Dunn grew up to be an artist, studying under Henry Moore and in Paris, France with Fernand L\u00e9ger and at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. Nevertheless, Dunn and his second wife divorced in 1942 following which he married his long-time personal secretary, Marcia Anastasia Christoforides.

Lady Beaverbrook was considered an eccentric character who gave most of her horses names consisting of one word with seven letters (Bustino, Terimon, Boldboy, Niniski, Mystiko, Petoski), as this was the most common form for Derby winners. Relkino was sent into training with Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Relkino was a very headstrong animal with a tendency to bolt: Willie Carson, who rode the horse in some of his major victories admitted that \"I couldn't hold one side of him the first time I rode him work\"."]}]}}
