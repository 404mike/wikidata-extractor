Things do not get much better, when she is made to wear some dirty, second-hand clothes to a sports lesson. Mini McGuinness (Freya Mavor), the queen bee of the school, immediately takes issue with Franky's androgynous dress sense, due to her obsession with fashion. The two then get into a fight on the sports field. At lunch, she is approached by Alo Creevey (Will Merrick) and Rich Hardbeck (Alex Arnold), two fellow outcasts, who hope to make friends. The two are chased off by Mini and her friends, Liv Malone (Laya Lewis) and Grace Blood (Jessica Sula), and is invited to hang out later. Though she refuses at first, she eventually agrees. The three take some Miaow-Miaow and have fun at the local shopping centre. They return home to meet Franky's two dads, Geoff and Jeff (Gareth Farr and John Sessions). There, they discover via some pictures on \"Friendlook\" that Franky was victimised mercilessly in Oxford. The very next day, after Frank with Mini and calls her a \"bulimic Barbie,\" Mini has her boyfriend, Nick Levan (Sean Teale), post the pictures she found on the walls of the school, causing Franky to run off, crying. She goes to a rubbish dump to smoke a joint and take out her frustration by shooting an old fridge. There, she is approached by Matty (Sebastian De Souza), Nick's older brother, who tells her she is beautiful. She then discovers Grace, who had taken an interest in her from the beginning, in her room. Empowered by these two encounters, she confronts Mini at a party, and appeals to Grace and Liv that they truly like her. When they do not verbally respond, she leaves in frustration.

The video was directed by British music video director Dawn Shadforth. Former Skins star Laya Lewis features in the clip alongside Sand\u00e9. In the video, Sand\u00e9 enters a hospital to visit a childhood friend who appears to be suffering severely with cancer and is close to death. When she finds her friend, who appears to be extremely depressed, she gives her a pink wig to wear as the cancer has taken her hair. After helping her to get dressed Sand\u00e9 takes her from the hospital, unbeknownst to the doctors, to take her to the seafront amusements in Hastings to make the last of her days the best she's ever had. Sand\u00e9 also takes her to a park, intercut with scenes of them there when they were young. The video ends with Sand\u00e9 and her friend sitting on a hill above the seaside town and her sitting a hospital corridor, seemingly having taken her friend back. An alternative interpretation is that Sand\u00e9 and the woman being hospitalized are in a same-gender relationship, as hinted by the photograph taken of both of them as adults, as opposed to children. Sand\u00e9 goes to a hospital to comfort her partner with a pink wig, a car ride, and then a merry-go-round ride."]}]}}
