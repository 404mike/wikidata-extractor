It consists of four cantos, the first of which introduces the subject and covers the management of hounds. The second canto deals with hare hunting and the third with fox hunting, while the fourth covers otter hunting and the breeding and care of hounds. The poem passed through many editions, some of the later including the two poems on country pursuits that followed it.

The first of these in Cranford's case was issued by Smith, Elder & Co in 1864 with illustrations by George du Maurier, whose approach was to interpret scenes in contemporary terms. There was a change of emphasis in Hugh Thomson's 1891 illustrations, where the Cranford interiors and styles of dress are pictured as closer to the preindustrial Regency period of Elizabeth Gaskell's memories. There was also an emotional shift from Du Maurier's psychological but compassionate depiction of people in limited circumstances to a greater emphasis on humour and sentimentality, a change of approach which was to prove influential on other illustrators for decades to come.Simon Cooke, \"From George du Maurier to Hugh Thomson: Illustrating the Work of Elizabeth Gaskell\", Victorian Web"]}, {"page": "1920 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 May \u2013 Hugh Thomson, illustrator (born 1860)"]}, {"page": "1860 in art", "response": ["* June 1 \u2013 Hugh Thomson, Irish-born illustrator (died 1920)"]}, {"page": "1920 in art", "response": ["* May 7 \u2013 Hugh Thomson, British illustrator (b. 1860)"]}, {"page": "C.

It was named for the 1891 Macmillian reissue of Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell's Cranford by Hugh Thomson. The style was a nostalgic, affectionate and slightly whimsical approach to historical themes. Thomson's illustration in the book inaugurated a Cranford School distinguished by graphic nostalgia for a philistinism that was no more. The members of the school had all been fired by the literature, art, costume or atmosphere of England in the eighteenth century and became dealers in nostalgia on a very large scale. It was a style of illustration harking back to pre-industrial rural England, which specialized in the nostalgic recreation of a by-gone golden era before the ravages of industrialization. In reality, it was only the introduction of photo-mechanical reproduction of drawings instead of wood engravings that enabled the fine pen lines distinctive of the school."]}, {"page": "Highways and Byways (series of regional guides)", "response": ["The Highways and Byways series of 36 regional guides were published between 1898 and 1948 by Macmillan's.
