He attended Mr Munro's school in Newington, but was forced aged 16 to finish his education and take up work as an apprentice bank clerk at the Bank of Scotland, where he remained for 18 years. Although he detested the work, in his spare time he educated himself about art and worked as a critic. He was particularly influenced by the art critic and writer Walter Pater, with whom he corresponded as well as reviewing some of Pater's work including Marius the Epicurean.Gray was friendly with a number of prominent artists and public figures, including artists William Bell Scott and Phoebe Anna Traquair, and physician and writer John Brown. In 1884 he was appointed first curator of the new Scottish National Portrait Gallery, initially at temporary premises and later in Robert Rowand Anderson's Queen Street building, which opened in 1889.He wrote regularly for periodicals including Academy and the Edinburgh Evening Courant and was chief art critic of the Scottish Leader. His publications included an 1880 book on Scottish artist George Manson and several essays on the iconography of Robert Burns. His two-volume Memoir and Remains was posthumously published by David Douglas in Edinburgh in 1895.\nHe died on 22 March 1894 of a brain haemorrhage, shortly before his 44th birthday, and was buried at Echo Bank cemetery in Newington, Edinburgh. He left most of his estate to the Gallery.A portrait of him by Patrick William Adam is in the collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Gray", "response": ["*John Miller Gray (1850\u20131894), Scottish art critic and curator"]}, {"page": "Scottish National Portrait Gallery", "response": ["The building was opened in 1889 under curator John Miller Gray. Over the years new facilities such as a shop and caf\u00e9 were added in a piecemeal fashion, and the galleries rearranged and remodelled, generally reducing the clarity of the layout of the building, and often the ceiling height, as well as blocking off many windows. The building was shared with the National Museum of Antiquities, which latterly became the Museum of Scotland and moved to a new building in 2009, at which point the long-planned refurbishment of the Portrait Gallery could begin, with funding from the Scottish Government and the Heritage Lottery Fund, amongst others. The work generally restores the gallery spaces to their original layout, with areas set aside for education, the shop & caf\u00e9, and a new glass lift\u2014greatly improving access for disabled visitors. In total the Portrait Gallery has 60% more gallery space after the changes, and at the reopening displayed 849 works, of which 480 were by Scots.

She was raised in Lanark and Glasgow, and in 1880 married William Rae Macdonald, an Edinburgh actuary. The Macdonalds' circle of friends in Edinburgh included art critic John Miller Gray and Phoebe Anna Traquair. Macdonald and Gray began \"searching out and enjoying old bindings in libraries,\" and this pastime led to an interest in trying the art of bookbinding for themselves. Walter Biggar Blaikie, another friend of the Macdonalds, allowed Annie Macdonald to practice in the workroom of the A. & T. Constable printing firm. There, she honed her skills and worked with the Edinburgh Social Union, of which she was a member, to institute a series of bookbinding classes led by employees of the Constable firm."]}, {"page": "Patrick Adam", "response": ["*John Miller Gray, first Curator of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery"]}]}}
