Immediately from the start, Cambridge cox Kevin Whyman steered into the Oxford water, closing the lateral gap between the boats and securing a series of warnings from race umpire Tom Cadoux-Hudson. Oxford held a lead of a few feet round the Fulham bend, but the crews were level at the mile post.  By Hammersmith Bridge, Oxford had pulled away marginally to hold a one-third length lead, but superior steering by Whyman around the Surrey bend pulled Cambridge back into contention, level by the Chiswick Steps, and a length ahead by Barnes Bridge.  Moving across, Cambridge took Oxford's clear water and passed the finishing post six seconds and two lengths ahead. It was Cambridge's fourth consecutive victory and took the overall record to 74\u201368 in their favour. By the end of the race, umpire Cadoux-Hudson had issued 132 warnings to the crews."]}, {"page": "1982 British Rowing Championships", "response": ["|Men 2+    || Tyrian / London University Richard Budgett, Tom Cadoux-Hudson, Adrian Ellison ||      ||", "|Men 4+    || Tyrian / London UniversityRichard Budgett, Tom Cadoux-Hudson, Steve King, Geraint Fuller, Adrian Ellison ||      ||"]}]}}
