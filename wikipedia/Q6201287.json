He played as an inside forward.Singer was born in Cefn Hengoed, Glamorgan. As a boy he played for Wesley Rovers Boys' Club, which fed Fleur-de-Lys Welfare, and from there he joined Newport County as an amateur in 1954. He turned professional in 1956, and went on to score 27 goals for the club at a rate better than a goal every two games, goal-poaching which earned him a move to First Division club Birmingham City. Singer spent two seasons with Birmingham, but played only 31 games in all competitions despite scoring as freely as at Newport. He played on the losing side in the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final against Roma. In September 1962, Singer signed for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic for a fee of \u00a37,000; he scored 22 goals in 59 league games before returning to Newport County in the 1964 close season.After his retirement from football, Singer kept a restaurant in Caerleon. He died in July 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Singer (surname)", "response": ["* Jimmy Singer (1937\u20132010), Welsh professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["Birmingham played Hungarians \u00dajpesti D\u00f3zsa in the first round, with the first leg to be played at home. \u00dajpest twice took the lead, equalised by a Johnny Gordon header and Gordon Astall's shot. Birmingham's repeated attacks broke down near goal, until after 83 minutes Gordon headed home an Astall corner. In the away leg, \u00dajpest took a one-goal lead after an hour, that tied the scores on aggregate, before Gordon was sent off. This left Birmingham facing \"tough opposition and downright one-sided refereeing\" without their centre-forward. But Billy Rudd scored with three minutes left, then combined with debutant Ray Barlow in a \"walking-pace attack\" for Jimmy Singer to clinch the tie with a rising shot.", "|OL||11|| Jimmy Singer"]}, {"page": "2010 in Wales", "response": ["**Jimmy Singer, footballer, 72"]}, {"page": "James Singer", "response": ["* Jimmy Singer (1937\u20132010), Welsh footballer"]}]}}
