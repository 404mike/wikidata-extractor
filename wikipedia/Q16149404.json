He then moved to Munich, where he met English drummer John Lingwood and, through him, guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton who had recently left Hawkwind.  Together they formed the band Salt, and were managed by Israeli poet and singer Samy Birnbach.  The band rehearsed together for several months in Munich, performing songs co-written by Haumer and Birnbach, before moving to London where they recorded an album of demos at Olympic Studios.  However, they could not gain a record deal as neither Haumer nor Birnbach had work permits. \"20 Undiscovered Rarities: Zakarrias\", Record Collector, 27 June 2010.
