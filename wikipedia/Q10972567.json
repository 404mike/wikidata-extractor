Two batsmen, Andy Moles and Dominic Ostler passed 1,000 runs while only Neil Smith, with 44, took more than 30 wickets. In one-day competitions they finished 10th in the National League, were knocked out of the first round of the Benson and Hedges Cup, and won the Natwest Trophy.

The stand delayed the appearance of Brian Lara, in his first Championship innings since his record-breaking innings he made a sketchy 19. Contributions down the order took the total past 400 by the time of their dismissal shortly after lunch on the second day. After the early loss of Mark Benson, Kent batted cautiously until Carl Hooper's arrival at 60/2. He batted fluently in reaching a century from 131 balls and shared 109 in 28 overs for the third wicket with David Ward (63). On the third day Richard Davis took a sharp return catch to dismiss Hooper and although Matthew Fleming struck an aggressive 73, Warwickshire were able to gain a first innings lead. The hosts openers put on a second century stand of the match, before 86 runs in 55 minutes on the fourth morning allowed a declaration. The target of 347 off 82 overs on a turning pitch proved too much as Kent's batsmen were unable to go on after making starts. Neil Smith's figures of 7/133 were a career best while fellow spinner Davis took the other three wickets.", "Lancashire won the toss and chose to bat first. After losing both openers cheaply, John Crawley and Neil Fairbrother (76) put together a third wicket partnership of 164. Crawley's innings took him past 1,000 runs for the season, the third man to pass the landmark in 1994.

Despite missing Brian Lara the match with a knee injury, Warwickshire's top order performed well ending day two on 350/3. Opener Andy Moles scored 87 from 222 balls while Trevor Penney reached a sixth first-class hundred. Jason Radcliffe, making his first appearance of the season, added 69. The hosts collapsed on the third morning losing their last seven wickets for 28 runs, four of those fell to Glen Chapple. The clay pitch was now offering indifferent bounce and after making a good start to their second innings Lancashire themselves collapsed from 100/1 to 194 all out. Neil Smith took 7/42 and bettered his career best figures for the second successive home match. With rain threatening, the target was chased urgently, the last 72 runs being scored in 12 overs. Roger Twose's top score of 90 contained eleven fours and two sixes.", "Surrey chose to bowl first on a green pitch and made use of the conditions to reduce Warwickshire to 52/5. Paul Smith suffered injuries to his hand and elbow but batted on to score 34 in two hours while Graeme Welch and Dougie Brown (54) both scored maiden first-class fifties putting on 110 for the ninth wicket.

Opener Andy Moles scored his first century of the season and with contributions from Brian Lara (44) and  Twose (31), Warwickshire built a substantial lead by the end of the second day. The best support came from Neil Smith who scored 57 and added 131 with Moles for the sixth wicket. Moles remained unbeaten, his innings breaking the record for the highest at the ground. By the close of the third day Surrey had lost five wickets. The lower order scored quickly on the final morning but could not prevent a heavy defeat. Munton and Neil Smith bowled throughout the final session, Munton took 5/96 to end with match figures of 9/137 and Smith took four wickets.", "Winning the toss, Warwickshire batted aggressively in their first innings. Brian Lara top scored with 70 from 81 balls, which included 11 fours and a six; there were also fifties from Andy Moles and Neil Smith. In the field Nick Knight took five catches, equalling the county record, and affected a run out. Before the close Essex had lost two wickets to Graeme Welch. Essex batted unconvincingly and only saved the follow-on by four runs. Knight scored his first championship half-century for two years and Nasser Hussain added 53 but both were caught by Keith Piper who took seven catches in the innings, a county record. Tim Munton took the last six wickets to fall, five in a twelve over spell after lunch. Moles and Roger Twose shared a century opening stand and Warwickshire closed the second day on 156/3, a lead of 302. Twose was dismissed early on the third day and the last seven wickets added 106 to increase the lead past 400. Opener Knight was the mainstay of Essex's second innings, he scored more than half the total and was last man out for 113. The second highest score was 26 from Jonathan Lewis who added 79 with Knight for the second wicket. Munton dismissed Lewis and Hussain before Dougie Brown was introduced and took four quick wickets, Munton returned to take Knight, his tenth wicket of the match.", "Derbyshire won the toss and on a green pitch bowled first. Brian Lara struck his eighth century of the season including a hundred, off 94 balls, before lunch. He put on 160 for the fourth wicket with Trevor Penney (41) who was the only other batsman to pass 17. Tim Munton took three wickets as Derbyshire closed day one on 165/6. On the second morning Munton took the remaining four wickets in 23 balls to finish with 7/52, his seventh five wicket haul and best figures of the season.

Derbyshire captain Kim Barnett took the wicket of Moles which sparked a collapse from 190/2, his leg-spin took five wickets while off-spinner Matthew Vandrau claimed three. The second day closed with Derbyshire on 26/1 in pursuit of 342. Munton took two wickets in his opening spell to reduce the hosts to 35/4, from there wickets fell regularly with off-spinner Neil Smith taking 5/69. Wicket-keeper Keith Piper took seven dismissals in the innings, equalling the Warwickshire record for the second match running. He also took 11 dismissals in the match which broke the county record and was one short of the first-class record.", "Warwickshire won the toss and fielded first on an overcast day and slow pitch. Stand-in captain Tim Munton took an early wicket but Nottinghamshire dominated the first day with Paul Pollard scoring a century in 295 minutes. He shared hundred partnerships with both Graeme Archer (41) and Paul Johnson (63) as the visitors closed a curtailed opening day on 268/4. Chris Lewis dominated the scoring on day two, taking his overnight score of 20 to 220 not out by the time of the declaration. He scored 21 fours and 6 sixes in his innings, and added 157 in 27 overs with Kevin Evans. Warwickshire lost three wickets in the remaining 20 over session. Warwickshire were made to follow on despite lower order resistance from Graeme Welch. He scored a career best 84 not out sharing in an eighth wicket stand of 68 with Neil Smith and added 86 with tail-enders Gladstone Small and Munton. Following on, Brian Lara was dismissed for a duck which brought his season average below 100 for the first time. The hosts closed day three on 134/3 with Roger Twose unbeaten on 74. Twose and overnight partner, Trevor Penney, were both dismissed inside the first 10 overs of the final day to reduce hopes of drawing the match. Three other wickets fell before lunch and Nottinghamshire's victory was achieved 45 minutes after the interval when Munton fell to Lewis, his sixth of the match.", "Hampshire chose to bat first on winning the toss; they began slowly before a collapse of five wickets for ten runs in eight overs. The position of 129/1 had been built by Paul Terry who scored 71 and shared stands of 74 and 55 with Tony Middleton (18) and Giles White (30) respectively. They recovered from 139/6 with Shaun Udal adding 64 and Rajesh Maru scoring 32. By the close Hampshire had been dismissed, Tim Munton finishing the innings with his fourth wicket of the day and 500th of his career. Warwickshire dominated a curtailed second day, scoring 210 in three hours of play. Andy Moles was the sole wicket to fall, and that brought together left-handers Roger Twose and Brian Lara who shared an unbeaten second wicket stand of 156 in 28 overs. When play was abandoned Lara had scored 89 from 93 balls and Twose 84 from 121. The partnership was extended to 295, the highest for any Warwickshire wicket against Hampshire. Lara's score was his ninth century for the club and took him past 2,000 runs for the season. Twose's innings of 137 took five hours and contained 19 boundaries. After their dismissals the middle order looked to score quickly but rain again restricted play. Warwickshire closed with a lead of 205 and four wickets remaining. They batted on for 40 minutes into the final morning increasing the lead by 53 runs. Munton dismissed both openers before spinners Neil Smith and Richard Davis took over, taking the remaining eight wickets including a spell of five wickets in five overs.
