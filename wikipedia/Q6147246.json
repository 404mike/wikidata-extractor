The assistant manager at Norwich was Mick Wadsworth who recognised Mitchell's potential and took him to English Div 3 side Scarborough F.C after Wadsworth had taken over the north east coast club in the summer of 96. Mitchell joined for a 2-year spell, winning a young player of the year award and playing in the side that reached the Division 3 play off, despite being a fans favourite he was surprisingly deemed surplus to requirements in 1998. Mitchell then returned to his native Scotland to join Clyde. He accepted a new two-year deal to remain with club in 2000 and went full-time after the club were promoted. Mitchell became an integral part of the Clyde team, and won 3 Player of the Year awards in a row, becoming a fans favourite and Clyde Legend, rather controversially he joined Clyde's arch rivals Partick Thistle in 2002 playing there for 3 seasons, 2 of which in the Scottish Premier League, before a serious hip injury forced him to retire in 2005. After his retirement he underwent Hip surgery in 2008 to try and fix the damaged hip which proved successful however there was no chance of him playing professionally after this. He now works in the world of finance for Tesco Bank in Glasgow City Centre, he is still occasionally seen at Partick Thistle matches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clyde F.C.", "response": ["The Clyde vs Partick Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the Old Firm. The rivalry intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at Firhill for five years in the 1980s. The decision to groundshare was never fully accepted by either set of fans. After quitting Clyde on free transfer to sign for the Firhill club (newly promoted to the SPL) in 2002, Jamie Mitchell stated he was shocked by the reaction of Clyde supporters to the move. He referred to it as getting the \"Mo Johnston treatment\". Former Jags midfielder Scott Chaplain (once a signing target for Clyde) spoke of the \"competitive edges to those particular matches\" after playing in the fixtures many times. When talking about a possible groundshare again, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry saying \"the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\". Due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the Scottish Premiership, in the 2010s and Clyde's relegations to the lower leagues in the same period, matches between the two clubs became less common. However, by 2020 they found themselves in the same division (Scottish League One) once again, with a revived version of the Glasgow Cup also offering more meetings."]}, {"page": "Jamie Mitchell (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jamie Mitchell may refer to:", "* Jamie Mitchell, a fictional character from the BBC soap opera Eastenders, played by Jack Ryder", "* Jamie Mitchell (footballer), Scottish former footballer", "* Jamie Mitchell, musician in Vengeance Rising and Scaterd Few", "* Jamie Mitchell (director) of The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Jamie Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Scotland national cerebral palsy football team", "response": ["|Jamie Mitchell"]}]}}
