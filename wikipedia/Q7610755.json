In 1982, during the Falklands War many British troops came under the episcopal oversight of the Bishop to the Forces. The Archbishop of Canterbury decided to exercise his responsibility by giving his commission to any bishop visiting the islands. In January 2007, Stephen Venner was appointed Episcopal Commissary, succeeded by Nigel Stock in 2014.
