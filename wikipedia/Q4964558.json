Down the backstretch he was joined by John Woodruff.  For the second day in a row, the Nazi home crowd was seeing two black North Americans leading a final after Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe winning the 100 metres.  Along the home stretch, Kazimierz Kucharski came along the outside, with Brian MacCabe in tow, effectively boxing Woodruff on the rail.  Sensing the danger, Woodruff slowed, dropping to sixth place but giving himself free running room.  With a long relaxed stride, the tall Woodruff ran around the outside and past Edwards into the lead.  Heading into the final turn, Edwards again accelerated into the lead, but Woodruff stayed with him as both separated from Kucharski and Chuck Hornbostel.  With the trailers struggling, a path down the rail opened up for Mario Lanzi to run past them on the inside.  Through the turn, Edwards was unable to break Woodruff.  Coming off the turn, it was Woodruff's long stride that took the advantage over the smaller Edwards.  Now it was Edwards who was struggling as Woodruff pulled away with only half the straightaway to the finish.  Lanzi seized the opportunity to run past Edwards on the outside, but there was no time to run after Woodruff.", "| 1 ||align=left| Brian MacCabe ||align=left|  || 1:54.5 || ", "| 3||align=left| Brian MacCabe||align=left|  || 1:55.4 || ", "| 9 ||align=left| Brian MacCabe ||align=left|  ||data-sort-value=4:00.0| Unknown"]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Games medallists in athletics (men)", "response": ["|Brian MacCabeFrank HandleyHenry PackBill Roberts||3:19.2"]}, {"page": "MacCabe, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian MacCabe"]}, {"page": "England at the 1938 British Empire Games", "response": ["| Brian MacCabe     || 23      ||  Advertising   ||1 x silver"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1938 British Empire Games \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 440 yards relay", "response": ["|  || align=left|  || align=left|Frank Handley, Henry Pack, Brian MacCabe, Bill Roberts || 3:19.2 || 20 yards behind"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1938 British Empire Games \u2013 Men's 440 yards", "response": ["| 4 || 2 ||align=left| Brian MacCabe ||align=left|  ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1938 British Empire Games \u2013 Men's 880 yards", "response": ["| 2 || 2 ||align=left| Brian MacCabe ||align=left|  || 1:53.1e || Q, 4 yards behind", "| 6 ||align=left| Brian MacCabe ||align=left|  ||  ||"]}]}}
