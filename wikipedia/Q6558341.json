On 8 July 1996, her class at St Luke's Primary School in Blakenhall, Wolverhampton, England, was attacked by a man with severe paranoid schizophrenia wielding a machete.\nPotts' arm was almost severed in the attack, in which four children were also injured. Potts, who was 21 years old at the time, also suffered severe cuts to her head, back, and to both arms. In 1997, Queen Elizabeth II presented Potts with the George Medal.  Her attacker, Horrett Campbell, was sentenced to indefinite detention in a secure mental hospital.Potts suffered severe scarring, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. She was awarded \u00a368,000 compensation more than four years after the attack. The compensation was widely criticised as inadequate, especially by comparison with high libel awards. Potts subsequently worked as a counsellor and, in 2001, founded a charity, Believe To Achieve, based in schools in Wolverhampton. The charity aims to encourage independence and to increase self-esteem in children.Potts published an autobiography entitled Behind the Smile in 1998. A foreword was contributed by Cherie Blair. Potts went on to study a degree in counselling in 2004. In 2010 she retrained as a nurse at Wolverhampton University and then went on to become a specialist public health nurse.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blakenhall, Wolverhampton", "response": ["On 8 July 1996, as nationally reported in the news, a machete attack took place at St Luke's Nursery School in Blakenhall, when 32-year-old local man Horrett Campbell ran riot - stabbing 21-year-old nursery nurse Lisa Potts and six children aged between two and four years. He was arrested at his tower block flat in nearby Villiers House the following evening and committed for trial at Stafford Crown Court later that year. He denied the charge of attempted murder but admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent, but was convicted on seven counts of the more serious charge on 9 December 1996. Due to paranoid schizophrenia, he was detained indefinitely in a mental hospital on 7 March 1997 when a judge at Teesside Crown Court, Cleveland, ruled that Campbell was mentally ill."]}, {"page": "Brian Smedley", "response": ["Smedley was also a Deputy Senior Judge of the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus from 1989, and then a Senior Judge from 1991 to 1995, when he became a High Court judge.

In 1995, he presided at the trial of an IRA sympathiser for possessing 3.5 pounds of Semtex, and in 1997 at the trial of three members of an IRA bombing unit.  He presided at the trial Horrett Campbell in 1996, for a machete attack on teachers and pupils at a primary school in Wolverhampton earlier that year, praising the bravery of nursery nurse Lisa Potts, who sustained horrific injuries in defending the children and was later awarded the George Medal.

A man described as being in his mid-30s with a slight build whom parents had seen hanging around the bushes prior to the attack, jumped over a fence surrounding the children's play area and pulled out a large machete. As parents attempted to distract and stop the attacker, he calmly began slashing the machete indiscriminately at the adults and children. Three children and four adults, most notably Lisa Potts, were injured in the attack. Potts was a 21-year-old teacher at the school who suffered cuts to her head, back, arms, and one of her arms was almost severed in the attack. A parent chased the man out of the area towards a housing area known as Villiers Flats. Police surrounded the area, and approximately two hours later took away a man who turned out to be someone other than the assailant. The following day, after hours of searching the area, police arrested 32-year-old Horrett Irving Campbell in connection with the attack."]}]}}
