He is best known for his novels (particularly Jampot Smith, Henry's War and Smith, As Hero) and for his stage adaptations of classic works, particularly a series of Maxim Gorky plays for the Royal Shakespeare Company. His novels were praised for their lyricism and for their \"Chekhovian mixture of comic concision and pathos\". Anthony Burgess, in The Novel Now said \"Jeremy Brooks has come to considerable stature in Jampot Smith and Smith, as Hero: he has created one of the few really large picaresque characters in the post-war novel.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brooks (surname)", "response": ["*Jeremy Brooks (1926\u20131994), British writer"]}, {"page": "1994 in Wales", "response": ["*27 June \u2013 Jeremy Brooks, novelist, poet and dramatist, 67"]}, {"page": "Our Mother's House", "response": ["Our Mother's House is a 1967 British drama film directed by Jack Clayton. It nominally stars Dirk Bogarde (who only appears in the film's second half) and principally features a cast of seven juvenile actors, including Pamela Franklin, Phoebe Nicholls and Mark Lester, with popular British actress Yootha Joyce in a supporting role. The screenplay was written by Jeremy Brooks and Haya Harareet, based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Julian Gloag.Gloag, Julian.Our Mother's House", "Julian Gloag's novel was brought to Clayton's attention by his close friend, Canadian novelist Mordecai Richler, and according to biographer Neil Sinyard, Clayton found it \"instantly fascinating\". A 1966 letter from Gloag to Clayton suggests that 20th Century Fox was interested in producing a film adaptation and that Eleanor Perry had written a script, but it was acquired for Clayton by MGM and Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff. Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks (then literary manager of the Royal Shakespeare Company) to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\".Neil Sinyard, Jack Clayton (Manchester University Press) pp. 133"]}, {"page": "Work Is a Four-Letter Word", "response": ["The screenplay was written by Jeremy Brooks who adapted it the play Eh? by Henry Livings.
