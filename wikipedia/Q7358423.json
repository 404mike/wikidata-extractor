He described the set up at Bootham Crescent on his arrival as a \"shambles\", as training consisted entirely of running and was devoid of any actual coaching. He signed veteran players Roger Jones (goalkeeper), Alan Hay (defender) and Ricky Sbragia (defender), as well as young Stoke defender Chris Evans, which including Smith himself meant a complete change in the club's back line. He brought in striker Viv Busby as a player-coach. He then made  26-year-old striker Keith Walwyn his priority, and encouraged Walwyn to use his natural physical presence to become a greater threat in front of goal and unlock his potential. Smith retired from playing after steering York to a seventh-place in 1982\u201383, in which he made 36 appearances and scored 4 goals. He signed Sheffield United's John MacPhail on a free transfer as a replacement for himself.", "In May 1987, Smith was appointed manager at Sunderland, who had just been relegated into the Third Division for the first time in their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than \u00a320,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay \u00a310,000. Smith agreed to a \u00a340,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra \u00a310,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for \u00a380,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987\u201388. A 7\u20130 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with 93 points."]}, {"page": "Derby County F.C.", "response": ["* 1980\u201381  Roger Jones"]}, {"page": "Roger Jones", "response": ["Roger Jones may refer to:", "*Roger Jones (footballer, born 1902) (1902\u20131967), English football wing-half", "*Roger Jones (footballer, born 1946) (born 1946), English football goalkeeper", "*Roger Jones (American football) (born 1969), American football player ", "*Roger Jones (mathematician), American mathematician", "*Roger Jones (composer) (born 1948), British composer and musician", "*Roger Jones (physicist) (born 1953), American physicist and entrepreneur", "*Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh (before 1589\u20131643), member of the Peerage of Ireland and lord president of Connaught", "*Roger Jones (MP) (c. 1691\u20131741), British Member of Parliament for Brecon", "*Roger Jones (Adjutant General) (1789\u20131852), Adjutant General of the U.S. Army from 1825 to 1852", "*Roger Jones (Inspector General) (1831\u20131889), Inspector General of the U.S. Army from 1888 to 1889 (son of the above)", "*Roger Jones (poet) (born 1954), American poet", "*Roger Jones (pharmacist) (born 1943), British businessman", "*Roger Jones (physician) (born 1948), British general practitioner", "*Roger Jones (bowls), Welsh lawn bowler"]}]}}
