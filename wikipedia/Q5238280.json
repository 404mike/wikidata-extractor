He made arrangements of works by Bach, Handel and Chopin, in distinctively Elgarian orchestration, and once again turned his youthful notebooks to use for the Nursery Suite (1931). His other compositions of this period have not held a place in the regular repertory. For most of the rest of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that Elgar's creative impulse ceased after his wife's death. Anthony Payne's elaboration of the sketches for Elgar's Third Symphony led to a reconsideration of this supposition. Elgar left the opening of the symphony complete in full score, and those pages, along with others, show Elgar's orchestration changed markedly from the richness of his pre-war work. The Gramophone described the opening of the new work as something \"thrilling\u00a0... unforgettably gaunt\".Cowan, Rob, Review, Gramophone, March 2000, p. 61 Payne also subsequently produced a performing version of the sketches for a sixth Pomp and Circumstance March, premiered at the Proms in August 2006.Clements, Andrew, \"BBCSO/Davis\" , The Guardian, 4 August 2006.

During that period of illness, he was able to jot down only a few more notes for the symphony, and he knew he would not be able to finish it.  In December 1933, he said to Reed: \"Don't let them tinker with it, Billy \u2013 burn it!\"  But Reed kept the sketches, amounting to 172 pages.   After Elgar's death, George Bernard Shaw encouraged Reed to record his memories of Elgar; the book Elgar As I Knew Him was published in 1936, two years after Elgar's death.  The book included facsimile reproductions of many of the 172 pages of sketches and also the instructions Elgar had given Reed for playing them and his guidance on where each sketch fitted into the overall work.  Reed had also published the complete sketches in his article, \"Elgar's Third Symphony\" in The Listener (23 August 1935).
