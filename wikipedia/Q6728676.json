He spent most of his career in industry, where he came to understand and support the European Economic Community and was latterly a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), winning the West Sussex seat in 1979 by a record margin of 95,484 votes, which earned him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.

His opposition to appeasement was nourished by his witnessing first-hand a Nuremberg Rally in 1937, where he met leading Nazis Hermann G\u00f6ring, Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler at an SS cocktail party. He later described Himmler as \"the most evil man I have ever met\". He was in Germany for two months to learn German but did not keep up any fluency in the language in later life.Ziegler 2010, pp. 31 In 1938 he visited Barcelona, then under attack from Spanish Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. On one occasion a car in which he was travelling came under machine-gun fire, while on another a bomb hit his hotel whilst he was observing an air raid from outside.Ziegler 2010, pp. 30 Ziegler notes that the claim in his memoirs that the bomb killed those who had taken shelter does not tally with an earlier account in which he stated that nobody was hurt, and suggests that the story may have grown a little in the telling. In the summer of 1939, accompanied by his Jewish friend Madron Seligman, he travelled to Danzig and Poland. They made the return journey by hitchhiking and rail across Germany through mobilising troops, returning to Britain just before the declaration of war.Ziegler 2010, pp. 31\u20132"]}, {"page": "Leatherhead", "response": ["* Madron Seligman (1918\u20132002), Member of the European Parliament and friend of Edward Heath."]}, {"page": "Pro-Euro Conservative Party", "response": ["The party received an endorsement in The Independent from writer A.
