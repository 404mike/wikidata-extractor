The sluice is situated on the north side of the A161 road, which is named Goole Road to the east and Swinefleet Road to the west. The drain is actually in Goole Fields, since the parish boundary runs along Quay Road, which runs parallel to the drain on its east bank.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map The safety of the A161 bridge was raised in Parliament in 1939, when Mr Adam Hills MP for Pontefract stated that both it and the bridge over Earnshaw's Warping Drain to the west were unsafe, and that Goole Urban District Council had been in conversation with the West Riding of Yorkshire County Council for ten years, but had failed to reach an agreement. Captain Hudson, speaking for the government, replied that the road was scheduled to be widened, and that plans for new bridges would be available within six months."]}]}}
