Although initially shocked by his sentence, he regained his composure and continued life as best he could within the confines of the prison. He wrote a thirty-page autobiography entitled The Life of Henry Simms, from his Birth to his Exit and had many women visitors. He and a fellow prisoner, Mary Allen, became attached to one another, even though Simms would occasionally beat her. In an attempt to win his freedom he began to write to the King and various Secretaries of State claiming that there was a plot to assassinate the King and that he could reveal the details in return for a pardon. Little came of the ruse, some people were arrested, but on examination it became clear that Simms had concocted the story. Realising he was not going to be freed he made a statement claiming that he had been responsible for another crime absolving the man suspected of committing it, Black Sam, even though the stolen goods had been found at Black Sam's house."]}, {"page": "List of musicians at English cathedrals", "response": ["* 1829 Henry Simms"]}, {"page": "Holy Trinity Church, Bordesley", "response": ["*Henry Simms 1825 \u2013 1872"]}]}}
