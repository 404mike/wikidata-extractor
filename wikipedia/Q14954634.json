He was educated at Eton College and then went to Cambridge University.  His education was interrupted by the Second World War, in which he served for three years.  He was invalided from the army and then managed Sunningdale Nurseries; this had been purchased by his father and a cousin at the outbreak of the war.  He revived the fortunes of the nursery and then started in a career of garden design.  His first commission was for Lord Hastings at Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland.  He later worked for the Howard family of Castle Howard in North Yorkshire.  In the 1960s Russell worked with the wives of the 4th and 5th Dukes of Westminster in Eaton Hall, Cheshire, to develop the gardens that had been neglected for many years.  He later worked with the garden designer Graham Stuart Thomas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Garden design", "response": ["* James Russell"]}, {"page": "Eaton Hall, Cheshire", "response": ["Work continued in the gardens and grounds during the 20th\u00a0century.  The 2nd\u00a0Duke commissioned Detmar Blow, a pupil of Lutyens, to re-design parts of the gardens.  With Fernand Billerey, he removed the parterres, built a canal leading away from the house, added hedged compartments to the terraces, and a pond at the base of the terraces (now the Lioness and Kudu Pond).  During the Second World War, part of the parkland was requisitioned as an airfield, and in 1940 some of the garden buildings were damaged by a cluster of incendiary devices.  After the war, improvement of the gardens did not resume until the 1960s, when the wives of the 4th and 5th Dukes worked with the designer James Russell.  Since the early 1990s, the gardens have been further developed under the 6th\u00a0Duke and his wife, Natalia, working with the garden designers Arabella Lennox-Boyd and Vernon Russell Smith."]}, {"page": "Garden designer", "response": ["* James Russell"]}, {"page": "James Russell", "response": ["* James Russell (director), British music and events video director", "* James Russell (garden designer) (1920\u20131996), English garden designer", "* James Russell (born 1936), pseudonym of British author Terry Harknett", "* James Russell (law reporter) (1790\u20131861), Scottish barrister and law reporter", "* James Russell (judge) (died 1893), Chief Justice of Hong Kong", "* James Russell (Canadian judge) (born 1949), Canadian judge", "* James Russell (New Brunswick politician) (1824\u20131915), farmer and political figure in New Brunswick, Canada", "* James Russell (Scottish politician) (1846\u20131918), Scottish physician and Lord Provost of Edinburgh", "* James Russell (Newfoundland politician) (born 1940), educator and political figure in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada", "* James Russell (surgeon) (1754\u20131836), Scottish doctor", "* James Russell (inventor) (born 1931), American inventor", "* James Russell III, atmospheric scientist", "* James Russell (ecologist), New Zealand", "* James Russell (Australian footballer) (1931\u20131969), Australian rules footballer", "* James Russell (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer", "* James Russell (baseball) (born 1986), Major League Baseball pitcher"]}]}}
