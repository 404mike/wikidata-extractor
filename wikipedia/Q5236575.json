The investigators Rose, Beauregard, Mullins, Moore et al., who base themselves upon Ley's ideas, posit that \"gentrifiers and their social and cultural characteristics [are] of crucial importance for an understanding of gentrification\"\u2014theoretical work Chris Hamnett criticized as insufficiently comprehensive, for not incorporating the \"supply of dwellings and the role of developers [and] speculators in the process\".", "In contrast to the production-side argument, the consumption-side theory of urban gentrification posits that the \"socio-cultural characteristics and motives\" of the gentrifiers are most important to understanding the gentrification of the post-industrial city.Hamnett, 2000. The changes in the structure of advanced capitalist cities with the shift from industrial to service-based economy were coupled with the expanding of a new middle class\u2014one with a larger purchasing power than ever before. As such, human geographer David Ley posits a rehabilitated post-industrial city influenced by this \"new middle class\". The consumption theory contends that it is the demographics and consumption patterns of this \"new middle class\" that is responsible for gentrification.", "Phillip Clay's two-stage model of gentrification places artists as prototypical stage one or \"marginal\" gentrifiers. The National Endowment for the Arts did a study that linked the proportion of employed artists to the rate of inner city gentrification across a number of U.S. cities. Artists will typically accept the risks of rehabilitating deteriorated property, as well as having the time, skill, and ability to carry out these extensive renovations. David Ley states that the artist's critique of everyday life and search for meaning and renewal are what make them early recruits for gentrification."]}, {"page": "Urban geography", "response": ["* David Ley"]}, {"page": "Centre for Indigenous Theatre", "response": ["*David Ley"]}, {"page": "List of people from Swansea", "response": ["*David Ley, FRSC, geographer"]}, {"page": "Massey Medal", "response": ["*2013 - David Ley"]}, {"page": "Ley", "response": ["* David Ley, Canadian Geographer"]}, {"page": "Bill 28 (British Columbia)", "response": ["Government figures showed that foreigners, mainly Chinese, have purchased $1 billion worth of real estate in British Columbia during a five-week period in 2016.
