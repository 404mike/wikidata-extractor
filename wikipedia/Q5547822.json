It was first announced on 18 July 2007 that Taylor had been cast in the role of Ruth. The BBC describe the character as \"clever, hardworking and focused\", stating that she has wanted to be a doctor since she was eight, and graduated top of her class - working hard at the expense of her personal life. Taylor herself has commented: \"Ruth's very responsible and articulate, and seems pretty confident. But underneath it all, she's something of a troubled soul which hopefully we'll find out later on. She's very self-critical and won't allow herself to make any mistakes. But, for a junior doctor, the whole first year in a hospital is about making mistakes and learning from it. Ruth won't accept help from anyone; she thinks she knows it all.\""]}, {"page": "Georgia (name)", "response": ["* Georgia Taylor (born 1980), English actress"]}, {"page": "List of Coronation Street characters", "response": ["| Georgia Taylor"]}, {"page": "Casualty (series 23)", "response": ["*Georgia Taylor as Ruth Winters"]}, {"page": "Mark Letheren", "response": ["He has been in a long-term relationship with Georgia Taylor, ex-Casualty actress (Ruth Winters).
