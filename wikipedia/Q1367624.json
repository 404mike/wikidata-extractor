In 1828, he sent six pictures to the Norwich exhibition and in 1831 he showed one painting there, the last shown in public during his lifetime. After 1831, Vincent disappeared from public view, and was not heard from or seen by his friends again, despite attempts by his family to locate him. The botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing in his father's 1902 biography, recalled that \"George Vincent was well educated and brought up, but lost himself. My father, his cousin, vainly endeavoured to trace his end in London.\" In the catalogue of his pictures shown by the Society of British Artists in 1832, Vincent was described as deceased, but uncertainty surrounds both the date and cause of his death. He may have died before 14 April 1832, possibly at Bath in a workhouse, as a notice appeared in the Norwich Mercury on that day: \"Died lately at Bath, in his 36th year, Mr George Vincent, artist, son of Mr. James Vincent, of this city.\" The writer Ralph Hale Mottram described Vincent's death as \"completely mysterious\" and suggested that his wish to avoid creditors was a possible reason for his disappearance."]}, {"page": "R.H.

Many of the early temporary officers were former clerks whose standard of education was generally good and whose profession had a noted tendency towards social mobility.  Ralph Hale Mottram, a pre-war bank clerk, described the experience of receiving an army commission in 1915: \"never having wanted, or thought myself competent, to become even the most junior officer of a military formation, I had volunteered, first in the ranks and then, when I was told to do so, for a commission in the new great national army that won the war\".  Many of the temporary officers of this period lacked any prior military experience, not having attended a school with a cadet corps."]}, {"page": "Istv\u00e1n Szegedi-Sz\u00fcts", "response": ["*Introduction to 'My War' by Ralph Hale Mottram"]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Norwich", "response": ["|1953\u201354 || Ralph Hale Mottram ||"]}, {"page": "Bracondale School", "response": ["*Ralph Hale Mottram, writer and Lord Mayor of Norwich"]}]}}
