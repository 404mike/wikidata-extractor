When Henry's house is destroyed by a fire, he moves into the Woolpack pub and remains there permanently. Henry and Amos decide to create a business partnership and take joint ownership of the pub. Linda Hawkins, author of Emmerdale Farm: Celebration Edition 1000 Episodes stated that Henry and Amos are often \"squabble amicably\" but they are \"close friends and enjoy each other's company.\" Amos believes that Henry constantly holds him back from money making schemes and \"they constantly argue\". Hawkins added that \"underneath, Amos is devoted to Henry.\" Anthony Hayward, author of The Who's Who of Soap Operas noted that there was \"constant sparring\" between the two but it always remained \"friendly\". Hilary Kingsley, author of Soap Box, believed Henry was \"the perfect foil\" for the temperamental Amos. Of Amos and Henry's living situation, Pentelow explained: I'm not a pub person at all and Ronnie (Amos) and I often laugh about the dingy living quarters we're supposed to share. We fantasise about a lovely lounge upstairs and luxurious bedrooms. We do have separate bedrooms, by the way, despite what people say.\" Amos and Henry's partnership lasted seventeen years until Amos decides to retire, after suffering a stroke and a fall down some stairs. Hayward assessed that Henry was an \"emotional wrench\" and \"exasperated\" that Amos would give up on their business. Henry views Amos' decision as a selfish act but their parting is amicable because Henry is \"genuinely fond of Amos\".
