He was employed by Ferranti from the mid-1960s, where he worked on the Pegasus thermionic valve computer. He was involved in the standardization of ASCII and ISO 646 and worked closely with Bob Bemer. ASCII was first known in Europe as the Bemer\u2013Ross Code. He was also one of the four main designers of ISO 6937, with Peter Fenwick, Bernard Marti and Loek Zeckendorf. He was one of the principal architects of the Universal Character Set ISO/IEC 10646 when it was first conceived.\nHugh was an expert in the Gospel of Thomas and wrote several books about it. He was a Quaker, and also wrote about George Fox. His working papers on the teachings of Fox are held at Yorkshire Quaker Heritage Project.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "ASCII", "response": ["ASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for American Telephone & Telegraph's TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit ITA2, which was also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system. Bob Bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence. His British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work according to Bemer, \"so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer\u2013Ross Code in Europe\". (NB. Bemer was employed at IBM at that time.) Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called \"the father of ASCII\"."]}, {"page": "Gospel of Thomas", "response": ["*Gospel of Thomas Collection Commentary and Essays by Hugh McGregor Ross"]}, {"page": "Bob Bemer", "response": ["He served on the committee which amalgamated the design for his COMTRAN language with Grace Hopper's FLOW-MATIC and thus produced the specifications for COBOL. He also served, with Hugh McGregor Ross and others, on the separate committee which defined the ASCII character codeset in 1960, contributing several characters which were not formerly used by computers including the escape (ESC), backslash (\\), and curly brackets ({}). As a result, he is sometimes known as The Father of ASCII. In 2000, Bemer claimed to have proposed the term octet (rather than Werner Buchholz' byte) while heading software development at Cie. Bull, France, between 1965 and 1966. He also proposed the term hextet for 16-bit groups."]}, {"page": "Ferranti Pegasus", "response": ["Other people who worked on the Pegasus included Hugh McGregor Ross and Donald B.

Hugh McGregor Ross records that \"George Felton tells how, when Pegasus was new, he would borrow a front door key on Friday evenings so he could get in during the weekends. Then, alone in the building, he would start up the computer to sum a series to calculate the value of \u03c0 to a then record 10,024 decimal places. This was a good test of the reliability of Pegasus\". His computations of \u03c0 were records in their day 1957.
