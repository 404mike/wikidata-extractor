In the quarter-finals of the 2001 World Matchplay, Taylor crushed Part 16\u20134. In the quarter-finals of the 2002 PDC World Championship, Part was again whitewashed by Taylor in a world championship, getting beaten 6\u20130, as the world's greatest player went on to win his eighth consecutive world championship and his tenth world championship in all. However, Part gave Taylor a serious test in the 2002 World Matchplay final. Part, in superb form and with great belief, matched Taylor throughout the match. In a first to 18 legs contest, Part led 16\u201315. But Taylor stunned the Canadian by winning three legs in a row to emerge an 18\u201316 winner in what is now regarded as a classic final. Part's wait for a first PDC major went on while Taylor's dominance continued. In October 2002, Part again reached a major final at the 2002 World Grand Prix, but the result was a similar story. This time Taylor comfortably defeated Part 7\u20133 in sets, although Part recovered from a slow start and a 1\u20135 deficit to give Taylor a challenge in the last 4 sets. Taylor and Part were now considered the two best players in the world, but there were serious doubts over whether Part could beat 'The Power' having already suffered five televised defeats, including two whitewashes in the World Championship and the painfully close loss in the 2002 World Matchplay. Going into the 2003 PDC World Championship, Taylor was the heavy favourite. However, Taylor showed more vulnerabilities during the tournament than at the previous few world championships, with both Wayne Mardle and Dennis Smith managing to win 3 sets off of Taylor. Taylor also comfortably won an anticlimactic grudge match in the semi-final against Alan Warriner by 6\u20131. Part, as the number two seed, reached the final as well, with a 5\u20133 win over Jamie Harvey in the second round, with Part hitting a vital 161 checkout when it was 3\u20133 in sets and 2\u20132 in legs with Harvey waiting on 40. Part then crushed Chris Mason 5\u20130 in the quarter-finals, though Part's semi-final was considerably more difficult. In a testing game, Part defeated Essex-born Kevin Painter 6\u20134 in a match not unlike his 2001 semi-final with Rod Harrington.", "Part's other major results in 2006 were indifferent however, including Phil Taylor defeating Part 13\u20132 in the second round of the 2006 World Matchplay. The match was heavily hyped up beforehand with Part and Taylor having played many classic matches before and Part having beaten Taylor four times on television. However, their match at the 2006 World Matchplay was in complete contrast to their classic matches from the past, being a flat anti-climax throughout as Taylor played below average and Part played very poor throughout. Part also had another disappointing World Championship in 2007. This time he was eliminated tamely in the second round by Chris Mason. The defeat meant that Part had not reached the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championship since his epic world title victory in 2003, while van Barneveld went on to defeat Phil Taylor 7\u20136 in a similarly momentous final. But for the rest of 2007, Part returned to some of his best form. He reached three semi-finals of televised majors: US Open; the World Grand Prix, and the Las Vegas Desert Classic (though he could not defend his title in the latter). These consistent performances meant he entered the 2008 PDC World Championship as the 11th seed, though he was not considered one of the favourites for the event. Nevertheless, Part advanced steadily through the tournament, setting the tournament's highest average in the second round against Mensur Suljovi\u0107. He then came through a tight quarter-final against the 2007 PDC Player of the Year and third seed James Wade, winning in a deciding set 5\u20134. In the semi-final he faced Kevin Painter, reminiscent of his 2003 triumph; Part once again emerged victorious, 6\u20132 this time, and found himself in his fourth world championship final.", "* 2007: 2nd Round (lost to Chris Mason 2\u20134)"]}, {"page": "Bob Anderson (darts player)", "response": ["In 1996, Anderson won the WDC World Pairs event alongside Phil Taylor.
