Sykes produced a small statue of a young woman in fluttering robes with a forefinger to her lips. It was named \"The Whisper\" and is to this day unique to the Montagu family's Rolls-Royces. The statue is displayed at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu.\nSykes was also an illustrator under the pseudonym 'Rilette'.  His work appeared on the cover of many issues of the magazine Woman  published by Hutchinson and he designed many advertisements, especially for de Reszke cigarettes.", "link_mentions": {}}}
