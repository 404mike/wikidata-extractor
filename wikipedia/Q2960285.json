Sykes produced a small statue of a young woman in fluttering robes with a forefinger to her lips. It was named \"The Whisper\" and is to this day unique to the Montagu family's Rolls-Royces. The statue is displayed at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu.\nSykes was also an illustrator under the pseudonym 'Rilette'.
