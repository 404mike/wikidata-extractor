Following a very severe motorbike accident Stuart concentrated on home recording, which resulted in the album Embrace the Herd (1982) again on Rough Trade, and his first CD album Signal Path (1992) on the Chicago-based Feel Good All Over label, before fans persuaded him to enter the studio again. The result was the album Random Rules (1993) and featured Spike (guitar and viola), younger brother Andrew (drums) and London-based French songwriter Louis Philippe (keyboard and arrangements). A band was formed to perform Stuart's new material, which gigged, albeit briefly, in France and the UK. Another album, Cars in the Grass, followed. Stuart had also been recording in the US (the album Fine Tuning and six tracks on the album Barbara Manning Sings with the Original Artists (1993)), where he has acquired a small fanbase. Now based in the West Country, Moxham is still writing songs. A new album, The Huddle House, recorded as a duet with Philippe, with whom he has regularly performed, was released on Wonder Records in May 2007.", "Alison Statton, Spike and Simon Emmerson (later of Working Week and Afro Celt Sound System) formed Weekend (with Phil Moxham on bass) and several jazz musicians including Larry Stabbins, Harry Beckett and Keith Tippett."]}, {"page": "Spike", "response": ["Spike, spikes, or spiking may refer to:", "* The Spike (novel), a novel by Arnaud de Borchgrave", "* The Spike (book), a nonfiction book by Damien Broderick", "* The Spike, a starship in Peter F.
