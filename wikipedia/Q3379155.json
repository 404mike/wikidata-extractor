Pollitt replaced Albert Inkpin, who had attracted disapproval from the Comintern by opposing the \"Class-against-Class\" policy and perceived softness towards others on the left. On his appointment, Stalin told him, \"You have taken a difficult job on, but I believe you will tackle it all right\". Pollitt was selected as he had impressed people both within CPGB and Moscow as a Comintern loyalist and effective organiser, particularly when representing the Comintern at a meeting of the Communist Party USA in March 1929. Pollitt stated that he saw his role as defending the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) \"through thick and thin\". Unlike, Inkpin, Pollitt was willing to criticise the Labour party as \"social-fascists\"."]}, {"page": "Campbell Case", "response": ["The new round of prosecutions embroiled not only Campbell but also eleven other members of the Communist Party, including Willie Gallacher, Wal Hannington, Albert Inkpin, Harry Pollitt, William Rust, R.

There were very few constituencies where all three parties stood two candidates. In the past, the Progressive Party had encompassed the Labour Party, with candidates running in harness. That situation had recently ended when former Progressive Party councillor Harry Gosling became leader of the Labour Party. In its place there were a few Progressive candidates running in harness with Municipal Reform candidates. Among Labour's candidates were members of the recently formed Communist Party, such as Albert Inkpin."]}, {"page": "Inkpin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Inkpin"]}]}}
