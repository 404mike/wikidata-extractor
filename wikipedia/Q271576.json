They decided to change their name again. A cinema across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was \"strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies\". Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called \"Black Sabbath\", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed.Ozzy Osbourne: Behind the Music by VH1; first aired 19 April 1998. Making use of the musical tritone, also known as \"the Devil's Interval\", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track \"probably the most evil song ever written\". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.", "Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz (ex-Great White), drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, former Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted. \"We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album.\"", "Dio quit Sabbath following a show in Oakland, California on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band. Iommi and Butler joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985's Live Aid concert, performing a brief set of Sabbath songs.

Pantera showed a more extreme style on this outing, leaving behind its glam metal influences in favor of mid-tempo thrash metal dubbed \"power groove\" (groove metal) by the band. Although Anselmo still used Rob Halford-influenced vocals, he also adopted a more abrasive delivery. Darrell's more complex guitar solos and riffs, along with his brother's faster-paced drumwork were evidence of the band's extreme transformation. The album marked a critical juncture in the band's history. Many fans, as well as the band itself, consider it Pantera's \"official\" debut. Cowboys included the tracks \"Cemetery Gates\", a brooding seven-minute piece that focuses on death and religion, and the thrashing title track, which gave the band members their nickname and asserted their raucous personality and style.", "To promote its latest album, Pantera began the Cowboys from Hell tour alongside thrash acts Exodus and Suicidal Tendencies. In 1991, Rob Halford performed with the band onstage, which led Pantera (along with Annihilator) to open for Judas Priest on its first show in Europe. They also opened for other bands like Sepultura, Fates Warning, Prong, Mind Over Four, and Morbid Angel, and co-headlined a North American tour with Wrathchild America.

After spending nearly 20 years garnering mainstream success as frontman for heavy metal icons Judas Priest, having recorded 12 studio albums and selling nearly 50 million albums, Halford announced to the band on July 4, 1991 that he would be leaving.  However, he wouldn't officially depart from the band until May 1992, due to contractual obligations.  That same year, Halford would launch a new heavy metal band, Fight.  Fight would release two albums and an EP, before disbanding in autumn of 1995, when they were dropped by their label, Epic Records, due to sales falling below expectations.", "By September 1997, recording was completed on the album, now titled Voyeurs.  With the added collaboration of Reznor and Olgivie, the songs took on more of an industrial rock sound.  The band initially announced their name as Gimp.  After discovering another band was already using the name, they quickly changed their name to 2wo.  Voyeurs was announced for release on March 10, 1998.  One month prior to the release of the album, Halford would gain headlines after confirming his homosexuality to MTV.  Voyeurs was led by the single \"I Am A Pig,\" which filmed a music video, shot by gay porn director Chi Chi Larue.  The music video featured various porn stars and depicted non-explicit scenes of S&M.  While not banned, the music video received sparse airplay, due to its mature subject matter.  2wo also signed to East West Records for European distribution of Voyeurs.  A Japanese edition of the album on DML would include one bonus track, entitled \"In My Head.\"  Rob Halford's website would later publish two additional unreleased tracks from the Voyeurs sessions as MP3s; \"Shout\" and \"Scream.\"", "In 2003, Rob Halford reunited with Judas Priest, where he continues to front the band to wide acclaim.  After Lowery's tenure with Marilyn Manson ended in 2004, he continued to perform under the name John 5.  In addition to releasing solo material, he has served as guitarist for Rob Zombie since 2005.  In the years since, both Halford and much of his fanbase have adopted a warmer disposition in regards to the 2wo material.  Halford acknowledged a demand for a reissue of Voyeurs, stating \"Everyone's asking me about the 2wo.  The reason that we really haven't gone there yet is because we're trying to figure out all of the business side of that scenario.  When I separated from Sanctuary in London, they gave me the opportunity to buy back all of my Halford solo material.  You know, obviously the recordings and the photos and the videos and everything else.  So we did a really sweet deal there and then Sony BMG have been really cool about me gaining access to all of the Fight material, because that was originally on Epic.  The 2wo project was with Trent Reznor's label, Nothing Records, through Interscope.  And I wasn't really sure there would be that much demand for it, but the fact is that everybody keeps asking me about it and I'm really pleased about that.  'Cause, to some extent, I think that it was overlooked, because it wasn't metal as people know me for, but it was a fantastic collaboration with Trent and what I would like for people to hear are the original recordings that Trent first listened to.  And then when he became involved with Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie from Skinny Puppy in Vancouver, the three of us put our heads together and created that final CD.  So I think that it would be great if everybody had an opportunity to listen to the original songs, because they are a lot tougher, you know, they're a lot edgier.  They've got more of a rock/metal vibe going to them.\"  Several of these original versions were in fact published on Rob Halford's website in the early 2000s, under the name The Pre-Reznor Mixes (\"I Am A Pig,\" \"Water's Leaking,\" \"Leave Me Alone,\" \"Deep In The Ground\" and \"Bed Of Rust\").  They continue to circulate on the Internet amongst fans, but to date, neither the pre-Reznor mixes, nor the Voyeurs album, have been reissued.", "The band launched a series of tours to promote the album, the first being the Mechanical Animals Tour.  Prior to the tour, guitarist Zim Zum opted to part ways with the band, leaving under amicable terms in order to pursue outside projects.  He was replaced by Nothing Records label-mate John Lowery, who was fresh off his run with Rob Halford's 2wo project.  After joining Marilyn Manson, Lowery assumed the stage name of John 5.  The U.S. leg of the tour featured Nothing Records label-mates 12 Rounds performing as openers.  The band then announced a co-headlining tour with Hole, called the Beautiful Monsters Tour.  The tour would be ill-fated, however, due to conflicts between Manson and Hole singer Courtney Love.  This led to Hole departing the tour after just nine dates.  Manson subsequently enlisted Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy to take over select opening slots. Monster Magnet, who were already opening for Manson, assumed Hole's place on the tour's playbill, with the tour being renamed the Rock Is Dead Tour.  The final four dates of the tour were canceled out of respect for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre, which brought Manson arguably the greatest controversy of his career, as the media mistakenly accused him of influencing the shooters.", "Five years after the highly successful release of The Downward Spiral, Nine Inch Nails delivered their third album, The Fragile, in 1999.

In his 2011 documentary series Metal Evolution, Dunn further explained how Rob Halford of Judas Priest created a blueprint for power metal vocal delivery. His almost constant high-pitched singing became one of the main characteristics of power metal. The twin-guitar sound promoted by Judas Priest's duo of K. K.
