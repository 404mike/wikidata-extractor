He was the chief executive of Diageo, the world's largest whisky company, for twelve years between 2000 and 2013.\nWalsh was criticised in the press for what was seen as his excessive remuneration, but received admiration for his ability to build brands. He spent the majority of his career at Diageo and its precursor Grand Metropolitan. His most notable decision was the acquisition of the Seagram drinks company, which added Captain Morgan rum and Crown Royal Canadian whisky to Diageo's roster of brands.\nWalsh's tenure in charge of Diageo closely mirrored his behaviour as head of the Pillsbury food business: selling off non-essential assets such as Burger King and aggressively marketing a select number of \"core\" brands. He was disciplined regarding prices paid for the acquisition of assets. Towards the end of his Diageo career, he increased the company's exposure to developing markets such as India and China.\nIn February 2014 Walsh became the non-executive chairman of Compass Group, the world's largest catering company. His role as an advisor to Diageo ended in September 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester Metropolitan University", "response": ["* Paul S.
