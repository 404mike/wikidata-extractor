He clipped the original publication of the poem from the San Francisco Examiner and passed it on to DeWolf Hopper, whose performances brought it fame.  \nBorn in Liverpool, Gunter's family emigrated to the United States when he was six and settled in San Francisco. In 1879 he moved to New York.\nGunter was a playwright and prolific self-published novelist, novels that were translated into other languages and adapted several times into films. His Home Publishing Company also published Gunter's Magazine (1905\u20131907), featuring short fiction or serialized novels by himself and others. He also published others' novels, including ones by Richard Henry Savage and Gilbert Parker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1886 in literature", "response": ["*Archibald Clavering Gunter \u2013 Prince Karl"]}, {"page": "1888 in literature", "response": ["* Archibald Clavering Gunter \u2013 Mr. Potter of Texas"]}, {"page": "A Florida Enchantment", "response": ["A Florida Enchantment (1914) is a silent film directed by Sidney Drew and released by the Vitagraph  studio.

If he made an appointment to confer with a person at 3:15 P.M., as he always put it, at 15:15 hours, that was when they met. Those who arrived earlier waited; those who came at any time after 15:15 never conferred at all.\" Morison read the Anabasis in Greek, the Aeneid in Latin, and the dime novels of Archibald Clavering Gunter in English. \"He thought that people who were good with animals, particularly horses, were popular with their fellows and loose in their morals.  When he himself drove a horse, he brought it to a full stop by saying, 'Whoa, cow.'\" One Sunday Morison walked out of church when the minister preached that silver should be coined at a ratio of 16 to 1, telling the minister that \"he should never try to deal with a subject he obviously didn't understand.\" Of his neighbor, composer Edward MacDowell, Morison said, he was \"a man with whom I had absolutely nothing in common.\" Between 1893 and 1897, Morison, a bachelor, built a house of about 57 rooms so that he would \"have a place to eat Thanksgiving dinner and to watch the sun set over Mount Monadnock.\"Elting E.
