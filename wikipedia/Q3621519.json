He clipped the original publication of the poem from the San Francisco Examiner and passed it on to DeWolf Hopper, whose performances brought it fame.  \nBorn in Liverpool, Gunter's family emigrated to the United States when he was six and settled in San Francisco. In 1879 he moved to New York.\nGunter was a playwright and prolific self-published novelist, novels that were translated into other languages and adapted several times into films. His Home Publishing Company also published Gunter's Magazine (1905\u20131907), featuring short fiction or serialized novels by himself and others. He also published others' novels, including ones by Richard Henry Savage and Gilbert Parker.", "link_mentions": {}}}
