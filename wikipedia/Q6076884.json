Isaac Newton Wigney (MP 1832\u20131839 and 1841\u20131842) was described as being of \"Whig opinions inclining to radicalism, in favour of the ballot, and pledged himself to resign his seat whenever his constituents called upon him so to do\". His colleague, the Nonconformist preacher and attorney George Faithfull (MP 1832\u20131835), went much further. He advocated \"the immediate abolition of slavery, of all unmerited pensions and sinecures, the standing army, all useless expense, the Corn Laws, and every other monopoly. He said that if the extent of suffrage at that time was not found efficient he would vote for universal suffrage: and if triennial Parliaments did not succeed, would vote for having them annually; he was an advocate of the ballot\"."]}]}}
