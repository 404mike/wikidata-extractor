Gardiner, like Henry, was dismayed that anti-papal sentiment was becoming anti-Catholic as well.  While he had supported the king's efforts to overthrow papal authority in favour of royal supremacy, he was now alarmed at where this might lead. Gardiner saw in Watson a kindred spirit and invited him to be his domestic chaplain \u2013 one of his personal aides.  So in 1545 Watson joined the familia of the Bishop of Winchester; he was no longer subject to Taylor, and now had the Chancellor's authority and support for his preaching. In 1546 Taylor was forced to resign as Master of St John's. Under Edward VI he would follow Henry Holbeach as the second (married) Protestant Bishop of Lincoln."]}, {"page": "History of Worcestershire", "response": ["Worcester Priory came to an end with King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries.
