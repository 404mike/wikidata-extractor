He later played for clubs including Partick Thistle, Doncaster Rovers and Leeds United before ending his playing career with Rotherham United. A serious head injury suffered in March 1993 brought about Buckley's retirement from playing at the age of 31.\nIn June 2003 Buckley became manager of Doncaster Rovers Belles and under him the club qualified for the FA Women's Premier League Cup final in 2009. The club had won on the last day of the season in 2004\u201305 to avoid relegation. In September 2008 Buckley was in charge when the club came close to folding due to lack of finances. Despite operating with a limited budget Doncaster Rovers Belles were named as founder members of the FA WSL in 2010.

Rovers finished the season in 14th place, some distance from the promotion and the relegation places.", "During the 1986 close season, Bremner spent \u00a3125,000 on 29-year-old Sheffield United striker Keith Edwards, and a further \u00a380,000 to bring in 31-year-old Carlisle United defender Jack Ashurst and Newcastle United defender Peter Haddock. Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (\u00a315,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (\u00a335,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986\u201387 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for \u00a3840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for \u00a3110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for \u00a372,000 and \u00a3200,000 respectively. A 2\u20131 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3\u20132 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1\u20130 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's. John Sheridan put Leeds ahead in extra-time of the replay, but two late goals from Peter Shirtliff changed the game and denied Leeds promotion."]}, {"page": "Doncaster Rovers Belles L.F.C.", "response": ["===John Buckley era===", "In May 2012 the Belles agreed a three-year, six-figure sponsorship deal with Innovation Financial Services, a Bawtry\u2013based company owned by ex-footballer Hugh McAuley & Doncaster businessman Stewart Groves.
