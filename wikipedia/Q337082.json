Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself.

Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare's plays, in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London's dominant playwright. The date of the first performance is unknown. The First Quarto, printed in 1597, reads \"it hath been often (and with great applause) plaid publiquely\", setting the first performance before that date. The Lord Chamberlain's Men were certainly the first to perform it. Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare, the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors, Will Kemp, instead of Peter, in a line in Act V. Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo, being the company's actor; and Master Robert Goffe (a boy), the first Juliet. The premiere is likely to have been at The Theatre, with other early productions at the Curtain.

His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.

If Jonson is taken literally, for the play to have been between 25 and 30 years old in 1614, it must have been written between 1584 and 1589, a theory which not all scholars reject out of hand.

From references in other contemporary works, Kyd is also assumed to have been the writer of an early, lost version of Hamlet (the so-called Ur-Hamlet), with a play-within-a-play interlude. William Shakespeare's Hamlet retains this device by having Hamlet ask some strolling players to perform the Murder of Gonzago. The action and characters in The Murder mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying \"the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\" Hamlet calls this new play The Mouse-trap (a title that Agatha Christie later took for the long-running play The Mousetrap). Christie's work was parodied in Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound, in which two theater critics are drawn into the murder mystery they are watching. The audience is similarly absorbed into the action in Woody Allen's play God, which is about two failed playwrights in Ancient Greece.

Printed by Adam Islip in London (1596)", "Thomas Nashe, in his introduction to Greene\u2019s Menaphon (1589), writes in a riddling way that seems to leave clues regarding the identity of playwrights who have left the trade of noverint (lawyer\u2019s clerk) to turn to writing, and who are being influenced by the Roman playwright Seneca, who \"if you entreat him fair in a frosty morning, he will afford you whole Hamlets\u2026\"  Nashe then writes that his followers are like the \"kid\" in Aesop.  The reference to \"Hamlets\" vouches for the idea that a Hamlet-play existed as early as 1589.  Other references are interpreted by some to contribute to the idea that Thomas Kyd, who was a noverint, and a Seneca-influenced playwright, and whose name is a homophone of Aesop\u2019s \"kid\", might be the author of the Hamlet that Nashe mentions.Jenkins, p.83\u20134", "In 2016 Professor Terri Bourus, one of three General Editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare, https://english.fsu.edu/faculty/terri-bourus   in her paper \"Enter Shakespeare\u2019s Young Hamlet, 1589\" suggests that Shakespeare was \"interested in sixteenth-century French literature, from the very beginning of his career\" and therefore \"did not need Thomas Kyd to pre-digest Belleforest\u2019s histoire of Amleth and spoon-feed it to him\". She considers that the hypothesized Ur-Hamlet is Shakespeare\u2019s Q1 text, and that this derived directly from Belleforest\u2019s French version.Terri Bourus in Actes des Congr\u00e8s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise Shakespeare 34 (2016): pp.2-5. Elsewhere Bourus, after referring to Goethe's UrFaust or original version of Faust,  argues that, \"Like Faust\u2026Hamlet was repeatedly revised by its author. As Faust matured with Goethe, Hamlet matured with Shakespeare. It matters so much to us, in part, because it mattered so much to him.\" Terri Bourus, Young Shakespeare\u2019s Young Hamlet: Print, Piracy, and Performance (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 210.

The play has been variously attributed to Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene, George Peele, Thomas Lodge, Anthony Munday, and Shakespeare himself.Logan and Smith, pp. 219\u201320.", "Category:Plays by Thomas Kyd"]}, {"page": "Chronology of Shakespeare's plays", "response": [":Evidence: stylistically, Midsummer Night is very much part of the 'lyrical plays', which would suggest a date of composition in 1594 or 1595. A strong argument that it was written immediately after Romeo and Juliet is the nature of Pyramus and Thisbe, which features a pair of ill-fated lovers who arrange to meet in secret and which ends with the heroine killing herself over the body of her dead love. In his 1979 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, Harold F. Brooks argues that Shakespeare used the source story from Ovid's Metamorphoses first to examine the tragic potential and then to exploit its comic and farcical elements in his next play. A possible topical allusion is the line \"the death/Of learning, late decreased in beggary\" (5.1.52\u201353), which could refer to the spate of deaths of popular playwrights in the early 1590s; Robert Greene in 1592, Christopher Marlowe in 1593 and Thomas Kyd in 1594. That the play culminates with the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta has led some to theorise it may have been written specifically for a wedding, with the most likely candidates being either the marriage of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, and Elizabeth de Vere on 26 January 1595, or that of Sir Thomas Berkeley and Elizabeth Carey on 19 February 1596. That the second is the more likely of the two is due to the fact that Elizabeth's grandfather was Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, and her father was George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, successive patrons of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. If the play was written for a wedding in February 1596, it was most likely composed in 1595. However, there is no solid evidence to suggest that the play was in fact written for a wedding, and most scholars are in agreement that stylistic evidence alone is sufficient to date the play to c.1595."]}, {"page": "Parnassus plays", "response": ["It is thought that the two students, Studioso and Philomusus are in part portrayals of Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd. Of course Shakespeare never attended university, but for the students there might be some satiric pleasure in imagining such a character attempting Cambridge, meeting failure, and in the end being forced to return to the country life from whence he came, as occurs in the plays."]}]}}
