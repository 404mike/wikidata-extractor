Julia Lagoutte writes in the OpenDemocracy: \"It is simply not true that tribal people have been \"unchanged for thousands of years\"; they have been evolving constantly, as we have. It is clear that for Nelson, their attraction and purity is rooted in their exclusion from the future, and their containment to the past \u2013 so that is the only reality he presents in his photos. By omitting their interactions with the \u2018modern world\u2019 that they are a part of, and perpetuating the myth that they are dying out, Nelson's work freezes tribal peoples in the past and effectively denies them a place in this world.\" Nelson's project Before They Pass Away came under attack from Stephen Corry, director of Survival International , the global movement for tribal peoples\u2019 rights. Corry attacked Nelson's work for presenting a false and damaging picture of tribal peoples. Corry maintained that Nelson's pictures bore little relationship either to how the people look now, or to how they've ever appeared. Papuan tribal leader Benny Wenda has also criticized Nelson for describing his tribe as \"headhunters\", when in fact the Dani have never practised cannibalism.  Nelson also received criticism from fellow photographers, such as Timothy Allen, a veteran photographer for the BBC's Human Planet. He states that, \"the patronizing and self-aggrandizing narrative behind 'Before They Pass Away' is literally painful to watch.\" "]}, {"page": "Christmas University Challenge", "response": ["The 2019 series was won by the University of Leeds whose team of Jonathan Clements, Henry Gee, Richard Coles and Timothy Allen beat Wadham College, Oxford and their team of Jonathan Freedland, Tom Solomon, Anne McElvoy and Roger Mosey."]}, {"page": "Allen, Timothy", "response": ["#redirectTimothy Allen"]}]}}
