This set up a second round tie against local rivals The Wednesday in a match that was preceded by torrential rain. Nevertheless, both teams attacked from the offset and The Wednesday took a two-goal lead in the opening ten minutes, the only goals United would concede en route to the final. United rallied and, after wasting several chances, goals from Tommy Sampy and George Green drew them level before half-time. Another goal by Sampy early in the second half gave United a 3\u20132 win.", "In contrast, Sheffield United's forward players were deemed to be the team's strength by The Times, especially the inside-forward pairing of club captain Billy Gillespie and Fred Tunstall. The side's defence were seen to be considerably weaker; The Times predicted that the match could \"turn into an ordeal\" for goalkeeper Sutcliffe, whose brother John had played in goal for Bolton Wanderers when they lost in the 1894 FA Cup Final. United's Boyle and Harry Johnson were appearing in their first FA Cup final. Their fathers, Peter Boyle and Harry Johnson Sr, had both won the FA Cup with United in 1902. Sampy, who had scored two goals in the second round, was dropped in favour of Boyle to provide more physicality in the forward line. The Express described the United side as \"good cup fighters with a workmanlike rather than polished team\".", "|FW || Harry Johnson"]}, {"page": "1902\u201303 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Harry Johnson"]}, {"page": "Harry Johnson (1876-1940)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Johnson (footballer, born 1876)"]}, {"page": "Harry Johnson (footballer born 1876)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Johnson (footballer, born 1876)"]}, {"page": "List of English association football families", "response": ["* Harry Johnson Snr., Harry Johnson Jr. (son), Tom Johnson (son)"]}]}}
