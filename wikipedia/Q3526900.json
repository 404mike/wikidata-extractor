Statistically, he holds the lowest lifetime Test bowling average among bowlers with more than fifteen wickets and he has the second highest peak rating for a bowler in the ICC ratings. He also holds the record for the lowest strike rate (balls bowled between each wicket taken) in all Test history.\nHe bowled at around medium pace and on English pitches of his time could gain spin, so that when rain affected the pitch he was unplayable. Against the best batsmen, too, Lohmann possessed skill and guile, and he could vary his pace, flight and break deceptively, so as to worry batsmen on better pitches. He was the finest slip fielder of his time and in county cricket a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries for Surrey and averaged 25 in 1887.\nIn 2016, Lohmann was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 2", "response": ["*1865 \u2013 George Lohmann, English cricketer (d. 1901)"]}, {"page": "1901", "response": ["* December 1 \u2013 George Lohmann, English cricketer (b. 1865)"]}, {"page": "1889", "response": ["* The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack publishes its first Wisden Cricketers of the Year (actually titled Six Great Bowlers Of The Year).
