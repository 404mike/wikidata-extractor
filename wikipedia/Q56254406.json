Torquay were 2\u20130 up at half-time with goals from Aaron Nemane and Ben Whitfield, before a head injury early in the second half saw keeper McGill substituted in place of new signing Nelson after the game was held up for 16 minutes. Crawley got a goal back through a Nichols penalty won by Nadesan after 83 minutes, before they equalised in the 14th minute of second-half added time through Watters. Torquay again took the lead in the 18th minute of added time through Josh Umerah, before Tunnicliffe scored tapped in with his right foot in the 21st minute of added time, to send the match to extra time. Asa Hall converted two penalties either side of half time in extra time to put the hosts 5\u20133 ahead, but two late goals from Nichols, in the 108th and 113th minutes respectively, completed his hat-trick and levelled the tie once again. Crawley won the tie in the 118th minute through Ashley Nadesan with a left-footed shot. Crawley were eliminated from the 2020\u201321 EFL Trophy after finishing 3rd, despite winning their final group stage match 2\u20130 at home to Ipswich Town; Brian Galach opened the scoring with a header from an Ashford cross after 17 minutes, before he scored his second goal after 55 minutes.
