He is best known for teaching and mentoring Ernest Rutherford. He was a natural teacher though an eccentric one, who taught science in an exciting way. His differences were not limited to teaching as he formed a socialist community in Christchurch, which he later set up as a theme park. His partial impact theory explaining the appearance of temporary stars was the major work of his lifetime.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1929 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 21 January \u2013 Alexander William Bickerton, chemistry academic (born 1842)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Bickerton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander William Bickerton"]}, {"page": "Partial impact theory", "response": ["Partial impact theory is an astronomical theory describing the partial collision of two stars and the temporary creation of a bright third star as a consequence.

At the candidates' meeting, Wilson argued with the current mayor, Henry Thomson, who acted as chairperson at the meeting, about the order of proceedings. Three positions were available contested by eight candidates, and James Gapes, Wilson, and Aaron Ayers were returned. Over the next day, five of the existing councillors handed in their resignation in protest over Wilson's election: William Pratt, William Radcliffe, George Ruddenklau, James Jameson, and Alexander William Bickerton. Radcliffe tried to withdraw his resignation, but this was not accepted by the mayor. Five new councillors were elected in a by-election the next month. Councillors were elected for one year at the time, and Wilson retired at the September 1879 election, when he did not stand again."]}, {"page": "Thomas S.

This stance was heavily criticised, but Weston won the point and Bickerton was removed from the teaching staff."]}, {"page": "Bickerton (surname)", "response": ["*Alexander William Bickerton (1842\u20131929), first Professor of Chemistry at the University of Canterbury, teacher of Ernest Rutherford"]}, {"page": "Professor Alexander William Bickerton", "response": ["#REDIRECTAlexander William Bickerton"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (A)", "response": ["*Alexander William Bickerton"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Alexander William Bickerton, physicist, was born in Alton"]}, {"page": "Wainoni, Christchurch", "response": ["Wainoni is a M\u0101ori word, with wai meaning stream and noni meaning a bend or turn.
