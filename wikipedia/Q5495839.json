Born in Hayfield, Derbyshire, he began his playing career in local-league football with Godley Athletic and Copley Celtic. In 1919, he joined Lancashire Combination side Stalybridge Celtic. The club was one of the founder members of the Football League Third Division North two years later, and Mace made one league appearance for them. Stalybridge left the Football League in 1923 to play in the Cheshire County League, where Mace was described as one of the best goalkeepers in the competition.\nIn May 1925, he was signed by Third Division North side Nelson, for a transfer fee of \u00a3100, as an understudy to Harry Abbott. He found it difficult to supplant Abbott and hence it was almost a year before he made his Nelson debut in the 3\u20133 draw with Chesterfield on 20 April 1926. It was another twelve months before Mace was selected for the team again, returning for the 6\u20132 win against Hartlepools United on 9 April 1927. He remained in goal for the following five matches, but the team suffered defeat in all five games and Mace was dropped following a 2\u20137 loss away at New Brighton. He made his final appearance for Nelson in the final match of the 1926\u201327 season, a 0\u20132 home defeat to Tranmere Rovers.\nDuring his time with Nelson, Mace was a regular starter for the reserve team and missed only one match as the side won the Lancashire Combination in 1925\u201326. He was offered a contract by the club for the 1927\u201328 season, but he rejected it and opted instead to move into non-League football with Macclesfield Town, where he ended his career.", "link_mentions": {}}}
