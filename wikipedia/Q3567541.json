In the book, Hall argued that inequalities in wealth and the production of luxuries led to the exploitation of the poor, and their suffering. Hall famously claimed that the exploitation of the poor was so severe that they \"retained only the product of one hour's work out of eight\".As a remedy for the problems in society, Hall proposed land reform and progressive taxation. His views and economic theory, particularly his views on severe exploitation of the poor, were important to the development of Marxism, and have led many to consider him one of the earliest socialists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Labor theory of value", "response": ["Based on the discrepancy between the wages of labor and the value of the product, the \"Ricardian socialists\"\u2014Charles Hall, Thomas Hodgskin, John Gray, and John Francis Bray, and Percy Ravenstone\u2014applied Ricardo's theory to develop theories of exploitation."]}, {"page": "Socialism", "response": ["Socialist models and ideas espousing common or public ownership have existed since antiquity. The economy of the 3rd century BCE Mauryan Empire of India, an absolute monarchy, has been described by some scholars as \"a socialized monarchy\" and \"a sort of state socialism\" due to \"nationalisation of industries\". Other scholars have suggested that elements of socialist thought were present in the politics of classical Greek philosophers Platopp. 276\u201377, A.E.

Moscow, 1974 instituted communal possessions and advocated the public good. Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, a Companion of Muhammad, is credited by multiple authors as a principal antecedent of Islamic socialism. The teachings of Jesus are frequently described as socialist, especially by Christian socialists.The Gospels, by Terry Eagleton, 2007  records that in the early church in Jerusalem \"[n]o one claimed that any of their possessions was their own\", although the pattern soon disappears from church history except within monasticism. Christian socialism was one of the founding threads of the British Labour Party and is claimed to begin with the uprising of Wat Tyler and John Ball in the 14th century CE. After the French Revolution, activists and theorists such as Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf, \u00c9tienne-Gabriel Morelly, Philippe Buonarroti and Auguste Blanqui influenced the early French labour and socialist movements.Thomas Kurian (ed).

This work influenced the utopian schemes of Thomas Spence.", "The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based on individual talent. Henri de Saint-Simon was fascinated by the potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism based on equal opportunities. He sought a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. His key focus was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was essential to progress.Newman, Michael. (2005) Socialism: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press,  This was accompanied by a desire for a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress. Other early socialist thinkers such as Charles Hall and Thomas Hodgkin based their ideas on David Ricardo's economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labour\u2014the cost of the labour (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.", "West European social critics, including Louis Blanc, Charles Fourier, Charles Hall, Robert Owen, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Saint-Simon were the first modern socialists who criticised the poverty and inequality of the Industrial Revolution. They advocated reform, Owen advocating the transformation of society to small communities without private property. Owen's contribution to modern socialism was his claim that individual actions and characteristics were largely determined by their social environment. On the other hand, Fourier advocated Phalanst\u00e8res (communities that respected individual desires, including sexual preferences), affinities and creativity and saw that work has to be made enjoyable for people.\"In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion\u2014this is the famous theory of \"attractive labour.\" Fourier sexualises work itself\u2014the life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, & activity, a society of lovers & wild enthusiasts....The Harmonian does not live with some 1600 people under one roof because of compulsion or altruism, but because of the sheer pleasure of all the social, sexual, economic, \"gastrosophic,\" cultural, & creative relations this association allows & encourages\".\"The Lemonade Ocean & Modern Times A Position Paper by Hakim Bey Owen and Fourier's ideas were practiced in intentional communities around Europe and North America in the mid-19th century."]}, {"page": "Henry George", "response": ["* Charles Hall \u2013 An early precursor to Henry George"]}, {"page": "Fleet Prison", "response": ["* Charles Hall \u2013 a notable economic thinker, and early socialist."]}]}}
