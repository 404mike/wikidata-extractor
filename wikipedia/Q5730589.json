He was appointed a Lecturer and then Reader at Imperial College before moving to City University London in 1985 as Professor of Mathematical Statistics (and Dean of Mathematics from 1987 to 1995). At City he co-founded the Engineering Design Centre.\nHe moved again, in 1995, to the University of Warwick as founding Director of the Risk Initiative and Statistical Consultancy Unit. He is currently, from 2003, Professor of Statistics at the Department of Statistics, London School of Economics where he leads the Decision Support and Risk Group.He was a founding president of the European Network for Business and Industrial Statistics (ENBIS) and a Co-Investigator on the Research Councils UK funded project Managing Uncertainty in Complex Models (MUCM). He is author of around 140 published papers and three books/monographs.\nHe holds the Guy Medal in Silver from the Royal Statistical Society and the George Box Medal from the European Network for Business and Industrial Statistics (ENBIS), is an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries and a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.\nHe was the elected President of the Royal Statistical Society in 1977, the first president to be elected by a contested vote. From 1834 to 1978, RSS Presidents had always been nominated and returned unopposed.  In 1978 however there had been a lot of opposition when Council arranged for Sir Campbell Adamson to stand for Council, on the understanding that he would stand for and become president the following year. However, for the first time in living memory there was an election for Council, and Campbell Adamson came last out of a 25 candidates. (There were 25 candidates and 24 place on Council.) Despite this, Campbell Adamson was put up for president, and Wynn was nominated as an alternative candidate.  Although Wynn was relatively unknown at the time, he won the election and completed his presidency.\nHe has undertaken a wide range of research in theoretical and applied statistics, focusing principally on model building. Projects with a biological focus include work in dynamic modelling in biology (multi-strain models).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Cox (statistician)", "response": ["Cox supervised, collaborated with, and encouraged many notable researchers prominent in statistics. He collaborated with George Box on a study of transformations such as the Box\u2013Cox transformation and they were especially delighted to be credited as Box and Cox.  He was the doctoral advisor of David Hinkley, Peter McCullagh, Basilio de Bragan\u00e7a Pereira, Wally Smith, Gauss Moutinho Cordeiro, Valerie Isham, Henry Wynn and Jane Hutton. He served as President of the Bernoulli Society from 1979 to 1981, of the Royal Statistical Society from 1980 to 1982, and of the International Statistical Institute from 1995 to 1997. He was an Honorary Fellow of Nuffield College and St John's College, Cambridge, and was a member of the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford."]}]}}
