He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the Championship in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion in the process. The following season he scored 11 goals in 19 appearances, before leaving for Liverpool on transfer deadline day in January, signing for a fee of \u00a335 million, at the time the record for a British footballer. \nDespite two goals on his injury-delayed debut, Carroll struggled for goals at Liverpool, moving on a season-long loan to West Ham United in 2012, made permanent a year later for a fee of \u00a315 million. He spent six injury-impacted years at West Ham, and was released in 2019 at the end of his contract. Carroll then re-signed for Newcastle, spending two years at the club until being released at the end of his contract in 2021.
