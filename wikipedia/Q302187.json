Its defenders often represented the feature as an inoffensive aspect of British culture, as when Conservative Party MP Richard Drax in 2013 called it a \"national institution\" that provided \"light and harmless entertainment\". Many of its critics considered it demeaning and objectifying to women, or as softcore pornography inappropriate for publication in a national newspaper readily available to children. Some politicians, notably including Labour Party MPs Clare Short, Harriet Harman, and Stella Creasy, Liberal Democrats MP Lynne Featherstone, and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, took stances against Page 3 and made efforts to have it removed from newspapers. Meanwhile, The Sun vigorously defended the feature, often responding to criticism with ad hominem attacks. When Short tried in 1986 to introduce a House of Commons bill banning topless models from British newspapers, The Sun ran a \"Stop Crazy Clare\" campaign, distributing free car stickers, calling Short a \"killjoy\", printing unflattering images of her, and polling readers on whether they would prefer to see Short's face or the back of a bus."]}, {"page": "Isle of Portland", "response": ["Weymouth, Portland and the Purbeck district are in the South Dorset parliamentary constituency, created in 1885.
