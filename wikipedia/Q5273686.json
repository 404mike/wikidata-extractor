He was born in Bedford, Bedfordshire and died in Cambridge.\nThe son of a clergyman, Dodds was a strong supporter of the Moral Re-Armament movement and cricket was, in his view, \"a reflection of the Great Creator\" and should therefore be played in a suitably dashing and creative style.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen Chalke", "response": ["* A Long Half Hour: Six Cricketers Remembered (on Arthur Milton, Geoff Edrich, Bomber Wells, Dickie Dodds, Ken Biddulph and Eric Hill) (2010, )"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Essex matches were noted for high scores as Essex themselves scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most. Their two outstanding players were the cousins Peter and Ray Smith who both completed the double. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect Trevor Bailey was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder Frank Vigar took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain Tom Pearce, Chick Cray, Dickie Dodds and Doug Insole. Wicketkeeper Tom Wade had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped.
