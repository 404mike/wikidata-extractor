Citing Palestrina as his model, Fux divided counterpoint into five species (hence the term \"species counterpoint\"), designed as exercises for the student, which deployed progressively more elaborate rhythmic combinations of voices while adhering to strict harmonic and melodic requirements. The method was widely adopted and was the main basis of contrapuntal training in the 19th century, but Fux had introduced a number of simplifications to the Palestrina style, notably the obligatory use of a cantus firmus in semibreves, which were corrected by later authors such as Knud Jeppesen and R. O. Morris. Palestrina's music conforms in many ways to Fux's rules, particularly in the fifth species but does not fit his pedagogical format."]}, {"page": "The Planets", "response": ["Mercury is in  and is marked vivace throughout.Holst (1921), pp. 44\u201372 The composer R.
