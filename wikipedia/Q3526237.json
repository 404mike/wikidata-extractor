In 1925, Australian Jack Scott first bowled a form of what would later have been called bodyline in a state match for New South Wales; his captain Herbie Collins disliked it and would not let him use it again. Other Australian captains were less particular, including Vic Richardson, who asked the South Australian bowler Lance Gun to use it in 1925,Frith, pp. 27\u201329. and later let Scott use it when he moved to South Australia. Scott repeated the tactics against the MCC in 1928\u201329.Douglas, pp. 79\u201380.Frith, pp. 28\u201329. In 1927, in a Test trial match, \"Nobby\" Clark bowled short to a leg-trap (a cluster of fielders placed close on the leg side). He was representing England in a side captained by Douglas Jardine.Douglas, pp. 59\u201360. In 1928\u201329, Harry Alexander bowled fast leg theory at an England team,Douglas, p. 83. and Harold Larwood briefly used a similar tactic on that same tour in two Test matches. Freddie Calthorpe, the England captain, criticised Learie Constantine's use of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field in a Test match in 1930;Howat (1976), p. 60. one such ball struck Andy Sandham, but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a complaint from the England team.Frith, pp. 31\u201332."]}, {"page": "Don Bradman", "response": ["In terms of runs scored, this performance was soon surpassed. In the Third Test, at Headingley, Bradman scored a century before lunch on 11 July, the first day of the Test match to equal the performances of Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney. In the afternoon, Bradman added another century between lunch and tea, before finishing the day on 309 not out. He remains the only Test player to pass 300 in one day's play. His eventual score of 334 was a world-record, exceeding the previous mark of 325 by Andy Sandham. Bradman dominated the Australian innings; the second-highest tally was 77 by Alan Kippax. Businessman Arthur Whitelaw later presented Bradman with a cheque for \u00a31,000 in appreciation of his achievement.Eason (2004), p 336. Whitelaw gave each of the other Australian players an ashtray.

While he was resident with the Harrises at Forest Hill, he continued to play for service teams and, in March 1946, he joined Catford Cricket Club. Some impressive performances for Catford, including ten for 21 against Bromley, were noted by Andrew Kempton, Catford's club president, who was a member of the county club. Kempton knew Andy Sandham, the former England opening batsman who was Surrey's coach in 1946, and recommended Laker. Sandham invited Laker for a trial at The Oval. Soon afterwards, on 17 July, Laker made his first-class debut when Surrey hosted a Combined Services XI, whom they defeated by six wickets. Laker had the creditable figures of three for 78 and three for 43. He was still in the RAOC but was demobilised in August. "]}, {"page": "Jack Hobbs", "response": ["Hobbs' success was based on fast footwork, an ability to play many different shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.", "When first-class cricket resumed in 1919,McKinstry, pp. 176\u201377. Surrey awarded Hobbs a five-year contract worth \u00a3400 a year.McKinstry, p. 184. During the season, he began to open the batting with Andy Sandham, who succeeded to Hayward's position as Hobbs' partner; in the following years, the pair established an effective partnership.McKinstry, pp. 179\u201380. In total, they shared 66 century opening partnerships and averaged over 50 for the first wicket.McKinstry, p. 396. Like Hobbs' other successful partnerships, this one was based on quick running.Arlott, p. 90. Sandham, even when successful, was often overshadowed by his partner; on one occasion, Sandham scored a century but the headlines were reserved for Hobbs' duck. Sandham usually played the subordinate role and Hobbs took most of the bowling.McKinstry, pp. 181\u201382.Marshall, p. 108."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket records", "response": ["|  Andy Sandham || || Sabina Park, Kingston || 1929\u201330||Test No. 193"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Andy Sandham"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Andy Sandham"]}, {"page": "Ken Barrington", "response": ["After a year he joined Reading Cricket Club as the assistant groundsman, a job that allowed him unlimited opportunity to practice cricket.

He took 30 wickets at an average of 13, but batted down the order.pp. 9\u201312, Peel", "In August 1947, Barrington was asked to join the groundstaff of the prestigious Surrey County Cricket Club at the Kennington Oval in South London for the following season. From April 1948, he commuted to London by railway for his training, having yet to see a first-class cricket match. The Chief Coach was Andy Sandham who thought his leg-spin bowling lacked accuracy (Surrey had Jim Laker and Tony Lock so did not need another spinner) and made him concentrate on his batting. Alec Bedser predicted that Barrington was a future Test player and Sandham later stated that Barrington was his best pupil. He worked on preparing the vast Oval ground for first-class cricket and played for the Surrey Club and Ground cricket team, though still down the order. In the 1949 season he only had time to play one game, making 52 against Kew, before he was called up for National Service.pp. 12\u201313, Peel"]}, {"page": "R. E.

Foster was (oddly) able to arrange to be away from England. Although one might have feared that he would be out of practice, in the first Test at Sydney in 1903, Foster scored 287. This was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930 (surpassed by Andy Sandham), and remains the highest score by a debutant and the third highest by a batsman of any nationality against Australia, home or away (surpassed only by Len Hutton's 364 in 1938 & Ross Taylor's 290 in 2015). For more than a century, Foster also held the record for the highest score in a test match at the SCG, his score not being beaten until Australian Michael Clarke scored 329 not out against India in January 2012. Foster did not follow it up, until the final Test on a vicious wicket at Melbourne, where he top-scored in both innings with 18 (in a total of 61 all out) and, having been promoted to open, an excellent 30 (out of 101 all out)."]}, {"page": "Learie Constantine", "response": ["Constantine returned to the West Indies to face England (represented by the MCC as was usual in those days) in a four-match Test series early in 1930.Howat (1976), pp. 58\u201359.

In the following match the West Indies recorded their first win in Test matches; after centuries from George Headley and Clifford Roach, Constantine took four for 35 and five for 87 to secure the victory.

In 1933, Copson became a regular member of the Derbyshire side, and, if he did not, in spite of his short run-up, possess the build to undertake as much work as fast bowlers were expected to then, he was consistently good in a summer unfavourable to bowlers. In the following two summers, Copson was so plagued by injury that there were serious worries about his long-term health.
