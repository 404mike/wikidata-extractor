Three members of the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, Georges Romas, Guillaume S\u00e9ron, and A. R. Upton, are also left off of some lists despite evidence that they participated in the first round. The roster for the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester as listed by the International Olympic Committee is Thomas Coe, John Henry Derbyshire, Peter Kemp, William Lister, Arthur G. Robertson, Eric Robinson, and George Wilkinson. Lister, however, had died two weeks prior to the Games, while Derbyshire, Robinson, and Wilkinson all played water polo matches in England either during the tournament or too soon after it to have traveled back from Paris in time. A list of players contemporary to the match does not include Robertson, but does list Coe and Kemp in addition to Robert Crawshaw, William Henry, John Arthur Jarvis, Victor Lindberg, and Frederick Stapleton. Lindberg has been considered the first New Zealand Olympian, although he \"was born in Fiji to Swedish and Irish parents, lived in New Zealand from a young age and, in Paris, represented a British club.\""]}, {"page": "Mixed teams at the Olympics", "response": ["Frederick Stapleton;"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in water polo (men)", "response": ["|rowspan=2 valign=top| (Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester)Thomas CoeRobert CrawshawWilliam HenryJohn Arthur JarvisPeter KempVictor Lindberg (NZL)Frederick Stapleton"]}, {"page": "Mixed team at the 1900 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|Frederick Stapleton (GBR)"]}, {"page": "F.
