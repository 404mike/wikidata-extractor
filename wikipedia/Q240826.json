Indeed, Holl has had the opportunity on two occasions to build next to Aalto buildings, with his competition-winning entry for the Helsinki Museum of Contemporary Art, named after his entry titled Kiasma (1993\u201398), built close to Aalto's Finlandia Hall, and Simmons Hall at MIT (2002) in Cambridge, USA, built opposite Aalto's Baker House (1947\u201349). But before Aalto, the first significant event in direct influence was Eliel Saarinen emigrating to the United States in 1923 - after having received second prize in the Chicago Tribune Tower competition of 1922 - where he was responsible for the design of the campus for the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Michigan. Often dubbed as the \"Architect of the American Century\", Eero Saarinen (1910\u201361), although born in Finland, the son of Eliel Saarinen, was raised and educated mostly in the United States, and created significant pieces of architecture throughout the United States, from the TWA Flight Center at New York's Kennedy Airport to the Gateway Arch over St. Louis - the style of each building varying considerably depending on the context and design brief. With his popularity, Saarinen was able to influence the choice of architecture in line with his own, as he did in the selection of Jorn Utzon's entry for the competition for the Sydney Opera House, Australia, as well as in the selection of Finnish architect Viljo Revell's entry for the competition for Toronto City Hall, Canada (1958\u201365).Mark Osbaldeston, Unbuilt Toronto: A History of the City That Might Have Been. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2008, p. 94. Another Finnish architect to find creative success after emigrating was Cyril Mardall (born Cyril Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, son of notable architect Einar Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m); he emigrated to England and in 1944 went into partnership with F. R. S. Yorke and Czech emigre Eugene Rosenberg to form the architectural firm Yorke Rosenberg Mardall, better known as YRM. A specialist in prefabricated timber houses, learnt from Finland, among Mardall's notable works are housing for Stevenage and Harlow new towns, as well as the Finnish Lutheran Missionary Church in London (1958)."]}, {"page": "Sir Colin St John Wilson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin St John Wilson"]}, {"page": "Colin Wilson (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Colin St John Wilson (1922\u20132007), British architect, lecturer and author"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2007", "response": ["*Sir Colin St John Wilson, 85, British architect, designer of the British Library."]}, {"page": "Bodleian Law Library", "response": ["The library is one of the largest open-access law libraries in Europe Opened in 1964, it now contains over 450,000 volumes on 16,000 linear metres of shelving, and is housed in purpose-built library accommodation designed by the distinguished architects Sir Leslie Martin and Colin St John Wilson."]}, {"page": "Sir Colin Wilson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin St John Wilson"]}, {"page": "Pallant House Gallery", "response": ["In 2006, Colin St John Wilson donated works by Michael Andrews, Peter Blake, David Bomberg, Patrick Caulfield, Lucian Freud, Richard Hamilton, R.
