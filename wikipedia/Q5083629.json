Despite its ancient origins very little of the medieval fabric of the city survives. Only two buildings from the earliest period are extant in Glasgow; the Cathedral and the former canon\u2019s house. Nor do the riggs and wynds of the old city remain, though a great deal of the original street pattern has persisted down the centuries. Additionally, a mere handful of buildings from the period between the Reformation and the end of the eighteenth century have come down to us.Dan Cruickshank, A Guide to the Georgian Buildings of Britain & Ireland, George Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd, 1985, pp.210-211. The majority of the city\u2019s building stock, then, is nineteenth century when the population of Glasgow rose from c. 78,000 in 1801 to 770,000 in 1901. The pattern of expansion can be traced from the commercial centre of the High Street and Merchant City westwards to the Blythswood Hill New Town laid out in the 1820s and 30s, and south of the river in Laurieston and Tradeston.A. Gomme, D. Walker, Architecture of Glasgow, Lund Humphries, 1968, p.92 The feus of both these developments were, unusually for the British Isles, laid out on a gridiron pattern. Further development came with the construction of the Woodlands and Park District areas, the latter of which was the work of Charles Wilson, in the 1830s and 40s. With the relocation of the University from the High street to Gilmorehill in the 1860s came the expansion of the city to the west where suburbs at Dowanhill and Partickhill were laid out on the garden principal with villas and cottages in a number of styles.F Wordsall, The City That Disappeared: Glasgow's Demolished Architecture, Richard Drew, 1981, p.11 Similarly, the coming of the railways and trams permitted the development of the suburbs of Pollokshields and Langside to the south. In 1866 the city corporation established the City Improvement Trust to control planning and clear slums. The outlying burghs were amalgamated into the City Corporation in 1891 and in the following decades the city witnessed its peak population of circa 1.1 million. With the post-war period came the proposals of the Bruce Plan in 1945 and the Clyde Valley Report in 1946. The former recommended the phased replacement of the entire city centre and its encirclement with a ring-road, of which scheme only the M8 at Charing Cross and Anderston was completed. The latter advised the displacement of the population of the City centre to New Towns and peripheral estates which led to the contraction of the city\u2019s population and the wholesale redevelopment of areas such as the Gorbals and Townhead.Glasgow Central Conservation Area Appraisal, City Design Group, Development & Regeneration Services, Glasgow City Council, 2012, p.12"]}, {"page": "1810 in Scotland", "response": ["* 19 June \u2013 Charles Wilson, architect (died 1863)"]}, {"page": "Peter Coats", "response": ["In 1850, he had a large mansion, Woodside House, built for him in Paisley.
