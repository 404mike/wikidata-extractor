For the first two years of its existence, it was known as the No More War International Movement. It became the British section of War Resisters International. Chaired by Fenner Brockway, it asked members to strive for revolutionary socialism but not to take part in any war.

The movement also received messages of support from several international figures, including Albert Einstein.Otto Nathan, Heinz Norden, Einstein on Peace. Simon and Schuster, 1960. (p. 91). In 1926, a member proposed the creation of a white poppy, in the manner of the British Legion's red poppies, but with the added meaning of a hope for an end to all wars. The group did not pursue the idea, but it was later taken up by the Women's Co-operative Guild.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations At its peak, the NMWM numbered around 3000 members, many from the Independent Labour Party. In 1929, several prominent British intellectuals signed a statement, \"Why I Believe in the No More War Movement\", supporting the NMWM's aims.W. J.
