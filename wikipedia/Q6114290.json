In preparation for the 1906\u201307 season, the league dropped the 'Amateur' tag from its name. The Church refused to have anything to do with this new-found professionalism, abandoning the club. The club replied by changing its name to Mansfield Wesley, and operated from then on as a professional club. Mansfield took advantage of this new-found freedom from the church by moving up into the Notts and District League, where they finished i a respectable 6th position in their first season. The final of the Mansfield Hospitals Charity Cup was also reached, however local rivals Mansfield Mechanics won 4\u20131. After a similar season the following year, the club showed signs of progression in 1908\u201309. Local lad Jack Needham was the star, picking up 46 goals in 35 games - earning himself a move to Birmingham FC - as Wesley finished 4th in the table."]}, {"page": "Needham (surname)", "response": ["*Jack Needham, English football player"]}, {"page": "John Needham (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jack Needham (1887\u20131961), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1916\u201317 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale started the league campaign well with a 2\u20132 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford and a 0\u20130 draw with Liverpool at the Old Recreation Ground. The squad was boosted by the arrivals of Ted Collins and Jack Needham, who signed after their club Wolverhampton Wanderers shut down operations. The pair \"showed their true regard for the game\" by turning up to play Stockport County on 16 September despite working until 6 am earlier that day; however former Valeite Bob Suart inspired County to a 5\u20133 win. Two more draws followed, including a 0\u20130 draw at Stoke, though this was then followed by five defeats in six games. The 13th game of the campaign proved unlucky for visitors Blackpool, as Vale recorded their first victory by a remarkable 11\u20131 scoreline, with Jack Needham, Holford, James Wootton, Albert Broadhurst and George Shelton all claiming two goals each, supplemented by a single strike for Albert Groves. They then beat Oldham Athletic 4\u20130, before dropping into a losing streak of seven defeats in nine games to prove the Blackpool result as an anomaly as the club dropped to last place. They recovered to lose only three of their final eight games, though the final day victory over Manchester United proved \"a farce\" as the visitors only turned up with four players and had to loan the other seven to make up a full team. Vale finished in 15th-place with 21 points from 30 games, whilst Needham finished as top-scorer with ten goals.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Jack Needham", "|1||MF||||Jack Needham||10||2||12"]}]}}
