He was later named by Everton supporters as part of the clubs' greatest ever side. He then transferred to Rangers in 1988, where he won the Scottish Premier Division in six consecutive years and the Scottish Cup once. Upon leaving Rangers in 1994, he signed for Tranmere Rovers, playing there until his retirement in 1998. He also played for the England national football team, gaining a total of forty-six appearances, and playing at the World Cup in both 1986 and 1990.\nIn 2002, Stevens graduated from the University of Salford with a degree in Physiotherapy.

For example, it was used for Paul Gascoigne (\"There's only one Paul Gascoigne\"), but modified for Gary Stevens (\"There's only two Gary Stevens\") since there were two players of the same name active at the same time. Other chants using the same tune include \"You only sing when you're winning\", and \"You're getting sacked in the morning\".

Then Robson gave a debut to the young Everton right-back Gary Stevens who was so impressive that Anderson found himself usurped again.
