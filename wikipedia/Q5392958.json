Born in the city of Limerick, Ireland, he went to school in Kingstown (present day D\u00fan Laoghaire) in County Dublin and then studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), graduating in 1909. He was selected to play rugby for Ireland in one match, against England in February 1909. His rugby career was cut short when he broke his leg in a match against Oxford University.\nDeane was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1911, after a period as house surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin. In 1913, he was posted to India and served in Burma. He was stationed in Meerut at the start of the First World War. From there, he travelled to France with the Garhwal Brigade of the Indian Expeditionary Force, landing in Marseille in September 1914. He was deployed immediately to the Western Front, where he served first with the 20th Field Ambulance and then as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Leicestershire Regiment. His unit saw much active service. On 22 August 1915, he was awarded the Military Cross after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four men who had been wounded by artillery fire. A month later, his regiment participated in the Battle of Loos, and was almost entirely obliterated. He was shot dead after going to help some injured soldiers: his action earned him a mention in despatches. Deane was one of 60 RCSI doctors to receive the Military Cross in the First World War, and one of 17 to be killed in action.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1887 in Ireland", "response": ["*4 May \u2013 Ernest Deane, military doctor and Ireland rugby player (killed in action during World War I 1915)."]}, {"page": "Army Rugby Union", "response": ["*  Ernest Deane"]}, {"page": "List of Ireland national rugby union players", "response": ["|Ernest Deane"]}, {"page": "Monkstown Football Club", "response": ["They have always had a military connection, with British Army soldiers among the players.
