After the war, he joined the Metropolitan Police, spending much of his career in Criminal Investigation Department (CID). In 1963, when holding the rank of Detective Sergeant, he was charged with corruption offences and was subsequently found to have been suffering from mental health problems and deemed not to be fit to stand trial. He was sent to a secure hospital, and on his release, he joined the firm of solicitors which had defended him. A public enquiry was held into his actions and why his health problems had not been noticed by his superiors.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe Orton", "response": ["Codron had manoeuvred Orton into meeting his colleague Kenneth Williams in August 1964.

He held up a banner reading, \"Lambrakis RIP\", referring to a Greek MP and peace activist who had been murdered.  According to Rooum's account, the banner was confiscated by a police officer and read by four plain clothes men.  Rooum asked, \"Can I have my banner back?\"  He was approached by one of the officers: \"This big one with the short-back-and-sides stepped forward. 'Can you have your what back?' \"'My banner.\"  \"He smiled at me.  'You're fucking nicked, my old beauty,' he said, and gave me a terrific clout on the ear.\"Rooum, Donald, \"I've dislodged a bit of brick\", Anarchy, No.36, Vol.4. No.2, February 1964 At the police station, the officer, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, \"took from his pocket a screwed-up newspaper, which he opened with a flourish.  Inside was a piece of brick.  His smile widened. 'There you are, my old beauty.  Carrying an offensive weapon.  You can get two years for that.'\" Rooum was a member of the National Council of Civil Liberties and he had, by good fortune, read some material on forensic science and so gave his clothes to his defence solicitor Stanley Clinton Davis for analysis. No brick dust was found in his pocket and Rooum convinced the magistrate that therefore no brick could have been there at the time of the alleged offence.Link to article on Challenor, mentioning Rooum's role in exposing him James Morton (1993) Bent Coppers pp.118\u20139 There followed a public inquiry that criticised the police and led to the imprisonment of three officers.Parliamentary question by Shirley Summerskill to Home Office ministers Report of Enquiry, by Mr A.E.James, QC, 1965 HMSO, Cmnd 2735 Rooum received \u00a3500 compensation (\u00a39,655 at 2017 value) and other convictions were overturned. Challenor was deemed mentally unfit to plead and was committed to Netherne mental hospital.

He received considerable public attention in 1963 when he appeared for the prosecution in the Great Train Robbery trial. In 1964, James was asked to chair the statutory inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Metropolitan Police's Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor's being able to plant evidence and assault suspects. In 1965 he was appointed a High Court Judge, assigned to the Queen's Bench Division. He received the customary knighthood on his appointment.  He was elected to an honorary fellowship of Jesus College in 1972. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1973 and was sworn as a member of the Privy Council accordingly.  He had a reputation as a hard-working judge. When he was a member of the Court of Appeal, it was once said (albeit with some exaggeration) that James made more decisions on criminal cases than the rest of his fellow judges put together, when taking into account decisions made without open court hearings."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2008", "response": ["*Harold Challenor, 86, British war hero (Operation Speedwell) and corrupt Metropolitan police officer."]}, {"page": "Tanky Challenor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harold Challenor"]}, {"page": "James Starritt", "response": ["He was Chief Superintendent commanding \"C\" Division at West End Central in the early 1960s and featured prominently in the 1964 public inquiry into one of his men, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, who continued to work despite having paranoid schizophrenia.
