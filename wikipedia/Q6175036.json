He is now assistant manager of the first team at the club to Stephen Baxter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crusaders F.C.", "response": ["|Assistant manager||Jeff Spiers"]}, {"page": "Liam Dunne (footballer)", "response": ["Dunne the tried a move to Portadown FC but did not work out because of an argument with the manager. Dunne then went to Dundalk where, in 2002 he won the FAI Ford Cup. It was a short successful spell for Dunne at Dundalk as he was linking up with players like James Keddy. But in 2005 Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter whom Dunne had played with for Crusaders came calling for him to come back to Seaview. It was an offer Dunne could not refuse. But by now \"Crues\" were in the second tier of Irish Football and were chasing promotion and they achieved it by winning the IFA Championship in the 2005-06 season. They had also won the Steel & Sons Cup that year. Crusaders went on to finish 6th in the IFA Premiership next season with experienced players such as Dunne and Jeff Spiers combining with younger players such as Colin Coates and David Rainey for a good season."]}]}}
