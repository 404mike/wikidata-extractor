He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and Balliol College, Oxford University. He was Head of the Department of Immunology at University College London from 1967 to 1992, and is currently Honorary Director of the Centre for Investigative & Diagnostic Oncology at Middlesex University, London, and is related to multi-award winning radio producer Colin Roitt.\nIn 1956, together with Deborah Doniach and Peter Campbell, he made the classic discovery of thyroglobulin autoantibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis which helped to open the whole concept of a relationship between autoimmunity and human disease. The work was extended to an intensive study of autoimmune phenomena in pernicious anemia and primary biliary cirrhosis.In 1983 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and has been elected to Honorary Membership of the Royal College of Physicians and appointed Honorary Fellow of The Royal Society of Medicine. He was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1964.\nHe is an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ivan roitt", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ivan Roitt"]}, {"page": "List of immunologists", "response": ["*Ivan Roitt (1927-)"]}, {"page": "Deborah Doniach", "response": ["Doniach was employed as a research assistant at the Royal Free Hospital then as an endocrinologist at Middlesex Hospital, London where she worked with the eminent thyroid surgeon, Rupert Vaughan-Hudson. Her observation of patients with Hashimoto's disease and knowledge of the field led her to realise that excess antibodies were an autoimmune reaction against the thyroid gland itself rather than external microbes. She collaborated with Ivan Roitt and Peter Campbell to further understand the autoimmune basis of Hashimoto's disease (citations).  Doniach continued her studies at Middlesex Hospital with various collaborators, including Roitt, Sheila Sherlock, Keith Taylor, and Gianfranco Bottazzo, and uncovered an autoimmune basis for numerous diseases, including pernicious anemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, and type I diabetes  This led to the concept of organ-specific auto-immunity.", "*Van Meter prize of the American Goitre Association (jointly with Ivan Roitt), 1957", "*Gairdner Award Toronto (jointly with Ivan Roitt), 1964"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Ivan Roitt, immunologist 1983JYB 2000 p211"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Middlesex University", "response": ["* Ivan Roitt (Director, Centre for Investigative & Diagnostic Oncology)"]}]}}
