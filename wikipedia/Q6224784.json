The property included control of the pocket borough of Wareham in Dorset, and while still three months short of coming of age he was returned as its Member of Parliament (MP) in 1786. He is not recorded as having spoken in the House during his first Parliament, and did not stand for re-election in 1790, but subsequently re-entered the House, representing Wareham again (1800\u20131806 and 1818\u20131831), Rochester (1806\u20131818) and Dorset (1831).\nFrom 1800 until 1828, Calcraft was a Whig, and served briefly as a clerk of the ordnance (1806\u20131807) when the party held power under Lord Grenville. However, in 1828 he accepted office as Paymaster of the Forces in the Duke of Wellington's Tory administration, and was raised to the Privy Council; but he broke with the Tories over parliamentary reform and returned to the Whigs in March 1831, voting for the Reform Bill in the crucial division on the second reading when it passed by a single vote. He was elected as a reformer for the county in the election that followed shortly afterwards, but becoming convinced that both sides in the Commons despised him he became mentally unstable, and later the same year he committed suicide.\nCalcraft married Elizabeth Hales, daughter of Sir Thomas Pym Hales, in 1790, and they had five surviving children. His two sons, John Hales Calcraft and Granby Calcraft, both became MPs for Wareham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paymaster of the Forces", "response": ["| John Calcraft"]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* John Calcraft, MP 1801-31"]}, {"page": "Ministry of All the Talents", "response": ["| John Calcraft"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1820\u20131837)", "response": ["*John Calcraft (1765\u20131831)"]}, {"page": "Wellington\u2013Peel ministry", "response": ["|John Calcraft||July 1828 \u2013 November 1830", "| John Calcraft"]}, {"page": "Rochester (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| John Calcraft", "|rowspan=\"3\"| John Calcraft"]}, {"page": "Clerk of the Ordnance", "response": ["*22 February 1806: John Calcraft"]}, {"page": "Sir John Burke, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["On 18 May 1812, he married Elizabeth Mary Calcraft, eldest daughter of John Calcraft at St James's Church, Piccadilly, and had by her four children, two daughters and five sons.

But at this point he fell out with Fox, who he believed should give up the Pay Office, and became more closely associated with Shelburne and Pitt, and there was talk that he would be offered an Irish peerage. However, he lost his office as deputy-commissary of musters when the Shelburne group joined the opposition at the end of 1763, and the vindictive Fox considered attempting to have him dismissed also from some of his regimental agencies; but in any case, he soon after retired from the agency business and turned his attention to finding a seat in Parliament. In 1765 he acquired Leeds Abbey in Kent and made considerable improvements and additions to the house and its grounds. On his death on 1772, he devised it with the rest of his estates, to his eldest son, John Calcraft.Parishes: Leeds, The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 5 (1798), pp. 478-502.

They had no children, but he had illegitimate children with at least two other women, Mrs George Anne Bellamy and Mrs Elizabeth Bride, both actresses.
