At the start of June Barry Robson agreed a deal with Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen, signalling his departure from Bramall Lane. Later that week youth Team coach and former assistant manager, David Unsworth, was given permission by United to speak with Kilmarnock about their vacant managerial position, but rejected the approach. With Barry Robson having already left the club, United subsequently announced their retained list, and signalled the departure of Danny Coyne, Matthew Harriott, Lecsinel Jean-Fran\u00e7ois and Dave Kitson. However they also indicated that Aaron Barry, Jordan Chapell, Danny Higginbotham, Jordan Hodder, Terry Kennedy, Callum McFadzean, Jahmal Smith and Elliott Whitehouse had all taken the option to have their contracts extended. Manager David Weir began to pull together his back-room team by appointing former Rangers fitness coach Adam Owen to the position of \"Assistant Manager \u2013 Performance\" on 21 June. A few days later United unveiled their first signings of the close season; Stephen McGinn from Watford, Sean McGinty from Manchester United and Febian Brandy from Walsall all on two-year deals; whilst Jasper Johns was signed from Everton signed a one-year deal."]}]}}
