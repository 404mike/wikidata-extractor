He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Radnor from 1799 to 1847.\nPrice was the eldest son Richard Price, a lawyer of Norton Manor, Knighton whose brother was Chase Price, the MP for Radnorshire.  He was educated at University College, Oxford.The Radnor seat was under the patronage of the 5th Earl of Oxford, whose uncle secured the seat for Price when a vacancy arose in 1799. Price developed his own support base, and within ten years was opposing Oxford's interests in Radnor.He was a largely silent MP, supporting Tory administrations, and by 1832 had spoken in the House of Commons only to oppose parliamentary reform.He died 10 April 1861, aged 88.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["By 1774, Oxford's newly created freemen were qualified to vote, but the returning officer (remaining loyal to Thomas Lewis) attempted to disallow the votes of all non-resident freemen. Once more the defeated Edward Lewis petitioned against the result, and was once more successful, the committee deciding that the non-resident freemen of New Radnor and Cefnllys were not entitled to vote but that those of the other three boroughs were; and even in New Radnor and Cefnllys the rights of the non-residents seem to have been restored at the following election. In 1780, the returning officer made a double return, and the Commons decided again in Edward Lewis's favour. From this point onwards, for at least the next thirty years, the Earl's right (and that of his son) to be considered \"patron\" of the constituency was unchallenged; when in 1790 he withdrew his support from Edward Lewis and instead backed David Murray, Murray defeated Lewis by a two-to-one margin.
