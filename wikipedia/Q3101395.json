Two English Romantics are largely responsible for raising the status of landscape painting worldwide: John Constable (1776\u20131837) and J. M. W. Turner (1775\u20131851), who is credited with elevating landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. Other notable 18th and 19th century landscape painters include: George Arnald (1763\u20131841); John Linnell (1792\u20131882), a rival to Constable in his time; George Morland (1763\u20131804), who developed on Francis Barlow's tradition of animal and rustic painting; Samuel Palmer (1805\u20131881); Paul Sandby (1731\u20131809), who is recognised as the father of English watercolour painting; and subsequent watercolourists John Robert Cozens (1752\u20131797), Turner's friend Thomas Girtin (1775\u20131802), and Thomas Heaphy (1775\u20131835).", "File:The Battle of the Nile.jpg|George Arnald's The Destruction of 'L'Orient' at the Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798; 1825\u201327."]}, {"page": "Henry William Pickersgill", "response": ["Born in London, Pickersgill was adopted in his youth by a Mr Hall, a silk manufacturer in Spitalfields, who financed his schooling and then took him into the family business.
