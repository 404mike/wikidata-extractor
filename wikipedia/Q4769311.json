According to a study from 2017 that was conducted in the USA 20% of married people consider leaving inheritance a priority, while 34% do not consider it as a priority. And about one in ten unmarried Americans (14 percent) plan to spend their retirement money to improve their lives, rather than saving it to leave an inheritance to their children. In addition, three in ten married Americans (28 percent) have downsized or plan to downsize their home after retirement."]}, {"page": "Eddie Yeats", "response": ["Eddie started working for Len Fairclough in 1979, fixing roofs. In April, he took possession of six hens and made a coop for them in Number 13's garden. He convinced Hilda to keep them by promising they would bring the Ogdens money. However, when the Ogdens were ridiculed for their ownership of the hens, Hilda made Eddie cook them for food. Eddie found himself facing prison again when he entertained his friend Herbie Cook (Joe Black) at Betty Turpin's (Betty Driver) house, where Eddie was insulating Betty's loft. When Herbie stole a clock, Eddie was suspected as he had a key to Betty's house, due to the job he had been given. Herbie would not admit taking the clock but Eddie convinced Betty not to tell the police. In 1980, now nearly 40 years old, Eddie was keen to settle down and marry, firstly dating Lorna Ferguson (Annie Hulley) then Pat Marshall (Barbara Pierson). Eddie began experiencing difficulties and lost his job at the builder's yard when Len took on apprentice Martin Cheveski (Jonathan Caplan) and sacked Eddie because there was not enough work for all of them. Eddie considered starting his own business, but his neighbours ridiculed the idea, so he took a job as a binman. The Ogdens let him live at Number 13 on hearing he was earning a reasonable wage."]}, {"page": "Sleepers (TV series)", "response": ["* Annie Hulley \u2014 \"Sandra Robinson\""]}, {"page": "Pat Sugden", "response": ["When Pat was originally featured in the series, Jack left her and moved away.
