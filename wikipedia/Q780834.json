Well-remembered series include John Cleese and Connie Booth's farcical Fawlty Towers (1975, 1979) often cited as the greatest sitcom of all time, and John Sullivan's Only Fools and Horses, (1976\u20131985, 2001\u20132003). Family-friendly  John Esmonde and Bob Larbey's self-sufficiency comedy The Good Life (1975\u201378) and To the Manor Born by  Peter Spence and Christopher Bond were also  highly  succcessful. Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?

Barker also starred (along with David Jason) in Open All Hours (1973, 1976\u201385), written by Roy Clarke. Clarke's long-running Last of the Summer Wine began in 1973 and ended in 2010, becoming the world's longest running sitcom. The decade also saw the broadcast of three sitcoms now derided by critical consensus for their racist content Love Thy Neighbour (1972\u201376), It Ain't Half Hot Mum (1974\u201381) and Mind Your Language (1977\u201379, 1986).", "Only Fools and Horses, (1976\u20131985, 2001\u20132003) is one of the most successful British sitcoms of all time and stars David Jason of Roy Clarke's Open All Hours with comedy actor Ronnie Barker) began in 1981 and ran for 64 episodes, with specials, until 2003.

It was voted Britain's Best Sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Del Boy was ranked fourth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. The series influenced British culture, contributing several words and phrases to the English language.  It was named one of the top 20 cult television programmes of all-time by TV critic Jeff Evans. Evans spoke of: \"[shows] such as Only Fools and Horses, which gets tremendous viewing figures but does inspire conventions of fans who meet in pubs called the Nag's Head and wander round dressed as their favourite characters.\" The theme music is by Ronnie Hazlehurst (1981) and John Sullivan (1982\u20132003).

Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke the opportunity to write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as he felt that the BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.", "The site for the exterior shots of Last of the Summer Wine was, in part, suggested by television producer Barry Took, who was familiar with the area. Took had, in the 1950s, toured as a stand-up comic, often appearing at working men's clubs. One such appearance was at Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth, and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Twenty years later, he returned to Holmfirth, where he filmed an episode of the BBC documentary series Having a Lovely Time, which turned out to be the highest rated episode of the show. When Took heard that James Gilbert and Roy Clarke were looking for a place with a centre surrounded by hills for their new television programme, he suggested the idea to Duncan Wood, who was at that time filming Comedy Playhouse.

New supporting characters were added to those from Last of the Summer Wine.

In 1983 Granada Books published a slightly different version of the first novel with Foggy in it instead of Blamire. In the late 1980s, Roy Clarke wrote two novels featuring Compo, Clegg and Seymour.

Bell responded that Radio Times has always been anti-Last of the Summer Wine, and Roy Clarke remarked that people who dislike the show \"shouldn't switch it on\" if they are \"too idle to turn it off\". A 2008 survey by County Life magazine, which named the show the worst thing about Yorkshire, was disputed by members of the Holme Valley Business Association, who said the show was good for business. The BBC wanted to cancel Last of the Summer Wine for years in favour of a new programme aimed at a younger audience, but the show remained too popular for cancellation; even repeats received ratings of as much as five million viewers per episode. The show came 14th in a high-profile 2004 BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom, and was praised for portraying older people in a non-stereotypical, positive, and active manner.

As a result, their relationship does not appear to have gone beyond hand-holding and gazing into each other's eyes (much to the annoyance of Marina), and the occasional kiss in a field, haystack, or mobile hut somewhere, and it is hinted that if Howard ever did get the chance, he would be too cowardly to go through with it anyway. It has also been suggested that Howard loves Pearl underneath it all. In later series Howard was shown to be out of the house more regularly (despite Pearl knowing about his attempted affair with Marina) and eventually became more involved in the schemes of the main trio. Howard first appeared in the Bournemouth summer season show of the series, and was popular enough and felt to have enough potential that he was soon made a regular character. At first, he, Pearl and Marina were used semi-regularly, but as time passed and their popularity grew, they appeared in every episode (particularly after Wally Batty died).  Howard and Pearl's surname was given as Sibshaw in Roy Clarke's novel 'The Moonbather' in 1987, but only mentioned once in the entire TV series, in one of the last episodes, when Glenda refers to Howard as Mr. Sibshaw.", "For the first few series in which she appeared, Edie was extremely concerned with her reputation in the neighbourhood: whenever there was company, Edie would try to put on a posh, educated voice\u2014which would suddenly vanish when she was shouting for (or at) Wesley. Edie's character was a prototype for Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances (also written by Roy Clarke). In the episode 'Who's That Bloke With Nora Batty Then?' Edie says the line \"Pegden residence, the lady of the house speaking\" in order to seem of a higher class. This would later be used by Clarke word-perfect for Hyacinth's catchphrase \"Bucket residence, the lady of the house speaking\". Once the latter series was created, this aspect of Edie's personality was toned down a bit (although not completely) in order to differentiate the two characters.", "Emerick returned to the role of PC Walsh in a set of shorts, written by Roy Clarke, two of which were released exclusively online.

In 2014, \"The Last Post\" was performed by the Lincoln Mystery Plays company at The Drill Hall, and based on the true story of the Beechey brothers. The Beecheys' were a local family in the First World War, who had eight brothers, all of which signed up to fight. Of the eight, five were killed and one was badly injured. The family's youngest daughter, Edith (Edie) and her mother Amy kept over three hundred letters from the brothers, all of which are now housed at the Lincolnshire Archives. This was then followed in 2018 by \"The World at her Feet\" written by local playwright Steve Gillard marking the 100th anniversary of WW1 and tells the story of women's' football in Lincoln during the war years. This was performed in November 2018 at the Lincoln Drill Hall."]}]}}
