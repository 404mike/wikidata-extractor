There was some opposition to these changes at the time. The writings of Jane Jacobs, in particular The Death and Life of Great American Cities provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation, and a record of community efforts to resist these changes. Lewis Mumford asked \"is the city for cars or for people?\" Donald Appleyard documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in \"The View from the Road\" (1964) and in the UK, Mayer Hillman first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in 1971.
