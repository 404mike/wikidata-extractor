He was born at East Preston, Sussex and died at Fownhope, Herefordshire. He disliked his first name and was generally known as \"Tom Haywood\".Haywood was educated at Cheltenham College. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman. He played for Somerset in seven first-class matches across the middle of the 1925 season, but achieved a degree of success only in the first two of them. In his debut match against Sussex at Horsham he scored 38 in the second innings, and this was to be his highest first-class score. Then in the following game at The Oval against Surrey, he made 14 and 36, though Somerset were trounced by a Surrey side that included three century-makers. Haywood reached double figures in only one further innings and he was no more successful when he returned for a single match for Somerset in 1927.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Esm\u00e9", "response": ["*Esme Haywood (1900\u20131985), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Haywood (surname)", "response": ["* Esme Haywood, (1900\u20131985), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Esme Haywood (1925\u20131927) 8 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Esm\u00e9 Haywood", "response": ["#REDIRECT Esme Haywood"]}]}}
