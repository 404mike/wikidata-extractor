He is known in particular for his three York studies of poverty conducted in 1899, 1935, and 1951. \nThe first York study involved a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class household, and his methodology inspired many subsequent researches in British empirical sociology.By strictly defining the concept of poverty in his studies, he was able to reveal that the poverty in York are more of structural rather than moral reasons, such as of low wages, which went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
