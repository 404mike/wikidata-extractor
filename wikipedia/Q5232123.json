Goodwin writes that he \"had a profound influence on the publishing of Australian poetry in the 1940s and early 1950s\".Goodwin (1986) p. 143-4 Goodwin goes on to write that \"More eclectic than he is often given credit for, he did have a distaste for rhetoric and declamation and a preference for the Audenesque air of jaunty reasonableness\" and that \"he was sceptical about large religious affirmation\".Goodwin (1986) p. 144 The Bulletin, along with Meanjin and Southerly were significant magazines for promoting the poetic achievement of writers and for establishing a cultural milieu in which younger poets could refine their skills. During his editorship The Bulletin published such poets as Judith Wright, Francis Webb, David Campbell, Rosemary Dobson, Chris Wallace-Crabbe, Randolph Stow and Vivian Smith. While working with The Bulletin, Stewart published six volumes of his own poems, co-edited two books of Australian poetry, and produced a number of verse-plays and a volume of short stories. He also contributed to the script for the award-winning Australian documentary, The Back of Beyond (1954).", "===Correspondence with David Campbell===", "David Campbell's first poem, Harry Pearce, was published in The Bulletin in 1942, but he and Stewart did not meet until the last year of the war.Persse (2006) p. 11 The two poets maintained a correspondence over a long period, from 1946\u20131979. The main subject of their correspondence was poetry, though they also covered \"fellow authors, fishing, nature and the land\". They discussed fellow Australian writers such as Judith Wright, R. D. Fitzgerald and Francis Webb; past writers such as Shakespeare, Wordsworth and W. B. Yeats; and also contemporary British and American writers such as Dylan Thomas, whom they both praised and criticised, and T. S. Eliot, whose later plays they did not like.Persse (2006) p. 13 In other words, their correspondence conveys their \"exploration and understanding of poetry\", particularly on the part of Stewart, who was \"one of Australia's finest critics\".", "Much of his writing took nature and the natural world as its subject matter. Sometimes, such as in his work of the 1950s, he focused \"intensely on the natural world, choosing small creatures and details close to the earth to exemplify larger themes.\"Falkiner (1992) p. 79 Examples are \"Frogs\" from his 1952 Sun Orchids, and \"The Fungus\". Other works, though, \"are more simply impressionistic imagery, and less thematically burdened\". An example is \"Brindabella\" from his Collected Poems 1936\u20131967. Although nature was his main subject, he, like David Campbell and Vance Palmer, \"did not write polemics about conservation. This became the concern of their immediate successors \u2013 Judith Wright, Mark O'Connor and John Blight\".Falkiner (1992) p. 129", "Persse, Jonathan, ed.
