C. Husband, was a leading British civil and consulting engineer from Sheffield, England, who designed bridges and other major civil engineering works. He is particularly known for his work on the Jodrell Bank radio telescopes; the first of these was the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world on its completion in 1957. Other projects he was involved in designing include the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station's aerials, one of the earliest telecobalt radiotherapy units, Sri Lanka's tallest building, and the rebuilding of Robert Stephenson's Britannia Bridge after a fire. He won the Royal Society's Royal Medal and the Wilhelm Exner Medal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lovell Telescope", "response": ["Both Bernard Lovell and Charles Husband were knighted for their roles in creating the telescope.

This was a -diameter radio telescope that could only point directly upwards; the next logical step was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.Lovell, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 28Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 195", "Two circular 15\" turret drive gear sets and associated pinions from 15-inch (38-cm) gun turrets were bought cheaply in 1950; these came from the World War I battleships HMS Revenge and Royal Sovereign, which were being broken up at the time.Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope; Henry Charles Husband, 1958, para 29 The bearings became the two main altitude rotator bearings of the telescope, with the appropriate parts of the telescope being designed around them.Lovell, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 29 Husband presented the first drawings of the proposed giant, fully steerable radio telescope in 1950.
