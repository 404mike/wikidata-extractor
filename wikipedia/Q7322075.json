It was released on 4 June 2012, by the Greco-Roman label, its remix EP, which features a re-cut of \"Control\" by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard, distributed in September 2012. The four-track record, which contains musical styles of balearic beat, UK garage, dubstep and techno, features vocal contributions from Sin\u00e9ad Harnett and Ria Ritchie. It was described by one reviewer as more a \"youthful\" release of a dubstep and techno scene consisting of artists like James Blake and Little Dragon. The EP is a big departure from their previous works in terms of musical style, its few post-dubstep elements to be the only ones that were also present on their past releases. Promoted one single, \"Boiling\", and one music video for \"Control\", The Face garnered critical acclaim, major praises being towards the quality of the EP's musical style and song structures.", "\"Control\", with its main instrumental element identical to that of the beginning of \"What's in Your Head\", contains an \"ethereal\" arrangement of restrained synth sounds, bass drops mostly associated with those in tracks by El-B and M. J. Cole, \"fidgety\" drums, and staccato note singing from Ria Ritchie. The track starts flowing into a \"widescreen reverb heavy fog\" containing sustained and echo-filtered vocals before the instrumental turns minimalist again, a structure compared by Simon Edmunds of contactmusic.com to the \"old loud/quiet/loud trick\" that was prominent in many tracks by rock band Nirvana. \"Control\" is the only cut on the release to have a 2-step drum rhythm, unlike the EP's three other tracks that are driven by four-on-the-floor drum beats. The Face closes with the most playful cut on the EP, the balearic techno song \"Lividup\". Including chopped voice samples similar to those of artists like XXXY and Hot City, West analyzed the track's \"upbeat euphoria is pasted over a backdrop of endless sunsets and bleary winkless nights.\""]}, {"page": "Ria (given name)", "response": ["*Ria Ritchie (born 1987), English singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "2012 UK Music Video Awards", "response": ["* Disclosure ft.
