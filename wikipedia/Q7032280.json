With a 46-game league programme, a run to the FA Cup fifth round, which included a 6\u20131 win over Telford United, the League Cup 3rd Round and participation in the Associate Members' Cup's Southern Qualifying Group, Derby played 60 competitive matches between 17 August 1985 and 12 May 1986, a club record, with Steve Buckley, Ross McLaren and Gary Micklewhite taking part in 58 games each. A buoyant feeling had returned to The Baseball Ground, and Cox was in his pomp, shaping a tightly knit group of players who each knew their jobs and respected each other which was supplemented with considered signings such as Phil Gee from Gresley Rovers and Nigel Callaghan from Watford. Following promotion the club won the 1986\u201387 Second Division at a canter, 6 points ahead of second placed Portsmouth and equalled the previous season's record of 84 points, though this was taken from 42 rather than 46 fixtures. After an opening day home defeat by Oldham Athletic the club went unbeaten at The Baseball Ground in the league for the rest of the season. Bobby Davison (who finished top league scorer for the fifth season on a row, with 19 strikes, taking his league tally to 82 in 5 years) and Phil Gee grabbed 32 goals between them, half of Derby's total, and Cox's team set a club record with 11 away league victories to secure a return to top-flight football after a traumatic seven years away."]}, {"page": "List of Watford F.C. records and statistics", "response": [":*UEFA Cup: 6, John Barnes, Nigel Callaghan, Richard Jobson (1 as a substitute), Wilf Rostron and Steve Sherwood."]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|Nigel Callaghan"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["|MF ||7 || Nigel Callaghan"]}]}}
