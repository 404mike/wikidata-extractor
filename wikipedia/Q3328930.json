On 17 May 2018, Thistle lost the first leg 2\u20131 away at Almondvale Stadium, with Kris Doolan getting Thistle's goal. Livingston then came to face Thistle at Firhill on 20 May 2018. Livingston won the away leg 0\u20131 after Keaghan Jacobs scored in the 46th minute. Thistle were relegated to the Scottish Championship after a stay in the top flight of five years. Subsequently, speculation surrounded whether or not Archibald would remain as Thistle's manager. On 24 May, Thistle announced on their website Archibald would remain as Partick Thistle's manager going into the Championship next season. As a result of Thistle's poor season, a number of players were not offered a new contract by the club including captain Abdul Osman, Callum Booth, Steven Lawless, Mustapha Dumbuya, Paul McGinn and Ryan Scully. Transfer listed players were Adam Barton, Niall Keown and Miles Storey. Australian midfielder Ryan Edwards triggered a relegation contract clause, allowing him to leave the club immediately. After a poor start to their 2018\u201319 Scottish Championship season, Archibald was sacked as manager on 6 October 2018 following a 2\u20130 loss to Ross County, leaving Thistle 8th in the Championship."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|24||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "List of foreign EFL Championship players", "response": ["*Mustapha Dumbuya \u2013 Doncaster Rovers 2009\u201312"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Portsmouth F.C. season", "response": ["*9 July: Portsmouth announces four players on trial: Jon Harley, Mustapha Dumbuya, Simon Eastwood and Laurie Walker.", "|DF ||  || 2 || Mustapha Dumbuya || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1", "| 2 ||  || DF || Mustapha Dumbuya || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|2||Mustapha Dumbuya||RB/RW|||| ||||27||0||Crawley Town||2 July 2013||Free||2015", "|2||DF||Mustapha Dumbuya||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Scottish Premiership players", "response": ["*Mustapha Dumbuya - Partick Thistle - 2015\u201318"]}, {"page": "All-time Phoenix Rising FC roster", "response": ["*  Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2015 || RB ||  || Mustapha Dumbuya || Free Agent || Released || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["| 15||||DF|| Mustapha Dumbuya", "|  Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "List of foreign USL Championship players", "response": ["*Mustapha Dumbuya \u2013 Phoenix Rising, Tampa Bay Rowdies \u2013 2019\u201320"]}, {"page": "Dumbuya", "response": ["*Mustapha Dumbuya (born 1987), Sierra Leonean football defender "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["|DF||||2 ||Mustapha Dumbuya"]}, {"page": "2019 Phoenix Rising FC season", "response": ["|align=left| Mustapha Dumbuya"]}]}}
