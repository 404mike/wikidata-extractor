Boland has written widely on specifically feminist themes and on the difficulties faced by women poets in a male-dominated literary world. N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in's poetry shows her interest variously in explorations of the sacred, women's experience, and Reformation history. She has also translated poetry from a number of languages. Higgins is an unconventional poet whose work confronts social injustices."]}, {"page": "List of Irish poets", "response": ["* Kerry Hardie (born 1951, E)"]}, {"page": "2007 in poetry", "response": ["* Thomas McCarthy and Br\u00edd N\u00ed Bh\u00f3r\u00e1in, editors, Best of Irish Poetry 2008, selections from 50 Irish poets published over a 12-month period, including Ciaran Carson, Harry Clifton, Kerry Hardie, Seamus Heaney, Biddy Jenkinson, Thomas Kinsella, Medbh McGuckian, Paula Meehan, John Montague, Bernard O'Donoghue, Robert Nye, Dennis O'Driscoll, Leanne O'Sullivan, Maurice Riordan, Billy Ramsell, David Wheatley, Liam \u00d3 Muirthile, Celia de Fr\u00e9ine, Cathal \u00d3 Searcaigh, William Wall, published October 2007 (Southword Editions)  (anthology)"]}, {"page": "2009 in poetry", "response": ["* Kerry Hardie, Only This Room, Oldcastle, County Meath: Gallery Press", "* Matthew Sweeney, Best of Irish Poetry 2010, Southword Editions, including work by Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Paul Muldoon, Michael McKimm, Leanne O'Sullivan, Leontia Flynn, Eva Bourke and Kerry Hardie"]}, {"page": "List of Irish women writers", "response": ["*Kerry Hardie (born 1951), poet and novelist"]}, {"page": "Gallery Press", "response": ["*Kerry Hardie"]}, {"page": "List of members of Aosd\u00e1na", "response": ["|\tKerry Hardie\t"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (A\u2013L)", "response": ["*Kerry Hardie (b. 1951, Singapore/Northern Ireland), poet & nv."]}]}}
