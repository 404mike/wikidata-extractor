Allegations were prompted by discussions among junior staff employed in the UK Parliament at Westminster following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations in Hollywood earlier in October, and the subsequent rise of Me Too. The journalists Jane Merrick and Kate Maltby made allegations against the Defence Minister Michael Fallon and de facto Deputy Prime Minister Damian Green, respectively. These led to the departures of both from Theresa May's cabinet, the latter after a two-month inquiry that also considered allegations that Green had lied about copious amounts of pornography found on his parliamentary computer. Both Merrick and Maltby cited the #MeToo movement as inspiring their allegations."]}, {"page": "2017 Westminster sexual misconduct allegations", "response": ["* Michael Fallon, the Secretary of State for Defence, resigned on 1 November 2017 because his behaviour towards women had \"fallen short\" previously. He told the BBC: \"The culture has changed over the years. What might have been acceptable 10, 15 years ago is clearly not acceptable now\". A day earlier, journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer alleged that he had repeatedly and inappropriately touched her knee during a dinner in 2002. Hartley-Brewer recalled that after Fallon kept putting his hand on her knee, she \"calmly and politely explained to him that, if he did it again, I would punch him in the face\". She later downplayed the incident. \"No one was remotely upset or distressed\", Hartley-Brewer said. It was later reported that Fallon had resigned shortly after journalist Jane Merrick had contacted No. 10 with the allegation that Fallon had tried to kiss her in 2003 by lunging at her. Fallon did not deny that this happened."]}, {"page": "Toby Helm", "response": ["He is in a relationship with fellow journalist Jane Merrick."]}, {"page": "Aaron Bastani", "response": ["Bastani has written for publications including The Guardian, London Review of Books, openDemocracy and Vice. Jane Merrick called Bastani a \"non-journalist\", but Bastani argued in 2015 that he is a journalist. The Quietus commented that he is known for \"regularly engaging in Twitter jousts\", and is regularly engaged in controversy over his views. In 2017, he tweeted a false claim about Labour's membership figures increasing by 150,000 that was widely repeated; Sam Burgon of the BBC suggested that the information could have originated from a typo by Richard Burgon, who tweeted the same claim shortly after Bastani. After speaking critically about the Remembrance poppy and Royal British Legion during 2018, Bastani was criticised in The Sun and by Labour MPs including Tom Watson, Nia Griffith and Kevan Jones."]}]}}
