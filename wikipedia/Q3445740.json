Since the 1960s, Ascott has been a practitioner of interactive computer art, electronic art, cybernetic art and telematic art.\nAscott exhibits internationally (including the Biennales of Venice and Shanghai), and is collected by Tate Britain and Arts Council England. He is recognised by Ars Electronica as the \"visionary pioneer of media art\", and widely seen as a radical innovator in arts education and research, having occupied leading academic roles in England, Europe, North America, and China, and is currently leading his Technoetic Arts studio in Shanghai, and directing the Planetary Collegium. In 2018 he became the subject of Cybernetics & Human Knowing: A Journal of Second Order Cybernetics, Autopoiesis and Cybersemiotics entitled \"A Tribute to the Messenger Shaman: Roy Ascott\". \nDr.Kate Sloan's comprehensive study of his early work \"Art Cybernetics and Pedagogy in Post-War Britain: Roy Ascott's Groundcourse\" was published by Routledge in 2019.He is President of the Planetary Collegium, Professor of Technoetic Arts Plymouth University, and the De Tao Master of Technoetic Arts at the DeTao Masters Academy in Shanghai.
