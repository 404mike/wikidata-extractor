Veteran of the previous five Boat Races, all of which were Dark Blue victories, Cambridge argued Rankov was ineligible for inclusion as he was a lecturer at the university. Coach David Townsend of the University of London offered the services of his crew to provide an opponent for Oxford, should Cambridge refuse to participate. Rankov himself had offered to withdraw from the race, but the Dark Blues' committee rejected this. Cambridge finally agreed to race after they reached an agreement with Oxford to discuss and possibly tighten the eligibility criteria. This ultimately led to establishment of the so-called \"Rankov Rule\", which states that oarsmen will compete in the race no more than four times as an undergraduate and no more than four times as a graduate."]}, {"page": "Bill Mason (rowing coach)", "response": ["In 1974 he was part of an eight that won Great Britain's silver medal at the 1974 World Rowing ChampionshipsResults: 1974 World Rowing Championships World Rowing and in 1976 went to his second Olympics, where the crew of Mason, Richard Ayling, Neil Keron and David Townsend reached the semi finals of the men's coxless four.
