Early devices for lie detection include an 1895 invention of Cesare Lombroso used to measure changes in blood pressure for police cases, a 1904 device by Vittorio Benussi used to measure breathing, the Mackenzie-Lewis Polygraph first developed by James Mackenzie (cardiologist) in 1906 and an abandoned project by American William Moulton Marston which used blood pressure to examine German prisoners of war (POWs).
