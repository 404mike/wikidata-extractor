He shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Robert Curl and Richard Smalley for their discovery of fullerenes. He was the recipient of many other honors and awards.\nKroto held many positions in academia throughout his life, ending his career as the Francis Eppes Professor of Chemistry at Florida State University, which he joined in 2004. Prior to this, he spent approximately 40 years at the University of Sussex.Kroto promoted science education and was a critic of religious faith.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 30", "response": ["*  2016   \u2013 Harry Kroto, English chemist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1939)"]}, {"page": "Fred Hoyle", "response": ["The second controversy came when the 1983 prize went in part to William Alfred Fowler \"for his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe.\" The controversy arose because Hoyle had been the inventor of the theory of nucleosynthesis in the stars with two research papers\"The synthesis of the elements from hydrogen\" MNRAS 106, 343 (1946); \"The synthesis of the elements from carbon to nickel\" Astrophys. J. Suppl. 1, 121\u2013146 (1954) published shortly after WWII.

C60 was not initially described as nanotechnology; the term was used regarding subsequent work with related carbon nanotubes (sometimes called graphene tubes or Bucky tubes) which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics and devices.

The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C60 (known as Buckyballs) and the fullerenes as the third allotropic form of carbon.", "This research is significant for the discovery of a new allotrope of carbon known as a fullerene.
