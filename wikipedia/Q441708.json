Nash is currently goalkeeping coach at Salford City.\nNash started his career at non-League Rossendale United and Clitheroe before being signed by Crystal Palace and then moved back north to Stockport County. He then played for Manchester City, Middlesbrough, Preston North End, Wigan Athletic, Stoke City for whom he helped gain promotion to the Premier League and Everton before re-joining Stoke in 2010. Throughout his career Nash was used mainly as a second and third choice keeper but did play regularly for Stockport and Preston.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 13", "response": ["*  1973   \u2013 Carlo Nash, English footballer and photographer"]}, {"page": "David Moyes", "response": ["Moyes recruited Steve Round as his assistant manager for the 2008\u201309 season to replace Alan Irvine, who had taken over as Preston North End manager the previous winter. Everton's first new player of the season, Lars Jacobsen, was brought in two games into the season. This was shortly followed by the signings of Segundo Castillo and Louis Saha. On deadline day, Moyes secured the services of goalkeeper Carlo Nash on a free transfer, and Marouane Fellaini for a club record \u00a315\u00a0million.

Speaking after being announced as Stoke's new manager, Hughes admitted that he had a point to prove following his disappointing spell at QPR. Hughes' first task was to release Rory Delap, Mamady Sidibe, Matthew Upson, Dean Whitehead, Carlo Nash and Matty Lund, at the same time giving Jermaine Pennant a new contract. He made his first signing on 28 June 2013 in Dutch international left-back Erik Pieters from PSV for a fee of \u20ac3.6\u00a0million (\u00a33\u00a0million). Hughes' first match in charge of Stoke on 17 August 2013 ended in a 1\u20130 defeat at Liverpool. Hughes' first win as Stoke manager came in his next match as Stoke beat Crystal Palace 2\u20131 at the Britannia Stadium. This was followed up by a 1\u20130 win away at West Ham. On 2 September 2013, transfer deadline day, Hughes brought in Austrian forward Marko Arnautovi\u0107 from Werder Bremen and Stephen Ireland on loan from Aston Villa.

In August 2002 he went on loan to Manchester City to provide cover for Carlo Nash after injuries to Peter Schmeichel and Nicky Weaver. He stayed with Leicester for one season after their relegation to Division One two years later before retiring as a player. His final appearance for Leicester City was against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux in May 2003. It was the final game of the season, and with Leicester 1\u20130 down, Flowers came on as a late substitute for Ian Walker. Leicester were awarded a late penalty, and despite shouts from the travelling Leicester fans for Flowers to take the penalty, and Flowers himself signalling to the bench, Micky Adams (then Leicester manager) ignored the fans, and allowed Trevor Benjamin to take it, who scored."]}, {"page": "Steve Simonsen", "response": ["In July 2007, Simonsen signed a new contract with Stoke keeping him at the club until June 2010. On the first day of the following season he saved a Steven MacLean penalty in a 1\u20130 win over Cardiff City. He went on to play an important part in Stoke's promotion to the Premier League, although he lost his place in the side towards the end of the campaign, when Carlo Nash was brought in on an emergency loan from Wigan Athletic. Thomas S\u00f8rensen was then signed at the start of the 2008\u201309 season, so Simonsen played second fiddle to the Danish international throughout the year. He played only when S\u00f8rensen was injured, which amounted to just five appearances. The 2009\u201310 season started in the same manner for Simonsen until an injury to S\u00f8rensen at home to Chelsea meant that Simonsen made his first appearance of the season."]}, {"page": "Clitheroe F.C.", "response": ["The last decade of the 20th century saw most of the ten years spent getting the ground up to scratch with \u00a3130,000 being spent in the process.

In all four of the games, the team was made up of loan players from lower division teams in the local area, as well as youth and reserve team players, with Tottenham recording one victory, a 2\u20131 away win at Rudar Velenje. Shortly before his 21st birthday, Day joined Crystal Palace in a deal worth \u00a3225,000.

With Gould out injured for a period of the following season, Lonergan snapped up his goalkeeping gloves and stood between the sticks for the first time in the league against West Brom, two years after his debut. Gould fell out of favour soon after, and Lonergan remained as the first choice until the end of that season. But this was short\u2013lived when Lonergan lost his first team place after breaking his hand, resulting in him being out for six weeks and missing out for the rest of the season. After returning to training in the pre\u2013season, Lonergan returned to the first team as first choice goalkeeper and on 2 October 2004 Lonergan scored a goal from his own penalty area in the 39th minute against Leicester City to equalise, after his long kick bounced over Leicester goalkeeper Kevin Pressman after defender Matt Heath had let the ball bounce. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He remained at Deepdale for the 2004\u201305 season under the watchful eye of new manager Billy Davies, and played a part in 65% of the season before he ruptured his cruciate ligaments before a game against Ipswich Town, due to Lonergan's injury, Carlo Nash was signed as a replacement by Billy Davies from Middlesbrough to shore up the goalkeeping crisis.
