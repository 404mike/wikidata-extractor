See in particular pp. 1\u20132. The classification scheme used was to subdivide the previously used Secchi classes (I to IV) into more specific classes, given letters from A to N. Also, the letter O was used for stars whose spectra consisted mainly of bright lines, the letter P for planetary nebulae, and the letter Q for spectra not fitting into any of the classes A through P.

The analysis was first started by Nettie Farrar, who left a few months later to be married.  This left the problem to the ideas of Henry Draper's niece Antonia Maury (who insisted on a complex classification system) and Williamina Fleming (who was overseeing the project for Pickering, and wanted a much more simple, straightforward approach).  Cannon negotiated a compromise: she started by examining the bright southern hemisphere stars.  To these stars, she applied a third system, a division of stars into the spectral classes O, B, A, F, G, K, M.  Her scheme was based on the strength of the Balmer absorption lines.  After absorption lines were understood in terms of stellar temperatures, her initial classification system was rearranged to avoid having to update star catalogs."]}, {"page": "RR Lyrae variable", "response": ["In surveys of globular clusters, these \"cluster-type\" variables were being rapidly identified in the mid-1890s, especially by E.

Henrietta Swan Leavitt, for example, discovered the so-called period-luminosity relation for Classical Cepheid variable stars, establishing the first major \"standard candle\" with which to measure the distance to galaxies.
