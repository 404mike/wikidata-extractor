He was born in London and died at Maidstone, Kent.\nAs a cricketer, Dyke was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a left-arm medium pace bowler. It was as a bowler that he made an immediate impression in his only first-class match of 1864: he took 10 Marylebone Cricket Club wickets for 41 runs in the game, including 6 for 14 in the second innings. He was unable to repeat this success in four first-class games for Cambridge in 1865: these included the University match against Oxford University in which he took a single wicket and failed to score in either innings. His single game for MCC in 1866 was his most successful with the bat, with a score of 46 in the second innings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dyke (surname)", "response": ["* Edwin Dyke (1842\u20131919), English clergyman and cricketer"]}, {"page": "John Dyke (cricketer)", "response": ["Dyke's brothers, Percyvall and Thomas, and nephew Edwin Dyke, all played first-class cricket, as well as his brother-in-law Herbert Jenner-Fust."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Edwin Dyke (1866) : E.
