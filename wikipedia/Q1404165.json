Inexblicably left out of the 1993 Lions squad that toured New Zealand, Probyn toured South Africa with a World XV in 1989, played for the Lions against France in 1989 and was a member of the Wasps FC side that won the English Courage league in 1990. Along with Stuart Barnes, Wade Dooley, Mike Teague, Peter Winterbottom and Jon Webb, Probyn wore the England shirt for the last time in a 17\u20133 defeat by Ireland at Lansdowne Road in 1993. In total, he won 37 caps for England and scored 3 tries.\nProbyn was fairly slight for a modern international prop, and a good part of his effectiveness can be explained by his unusual physique: his bony shoulders sloped at a sharp angle, he was short in stature and his hips were widely set. In addition, he was able to scrum exceptionally low, making it hard for taller opponents to get any purchase on him at scrum time.\nDue to Probyn's scrummaging techniques some players took to cutting off the sleeves of their shirts as they believed this was how Jeff managed to get so low down in the scrum and would use the sleeves as leverage. After Probyn continued to keep the scrum incredibly low, it was evident that their sleeve cutting was unnecessary.\nAfter retirement from playing, Probyn was a member of Club England, the Rugby Football Union Committee. He was the manager of the England U21 team from 1994 to 1997 during which time he introduced Clive Woodward and Andy Robinson as coaches to representative rugby.  After managing the U21 teams tour of Australia, where they played as a warm up for the first ever Cooke cup game between England and Australia, he returned to the RFU council and sat on the Club England group that elected Woodward as England coach. He sat on the 2006 review that saw the replacement of England's World Cup winning coaches with the current team, led by Martin Johnson.\nAfter leaving the RFU, Probyn was critical of cross-code transfers, such as that of Andy Farrell.He also formed The Front Row Union Club F.R.U.C with fellow international front-row forwards Brian Moore and Paul Rendall.\nProbyn is an Honorary President of Wooden Spoon, the charity of British and Irish rugby.\nProbyn is also a regular on talkSPORT as their expert on Full Contact.\nProbyn is also a regular columnist in The Rugby Paper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 27", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Jeff Probyn, English rugby player, coach, and manager"]}, {"page": "Talksport", "response": ["* September 2011: Talksport broadcast the 2011 Rugby World Cup, with exclusive commentary of all 48 matches in New Zealand.
