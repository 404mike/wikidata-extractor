For the 2000 Air Spectacular she compiled a souvenir programme. She produced a number of videos on the history of flight, with one such video from 1990 being widely shown in schools. Another such production was to mark the 50th anniversary of an RAF crash in Wicklow in 1941. She worked with schools on educational events as part of her role in the Irish Aviation Council regarding \"air education\". She was a researcher and assistant for a wide range of RT\u00c9 radio programmes, with particular interest in aviation history, the most notable of which was the four-part Spreading our wings aired in October 2005 and presented by Gay Byrne. She was a regular contributor to the Sunday miscellany radio, and wrote many letters to newspapers on the topic of aviation. Another series, Home Grown Wings (1998), focused on the Society of Amateur Aircraft Constructors.  She wrote a Masters thesis Flying for the Silver Screen and the Irish Story for an MA in Film Studies. She had a particular interest in the early Irish aviator, Lilian Bland, which led her to founding a project to bring all material relating to Bland together."]}]}}
