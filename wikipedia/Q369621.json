What they proposed is now called social liberalism.Freeden, Michael (1978). The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The New Liberals, including intellectuals like Thomas Hill Green, Leonard Hobhouse and John A. Hobson, saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances. In their view, the poverty, squalor and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.The Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, p. 599.", "* Thomas Hill Green (1836\u20131882)"]}]}}
