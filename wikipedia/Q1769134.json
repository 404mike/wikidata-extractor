Subsequent 1\u20131 draws at home to Celtic \u2013 another televised match in which Francisco Sandaza scored his first goal \u2013 and away to Motherwell produced the first points of the season but a home defeat to Kilmarnock and narrow defeat away to Hibernian left United bottom of the league after five matches. United's third televised match of the season saw them pick up their first league win at Aberdeen and was the first of four successive league victories, preceding home triumphs against Hearts, Inverness CT and St Mirren. The run of victories saw first league goals for summer signings Scott Robertson and Roy O'Donovan, with three clean sheets for goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska. The St Mirren match was played three weeks after the Inverness match following the death of chairman Eddie Thompson, which led to the match against Rangers being postponed. As the St Mirren match was the first match following the death of the chairman, prices were reduced to just \u00a35, prompting over 11,000 fans to attend and pay their respects with a minute's silence. United failed to make it five league wins in a row when they drew 0\u20130 at Falkirk but kept their unbeaten run going with an exciting 3\u20133 draw against Rangers at Ibrox and got back to winning ways with home wins over Aberdeen and Hibernian. A second successive 2\u20130 defeat to Kilmarnock \u2013 this time away from home \u2013 preceded a 1\u20131 draw at home to Hamilton, before wins at St Mirren and Inverness brought United back-to-back away victories for the first time since April 2007.

Less than a week later, United signed a second player from Dundee when Scotland under-21 defender Paul Dixon arrived for around \u00a325,000. Willo Flood returned for a second successive season-long loan when terms were agreed with Cardiff City again on 1 July and Cardiff colleague Warren Feeney followed in a similar deal a week later. Shortly afterwards, Spanish striker Francisco Sandaza arrived on a three-year contract from Valencia Mestalla. In August, Craig Levein's pursuit of Roy O'Donovan ended with a season-long deal for the Sunderland striker, although he was recalled in January, as was Willo Flood, ahead of his transfer to Celtic.
