He made his debut in 3\u20132 victory away over Stoke City on 17 March 2001. On the final day of the same season, Kitson notched his first goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw at Swansea City. The following season saw the club relegated from League One but Kitson scored 10 goals, finishing as the club's second-top goalscorer, one behind Tom Youngs. It was in the 2002\u201303 campaign that Kitson really found his feet. He scored 25 goals in a prolific campaign which saw him hot on the heels of David Crown's club record of 27 goals in a season. After 11 goals in 19 appearances at the start of the 2003\u201304 season, Kitson left Cambridge to join second-tier outfit Reading. His return of 47 goals in 123 appearances in all competitions ensured Kitson's place among the club's all-time legends."]}, {"page": "Chris Kamara", "response": ["He was re-signed to Portsmouth by Frank Burrows, who had previously coached Kamara at Swindon. However, in October 1981 he was again transferred after Brentford manager Fred Callaghan agreed to a swap deal with David Crown going the other way. Kamara was paired with Terry Hurlock in a highly committed central midfield partnership at Griffin Park. He settled in well during the 1981\u201382 campaign and scored a career best of 11 goals in the 1982\u201383 season as Brentford posted two top ten finishes. The club then struggled to just one place above the Third Division relegation zone in 1983\u201384 before rising to 13th place in 1984\u201385. He won a Football League Trophy runners-up medal in 1985, playing at Wembley in a 3\u20131 defeat by Wigan Athletic. He took the decision to leave the club in summer 1985 after he rejected manager Frank McLintock's offer of a new one-year contract on the same terms."]}, {"page": "Steve Tilson", "response": ["In 1999, Tilson returned to Southend United as Director of the club's new centre of excellence, the establishment of which was made possible by a grant of \u00a3276,000 from the English Sports Council. The post, which enabled him to continue his playing career with Canvey Island, saw him responsible for overseeing and developing all of the centre's teams, raging from the under-9 to 16. Following the departure of David Webb as Southend United's manager in October 2001 and the promotion of Rob Newman from reserve team manager to first team manager, Tilson's role widened to take on Newman's previous duties with the reserve team. In May 2002, he drew time on his five-year career with Canvey Island to join Newman's backroom team on a full-time basis becoming joint assistant manager with Blues' former striker David Crown."]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 in English football", "response": ["* David Crown (Southend United) \u2013 26 goals"]}]}}
