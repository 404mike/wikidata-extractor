He was a Member of Parliament (MP)  for Tralee from January 1807 to May of the same year.\nThe Boddington family held large estates in the West Indies and Samuel had been left a fortune by his father who had been a director of the South Sea Company as well as a West India merchant with offices at Mark Lane.\nIn 1792 Samuel fell in love with a penniless orphan, Grace Ashburner, and in 1792 they were married. But Grace soon tired of her husband's quiet intellectual interests (Henry Fox rather unkindly referred to Samuel Boddington as \"the arch-bore old Bod.\") and eventually she eloped with his cousin Benjamin Boddington who had recently joined the family firm. Thereafter, Samuel approached his friend, Richard Sharp (politician), a fellow Dissenter, fellow member of the Fishmongers' Company, and both mutual friends of Samuel Rogers, asking if he would join him in business, and eventually a West India company of Boddington, Sharp and Philips (Sir George Philips, 1st Baronet) was established at 17 Mark Lane. Both Boddington and Philips (later Sir George Philips) followed Sharp's example and became dissenting Whig members of Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tralee (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Samuel Boddington"]}, {"page": "Richard Sharp (politician)", "response": ["In 1798 Sharp finally left the hatting business, which came to an end when the other partner, his stepfather Davis, died two years later. In response to an invitation from a friend, Samuel Boddington, another Dissenter, he now took up a partnership in the latter's West India merchant's firm. A third partner was Sir George Philips (later Sir George Philips). This new enterprise with a potential of great profits must have opened the door to the considerable wealth that Sharp was able to accumulate. However, it must have tested the depth of his anti-slavery sympathies, as the entire West India trade was based on the use of plantation slaves."]}, {"page": "Members of the 3rd UK Parliament from Ireland", "response": ["| Samuel Boddington"]}, {"page": "Sir George Philips, 1st Baronet", "response": ["George attended several schools, including Stand Grammar School.
