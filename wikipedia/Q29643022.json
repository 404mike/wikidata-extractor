This work led to future post-war pioneering research in lung physiology, the effect of asbestos on the lungs and lung diseases including emphysema.\nBetween 1952 and 1955, he took up a senior lecturer post at the then new University College of the West Indies and was the first to use the terminology of diabetes types 1, 2, and J in his 1955 paper for The Lancet titled \"Diabetes in Jamaica\".\nUpon return to the UK, he became a consultant at the Hammersmith Hospital, London, where he continued MRC research on lung gas analysis using a newly modified mass spectrometer. Later, he would go on to King's College Hospital, where he continued research on lung diseases and set up a chest unit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Morrell", "response": ["His extramarital affairs produced several children who were cared for by his wife, who also struggled to conceal evidence of his mental instability.

In 1950, R. D. Lawrence observed that some diabetics were deficient in insulin and that some were not. Philip Hugh-Jones, while working in Jamaica in 1955, clarified Lawrence\u2019s classification and coined the terms \"type 1\" and \"type 2\" diabetes. He also noted a rarer variety observed in insulin-resistant youth (whose condition could not be placed into the two types). He called this third group \"type J\", where J stood for Jamaica."]}, {"page": "Andrew Cudworth", "response": ["Recognising the difference between juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes and mature-onset, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, Cudworth began using the terminology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in 1976. The classification of diabetes into type 1 and type 2 was first used by Philip Hugh-Jones in a 1955 paper, but the terminology was revived and popularised by Cudworth. This remains the common terminology to differentiate the two forms of diabetes mellitus. Previously, the classification of diabetes was based on the age of onset \u2013 either juvenile or mature \u2013 whereas Cudworth's classification system was based on genetics."]}, {"page": "P.

He earned a British Thoracic Association Research Fellowship at King's College Hospital, London with Philip Hugh-Jones. He was a pulmonary fellow in the Division of Pulmonary Medicine at the University of Miami from 1980 to 1982, and then served as a critical care fellow at the University of Pittsburgh. He joined the faculty at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in 1990. The following year he became Professor of Medicine and Anesthesiology at Loyola University Chicago."]}]}}
