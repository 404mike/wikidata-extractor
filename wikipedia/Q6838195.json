Under their guidance, Reading finished second in the First Division but was left to battle for a place in the Premier League through the playoffs, as the Premier League was being reduced in size from 22 teams to 20. Reading were beaten 4-3 by Bolton Wanderers in the playoff final at Wembley.\nGooding and Quinn remained in charge at Elm Park for two seasons afterward, until they were replaced by Terry Bullivant after failing to mount any further promotion challenges.\nAfter Reading, Gooding had a short spell at Southend United, before retiring from football. He remained at Roots Hall for a while as a coach.\nHe has since carved himself a career as a radio commentary pundit, performing such roles as co-commentator for BBC Radio Berkshire's coverage of Reading's league matches, while also working as an estate agent in Tadley.\nDespite playing 701 league games in a career stretching 20 years, Gooding never played top-division football \u2013 the closest he came to reaching the top flight was with Reading when they narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League in 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reading F.C.", "response": ["The appointment of Mark McGhee as player-manager, shortly after the takeover by John Madejski, in 1991 saw Reading move forward.
