In the Queen's Birthday Honours of 21 April 2010, the company was awarded two Queen's Awards for Enterprise \u2013 in the Innovation and International Trade categories. [1]\nBrompton has now produced well over 100,000 bicycles and in 2008 achieved 25,000 units for export to markets such as the Netherlands, America, Germany, Japan and Scandinavia. A Cambridge engineering graduate, Ritchie was working as a landscape gardener in London when, in 1976, he conceived the idea for a folding bike, which he subsequently named after the Brompton Oratory. His design won the 'Best Product' award against an international field at the Cyclex exhibition in April 1987. After devoting his life to the development and manufacture of the bike, he began to step back from the day-to-day running of the company in 2005, reduced his shareholding, and now acts as Technical Director.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brompton Bicycle", "response": ["The Brompton folding bicycle and accessories are the company's core product, noted for its self-supporting compact size when stored.  All available models of the folding bicycle are based on the same hinged frame and 16-inch (35\u00d7349\u00a0mm) tyre size.  Components are added, removed, or replaced by titanium parts to form the many variations.  The modular design has remained fundamentally unchanged since the original patent was filed by Andrew Ritchie in 1979, with small details being refined by continual improvement. Ritchie was awarded the 2009 Prince Philip Designers Prize for work on the bicycle.", "In 1976 Andrew Ritchie founded the company, named after the Brompton Oratory, a landmark visible from his bedroom workshop where the first prototypes were built.  At the time he was working as a gardener.  Ritchie obtained backing from friends and sought to license the design, but after five years began manufacturing the bicycle design himself. Production ground to a halt in 1982 after which Ritchie continued to explore possibilities for continued manufacturing whilst undertaking other jobs.", "* Andrew Ritchie, Brompton history, lecture recording (video: 21 minutes)"]}, {"page": "Andrew Ritchie", "response": ["Andrew Ritchie may refer to:", "* Andrew Ritchie (art historian) (1907\u20131978), Scottish-born American art historian", "* Andrew Ritchie (Brompton) (born 1947), founder of Brompton Bicycle Ltd", "* Andrew Ritchie (British Army officer) (born 1953), director of Goodenough College, former Commandant of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst", "* Andrew Ritchie, cycling historian associated with Major Taylor", "* Andrew Ritchie (priest) (1880\u20131956), Anglican priest"]}, {"page": "Bickerton (bicycle)", "response": ["The Bickerton, also called the Bickerton Portable, is a portable aluminium folding bicycle designed by Harry Bickerton and manufactured in the UK between 1971 and 1989.

The Bickerton was a portable bicycle launched when folding bicycles tended to be  step-through frames with a simple hinge, such as the folding variant of the Raleigh Twenty. The bicycle was made entirely of aluminium profiles, without any welds. In its weight (under 10\u00a0kg) and folded package size it broke new ground and it is cited by Andrew Ritchie as one of his inspirations in creating the highly successful Brompton bicycle."]}, {"page": "Prince Philip Designers Prize", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Richtie, Andrew\"|Andrew Ritchie"]}, {"page": "Andrew Ritchie (Brompton founder)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Ritchie (Brompton)"]}, {"page": "List of English inventors and designers", "response": ["*Andrew Ritchie (1947\u2013 ), Brompton bicycle"]}, {"page": "Harry Bickerton", "response": ["Harry Bickerton's bicycle design became equally seminal as Alex Moulton's, and eventually inspired Andrew Ritchie to create the Brompton bicycle."]}]}}
