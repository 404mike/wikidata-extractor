During his time at Sunderland, from 1920 to 1927, he made 192 league appearances and scored 32 goals. He linked up well with Charlie Buchan for whom he created many goals from the left wing. He went on to play for Birmingham, Lincoln City and York City, and died in Sunderland in 1939 at the age of 44.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Ellis", "response": ["*Billy Ellis (1895\u20131939), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wolverhampton", "response": ["* Billy Ellis (1895\u20131939) \u2013 footballer, played in the Football League for Sunderland, Birmingham, Lincoln City and York City as a winger"]}, {"page": "Arthur Johnson (footballer, born 1903)", "response": ["Johnson was born in Atherstone, Warwickshire. He began his football career with home-town club Atherstone Town, and joined Football League champions Huddersfield Town in November 1924, but moved on to Barnsley a year later without appearing for the first team. After 20 games in 18 months for Barnsley, Johnson, an outside left, returned to the Midlands with Birmingham. He played a run of games in the early part of the 1927\u201328 season, but his performances on the field failed to live up to those on the training ground. He lost his place to Billy Ellis, and moved on to Bristol City at the end of the season.Matthews, p.170. Johnson played 62 games in all competitions for Bristol City before returning nearer home once more to finish off his career at Coventry City."]}, {"page": "Wilf Threlfall", "response": ["It will be rather surprising if Sunderland overlook the claims of Billy Ellis and George Death for their outside left position, but the prospects are that a newcomer in Wilfred Threlfall will have done duty this afternoon. Wilf is a youngster who did extremely well with the Morecambe club last season, and was signed up by the Roker Park club as a soon as the old campaign ended. His form in trial matches has been startling.", "Threlfall made his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on the opening day of the 1927\u201328 season, and he and Arthur Johnson shared the outside left position for the next couple of months.Matthews, pp. 101, 170. In November 1927, Birmingham signed Billy Ellis, the same winger who had kept Threlfall out of the Sunderland team, and both Threlfall and Johnson moved on at the end of the season without playing again. After only three appearances for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic in the Third Division South, Threlfall returned home to non-league football with Morecambe and later with Lancaster Town."]}]}}
