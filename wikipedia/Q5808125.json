When it opened in 1921 it was the first parasite biology institute to be established. Between 1947 and 1964 the MRC (Medical Research Council) Chemotherapy Research Unit was based in 'the Molteno', but research into parasitology continued alongside. Later, between 1968 and 1987, 'the Molteno' became fully occupied by the MRC as their Biochemical Parasitology Unit and totally dedicated to research into parasitology, although the building was still rented from the University of Cambridge. In September 1987 it became part of the University of Cambridge's Pathology Department. Notable workers include Ann Bishop, Douglas Mackay Henderson, David Keilin, Thaddeus Mann and Brun\u00f3 Ferenc Straub."]}, {"page": "Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh", "response": ["*Douglas Mackay Henderson (1970-1987)"]}, {"page": "D.M.Hend.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Douglas Mackay Henderson"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Wilson (botanist)", "response": ["His students included Dr Mary Noble (1911-2002)Scotsman (newspaper) obituary of Mary Noble 8 August 2002 and Douglas Mackay Henderson.", "*British Rust Fungi (completed and published by Douglas Mackay Henderson in 1966)"]}]}}
