He was the father of cricketer Bob Herman.\nHerman was a tall right arm paceman who bowled in-swingers. He took over 100 wickets in a county season on five occasions with his best effort coming in 1937 when he managed 142 wickets at 22.07.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["From 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 fours and three sixes. After World War II, Derek Shackleton became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by Victor Cannings, but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and Peter Sainsbury around 100, with Roy Marshall was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Hampshire, a very ordinary side who bowled badly, were captained by Desmond Eagar. The batting was occasionally good and top of the county's averages was wicketkeeper Neil McCorkell who scored 1,539 championship runs and claimed 49 victims. Neville Rogers and Johnny Arnold played some good innings to both comfortably exceed 1,000 runs. Eagar and Gerry Hill both reached 1,000 with low averages and the all-rounder Jim Bailey, who took 53 wickets, fell just short of 1,000 runs. Playfair considered \"the steady and loyal George Heath\" to be the best of the bowlers who included Bailey, Hill, Victor Ransom, Lofty Herman and the injury-plagued Charles Knott. Other players included Gilbert Dawson, Thomas Dean, Arthur Holt, Alan Shirreff and future stalwart Leo Harrison.Playfair, pp. 110\u2013111."]}, {"page": "Bob Herman (cricketer)", "response": ["His father, Lofty Herman, also played for Hampshire."]}, {"page": "Lofty", "response": ["* Lofty Herman (1907\u20131987), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club first-class cricket records", "response": ["|Lofty Herman|||| 1,041"]}, {"page": "Trevor Grant (cricketer)", "response": ["Grant made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Hampshire at Dean Park, Bournemouth in the 1946 County Championship.  In Sussex's first-innings, he was dismissed for a duck by Lofty Herman. In their second-innings, he was dismissed for 6 runs by the same bowler.  This was his only major appearance for Sussex."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Their outstanding player was the prolific run-scorer Phil Mead and other good batsmen were George Brown and Johnny Arnold. The best bowlers were Alec Kennedy, Jack Newman and Lofty Herman. Behind the stumps, Hampshire were well served by Walter Livsey, Neil McCorkell and, when required, by Brown too."]}]}}
