However, the argument that 'the music industry is meaner' fell apart this week. [...] I refuse to believe that anyone in the music industry has even been given a contract, told they're brilliant and then forced to watch 15 other people sing and have that contract ripped up in front of their faces. And even if they have, I bet they didn't have an audience of 4,000 people chanting at them to be on their way. This was reality TV at its most cruel.\" He wondered if the change was a \"desperate attempt to create interest in a series that has performed solidly in the ratings, but without creating any real talking points or memorable moments\", and said that \"watching Karen Harding, Lydia Lucy and Sheena McHugh get put into the Top 6 and then have the dream of a spot at Judges' Houses snatched away from them felt needlessly mean. Whether the trio deserved to make Judges' Houses or not felt irrelevant. The audience finger-pointing and the chanting of 'Swap! Swap! Swap!' made the whole process terribly ugly.\" He questioned the show's producers' \"need to make it even more vicious\", opined that the new twist \"definitely undermines the credibility of the show's judges\", and said, \"The whole twist felt contrived and unpleasant, and I hope it won't be returning in 2014.\""]}, {"page": "The Playlist", "response": ["|Kara Marni, Karen Harding & Boy Pablo"]}, {"page": "Giorgio Moroder discography", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"| \"Good for Me\"(featuring Karen Harding)"]}, {"page": "Le Youth", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"| \"Stay\" (featuring Karen Harding)"]}, {"page": "Daniel Davidsen", "response": ["| Karen Harding, Chelcee Grimes, Peter Wallevik, Mich Hansen"]}, {"page": "Today (production duo)", "response": ["**\"Gunshy\" (feat.
