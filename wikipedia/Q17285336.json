In their third heat, both Collins and Gachet were cut up before the first bend, Gachet's wheel being struck and, in holding his machine steady, the young Eagle found himself at the back. As he managed to pass Collins, his bike reared on the notorious second bend of Plough Lane and both he and Collins fell. Gachet was carried off and, in the re-run, Collins scored 3 points.\nCollins went out in the final heat needing only 1 point for a run-off and 2 for the Crown. Lying second behind Les Rumsey, he fell on the third lap, remounted, but was too far behind to catch up.
