He scored his first goal for the \"Valiants\" with a 25-yard volley in a 4\u20130 win over Wigan Athletic at Springfield Park on 17 April. Four days later he scored the only goal of the game in the Football League Trophy southern area final second leg match with Exeter City at St James Park to secure Vale a place in the final. He also scored on the final day of the season to help turn round a half-time 2\u20131 deficit to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road into a 4\u20132 win; however they ended the season in third-place, one point behind promoted Bolton Wanderers, and so entered the play-offs. He went on to provid the cross for Martin Foyle to score the winning goal past Stockport County in the play-off semi-finals. Stockport County were also Vale's opponents in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley on 22 May, and Slaven managed to set up Paul Kerr for Vale's first goal before scoring the second decisive goal of a 2\u20131 victory. Ironically it was Sky TV's match summariser, Lennie Lawrence, who was tasked with naming Slaven as the man of the match just two months after letting him go on a free transfer.
