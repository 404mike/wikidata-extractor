He is known for his rural landscapes of his native Berkshire and for his Genre paintings of children and animals. Gore was in the tradition of late Victorian Romanticism and Naturalism that flourished in the period before the turn of the Twentieth Century but which quickly became unfashionable in the aftermath of the Great War and the social and political changes that followed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newbury, Berkshire", "response": ["* William Henry Gore (1857\u20131942) \u2013 painter of the Berkshire countryside, born and died in Newbury."]}, {"page": "City and Guilds of London Art School", "response": ["* William Henry Gore (1877)"]}, {"page": "Edward Stott", "response": ["Many Victorians possessed a somewhat sentimentalised view of childhood and Genre paintings of children such as those produced by William Henry Gore and Blanche Jenkins amongst numerous others were immensely popular.Brian Stewart & Mervyn Cutten, (1997), The Dictionary of Portrait Painters in Britain up to 1920, Antique Collectors' Club.  Stott had commercial and international critical success with a number of his paintings depicting children at play. They possess a tenderness that suggests an affinity with children. The Old Gate (1895) was chosen for a major art exhibition in Munich. It shows a boy and a team of plough horses returning home on a late summer's evening where they are welcomed by two young girls bathed in the shadows of a late evening sun. Stott presents a painting in tune with the sensibilities of his audience that rural life was stable and permanent and built on rituals of hard work. The painting which is now owned by the Manchester Art Gallery was subsequently shown at the Brussels Exposition in 1897 and at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900, possibly at the request of Stott's friend and patron Isidore Spielmann."]}]}}
