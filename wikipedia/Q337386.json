The retaliation was to take the form of threats to impose duties in response to goods from that country. Liberal unionists had split from the liberals, who advocated free trade, and this speech marked a turning point in the group's slide toward protectionism. Landsdowne argued that the threat of retaliatory tariffs was similar to gaining respect in a room of gunmen by pointing a big gun (his exact words were \"a gun a little bigger than everyone else's\"). The \"Big Revolver\" became a slogan of the time, often used in speeches and cartoons."]}, {"page": "Liberal Unionist Party", "response": ["*Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne 1903\u20131912"]}]}}
