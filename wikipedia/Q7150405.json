(born 26 November 1947) is a former English cricketer who is currently a barrister. \nDunkels was a left-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born in Marylebone, London and was educated at Harrow School, where he represented the school cricket team. Standing 6 ft 10in, Dunkels was one of the tallest first-class cricketers of all time. Dunkels first played county cricket for Devon in the 1969 Minor Counties Championship against the Somerset Second XI. He played Minor counties cricket for Devon from 1969 to 1975, playing 29 matches for the county. He additionally played for three first-class teams, playing a single first-class match for each one. His first-class debut came for Warwickshire in 1971 against the touring Indians. His second first-class match came in the same season for a combined Minor Counties team against the same opposition. The following season he played his third and final first-class match, this time for Sussex against Cambridge University. Despite his remarkable height, Dunkels was not a bowler who could bowl with great pace or generate steepling bounce, instead bowling medium pace. His three first-class matches yielded three wickets at an expensive bowling average of 84.33, with all three of his wickets coming for Sussex.He was called to the bar in 1972, and appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1993.
