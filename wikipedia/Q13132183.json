She was involved in the production of The Telegoons by making marionette figures and created the character Zippy for the children's television show Rainbow in 1972 but left production after one series because of a back injury. She toured the United Kingdom giving performances until she stopped in 2009 after being afflicted with dementia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rainbow (TV series)", "response": ["For the first two seasons of Rainbow, the show was presented by David Cook, who lived in the Rainbow House with Bungle the Bear, played by John Leeson. Each episode (most of which were written by John Kershaw) would focus on a particular educational subject, for instance, shapes, houses, or animals of some kind, and would involve Bungle inquisitively asking David about that subject, and David educating him about it. Real-world footage of the episode's subject would usually be shown, over which David and Bungle would comment. The character of Zippy (voiced by Peter Hawkins and operated by Violet Philpott), a tangerine oval-headed puppet with a zip for a mouth, would occasionally appear outside the window and provide most of the comedy, by adding his own input. As a 'know-it-all', Zippy would boast about his superior knowledge of the episode's subject, which would lead to humorous banter and squabbling between him and Bungle, who would occasionally zip up Zippy's mouth to stop him boasting. Each episode featured a song from the group Telltale about that episode's subject; Telltale also performed the show's theme tune which would be used for the entirety of its run. The scenes in the Rainbow House would also be interspersed with animations, as well as short sketches featuring the puppet characters of Sunshine and Moony (both operated and voiced by Violet Philpott), stories from the Rainbow book, usually read by a guest star, occasionally taking the form of stop-motion animations, and occasionally scenes involving different puppet characters. Most episodes ended with David showing the viewer how to make a particular item at home using paper or cardboard, again relating to that episode's theme.", "Episode 18, 'Cats and Dogs' introduced an additional puppet character - Duffy the Dog, a white sheepdog who was friends with Zippy and would occasionally pop up at his side outside the window. Again, Duffy was both operated and voiced by Violet Philpott.", "*Zippy \u2013 loud and domineering, but usually very funny (albeit not to the other characters in the show). The puppet was originally voiced by Peter Hawkins and operated by Violet Philpott and later voiced by Roy Skelton \u2013 both voice artists were also well known for voicing Daleks and Cybermen in Doctor Who \u2013 and operated by Ronnie Le Drew who later voiced him after Skelton. Zippy's mouth is a zip, and when he became too bossy or irritating, this was zipped shut to prevent him from continuing: on at least one occasion he unzipped himself, though he appears unable to do so on other occasions. He broadly represented childhood self-centeredness, \"naughtiness\" and extroversion. Zippy was extremely boastful and would frequently brag about his superior intelligence and singing skill (both of which proved to be completely unfounded when put to the test) and was also greedy, often overeating and displaying a particular love for chocolate and sweets."]}, {"page": "Zippy (Rainbow)", "response": ["Zippy is a fictional character on the British children's television programme Rainbow. Zippy is a light-orange (\"tangerine\") puppet of ambiguous species with a rugby-ball-shaped oval head, blue eyes and a zip for a mouth, hence his name. His voice was first provided by Peter Hawkins and later by Roy Skelton and Ronnie Le Drew.  Violet Philpott was first to operate the character in 1972 before Le Drew took over the role in 1973.
