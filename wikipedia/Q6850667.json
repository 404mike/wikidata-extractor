Ziauddin Sardar makes the point, classifying abortion clinic violence as Christian terrorism. Andrew Sullivan makes the point, singling out anti-abortion violence as Christian terrorism. Aref M. Al-Khattar makes the point, writing about the USA: \"Many Christian organizations rely on their special interpretation of the Bible in committing violent (terrorist) acts. These include anti-Semitic attacks, anti-abortion acts, and violent anti-black movements.\" Jennifer Jefferis makes the point, connecting all American anto-abortion terrorism to Christian extremism stemming from 1981's A Christian Manifesto. Professor Muhammad Arif Zakaullah makes the point that Christian fundamenalists make up the Christian terrorists who use violence against abortion providers. Patricia Baird-Windle and Eleanor J. Bader make the point in their scholarly book Targets of hatred: anti-abortion terrorism: they write that American anti-abortion sentiment is specifically based on interpretations of Biblical law and historical Christian theology. The authors write that Americans are hard-pressed to accept that Christianity is the root of this violence, they write about media coverage, \"Then, still unable to accept the fact that an allegedly Christian political movement had turned deadly, they began to focus on the pathology of individual fanatics. Repeatedly we were told that the killings were 'isolated incidents'...\" The authors continue proving that American anti-abortion terrorism is Christian extremism. Milan Rai, Loretta Hall, Anan Ameri, and Bridget K. Hall all make the same point, that Westerners are unable to admit that Christian extremism is the root of all anti-abortion terrorism, though it is.
