Wolstenholme (born c. 1954, Preston, Lancashire) is an English former football referee who officiated in the Football League and the Premier League. He now lives in Blackburn, Lancashire, and may be remembered as the referee in charge of a football match in 2002 described as the \"Battle of Bramall Lane\". His other occupation before becoming a professional for PGMOL in 2001 was as an engineering fitter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Bramall Lane", "response": ["United goalkeeper Simon Tracey was sent off in the 9th minute for deliberately handling the ball outside the area to stop a shot at goal. Albion striker Scott Dobie gave his side the lead going into half-time, and midfielder Derek McInnes doubled the lead in the 63rd minute, prompting United manager Neil Warnock to make two substitutions; Santos and Patrick Suffo came on, but both received red cards within moments. Santos committed a dangerous two-footed tackle on Johnson, and Suffo headbutted McInnes in the ensuing melee. Down to eight men, United conceded a third goal, with Dobie scoring his second of the afternoon. United midfielder Michael Brown and defender Robert Ullathorne suffered injuries that meant they could no longer take part in the match. Because United had already used all of their allowed substitutions, referee Eddie Wolstenholme, who had already declined to send off both Brown and captain Keith Curle for clear red-card offences, was forced to abandon the match in the 82nd minute, as dictated by the rules of the game.", "Nine minutes into the match, United goalkeeper Simon Tracey was sent off by referee Eddie Wolstenholme for deliberately handling the ball outside the penalty area and denying Albion an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock sent on the substitute keeper, Wilko de Vogt, in place of striker Peter Ndlovu. Albion defender L\u00e1rus Sigur\u00f0sson received a yellow card shortly after. Albion opened the scoring in the 18th minute, when striker Scott Dobie headed in a cross from Andy Johnson.", "Football League spokesman John Nagle released a statement saying, \"The Football League have the authority to allow the result to stand, or to order the game to be replayed\", and confirmed there would be a meeting the following Thursday to discuss the matter. Writing for the BBC, journalist Phil McNulty said he believed Neil Warnock and Sheffield United should face heavy punishment, and argued for a points deduction. Warnock, though, echoed Megson's comments, saying, \"there is no place for that in any game of football, let alone a professional match\", but joked that he'd \"have brought a deckchair out on the pitch to keep one of [the injured players] on\" had he known the match would be called off. In the changing room, Megson told Moore that if a replay was necessary, he would bring Albion's youth team. Speaking to the Lancashire Telegraph, referee Eddie Wolstenholme said he was correct in sending off all three of the United players, and knew immediately that, once Ullathorne was leaving the field due to injury, he would be forced to abandon the match.", "The Broken Metatarsal podcast episode featuring Eddie Wolstenholme interview"]}, {"page": "Wolstenholme", "response": ["*Eddie Wolstenholme (born c. 1954), English football referee"]}, {"page": "Graham Laws", "response": ["He has been fourth official for Eddie Wolstenholme twice in big games, firstly for the FA Vase Final at Villa Park on 6 May 2001,Fourth official, FA Vase Final, 2001: soccerbase.com website.

Kevin Phillips then scored his 35th goal of the season to put Sunderland ahead but Mendonca doubled his own tally with fewer than twenty minutes remaining.  Quinn restored Sunderland's lead two minutes later, before a Richard Rufus header for Charlton five minutes from the end of regular time made the score 3\u20133, and sent the game into extra time. Nicky Summerbee then gave Sunderland the lead for the third time before Mendonca completed his hat-trick, the first player to do so in a play-off final.  Extra time ended 4\u20134, so the game was determined by a penalty shootout.  Both teams scored their first five spot-kicks before the shootout moved to 'sudden death'. Michael Gray stepped forward to take Sunderland's seventh penalty, but his weak strike was saved by the Charlton goalkeeper Sa\u0161a Ili\u0107 and Charlton won 7\u20136 on penalties.", "For Sunderland, Quinn had recovered from a recurring hamstring injury he aggravated in the second leg of the play-off semi-final against Sheffield United, while Phillips was also fit after suffering a thigh strain in the same match. Charlton's Robinson was selected on the bench having not played for eight weeks following a hairline fracture of his right leg.  The referee for the match was Eddie Wolstenholme;  he had officiated the second leg of the semi-final between Ipswich and Charlton.  It was reported in the press that the match was worth \u00a35\u201310million, and later by Deloitte to be worth up to \u00a320million, to the winning team from television revenue.  The match was broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports.  Charlton wore their traditional red and white kit while Sunderland were in an away strip of old gold and dark blue."]}]}}
