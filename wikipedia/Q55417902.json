In 1946, Dr Robert L.

Marshall was responsible for creating an urtext edition of the cantata for B\u00e4renreiter in 1985. His preparation started in 1972, using the rare opportunity to have the autograph manuscript of Bach's full score available, created by Bach as a \"composing score\". Marshall attempted to reverse the process, analysing how Bach might have set about composing movements, altering portions if required. For the last chorale, where the strings accompany the chorus and other instruments colla parte, the two last pages of the autograph score reveal the many modifications Bach made. Throughout the cantata, Bach's use of \"word painting\" is prevalent, but in the final chorale it is particularly imaginative.

The series of accompanying pamphlets were subsequently collated into an eponymous book published in 1944. The educationalist Robert L. Marshall was the general editor of the series. The booklets were also used by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force."]}]}}
