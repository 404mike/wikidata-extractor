He is also the son of the Nobel Prize winner Max Perutz. \nPerutz's research spans inorganic chemistry, photochemistry and catalysis. In particular his interests lie in the mechanistic details of homogeneous catalysis by transition metal complexes, and is responsible for many techniques used in the field that have enabled chemists to take a different approach to fundamental reactions and many industrial processes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Max Perutz", "response": ["He was cremated on 12 February 2002 at Cambridge Crematorium (Cambridgeshire) and his ashes interred with his parents Hugo Perutz and Dely Perutz in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.E-mails from Robin Perutz and Vivien Perutz to Martin Packer, August 2012 His wife was cremated on 28 December 2005 and her ashes were interred in the same grave."]}, {"page": "Perutz", "response": ["*Robin Perutz, son of Max, chemist"]}, {"page": "Tilden Prize", "response": ["* 1992 \u2013 , Philip Kocienski, Robin Perutz"]}]}}
