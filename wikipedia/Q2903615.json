It is true that none of the cricketers with large career totals played before 1864 (Webber's main reason for adopting that date) and so his startpoint was not really an issue in that context. It does, however, exclude numerous leading players and it impacts other cricket records. If first-class cricket did not begin until 1864, then legendary cricketers like Richard Newland, John Small, William Beldham, Alfred Mynn and William Caffyn were not \"first-class players\". Among records, the lowest known team score occurred in the 1810 match between All-England and The Bs (with Wells and Lawrell) when The Bs were dismissed for 6 in their second innings; and that match is not regarded as first-class by those statisticians who still use 1815 or 1864 as their statistical startpoint. The real significance of 1864 was the legalisation of overarm bowling but there is also evidence of a more structured approach to inter-county cricket which ultimately brought about the introduction of the official County Championship. 1864 was also the first year in which Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was published and this is seen as the key source for cricket records, although there are plenty of earlier sources."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1861\u201362", "response": ["The team was captained by H.
