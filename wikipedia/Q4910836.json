The majority of the album was produced by the Wave Team, who had produced most of Numan's previous offering, The Fury, and continued in a style similar to the previous album (with liberal use of saxophone and female backing vocals). However, the album's stand-out tracks, \"My Breathing\" and \"New Thing from London Town\", were produced by Ade Orange and Bill Sharpe and Nick Smith, respectively, and offer a departure from the industrial sound of the rest of the album into quite different atmospheres. \"New Thing from London Town\" was a re-recorded version of the single released by Numan and Bill Sharpe (under the name Sharpe + Numan) a month before the release of Strange Charm. The Strange Charm version of the song retains the original music, but features new lyrics written and sung by Numan (the lyrics on the single version were written by Roger Odell).

Outland could almost be described as a concept album, as its songs share common themes and (in the case of the tracks \"Confession\" and \"From Russia Infected\") common musical and lyrical motifs. Indeed, Outland features more overt references to science-fiction than any other album Numan has released. The album features many vocal samples from notable sci-fi/action movies of the 1980s, including Blade Runner, The Terminator, Aliens and Predator (the title of Outland itself may be a reference to the 1981 science fiction film of the same name).
