Henry Thackeray was a scholar of King's College, University of Cambridge, who is perhaps best remembered for his work on Josephus. His untimely death at the age of sixty-one in 1930 abruptly ended his work as editor and translator of Josephus's works for the Loeb Classical Library, after producing the first five books and part of the sixth of the Antiquities. The work was then carried on by the American scholar, Ralph Marcus.\nHis works included\n\nThe Relation of St. Paul to Contemporary Jewish Thought 1900\nThe Letter of Aristeas 1904\nJosephus: The Man and the Historian 1929\nAn Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek with Henry Barclay Swete 1900\nA grammar of the Old Testament in Greek according to the Septuagint 1909A son was the astronomer A.

Henry St. John Thackeray used Niese's version for the Loeb Classical Library edition widely used today.", "The standard editio maior of the various Greek manuscripts is that of Benedictus Niese, published 1885\u201395. The text of Antiquities is damaged in some places. In the Life, Niese follows mainly manuscript P, but refers also to AMW and R. Henry St. John Thackeray for the Loeb Classical Library has a Greek text also mainly dependent on P. Andr\u00e9 Pelletier edited a new Greek text for his translation of Life. The ongoing M\u00fcnsteraner Josephus-Ausgabe of M\u00fcnster University will provide a new critical apparatus. There also exist late Old Slavonic translations of the Greek, but these contain a large number of Christian interpolations."]}, {"page": "Thackeray (surname)", "response": ["*Henry St. John Thackeray (1869\u20131930), British scholar at King's College, Cambridge, an expert on Josephus and the Septuagint"]}, {"page": "Antiquities of the Jews", "response": ["One of the best known translations of this work was provided by William Whiston in 1737, which has been in print continuously since then.A new updated version of Whiston's translation was published by Hendrickson Publishers in 1987.
