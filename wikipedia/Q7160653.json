Bob Monkhouse wrote in his memoirs that when he saw the film in the cinema he thought it was \"really bad\" but was impressed by Dors. \"It was her energy that at first attracted me\", he wrote. \"Her acting was raw but promising and her vitality made me remember her afterwards as if her part of the screen had been in colour.\"", "Rank promoted Dors to leading roles in 1949's Diamond City, the story of a boom town in South Africa in 1870. Jean Kent was originally cast as a saloon owner in love with hero David Farrar, who loves a missionary played by Honor Blackman; Kent turned down the role and Dors took over. Filming took place in late 1948 and early 1949 when Dors  was only seventeen years old. She was paid \u00a330 a week. She says the part of \"Diana\" in The Blue Lamp was written for her but she lost it to Peggy Evans when the director decided he wanted \"a waif type\"; she also tested for the female lead in The Cure for Love but lost out to Dora Bryan.Dors 1960 p 27"]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Peggy Evans, actress (died 2015)"]}, {"page": "List of female movie actors by name: E\u2013F", "response": ["*Peggy Evans (1925\u20132015)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Peggy Evans (1921\u20132015), British actress"]}, {"page": "Michael Howard (comedian)", "response": ["He married Betty Kelly in 1938, with whom he had one child, Harriet.
