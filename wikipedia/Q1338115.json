Mina speaks with an unknown foreign accent, which vanishes gradually in the second season since the episode Dodo Butterfly, and spends time experimenting and making inventions at home as a scientific and curious character. These inventions, combined with her knowledge, frequently help the group, so Mina is a source of help when the others face adversity in their adventures. Mini Mina is a miniature robot likeness of Mina that appears in \"Mina's Swing\", \"Goomo's Birthday\", and \"Look At Me!\", however her first cameo was in \"Mina's Party\" prior to her proper introduction."]}]}}
