Born Stephen Charles New, in the 2000s, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Stella Nova, whilst performing with the band Beastellabeast.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["Journalist Nick Kent of the New Musical Express (NME) jammed occasionally with the band, but left upon Lydon's recruitment. \"When I came along, I took one look at him and said, 'No.\u00a0That has to go,'\" Lydon later explained. \"He's never written a good word about me ever since.\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 78. See also Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 57\u201359. In September, McLaren again helped hire a private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, who had a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook \"created a smokescreen\" by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a \"Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders\" (referring to the lead guitarist of the New York Dolls, and later the Heartbreakers).Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, p. 86. Most of those who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created a new sense of solidarity among the four band members.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 125\u2013126. Steve New was considered the one talented guitarist to have tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, however, and the band's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, p. 87.", "In February 1977, word leaked out that Matlock was leaving the Sex Pistols. On 28 February, McLaren sent a telegram to the NME confirming the split. He claimed that Matlock had been \"thrown out...because he went on too long about Paul McCartney....The Beatles was too much.\"Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 56. In an interview a few months afterwards, Steve Jones echoed the charge that Matlock had been sacked because he \"liked The Beatles\". Years later, Jones expanded on the matter of the band's issues with Matlock: \"He was a good writer but he didn't look like a Sex Pistol and he was always washing his feet. His mum didn't like the songs.\" See also later Lydon quote: Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 307\u2013308. Matlock told the NME that he had voluntarily left the band by \"mutual agreement\". Later, in his autobiography, he described the primary impetus as his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten, exacerbated\u2014in Matlock's account\u2014by the rampant inflation of Rotten's ego \"once he'd had his name in the papers\".Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 113\u2013119, 162, 167\u2013171. Quote: p. 115. Lydon later claimed that \"God Save the Queen\", the belligerently sardonic song planned as the band's second single, had been the final straw: \"[Matlock] couldn't handle those kinds of lyrics. He said it declared us fascists.\" Though the singer could hardly see how anti-royalism equated with fascism, he claimed, \"Just to get rid of him, I didn't deny it.\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 3. See also pp. 82, 103. Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out in an effort to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 308.
