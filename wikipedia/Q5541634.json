His name has become almost synonymous with the now archaic long stop fielding position (i.e., directly behind the wicket-keeper) that was deemed so necessary in underarm days.\nAccording to Arthur Haygarth, Leer \"was a good and successful bat, but was mostly famous as long-stop to Thomas Brett\u2019s tremendous bowling in the Hambledon matches.  He was always called \"Little George\", and was a fine singer, having a sweet counter-tenor voice.  In John Nyren\u2019s book, he is stated to have been a native of Hambledon, but latterly he was a brewer, residing at Petersfield, where he died\".George Leer was a small man who made 44 known first-class appearances from the 1772 season to 1782.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Century (cricket)", "response": ["When Hambledon played Kent at Broadhalfpenny in August 1768, the Reading Mercury reported: \"what is very remarkable, one Mr Small, of Petersfield, fetched above seven score notches off his own bat\". Unfortunately it is not known if Small did this in one innings or if it was his match total. Hambledon batsmen Tom Sueter and George Leer are the first two players definitely known to have shared a century partnership when they made 128 for the first wicket against Surrey at Broadhalfpenny Down in September 1769.H.

John Minshull (aka Minchin) scored 107 for Dorset's XI in the second innings and this is the earliest century in any class of cricket that has definitely been recorded. There were eleven recorded matches in 1769. Surrey played Berkshire, winning by six runs on Datchet Common. This is the first time Berkshire is recorded as a county team and it became a strong centre of the game in the late 18th century, producing numerous players good enough to take part in major matches. On 28 September, Hambledon defeated Surrey by an innings and 41 runs after their opening batsmen, Tom Sueter and George Leer shared a century partnership of 128 for the first wicket; this was apparently a rare occurrence at the time."]}, {"page": "Richard Nyren", "response": ["In 1776, Hampshire finally turned the tables on Kent, winning three and losing one of their four fixtures.  Nyren took part in all 7 known first-class matches that Hampshire played this season.  In the first game, he scored 70 and 19 against Kent at Sevenoaks Vine, Hampshire winning by 75 runs in a low-scoring match, so his runs made all the difference; he also bowled well, taking at least 3 wickets.Haygarth, p. 27. Later in the season, in another match at Sevenoaks against All-England, Nyren and George Leer shared an unbeaten 5th wicket partnership of at least 50 to steer Hampshire to a six wicket victory.Haygarth, p. 29. When Hampshire beat Surrey by 198 runs at Broadhalfpenny Down on 26 August, it was largely due to Nyren's bowling as he took 5 wickets (all bowled) in the first innings.Haygarth, p. 30."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers to 1771", "response": ["| George Leer"]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["* 1767 \u2013 two Hampshire batsmen (believed to have been Tom Sueter and either George Leer or Edward \"Curry\" Aburrow) recorded a first-wicket partnership of 192 against Surrey, but there is no record of their individual scores, although at least one of the batsmen probably made a personal century.H.
