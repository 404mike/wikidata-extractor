His name has become almost synonymous with the now archaic long stop fielding position (i.e., directly behind the wicket-keeper) that was deemed so necessary in underarm days.\nAccording to Arthur Haygarth, Leer \"was a good and successful bat, but was mostly famous as long-stop to Thomas Brett\u2019s tremendous bowling in the Hambledon matches.  He was always called \"Little George\", and was a fine singer, having a sweet counter-tenor voice.  In John Nyren\u2019s book, he is stated to have been a native of Hambledon, but latterly he was a brewer, residing at Petersfield, where he died\".George Leer was a small man who made 44 known first-class appearances from the 1772 season to 1782.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
