Both words come from head ornaments worn by ancient men and women to denote high status.  As Geoffrey Munn notes, \"The word 'tiara' is actually Persian in origin\u2014the name first denoted the high-peaked head-dresses of Persian kings, which were encircled by 'diadems' (bands of purple and white decoration). Now, it is used to describe almost every form of decorative head ornament.\"  Ancient Greeks and Romans used gold to make wreath-shaped head ornaments, while the Scythians' resembled a stiff halo that would serve as the inspiration for later Russian kokoshniks. The use of tiaras and diadems declined along with the decline of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity."]}, {"page": "Antiques Roadshow", "response": ["* Geoffrey Munn"]}, {"page": "Reydon", "response": ["*Geoffrey Munn OBE, MVO (born 1953), presenter on the BBC Antiques Roadshow, local historian, and author of Southwold \u2013 an Earthly Paradise"]}, {"page": "Steyning Grammar School", "response": ["*Geoffrey Munn OBE, MVO. author; managing director of London jewellers, Wartski, BBC Antiques Roadshow jewellery expert"]}, {"page": "Joe's Palace", "response": ["Graham appears obsessed with finding out some dark secret concerning his father's wealth (Graham inherited the wealth) and has hired many accountants and historians to research this.
