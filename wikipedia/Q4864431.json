In September 1990, before an away league match against Everton, Radio 5 Live commentator Mike Ingham remarked that \"M\u00f8lby's still only a substitute even though he'd probably walk into any other first division team\". Later that season, after Liverpool had knocked Brighton out of the FA Cup, Brighton manager Barry Lloyd expressed bemusement in a BBC post-match interview that M\u00f8lby was not being selected regularly. M\u00f8lby was very close to signing for Johan Cruyff's  F.C. Barcelona in November 1990, after a fee had been agreed of \u00a31.6 million and he had agreed a four-year contract. When he scored a penalty in a 4\u20130 home win over Luton Town it was expected to be his farewell to the Liverpool fans. However, this was followed by a breakdown in negotiations and he remained at Anfield. It would be more than five years before he finally did leave the club."]}, {"page": "Worthing F.C.", "response": ["After managing a return to the top division, Worthing joined the Isthmian League in 1977, initially in Division Two, but by 1983 they had reached the Premier Division under manager Barry Lloyd and in fact finished as runners-up in 1983\u201384 and 1984\u201385.
