He had his first professional match in January 2000 at Longton WMC against Chris Curtis. During Allmark's time in GBH, he won the British tag team titles twice, once with fellow trainee Timm Wiley and once with Robbie Dynamite. After this Allmark moved to Brian Dixon's All Star Wrestling. In 2001, Allmark became part of All Star's roster and found new tag team partners with Robbie Dynamite and Kid Cool. Teaming with Kid Cool became a lasting partnership as the pair became known as the UK Dream Team. Dynamite's partnership with Allmark was less successful with both men beginning a long-standing personal feud. On 7 April 2004, Allmark made his biggest appearance outside the UK when he was chosen to be a part of Team Britain during Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's America's X-Cup. During the PPV from Nashville, Tennessee, Allmark failed to win his singles match against Team Mexico's Mr. \u00c1guila but picked up a win in a tag match against Heavy Metal and Abismo Negro when Allmark's tag partner James Mason made one of the opponents submit. Team Mexico eventually won America's X-Cup. Back in England on 7 June 2005, the UK Dream Team defeated \"The Chippendales\", Mikey Whiplash (Michael Gilbert) and Johnny Midnight, to be recognized by All Star Promotions as the British Tag Team Champions.

He had to go back to hospital for more treatment. It was later announced that Dynamite and Allmark would meet in a no-holds-barred match on 18 March at the Victoria Hall in Hanley. However, this match never took place because only hours before the event Allmark received news that his 18-month-old son had been taken ill. The two rivals repeatedly met in matches throughout the rest of 2006, many of which were for Allmark's Mid-Heavyweight title. Dynamite finally defeated Allmark for the title in 2007.vIn 2006, Allmark became the head trainer at the All Star Wrestling school.
