Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message \"The ship is sinking\". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying \"But how can I leave these men?\". In response, Bullen cried out \"God bless you, my brave fellow! Here is my hand; I give you my word I will stay here with you!\". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.James, p. 77"]}, {"page": "William Carnegie, 7th Earl of Northesk", "response": ["Carnegie continued his stint of brief frigate commands into 1793, taking command of HMS Beaulieu in January and sailing her to the Leeward Islands before returning to England later in the year in HMS Andromeda escorting a convoy.Winfield, British Warships 1714-1792, p. 984Winfield, British Warships 1714-1792, p. 1017 His next true command was of the brand new 64-gun third rate HMS Monmouth from September 1796, with Charles Bullen as his first lieutenant.Winfield, British Warships 1793-1817, p. 260Marshall, Royal Naval Biography, p. 591 Carnegie and Monmouth were assigned to the North Sea Fleet of Admiral Adam Duncan the same year.Marshall, Royal Naval Biography, p. 200 On 12 May 1797 many ships of the fleet including Monmouth were at the Nore when the Nore Mutiny began.
