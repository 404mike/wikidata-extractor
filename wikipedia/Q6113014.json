Felix Huston: finally, mustered all the Rangers companies of central and western Texas, under Jack Hays and Ben McCulloch, and Texian militia from Bastrop and Gonzales, respectively under Ed Burleson and Mathew Caldwell, they were attacked by Texas Rangers and Militia at the Battle of Plum Creek near Lockhart. Texas official history says the Rangers, equipped with the new Paterson Colt revolvers, won the fight, but this is highly questionable as the Indians got away with a great many of the stolen horses and most of their plunder. Volunteers from Gonzales had gathered to attempt to stop the war party and together with all the ranger companies of east and central Texas, moved to intercept the Indians, which they did at Plum Creek, near the city of Lockhart on August 12, 1840. 80 Comanches were reported killed in the running gun battle (although only 12 bodies were recovered), unusually heavy casualties for the Indians, although they got away with the bulk of their plunder and stolen horses. The \u201cdefeated Comanches\u201d, on their side, did value this fight as a such great victory to enhance the chiefs\u2019 prestige."]}]}}
