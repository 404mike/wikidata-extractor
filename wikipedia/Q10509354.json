He progressed through the club's youth setup to make his first team debut at the age of 17, in September 1998. He spent five years at Home Park, appearing mainly as a substitute, but did make a significant contribution to the team that won the Third Division title in the 2001\u201302 season, making 18 league appearances. He scored his first league goal against Torquay United in April 2001, a club that he would join on loan during the 2002\u201303 season, and then on a permanent contract in January 2003.\nWills scored three league goals in the 2003\u201304 season, including two against Kidderminster Harriers, but was released from his contract in May 2004 to join non-league club Tiverton Town. He scored four goals in the Southern League, prior to being signed by Truro City for a four-figure fee in November 2005. Wills scored two of Truro's three goals in the 2007 FA Vase final victory at Wembley Stadium, and helped the club gain promotion to the Southern League for the first time. He had his contract cancelled by mutual consent in the summer of 2008 to focus on work commitments in Torbay, where he has played part-time for Dawlish Town and Stoke Gabriel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2002\u201303 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 January 2003 ||  Kevin Wills || Torquay United || Free", "| 29 November 2002 ||  Kevin Wills || Torquay United || 29 December 2002"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|-||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kevin Wills", "|18||0||2||0||1||0||21||0||||||Kevin Wills"]}, {"page": "Wills", "response": ["* Kevin Wills (b. 1980), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kevin Wills                                          ||10||1 ||2||0||0||0||2||0||14||1"]}, {"page": "Stoke Gabriel & Torbay Police F.C.", "response": ["* Kevin Wills"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["| 19|| || MF|| Kevin Wills|| 0|| 2|| 0"]}]}}
