Houlston continued his winning streak into 1936, with victories over Eddie Cullen of Ynysddu and Tommy Davies of Tylorstown, both held at the Market Hall in Caerphilly. His win over Davies was the first of four known fights he undertook in May 1936, all wins. He continued his punishing schedule with another four contests in August, with only a draw against Norman Rees of Abercwmboi spoiling a perfect start to the year.
