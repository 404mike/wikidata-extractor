She competed in that series for two years, before moving into the Volkswagen Racing Cup, where she competed for another two years. She made her move into the British GT Championship in 2012, taking second in the GT4 category in her debut season, driving for Century Motorsport.

His ELMS debut came at the 6 Hours of Castellet, but it would not be a successful one, with the car catching fire during the event. Once more in the Le Mans event, however, mechanical maladies struck, with suspension failure after 196 laps forcing the team to retire from a strong position. A podium at the 6 Hours of Donington, however, would prove to be the team's only point-scoring finish of the season, as the team once more failed to finish at the Petit Le Mans, following an electronics failure after 330 laps. In addition to his ELMS and 24 Hours of Le Mans entries, Hughes returned to the British GT Championship with Team WFR in the Ginetta G50 GT4, being partnered by Jody Fannin. The pairing dominated the GT4 category, winning eight of their ten races on the way to the title, and finishing 84.25 points ahead of nearest rival Zo\u00eb Wenham."]}, {"page": "Wenham", "response": ["*Zo\u00eb Wenham, (1994-), British racing driver"]}, {"page": "2012 British GT Championship", "response": ["|  Zo\u00eb Wenham", "|align=left|  Zo\u00eb Wenham"]}, {"page": "2013 British GT Championship", "response": ["|  Zo\u00eb Wenham", "|  Zo\u00eb Wenham", "|  Declan Jones Zo\u00eb Wenham", "|  Declan Jones Zo\u00eb Wenham", "|align=left|  Zo\u00eb Wenham"]}, {"page": "Jody Fannin", "response": ["For 2012, he made the move to the British GT series, driving a GT4-class Ginetta G50, but now for Team WFR, partnering the much more experienced Warren Hughes. The partnership was successful right from the start, as the duo won the first two events of the season, both held at Oulton Park. Fannin and Hughes went into the penultimate round of the season, held at Silverstone, only needing a fourth-place finish to take the title, and his win in that race sealed the title, even though he had only completed six laps of the track prior to the event. Fannin and Hughes would finish on 243.5 points, 84.5 points ahead of Zo\u00eb Wenham in second place, having won eight of the ten races that season. Following his championship victory, he entered the final three rounds of the Dutch GT Championship, still driving for Team WFR in the G50, held at Zandvoort Circuit. It proved to be a successful venture, with a fourth-place finish in the first sprint race, fourteenth (and last) in the second sprint race after a mechanical failure, and a second place in the third, and final, race of the weekend. He also entered the final round of the Blancpain Endurance Series, held at the Spanish Circuito de Navarra, driving a Ferrari 458 Italia GT3 entered by Scuderia Vittoria.
