He later became better known for playing Ray Daley in the television series Minder, replacing Dennis Waterman as George Cole's on-screen sparring partner in the series. Webster joined the series in 1991 and remained until its conclusion in 1994.\nSubsequent to this Webster took roles in soap operas. He made a brief appearance in Hollyoaks as Dion in 2001, and in Crossroads as Richard Mason the same year. He was later a regular in serial Family Affairs, playing Gary Costello from 2003 until the series ended at the end of 2005. He played tough drugs baron, Paul Haskew in ITV drama series The Bill. In 2016, he returned to EastEnders, this time playing Neville Peacock in four episodes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whitechapel", "response": ["* Gary Webster, actor"]}, {"page": "Family Affairs", "response": ["Another series of new characters were brought in to remould Family Affairs once again. Gary Costello (Gary Webster), a businessman who lost his fortune in a failed business deal, was forced to move from Chigwell to the comparatively modest Stanley Street, much to the shame and embarrassment of his snobbish, socialite wife Chrissie (Kazia Pelka). Their daughters Melanie (Rebecca Hunter) and Chloe (Leah Coombes), were more concerned about leaving behind their school friends. They were later joined by Gary's dependable mother Myra (Kate Williams).", "|Gary Costello || Gary Webster || 2003\u20132005"]}, {"page": "Minder (TV series)", "response": ["In 1989, after filming the seventh series, Waterman announced he had left the series, feeling that the character had run its course, and that it was becoming harder for the writers to come up with plots as sharp as had been customary in the series. This seemed to signify the end, but the series made another return in 1991, with another character replacing Terry. Waterman's final broadcast episode, Series 7's coincidentally titled \"The Wrong Goodbye\", had closed as a standard episode, filmed before Waterman's announcement that he was to leave and so with no clue as to Terry's forthcoming departure. In the opening episode of series 8, \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Entrepreneur\", Arthur finds Terry (unseen in the episode) had married and emigrated to Australia (despite the character's criminal background making the likelihood of emigration almost impossible) to finally escape his influence. At the same time, he is stuck with looking after his nephew Ray Daley (Gary Webster), at the request of Arthur's brother to give him employment and keep him out of trouble.", "The original theme tune was replaced by a rock-style instrumental version, credited to \"Kenny\" (Gerard Kenny). By this stage, the rough and ready elements of the early series had been toned down, concentrating on the comedic aspects of Arthur's dodgy dealings. Waterman praised Gary Webster for fitting into the series, but was vocal in his comments that the series was no longer about a minder and that the revamped version should go under a different title, reflecting its orientation almost solidly around Arthur.", "The show's opening credit sequence shows the Arthur Daley and Terry McCann characters negotiating over the sale of the white Ford Capri interspersed with still photos of the two main characters, highlighting Terry's credentials as a retired boxer and ex-convict, this presumably symbolising the characters' first meeting and the terms of their partnership. During the Dennis Waterman era, the closing credits consisted of a number of black and white (with blue tint) still photographs of Arthur and Terry together outside famous London landmarks, and a few hinting of (unseen) previous escapades typical of a standard episode plot. In the later Gary Webster series, this changed to Arthur and Ray walking along Southend Pier, which is over a mile long: at the end Arthur realises he has left his lighter at the other end of the pier and they start to walk back to find it."]}, {"page": "Taggart", "response": ["* Gary Webster (Episode: Evil Eye)"]}, {"page": "Stacey Slater", "response": ["After being released, Stacey tries to talk to Masood but instead he rebuffs her apology, blaming her for Shabnam leaving.
