R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that \"his footwork was, as near as is humanly possible, perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body.\"Robertson-Glasgow, p. 10. He played every type of shot\u2014he did not have a \"signature\" shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively;Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 10\u201311. according to Alec Kennedy, who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do. In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot.McKinstry, p. 116. Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run; he also ran well between the wickets. He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them.Murphy, pp. 42\u201343. Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots. After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age, and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period;Arlott, pp. 74\u201375.McKinstry, pp. 118\u201319. Cardus wrote that \"he scored his centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them.\" This was the period in which he became known as \"The Master\",Murphy, p. 39. and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection; 98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40."]}, {"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["Appointed as Gloucestershire captain for the 1939 season, Hammond led the team to third in the County Championship and recorded a rare double victory over Yorkshire. While Wisden commended his adventurous style of leadership, others such as Basil Allen, his predecessor as captain, did not approve; their main criticism was his failure to encourage his players.Howat, p. 91.Foot, pp. 103, 105, 165. In first-class cricket, he scored 2,479 runs at an average of 63.56. He placed at the top of the first-class averages for the seventh successive season, although some critics detected a decline in his abilities. While he led England to a 1\u20130 series victory over West Indies in three Tests, Wisden reported some criticism of his captaincy. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said that \"Hammond does not rank among the more imaginative England captains\", although he concluded by defending Hammond as \"experienced and sound\". In the second match, he took his 100th catch in Tests, and in the third, he scored 138, his final Test century. In the series, Hammond scored 279 runs (average 55.80). The impending war overshadowed much of the season; throughout the Tests, Hammond made public appeals for citizens to join the armed forces.Howat, p. 90. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the services and was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) in October 1939.Howat, p. 93."]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["Jardine was seen as having a classical technique. While batting, he stood very straight and side on to the bowler. His off-driving was powerful, his defence was excellent, and he was superb at judging the line of the ball and letting it pass by if it was going to miss his wickets. His on-side play was also excellent, being able to place the ball between fielders for easy runs.Douglas, pp. 55\u201356. Christopher Douglas described Jardine as \"the epitome of the old-fashioned amateur\". However, he also comments that his approach to batting was like that of a professional and that his back-foot batting was of a quality that few amateurs could manage. In 1928, Wisden's correspondent described Jardine as the most secure amateur batsman of the time, and identified his greatest strength as his defence and his \"mental gifts.\" He played very straight and hit the ball hard in defence, but could not play all the strokes, particularly on the off side. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed that Jardine had modelled himself on C. B. Fry. He also noted that Jardine displayed good concentration, a strong desire to improve his batting and a fighting spirit that brought out his best in a crisis.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 21. He also said that Jardine could play every recognised cricket shot, but would not do so in a match and Robertson-Glasgow believed it was Jardine's one weakness as a batsman. The more important the occasion, the more defensive and restricted Jardine's batting became: \"In general, as the task grew greater, the strokes grew fewer.\""]}, {"page": "Hedley Verity", "response": ["As a bowler, Verity delivered the ball at almost medium pace, faster than usual for a spinner.Hill, p. 158. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, a cricket writer and journalist, wrote \"He is a scholarly bowler\u00a0... He is tall, and much stronger than his pace needs. His run up, longer than most of his kind, has a measured delicacy that you would expect from this fastidious and nearly prim craftsman. Only his delivery has a grace which mathematics can't explain.\"Robertson-Glasgow, p. 80. His main asset as a bowler was an ability to bowl straight and with great accuracy, on a good length. He could also make the ball bounce sharply. His most effective delivery  curved through the air, pitched on middle and leg stump and spun away from the batsman, causing many of them to edge the ball into the slips.Hill, pp. 157\u201358. On  rain-affected pitches he bowled more slowly, and was almost unplayable at times.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 79. However, the period in which Verity played was notable for good batting pitches, and batsmen often dominated. In these conditions, Verity prevented batsmen scoring runs and constantly tried new strategies to try to take wickets. Verity also used different types of delivery to keep batsmen uncertain: he could bowl at a slower and faster pace to his normal style and occasionally bowled a much faster ball which regularly took wickets.Hill, p. 161."]}, {"page": "Cricket in Scotland", "response": ["R. C. Robertson-Glasgow played for Oxford University and Somerset and later became a prominent cricket writer and correspondent.

He encouraged the search for promising young cricketers, and most of the club's professional cricketers during its successful years in the 1930s were discovered during Gilligan's drive for new talent.Lee, p. 161. Percy Fender believed that Gilligan allowed the team's professionals a greater say in Sussex's affairs than previously permitted. Fender wrote that Gilligan's teams enjoyed playing under him and that he was one of the most popular captains in county cricket. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said: \"With him there was no sharpnesses, no petty restraints, no mathematical cricket. He won or lost plumb straight\". Swanton wrote that \"Gilligan was essentially a friendly man, hail-fellow-well-met, and it is hard to think that in the world of sport he ever made an enemy.\"Swanton, pp. 141\u201342."]}, {"page": "Percy Chapman", "response": ["Writer Neville Cardus described Chapman as \"the schoolboy's dream of the perfect captain of an England cricket eleven. He was tall, slim, always youthful, and pink and chubby of face. His left-handed batting mingled brilliance and grace\u00a0... His cricket was romantic in its vaunting energy but classic in shape.\" While batting, Chapman always tried to attack the bowling; although this meant he made mistakes which resulted in his dismissal,Robertson-Glasgow, p. 36. it meant that he could change the course of a game in a short time.Swanton, p. 138. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow described him as: \"Tall, strong, and lithe, he was a left-handed hitter with orthodox defence, much of which was rendered unnecessary by a vast reach, and an ability to drive good-length balls over the head of mid-off, bowler, and mid-on. His cover-driving, too, was immensely strong.\" Gibson notes that Chapman's career batting figures were good, but that critics believed that, with his talent, he should have scored more runs.Gibson, pp. 146\u201347. Gibson writes: \"When Chapman was going well, he looked quite as good as Woolley [his Kent and England team-mate] at the other end, and in the mid-1920s there was no other English left-hander, possibly no other England batsman at all except Hobbs, of whom that could be said.\" His increased weight in the 1930s robbed him of confidence and slowed him down to the point where his batting declined. When batting, Chapman usually wore the Quidnuncs cap."]}, {"page": "Jack White (cricketer, born 1891)", "response": ["His Somerset team-mate R. C.

Critics judged him to have an excellent bowling action, through which he achieved his pace. He bowled from sideways on, and according to his Wisden obituary, had \"a rhythmical run-up and full follow-through\". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow described Allen in 1943: \"Of no more than medium height, he has a solid yet elastic strength, every unit of which is used in the delivery and in a follow-through which is the finest I have ever seen.\"Robertson-Glasgow, p. 67. Robertson-Glasgow continued: \"His bowling, though it varies from piercing accuracy to almost ludicrous irrelevance, has often touched greatness.\" Although opposed to Bodyline tactics in Australia, Allen often bowled short to intimidate batsmen in county cricket\u2014for example, he once struck Wyatt over the heart with a fast ball.Marshall, p. 16.Douglas, pp. 133, 135."]}, {"page": "Learie Constantine", "response": ["Swanton believed that Constantine was the first West Indian cricketer to make an impression on the British public: \"he\u00a0... personified West Indian cricket from the first faltering entry in the Test arena in 1928 until the post-war emergence of the trinity of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott.\" Swanton continued: \"There have been many all-rounders with better records\u00a0... but it is hard to think of one who made a more sensational impact [and] impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere.\" In 1934 Neville Cardus described Constantine as a \"genius\" and the \"most original cricketer of recent years\". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow called Constantine the most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 123.

Bradman's dominant cricketing stature was a key factor in his team's popularity with the public, especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign. A leading cricket writer of the time, R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, said \"we want him to do well. We feel we have a share in him. He is more than Australian. He is a world batsman.\"Haigh and Frith, p. 101. The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that \"cities, towns and hotels are beflagged, carpets set down, and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome.

Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day, and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live, causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin.

The hostile barrage of short-pitched bowling had a major impact on Ponsford's technique and career. In the three Tests that Ponsford played during the Bodyline series, he estimated he was hit around fifty times. During the series Ponsford developed a habit of turning his back on the rising ball and, if hit, glowering at the affected bowler.Robinson (1946), p. 147. While the manager of the England team, Pelham Warner, thought that Ponsford \"met the fast-leg theory in plucky and able style\",Robinson (1946), p. 148. this behaviour was criticised by the British cricket writer, R.

His first-class batting figures were not exceptional compared to other cricketers who played far fewer Test matches,Gibson, pp. 140\u201341. but in Tests, his average is six runs an innings higher; against Australia, the strongest of England's opponents during his career, he averaged 56, a further increase of ten runs. Gibson suggests that he rose to the big occasions, and that he performed best against the toughest opponents. According to Leyland's obituary in The Times, \"He was essentially a man for the big occasion, a batsman at his best in a crisis, and his favourite game was a Roses match or an Australian Test. England's supporters often breathed a sigh of relief to see his burly figure purposefully striding to the wicket.\" The writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that Leyland in a Test match was like the \"four-squarers of ancient or romantic times. He was Horatius on the tottering bridge; Hector, who alone stood between Troy and destruction. He was born to rescue. But he is more dangerous than those who are stubborn or grim. He has something of D'Artagnan in him; there is a gaiety besides the simplicity and strength; seen in the slight list of the cap, and in a certain jauntiness and optimism of gait.\"Robertson-Glasgow, p. 19."]}, {"page": "Donald Knight (cricketer)", "response": ["A stylish opening batsman, Knight first played for Surrey in 1911 while he was still a schoolboy at Malvern College, and won a Blue while studying at Trinity College, Oxford, either side of the First World War.

At the start of an innings, when the ball was new and hard, he opened the bowling with medium-fast deliveries that swung away from right-handed batsmen. In this style, he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow considered him to be better than any similar bowler in the 1920s except Maurice Tate, the leading medium paced bowler in England.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 136. Macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on the needs of the match situation and the type of pitch.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 135. When the pitch was suitable for spinning the ball, he bowled medium-paced off breaks. Wisden said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a sticky wicket, a pitch which has been affected by rain, making it erratic and difficult to bat on. His obituary further stated: \"Under suitable conditions for using the off-break, batsmen seemed at his mercy.\" This was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out, but at the same time it was very difficult to score runs against him. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that \"on a rain-damaged pitch he was in his glory.\" He would make small adjustments to the positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of the wicket, often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so. Robertson-Glasgow said that \"only the best could survive the onslaught except by a miracle\", and described Macaulay as a great bowler.
