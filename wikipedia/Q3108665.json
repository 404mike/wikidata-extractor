He was a teacher at the V&A (1967\u201374).  His first solo exhibition was held at New York's Gotham Book Mart Gallery.  Baxter's artwork has appeared in The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and The Independent on Sunday.  His images and their corresponding captions employ art and language inspired by pulp fiction and adventure comics with intellectual jokes and references. His simple line-drawings often feature cowboys, gangsters, explorers and schoolchildren, who utter incongruous intellectual statements regarding art and philosophy.  One of his best known satirical works, The Impending Gleam was first published in 1981.\nToday the artist lives and works in London. With Flowers Gallery, Baxter has had a number of solo shows such as; Furtive Loomings (2017), Tofu Walk With Me (2015), and Glen Baxter: The Soul in Torment, Parts I & II (2012).In August 2014, Baxter was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.In May 2016, the New York Review of Books published a collection of Baxter's work including popular selections from his career as well as new cartoons titled, Almost Completely Baxter: New and Selected Blurtings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cartoonists", "response": ["* Glen Baxter"]}, {"page": "Tusk Trust", "response": ["Each rhino was specially designed, decorated and embellished by internationally renowned artists including Glen Baxter, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Eileen Cooper, Adam Dant, Nancy Fouts, Nick Gentry, Zhang Huan, Patrick Hughes, David Mach, Harland Miller, Marc Quinn, Axel Scheffler, Gavin Turk, Dave White, Ronnie Wood, David Yarrow and Jonathan Yeo."]}, {"page": "Glen Baxter", "response": ["Glen Baxter is the name of:", "* Glen Baxter (artist) (born 1944), British cartoonist", "* Glen Baxter (journalist), Canadian journalist"]}, {"page": "Glen Baxter (cartoonist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Glen Baxter (artist)"]}]}}
