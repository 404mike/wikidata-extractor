The headstone in Poelkapelle Cemetery and the CWGC record continue to assert the challenged data.It is asserted and documented that \n\nThe body in the unmarked grave was misidentified as Condon based on an ambiguous boot stamping 6322 4/R.I.R. found at exhumation.\nThe stamp was interpreted by the Imperial War Graves Commission as being Regimental Number 6322 of the 4th Battalion Royal Irish Regiment.\nCondon was not in the 4th but the 3rd battalion\nThe same stamping could denote 6322 Rifleman Patrick Fitzsimmons, 2nd Bn. Royal Irish Rifles, KIA 16 June 1915, who had been in the 4th battalion Royal Irish Rifles.\nWhile the 2nd R.I. Rifles fought at the location of the exhumation, the 3rd R.I. Regiment did not.\nNo body was ever identified as 6322 Rifleman Patrick Fitzsimmons.  He is listed on the Menin Gate memorial.", "link_mentions": {}}}
