Her laboratory investigates how bacteria come together to form social communities called biofilms. More specifically, her research analyses the way the molecules in the biofilm matrix provide support and protection to biofilms formed by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis.\nIn 2012, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology. In 2018, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.She is an advocate for public engagement in science and has taken part in national and international events. Stanley-Wall was awarded the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Beltane Prize for Public Engagement in 2012 and became Academic Lead for Public Engagement for the School. In this role she led in the process that resulted in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee, being the first faculty in the country to be awarded a Gold Engage Watermark by the National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement. In 2018, the University of Dundee's School of Life Sciences hosted the Magnificent Microbes! event with the Dundee Science Centre. She is a member of the Young Academy of Scotland where she is part of the Excellence in Education group.As part of her interest in science communication, she and her colleague Kelsey McOwat created the 'Blast a Biofilm' board game to raise awareness and knowledge of biofilms in young learners. Due to the increasing risk of antibiotic resistance and correlating decrease in effective clinical treatments, this work has a clear pathway to impact. In addition, the Stanley-Wall lab has worked with a scientific animation company, Vivomotion, to make an animation that explains what biofilms are and how they impact people's everyday lives.[1]\nAbout her work, she states, \"I love my job as it involves original thinking, scientific enquiry, and versatility: skills that I have enjoyed developing over the course of my career.\"In 2015, she was part of a team including Cait MacPhee that aimed to develop ice cream that does not melt.In 2019, Dr Stanley-Wall was one of the female scientists celebrated by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in its photo exhibition at the entrance of the RSE building.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cait MacPhee", "response": ["MacPhee's research into the Bs1a protein from Bacillus subtilis, together with Nicola Stanley-Wall from the School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, has been widely reported because of potential applications in the production of ice cream. She was appointed CBE in the 2016 New Year Honours \"for services to women in physics\", and was subsequently elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.  In 2016 she was selected as a finalist for the BBSRC Innovator of the Year competition. In 2018 she was awarded the Gabor Medal of the Royal Society."]}, {"page": "Fleming Prize Lecture", "response": ["*2009 Nicola Stanley-Wall  The Complexity of Biofilm Formation by Bacillus subtilis"]}]}}
