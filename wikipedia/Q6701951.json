He first joined Northamptonshire on a 1-month loan on 15 April 2010, but stayed at the county for only 16 days before being recalled. At the end of the 2010 season Evans was released and was immediately snapped up by David Capel at Northants.Evans's Northants career had been blighted by injuries, but he returned at the end of the 2012 season gaining 12 wickets in total against Gloucestershire and Hampshire, this prompted coach David Ripley to offer him a new one-year contract.
