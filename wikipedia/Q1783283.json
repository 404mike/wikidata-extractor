After a requested hearing with the FA, Van Gaal was cleared of his charges, but was warned of future conduct. On 8 February, Van Gaal was criticised by West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce for his long ball tactics after the Hammers conceded a late equaliser to United.

Many people disagreed with this decision and felt that the FA had failed to act. On 17 April, Ag\u00fcero revealed that he had apologised to David Luiz for his rash challenge on the defender. Ag\u00fcero withdrew as a precaution at half-time on 17 April in Manchester City's 1\u20130 home victory over Wigan after feeling tightness in a hamstring, but he appeared as an unused substitute in City's 3\u20131 away loss at White Hart Lane against Tottenham on 21 April.
