He was given his first professional contract two years later and made his senior debut on 18 August 1979, scoring in the 2\u20133 defeat away at Newcastle United. He became a first-team regular for Oldham over the following four seasons and scored a total of 11 goals in 143 league matches for the club. In July 1983, Atkinson was signed by Watford manager Graham Taylor for a transfer fee of \u00a3175,000. A broken ankle sustained in pre-season delayed his debut in the First Division. When he returned to action later in the season, he failed to hold down a regular place in the team and played only 11 league games. Atkinson's last appearance for Watford came on 19 May 1984, coming on as a second-half substitute for Neil Price in the 0\u20132 defeat to Everton in the 1984 FA Cup Final.

Paul Atkinson, Mo Johnston and Neil Price all featured for Watford in the 1984 FA Cup Final. Nick Wright scored the opening goal in Watford's 2\u20130 win over Bolton in the 1999 Football League First Division play-off Final, a game that Israel international Alon Hazan also participated in. Several players have gone on to become Premier League footballers following successful loan spells at Watford, including Chris Eagles and England international Adam Johnson; others such as Alexandre Bonnot and Steve Brooker played their only top division games in English football with Watford. In the 2009\u201310 season, on-loan Tom Cleverley became the first person ever to win the club's Player of the Season award having made fewer than 50 Watford appearances. Others made significant contributions to the club after their careers ended. Examples include Ron Gray, who managed the club after he retired as a player, and Price, who at various points commentated on the club's matches for the BBC, worked for the club, and formed the Watford Former Players' Association.Smith, Frank (30 March 2012). \"A pub 'to call home and their own'\".

In his early years, players such as Kenny Jackett progressed to the first team. Under his management, Watford won the FA Youth Cup in 1982.

Walley was promoted to first-team coach in 1988 by manager Steve Harrison. When Harrison moved to Millwall in 1990, Walley joined him as a youth coach, and in his first full season Walley lifted the FA Youth Cup for the second time in 1991. Just as he did at Watford, he followed this with a second final three years later. Walley left Millwall to join Arsenal in 1996, serving under Bruce Rioch and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.
