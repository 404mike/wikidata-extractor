Though he was reselected by the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association to contest his seat in the House of Commons shortly before the 2005 general election, he was forced to retire owing to ill health.\nHe was criticised by the Committee on Standards and Privileges for being \"at the least negligent, at the worst careless\" in respect of a company in which he had an interest, but no evidence was found that he had directly received any improper payments. In the investigation by Sir Thomas Legg into MPs' expenses, he was one of the minority of MPs who were completely cleared of any misuse of their second home allowances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Jonathan Sayeed", "| Jonathan Sayeed", "*Jonathan Sayeed (Mid Bedfordshire) - Conservative whip temporarily suspended on 3 February to 7 March; whip permanently suspended later in March"]}, {"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jonathan Sayeed"]}, {"page": "1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jonathan Sayeed"]}, {"page": "Tony Benn", "response": ["For the 1983 election Benn's Bristol South East constituency was abolished by boundary changes, and he lost to Michael Cocks in the selection of a candidate to stand in the new winnable seat of Bristol South.

Foot resigned as leader following the defeat which reduced Labour to only 209 MPs, while Healey also decided to step down as deputy leader.
