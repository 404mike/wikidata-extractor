With Pearson performing poorly, Darren Hughes was signed from Brighton & Hove Albion for a \u00a310,000 fee. Paul Smith was also offloaded to Lincoln City for \u00a340,000.

Alex Williams was also forced to retire with a back injury, leading to the return of a fit again Mark Grew in goal. More injuries came as Chris Banks had his nose broken after a reserve match at Barnsley when he was attacked by a gang of youths whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop. Alan Webb then suffered second degree burns at Preston North End's plastic pitch at Deepdale. The next month Rudge tried to replace Jones when he signed David Riley from Nottingham Forest for \u00a320,000. Despite a good start Riley soon entered a goal drought, as Vale went twelve league games without a win (including eight defeats). Robbie Earle missed much of this period with a hernia injury. In November Kevin Steggles was signed from West Bromwich Albion for 'a small fee' to replace the still-injured Webb. More signings were made with former England international Peter Barnes arriving on loan from Manchester City, and 'hard-working' Simon Mills purchased from York City for \u00a335,000.", "On the financial side, the cup run and sale of Jones had raised a record profit of \u00a3410,239.
