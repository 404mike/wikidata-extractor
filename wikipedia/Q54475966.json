Barry was searching for the soldier and had picked up the scent, some forty-eight hours old, and finally stopped before a large bank of ice. He dug until he reached the soldier, and then licked him as he was trained. The Swiss soldier awoke startled and mistook Barry for a wolf and fatally stabbed him with his bayonet. James Watson in his 1906 work The Dog Book attributed the rumour to fellow author Idstone, also known as Reverend Thomas Pearce."]}, {"page": "Thomas Pearce", "response": ["* Thomas Pearce (British Army officer) (c. 1670\u20131739), British army lieutenant general and Member of Parliament", "* Thomas Pearce (priest) (1820\u20131885), English clergyman, known under the pseudonym \"Idstone\" as an author on dogs", "* Thomas Pearce (cricketer, born 1847) (1847\u20131898), English cricketer", "* Thomas Pearce (MP), Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (1722\u20131737)"]}, {"page": "Charles Henry Blake", "response": ["*Fanny Georgina, who married in 1852 Thomas Pearce."]}]}}
