In 1976 he discovered the \"double scan\" property of certain support verb constructions, which systematically identifies idioms. Gross's computer-assisted research on large amounts of linguistic material led to a picture of language as an instrument that is freely manipulated yet highly constrained idiomatically, a result that is consistent with the distinction between the Idiom Principle and the Open Choice Principle found by corpus linguist John McHardy Sinclair (1933 -2007).Seretan, Violeta (2011) Syntax-based collocation extraction. Text, speech and language technology series 44, Springer Verlag, p.\u00a018. Gross described the organization of language as a lexicon-grammar,Gross (1994, 2006). and argued that any grammar must fail if its formalization fails to take into account its dependence on the lexicon.Gross, M. 1979. \"On the failure of Generative Grammar\" Language 55:4.859-885.
