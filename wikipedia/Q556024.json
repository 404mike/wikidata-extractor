He is best known for his live events and electronic music as a solo artist, as well as his collaborations with British DJ John Digweed as Sasha & John Digweed. He was voted as World No.\u2060\u200a\u20601 DJ in 2000 in a poll conducted by DJ Magazine. He is a four-time International Dance Music Awards winner, four-time DJ Awards winner and Grammy Award nominee.Sasha began his career playing acid house music in the late 1980s. He partnered with John Digweed in 1993, touring internationally and producing a series of mix albums (compilations of other artists' work played in a continuous fashion).Sasha has remixed tracks for artists such as D-Ream, Madonna, Moby, The Chemical Brothers and Hot Chip. Sasha's remixing and production often combine electronic music genres, making it difficult for critics to pinpoint his musical style. As well as remixes and compilation albums, Sasha has produced three albums of original works: The Qat Collection in 1994, Airdrawndagger in 2002, and Scene Delete in 2016.\nAfter achieving success as a producer and DJ, Sasha worked with younger DJs and producers such as BT and James Zabiela. His use of live audio engineering equipment helped popularise technological innovations among DJs who formerly relied on records and turntables. In 2007, he formed a record label with Renaissance Records called emFire, which is the exclusive outlet for his new music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Digweed", "response": ["Thomas John Digweed (born 1 January 1967) is a British DJ and record producer.IMO Records. \"John Digweed Biography\", IMO Records' Retrieved on 29 February 2011.

His breakthrough came in 1993, when he sent a mixtape demo to Geoff Oakes, founder of the Renaissance nightclub in Mansfield, who played it to fellow DJ Alexander Coe (aka Sasha). The two DJs struck up a long-term friendship and working relationship, despite Sasha twice failing to turn up for gigs that Digweed had booked him for in Hastings.", "In partnership with Sasha, Digweed is known for promoting progressive house and notable for producing the first commercial compilation for a nightclub, when they released their 1994 compilation of mixes from Renaissance entitled Renaissance: The Mix Collection. Until then, mixtapes from clubs had only been circulated by DJs on an amateur basis. The Renaissance CD was the first time that a compilation CD had been planned strategically for marketing, from artwork to promotion. The two DJs famously followed this up with their Northern Exposure compilations and those on Global Underground.", "Digweed has enjoyed popularity throughout North America as well as Europe. He and Sasha established a monthly residency at the now defunct New York club Twilo, which proved a key location for the American electronic music scene. The residency began in 1997 with a lukewarm reception, but grew into one of the most popular club nights in New York City by the end of its run in 2001. Sasha and Digweed played at Twilo on the last Friday of every month, playing sets that lasted between eight and twelve hours. In early 2001, Sasha suffered an ear injury and was unable to play for their last four dates before Twilo was closed by the New York City authorities. Digweed continued to play the time-slot by himself until 6 May 2001, when Twilo was raided by the NYPD and subsequently forced to close down.", "In early 2002, Digweed along with Sasha and Jimmy Van M undertook a six-week countrywide tour of the United States called Delta Heavy.

The band also clearly influenced 1990s and 2000s trance music, notably Chicane; both  \"Offshore\" and \"Sunstroke\" borrow heavily from \"Love on a Real Train\"  where lush soundscapes and synth pads are used along with repetitive synth sequences, much like in their 1975 releases Rubycon and Ricochet, as well as some of their music from the early 1980s.

Digweed had been DJing for ten years before getting a gig at Renaissance where he met Sasha, who had been working the past few years in various acid house music clubs and raves. Together, they honed their DJ skills, focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. In 1994, they released the triple CD mix album Renaissance: The Mix Collection on Renaissance Records. It contained many popular dance hits of the time from artists such as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice as well as original productions and remixes from themselves. Two years later, the duo became \"true superstars\" (AllMusic) with the release of their double CD Northern Exposure on mega-label Ministry of Sound.  This release was brought to the United States the next year in a single CD package on Ultra Records.  1997 saw the release of the Northern Exposure 2 double CD mix album, again on Ministry of Sound.  Sasha and Digweed toured internationally, helping define the sound of progressive house & trance music in the late 1990s. In 1998, both John Digweed and Sasha released separate mix albums on Boxed as part of the Global Underground series with Digweed's GU 006: Sydney and Sasha's GU 009: San Francisco release.", "In the late 1990s, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City's famous Twilo nightclub as well as releasing their third edition in the Northern Exposure series: Northern Exposure: Expeditions. They both continued their success in the Global Underground series with Digweed's GU 014: Hong Kong and Sasha's GU 013: Ibiza.  In addition to their residency, they toured the United States, especially to promote their DJ mix Communicate in 2000.  Shortly thereafter, they embarked on their international Delta Heavy Tour in 2002.  They have collaborated little since Delta Heavy. They appeared together at the 2007 Bonnaroo Music Festival, and counted down the new year during a four-hour set in Los Angeles at Together As One.", "In 2008, Sasha & Digweed announced their plans to do another tour of North America taking in 21 cities in one month, as they announced the Sasha and John Digweed Spring Club Tour 2008. The tour began at the Winter Music Conference on 27 March at the club Mansion. This was the first time they toured North America together in six years.", "In 2009, Sasha & Digweed headlined the SW4 festival in London's Clapham Common.", "In early 1993, Renaissance DJs Sasha and John Digweed teamed up for DJ sets together. The pair had honed their DJing skills, often performing in tandem and focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. Renaissance was pleased with their performances together. Renaissance decided to let the duo compile the triple mix album, entitled Renaissance - The Mix Collection, releasing it on the club's own Renaissance Records label in April 1994, by which point Sasha had already left Renaissance. Sasha had been featured on the cover of Mixmag with the tagline \"SON OF GOD?\", though he did not welcome the accolade. The album featured tracks from such artists as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice, and original productions and remixes from Sasha and Digweed, and was successful in the UK Compilation Chart where it peaked at #9. Another album, Renaissance: The Mix Collection Part 2, acting as the second part to Renaissance: The Mix Collection, was released in 1995. As Sasha had left Renaissance, John Digweed mixed this album alone.", "In 1997, the duo worked on a follow up to Northern Exposure, again following the concept album theme, with one disc representing the West Coast and the other disc the East Coast. It was released in 1997 on the Ministry of Sound label as Northern Exposure 2. The album only charted at #15 in the UK Compilation Chart but it was again a critical success. To support the album, the duo toured internationally, and in the process helped to define the sound of trance music in the late 1990s.  After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City's famous Twilo nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night.  In 1998, the two released separate mix albums on the Boxed label, as part of the Global Underground series: Digweed's Global Underground 006: Sydney, and Sasha's Global Underground 009: San Francisco, which drew from Sasha's experience touring on the West Coast of the United States. Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started Bedrock Records. Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency \"Excession: The Agency LTD.\"  Excession remains a booking agency for many DJs, including Hybrid, Nick Warren, and Steve Lawler.", "In 1998, Sasha and Digweed reunited in the studio to record their third and final album for the Northern Exposure series, Northern Exposure: Expeditions, which saw the duo voyage into exploring vocal trance. Popular with critics, it charted better in the UK Compilations Chart than their previous albums, the CD version charting at #6 (the vinyl edition of the album, largely different from the CD version, charted at #37).", "In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album Communicate in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their Twilo residency for a promotional tour of the United States. Communicate had reasonable commercial success, but it received mixed reviews: Spin stated that despite a \"few stellar moments, [Communicate] is ultimately a let-down\".  LAUNCHcast, too, described Communicate as \"boring and lackluster...stalled in a monochrome world of dead beats\". To promote the album, the duo toured the United States.", "During the late 1990s, the increased popularity and visibility of \"superstar DJs\" led to the creation of superclubs such as Liverpool's Cream and Sheffield's Gatecrasher. By 2003, however, electronic dance music clubs languished. Though dance music had been declared \"dead\" by many in the dance industry, Sasha continued to tour\u2014despite the closing of many superclubs, including his resident club Twilo in May 2001.

The tour featured veteran tour producer Kevin Lyman and opening act Jimmy Van M, the tour covered 31\u00a0cities and played to 85,000\u00a0people.  The appearances were complete with laser shows and video production, were similar to rock concerts than to typical DJ events.  This motif was new to the DJing scene, and compelled other DJs to host similar concerts.", "2004 marked the tenth anniversary of Renaissance: The Mix Collection, which had been out of print for years prior. Sasha and Digweed decided to release an anniversary edition of the album. However, rather than re-release the album straight forward, they recreated the album in a brand new session. Two tracks by M People that featured on the original 1994 release had to be dropped due to licensing issues, so they were replaced by a track each by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Anthony White respectively. Though the original blend sequences from the original album remained the same, Sasha and Digweed re-created the album using Apple G4 laptops in order to create, what they considered, a better quality version of the original mix, with recording techniques simply not available in 1994, as well as the advantage of crystal clear audio, and spatial separation of frequencies within the song, making it sound more dynamic.", "The duo's next release was based on Delta Heavy. The release was a Region 1 DVD of performance highlights, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage, Sasha & John Digweed present Delta Heavy, released on System Recordings.  Ben Turner, creator of the DanceStar awards, retrospectively described the Delta Heavy tour as \"a landmark moment for electronic music\".", "Though the duo of Sasha and Digweed never explicitly split up, demanding schedules and frequent independent touring prevented any substantial collaboration for a long period after Delta Heavy.", "Though frequent performing and other activities prevented them from working together for several years, Sasha and Digweed announced that they would reunite for a few Australian performances, starting in November 2006. The duo performed at several venues, including Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne as well as numerous tour dates which had followed throughout 2007.  In 2008, Sasha and Digweed started an American tour with a performance at the Winter Music Conference. The duo played at mainly larger venues on the weekends and smaller (750-1000 people) shows on weekdays.  Sasha described their music as \"driving and dark\" with \"a little throwback of Twilo sounds\".

One of the key figures of the house music scene at this time was a Birmingham promoter called Simon Raine, who took an interest in Tony's career. He put Tony on the bill alongside Fabio and Grooverider at 'The Institute' and encouraged him to make 'in roads' into other house parties as Tony had predominately played in the gay club scene. Raine had launched the successful  'Gatecrasher' club nights and, taking his advice, De Vit played at the 'Chuff Chuff' events sharing the bill with Sasha."]}, {"page": "Twilo", "response": ["Twilo usually kept at least one small room open most nights of the week, but the weekends were far busier. Friday nights saw a younger and alternative straight crowd. Twilo regularly featured prominent American and European DJs playing trance, techno, and house music. Sasha and John Digweed had a monthly residency at the club, playing the last Friday of every month. Early in 2001 after Sasha suffered an ear injury in a car accident and was unable to DJ, John Digweed played the entire 8 hour time slot by himself until the closing of the club in May. Other DJs would play frequently such as Paul van Dyk, Carl Cox, Robert Fauver, Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman), Danny Tenaglia, Merritt, Jeff Mills, Steve Lawler, Paul Oakenfold, Pete Marvelous, Pete Tong, DJ Dan, and Sven V\u00e4th.", "John Digweed, on his Transitions radio show on September 4, 2009, played an hour from one of his sets at Twilo from January, 2001. He's quoted as saying, \"I've dug into my vaults and I've found an hour from when I was playing at Twilo, that legendary club in New York City.  It was just under nine years ago that I recorded this set, and I've gotta say.. without a doubt.. my favorite club that I've ever played, in the world. Just unbelievable, those 5 years I've spent there alongside Sasha were just great, great time of my life, and the crowd that made those nights so special.\"  In the middle of the set Digweed is also quoted as saying: \"It's definitely one of those legendary clubs that if you didn't get a chance to go, it was definitely a shame, because the sound system, the setup, the lighting, and the whole vibe was truly amazing.\"", "Image:Twilo3.jpg |The fire trucks outside Twilo, March 30, 2001, Sasha & Digweed's 4th Year Anniversary", "Image:SashaDiggers 001.jpg|Sasha & John Digweed at the old DJ booth.", "Simon Noble & Rowan Blades collaborated to produce several tracks under the guise 'Breeder'.  One of these tracks, named after the club is called 'Twilo Thunder' (Twilo's sound system was known for its thunderous bass, as well as its crystal clear mids and highs.)  The system would sometimes produce bass rumbles which would mimic thunderstorms, hence the name Twilo Thunder.  According to Noble: \"As Breeder we tried to create peak-time progressive house floor-fillers, and our aim was to make them rock and be good enough so that Sasha and Digweed would play them. The first tunes we wrote were 'The Chain' and 'Twilo Thunder', we gave them directly to Sasha and John Digweed and for over a year, they played them around the world at clubs such as Twilo in New York and Tyrant in London.\" "]}, {"page": "Wipeout (video game series)", "response": ["The game also featured music from Propellerheads, and with The Chemical Brothers and Orbital, returning from the first Wipeout.
