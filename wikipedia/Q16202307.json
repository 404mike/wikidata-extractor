Here, Ajay finally relents and agrees to help Arya, but he also wants his dad, Yashvardhan's safety. Arya asks Ajay to attend the meeting in place of Vishal.  Ajay kills Inder, and when Inder's gang tries to kill Ajay, Arya's police team encounters all. Meanwhile, Arya has sent Vishal to the hospital to save Yashvardhan.
