He was educated at Abbey Grange High School in Leeds.Sharp succeeded the long-serving Steve Rhodes as Worcestershire Head Coach in 2018. \nHe had a fourteen-year first-class career playing for Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Griqualand West cricket team. He was a left-handed batsman and bowled right-arm off-spin.\nUnlike his contemporary David Gower, this curly haired left-handed batsman failed to do justice to his talent, and did not win the England cap predicted, after he scored 260* for England Young Cricketers in 1978.\nSharp made his first-class debut for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1976, and was awarded his cap in 1982. As well as Yorkshire, he spent three seasons with Griqualand West in South Africa between 1981 and 1984, playing seventeen first-class matches, and averaging just under 40.\nAfter finishing his Yorkshire first-class career in 1990, Sharp played for Shropshire in the Minor Counties from 1993 to 1997, while playing club cricket for Bridgnorth, and Ossett in Yorkshire.After retiring from the game he has worked as a batting coach for Yorkshire, and as an umpire. He was appointed as Head Coach of Worcestershire on 12 January 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| 3 || Kevin Sharp || 1978 || West Indies || England || 3 || 1 || 0 || 2", "| 2 || Kevin Sharp || 1977\u20131978 || 3 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "Kevin Sharp (disambiguation)", "response": ["Kevin Sharp (1970\u20132014) was an American country music singer.", "Kevin Sharp may also refer to:", "*Kevin Sharp (cricketer) (born 1959), English cricketer", "*Kevin Sharp (footballer) (born 1974), Canadian-born English footballer", "*Kevin Sharp, heavy metal/grindcore singer for Venomous Concept and Brutal Truth", "* Kevin Sharpe (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Ian Dews", "response": ["On 8 March 2007, Dews was confirmed as part of the Yorkshire first team management set-up.
