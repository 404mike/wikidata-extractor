From there, they went on to tours on the UK's circuit. The band recorded three demos during this time: Here Comes the Party, Para Todas las Putas Celosas, which translates as \"For all the jealous whores\", and The Fake Sound of Progress. These were produced by Stuart Richardson, who joined the band as bassist for the latter recording. Mike Lewis at this point switched to rhythm guitar. The Fake Sound of Progress also included the addition of DJ Stepzak, who would remain with the band for around a year.

This led to the band staging an intervention with Watkins, telling him that if he didn't clean up his act he would be fired.

Dissatisfied with this, the recordings were scrapped and the band approached Bob Rock (producer of Liberation Transmission) to produce the album in March 2008. However, Rock's hectic and unpredictable schedule, coupled with his scepticism that the songs were good enough to work on full-time, meant that they were not able to record with him until April or June 2009. The band also left their US record label, Columbia, also unconvinced of the quality of the new material, around this time, with Sony Music Entertainment taking over their actions in the American market. Faced with such adversity, Lostprophets decided to take control of the record back, with bassist Stuart Richardson (who had produced the band's demo EPs in the late 90s and the self-titled debut album for Attack! Attack! earlier in 2008) leading the production alongside Justin Hopfer for the album. They continued writing in 2008, debuting eventual first single \"It's Not the End of the World, But I Can See It from Here\" (a title that had been mentioned since August 2007, having been one of the first songs written for the new album in 2006) and \"Streets of Nowhere\" live, as well as a new version of \"Next Stop Atro City\".", "Stuart Richardson announced via Twitter that the album was totally finished on 26 July 2009. The website for the magazine Rock Sound subsequently revealed that the album had been delayed once more to early 2010, and that the first single is \"It's Not the End of the World, But I Can See It from Here\", due for release in October 2009. The title and several tracks were revealed in 5 August issue of Kerrang! magazine. \"It's Not the End of the World\" was played for the first time on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 19 August, where the release date was mentioned on 12 October. This was later confirmed on the band's website. On 7 October 2009, an email from the band's mailing list stated the album is to be released on 18 January 2010, and on 9 November XFM and BBC Radio 1 confirmed the second single as \"Where We Belong\", to be released a fortnight prior to the album. The third single from the album was \"For He's a Jolly Good Felon\", which was released on 12 April 2010.", "Since the album was first talked about in November 2006, Lostprophets have stated numerous times that the album would be \"darker\", \"more apocalyptic\", \"grittier\" and lyrically less optimistic and more cynical than their previous efforts. In August 2009, Stuart Richardson stated that this thematic change had been nurtured by the subsequent difficulties with \"behind the scenes bullshit\". Both Richardson and fellow band members Jamie Oliver and Mike Lewis stated that the new album would draw upon elements from across the band's three previous albums. Oliver considers the lyrical content of the album the main source of the \"dark element\", with vocalist and lyricist Ian Watkins having previously called the lyrics \"nasty\" and \"horrible\", displaying a \"more honest\" representation of his own character. Despite this, the album has still been described as \"poppy\" and \"catchy\", with the \"massive hooks\" the band are known for remaining. Like The Fake Sound of Progress and Start Something before it, The Betrayed features interludes between tracks. Several of the new songs performed live incorporated group singalong elements, with the audience encouraged to join in at live shows. \"For He's a Jolly Good Felon\" and \"Streets of Nowhere\" are \"Motown-y, mod type songs\", a style the band previously explored in \"Can't Catch Tomorrow (Good Shoes Won't Save You This Time)\". Inspiration for the new record has also been drawn from Faith No More and Refused, bands that inspired Lostprophets in the early days of their career. Similar to previous Lostprophets albums, the closing track uses instrumentation \"a little different\" to the band's usual style.", "* Stuart Richardson \u2013 bass guitar, production, recording, mixing"]}, {"page": "It's Not the End of the World, But I Can See It from Here", "response": ["* Stuart Richardson \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Stuart (name)", "response": ["*Stuart Richardson (born 1977), bassist for Lostprophets"]}, {"page": "The Betrayed Tour", "response": ["*Stuart Richardson \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Weapons (album)", "response": ["* Stuart Richardson \u2013 bass guitar, co-production, additional engineered"]}, {"page": "Bring 'Em Down", "response": ["* Stuart Richardson \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "We Bring an Arsenal", "response": ["* Stuart Richardson \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "No Devotion", "response": ["The band formed sometime in April 2014 only a few months after Lostprophets broke up.
