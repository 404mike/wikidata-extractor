Darwin turned up alive in December 2007, five years after he was believed to have died in a canoeing accident.\nDarwin was arrested and charged with fraud. His wife, Anne, was also arrested and charged for helping Darwin to collect his life insurance of \u00a3250,000. The fraudulent death also allowed the couple to pay off their \u00a3130,000 mortgage. In December 2007, after it was revealed the couple had been photographed together in Panama a year earlier, Anne confessed to knowing Darwin was alive and that he had been secretly living in their house and the house next door, which allowed him to get the insurance money illegally for his own personal gain. On 23 July 2008. John and Anne Darwin were each sentenced to more than six years in prison.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Jones", "response": ["*John Jones, alias used in the John Darwin disappearance case"]}, {"page": "List of premature obituaries", "response": ["* John Darwin: this British prison officer was presumed to have drowned in March 2002 when he disappeared while canoeing in the sea near Hartlepool. Despite a huge search operation, and the calm weather, only his paddle was found, followed weeks later by the wreckage of his canoe. An inquest declared him dead. However, in December 2007, Darwin walked into a London police station, announcing: \"I think I'm a missing person\", and claiming to have no memory of the past five years. Darwin's wife Anne, who had claimed his life insurance, says he turned up at their home in 2003 and lived in secret there and next door for three years. They also spent time together in Panama, where they planned to set up a hotel for canoeing holidays; she emigrated there shortly before Darwin reappeared. Both Darwin and his wife were subsequently convicted and imprisoned.See references in John Darwin disappearance case."]}, {"page": "Kathy Beale", "response": ["Taylforth reprised the role for a charity special in 2014. In the episode broadcast on 19 February 2015, the character made a surprise return to the serial - despite being presumed dead. It was confirmed that the character would be making a permanent return, and - after a guest appearance on 19 May 2015 - Kathy returned permanently on 17 August 2015. Taylforth was initially hesitant about her reintroduction storyline, which was inspired by the John Darwin disappearance case. Kathy's husband, Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas), was also introduced following her return and their turbulent marriage was explored. The character later had an affair with Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), and became critical in the events surrounding Max Branning's (Jake Wood) revenge campaign Albert Square - in light of the Who Killed Lucy Beale? saga - when James Willmott-Brown reappeared in his plan to recoup his relationship with Kathy by taking control of the square for her. Additionally, Kathy has had a brief relationship with Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and feuds with both Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) over the custody of her step-grandson Steven's daughter, Abi Jr.", "The character made an unannounced return during a live segment which aired on 19 February 2015 during EastEnders Live Week commemorating the 30th anniversary. Gillian Taylforth was initially hesitant about the storyline. \"I couldn't understand how they could work around the fact that she could do that to her children\" the actress explained. In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins said to the Daily Mirror that the story was inspired by the real life John Darwin disappearance case where John\u2014also known as the Canoe man\u2014with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance.

One of his most notable storylines included his battle with a gambling addiction, which led him losing his share in The Dog in the Pond public house, resulting in him being disowned by his family. Darren later helped his father, Jack (Jimmy McKenna), to fake his own death as part of a scam, which drew comparisons to the John Darwin disappearance case. Darren has been known for his multiple relationships, including Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring), a \"shotgun\" marriage to Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby), a brief affair with his mother-in-law Suzanne Ashworth (Suzanne Hall), two marriages to Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), an affair and subsequent relationship with Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) and his various relationships and brief affair with Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). Darren has three biological children: twins Jack and Francine (with Suzanne) and Oscar (with Nancy). He has also adopted Nancy's nephew Charlie Dean (Charlie Behan), who Nancy in turn adopted after her sister's death years prior.
