In the nineteenth century Charles Henry Timperley felt that the improved types were \"any thing but what the preamble of the patent would have us believe\" and Bigmore and Wyman considered it \"about as ugly a specimen of typography as can be conceived\". Goudy thought that the design was hampered by bad execution: \"little care had been taken to give to his new forms the same weight of stems as in the face into which they were interpolated\". Alastair Johnston felt that the type is \"anything but uniform and beautiful\" and that the new characters felt particularly uncomfortable in the word Egypt, where a large part of the novel is set: \"that word, with its three descending letters in an awkward huddle, pops up frequently.\""]}]}}
