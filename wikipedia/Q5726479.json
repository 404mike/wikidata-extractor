He started life as a clerk in the House of Commons Library, and joined the Great Northern Railway  (GNR) in the same capacity in 1850.  He was chief clerk in the Company Secretary's office until taking over as Secretary in 1858. He became General Manager of the company in 1870.\nHe proved adept at the politics and negotiations required in railway management, and had taken on an additional role as Honorary Secretary of the Railway Companies' Association by 1873. He retained these extra duties until the Association was restructured on a more permanent basis in 1900.\nOakley was elected to the GNR board in 1897 and retired as General Manager in 1898.
