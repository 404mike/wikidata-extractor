He started life as a clerk in the House of Commons Library, and joined the Great Northern Railway  (GNR) in the same capacity in 1850.  He was chief clerk in the Company Secretary's office until taking over as Secretary in 1858. He became General Manager of the company in 1870.\nHe proved adept at the politics and negotiations required in railway management, and had taken on an additional role as Honorary Secretary of the Railway Companies' Association by 1873. He retained these extra duties until the Association was restructured on a more permanent basis in 1900.\nOakley was elected to the GNR board in 1897 and retired as General Manager in 1898. In June 1900, a C1 class locomotive was named in his honour by the company; after its withdrawal from service in 1937 it was preserved, and survives at the National Railway Museum. After leaving the GNR he became Chairman of the Central London Railway, one of the new tube railways.\nIn 1891 he was dubbed Knight Bachelor at Osborne House, Isle of Wight.\nOakley died on 8 February 1912 at 37 Chester Terrace, St Pancras, London aged 88.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London, Brighton and South Coast Railway", "response": ["With the growth of traffic during the 1880s and early 1890s, the LB&SCR was the subject of press criticism for poor timekeeping and slow trains,Turner (1979), pp. 215\u201316. although it was never subjected to the levels of press and public obloquy accorded to the SER. One of the main reasons for poor timekeeping was the recurrence of congestion north of the SER station at Redhill as both companies sought to develop their outer London suburban services. This part of the line was owned by the SER, which (according to Acworth) gave its trains precedence through the junctions at Redhill,Acworth (1888), p. 97 but the LB&SCR paid an annual fee of \u00a314,000 for its use. Relations with the SER began to deteriorate once more and eventually both companies appointed Henry Oakley general manager of the Great Northern Railway as an independent assessor in 1889. Oakley supported the LB&SCR right to use the line but increased the annual payment to \u00a320,000.Turner (1977), pp. 112\u201313. However this did not solve the problem and an 1896 study of LB&SCR passenger services, by J. Pearson Pattinson described the  of shared track between Redhill and Stoats Nest (Coulsdon) as being 'in a state of the utmost congestion, and detentions of the Brighton expresses, blocked by South Eastern stopping trains, are as constant as irritating.'Ellis (1971), p. 172. quoting J. Pearson Pattinson, The London, Brighton & South Coast Railway, its Passenger Services, Rolling Stock, Locomotives, Gradients and Express Speeds, (Cassell, 1896)."]}, {"page": "Locomotives of the London and North Eastern Railway", "response": ["| C2 \"Klondyke\" Class || 4-4-2 || 990 || Henry Oakley || National Railway Museum || Static Exhibit"]}, {"page": "GNR Class C1 (small boiler)", "response": ["By the turn of the century, however, these single wheelers were being taxed by increasing train loadings on the East Coast Main Line. Seeking greater power and adhesion, Ivatt took the American route. He was not alone; his counterpart on the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, John Aspinall was also working on an Atlantic. Possibly to register a British first construction of the type, Ivatt's Atlantic was given a high priority by the GNR. Numbered No.990 and named Henry Oakley after the general manager of the railway, it was outshopped from Doncaster works in 1898, beating Aspinall's prototype by a few months.", "Only one of the small boiler C1 class has survived into preservation and it was the very first.
