(pp. 24\u201325) Mannin later stated that: \"His socialism went a great deal deeper than any politics or party policy; it was the authentic socialism of the Early Christians, the true communism of 'all things in common' utterly-and tragically-remote from Stalinism\". When at boarding school, following the outbreak of World War I, Mannin was asked to write an essay on \"Patriotism\". Hoping to impress her favourite teacher (a Communist sympathiser) Mannin's essay was an advocacy of anti-patriotic and anti-monarchist ideas. For writing the essay, Mannin's headmistress scolded her in front of the whole school and made her kneel in the school hall all afternoon. Mannin often mentioned this incident in her autobiographies as shaping her later politics.Andy Croft, \"Ethel Mannin: The Red Rose of Love and the Red Flower of Liberty\" in Angela Ingram and Daphne Patai, (ed.),Rediscovering Forgotten Radicals : British Women Writers, 1889-1939.Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1993.
