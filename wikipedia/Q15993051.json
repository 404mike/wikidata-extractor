The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (a fact which chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth) and Biggs was sent back to Brazil. In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation. The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.Daily Telegraph Obituary. Retrieved 3 May 2013 The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film, Biggs was played by Paul Freeman."]}, {"page": "Exeter School", "response": ["*Desmond Hamill, television journalist"]}, {"page": "Hamill", "response": ["*Desmond Hamill (1936\u20132013), British television reporter"]}, {"page": "Dave Currey (environmentalist)", "response": ["In 1989 Currey, using his considerable first-hand knowledge of the international ivory trade, took Desmond Hamill, senior foreign correspondent with Independent Television News (ITN), to Tanzania and the UAE. They filmed the ivory room in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and flew to Selous Game Reserve to film anti-poaching units in the field. In the UAE they confronted one of the ivory dealers, George Poon, outside his secret Ajman factory. The first time he had been filmed. ITN put together three News Specials broadcast on 10, 11 and 12 May 1989 which had a powerful impact on the public, the UK government and other organisations. This was the perfect launch to EIA's campaign for an ivory ban achieved later the same year after the release of an explosive report, by Currey and Thornton, packed with evidence of the international ivory trade: naming names, describing routes, quoting dealers from hidden recordings and blowing apart many of the pro-trade arguments with documented evidence."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Desmond Hamill, 76, television journalist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2013", "response": ["*Desmond Hamill, 76, British television news reporter.Desmond Hamill, British television news reporter, dies|telegraph.co.uk"]}]}}
