He was born in Calcutta where his father, the Danish naturalist Nathaniel Wallich, was Superintendent of the Royal Botanical Gardens. As a Surgeon-Major in the Indian Medical Service, he served 'during the Sutlej and Punjab campaigns, and also during the Santhal rebellion of 1855-56. He retired from the service in 1858.'  In 1860 he accompanied Sir Leopold M'Clintock aboard the Bulldog on a voyage across the North Atlantic to survey the sea-bottom for the laying of the proposed trans-Atlantic cable. He won the Linnean Medal in 1898 'in recognition of the valuable work accomplished by him in connection with the exploration of the fauna of the deep sea' (St James's Gazette, 16 April 1898). \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bathybius haeckelii", "response": ["Other scientists were less enthusiastic. George Charles Wallich claimed that Bathybius was a product of chemical disintegration.", "Huxley's rival George Charles Wallich claimed that Huxley had committed deliberate fraud and also accused Haeckel of falsifying data. Other opponents of evolution, including George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, tried to use the case as an argument against evolution. The entire affair was a blow to the evolutionary cause, who had posited it as their long-sought evolutionary origin of life from nonliving chemistry by natural processes, without the necessity of divine intervention. In retrospect, their error was in dismissing the necessary role of photosynthesis in supporting the entire food chain of life; and the corresponding requirement for sunlight, abundant at the surface, but absent on the ocean floor."]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1898: George Charles Wallich"]}, {"page": "Wallich", "response": ["* George Charles Wallich (1815\u20131899), a marine biologist and medical doctor; son of Nathaniel Wallich", "* Nathaniel Wallich (1786\u20131854), a botanist and surgeon; father of George Charles Wallich"]}, {"page": "Michael Pakenham Edgeworth", "response": ["But he was not always in India; he maintained a connection with scientific societies, being elected to the Linnean Society in 1842.
