Green", "response": ["Green studied at the University of Cambridge, where he attended lectures by Sydney Goldstein, Arthur Eddington and G. I. Taylor. In 1932 he attained a first in the first part of the Tripos examinations in mathematics and in 1934 was Wrangler in the second part. After his first very promising publications he was named the 1936 Fellow of Jesus College, received the 1936 Smith Prize, and in 1937 received his PhD under Taylor.His dissertation consists of two parts: Gliding problems in seaplane theory, The equilibrium and stability of a thin twisted strip.  With Taylor he published in the 1930s and 1940s a series of works on stress distribution in anisotropic plates. In 1939 Green became a lecturer at the University of Durham and then in 1948 a professor of applied mathematics at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne (at that time called King\u00b4s College of the University of Durham). In Newcastle he chaired the mathematical faculty with Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski and then alone after Rogosinki's retirement in 1959.
