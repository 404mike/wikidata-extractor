He was part of the Wales national football team between 1884 and 1893, playing 16 matches and scoring 5 goals. He played his first match on 17 March 1884 against England  and his last match on 8 April 1893 against Ireland. At club level he played for Chirk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Meredith", "response": ["Meredith made his debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892. The club played in The Combination, a league which contained a mixture of town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities. At the end of his first season Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final, which Chirk lost 2\u20131 to Wrexham. Meredith formed a solid understanding with inside-right William Owen, a former Wales international. Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners' strike. In an attempt to make ends meet, Meredith not only played for Chirk, but accepted an offer to play for Football League club Northwich Victoria as well, who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses. Northwich were a struggling side, who withdrew from the Football League at the end of the 1893\u201394 season after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The club won just three league matches; Meredith featured in each win. Back at Chirk, Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup. Meredith also played for Wrexham in 1894, sharing his talents between them, Chirk and Northwich Victoria that year."]}, {"page": "William Owen", "response": ["William Owen may refer to:", "*William Owen (Oxford MP) (c. 1540\u20131580), MP for Oxford", "*Sir William Owen (Shrewsbury MP), MP for Shrewsbury, 1625\u20131628", "*Sir William Owen, 4th Baronet (c. 1697\u20131781), British Member of Parliament for Pembroke and Pembrokeshire", "*William Owen (Australian politician) (1815\u20131869), businessman and politician in South Australia, prominent Total Abstainer", "*William Owen (Wisconsin politician, born 1825) (1825\u20131894), member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1862) (1862\u2013?), Chirk F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131945), footballer who played for Stoke", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1906) (1906\u2013?), English football goalkeeper with Birmingham, Fulham and Coventry City", "*William Owen (priest) (died 1680), Welsh Anglican priest", "*William Owen (Royal Navy officer, born 1737) (1737\u20131778), British Royal Navy officer and settler of Campobello Island, Canada", "*William Owen (painter) (1769\u20131825), British portrait painter", "*William Owen (composer) (1814\u20131893), Welsh composer of hymn tunes, including Bryn Calfaria", "*Sir William Owen (New South Wales judge)  (1834\u20131912), Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales", "*William Owen (trade unionist) (1844\u20131912), English trade unionist, journalist and political activist", "*William Owen (architect) (1846\u20131910), English architect", "*Sir William Owen (judge) (1899\u20131972), Justice of the High Court of Australia, grandson of Sir William Owen of the Supreme Court of New South Wales", "*William Owens (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Wales national football team results (1876\u20131899)", "response": ["|1884\u201385 British Home Championship|| Herbert Sisson (3), John Roach (2), William Owen, Tom Burke, Humphrey Jones || 1,500 ", "|1888\u201389 British Home Championship|| William Owen || 6,000 ", "|1889\u201390 British Home Championship|| William Pryce-Jones (2), William Owen, Dick Wilcock, David Lewis || 3,000 ", "|1890\u201391 British Home Championship|| Albert Davies, Jack Bowdler (2), William Owen || 6,000 ", "|1892\u201393 British Home Championship|| George Owen (2), William Owen || 3,000 "]}, {"page": "William Owen (footballer born 1862)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Owen (footballer, born 1862)"]}, {"page": "William Owen (footballer, born 1962)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Owen (footballer, born 1862)"]}, {"page": "William Owen (footballer, 1860 \u2013 1946)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Owen (footballer, born 1862)"]}, {"page": "William Owen (footballer, 1860 - 1946)", "response": ["#REDIRECT :William Owen (footballer, born 1862)"]}]}}
