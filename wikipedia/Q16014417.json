After a property developer bought the dock, he moved to a large minimalist studio in a former Jewish school in Stepney Green, east London, alongside the studios of Michael Kenny and Bert Irvin. The space taken by de Goede was formerly occupied by sculptor Hubert Dalwood. De Goede was an early pioneer of opening his studio to the public. He joined the London Group in 1996, when he was also a finalist for the Jerwood Prize. He was a founder member of the Movement for a Socialist Future (later merged into A World to Win) in 1999."]}, {"page": "Michael Kenny", "response": ["Michael Kenny may refer to:", "*Michael Kenny (boxer) (born 1964), New Zealand boxer", "*Michael Kenny (sculptor) (1941\u20131999), English sculptor", "*Michael Kenny (political scientist), professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge", "*Michael Kenny, character in Sister Kenny"]}, {"page": "City and Guilds of London Art School", "response": ["* Michael Kenny R.A.
