Led by Sir Kenneth Clark, director of the National Gallery, it employed artists to record the home front in Britain, running until 1943. It was motivated by a desire to record and reflect the landscape, already undergoing a period of rapid change through urbanisation and changes in agriculture and further threatened by bombing and other effects of war. Some of the sixty three artists directly commissioned included John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint, Charles Knight, Malvina Cheek, George Hooper, Clifford Ellis, Raymond Teague Cowern and Rowland Hilder. A further thirty four artists contributed to the final total of over 1500 works. The collection was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by the Trust in 1949. Over a hundred works comprising the \"Recording Scotland\" part of the same scheme are held at the Museum Collections Unit, University of St. Andrews."]}, {"page": "1915 in art", "response": ["* July 8 \u2013 Malvina Cheek, British artist (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "List of 20th-century women artists", "response": ["*Malvina Cheek (1915\u20132016), painter"]}, {"page": "List of centenarians (artists, painters and sculptors)", "response": ["|Malvina Cheek || 1915\u20132016 || 100 || British artist"]}, {"page": "War Artists' Advisory Committee", "response": ["* Malvina Cheek"]}, {"page": "Erlund Hudson", "response": ["Hudson was also a fine portrait painter, working mainly in watercolours and continued to exhibit in Britain, Scandinavia, Canada and the United States.
