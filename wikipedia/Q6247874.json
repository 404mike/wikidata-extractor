He was educated in the United Kingdom and the United States, with a PhD in sociology. After spending a year at Yale University in 1955\u20131956, he definitely moved to the US in 1962 to work with the architect Richard Buckminster Fuller on ecological issues and environmental sustainability.

Consequently, the stripes appear to both meld into and burst forth from the surrounding background. Also, the early black and white \"dazzle\" panels that John McHale installed at the This Is Tomorrow exhibit in 1956 and his Pandora series at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1962 demonstrate proto-op art tendencies. Martin Gardner featured op Art and its relation to mathematics in his July 1965 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.
