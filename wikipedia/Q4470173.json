Meanwhile, Burnel released an experimental solo album Euroman Cometh backed by a small UK tour and Cornwell recorded the album Nosferatu in collaboration with Robert Williams. Later that year the Stranglers released The Raven, which heralded a transition towards a more melodic and complex sound which appealed more to the album than the singles market. The songs on The Raven are multi-layered and musically complicated, and deal with such subjects as a Viking's lonely voyage, heroin addiction, genetic engineering, contemporary political events in Iran and Australia and extraterrestrial visitors, \"Meninblack\". The Raven saw a definite transition in the band's sound. The Hohner Cembalet \u2013 so prominent on the previous three albums \u2013 was dropped and Oberheim synthesizers used instead whilst acoustic piano was used on \"Don't Bring Harry\". A harmonizer was used to treat Burnel's vocal on the track \"Meninblack\", the recording of which led to Martin Rushent, who had produced their earlier albums, walking out leaving the band to co-produce the album themselves with Alan Winstanley.
