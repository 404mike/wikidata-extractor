She is a small, waiflike girl and, at first, Mildred thinks she will simply be a nuisance. However, Enid turns out to be a wild practical joker whose attempts to make Mildred like her, only result in getting Mildred into trouble. Overall she is friendly and kindhearted, but sometimes oversteps the mark in her attempt to befriend and help people. She takes an instant liking to Mildred and hopes to be her friend. She knows many spells and uses them regardless of the Witches' Code \u2013 i.e.: for selfish and trivial ends. Often her spells don't work as they are supposed to do, and her friends end up in deep water as a result. Enid made a guest appearance in Episode 10 of Weirdsister College, as the gothic and rebellious Enid. She flew in from her college to surprise Mildred, stating that she needed a break, but she was really expelled for over-partying. She tried to persuade Mildred to leave Weirdsister and go travelling around the world, but Mildred insisted on staying and finishing her training. Enid agreed and stated they would always remain friends, before departing. At the end of the episode \"Monkey Business\", she euphemistically indicates that schools are coming to an end in the real world."]}, {"page": "List of actors who have played Narnia characters", "response": ["|Jessica Fox (MN)Sallyanne Law (LB)"]}, {"page": "List of British former child actors", "response": ["*Jessica Fox (born 1983)"]}, {"page": "Ravi Roy", "response": ["Ravi is first seen when he begins to play with Charlie Dean (Joshua McConville).
