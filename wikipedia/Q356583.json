He began playing tenor saxophone in the 1950s with Tony Kinsey, Ted Heath, and Don Rendell. During his tenure with Rendell, he switched to baritone saxophone. He played at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958, and formed a group called the Jazz Makers with drummer Allan Ganley that same year. He toured the United States in 1959 and Europe later that year with the Modern Jazz Quartet. From 1961 to 1965 he played with Bill Le Sage, and later with Woody Herman, John Dankworth, Friedrich Gulda, and Clark Terry.\nRoss was a saxophone tutor for a young David Bowie, played baritone saxophone on The Beatles' White Album track, \"Savoy Truffle\", and years later was the baritone sax soloist on the Lou Reed song \"Walk on the Wild Side\", which was co-produced by Bowie. He also had guest appearances as a soloist on several Matt Bianco albums. The 2004 Matt Bianco album, Matt's Mood, contains three songs composed by band member Danny White, that were drawn from demos he and Ross recorded together \u2014 including the tribute song \"Ronnie's Samba\".He died, having been diagnosed with cancer, in London, in December 1991, aged 58.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Bowie", "response": ["Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a Grafton saxophone in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross. He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour, erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum (one iris a different colour to the other); his eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums."]}, {"page": "Lou Reed", "response": ["Reed's commercial breakthrough album, Transformer, was released in November 1972. Transformer was co-produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, and it introduced Reed to a wider audience, especially in the UK. The single \"Walk on the Wild Side\" was a salute to the misfits and hustlers who once surrounded Andy Warhol in the late '60s and appeared in his films. Each of the song's five verses describes a person who had been a fixture at The Factory during the mid-to-late 1960s: (1) Holly Woodlawn, (2) Candy Darling, (3) \"Little Joe\" Dallesandro, (4) \"Sugar Plum Fairy\" Joe Campbell and (5) Jackie Curtis. The song's transgressive lyrics evaded radio censorship. Though the jazzy arrangement (courtesy of bassist Herbie Flowers and saxophonist Ronnie Ross) was musically atypical for Reed, it eventually became his signature song. It came about as a result of a commission to compose a soundtrack to a theatrical adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel of the same name; the play failed to materialize. \"Walk on the Wild Side\" was Reed's only entry in the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, at No. 16."]}, {"page": "The Beatles (album)", "response": ["*Ronnie Ross and Bernard George\u00a0\u2013 baritone sax on \"Savoy Truffle\""]}, {"page": "Dolphin Square", "response": ["British jazz baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross released the jazz album Cleopatra's Needle (1968), containing its first track titled \"Dolphin Square\", which, according to the sleeve notes, was \"dedicated to a party at which Zoot Sims was present, once held in a flat there ('It must have been a good one, because I don't remember it')\"."]}, {"page": "Transformer (Lou Reed album)", "response": ["*Ronnie Ross\u00a0\u2013 soprano saxophone on \"Goodnight Ladies\"; baritone saxophone on \"Walk on the Wild Side\""]}, {"page": "The Perse School", "response": ["*Ronnie Ross, jazz musician"]}, {"page": "Matt Bianco", "response": ["With the addition of Mark Fisher, the sound changed considerably.
