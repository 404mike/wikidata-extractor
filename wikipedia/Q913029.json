Rather than ride in a line or a group, they fan out across the road with each rider taking a turn protecting the others before taking up shelter at the other side of the road. Several echelons can form at the same time and it is important to be in one and, preferably, the front one. A light rider like Gaul would be particularly vulnerable in a crosswind. while Gaul himself said the Dutch were \"too interested in their personal classification.\"Konrad, Gabor and Melanie (eds), Bikelore (2000), On The Wheel Publications (USA), , p80"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Brian Robinson"]}, {"page": "Frederick Thomas Bidlake", "response": ["The balance of the fund was used to create an annual award \u2013 the Bidlake Memorial Prize \u2013 for the most outstanding performance or contribution to cycling.
