For his autobiography, Half an Arch, he received the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography in 2005. He also wrote novels and children's literature.\nBorn in Edinburgh, he was brought up in London, and educated at Port Regis School, Bryanston and Cambridge.  As a boy, he was one of Benjamin Britten's favourites and he and his family provided the names for the characters in The Little Sweep.  His involvement with Britten is described in John Bridcut's Britten's Children.\nHe subsequently worked in advertising and publishing.\nHis grandfather was Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 3rd Earl of Cranbrook. His father was Surgeon-Commander Honorable Antony Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, fourth child of the third Earl. His mother was Ruth Elizabeth Thorowgood. Edward Gathorne-Hardy and Robert Gathorne-Hardy were his uncles, and his aunt was Lady Anne Hill, wife of George Heywood Hill, who together founded the Heywood Hill bookshop in Mayfair.He died at his home in Aldeburgh on 16 July 2019 at the age of 86.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Kinsey", "response": ["Kinsey's research went beyond theory and interview to include observation of and participation in sexual activity, sometimes involving co-workers. Kinsey justified this sexual experimentation as being necessary to gain the confidence of his research subjects. He encouraged his staff to do likewise, and to engage in a wide range of sexual activity, to the extent that they felt comfortable; he argued that this would help his interviewers understand the participants' responses. Kinsey filmed sexual acts which included co-workers in the attic of his home as part of his research; Biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy explains that this was done to ensure the films' secrecy, which would have caused a scandal had it become public knowledge. James H. Jones, author of Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life, and British psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple, among others, have speculated that Kinsey was driven by his own sexual needs."]}, {"page": "Charles Vaughan (priest)", "response": ["Harrow in the 1840s and 1850s had a schoolboy homosexual culture.

It was identified as \"an indispensable modern critique of psychoanalysis\" by Storr and \"the most comprehensive negative critique\" of Freud by professor of German language and literature Ritchie Robertson (who notes that it incorporates earlier critiques).

Masson argued that Webster was incorrect to claim that there is no evidence that any of Freud's patients had been sexually abused. He also criticized Webster's views on recovered memory, writing that they ignored relevant evidence.
