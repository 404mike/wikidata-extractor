He was a left-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire between 1985 and 1992.\nBrown made his debut Second XI Championship appearance in the 1982 season, playing for the team for three whole years before making a first County Championship appearance for his team in Derbyshire's lean 1985 season. In his second game at first class level he scored 74 against Warwickshire at Chesterfield. The next year, he played against a group of touring New Zealanders.\nIn 1987 Brown was released but before his departure helped Derbyshire secure the 2nd XI one day cup top scoring in the final against Hampshire at Southampton.\nBrown continued to score runs and forced his way back in to County cricket at the back end of the 1989 season, he hit a 65 in his first Championship match for three years and, when Derbyshire were going through their best batting spell for many years, in 1990, he hit his maiden first-class century against Northamptonshire, though he was to finish the match with a broken hand, administered by Curtly Ambrose. During the 1990 season Brown sustained a broken thumb after a promising start to the season and then the shattered knuckle during his 139 and averaged over 40 that season. The following season Derbyshire signed Mohammad Azharuddin and this spelled the end of Browns opportunities in 1991.\nThough he was released for the second time in 1992. \nIn 1997 Brown returned to Derbyshire as Second XI captain coach after impressing with his coaching abilities around the World in New Zealand and South Africa. He left the post to take up the role as Suffolk Head Coach which also included him playing for the county.\nDuring his tenure as Coach Suffolk had their best period of success winning the Eastern Division and culminating at Lord's in late 2007 with the winning of the One Day Cup.\nAfter these successes Brown once again returned to Derbyshire in 2008 as Head Coach alongside former teammate John Morris whom had taken on the role as Director of Cricket.\nBrown scored more runs for Derbyshire's second XI than any other batsman in history, a record which still stands today.\nAndy Brown currently coaches Ockbrook and Borrowash CC in Derbyshire", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Brown", "response": ["Andrew Brown may refer to:", "*Andrew Brown (CNN journalist), British-born journalist in Hong Kong", "*Andrew Brown (writer) (born 1955), British writer and journalist", "*Andrew Brown (Philadelphia Gazette) (c. 1744\u2013?), Irish soldier, journalist and congressional reporter", "*Andrew Brown (author), South African crime novelist", "*Andrew Brown (musician) (1900\u20131960), American jazz saxophonist", "*Andrew Brown (cricketer, born 1964), English cricketer", "*Andrew Brown (cricketer, born 1935) (1935\u20132020), former Scottish cricketer and Royal Navy sailor", "*Andrew Brown (outfielder) (born 1984), American baseball outfielder", "*Andrew Brown (pitcher) (born 1981), American baseball pitcher", "*Andrew Brown (rugby league) (born 1981), rugby league footballer for Scotland and Fife Lions", "*Andrew Brown (rugby union, born 20 April 1980), Welsh rugby union footballer", "*Andrew Brown (rugby union, born 10 April 1980), Australian rugby union footballer", "*Andrew Brown (soccer) (1870\u20131948), Scottish soccer coach", "*Andrew Brown (footballer) (c. 1860\u2013c. 1930), Scottish footballer", "*Andrew Brown (American football) (born 1995), American football defensive tackle", "*Andrew Brown (sailor) (born 1977), New Zealand sailor", "*Andrew Brown (minister) (1763\u20131834), Professor of Rhetoric, historian of Nova Scotia", "*Andrew Brown (media strategist) (born 1955), Scottish media strategist, former journalist and broadcaster", "*Andrew Brown (industrialist), industrialist and philanthropist, first European settler of the Lithgow Valley, New South Wales, Australia", "*Andrew Browne (disambiguation)", "*Killing of Andrew Brown Jr."]}]}}
