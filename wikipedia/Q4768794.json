He sold his Soho camera for \u00a335, and bought a new half-plate Kodak View monorail camera to which he attached his trusted Zeiss lenses. McBean was commissioned first by the Stratford Memorial Theatre to photograph a production of Anthony and Cleopatra, and all his former clients quickly returned. Through the late 1940s and 50s he was the official photographer at Stratford, the Royal Opera House, Sadler's Wells, Glyndebourne, the Old Vic and at all the productions of H. M. Tennent, servicing the theatrical, musical and ballet star system. (An example of his work in this genre from 1951 can be seen on the page about Anne Sharp, whom he photographed in a role in one of Benjamin Britten's operas.) Magazines such as The Sketch and Tatler and Bystander vied to commission McBean's new series of surreal portraits. In 1952 he photographed Pamela Green as Botticelli's Venus, with David Ball his boyfriend as Zephyrus."]}, {"page": "October 1916", "response": ["* Born: Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper, Dutch Holocaust survivor, one of the last people to see Anne Frank alive in the Auschwitz concentration camp, in Amsterdam (d. 2003); Anne Sharp, Scottish opera singer, best known for her collaborations with composer Benjamin Britten, in Motherwell, Scotland (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "Sharp (surname)", "response": ["* Anne Sharp (1916-2011), Scottish soprano"]}, {"page": "The Little Sweep", "response": ["|Anne Sharp"]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*25 August \u2013 Anne Sharp, opera singer (b. 1916)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2011", "response": ["*Anne Sharp, 94, Scottish coloratura soprano."]}, {"page": "2011 in classical music", "response": ["*August 25 \u2013 Anne Sharp, 94, Scottish coloratura soprano"]}, {"page": "Opera in Scotland", "response": ["* Anne Sharp"]}, {"page": "Anne Smellie Graham Sharp", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Sharp"]}]}}
