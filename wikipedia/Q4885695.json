Halifax Town. He is the son of former professional footballer, defender Paul Futcher.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Keith Alexander (footballer)", "response": ["Remaining at the club were former Tottenham Hotspur youngsters Alan Marriott and Peter Gain, Northern Ireland B international centre-back Paul Morgan along with midfielders Adam Buckley, Mark Camm and Ben Sedgemore and wing-backs Mark Bailey and Stuart Bimson and Alexander complemented their talents with a series of signings from outside of the Football League. After just one week in the job, Alexander completed his first two signings bringing Ben Futcher and Dene Cropper to the club on initial one-year contracts. One week later, Alexander made a second double swoop with Simon Weaver and Simon Yeo joining the ranks."]}, {"page": "Michael Reddy", "response": ["The 2005-06 campaign began with Grimsby firing on all cylinders. With Reddy the star in a strong team that never dropped out of the top 4 all season. His ability to run with the ball, make play, create and score goals earned him hero status amongst the club's supporters. His impressive partnership with new signing Gary Jones was arguably one of the best in the league. Between them, Reddy and Jones managed to find the net 31 times throughout the season. During the season, the club had a decent run in the League Cup defeating both Derby County and Tottenham Hotspur, before losing to Newcastle United. Michael was involved in all three games. Reddy's impressive performances had also earned him the right named in the League 2 Team of the Year. But in an unfortunate twist of fate, Reddy's season was cruelly interrupted by a hip injury in March and as a result the striker did not complete another ninety minutes for the remainder of the campaign. The Mariners faltered and fell out of the automatic promotion places on the penultimate day of the season. Reddy was deemed fit enough to take part in the play-off campaign, but it was goals from Gary Jones and Ben Futcher that defeated Lincoln City in the semi final stages. Slade opted to play Reddy from the start in the final at the Millennium Stadium against Cheltenham Town but luck fell against him as he was substituted with concussion after a clash of heads. Grimsby attempted to use Junior Mendes and Gary Cohen to help cater for Jones in attack, but without Reddy, the club went on to lose the game 1\u20130, ending all hopes of promotion after a promising season."]}, {"page": "Gareth McAuley", "response": ["However, when Dean West was dropped from the squad and club captain Paul Morgan sidelined with an injury, McAuley moved into central defence to partner Ben Futcher. He immediately drew the plaudits for his excellent performances, which included a man of the match display against Derby County. He thereafter battled for a starting centre back role with fellow giant Jamie McCombe for much of the season.", "The 2005\u201306 season, however, saw him cement a spot in the centre of the Imps defence. With Ben Futcher leaving on a free transfer to join rivals Boston United, McAuley took his place. He enjoyed a fantastic season, which culminated ultimately in play-off defeat for Lincoln again, but saw him named in the League Two Team of the Year, and also caught the attention of a number of bigger clubs."]}, {"page": "Paul Futcher", "response": ["Futcher was signed by Grimsby Town from Halifax Town reserves, aged 34,  by Alan Buckley for \u00a310,000 as a short term replacement for Andy Tillson.

Then his son Ben Futcher joined the club for their League Two play-off final season of 2005\u201306 before he left for Peterborough United."]}, {"page": "Chris Sedgwick", "response": ["On 10 July 2013, Sedgwick signed a one-year contract with League Two club Bury.

Fenton was joined at Blundell Park by Rovers teammate Ricky Ravenhill. He slotted in at centre half along with Justin Whittle, as the season progressed manager Rodger was replaced by Alan Buckley but he continued to feature as a regular. On the final day of the season he had the distinction of scoring the last ever goal at Shrewsbury Town's Gay Meadow stadium. During the 2007\u201308 season Fenton was a part of the Grimsby team that made it to the Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium, however the club were beaten 2\u20130 by the Milton Keynes Dons.
