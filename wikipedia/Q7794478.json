His father was the village blacksmith, a profession which Thomas and two of his brothers went in to. There is some doubt about his identity, but it is considered probably that this is the Thomas Tidy who made his only first-class appearance against the Gentlemen of the MCC during the 1868 Canterbury Cricket Week. He is known to have played in non-first-class matches for Southborough, Kent Colts and Sussex Colts and possibly also in the Gravesend area.Tidy married Mary Mann, a widow, at East Grinstead in 1877, the daughter of a family of inn keepers from Tunbridge Wells. By 1891 the couple were living at Brighton with Mary running The Eastern Hotel in the town. Tidy drowned in 1892 at Aldrington near Brighton with the circumstances of his death unknown.", "link_mentions": {}}}
