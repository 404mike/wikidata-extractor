He closely studied the emergence of yellow journalism in New York, as led by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer.  He realized that the money was to be made from not the cover price, which should be lowered to a halfpenny, but from advertisements. The advertisers wanted more and more readers--millions if possible--because they wanted to reach not only the entire middle class, but many well-paid members of the working-class. Harmsworth combined all the new technical innovations, with sensationalism, and a fixed goal of maximizing profits. Working with journalist Kennedy Jones, Harmsworth set up the  Evening News in 1894, and in 1896 launched the morning paper, the Daily Mail. J. Lee Thompson, Northcliffe: Press Baron in Politics, 1865\u20131922 (2000), pp. 22-32. The new formula was to maximize the readership using sensationalism, features, illustrations, and advertisements pitched to women for department stores offering the latest fashions. Harmsworth scored an immediate triumph. The first year daily sales averaged 200,000, and in three years it sold a half-million copies a day. The prestige press did not try to catch up, for they measured success not by sales or profits but on prestige and power they wielded by dominating the news needs of the upper class British elite.Ensor, England, 1870-1914 (1936) 310-16."]}, {"page": "Sylvan Debating Club", "response": ["* Kennedy Jones"]}]}}
