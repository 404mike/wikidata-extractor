Journalists Eamonn Mallie and Patrick Bishop state roughly 8,000 people passed through the ranks of the IRA in the first 20 years of its existence, many of them leaving after arrest, retirement or disillusionment. McGuinness, who held a variety of leadership positions, estimated a total membership of 10,000 over the course of the Troubles. The British Army estimates the IRA had 500 volunteers in July 1971, 130 in Derry and 340 in Belfast, journalist Ed Moloney states by the end of the year the IRA in Belfast had over 1,200 volunteers. After the late 1970s restructure, the British Army estimated the IRA had 500 full-time volunteers. A 1978 British Army report by Brigadier James Glover stated that the restructured IRA did not require the same number of volunteers as the early 1970s, and that a small number of volunteers could \"maintain a disproportionate level of violence\". Journalist Brendan O'Brien states by the late 1980s the IRA had roughly 300 active volunteers and 450 more in support roles, while historian Richard English states in 1988 the IRA was believed to have no more than thirty experienced gunmen and bombers, with a further twenty volunteers with less experience and 500 more in support roles. Moloney estimates in October 1996 the IRA had between 600 and 700 active volunteers."]}, {"page": "Royal Military Police", "response": ["* General Sir James Glover (1983\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff", "response": ["*1981 \u2013 1983 Lieutenant-General Sir James Glover "]}, {"page": "List of Old Wellingtonians", "response": ["*General Sir James Glover, Commander-in-Chief UK Land Forces 1985 to 1987"]}, {"page": "Glover (surname)", "response": ["*James Glover (British Army officer) (1929-2000)", "*James Glover (disambiguation), multiple people"]}, {"page": "Warrenpoint ambush", "response": ["The Warrenpoint ambush was a victory for the IRA.
