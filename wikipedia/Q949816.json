He broke the world record for the men's marathon four times in the 1950s. He was the first runner to complete a marathon in under 2 hours 20 minutes \u2013 an achievement which was equated to the breaking of the four-minute mile. He achieved this at the Polytechnic Marathon of 1953, a point-to-point race from Windsor to Chiswick, West-London. Later the same year Peters set the first sub-2:20 clocking on an out-and-back course, at the Enschede Marathon in the Netherlands.\nAt the 1954 Vancouver Commonwealth Games he reached the stadium in first place, 17 minutes ahead of the next runner and 10 minutes ahead of the record, but collapsed repeatedly and failed to finish. After covering just 200 metres in 11 minutes, he was stretchered away and never raced again. \"I was lucky not to have died that day\", he later said. His games kit, including plimsolls and the special medal which following the games the Duke of Edinburgh sent to Jim inscribed \"To a most gallant marathon runner.\" were given to the Sports Hall of Fame, Vancouver in 1967 for exhibition.\nHe served as president of the then recently formed Road Runners Club from 1955 - 1956. After retiring from competitive athletics, Peters worked as an optician in Mitcham, Surrey and Chadwell Heath, Essex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marathon world record progression", "response": ["| 2:20:42.2|| Jim Peters ||  || June 14, 1952 || Polytechnic Marathon || IAAF, ARRS || MarathonGuide.com states the course was slightly long.

Z\u00e1topek is the only person to win these three long-distance events in the same Olympic games. His victory in the 5,000 m came after a ferocious last lap in 57.5 seconds, during which he went from fourth place to first in the final turn, passing first Alain Mimoun of France, then Herbert Schade of West Germany, and finally Chris Chataway of Great Britain. Z\u00e1topek's final medal came when he decided at the last minute to compete in the marathon for the first time in his life, and won. His strategy for the marathon was simple: he raced alongside Jim Peters, the British world-record holder. After a punishing first fifteen kilometres, in which Peters knew he had overtaxed himself, Z\u00e1topek asked the Englishman what he thought of the race thus far. The astonished Peters told the Czech that the pace was \"too slow,\" in an attempt to slip up Z\u00e1topek, at which point Z\u00e1topek simply accelerated. Peters did not finish, while Z\u00e1topek won the race and set an Olympic record.
