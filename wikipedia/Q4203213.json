In a first season that Taylor admitted was difficult at times, the left winger played his way into first team contention at just the right time, being an unlikely deputy at right back due to an injury to Callum Driver at the back end of the season. Taylor went on to star in the club's National League South play off semi final games against Truro City, back in his more natural left wing position,  and scored a goal in the playoff final against Ebbsfleet United. The game ended 2\u20132 and Taylor was one of the Stones' successful penalty takers as the club beat the Fleet to the National League South promotion final trophy."]}, {"page": "Callum Charles John Driver", "response": ["#REDIRECT Callum Driver"]}]}}
