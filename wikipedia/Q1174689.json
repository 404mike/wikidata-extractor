Hatch's announcements were frequently lampooned or interrupted by other cast members.

David Hatch famously leaves the University of the Air during a Julius Caesar spoof lecture after Bill Oddie's flip remarks, only to be coaxed back with offers of rhubarb tart. It is also Angus Prune's favourite dish. In the \"Ali Baba\" sketch in the 3rd series, Cleese appears as Omar Khayyam; he remarks to Ali Baba, played by Brooke-Taylor, \"Surely you've heard of the Rhubarb Tart of Omar Khayyam?\" There were also two \"Rhubarb Tart\" songs, one sung by Cleese, which he also sang in At Last the 1948 Show, and one sung by Oddie, which became \"The Custard Pie Song\" in the TV series The Goodies.", "* Beethoven's Fifth. The famous opening bars of this piece of music are constantly used in the series, usually in inappropriate settings; their first appearance was in the first sketch of the pilot programme in 1963, and during an Opportunity Knocks spoof in the 3rd series Bill Oddie tries to tap-dance to them in what sound like hob-nailed boots. David Hatch once introduced the cast: \"...with another of their sallies forth \u2013 (GRAMS: 'Da-da-da-dummmmm') \u2013 or Beethoven's Fifth \u2013\" On another occasion, the pre-show teaser was Beethoven, played by Brooke-Taylor, trying to get Bill Oddie, playing a stereotypically Jewish-sounding music publisher, to market the tune.  After hearing the tune, Oddie says: \"That's a load of old rubbish!\" and then twists the melody to form the opening sig. The closing bars of the final movement of the symphony were used to introduce a 'promenade concert' that featured \"There was a Ship that put to Sea all in the Month of May\" \u2013 Hatch says solemnly in his best BBC voice: \"That was the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler.
