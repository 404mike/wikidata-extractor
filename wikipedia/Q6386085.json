Although he was often played at centre-half, he was more at home at right-half; he was primarily a \"destructive\" rather than \"constructive\" player who \"appeared to be rather slow (although) he had an easy stride\" and was \"reliable and a great trier\" but \"tended to be over-awed in important matches\". For the 1905\u201306 season, he became a regular in defence alongside England internationals Bert Lee and Kelly Houlker. In his first season at The Dell, Hogg made 24 league and 5 FA Cup appearances, scoring once, as Southampton finished as runners-up in the League."]}, {"page": "Bill Gray (footballer)", "response": ["Gray was born in Inverness and began his youth career with local club Inverness Thistle.

Although Rovers lost 3\u20132, Wilson scored their first goal with a header from a corner and, according to the Athletic News \"Busy Bee\", \"was a trifle ungainly, but he promises to develop into a good player\". He kept his place for the next two matches and then returned to the reserves. Early in the 1906\u201307 season, England international centre-half Kelly Houlker dislocated a kneecap, which gave Wilson a chance to establish himself in the team. By the end of November, the Athletic News had concluded that he was \"fast developing into a really capable centre half-back\": deceptively quick \"by reason of his length of limb\", a \"splendid tackler\", and particularly skilled at feeding the ball to his forwards. Wilson finished the season with 29 First Division appearances, but was not first choice for 1907\u201308, playing only 10 matches in the middle of the season."]}]}}
