The Throckmortons were a prominent  Roman Catholic family, who continued to hear mass at the family home Coughton Court, Alcester, Warwickshire. In 1826 the family estate at Molland in Devon devolved to Throckmorton when his uncle succeeded to the baronetcy. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 allowed Catholics to hold national office for the first time in almost three hundred years.Throckmorton took advantage of the change in the law to become one of the first Catholic MPs after Daniel O'Connell achieved the feat in 1828 and eventually had Catholic Emancipation signed into law. At the 1831 general election he was elected MP  for Berkshire, the location of his third country estate, Buckland Park (though it is now in Oxfordshire). He held the seat until 1835.  He also became a JP and Deputy Lieutenant for Berkshire. He was High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1843.\nThrockmorton inherited the baronetcy in 1840 on the death of his uncle Sir Charles Throckmorton, 7th Baronet. He built a new Catholic church at the end of the south drive of Coughton Court, next to  the ruins of the church built by an earlier Throckmorton in the 15th century which was confiscated from the family during the Reformation.Throckmorton  died at the age of 61.\nThrockmorton married Elizabeth Acton, daughter of Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet of Aldenham on 16 July 1829.", "link_mentions": {}}}
