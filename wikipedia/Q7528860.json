The Throckmortons were a prominent  Roman Catholic family, who continued to hear mass at the family home Coughton Court, Alcester, Warwickshire. In 1826 the family estate at Molland in Devon devolved to Throckmorton when his uncle succeeded to the baronetcy. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 allowed Catholics to hold national office for the first time in almost three hundred years.Throckmorton took advantage of the change in the law to become one of the first Catholic MPs after Daniel O'Connell achieved the feat in 1828 and eventually had Catholic Emancipation signed into law. At the 1831 general election he was elected MP  for Berkshire, the location of his third country estate, Buckland Park (though it is now in Oxfordshire). He held the seat until 1835.  He also became a JP and Deputy Lieutenant for Berkshire. He was High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1843.\nThrockmorton inherited the baronetcy in 1840 on the death of his uncle Sir Charles Throckmorton, 7th Baronet. He built a new Catholic church at the end of the south drive of Coughton Court, next to  the ruins of the church built by an earlier Throckmorton in the 15th century which was confiscated from the family during the Reformation.Throckmorton  died at the age of 61.\nThrockmorton married Elizabeth Acton, daughter of Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet of Aldenham on 16 July 1829.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet", "response": ["*Elizabeth Acton (1806\u20131850), who married Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, of Coughton Court, Warwickshire, and had issue."]}, {"page": "Robert George Throckmorton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet"]}, {"page": "Robert Throckmorton (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet (1800\u20131862)"]}, {"page": "St Peter and St Paul and St Elizabeth Catholic Church, Coughton", "response": ["St Peter and St Paul and St Elizabeth Catholic Church is a Catholic church built between 1851 and 1853 by the Throckmorton family in the grounds of their family home, Coughton Court. The church was commissioned by Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, in the years after the Catholic Emancipation Acts which would re-allow the profession of the Catholic faith officially for the first time since the Tudor period. The church currently holds Grade II listed status.", "The Throckmorton family had remained Catholic even after the formation of the Church of England and the break from Rome in the 1530s starting with the Act of Supremacy in 1534. The family had remained recusant Catholics, celebrating Mass in the saloon of Coughton Court, which acted as a chapel.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558, ed. S.T. Bindoff, 1982. Article: THROCKMORTON, Sir George (by 1489-1552), of Coughton, Warws. Evidence of this recusancy are still evident in the house today. A double priest hole is present in the tower of the house, elucidating the role the house played in the celebration of the Catholic faith in this period. After the move towards Catholic emancipation, Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, commissioned the building of a new church on the grounds, after the original church on the estate had been re-dedicated to the Anglican faith. This was done to celebrate the new found freedoms for Catholics in Britain which included the ability to build non-Anglican places of worship in Britain.", "The church was commissioned by Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, in the 1850s. This followed the movement towards Catholic emancipation in Britain after the ending of discriminatory rules and laws against Catholics. The house was built with an accompanying presbytery. The Catholic architect Charles Hansom was chosen to design the church. He was the brother of J A Hansom, designer of the Hansom cabs. Hansom designed the church with a notably thin tower, which is based upon Irish church architecture. The original plans for the church are held with the Throckmorton papers in the Warwickshire Record Office. Stone for the church was quarried from the Throckmorton's estates. The church was only formally opened in 1857 to be used by the family and other Catholics within the area."]}]}}
