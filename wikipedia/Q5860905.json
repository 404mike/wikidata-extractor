She gained recognition for her roles in the comedy series The Book Group (2002\u20132003), Green Wing (2004\u20132007), and Bad Education (2012\u20132013). She went on to appear as Missy in the long-running British science fiction series Doctor Who (2014\u20132017), for which she was nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actress.\nGomez received further recognition and acclaim for her roles as Lilith / Madam Satan and Mary Wardwell in the Netflix supernatural horror series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (2018\u20132020) and as Miranda Croft in the HBO Max dark comedy thriller series The Flight Attendant (2020).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doctor Who", "response": ["Although the idea of casting a woman as the Doctor had been suggested by the show's writers several times, including by Newman in 1986 and Davies in 2008, until 2017, all official depictions were played by men. Jodie Whittaker took over the role as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, and is the first woman to be cast as the character. Whittaker had previously starred in television series such as Return to Cranford,  Broadchurch alongside David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) and the dystopian anthology Black Mirror. The show introduced the Time Lords' ability to change sex on regeneration in earlier episodes, first in dialogue, then with Michelle Gomez's version of The Master.", "Following the series revival in 2005, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode \"Utopia\". During that story, the role was then assumed by John Simm who returned to the role multiple times through the Tenth Doctor's tenure. As of the 2014 episode \"Dark Water\", it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or \"Time Lady\", going by the name of \"Missy\" (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of \"Master\"). This incarnation is played by Michelle Gomez. Simm returned to his role as the Master alongside Gomez in the tenth series. The Master returned for the 2020 twelfth series with Sacha Dhawan in the role. The character had dubbed himself the \"Spy Master\" referencing a role he had taken with MI6.", "The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005\u20132010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor and in 2016, Michelle Gomez became the first female to receive a BAFTA nomination for the series, getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work as Missy."]}, {"page": "Clan McDuck", "response": ["A picture of Matilda appears in the 2017 DuckTales series pilot episode, \"Woo-oo!\", as part of Webby's research on Scrooge's family.

Salem Saberhagen also appears in the series."]}, {"page": "The Master (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The Master was originally played by Roger Delgado from 1971 until his death in 1973. The role was subsequently played by Peter Pratt, Geoffrey Beevers, and Anthony Ainley, with Ainley reprising the role regularly through the 1980s until the series was cancelled in 1989. Eric Roberts took on the role for the 1996 Doctor Who TV film. Since the show's revival in 2005, The Master has been portrayed by Derek Jacobi, John Simm, Michelle Gomez, and Sacha Dhawan. Gomez portrayed the first female incarnation of The Master, known as Missy. The Master returned in 2020 in the two-part episode Spyfall, portrayed by Dhawan, who is the youngest actor to play the role.", "The Master returns in the eighth series as a new female incarnation called \"Missy\" (Michelle Gomez), which is short for \"Mistress\". The Master's return is seeded in the series 7 episode \"The Bells of Saint John\" (2013), when a \"woman in the shop\" brings Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) and the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) together by giving Clara the telephone number to The Doctor's TARDIS. This plot thread is picked up on again in \"Deep Breath\" (2014); the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) and Clara realise that a woman has been scheming to keep the two together. Missy is shown observing the pair from a world she refers to as 'Heaven', speaking to recently deceased individuals The Doctor encountered throughout the series.", "On 6 April 2017, the BBC confirmed that Simm would be returning as The Master in the tenth series, appearing alongside his successor in the role, Michelle Gomez, for the first multi-Master story in the programme's history. Previously, there have been multi-Master stories in audio dramas, books, and comics. The series would also be Gomez' last.", "Michelle Gomez maintained Simm's portrayal of the character, specifically the psychopathic behaviour and inappropriate emotional responses to certain situations. She also portrayed the original traditions of ruthless, murderous behaviour and grandiose, Machiavellian criminal intelligence that have been consistent throughout all incarnations. However, she also displayed a much more coquettish manner, with her new female identity allowing her to fully express aspects of The Master's ambiguous bond with The Doctor (as previously explored by Simm's incarnation in \"The Sound of Drums\"). While determined to torment and corrupt The Doctor with moral temptation while inflicting pain and death to humanity, she frequently referred to him as her \"boyfriend\" or \"friend\" and appeared to desire his acquiescence and company ultimately. She is also well aware that she is even more dangerously psychopathic than before, describing herself as \"Bananas\" to UNIT agent Osgood right before killing her (\"Death in Heaven\"). However, when circumstances result in Missy being kept in a vault and monitored by The Doctor after an averted execution, Missy actually comes to show signs of remorse for what she had done in the past, to the point that she prepares to side with The Doctor over her own past self (\"The Doctor Falls\").", "The Master has made regular appearances in various audio plays produced by Big Finish. Geoffrey Beevers, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Gomez, Eric Roberts and John Simm have all reprised the role from the television series. While Mark Gatiss, Alex Macqueen, Gina McKee and Milo Parker portray versions of the Master original to Big Finish. Jon Culshaw has performed as the Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley incarnations of the Master.", "In May 2018, it was announced that the fifth series of The Diary of River Song would feature the title character, River Song, encountering four incarnations of the Master. As well as Beevers and Jacobi returning, this release saw Eric Roberts and Michelle Gomez make their Big Finish debuts as their incarnations of the Master. This release explains how the Master (Roberts) was able to escape the Eye of Harmony, stuck in the time vortex until River's intervention enables him to escape back into the universe.", "Like Jacobi, Michelle Gomez also performs her incarnation of the Master (renamed Missy) for an ongoing audio series. Missy premiered in February 2019 and featured The Monk played by Rufus Hound. The second series introduced a character known as The Lumiat \u2013 revealed to be the next incarnation of The Master, the immediate successor to Missy \u2013 played by Gina McKee. It is explained that, after her \"poetic\" death at the hands of her predecessor, Missy used an Elysian field to transfer her consciousness into a duplicate body created from her own dying cells and trigger regeneration. Motivated by her recent attempt at redemption, she edited the duplicate to remove all the negative aspects of her personality and became a benevolent force in the universe, adopting the title Lumiat. Missy encounters the Lumiat trying to undo some of her earlier incarnation's evil deeds. Sickened by her future self, Missy kills the Lumiat with a TCE and abandons her to regenerate, implying the process might cause them to return to evil. In the third volume, Gomez and Hound were joined by Gemma Whelan as the Meddling Nun \u2013 another incarnation of the Monk."]}, {"page": "Cyberman", "response": ["In the two-part finale of the 2014 series, \"Dark Water\" and \"Death in Heaven\", the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) learns too late that the Cybermen have formed an alliance with a female incarnation of the Master, Missy (Michelle Gomez), who is converting the stolen bodies of the dead into an army. A cyberconversion process begins on all of Earth's dead. Missy offers the Doctor control of the Cybermen army so they can rule the universe together, but her plan is foiled when Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson), the cyber-converted boyfriend of the Doctor's companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), resists his programming and destroys himself along with all the other Cybermen. Cybermen are next seen in \"Face the Raven\" (2015), among the various alien refugees hiding in London, and in series finale \"Hell Bent\", in which a rusted Cyberman is imprisoned in the Cloisters of Gallifrey. The origin of the Cybermen of Mondas is told in the two-part Series 10 finale \"World Enough and Time\" and \"The Doctor Falls\", when a Mondasian colony ship is stuck escaping the gravity of a black hole for many years. The human-like Mondasians, assisted unknowingly by the Master (John Simm), begin upgrading their population to adapt to life aboard the decaying ship. The Doctor reflects on all the societies that have created Cybermen and concludes that the Cybermen is an example of parallel evolution: a concept that is waiting to impose itself on human-like species across the universe. Ultimately, this encounter with the Cybermen proves brutal: the Doctor's companion Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) is cyberconverted; two incarnations of the Master (Simm and Gomez) kill one another in a disagreement over standing alongside the Doctor; and the Doctor's companion Nardole (Matt Lucas) is left behind on the ship to look after human colonists, for whom inevitable cyberconversion has been delayed but not averted, though the Doctor manages to destroy most of the Cybermen in a massive explosion. The Doctor, exhausted and wounded to a point of nearing death, awakens in his TARDIS and begins to regenerate. At the same time, the cyberconverted Bill is saved by her old flame Heather who turns her into the same sort of being Heather became after being infected by a sentient liquid."]}, {"page": "List of Doctor Who supporting characters", "response": ["*The Master (Roger Delgado, Peter Pratt, Geoffrey Beevers, Anthony Ainley, Gordon Tipple, Eric Roberts, Derek Jacobi, John Simm, William Hughes, Michelle Gomez, Sacha Dhawan)"]}, {"page": "Jack Davenport", "response": ["Davenport married actress Michelle Gomez on 1 May 2000.

For example, in The Gunfighters the Doctor assumes the name of Doctor Caligari and subsequently responds to the question \"Doctor who?\" with \"yes, quite right\". In the serial The War Machines, the computer WOTAN commands that \"Doctor Who is required\", and his human agents also use the name. The Third Doctor's car, dubbed \"Bessie\", carried the plate WHO 1, the only ongoing reference to the \"Doctor Who\" enigma in the original programme. The Third Doctor later drove an outlandish vehicle called the \"Whomobile\" in publicity materials, but it is never referred to as such in the programme, being simply known as \"the Doctor's car\" or \"my car\", as the Doctor puts it. The name \"Doctor Who\" is used in the title of the serial Doctor Who and the Silurians, but this was a captioning error rather than an in-story mention. The only other time this occurs is in the title of episode five of The Chase, which is titled \"The Death of Doctor Who\". In \"World Enough and Time\" (2017), the Doctor's old friend and archenemy the Master (Michelle Gomez) insists that the Doctor's real name is in fact Doctor Who, and that he chose it himself, though he tries to reassure his companion that she is joking, although later in the episode self-identifies by that name."]}, {"page": "Dean Cavanagh", "response": ["Cavanagh works regularly with Irvine Welsh.
