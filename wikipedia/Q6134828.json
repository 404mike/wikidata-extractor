While there he was visited by artists including Thomas Seddon and William Holman Hunt, both of whom seem to have used his photographs as reference material for their paintings.When he exhibited photographs, he would often write an appropriate quotation from the Bible on the mount.During his time in Jerusalem he taught photography to the Russian-born Mendel John Diness, who had been converted from Judaism, and baptised in 1849 by the British consul James Finn.He was the author of a pamphlet called Jerusalem; its Missions, Schools, Converts etc. under Bishop Gobat published in London in 1858.", "link_mentions": {}}}
