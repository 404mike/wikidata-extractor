Three days later, he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu as Luton took Premier League club Stoke City to a penalty shoot-out in a League Cup second round fixture, only to lose 8\u20137 on penalties after the match ended 1\u20131 after extra-time. During a 2\u20131 home defeat to Plymouth Argyle on 24 October 2015, Hall received two yellow cards within a couple of minutes of each other and was subsequently sent off. However, this caused some confusion because it wasn't made clear in the aftermath of the first incident that Hall had been a shown a yellow card, thus he wasn't expecting a subsequent red card following the second incident. This led to an apology from the Football Association after Luton sought clarification from both them and the referee which determined that the referee did not make it clear who received the yellow card in the first incident, but Hall would still be suspended for the next fixture against Dagenham & Redbridge. Hall's next appearance was during a 4\u20133 home defeat to Northampton Town, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute for Sean Long, a result which led to the sacking of manager John Still. He featured twice under caretaker manager Andy Awford, in a 0\u20130 draw with Portsmouth on 28 December 2015, followed by a 2\u20130 away defeat to Bristol Rovers five days later. Hall also featured in the first match under new Luton manager Nathan Jones, a 0\u20130 draw with Cambridge United two weeks later, but went off with a foot injury after 65 minutes and was replaced by Paddy McCourt. He returned to the matchday squad for a home fixture against Hartlepool United on 20 February 2016, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Alex Lawless during a 2\u20131 win. However, a succession of injuries ruled him out for the rest of the season, after which Luton announced he would be released upon the expiry of his contract, a decision manager Nathan Jones described as 'logical' as a result of missing a significant amount of training and a lack of game time."]}, {"page": "John Still (footballer)", "response": ["He has won praise for his man-management and talent spotting skills, especially his ability to discover young players in non-League football at the sixth tier and below, develop them and then sell them \u2013 often for a significant profit. Players that Still has developed that have gone on to play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle. Dagenham & Redbridge managing director Steve Thompson has stated that Still's ability to do this kept the club consistently able to compete while operating on a far smaller budget than its rivals. Still's reputation for nurturing talent, combined with his vast array of contacts within the game gained through decades of coaching, have also led to highly rated young players from Premier League academies joining his teams on loan. Examples include Marlon Pack and Matt Ritchie at Dagenham, and Cameron McGeehan, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu and Elliot Lee at Luton."]}, {"page": "Pelly", "response": ["*Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu (born 1993), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Finchley Catholic High School", "response": ["* Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Professional footballer for Luton Town"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["On 28 November, injuries to defenders Anthony Charles, Alex Lacey, Andy Parry and Steve McNulty, coupled with the impending closure of the loan transfer window, saw the club act to sign three defenders on loan: Joe Davis arrived from Port Vale, Alfie Mawson from Brentford, and Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, who was also able to play in midfield, from West Ham United. In addition, midfielders JJ O'Donnell and Jim Stevenson, who had featured in only a handful of games, were sent on loan to Hyde and Dartford respectively. All five loans were agreed until 4 January.

Luke Guttridge and substitute Jake Howells scored two apiece, with goals also coming from Paul Benson and a first for the club by full-back Scott Griffiths.

Transfer-listed striker Scott Rendell mutually agreed for his contract to be terminated on 30 January, and he later joined Woking.
