He served as premier of South Australia from 1910 to 1912, the second member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to hold the position.\nVerran was born in Cornwall and arrived in Australia as a young child. He began working in the copper mines at Moonta as a young boy and  eventually became president of the local miners' union. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly in 1901 as a member of the United Labor Party, the predecessor of the current ALP. Verran was chosen as the party's leader in 1909, following the death of Thomas Price, and won a majority at the 1910 state election. His agenda was hampered by the obstructionist Legislative Council and  the government was defeated in 1912. He resigned as leader in 1913 and left the party following the split of 1916, losing his seat in 1918. After several unsuccessful candidacies for non-Labor parties he was chosen to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate from 1927 to 1928, sitting as a Nationalist.", "link_mentions": {}}}
