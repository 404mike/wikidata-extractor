After the deaths in quick succession of his father C. P. Scott and brother Edward, and consequent threat of death duties, John Scott wished to prevent future death duties forcing the closure or sale of the newspapers, and to protect the liberal editorial line of the Guardian from interference by future proprietors. The first and only Chairman of the first Trust was John Scott."]}, {"page": "Manchester Evening News", "response": ["With his Parliamentary bid unsuccessful, Henry lost interest in the business, selling the publication to John Edward Taylor Jr., the son of newspaper proprietor John Edward Taylor, founder of the Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian). The newspaper became the evening counterpart and sister title to The Manchester Guardian and the two titles began sharing an office, located on Cross Street, from 1879. Taylor brought his brother-in-law Peter Allen in as a partner in the Manchester Evening News and, after Taylor's death in 1907, the Guardian was sold to its editor C. P. Scott while the Evening News passed into the hands of the Allen family. In 1924, C. P. Scott's son John Russell Scott reunited the papers, buying out the Manchester Evening News and forming The Manchester Guardian and Evening News Ltd, which in turn later became the Guardian Media Group (GMG).", "In 1936, John Russell Scott formed the Scott Trust in order to protect the company from death duties, following the deaths of his father and younger brother Ted in close succession.

Charles handed over the editorship to his son, Richard's father, Ted in 1929.  Just three years later, and only months after inheriting half of the newspaper on Charles' death, tragedy struck when Ted drowned while boating with Richard on Windermere.  Richard had been schooled at Gresham's School, Norfolk, and, with the financial support of Ted's brother John Russell Scott, he matriculated to Christ's College, Cambridge later that same year, 1932.  Ted's shares in the newspaper had gone to John who, in 1936 orchestrated their conversion into a trust to avoid inheritance taxes.  Hence, Richard was never more than momentarily an owner of the paper."]}]}}
