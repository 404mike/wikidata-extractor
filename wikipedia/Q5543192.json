In 1985, the left wing won control of the CLP at the AGM. Hughes had not been particularly prominent in the period leading up to this, but he came out of political semi-retirement as an \"elder statesman\" figure to become CLP chair. A few weeks later the sitting MP, George Park, announced his intention to retire at the next election, if he had not done so there would probably have been an attempt to deselect him. The CLP then went into the procedure for selecting a parliamentary candidate. At the selection meeting the right wing voted for Hughes as he seemed the weakest of the left-wing candidates, mainly because he was aged 60 and so might only serve one term as an MP."]}, {"page": "Charles Petty-Fitzmaurice, 9th Marquess of Lansdowne", "response": ["At the 1979 general election, he contested Coventry North East for the Conservatives, coming second behind Labour's George Park."]}, {"page": "George MacLean Park", "response": ["#REDIRECTGeorge Park (politician) "]}, {"page": "George Park", "response": ["George Park may refer to:", "* George Park (politician) (1914\u20131994), British Labour Party politician", "* George Park (swimmer), Canadian swimmer"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|George Park"]}]}}
