(1885\u20131970)", "response": ["Luton Town Football Club is an English professional football club based in the town of Luton, Bedfordshire. Founded in 1885, Luton Town were the first professional team in the south of England, fully professional by 1891. Luton were also one of the first southern Football League clubs, joining in 1897 before leaving again in 1900 due to financial instability. The club rejoined the League for the 1920\u201321 season. George Thompson became the club's first manager four years later, but only lasted eight months before leaving, and wasn't replaced until 1927. 1936\u201337 saw Luton promoted to the Second Division, and the first post-war seasons saw a strong Luton team begin to emerge. Record goalscorer Gordon Turner's arrival into the first team in 1950 helped Luton to promotion to the First Division for the first time in 1954\u201355, and the team remained there until relegation in the 1959\u201360 season. Luton also reached the 1959 FA Cup Final, where Turner's absence and the team's questionable preparation for the game meant that Luton lost 2\u20131 to Nottingham Forest. The club was subsequently relegated three times in six seasons, reaching the Fourth Division by 1965\u201366. However, players such as Malcolm Macdonald ensured that the club was then promoted twice in three years and was back in the Second Division by 1970.", "The Football League resumed in 1946\u201347 \u2013 Martin, who had been promoted to manager in 1944, brought in Dally Duncan, a former Scottish international, as player-coach. Martin moved to Newcastle United at the end of an inconsistent season, and in his place Duncan was promoted to manager. The next four seasons were a transitional period in which ageing pre-war players were gradually replaced by a younger generation, often by means of unpopular sales of the best talents: Hugh Billington, Frank Soo, Billy Hughes and Bob Brennan were all sold for big fees. In their place came the new breed of Luton player \u2013 South African forward Billy Arnison became a crowd favourite before injury forced him to return home, and home-grown talent such as Bob Morton and Gordon Turner saw a new Luton line-up start to emerge.", "After a large financial loss and declining attendances, optimism was not high at the start of the 1951\u201352 season. However, performances were boosted by the debut of Gordon Turner and by the growing maturity of players like Syd Owen, Charlie Watkins and Bob Morton. Luton Town challenged for promotion before finishing eighth and again reached the sixth round of the FA Cup.", "Luton's cup exploits of 1958\u201359 disguised the beginnings of an era of decline. Dally Duncan's team was beginning to show its age \u2013 Syd Owen was already 37 and taking on coaching responsibilities. Duncan left for Blackburn Rovers in October 1958, and for the rest of the season team affairs were managed by a committee made up of club directors and coaching staff. The club struggled to a 17th-place finish, but in the FA Cup Luton enjoyed unprecedented success. Luton accomplished the rare feat of fielding the same team of eleven players all the way through to the FA Cup Final. Gordon Turner had lost his place through injury problems earlier on in the season, and when the choice was made by the directors to name an unchanged team for the final, thus leaving Turner out, there was much controversy. Luton had beaten Forest 5\u20131 just weeks before, but on cup final day, the Luton team was beaten 2\u20131."]}, {"page": "Luton Town F.C.\u2013Watford F.C. rivalry", "response": ["The competition saw 23 goals scored, 14 for Luton and 9 for Watford; the individual player who scored the most goals was Luton Town's Gordon Turner, who appeared in all seven matches and scored five goals.", "|Gordon Turner"]}, {"page": "List of Luton Town F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["The record for most games played for the club is held by Bob Morton, who made 562 appearances between 1946 and 1964.
