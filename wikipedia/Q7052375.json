He also played minor counties cricket for Devon between 1938 and 1955.\nHumphries made his debut near the end of June 1946, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, and scored 21 in his only innings.\nAfter making 3 in the first innings of his next game, against Glamorgan, he showed quite some consistency, his next five innings being 22, 16, 17, 22 and 16.\nHowever, he was unable to break through and produce a significant score, and after this one season he was never again to appear at first-class level.\nFor Devon, however, it could be a different story, and in June 1949 Humphries produced his finest form. First he hit 199 against Kent II,\nand immediately thereafter he struck 216 not out, carrying his bat against Surrey II. By coincidence, in this game Alan Brazier made 216 not out in Surrey II's own first innings!Two brothers, Cedric and Gerald, also played for Worcestershire.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in December 2000", "response": ["*Norman Humphries, 83, English cricketer.Norman Humphries"]}]}}
