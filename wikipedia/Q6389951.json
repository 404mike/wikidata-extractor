There were minor improvements in the 1960s, including closing the road for a month in 1967 for levelling and resurfacing. A proposal to fully dual the A303 past Stonehenge was announced in the mid-1970s, but was criticised as being \"an environmental disaster\" and comparable to driving a dual carriageway through Westminster Abbey. A more comprehensive solution was discussed in 1989's Roads for Prosperity programme, which included upgrading the road to dual carriageway and bypassing Winterborne Stoke. In 1993, the Minister for Roads, Kenneth Carlisle, announced plans for either a  tunnel or a diversion of the A303 a mile from Stonehenge, costing \u00a344 million and \u00a322 million respectively. Although the new Labour government cancelled many road schemes after coming to power in 1997, there was still general support for a tunnel at Stonehenge."]}, {"page": "Twyford Down", "response": ["Protesters demonstrated their opposition to the road's construction by blocking the path of construction equipment. They were met by security officers from Group 4. In December 1992, in view of a film crew from The Observer, a protester was manhandled by five officers. Another protester, according to a report by local MP John Denham, was strangled by officers and left unconscious on top of the Down for 30 minutes. Maggie Lambert, then a mature photography student, took numerous photographs of the protest, and challenged an injunction which suggested she had been involved with direct action. While Lord Justice Mann admitted there was no evidence to suggest she had done anything more than take photographs, the injunction was upheld. Protester Rebecca Lush of the Donga Tribe, who had stayed on the down from September to the night of eviction, later claimed \"It was a horrific experience and very violent. We were dragged through thorns and we were being kicked and punched and someone pulled out a clump of my hair.\" In March 1993, Kenneth Carlisle, then Minister for Roads and Traffic, refused to order an inquiry into any wrongdoing or excessive force by security officers, stating it was a matter for the police."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Kenneth Carlisle"]}, {"page": "Lymm", "response": ["* Kenneth Carlisle (1882 in Lymm \u2013 1967), English cricketer active from 1903 to 1905 who played for Oxford University"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Kenneth Carlisle"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Kenneth Carlisle"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Kenneth Carlisle"]}, {"page": "List of ministers under Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["!scope=row|Kenneth Carlisle", "!scope=row|Kenneth Carlisle"]}, {"page": "Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Kenneth Carlisle"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Sir Kenneth Carlisle MP (1941\u2013), Lord Commissioner of the Treasury (1988\u20131990)Mosley, Burke 106, p. 3", "*Kenneth Carlisle (1882\u20131967), English first-class cricketerHarrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 774", "*Kenneth Carlisle (1908\u20131983), English first-class cricketerWisden Cricketer's Almanack, \"Obituaries in 1967\""]}, {"page": "Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway", "response": ["* Hon.
