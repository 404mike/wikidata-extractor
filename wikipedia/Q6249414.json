Upon leaving, he found work in Essex, as a labourer, then later became a farm manager in Yorkshire. This led on to farming in Sussex and then back in Essex, and Morgan travelled internationally to study agriculture. He gave the For Farmers Only series of lectures on BBC Radio in 1933, and under the pseudonym \"John Sussex\", he was the agricultural correspondent to the Daily Herald.Morgan stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate in East Grinstead at the 1924 United Kingdom general election, both Maidstone and Rugby in 1929, and Bosworth in 1931, then lost at Leicester West in 1935 by only 87 votes. He was elected as the Member of Parliament for Doncaster in the West Riding of Yorkshire at a by-election in November 1938, following the death of the Labour MP Alfred Short. However, he was in the House of Commons for barely two years when he died in December 1940, aged 48.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Morgan", "response": ["John Morgan may refer to:", "*John Morgan (poet) (1688\u2013c. 1733), Welsh clergyman, scholar and poet", "*John Morgan (artist) (1822\u20131885), British painter", "*John Morgan (comedian) (1930\u20132004), Welsh-born Canadian comedian", "*John Morgan (sportscaster) (born 1950), American broadcaster and television producer", "*John Morgan (The Wurzels), drummer for The Wurzels", "* John Morgan (admiral), United States Navy Vice Admiral", "*John Morgan (by 1524 \u2013 will proved 1559) (died 1550s), MP for Monmouth Boroughs", "*John Morgan (fl. 1563), MP for Carmarthen Boroughs", "*John Morgan (died by 1572), MP for Leominster", "*John Morgan (merchant) (died 1715), Member of Parliament for Monmouth, 1701\u20131705", "*Sir John Morgan, 2nd Baronet (c. 1650\u20131693), Member of Parliament for Radnor, 1681, and Herefordshire, 1685\u20131693", "*John Morgan (of Rhiwpera) (1671\u20131720), Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire, 1701\u20131720", "*Sir John Morgan, 4th Baronet (1710\u20131767), Member of Parliament for Hereford, 1734\u20131741, and Herefordshire, 1765\u20131767", "*John Morgan (of Dderw) (1742\u20131792), Member of Parliament for Brecon, 1769\u20131771, and Monmouthshire, 1771\u20131792", "*John Morgan (British politician) (1892\u20131940), Labour MP for Doncaster, 1938\u20131941", "*John Morgan (Wisconsin politician) (1846\u20131926), member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "* John Morgan (Archdeacon of Bangor) (1840\u20131924)", "*John Morgan (bishop) (1886\u20131957), Archbishop of Wales, 1949\u20131957", "*John Morgan (missionary) (1806\u20131865), New Zealand missionary", "*John Morgan (priest), Dean of Waterford, 1877\u20131903", "*John Morgan (footballer, born 1855) (1855\u20131937), Cambridge University A.F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*John Morgan (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u2013?), Wrexham A.F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*John Morgan (golfer) (1943\u20132006), English golfer on the European Tour in the 1970s and '80s", "*John Morgan (Australian footballer) (born 1953), Australian footballer for Melbourne", "*John Morgan (wrestler) (born 1963), American Olympic wrestler", "*John Morgan (cricketer) (born 1977), former English cricketer", "*John Morgan (mixed martial arts journalist) (born 1978)", "*John Morgan (rugby league), Australian former rugby league footballer", "*John Morgan (swimmer), Paralympic gold medal-winning swimmer", "* John Morgan (economist) (born 1967), American economist", "* John Morgan (etiquette expert) (1959\u20132000), British expert on etiquette", "* John Morgan (mathematician) (born 1946), mathematician at Stony Brook University", "* John Morgan (physician) (1735\u20131789), founder of first medical school in colonial America at University of Pennsylvania", "* John Morgan (British journalist) (1929\u20131988), Welsh journalist and broadcaster", "* John Morgan (lawyer) (born 1956), lawyer, founder of the Morgan & Morgan law firm", "* John Morgan (of Tredegar), Welsh nobleman", "* SS John Morgan, a 1943 World War II liberty ship", "* John Morgan (mixed martial arts journalist), mixed martial arts journalist"]}, {"page": "Doncaster (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Morgan"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|John Morgan", "|John Morgan"]}, {"page": "1938 Doncaster by-election", "response": ["The Doncaster by-election of 1938 was held on 17 November 1938.
