He made the one hour journey from his Bridgwater home to train with the club every Tuesday and Thursday. During this time, he played as a left-sided centre-back. Laird attracted interest from Rangers in 2003, with the SPL club enquiring about the player after his performances for Scotland in the Victory Shield. No move materialised, and he continued to progress through the youth system at Home Park. He signed an academy scholarship with the club aged 16, before being offered a two-year professional contract at the age of 17 by manager Tony Pulis in February 2006, which he signed. During his time as an apprentice, Laird lived in a hotel \"just for apprentices\" with Luke Summerfield, Reuben Reid, and Chris Zebroski, and described the experience as a \"great way to grow into football\"."]}, {"page": "Cherno Samba", "response": ["He returned to English football after Ian Holloway signed him for free on 31 August 2006 for Championship club Plymouth Argyle, on a two-year contract.
