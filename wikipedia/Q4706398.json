The referee for the match was Terry Holbrook.   Ian Ross, writing in The Times, described the playing surface as \"so dry as to make the bounce of the ball unpredictable\".  Although those conditions did not favour Leyton Orient whose \"attempts to play cohesive football floundered\", they had the first opportunity to score when a free kick from Kevin Dickenson struck the Wrexham crossbar from a Cooper header.  Alan Comfort played in a number of crosses but none were converted by his Leyton Orient colleagues.  Wrexham were limited to long-range chances, to no avail, and the match ended in a goalless draw.", "|LM || 11||Alan Comfort ", "|LM || 11||Alan Comfort "]}]}}
