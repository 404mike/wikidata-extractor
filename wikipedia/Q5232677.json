He came to national prominence as a vigorous and eloquent leader of the campaign to prevent the digging of a cutting through Twyford Down. In spite of legal challenges in the High Court and the European Court of Justice, the campaign ultimately failed to save the down, but it was a productive failure, which had a wide-ranging impact upon road planning nationally.Croker's campaigning style was vigorous and passionate, but never sentimental and emotive. It was based upon meticulous research and cogent argument, and he drew upon his professional expertise, honed at IBM, in the technological management of transport issues.\nIn later years, he remained highly motivated by his environmental convictions and continued to campaign for a sustainable transport policy. In 1995, the year after the Twyford cutting opened to traffic, he advised a group of campaigners who were taking European legal action to stop construction of the Newbury bypass, another controversial road scheme. The same year, he wrote: \"Today we would be able to stop what happened to Twyford Down. As it is, we are left with a ruined landscape, which we must continue to hold up as an example wherever else we fight a campaign. There must be no repeat. Let Twyford Down be the death throes of a discredited transport system.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Twyford Down", "response": ["In March 1992, two travellers pitched a camp on the down, and discovered from local ramblers about the Bar End to Compton contract, meaning the land they were sitting on would soon be excavated. In response, noting that public inquiries had failed to stop construction, they decided to gather support. Environmental organisations attempted to take Department for Transport to the High Court, stating that the road was against the government's own environmental protection laws. The European Commission dropped its objections that August. David Croker, who had become head of the protest group Twyford Down Association, said they \"had come to depend on the European Commission so we're very disappointed.\""]}, {"page": "Croker (disambiguation)", "response": ["*David Croker (1932\u20132006), British environmental activist"]}, {"page": "Croker, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Croker"]}]}}
