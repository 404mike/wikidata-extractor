Opening the bowling in both innings with Brian Close, who was medium pace, Trueman took two for 72 and one for 22 as Cambridge were dismissed for 283 and 196 respectively. Yorkshire scored 317 for six declared and 164 for one so Trueman, who was number 11 in the order, did not bat. Trueman's first wicket was that of opening batsman Robert Morris, who was caught by Ellis Robinson for 19. In the second innings, Trueman bowled the future Sussex and England batsman Hubert Doggart for 23. Three other debutants that day who all became England players were Close and opening batsman Frank Lowson for Yorkshire; and Middlesex fast bowler John Warr for Cambridge. Many years later, Warr wrote the biographical piece about Trueman in Barclays World of Cricket.Warr, Barclays, p. 239. Trueman had match figures of six for 72 in his second match against Oxford, which Yorkshire lost by 69 runs. A month later, he took eight for 70 against the Minor Counties on his first appearance at Lord's, bowling unchanged through the second innings.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950, p. 270.

David Frith continued with Trueman reaching the wicket, where he turned his body side-on and cocked back his ball-carrying right arm, as the leading left arm was hoisted, before \"an awesome cartwheel\" sent him into a follow through which \"resembled a Sea Fury finishing its mission along the runway of an aircraft carrier\".Frith, p. 169. Warr said Trueman's final stride had a \"pronounced drag\" which caused him some difficulties when the front-foot rule was introduced. His bowling arm was kept high through the delivery stride, to generate extra bounce and pace off the pitch, and the movement of the ball was \"predominantly away from the bat\" (i.e., the out-swinger). Trueman himself maintained that his ability to bowl outswingers consistently was \"another new ingredient I brought to the county game\". As Maurice Leyland said to him: \"Keep bowling those outswingers, Fred, and you'll be all right. That's the one that gets the great batsmen out!\" Trueman acknowledged that other great fast bowlers who could bowl the outswinger well were Ray Lindwall and Wes Hall; but Brian Statham and Frank Tyson could not.Ball of Fire, p. 57.", "*  Article on Fred Trueman written by John Warr."]}, {"page": "Freddie Brown (cricketer)", "response": ["In the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia were dismissed for 194 and England were reduced to 54/5 before Brown came in to top-score with 62 in England's 197.

This perceived dominance is not borne out by statistics; Morris' average was 57.42 in the 37 Test innings in which he faced Bedser, and more than sixty in the 46 first-class innings when the two met. In their last meeting at Test level in 1954\u201355, Morris scored 153. The pair were very close friends, and Bedser frequently made the point of rebutting criticism of Morris' performance against him. Bedser noted Morris' gracious demeanour despite his struggles, recalling an incident during the 1950\u201351 season when Morris reached his century during a tour match against the English. Instead of thinking of his difficulties against Bedser, Morris commented on the plight of his English opponents who had suffered harder times. Morris stated that \"Bob Berry hasn't got a wicket and John Warr hasn't taken a catch all tour so I'll see what can be done.\" Morris was then caught by Warr from Berry's bowling without adding to his score.McHarg, p. 180."]}, {"page": "Les Jackson (cricketer)", "response": ["After many delays, including the outbreak of World War II, Jackson became a professional with Worksop in 1947, playing in the Bassetlaw League and joined Derbyshire later in the 1947 season, making his first-class debut against Kent on 5 July 1947. He formed formidable bowling partnerships with Cliff Gladwin, and then with Harold Rhodes, both also England Test players.

In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less.p70, Swanton The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; the rest of the team had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle.p69, Swanton Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either.p146, Andrew Ward, Cricket's Strangest Matches, Robson Books, 2001 In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.pp22-26, pp214-228, Fingletonp402, Colin Frith, Pageant of Cricket, Macmillan Company of Australia, 1987pp9-12, O'Reilly", "Alec Bedser dominated the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) as much as Len Hutton did the batting and by the end of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world.p13, Kay He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both.pp22-23, Kay Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length.

John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler.pp21-22, Kay Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen.", "England failed to match the Australians' high standards of fielding and were nicknamed Brown's Cows by the Australian barrackers.p10, Freddi They dropped six catches in a match against Victoria and made frequent mistakes in the state matches. However, they made a considerable improvement in the Tests with \"...first class work in the field, in direct contrast to the slovenly and often lackadaisical displays in the previous games of the tour\".p128, Kay Even so, they never reached the heights of catching and fielding displayed by the Australian team. Both Brown and Alec Bedser weighted 15 stone (over 200 lb or 100 kilos) and were particularly ungainly in the field, but their bucket-like hands picked up 9 catches and Brown twice caught and bowled Keith Miller. Godfrey Evans was the outstanding wicket-keeper of his generation whose enthusiasm could energise a fielding team and always entertained the crowd with his antics. His deputy was Arthur McIntyre, who kept wicket for Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and Tony Lock in the Surrey side that would win the County Championship seven times in a row in 1952-58. Len Hutton was a good slip and would pick up 9 catches in the series and Trevor Bailey took some great catches in the gully. Unfortunately the MCC had no other slip fielders and they were joined by Gilbert Parkhouse, who hated the role and frequently dropped catches.p25, Kay John Dewes was a good outfielder, but the rest of the team failed to impress and a picture of John Warr was used to illustrate how not to take catches.p400, Frith"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1962\u201363", "response": ["Bernard Marmaduke Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, KG, GCVO, PC, Earl Marshal, Chief Butler of England was Her Majesty's Representative at Ascot, the secular leader of the Roman Catholic Church in the United Kingdom.

Hutton insisted on a look and bounced on the grass a few times so that it would lose its shape.

Miller said this was the finest catch of his career; \"He played the perfect cut, but, fielding in the gully, I had anticipated the shot.

Gilbert Parkhouse survived until tea, but Reg Simpson guided another ball from Miller to Sam Loxton at short-fine-leg and England were 137/4. The popular Freddie Brown strode out to the applause of the crowd hoping for some more Melbourne-style big-hitting and they were not disappointed. Hassett took the new ball, but Brown hit Bill Johnston to the fence, lofted Lindwall into the deep and cracked a straight-drive onto Umpire Barlow's foot. He added 50 with Parkhouse (25) before the Welshman pulled Ian Johnson to Arthur Morris at mid-on at 187/5.

The bowling thus fell heavily on the shoulders of Alec Bedser, the 40-year-old captain Freddie Brown and debutant John Warr. They had no regular spinner and would have to rely on Brown's part-time leg-spin, the left-arm unorthodox spin of the injured Denis Compton and the comedy leg-breaks of Len Hutton. In the end Compton only bowled 6 overs and Hutton none; the bowling was completed by Bedser (43\u20134\u2013107\u20134), Warr (36\u20134\u2013142\u20130) and Brown (44\u20134\u2013153\u20134), bowling eight-ball overs. The innings began with John Warr bowling to Ken Archer as Arthur Morris always batted second and his nemesis Alec Bedser bowled him with the first ball of the second over. Although Neil Harvey had made 74, 12, 42 and 31 batting at number 3 Lindsay Hassett finally saw that the left-handed strokemaker would fare better further down the order and came in himself. With rain expected over the weekend Brown set defensive fields and with the England fielding on top form Archer (44 not out) and Hassett (62 not out) slowly batted out the day for 110/1 despite the constant barracking of the crowd, who shouted \"Get on with it!\". There was rain on the rest day, but most of it avoided the ground and it rolled out well. When play resumed the wicket took a lot of pace and bounce from the ball and England were doomed to a long day in the field. Even so Godfrey Evans took a brilliant catch off a leg-glance by Archer (48) off Bedser, who was involved in the first 6 wickets to fall. Brown bowled a leg-spinner that fizzed off the pitch and beat Hassett (70) and missed the stumps, but his next ball the Australian captain hit a catch to Bedser at mid-on and his team was 122/3. The presence of Neil Harvey and Keith Miller at the crease against a depleted bowling attack would usually ensure a flow of runs, but while Harvey hit 39 in 79\u00a0minutes before being bowled by Bedser, Miller nudged his way at the funeral rate of 24 runs an hour. Sam Loxton survived a close run out when Cyril Washbrook brilliantly threw down his stumps, but was out for 17 when he hoisted a long hop from Brown into the hands of Bedser, who then caught Don Tallon lbw for 18. At 252/6 Australia were still 38 runs behind when Ian Johnson came to the crease and started to hit the ball around in his top Test score of 77, he added 150 with Miller in the highest seventh wicket stand for Australia since Clem Hill and Hugh Trumble made 165 at Melbourne in 1897\u201398. They took Australia past 300 and 400 for the first time in the series and Miller reached his century after 274\u00a0minutes. Brown bowled Johnson, had Lindwall lbw and had Australia 406/8. With the tail now in Miller lifted Warr for six, but ran out Bill Johnston and Jack Iverson to end the innings with his then highest Test score of 145 not out.

Since the Third Test they had won four games on the trot by 9 wickets, 10 wickets, an innings and 25 runs and 152 runs and morale was as high as it had ever been. After his dismal showing at Sydney the Australian vice-captain Arthur Morris asked to be dropped, he had been dismissed four times out of five by Alec Bedser (for 25, 0, 2 and 0) and was nicknamed \"Bedser's Bunny\". The selectors declined and instead dropped Sam Loxton after 11 consecutive Tests and brought in Jim Burke of New South Wales to strengthen the lower order batting. Loxton was an outstanding fielder and was still brought to Adelaide as 12th man. Roy Tattersall of Lancashire had been flown out as a replacement for the injured Doug Wright and was picked for his debut. This young off-spinner had topped the tables in 1950 with 193 wickets (13.59), including twenty 5-wicket hauls and six 10-wicket hauls. The England players had been singing his praises since they arrived in Australia, so there was much curiosity about him down under. Doug Wright's pulled leg-muscle has recovered and he would also play and Tattersall replaced Trevor Bailey, whose broken thumb had not yet mended. Gilbert Parkhouse was dropped and replaced by his fellow amateur David Sheppard and despite taking 0/142 at Sydney John Warr was kept in the team. The Adelaide Oval was notorious for being the flattest wicket in Australia, but had taken spin from the first morning in the tour match when the MCC (211 & 220) beat South Australia (126 & 153) by 152 runs. Even so when Lindsay Hassett won the toss he made the easy decision to bat first.pp172-174, Fingletonp174 & pp198-200, Kaypp100-103, O'Reilly", "The first Australian wicket fell before a run was on the board for the third time in the series, but it was Ken Archer who succumbed to Alec Bedser when he glanced the third ball of the day to Denis Compton at short fine-leg, though he hung about the wicket even after he was given out by Umpire Barlow. Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had a tough day as the Adelaide Oval was up to its usual standards. Arthur Morris batted a very careful and composed innings, the highest of his Test career as he laid his reputation as \"Bedser's Bunny\" to rest. He made 206 out of Australia's 371 before he was the last man out, spending 7 hours and 42\u00a0minutes at the crease and striking 23 boundaries in the process. He passed 2,000 runs in Tests and made his seventh Ashes century in four years, overtaking Victor Trumper and Bill Woodfull placing him behind only Sir Donald Bradman on the list of Australian century-makers against England. No other Australian batsman made 50, but he added 95 runs for the second wicket with Lindsay Hassett (43), 110 for the third wicket with Neil Harvey (44) and 76 for the fourth wicket with Keith Miller (44). Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by Roy Tattersall (3/95). The young Lancashire off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow E.W. Swanton's boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant Jim Burke with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went down on one knee to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled Don Tallon, getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders. Alec Bedser returned figures of 3/74, but Hassett protected Morris early in his innings and Miller hit his first over of the second day for 15. Doug Wright took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but John Warr (0/63) could still not take a wicket.pp174-178, Fingletonpp200-205, Kaypp103-107, O'Reilly", "England's innings \u2013 like Australia's \u2013 revolved around their opener, in this case Len Hutton, who became the second Englishman to carry his bat through an innings against Australia, the other being Bobby Abel's 132 not out at Sydney in 1891\u201392. Hutton made 156 not out in England's 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. Ray Lindwall (3/51) dismissed Cyril Washbrook for 2 when the pedestrian Jack Iverson took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved the ball to the leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit Ian Johnson for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by Don Tallon for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. Reg Simpson was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler Bill Johnston and England finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon that he ought to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked Denis Compton's bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other England batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. David Sheppard almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, Godfrey Evans tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. Freddie Brown was caught leg before by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and Umpire Cocks gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant Roy Tattersall was crowded by the Australian fielders and was caught by Neil Harvey off Iverson for a duck. John Warr was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. Doug Wright came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at Brisbane. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the Kent spinner leg before wicket for 14. England were out for 272, 99 runs behind Australia and Hutton was applauded off the field by the Australian team.pp174-183, Fingletonpp205-207, Kaypp107-114, O'Reilly", "Australia now had three and a half days to set England an unreachable target and bowl them out. Ken Archer ran a four off Alec Bedser in the first over and Arthur Morris struck two boundaries off Doug Wright when he replaced John Warr in the sixth over. Archer called Morris for a run off Bedser, but they both hesitated in the middle and Morris was run out for 16 by a left-handed throw from David Sheppard. Lindsay Hassett was almost bowled first ball, but survived and Australia were 34/1 at stumps. Archer (32) and Hassett (31) returned in the morning to take the score along to 95/3, but it was Neil Harvey (68), Keith Miller (99) and debutant Jim Burke (101 not out) who put the match beyond doubt. Harvey and Miller ran the bowling ragged and added 99 for the fourth wicket until Harvey was bowled by Brown (1/14) and Miller chopped a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Doug Wright (2/109) and Roy Tattersall (1/116) were heavily punished and Bedser (0/62) was wicketless. Australia ended the fourth day 384 runs ahead and that evening Freddie Brown and Brigadier Green were hospitalised after a car crash returning from dinner with Sir Willoughby Norrie, the Governor of South Australia. A car had pulled out suddenly from a side street and Brown swerved into a post for holding electric tram lines. Brown left the hospital early in the morning, but was unfit to play and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional captain to lead England since Jack Hobbs when Arthur Carr was injured in 1924\u201325.p185, O'Reilly He was unable to prevent Jim Burke from making a Test century on debut, the ninth Australian to do so (compared to 10 Englishmen at the time). John Warr took his first and only Test wicket when Ian Johnson cut the ball to Evans, who knocked it up on the first attempt then ran forward to catch it on the rebound. Umpire Cocks took so long to make a decision that Johnson walked (almost unheard in Australia) to give the long-suffering Warr his first Test wicket and a bowling average of 281.00, the highest by an England bowler. The 12th man Sam Loxton was sent out by Hassett to tell Burke that he could take all the time he wanted over his hundred and the dour stock clerk reached his target after 245\u00a0minutes at the crease. Hassett then declared at 403/8 to give England a day and a half to make 503 to win.pp183-187, Fingletonpp207-208, Kaypp114-118, O'Reilly", "No team has ever made 500 runs to win a Test, though Len Hutton and Doug Wright had played in the Timeless Test when England made 654/5 chasing 696 to win, but drew the match because they had to catch their boat home. Realistically England could only hope to draw and Len Hutton (45) and Cyril Washbrook (31) added 74 for the first wicket, the highest opening stand of the series. Bill Johnston (4/73) removed them both, Hutton taken by Sam Loxton at short-leg (substituting for Iverson, who twisted his ankle on the ball), who also caught Denis Compton for a duck. In between he had Washbrook lbw and England entered the last day on 114/3. Reg Simpson (61) and David Sheppard (41) batted out the morning in a stand of 91 that lasted 157\u00a0minutes. He was also out to Johnston, caught Burke and Miller (3/27) snapped up Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Sheppard for 7 runs to leave them 228/7. Ian Johnson (2/63) had Roy Tattersall caught by Arthur Morris then bowled John Warr without a run being added and as Freddie Brown was absent injured England were out one hour and forty minutes from stumps on the sixth and last day.pp187-188, Fingletonpp208-209, Kaypp118-121, O'Reilly", "Going into the final Test England dropped the luckless John Warr in favour of Trevor Bailey and Freddie Brown has recovered enough for him to retain his place as captain. The Australian selectors declined to use the game to test some new players and kept their team except to drop Ken Archer in favour of debutant Graeme Hole. Jim Burke was promoted to open the innings with Arthur Morris, even though he had failed as Morris' opening partner for New South Wales and had found success only as a middle order batsman. The players returned to Melbourne \u2013 scene of the Second Test \u2013 as in those days Sydney and Melbourne alternated having two Tests in the Ashes series. Ian Johnson played even though he had a foot infection, and was spared from bowling too much by Hassett. There had been thunderstorms in the week before the Test, and the outfield and bowler's run ups were soft. Lindsay Hassett won the toss as a matter of course and Australia batted first.p190, Fingletonp221, Kaypp125-130, O'Reilly"]}, {"page": "MCC tour of Australia in 1950\u201351", "response": ["After the game at Nortam the MCC proceeded to Perth for a two-day game against the Western Australian Colts at the WACA Ground. The team was drawn from non-Sheffield Shield players and most were too old to be counted as \"Colts\". In any case the cricket fans of Perth were uninterested and there was only a small crowd. Nevertheless, the game provided good practice for the MCC. The Colts captain Ian Dick won the toss and elected to bat, though in this case it would have probably made little difference to the result whether he batted first for second as they were dismissed for 103 by John Warr (4/33), Eric Hollies (3/30) and Bob Berry (2/24). David Sheppard (109) overtook this total with Reg Simpson (57) as they added 126 for the first wicket with Gilbert Parkhouse adding 79 before he retired hurt and Denis Compton stoking his way to 76. Brown declared on 369/4 and soon had the Colts reeling to Compton's slow left-arm wrist-spin (4/8) and Brown's own leg-spin (3/18). They were dismissed for 117 and the MCC won by a morale boosting innings and 149 runs.pp38-39, Fingletonpp237-238, Kay", "Lindsay Hassett's Victoria was a tougher proposition, and they would win the Sheffield Shield for the 18th time that season. They also had the much vaunted \"mystery spin\" of Jack Iverson. Hassett as captain of both Victoria and Australia decided to play him against the England batsmen to see how they responded even though this might reveal his \"secret weapon\". Freddie Brown injured a finger and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional cricketer to captain the MCC for an entire game (Jack Hobbs took over during a match in 1924\u201325 when Arthur Gilligan was injured). Compton won the toss and made 107 on a good wicket with help from Len Hutton (32), Cyril Washbrook (40) and David Sheppard (28). Iverson was duly brought on and took the tailend wickets of Arthur Macintyre, John Warr and Bob Berry in his 3/85. Hassett noted that the recognised batsmen played him with due reverence and a high amount of concentration, and that he caused them trouble even though he did not threaten to take their wickets. Compton declared on 306/9 and saw the MCC total overtaken by Victoria over the course of the next two days thanks to Ron Howard (139) in his last first-class match with help from Test players Ian Johnson, (36), Doug Ring (70) and Bill Johnston (30) after Trevor Bailey (5/54) cheaply removed Ron Meuleman, Hassett, Neil Harvey, Sam Loxton and Eric Kerr. Their innings was interrupted for a day (7 November) for the Melbourne Cup, proving that \"everything stops for the Melbourne Cup\", or at least tour matches do. Victoria were all out for 331 on the last day and the MCC were left to bat out a pedestrian match with 79/4. Hassett was presumably satisfied with Iverson as he decided to hide him in the second innings and he did not bowl. The MCC for their part continued to live up to their billing as the worst fielding side to tour Australia.pp50-53, Fingletonpp109-114, Kay", "With only one game before the First Test Brown's men had to improve their form dramatically if they wanted to stand a chance against the powerful Australian team. Instead they conceded another first innings deficit to a weak Sheffield Shield team. the wicket-keeper-captain Don Tallon won the toss and batted and the MCC bowlers did quite well in the circumstances, Alec Bedser (3/40) and John Warr (3/70) having Queensland 23/2, but whatever good work they did was undone by slack fielding, poor catching and some new batsman making runs. Ken Archer (63), who would make his Test debut in the series added 120 with Aubrey Carrigan (100) and Ernest Toovey (58 not out) added 81 for the ninth wicket with Lawrence Chapman (38). The second day was rained off as they batted into the third day for 305. The local swing bowler Len Johnson took 6/66 in an innings of 291 that relied almost entirely on Cyril Washbrook (82) and John Dewes (117), both fighting their way back into form and jeered by the crowd as they ground out their unsightly innings. With Denis Compton making a dull 28 in 100 minutes and nobody else making 15 by the time they had finished only three overs could be bowled before stumps, but Warr picked up a wicket for no runs. The press were unsympathetic and with rumours that Hutton (damaged finger), Denis Compton (swollen knee) and Alec Bedser (influenza) were all ill or injured some wondered if the Test was worth playing. There were also the usual stories of dissension in the ranks whenever a team performs badly, which Brown hotly denied, thus providing a new story. In truth Brown ran a happy ship and allowed the team more socialising than previous captains. He also saw no reason why he should force amateur undergraduates to mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger team-mates.pp58-60, Fingletonpp31-32 & pp122-127, Kay", "The Australia XI match against the MCC used to be seen as virtually another Test match and important for the Australian selectors to see up and coming cricketers in action before choosing a team. For some reason in 1950\u201351 it was scheduled between the First and Second Tests and after the team for the latter had already been announced. Even if someone made a century or took ten wickets they could not be picked for the Australian team until the Third Test early in 1951, though Ken Archer and Jim Burke had been named in the XII and were fighting to avoid being the twelfth man. The game was held in Sydney as their rivals Melbourne were hosting two of the Tests. The Australian vice captain Arthur Morris was in charge on his home ground with local hero Keith Miller and the Victorian Neil Harvey who hardly needed testing. The batsmen Graeme Hole, wicket-keeper Gil Langley and bowlers Alan Walker, Geoff Noblet and Chris Langdon were also included, as was Ritchie Benaud, but he was too ill to play and was replaced by the veteran leg-spinner Doug Ring. Morris won the toss again and batted on a flat Sydney wicket, he added 170 with Ken Archer (81) before he was out for exactly 100, Harvey (40), Miller (62), Burke (128) and Hole (41) piled up the runs and Morris declared during the second day's tea interval for 526/9. John Warr (2/89) opened the bowling, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown failed to take a wicket and Eric Hollies (3/108) and Bob Berry (2/108 off just 14 overs) could not contain the attack. The two spinners could not blame the fielding as they each dropped Morris of their own bowling, and Berry dropping him off Hollies. Alan Walker (5/60) and Doug Ring (3/106) reduced the MCC's reply to 47/3 by stumps and it was up to Denis Compton (115) and nightwatchman Godfrey Evans (31) to restore the innings with a partnership of 85, followed by another of 130 between Compton and Gilbert Parkhouse (58). Burke added to his credentials be taking a great catch in gully to dismiss a tired Compton, leaving Brown to punch 46 before the tail gave way five runs short of saving the follow on. Morris sent the MCC back in to bat and saw them fall to 22/2 before John Dewes (66 not out) and Parkhouse (46 not out) saved the day. Dewes retired hurt at 66/2, but returned after Compton was dismissed for 29 and they ended on 173/3. Although Jim Burke made the most runs he carried the drinks in the Second Test and Archer opened with Morris, but Burke was chosen for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and made a century on debut. Langley proved to be a competent keeper, but failed to oust Don Tallon despite the latter's lack of form. The results for Freddie Brown were more dire, Compton's knee had swollen again due to his exertions and he was unfit to play at Melbourne, Berry and Hollies had proved incapable of containing the Australian batsmen and Bedser and Brown has lost the form which had caught Australia out at Brisbane. The only good news was that John Dewes had shown his fighting abilities regardless of form and a fair crowd had come to watch, so increasing coffers of the MCC Manager John Nash.pp100-102, Fingletonpp142-148, Kay", "Even though they lost the Second Test the reputation of the MCC rose again as they fought Australia to a thrilling 28 run finish. They returned to Sydney and played their second game against the strong New South Wales team in preparation for the Third Test. For the third time in a row the New South Wales captain Arthur Morris won the toss and batted on the flat Sydney wicket. On the two previous occasions his team amassed 509/3 and 526/9, but this time they were bowled out for 333 despite a third century from Morris (105), who hit two sixes and 9 fours regardless of his poor form as Bedser's Bunny in the Tests. Keith Miller hit 3 sixes and 7 fours in his 98, but \"puzzled the crowd by frequent periods when he would not be tempted into hitting anything, while on other occasions he burst out into hitting spells\". Doug Wright (3/98) removed both these giants in his own inimitable way and John Warr (4/74) cleaned up the tail with only Jim de Courcy making any headway with 72 not out. In response Ray Lindwall (1/76) and Alan Walker (1/98) removed Cyril Washbrook and David Sheppard and the MCC were 17/2, but this brought together Len Hutton and Reg Simpson. Hutton, usually so defensive, began to cream the spinners through the covers, making 150 of the first 253 runs in little over three hours when he tired of the sport, walked down the pitch to the pavilion and was stumped off Fred Johnston (2/166) without looking back. Simpson continued the bat for over nine hours compiling his highest ever first-class score of 259, adding 236 runs with Hutton and 228 with Gilbert Parkhouse (92). Leg-spinner Reg Madden (3/93) removed Parkhouse, Brown (0) and Evans (2) and when Simpson fell to the part-time off-spin of Jim Burke (1/32) the innings was declared at 553/5, 220 runs ahead. There was little time to finish the match, but New South Wales collapsed 31/5 to Warr (2/25) and Brown (3/24). Burke (40) and Jack Moroney (51 not out) added 90 runs for the sixth wicket and saved the day, stumps being drawn at 130/6.

Freddie Brown took a holiday in Victoria, Len Hutton went on a cruise to Sydney and Doug Wright took a break as well. Alec Bedser's identical twin brother Eric was in Australia on business (they were inseparable and lived together for 90 years) and was asked to help the MCC rest some of its players after the injuries and fatigue of the Third Test. Alec and Eric tossed a coin in their youth to see who would remain a fast bowler so that they could both get into the Surrey Colts, Eric lost and became an opening batsman and off-spinner. As always the Tasmanians were delighted to meet the MCC team and their stay on the island was always regarded as the most pleasant part of the tour. Tom Davidson won the toss for Tasmania, but they batted haphazardly towards 197 as John Warr (4/47) and Alec Bedser (4/56) worked their way through the team. The hero of the day was Keith Dollery (3/30), \"a fast-medium bowler who bowls with his cap on and touches the ground for luck with his finger before he takes off\"p153, Fingleton who removed the MCC openers David Sheppard and John Dewes and was carried off the field by his team-mates as the tourists were struggled to 18/2 at stumps. He had nightwatchman Godfrey Evans out in the morning for 28/3, but Reg Simpson (28), captain Denis Compton (41), Cyril Washbrook (61) and Alec Bedser (35) righted the ship and the MCC made 234, a lead of 42 runs. Tasmania did better second time round and reached 209/4 with Compton disappearing for 2/72 off 11 overs before Alec Bedser (4/30) and Warr (3/39) finished off the tail and the last six wickets fell for 20 runs. This left the MCC 187 runs to win in 135 minutes. This was achieved thanks to Sheppard (67 not out), Simpson (43) and Compton (77 not out), who hit the last six balls to the boundary before an enthusiastic crowd.pp153-154Fingleton", "In the penultimate First Class match of the tour Freddie Brown was still recovering from his car crash during the Fourth Test, and John Warr, Alec Bedser and Doug Wright were given a rest and Denis Compton had only Trevor Bailey (1/74), nursing his freshly healed broken finger, the young Brian Statham (1/47) and the out of form Brian Close (3/103), Eric Hollies (3/107) and Bob Berry (2/92). Lindsay Hassett took full advantage by making 232 after winning the toss \u2013 his highest First Class century \u2013 but no one else did except Doug Ring who made 74 as they added 166 for the seventh wicket. Hassett batted well into the second day finishing his century, which pretty much condemned the match to a draw on such a good wicket.
