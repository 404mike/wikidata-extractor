He further stated that the term 'Continuation War' was created at the start of the conflict by the Finnish government to justify the invasion to the population as a continuation of the defensive Winter War. The government also wished to emphasise that it was not an official ally of Germany, but a 'co-belligerent' fighting against a common enemy and with purely Finnish aims. Vehvil\u00e4inen wrote that the authenticity of the government's claim changed when the Finnish Army crossed the old frontier of 1939 and began to annex Soviet territory. British author Jonathan Clements asserted that by December 1941, Finnish soldiers had started questioning whether they were fighting a war of national defence or foreign conquest."]}, {"page": "Hentai", "response": ["* McCarthy, Helen, and Jonathan Clements (1998).

The project had been pitched, developed, and approved for production under the name Royal Space Force; Okada remarked that, to Gainax, it was \"its one and only title\". All Nippon Airways, one of the film's sponsors, however desired that the title include the word \"wings,\" while Bandai favored that the title should use the form \"Something of Something,\" on the reasoning that the last big anime hit had been called Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind. Over the course of 1986, more than 20 other titles for the film had been suggested to Gainax by outside parties, including Space \u2022 Love \u2022 Story, Myth of Passion, Young Morning Star Shirotsugh, Spirits of Fire, Song of Icarus, Parallel Zone 1987, and Zero Vertex.", "Following its initial English-language release in the mid-'90s, later retrospectives on anime have had a positive view of Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honn\u00eaamise. In a 1999 issue of Time, former Film Comment editor-in-chief Richard Corliss wrote an outline on the history of anime, listing under the year 1987 the remark, \"The Wings of Honn\u00eaamise is released, making anime officially an art form.\" In the 2006 edition of The Anime Encyclopedia, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy characterized the film as \"one of the shining examples of how cerebral and intelligent anime can be\". Simon Richmond, in 2009's The Rough Guide to Anime, wrote that the film's \"reputation has grown over time to the point where it is justly heralded as a classic of the medium\". whereas in 2014's Anime, Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc described the film as \"an example of science-fantasy anime as art-film narrative, combined with a coming-of-age drama that is intelligent and thought-provoking\". In a 2017  Paste listing of the 100 best anime movies of all time, Adult Swim senior vice president and on-air creative director Jason DeMarco ranked the film at #11, remarking, \"If The Wings of Honn\u00eaamise is a 'noble failure,' it's the sort of failure many filmmakers would kill to have on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\" During a 2021 interview with the New York Times, science fiction author Ted Chiang, whose Nebula Award-winning \"Story of Your Life\" was the basis for the Denis Villeneuve movie Arrival, cited Royal Space Force as the single most impressive example of world building in book or film: \"I just really was impressed by the way that the animators for that film, they invented an entirely new physical culture for this movie.

In addition to being a landmark in the sports genre and an inspiration of another sports anime, it has set many of the conventions of yuri.

Eric Luce, Ivevei Upatkoon, and Michael Poirier of EX.org all gave similarly positive reviews for the Japanese manga, Japanese anime, and English anime versions of Outlaw Star respectively. Luce was complimentary of the manga's \"raw\" yet \"good and distinctive\" artwork, detailed backgrounds, and good placement of characters among one another. However, he was annoyed that all the women have a \"disturbing tendency to all have the same silicone stiffened chests\" and that characters typically wear mad grins. Upatkoon found the artwork of the anime version to be good, and he particularly enjoyed the opening sequence, but took issue with the occasionally inconsistent character designs. He also appreciated the show's dichotomy between serious and humorous subject matter, shown by the titular ship in its grappler mode and how it communicates with the crew. Poirier found the main protagonist Gene to be the anime's best characterization: \"Gene Starwind is a sly, sharp-shooting hero whose success with his gun (and with the ladies) is matched only by his propensity to get space-sick. Imagine that: the star of a space-faring series has to continually worry about vomiting onto his control panel. This sort of ironic comedy can be found throughout Outlaw Star, creating excellent segues between the fantastic action sequences and the delightful characters.\" Poirier was intrigued by its other characters as well, and was impressed by the \"sharp but fluid\" animation style and the spaceship designs. Mania.com's David Owens appreciated the artistic style specifically for the characters, nearly all of which he incidentally found likeable. Jacob Churosh of THEM Anime Reviews additionally noted high animation quality throughout. Although he proclaimed the vehicle designs of Outlaw Star to be superb, Protoculture Addicts writer Martin Ouellette judged the animation and character designs to be \"less lucky\" and lacking in \"the special aura\" of Sunrise's acclaimed 1998 series Cowboy Bebop. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, authors of The Anime Encyclopedia agreeably denoted Outlaw Star as \"no competition for Cowboy Bebop in terms of style, content, or execution\"."]}]}}
