He conceded after 83 minutes from Chris Basham but Marvin Emnes scored an equaliser in added time. Leutwiler's third and final league appearance of the season came on 23 November, in Aitor Karanka's first match in charge, away to Leeds United: in the last minute of the first half, Steele was sent off for a foul on Dexter Blackstock and Leutwiler was brought on at the expense of Emnes in a 1\u20132 defeat."]}]}}
