He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his epic poem Paradise Lost (1667). Written in blank verse, Paradise Lost is widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written.", "John Milton was born in Bread Street, London, on 9 December 1608, the son of composer John Milton and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562\u20131647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton for embracing Protestantism. In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572\u20131637) and found lasting financial success as a scrivener. He lived in and worked from a house on Bread Street, where the Mermaid Tavern was located in Cheapside. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a musical composer, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as Henry Lawes.Lewalski 2003 p. 3.", "Milton's father's prosperity provided his eldest son with a private tutor, Thomas Young, a Scottish Presbyterian with an M.A. from the University of St. Andrews. Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. \"John Milton.\" British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500\u20131660: Second Series. Ed. Edward A. Malone. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 281. Literature Resource Center. After Young's tutorship, Milton attended St Paul's School in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Latin and Italian).", "In the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish a series of pamphlets over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce beyond grounds of adultery. (Anna Beer, one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with Hezekiah Woodward, who had more trouble.Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600. It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England, his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship. In Areopagitica, Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty. Milton also courted another woman during this time; we know nothing of her except that her name was Davis and she turned him down. However, it was enough to induce Mary Powell into returning to him which she did unexpectedly by begging him to take her back. She bore him two daughters in quick succession following their reconciliation.Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', The Oxford Handbook of Milton, ed. Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009Blair Hoxby, 'Areopagitica and Liberty', The Oxford Handbook of Milton, ed.

The years 1641\u201342 were dedicated to church politics and the struggle against episcopacy. After his divorce writings, Areopagitica, and a gap, he wrote in 1649\u201354 in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I, and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659\u201360 he foresaw the Restoration, and wrote to head it off.Blair Worden, Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham (2007), p. 154.", "As Richard Cromwell fell from power, he envisaged a step towards a freer republic or \"free commonwealth\", writing in the hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an awkward position, in the Ready and Easy Way, because he wanted to invoke the Good Old Cause and gain the support of the republicans, but without offering a democratic solution of any kind.Blair Worden, Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham (2007), Ch. 14, Milton and the Good Old Cause. His proposal, backed by reference (amongst other reasons) to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions, was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time, which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year.Austin Woolrych, Last Quest for Settlement 1657\u20131660, p. 202, in G. E. Aylmer (editor), The Interregnum: The Quest for Settlement 1646\u20131660 (1972), p. 17. Milton, an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides, was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned.", "Milton was neither a clergyman nor a theologian; however, theology, and particularly English Calvinism, formed the palette on which John Milton created his greatest thoughts.  John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton had been Roman Catholic). However, Milton's Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many Renaissance artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In Comus, Milton may make ironic use of the Caroline court masque by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.", "Milton embraced many heterodox Christian theological views. He has been accused of rejecting the Trinity, believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism, based on a non-trinitarian creed.Lewalski, Life of Milton, p. 253.William Bridges Hunter, A Milton Encyclopedia (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13. Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\"John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction In Areopagitica, Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside Arminians and Anabaptists.W.F. Draper, \"The Religious Life and Opinions of John Milton.\" In \"The Bibliotheca Sacra and Biblical Repository,\" Volume 17 (1860) p. 38. A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category.  In 2019, John Rogers stated, \"Heretics both, John Milton and Isaac Newton were, as most scholars now agree, Arians.\"John Rogers, \"Newton's Arian Epistemology and the Cosmogony of Paradise Lost.\" ELH: English Literary History 86.1 (2019): 77-106 online. ", "Through the Interregnum, Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an elect nation akin to the Old Testament Israel, and shows its leader, Oliver Cromwell, as a latter-day Moses. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the Millennium, which some sects, such as the Fifth Monarchists predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the Four Empires.Walter S. H. Lim, John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism (2006), p. 141.", "Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote convincingly,\"Christian and Humanist, Protestant, patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome, he faced what appeared to him to be the birth-pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism.\u201dA fair theological summary may be: that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.", "Even here, though, his originality is qualified: Thomas Gataker had already identified \"mutual solace\" as a principal goal in marriage.Christopher Hill, Milton and the English Revolution (1977), p. 127. Milton abandoned his campaign to legitimise divorce after 1645, but he expressed support for polygamy in the De Doctrina Christiana, the theological treatise that provides the clearest evidence for his views.John Milton, The Christian Doctrine in Complete Poems and Major Prose, ed.

Although the tracts were met with nothing but hostility and he later rued publishing them in English at all, they are important for analysing the relationship between Adam and Eve in his epic Paradise Lost. Spanning three years characterised by turbulent changes in the English printing business, they also provide an important context for the publication of Areopagitica, Milton's most famous work of prose.D.
