He made five appearances in The Football League for Chester.\nBiggins became one of Chester's youngest goalkeepers when he made his first team debut aged 17 in April 1958 against Rochdale, having already played regular reserve team football. The following month he played in both games in the final of the Welsh Cup and performed well even though Chester lost a replay to rivals Wrexham.Despite playing just a handful of league matches for Chester, he has the distinction of appearing in the club's final match in Football League Division Three North and first in the newly created Football League Division Four when the league system was restructured in 1958. He remained with the club until leaving for non\u2013league side Pwllheli in 1961.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in September 2006", "response": ["*Brian Biggins, 66, English football player (Chester City)."]}, {"page": "Biggins", "response": ["*Brian Biggins (1940\u20132006), English professional football player"]}, {"page": "Derek Owen", "response": ["Signed by Chester from Liverpool in 1958, he made his professional debut in a 2\u20132 draw at Walsall on 11 September 1958.
