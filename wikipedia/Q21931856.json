With the top two qualifying from each section hopes were high that progress could be made and these hopes were enhanced when Hearts were defeated 1\u20130 at Boghead. Despite losing to Berwick Rangers midweek at Sheilfield by the same score, a 4\u20131 home win over Airdrie on 19 August put things back on track.
