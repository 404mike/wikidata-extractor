Asquith on 20 June 1914 following Pankhurst's hunger strike.

In 1914 Sylvia Pankhurst went on hunger strike and refused to stop until the Prime minister received women so that they could present their case for the vote. Asquith agreed and Parsons was able to tell him of her problems as she was one of the six women chosen including Jessie Payne, led by Mrs Julia Scurr. She told Asquith that she gave birth to children but she had little say in deciding \"what is good for them.\" During world war one the East London Federation of Suffragettes opened a baby clinic and Parsons was the manager. She was remembered as assertive and persuasive,"]}]}}
