Taylor was a noted amateur batsman, who retired early as he needed to devote his time to his engineering business after the 1902 season.\nIt is likely that Taylor would have received England honours had he been able to keep up the game, for he was chosen as 12th man in the rain-ruined Lord's Test match in 1902. Taylor was a fleet-footed and extremely sound middle order batsman, who was especially strong against slow bowling on the many difficult pitches experienced in Yorkshire. Against fast bowling he was not as certain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1900 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 R. E.
