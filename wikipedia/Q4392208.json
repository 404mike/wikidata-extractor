It was translated into a number of languages, including English, German and Chinese. The English translation appeared in 1958 as Theoretical Astrophysics. Roderick Oliver Redman noted in 1960 that it has found \"many appreciative readers in both German and English speaking countries.\" It became a bible for a generation of astronomers and astrophysicists. The book received critical acclaim by contemporary astronomers. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin wrote that it is the \"only advanced book of this scope in English, it will be of the greatest value.\" George B.
