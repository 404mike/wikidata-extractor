In 1864 he was advertising enlargements using solar cameras and artificial light.\nIn 1879 Harman abandoned his photographic studio and moved to Ilford village where he began manufacturing dry gelatine plates in the basement of his new home in Cranbrook Road on the corner with Park Avenue.  As business grew, he expanded his workplace into the ground floor and employed two men and three boys. His early processes were rudimentary\u2014he applied his emulsion formula with a teapot\u2014but the huge growth in the photography market gave him the revenue he needed to build purpose-built premises in 1883. These 'Britannia Works' went public in 1891, were relaunched as The Britannia Works (1898) Limited in 1898. In 1900 they were renamed Ilford Limited, despite objections from the Ilford Urban District Council, who argued that being the area's largest employer did not give the company the right to assume the town's name.\nHarman retired from the company in 1897 due to ill health, but returned around the time of the renaming. By then he held a substantial share in the company. He favoured a proposal by George Eastman that Kodak and Ilford should merge in 1902. However, the directors of the much smaller Ilford perceived it as a takeover attempt, and Harman was persuaded to reject the proposal.\nHarman married a Dublin-born widow, Nina Knobble, who had a son George from her first marriage.\nIn 1894 Harman moved to Grayswood, Surrey. In 1900 he offered to finance a church in Grayswood, on land given by Lord Derby, on the condition that a parish be created there. In 1901, the new parish of Grayswood was formed from parts of the old parishes of Witley, Chiddingfold, Haslemere and Thursley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Haslemere", "response": ["The ecclesiastical parish of Grayswood was formed in 1901 from parts of the parishes of Witley, Chiddingfold, Haslemere and Thursley.

All Saints' Church was designed by the Swedish architect, Axel Haig, in a 13th-century style, influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement. The building was was completed in 1902 and is constructed of Bargate stone rubble with freestone dressings. The tower has a timber-framed belfry and is topped by a shingled spire. The interior includes an embroidery of the Annunciation, thought to be original, and paintings of Moses and David on linen, possibly by Carl Almquist. In the churchyard is a granite memorial stone to Axel Haig, carved in the shape of a Viking sail, which bears a relief of a longship."]}, {"page": "Ilford Photo", "response": ["The company was founded in 1879 by Alfred Hugh Harman as the Britannia Works Company.R J Hercock and G A Jones (1979), Silver by the Ton.
