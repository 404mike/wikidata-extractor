Born in England and educated in France and the US, he trained as an architect but turned to writing.  Bolton preferred working in collaboration with others, principally the English writers P. G. Wodehouse and Fred Thompson, with whom he wrote 21 and 14 shows respectively, and the American playwright George Middleton, with whom he wrote ten shows.  Among his other collaborators in Britain were George Grossmith Jr., Ian Hay and Weston and Lee.  In the US, he worked with George and Ira Gershwin, Kalmar and Ruby and Oscar Hammerstein II.\nBolton is best known for his early work on the Princess Theatre musicals during the First World War with Wodehouse and the composer Jerome Kern. These shows moved the American musical away from the traditions of European operetta to small scale, intimate productions with what the Oxford Encyclopedia of Popular Music calls \"smart and witty integrated books and lyrics, considered to be a watershed in the evolution of the American musical.\" Among his 50 plays and musicals, most of which were considered \"frothy confections\", additional hits included Primrose (1924), the Gershwins' Lady, Be Good (1925) and especially Cole Porter's Anything Goes (1934).\nBolton also wrote stage adaptations of novels by Henry James and Somerset Maugham, and wrote three novels on his own and a fourth in collaboration with Bernard Newman.  He worked on screenplays for such films as Ambassador Bill (1931) and Easter Parade (1948), and published four novels, Flowers for the Living (with Bernard Newman, 1958), The Olympians (1961), The Enchantress (1964) and Gracious Living (1966). With Wodehouse, he wrote a joint memoir of their Broadway years, entitled Bring on the Girls!

Instead of commissioning book, music and lyrics and then casting the show, Freedley sought to create an ideal musical with stars and writers all engaged from the outset.Citron (2005), p. 108 The stars he wanted were Ethel Merman, William Gaxton and comedian Victor Moore. He planned a story about a shipwreck and a desert island, and for the book he turned to P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton. For the songs, he decided on Porter. By telling each of these that he had already signed the others, Freedley gathered his ideal team together. A drastic last-minute rewrite was necessitated by a major shipping accident that dominated the news and made Bolton and Wodehouse's book seem tasteless. Nevertheless, the show, Anything Goes, was an immediate hit. Porter wrote what many consider his greatest score of this period. The New Yorker magazine's review said, \"Mr. Porter is in class by himself\",Citron (2005), p. 110 and Porter subsequently called it one of his two perfect shows, along with the later Kiss Me, Kate. Its songs include \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"All Through the Night\", \"You're the Top\" (one of his best-known list songs), and \"Blow, Gabriel, Blow\", as well as the title number.Kimball (1984), pp. 167\u201376 The show ran for 420 performances in New York (a particularly long run in the 1930s) and 261 in London.Citron (2005), p. 111 Porter, despite his lessons in orchestration from d'Indy, did not orchestrate his musicals.
