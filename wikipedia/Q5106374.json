Three days later, on 28 February, Stevenage faced fourth placed Huddersfield Town at Broadhall Way, drawing 2\u20132. The hosts were without first-team regulars Jon Ashton, Chris Beardsley, Luke Freeman, and John Mousinho, and goalkeeper Chris Day was forced off with a shoulder injury at half-time. Huddersfield took the lead shortly after the interval, Lee Novak slid in Danny Ward, who finished from an acute angle. The away side doubled their advantage just five minutes later, Novak scoring from 20-yards courtesy of a powerful strike. Stevenage reduced the deficit with twenty minutes left when Joel Byrom's corner found the head of Michael Bostwick, whose powerful header beat Alex Smithies in the Huddersfield goal. The hosts then had the opportunity to draw level after Wilson was fouled in the area by Sean Morrison, although Scott Laird saw his subsequent penalty saved by Smithies. With just two minutes remaining, Stevenage equalised. Substitute Jennison Myrie-Williams found space on the left wing, and fired the ball across goal, reaching fellow substitute Robin Shroot, who finished from a tight angle to ensure Stevenage earned a valuable point.", "Stevenage's nine game unbeaten run was ended on 6 April, losing 3\u20130 away to Tranmere Rovers courtesy of two early goals from on loan striker Jake Cassidy, and a second-half strike from Lucas Akins. Three days later, on 9 April, Stevenage welcomed Preston North End to Broadhall Way, signalling the return of former manager Graham Westley, who left Stevenage in January 2012 to take up the vacant position at Deepdale. The game ended 1\u20131, stretching Stevenage's winless run to seven league games. Preston took the lead with just four minutes remaining, with substitute Iain Hume sliding the ball in from six yards out following Danny Mayor's through ball. Stevenage then equalised in the fourth minute of injury time, with captain Mark Roberts heading in Michael Bostwick's floated cross to ensure a share of the spoils. The result meant that Stevenage were in ninth position, six points away from the final play-off place with just six games remaining. Stevenage travelled to in-form Yeovil Town five days after the draw with Preston, looking to secure a first away win in just under two months. Stevenage won the match 6\u20130, recording their biggest Football League victory to date, as well as recording the joint biggest away victory of 2011\u201312 League One campaign. Stevenage took an early lead in the match when Patrick Agyemang was played into the area by Craig Reid, Agyemang then squared the ball across goal for Luke Freeman to score from close range. Yeovil were reduced to ten men when Michael Woods fouled Michael Bostwick. Agyemang scored Stevenage's second goal when he collected Jamaal Lascelles long pass, before calmly beating Sam Walker in the Yeovil goal. Two goals within the space of three second half minutes put the game beyond doubt, with Jon Ashton and Lascelles scoring headers from set pieces. Mark Roberts added a fifth goal with ten minutes remaining \u2014 prodding in Freeman's centre. Freeman then scored his second, and Stevenage's sixth, when Jordan Slew made room down the right wing after a neat interchange with Agyemang, before finding Freeman at the back post to tap in from six yards out. The club then welcomed play-off rivals Carlisle United to Broadhall Way, knowing that a defeat would virtually end the club's play-off hopes. Stevenage dominated the first-half, but were unable to take an advantage into the interval. The second half was a much more even affair, with both teams spurning goalscoring opportunities. The deadlock was broken with just fifteen minutes remaining, substitute John Mousinho, returning from a six-month injury lay-off, latched onto Stacy Long's chipped through ball, before crashing the ball into the goal off the crossbar. Four days later, on 21 April, Stevenage hosted another team hoping to snatch the final play-off place when Brentford travelled to Broadhall Way. Stevenage secured a 2\u20131 victory, consequently ending Brentford's play-off hopes in the process. The visitors had the opportunity to take the lead on the half hour mark when Jamaal Lascelles was adjudged to have pushed Clinton Morrison in the area. However, Clayton Donaldson's penalty rebounded off the crossbar and Stevenage were able to clear to ensure the teams went in level at half-time. Brentford were then handed another chance from the penalty spot five minutes after the interval, this time the referee deemed Jon Ashton to have fouled Morrison. Brentford's Sam Saunders stepped up and his powerful penalty rebounded off the post and into the arms of Chris Day. Just three minutes after the second penalty miss, Stevenage were one goal to the good. Craig Reid controlled Lawrie Wilson's low cross, before hitting a shot on the turn that bounced off the ground and past Brentford goalkeeper Simon Moore. Luke Freeman then doubled Stevenage's advantage ten minutes later, dispossessing Adam Thompson before cutting in and hitting a right-footed shot that crashed into the goal off the post. Saunders reduced the deficit in injury-time with a curling free-kick, although Stevenage held on to secure a vital victory. The third straight victory, coupled with Notts County's home loss to Bury, meant that Stevenage were back in the play-off places with just two games remaining. Stevenage then travelled to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United in a game that was televised live on Sky Sports on 28 April, and attracted a crowd of over 30,000 spectators. The game was an evening kick-off, meaning Stevenage had moved down to seventh in the league table as a result of Notts County's 4\u20133 win at Wycombe Wanderers earlier in the day. The game ended 2\u20132, with Stevenage taking a two-goal lead through strikes from Joel Byrom and Scott Laird, before Sheffield United's Richard Cresswell and Matthew Lowton restored parity. The draw meant that Stevenage had regained their place in sixth with just one game remaining."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["The first week of April saw new Sheffield Wednesday manager Dave Jones win the Football League One Manager of the Month award, while Michail Antonio just missed out on Player of the Month award. 7 April saw another early kick-off with Sheffield Wednesday playing West Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town who were six points behind Sheffield Wednesday in fourth place and with a game in hand \u2013 meaning if they won Wednesday and their game in hand they would be above The Owls on goal difference. While Sheffield Wednesday of course were still trying to catch Sheffield United and every game was seen as a must win game. After a goalless first half Sheffield Wednesday seemed to be much of the better team, which was surprising considering the importance of the game for both teams, as well as both teams being next to each other in the table. It was a much closer contest in relation to goals, as the last meeting at Hillsborough Stadium finished an amazing 4\u20134. On the fifty-fourth minute Spaniard Miguel Llera struck a free-kick round the wall and into the bottom corner, scoring his first goal for Wednesday and giving them a well deserved lead. Then Nile Ranger found himself through on goal eighteen minutes later and having missed a 'sitter' and hitting the bar earlier, he showed composure to double The Owls' lead and the game finished 0\u20132. Sheffield Wednesday went home happy in knowledge of the importance of the game and the fact that they won comfortably compared to what was expected to be a very tough game. Sheffield United played later on in the day and again won as they edged out a 2\u20131 victory over Bournemouth. Two days later on the Bank Holiday Monday The Owls played their third consecutive early kick-off in a row as they played back at home and were live on Sky Sports against Oldham Athletic. Sheffield Wednesday had so far had similar results against the same clubs as their rivals Sheffield United, such as both losing at the likes of Carlisle United, Charlton Athletic, and Walsall, and both winning against teams such as Bournemouth, Bury etc. And with the knowledge of Sheffield United losing to Oldham Athletic earlier on in the season at home, Wednesday needed to ensure that this did not happen here. Gary Madine scored just before half-time and then Keith Treacy's two crosses with each foot secured victory for The Owls as Miguel Llera and Ryan Lowe headed home from them. Sheffield United again played later, this time a day after Sheffield Wednesday and they won bottom of the league Rochdale. With both rivals in such good form as they aim for automatic promotion it was likely to be who 'slipped' up first. And unfortunately for Sheffield Wednesday it was them as they drew with Colchester United, who had drawn their last four games at home. This game finished 1\u20131 after an early goal from Ian Henderson from a poor mistake by Michail Antonio and Miguel Llera equalised in the second half but The Owls were unable to pull off those three vital points and drew meaning with Sheffield United winning they were four points behind their rivals with three games to go \u2013 so although it had once before in the season looked like Sheffield United had secured the automatic promotion spot, it looked near enough confirmed this time as they had such a large goal difference as well. During the week though Sheffield United star striker and player Ched Evans was in court for the R v Evans and McDonald criminal prosecution case. Ched Evans on the Friday was found guilty of rape and was sentenced to five years in jail, meaning Sheffield United were without their best player of the season, who had led them to victory in so many games and scored over thirty goals throughout the season. However, with Sheffield United in such good form, there was still little doubts about the outcome of the season. The next day Sheffield Wednesday faced Carlisle United who were fighting for a play-off spot and was a must win game for them as well. While Sheffield United were away to in-form Milton Keynes Dons who lay in fifth place. Chris Lines's right-footed shot rolled into the bottom corner in the twenty-sixth minute of the match to put Sheffield Wednesday 1 goal up. Sheffield United however had conceded in their game to make things as they stood Wednesday one point behind their city rivals with two games to go. As Sheffield United were still trailing, Wednesday were cruelly punished for not finishing their chances within the game as James Berrett equalised to send Carlisle United into jubilation. As the Sheffield United game had finished Wednesday still had several minutes of stoppage time to play. And their deserved goal came as Michail Antonio who had injured his right foot and right shoulder during the game, continued to play and dribbled round one player and finished in a tight corner to send the Sheffield Wednesday fans absolutely crazy as Antonio's winning goal came in the ninety-fifth minute of the game. This goal still gave Wednesday a chance as they were now one point behind Sheffield United thanks to that late, late goal. With both Sheffield clubs playing teams who were likely to be relegated by the last game of the season, the second-to-last games of the season were seen to most as the decider in the automatic promotion race. It was Sheffield Wednesday who kicked off first at three o'clock on the Saturday of the last weekend of April. They faced another difficult challenge as Brentford who they were playing away, were desperate for maximum points as they looked to get into the final play-off place. In the first-half it was Brentford who were the better side as they missed one 'sitter' and hit the bar from four-yards out and should have been in front. However, a free-kick saw Keith Treacy pick out the bottom corner as the goalkeeper was not covering his near post and was caught unaware of that possibility. Wednesday went into the break ahead, although they had scored against the run of play. The second half was similar to the first but Wednesday were playing better, but Brentford still had the better of the play. And then in the sixty-second minute Mark Beevers conceded a penalty and was lucky not to be sent off after already having a yellow card. Clayton Donaldson scored and Sheffield Wednesday still being on the back foot, were looking unlikely to win even though they so desperately had to. Then up-jumped Miguel Llera to head the ball up into the net four minutes later to put Wednesday back in front. After several misses from Brentford, a one-on-one and a great save from Stephen Bywater, Sheffield Wednesday went home with a 2\u20131 win. Sheffield United had a late kick-off and was live on Sky Sports and was being viewed by all supporters of both rival clubs. They played Stevenage who were in an incredible run of form going into the game, as they pushed for the final play-off place themselves. Although, Sheffield United started brightly they were unable to convert any chances and was missing their star player Ched Evans. And then joy for Stevenage and Sheffield Wednesday fans alike as Joel Byrom scored and put Stevenage one nil up at half-time. Two minutes into the second half and Stevenage scored again, sending The Owls and Stevenage wild again. Sheffield United had to win to stay above Sheffield Wednesday and pulled a goal back and then Matthew Lowton equalised to make it 2\u20132 with five minutes to go plus stoppage time. It was the most tense and heart-racing moments of both Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday as they knew one goal for The Blades in those final moments could be the decisive goal in the automatic promotion race. A fabulous save from Chris Day in the final minutes was able to stop Sheffield United and they could only manage to draw. Meaning Sheffield Wednesday after such an amazing season, for fans of both clubs and the neutral, were now second and in the driving seat for automatic promotion."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["| Chris Day", "The club started September with a 1\u20131 draw against Shrewsbury Town at Broadhall Way. The away side took the lead after just five minutes; Chris Day spilled Marc Richards' free-kick, and Paul Parry was there to prod the ball into the goal on the rebound. Stevenage equalised twenty minutes later when Darius Charles ran from his own half before striking a curling shot from 25-yards that beat Chris Weale in the Shrewsbury goal. A 2\u20131 away victory against recently relegated Coventry City followed on 9 September, with the game being televised live on Sky Sports. Coventry took the lead after eleven minutes when loanee David McGoldrick turned on the edge of the area, before striking a curling effort into the top corner of the goal. Stevenage equalised ten minutes later when a counterattack culminated with a Luke Freeman shot being parried into the path of an onrushing Robin Shroot, who swept the ball home from just inside the area. The comeback was completed with twenty minutes remaining, substitute Marcus Haber heading in Darius Charles' flick on from a Freeman corner. Six days later, Stevenage faced newly promoted Crewe Alexandra at Broadhall Way. Crewe started brightly and opened the scoring after just six minutes. A Gregor Robertson free-kick was blocked, but found its way to Max Clayton on the left wing, who rifled the ball across goal where A-Jay Leitch-Smith was on hand to connect from close range. Leitch-Smith doubled Crewe's advantage almost instantly, running on to a neat Chuks Aneke pass before finishing calmly with a low driven shot. Luke Freeman halved Stevenage's deficit midway through the first-half when he unleashed a shot from 25-yards, following good work from Patrick Agyemang and Lucas Akins, which left Crewe goalkeeper Alan Martin rooted to the spot. Former Stevenage loanee, Aneke, was sent-off for Crewe in the second half for a two-footed tackle on Anthony Grant. The home side made their numerical advantage count when substitute Robin Shroot scored with a neat turn and finish with ten minutes remaining. A 3\u20131 home victory over Walsall followed on 18 September. Robin Shroot had given Stevenage a first-half lead with a tidy finish from outside the area, before Walsall's George Bowerman equalised on the hour mark. The home side restored their lead through Greg Tansey, who scored with a driven shot from 30-yards, his first goal for the club. Lucas Akins sealed the victory late-on, when he steered in Tansey's cross at the back post. A week later, on 22 September, Stevenage drew 1\u20131 at Doncaster Rovers. Loan signing Oliver Risser headed Stevenage into the lead, before Doncaster's Chris Brown levelled in the second-half. The month ended with a 2\u20132 against Bury at Broadhall Way. The visitors, under the new management of Kevin Blackwell, opened the scoring through Tom Hopper's looping header. After the interval, Stevenage scored twice within the space of two minutes to turn the game on its head. Marcus Haber headed in Luke Freeman's corner to restore parity, before Greg Tansey scored a curling long-range strike. Bury equalised through second-half substitute Mark Cullen, to ensure a share of the spoils.", "A day after the win over Wimbledon, on 15 August, the second round draw was made, with Stevenage being dealt another home tie, this time against Premier League opposition in the form of newly promoted Southampton. The match was played on 28 August, with Southampton running out 4\u20131 winners. The visitors took the lead early on in the second-half through Tadanari Lee, who swept home Billy Sharp's low cross. The away side doubled their advantage in controversial fashion when Sharp scored from a quick free-kick inside the area after referee Oliver Langford had wrongly adjudged defender Mark Roberts to have deliberately passed the ball back to goalkeeper Chris Day, who in-turn picked up the ball. Almost immediately after, Southampton scored once again, Jason Puncheon scoring with a volley from 35 yards. Substitute Michael Thalassitis scored his first goal for the club in injury-time to reduce the deficit, netting from an acute angle after good work down the right from David Gray. Southampton scored a fourth almost instantly when substitute Ben Reeves curled in a shot from the edge of the area."]}, {"page": "Steve Arnold (footballer, born 1989)", "response": ["Shortly after leaving Wycombe, Arnold signed for League One club Stevenage on a free transfer on 25 May 2012.
