He is remembered in the church of St Curig in Llangurig and the chapels called Capel Curig in Porthkerry, Langstone, Newport and Llanilid, all in Wales. The church of St. Julittas`s in Capel Curig is traditionally said to have been founded by him.\nCurig is thought to have migrated to Brittany at the end of his life and there are several churches there bearing his name. He is said to have died at Landerneau and been buried at Locquirec.He is commemorated on 16 June.", "link_mentions": {}}}
