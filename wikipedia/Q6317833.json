Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a study by the Cardiff University School of Journalism of the reporting of the war found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them, and only one in 10 questioned this assumption. It also found that, out of the main British broadcasters covering the war, the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source. It was also the least likely to use independent sources, like the Red Cross, who were more critical of the war. When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties, the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels. The report's author, Justin Lewis, wrote \"Far from revealing an anti-war BBC, our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage. Either way, it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti-war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis.\""]}, {"page": "Ian Hargreaves", "response": ["In 2015, he became a co-founder of Creative Cardiff, with Justin Lewis."]}, {"page": "Sut Jhally", "response": ["*Enlightened Racism (with Justin Lewis), (1992), .

From funding raised through the Rowntree Foundation, Davies commissioned a Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies research project led by Justin Lewis on the United Kingdom's national news coverage The researchers examined the origins of 2,000 stories that had been carried by The Times, The Daily Telegraph , The Guardian , and The Independent, and in some cases\u2212The Daily Mail.  The report found that only 12% of the stories were provably based on material that the reporters had fact-checked and investigated themselves. Based on the data, the research showed that \"everyday practices of news judgement, fact-checking, balance, criticising and interrogating sources et cetera, that are, in theory, central to routine, day-to-day journalism\" were the exception, not the rule. Davies thesis is that journalists themselves are not the reason for the increase in \"falsehood, distortion and propaganda\"\u2014the problem is structural. Corporations, that operate under a logic of commercialism, have taken over newsrooms. Citing Rupert Murdoch\u2014the founder and CEO of News Corp, as an example, Davies says that under the corporate model, there are fewer journalists working at newspapers and they have increased workloads. Journalists require time to make contacts, find new stories, and fact-check. Under time pressure they resort to recycling press releases and wire news, often without fact-checking."]}]}}
