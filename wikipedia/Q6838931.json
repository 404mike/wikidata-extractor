A right-handed batsman, Stewart's international career was hampered by illness that curtailed his first overseas tour \u2013 serving as vice-captain in India in 1963\u201364 \u2013 and he made only eight Test appearances in all, scoring two half-centuries. His domestic career for Surrey spanned eighteen years, in which he scored over 26,000 first-class runs with forty-nine centuries. He made a century on debut for his county, against Pakistan, and went on to break the then-world record number of catches in a match in 1957 with his strong fielding. He captained Surrey between 1963 and 1972, winning the County Championship in 1971. After retiring, he became a manager at the club and later for England until 1992. He then worked for the ECB until 1997.Stewart was awarded the OBE in 1998 for services to cricket. The cricket writer Colin Bateman commented, \"a staunch patriot and the toughest of opponents, he stamped his mark on Test cricket as England's first full-time manager far more emphatically than he did as a player\". His son, Alec Stewart, went on to play over 100 Tests for England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 16", "response": ["*1932 \u2013 Micky Stewart, English cricketer and coach"]}, {"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["The 1958 season was the last of Surrey's seven consecutive County Championships but it was marred by a quarrel between Laker and the team captain Peter May, who had accused Laker of \"not trying\" in a match against Kent at Blackheath in July. Kent won the match by 29 runs. Laker bowled a total of 54 overs in the match and that immediately followed a haul of 63 overs in a match against Glamorgan at Swansea, which Surrey won. It seems that Laker's spinning finger was definitely suffering from \"wear and tear\" at the time and this probably reduced his effectiveness. His colleagues held differing views about the matter. Peter Loader said May was completely out of order while Micky Stewart suggested that May should have been aware that \"Jim was knackered\". Godfrey Evans, who played for Kent in the match, said that Laker was \"ill-supported by May\". Raman Subba Row blamed May for his \"management style\" which was not at all people-oriented, unlike that of Stuart Surridge, May's predecessor as Surrey captain, who was a \"people person\" and \"down to earth\". On the other hand, Arthur McIntyre blamed Laker for his batting in the Kent match because he \"holed out\" and made a more general comment about Laker \"crying wolf\" over injuries to his fingers.", "In 1960, Laker's ghost-written autobiography Over To Me was published. It was controversial because it contained severe criticism of May, especially about the row which followed the match against Kent at Blackheath in 1958. Hill says that the book \"testified primarily to Laker's abiding dislike of the social chasm in cricket\" created by amateurism. Micky Stewart commented on Laker's view that the game should not be run by the \"traditional Oxbridge axis\" by saying Laker firmly believed that ability and not background were what counted in administration of the sport, but Stewart added that Laker had no problems with Oxbridge amateurs who were capable. Official displeasure with Over To Me led to the withdrawal by Surrey of Laker's free entry pass to facilities at The Oval. Soon afterwards, the MCC decided to support Surrey and cancelled Laker's honorary membership. Both were eventually restored. Surrey reinstated his free entry pass in 1964 and the MCC his honorary membership in 1967."]}, {"page": "Herne Hill", "response": ["*Micky Stewart, England and Surrey cricketer"]}, {"page": "Henry Blofeld", "response": ["Blofeld took a job at the merchant bank Robert Benson LonsdaleBlofeld (2001), p. 50 for three years, but it was not to his taste and he drifted into sports journalism.

On the day of the Test Stewart discharged himself from hospital and played despite his illness. After tea on the first day, Stewart was rushed back to hospital and played no further part in the tour.

In 1969, Surrey employed their very first overseas player: the very popular Pakistani leg break bowler Intikhab Alam. In addition to Intikhab, the Surrey attack in their Championship-winning side possessed four current or future England Test cricketers in Geoff Arnold, Robin Jackman, Bob Willis and Pat Pocock. Edrich was subsequently appointed captain in 1973 and led Surrey to second position in the County Championship in his first year in charge and then secured Surrey their first limited overs silverware the following year with victory in the Benson and Hedges Cup. Edrich's replacement as captain, Roger Knight, led Surrey to NatWest Trophy glory at Lord's in 1982.
