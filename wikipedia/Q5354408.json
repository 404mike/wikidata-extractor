These illustrations were strongly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, being highly detailed and haunting in content. Love and death were popular subject matter of Pre-Raphaelite art and something that can be seen in Eleanor Vere Boyle\u2019s work. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, even called her work \"great in design.\" However, even though she was one of the first woman artists to be recognized for her achievements, she did not exhibit or sell work often as it was not acceptable given her family\u2019s social status. Thus, she signed her works \u201cEVB\u201d to obscure her identity and quickly became one of the most important female illustrators in the 1860s.", "link_mentions": {}}}
