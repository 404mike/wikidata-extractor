Bruce reportedly found the plant growing \"wild\" in Assam while trading in the region. Maniram Dewan directed him to the local Singpho chief Bessa Gam. Bruce noticed local people (the Singhpos) brewing tea from the leaves of the bush and arranged with the local chiefs to provide him with samples of the leaves and seeds, which he planned to have scientifically examined. Robert Bruce died shortly thereafter, without having seen the plant properly classified. It was not until the early 1830s that Robert's brother, Charles, arranged for a few leaves from the Assam tea bush to be sent to the botanical gardens in Calcutta for proper examination. There, the plant was finally identified as a variety of tea, or Camellia sinensis var assamica, but different from the Chinese version (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis).", "While on a trade expedition through the Assam area with Singpho in 1823 Robert Bruce was introduced to a plant with which the Singpho and Khamti people made beverages and food. Through his brother, Charles Alexander Bruce who was in Sadiya, samples were sent to botanist Nathaniel Wallich who mistook it for camellia kissi. It was not until over a decade later that the Singpho's plant would be recognized as being the same plant as the Camellia sinensis growing in China, after Francis Jenkins and Andrew Charlton responded to the request of the British East India Company's Tea Committee for its agents to review prospects for establishing a source of tea outside of China. Charles Bruce guided a team, including Nathaniel Wallich, William Griffith and John McClelland, dispatched from the Tea Committee in 1836, to review the plant in its natural growing conditions around Sadiya. It was cultivated in the company's experimental garden with the first batch shipped to London in 1838 and auctioned in January 1839. Though it sold well the batch was noted as lacking fragrance compared to the tea from China which had been selectively cultivated for hundreds of years and having a dullness thought to be a consequence of inexperienced processing. That same year, two companies were incorporated to pursue the tea's development in Assam: the Assam Tea Association in London and the Bengal Tea Association in Kolkata, though they quickly amalgamated to form the Assam Company. Despite early proponents such as Maniram Dewan, British-led land reforms such as the Waste Lands Act to clear and privatize plots of land for agricultural purposes, the Assam Company struggled and was forced to reorganize in 1847. Similarly, despite having access to a large source of inexpensive labour, including tea-makers smuggled out of China, indentured Indians, and refugees from famine-striken areas, Assam at the time was a sparsely-populated, hot and humid undeveloped area and many died of disease. Despite the poor results, investment came from Britain to establish additional tea gardens, such as the Jorehaut Tea Company around Jorhat, in 1860s though by 1870 56 of the 60 companies operating tea gardens in Assam went bankrupt. Industrial mechanization in the 1870s finally resulted in profitable companies as more plucked leaves were able to be dried without rotting in the humid environment. Heated withering tables and steam-powered rolling machines precipitated a need for grading so the British adapted the existing systems of tea leaf grading to sort their products. The Indian Tea Districts Association was established in London in 1879 and in Kolkata in 1881 (as the Indian Tea Association) to organize and advance these tea interests. By 1888 tea imported from India finally exceed that from China."]}, {"page": "Robert Bruce (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Bruce or Robert the Bruce may also refer to:", "*Robert Bruce, Lord of Liddesdale (died 1332), illegitimate son of Robert the Bruce", "*Robert Bruce, 2nd Baron of Clackmannan (died 1403)", "*Robert Bruce, 3rd Baron of Clackmannan (died 1436)", "*Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1626\u20131685), English politician", "*Robert Bruce (Yukon politician) (born 1940), former Speaker of the Yukon Legislative Assembly", "*Robert Bruce (New Zealand politician) (1843\u20131917), Scottish born, New Zealand politician and conservationist", "*Robert Bruce (footballer) (1895\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*Robert Bruce (wrestler) (1943\u20132009), Scottish-born New Zealand professional wrestler and talent agent", "*Robert Bruce (swimmer) (born 1969), Australian former swimmer", "*Robert Bruce (Scottish composer) (1915\u20132012), composer and lecturer", "*Robert Bruce (opera), an 1846 pastiche opera with music taken from works by Gioachino Rossini", "*Robert Bruce (rapper) (born 1970), American rapper, Psychopathic Records don, and professional wrestler", "*Robert Bruce of Kinnaird (1554\u20131631), Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1588 and again in 1592", "*Robert Bruce (Pitt Chancellor) (1778\u20131846), professor and pastor, first Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, 1819\u20131935 and 1836\u20131843", "*Robert Bruce, Lord Kennet (1718\u20131785), Scottish advocate, legal scholar and judge", "*Robert Bruce (1668\u20131720), Russian general of Scottish background, brother of Jacob Bruce", "*Robert Bruce (merchant adventurer), Scottish adventurer and son of Chief Justice of Barbados Sir James Bruce", "*Robert Bruce (tea planter) (died 1824), pioneer in the field of tea plantations in Assam", "*Robert Bruce (active 1870\u20131900), missionary who revised Henry Martyn's Bible translations into Persian", "*Robert Bruce (British Army officer, born 1813) (1813\u20131862), British Army officer", "*Robert Bruce (British Army officer, born 1821) (1821\u20131891), British Army officer, colonel of the Queen's Royal Regiment"]}, {"page": "Macartney Embassy", "response": ["Among those who had called for a mission to China was Sir Joseph Banks, 1st Baronet, President of the Royal Society. Banks had been the botanist on board HMS Endeavour for the first voyage of Captain James Cook, as well as the driving force behind the 1787 expedition of HMS Bounty to Tahiti. Banks, who had been growing tea plants privately since 1780, had ambitions to gather valuable plants from all over the world to be studied at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the newly established Calcutta Botanical Garden in Bengal. Above all, he wanted to grow tea in Bengal or Assam, and address the \"immense debt of silver\" caused by the tea trade. At this time, botanists were not yet aware that a variety of the tea plant (camellia sinensis var. assamica) was already growing natively in Assam, a fact that Robert Bruce was to discover in 1823. Banks advised the embassy to gather as many plants as possible in their travels, especially tea plants. He also insisted that gardeners and artists be present on the expedition to make observations and illustrations of local flora. Accordingly, David Stronach and John Haxton served as the embassy's botanical gardeners.thumb|Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount MelvilleHenry Dundas laid out his goals for the mission in Macartney's official instructions. More British subjects had been trading in China than any other Europeans. Despite this, the British had no direct contact with the emperor, in contrast to the Portuguese, whose Jesuit missionaries retained permanent positions at the imperial court. Macartney was instructed to negotiate a relaxation of the Canton System, such that British traders could operate in more ports and markets, and to obtain a small island on the Chinese coast from which British merchants could operate under British jurisdiction. He was also to establish a permanent embassy in Beijing so as to create a direct line of communication between the two governments, cutting out the Cantonese merchants who had served as middlemen. Finally, he was to gather intelligence on the Chinese government and society, about which little was known in Europe at the time."]}]}}
