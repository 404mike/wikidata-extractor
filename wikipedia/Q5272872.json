Under new manager John McMillan the team struggled and finished the 1920\u201321 season bottom of the table, and in the years to follow there was little improvement, with the club regularly finishing in the lower reaches of the bottom division.  Gillingham did not manage to finish in the top half of the table until 1925\u201326, when the team finished in 10th place, due mainly to the goals of Dick Edmed, who was promptly signed by Liverpool for a fee of \u00a31,750, a new Gillingham record. Manager Harry Curtis departed soon afterwards to take over at Brentford, and former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Albert Hoskins stepped down a division to manage the club, but he could do little to change the team's fortunes and left in 1929 after Gillingham finished bottom of the table once again."]}, {"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*Dick Edmed (1904\u20131983) \u2013 footballer for Liverpool"]}, {"page": "List of Gillingham F.C. players (25\u201349 appearances)", "response": ["Each player's details include the duration of his Gillingham career, his typical playing position while with the club, and the number of games played and goals scored in all senior competitive matches.  Several players have contributed significantly to the history of the club, despite only playing between 24 and 49 games.  Deon Burton only spent one season at the club, but scored 13 goals, the second highest of any player that season, to help the club win the championship of Football League Two in the 2012\u201313 season.  Dave Martin captained the Gills to promotion from the Football League Third Division in the 1995\u201396 season.  Charlie McGibbon scored a hat-trick when New Brompton knocked Sunderland of the Football League First Division out of the FA Cup in the 1907\u201308 season, the club's first \"giant-killing\".  Darius Henderson, Charlie Satterthwaite and Dick Edmed went on to play at the highest level of football in England following their time at Gillingham."]}, {"page": "Edmed", "response": ["*Dick Edmed (1904\u20131984), English footballer"]}]}}
