This set up a second round tie against local rivals The Wednesday in a match that was preceded by torrential rain. Nevertheless, both teams attacked from the offset and The Wednesday took a two-goal lead in the opening ten minutes, the only goals United would concede en route to the final. United rallied and, after wasting several chances, goals from Tommy Sampy and George Green drew them level before half-time. Another goal by Sampy early in the second half gave United a 3\u20132 win."]}, {"page": "Tommy Boyle (footballer, born 1901)", "response": ["Born in Sheffield, Boyle was spotted playing for the Bullcroft Colliery team and signed for Sheffield United in 1921. He initially found it difficult to establish himself in the first team, but over time his form improved, particularly his heading, which was a factor in him being selected for the 1925 FA Cup Final ahead of the more experienced Tommy Sampy. He left the Blades in 1929 after making over 140 appearances and scoring 40 goals."]}, {"page": "Bill Sampy", "response": ["Born in Backworth, Northumberland, Bill Sampy was the younger brother of fellow Sheffield United player Tommy Sampy, although the two only played together on very rare occasions."]}, {"page": "List of English association football families", "response": ["* Tommy Sampy, Bill Sampy (brother)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Sampy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Sampy"]}]}}
