He left behind a widow, Elizabeth n\u00e9e Moore, but no children, with the majority of the family wealth being passed to his unmarried brother, William Henry Forman.In 1849, Forman purchased Pippbrook House in Dorking, Surrey. When he died (just over a year later), the property was inherited by his brother, William Henry Forman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bridgwater (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Thomas Seaton Forman ||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Thomas Forman", "response": ["*Thomas Seaton Forman (1791\u20131850), British Conservative politician"]}]}}
