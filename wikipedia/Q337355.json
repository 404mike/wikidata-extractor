Clark theorized in an article in The Baker Street Journal that Wolfe was the offspring of an affair between Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler (a character from \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"). Clark suggested that the two had an affair in Montenegro in 1892, and that Nero Wolfe was the result. The idea was later co-opted by William S. Baring-Gould and implied in the novels of Nicholas Meyer and John Lescroart, but there is no evidence that Rex Stout had any such connection in mind. Certainly there is no mention of it in any of the stories, although a painting of Sherlock Holmes does hang over Archie Goodwin's desk in Nero Wolfe's office. Some commentators note both physical and psychological resemblances and suggest Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes as a more likely father for Wolfe. Commentators have noted a coincidence in the names \"Sherlock Holmes\" and \"Nero Wolfe\": the same vowels appear in the same order. In 1957, Ellery Queen called this \"The Great O-E Theory\" and suggested that it was derived from the father of mysteries, Edgar Allan Poe.  The only mention of Wolfe's mother in Stout's stories is in the first novel, Fer-de-Lance (1935), in which it is stated that she lives in Budapest and Wolfe sends her a monthly check.", "William S.

Shaver responded with a story called \"I Remember Lemuria\", published in the March 1945 issue, which was presented by Palmer as a mixture of truth and fiction. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, dramatically boosted Amazing's circulation, and Palmer ran a new Shaver story in every issue, culminating in a special issue in June 1947 devoted entirely to the Shaver Mystery, as it was called.Ashley, Time Machines, pp.\u00a0178\u2013180. Amazing soon drew ridicule for these stories. A derisive article by William S. Baring-Gould in the September 1946 issue of Harper's prompted William Ziff to tell Palmer to limit the amount of Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer complied, but his interest (and possibly belief) in this sort of material was now significant, and he soon began planning to leave Ziff-Davis. In 1947 he formed Clark Publications, launching Fate the following year, and in 1949 he resigned from Ziff-Davis to edit that and other magazines.Ashley, Time Machines, pp.\u00a0183\u2013185."]}, {"page": "Irene Adler", "response": ["In his fictional biographies Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street (1962) and Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street (1969), William S.

It is worth \u00a37,000 to him, he explains, to make an example of Lady Eva; it is in his long-term interest to ensure that his future blackmail victims would be more \"open to reason\" and pay him what he wants, knowing he will destroy them if they do not.
