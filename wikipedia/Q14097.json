This method uses action research to help make radical improvements in work design. There is also a consensus approach which includes consultative participation. It allows work colleagues to become more motivated to expressing ideas. The method allows employees to get involved with the design process, meaning they have involvement in designing a job system and resolving conflicts. This method doesn\u2019t provide a straightforward approach for successful change, but does involve employees making an ethical and more supportive system design.Bednar, P. and Welch, C. (2016).

Global STS-D Network. .", "With the view that socio-technical design is by which intelligence and skill combined with emerging technologies could improve the work-life balance of employees, it is also believed that the aim is to achieve both a safer and more pleasurable workplace as well as to see greater democracy in society. The achievement of these aims would therefore lead to increased motivation of employees and would directly and positively influence their ability to express ideas. Enid Mumford's work on redesigning designing human systems also expressed that it is the role of the facilitator to \u201ckeep the members interested and motivated toward the design task, to help them resolve any conflicts\u201d.Mumford, E. 2003. Redesigning Human Systems.(pp 41) Cambridge: IRM Press, London University Press. .", "Enid Mumfords ETHICS development was a push from her to remind those in the field that research doesn't always need to be done on things of current interest and following the immediate trends over your current research is not always the way forward. A reminder that work should always be finished and we should never \u201cwrite them off with no outcome.\u201d as she said.", "* Enid Mumford (1985).

It studied how human cognitive psychology works hand-in-hand with specific cognitive limitations. This could only be done through time and trial and error. CE contrasts the tradition of physical ergonomics because \"cognitive ergonomics is...the application of psychology to work...to achieve the optimization between people and their work.\" Viewed as an applied science, the methods involved with creating cognitive ergonomic design have changed with the rapid development in technological advances over the last 27 years. In the 80's, there was a worldwide transition in the methodological approach to design. According to van der Veer, Enid Mumford was one of the pioneers of interactive systems engineering, and advocated the notion of user-centered design, wherein the user is considered and \"included in all phases of the design\". Cognitive ergonomics as defined by the International Ergonomics Association \"is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system\u201d. It studies the cognition in work to help with the human well being in system performances. "]}, {"page": "Association for Information Systems", "response": ["* 1999 : C. West Churchman, J.
