Through their shared love of David Bowie and 1980s new wave bands including Duran Duran and ABC they started socialising together at weekends, going to gigs in Liverpool and playing along to drum loops together in their bedrooms with the desire of forming a band together.Reid, Pat, Burning Ambition - Mansun's Stove, web.archive.org. Retrieved August 2011 Whilst King was a relative newcomer to playing bass, Draper had previously formed and fronted the electronic duo Grind whilst studying at Thames Polytechnic (now University of Greenwich), with programmer-keyboard player Steve Heaton, and were often accompanied live by school friend Carlton Hibbert on drums. Grind released one 12\" single in 1991 on the small \"Whats in It For Me Records\" label and gigged around London at venues such as The Rock Garden and The Brain and also supported Beverley Craven at the Mean Fiddler. Following the split of Grind, Draper, funded by a grant from The Prince's Trust, set up a music company called \"Ambiance Productions\" producing relaxation tapes to be sold in \"hippie shops\" across the north west of England. In early 1995 Draper and King enlisted Maidstone expat Dominic Chad, who was the bar manager at the Fat Cat pub on Watergate Street in Chester opposite the office where Draper would go and see former Grind member Steve Heaton. Chad had previously played with \"Floating Bear\" formed whilst at Bangor University in 1990, where he had been studying French and Russian but was kicked off the course due to lack of effort. Chad would later admit that his routine during university was \"get up at three, go down to the union bar at four and stay there until it shut\". With the aid of a drum machine, the trio began rehearsing at Crash Rehearsal Studios in Liverpool, where the band were quickly discovered by passing A&R scouts Mark Lewis and Alan Wills (who later went on to form Deltasonic Records) who were there to see Cast and overheard the band through their rehearsal room door. The band were offered a publishing contract with Polygram Music Publishing four days after reluctantly handing over a demo tape of 4 songs that cost \u00a3150 to record featuring \"Take It Easy Chicken\", \"Skin Up Pin Up\", \"Moronica\" and \"She Makes My Nose Bleed\".", "The band were initially called Grey Lantern, after Draper's DC Comics influenced alter ego which he created to help overcome his nervousness on stage, but soon changed their name to \"Manson\", after the cult leader Charles Manson. The band's self-financed debut release \"Take It Easy Chicken\" in September 1995 on their own \"Sci-Fi Hi-Fi Recordings\" label soon attracted the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and John Peel and the band found themselves, despite not having played a single gig and later admitting that they couldn't play together as a band very well at the time, at the centre of a record label bidding war. This resulted in the band signing to Parlophone, with whom they released the follow up single \"Skin Up Pin Up / Flourella\" in November 1995 on sublabel Regal Recordings, although this time under the new moniker \"Mansun\" as they were forced to change the spelling due to threatened legal action from the Charles Manson Estate. The band gave several false accounts of this at the time, one being that they were named after The Verve B-side \"A Man Called Sun\", and that \"Manson\" was simply a spelling mistake which accidentally went through to production. It was later reported that Charles Manson had started spelling his name with a \"u\", to which Draper joked that they should sue him in return.", "Following the release of \"Skin Up Pin Up / Flourella\", the band were moved up to the main Parlophone label and released several EPs, including an expanded re-release of the debut single. The first lineup of the band alongside Draper, King and Chad had featured former Grind drummer Carlton Hibbert and drum machine programmer Mark Swinnerton. Following five months of touring, starting with the band's first gig in August 1995 at The Lomax in Liverpool and support gigs with Heavy Stereo and The Charlatans, Swinnerton left the band in January 1996. As a four piece, the band continued touring including support gigs with Cast, Audioweb and Shed Seven until Hibbert was sacked from the band in May 1996 following a series of rows with an inebriated Chad that resulted in a bizarre incident that involved a pineapple being thrown at Chad's face in Cambridge, where the band were supporting Shed Seven. Throughout the early days of the band, Chad was involved in a string of violent alcohol fueled incidents. These included punching his own reflection in a hotel mirror, being thrown out of a pub after attempting to drop kick the bar, throwing pint glasses out of a window in Sheffield, getting himself banned along with the rest of the band from every outlet of the now defunct roadside restaurant chain Happy Eater, all Hard Rock Cafes worldwide and every Holiday Inn hotel in the UK after drop kicking a statue of the Venus de Milo. Ex-Kinky Machine drummer Julian Fenton was temporarily drafted in for gigs and featured in the promo videos for \"Take It Easy Chicken\" and \"Stripper Vicar\".", "Following the split, Draper worked with ex-Skunk Anansie singer Skin on songs for her Gordon Raphael produced album Fake Chemical State, and recorded demos for artists such as Komakino and Catherine A.D. In 2009 he worked with The Joy Formidable on their free download-only single \"Greyhounds in the Slips\". In 2007 Draper began working with singer-songwriter Catherine A.D, he has produced and co-written songs on her debut album which was due for release under the name The Anchoress in 2014."]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* John Blackburn (The Mescaleros, Skin)"]}, {"page": "Southside Festival", "response": ["*Skin", "*Skin", "*Skindred"]}, {"page": "Hurricane Festival", "response": ["| 22-20s, Anouk, Apocalyptica, Asian Dub Foundation, Beth Gibbons and Rustin Man, Bj\u00f6rk, Blackmail, Brendan Benson, Cellophane Suckers, Coldplay, Console, Counting Crows, Danko Jones, Fu Manchu, Goldfrapp, Good Charlotte, Grandaddy, Guano Apes, GusGus, International Pony, Interpol, Kettcar, Massive Attack, Millencolin, Moloko, Nada Surf, NOFX, Patrice, Pinkostar, Radiohead, R\u00f6yksopp, Seeed, Sigur R\u00f3s with Amina, Skin, Slut, Starsailor, Supergrass, The Datsuns, The Hellacopters, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Roots, The Sounds, Therapy?, Tocotronic, Turbonegro, Underwater Circus, Underworld, Union Youth, Venus Hum", "| Adam Green, Apocalyptica, Archive, Arctic Monkeys, Backyard Babies, Ben Harper & the Innocent Criminals, Billy Talent, Blackmail, Boozed, Collective Soul, Death Cab for Cutie, dEUS, Donavon Frankenreiter, Duels, Eagles of Death Metal, Elbow, Element of Crime, Everlaunch, Fettes Brot, Gnarls Barkley (Cancelled due to bad weather), Gods of Blitz, Gogol Bordello, Hard-Fi, Karamelo Santo, Klee, Lagwagon, Live, Mad Caddies, Mando Diao, Manu Chao Radio Bemba Sound System, Max\u00efmo Park, Nada Surf, Muse (Cancelled due to bad weather), Ohrbooten, The Weepies, The Pale, Pante\u00f3n Rococ\u00f3, Pete Blume, Photonensurfer, Pretty Girls Make Graves, Scissors For Lefty, Serena Maneesh, Seeed, She-Male Trouble, Shout Out Louds, Sigur R\u00f3s, Skin, Smoke Blow, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Cardigans, The Cooper Temple Clause, The Feeling, The Gossip, The Answer, The Hives, The Kooks, The Raconteurs, The Sounds, The Strokes, Tomte, Two Gallants, Voltaire, Wir sind Helden, Within Temptation (Cancelled due to bad weather), Zebrahead", "| Alberta Cross, Archive, Ash, Band Of Skulls, Beatsteaks, Biffy Clyro, Bigelf, Billy Talent, Bonaparte, Boys Noize(performance cancelled), Bratze, Charlie Winston, Coheed And Cambria, Cosmo Jarvis, Cymbals Eat Guitars, Danko Jones, Deftones, Deichkind, Dendemann, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, Donots, Dropkick Murphys, Element of Crime, Enter Shikari, Erol Alkan (performance cancelled), Faithless, Florence and the Machine, FM Belfast, Frank Turner, Frittenbude, Good Shoes, HORSE the Band, Hot Water Music, Ignite, Jack Johnson, Jennifer Rostock, Kap Bambino, Kashmir, Katzenjammer, K's Choice, La Roux, LaBrassBanda, LCD Soundsystem, Local Natives, Madsen, Mando Diao, Marina And The Diamonds, Massive Attack, Moneybrother, Mr. Oizo, Paramore, Phoenix featuring Richard Conwaaaaay, Porcupine Tree, Revolverheld, Shout Out Louds, Skindred, Skunk Anansie, Stone Temple Pilots, Tegan and Sara, The Blackout, The Bloody Beetroots, The Gaslight Anthem, The Get Up Kids, The Hold Steady, The Prodigy, The Specials, The Strokes, The Temper Trap, The XX, Timid Tiger, Turbostaat, Two Door Cinema Club, Vampire Weekend, We Are Scientists, White Lies, Zebrahead", "| Abby, Angus & Julia Stone, Apologies, I Have None, Arcade Fire, Augustines, Baauer, Bad Religion, Balthazar, Bastille, Belle & Sebastian, Bilderbuch, Blaudzun, Blood Red Shoes, Bombay Bicycle Club, Bonaparte, Bosse, Bring Me The Horizon, Broilers, Casper, Chuck Ragan, Chvrches, Circa Waves, Crookers, Current Swell, Dave Hause, Deaf Havana, Dillinger Escape Plan, Dispatch, Donots, Drenge, Dropkick Murphys, Duke Dumont, Ed Sheeran, Egotronic, Elbow, Family of the Year, Feine Sahne Fischfilet, Fettes Brot, Findus, Flogging Molly, Franz Ferdinand, Fucked Up, F\u00fcnf Sterne Deluxe, George Ezra, I Heart Sharks, Interpol, James Blake, Jennifer Rostock, Johnny Flinn, Kavinsky, Konvoy, Kraftklub, Lily Allen, London Grammar, Lykke Li, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Marcus Wiebusch, Marek Hemmann, Metronomy, Midlake, Moderat, Moonbootica, Pante\u00f3n Rococ\u00f3, Passenger, Pixies, Poli\u00e7a, Razz, Reignwolf, Rodrigo Y Gabriela, Royal Blood, Samaris, Seeed, Selah Sue, Skindred, Sonic.
