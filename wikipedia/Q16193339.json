He is member of the Society of Wildlife Artists (SWLA) since 1983.\nRose was born in Uganda where he lived until the age of six. After an education in the Rydens County Secondary School in Hersham, Surrey he studied biology at the University of Nottingham from 1979 to 1981 where he graduated to BSc. Unable to find work as a biologist he was offered a contract as illustrator for the Dorset Heritage Coast Project, where he worked until 1982. Between 2003 and 2009 he served on the board of governors of the Federation of British Artists and was secretary of the SWLA from 2009 to 2015.\nRose has illustrated several books about birds and other wildlife, including Robins and Chats (2015 by Rose and Clement) - an identification guide covering the 175 species of this family, A Handbook to the Swallows and Martins of the World (1989 by Angela Turner), Grebes of the World (2002 by Malcolm Ogilvie), and In a Natural Light, a book of his paintings with personal commentary on his own work (2005 by Rose). In addition he was among the illustrators of the Handbook of the Birds of the World, including volume 4, volume 6 to volume 12, volume 14, volume 16 and the special volume New Species and Global Index.\nRose now works purely as a painter, working chiefly in oils and acrylics, specialising in paintings of wildlife within the landscape.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Handbook of the Birds of the World", "response": ["Material in each volume is grouped first by family, with an introductory article on each family; this is followed by individual species accounts (taxonomy, subspecies and distribution, descriptive notes, habitat, food and feeding, breeding, movements, status and conservation, bibliography).
