Iris Chang adds that the Japanese government at that time was so faction-ridden that it would have been impossible to carry out such a plan in any case. Historian Meirion Harries  wrote that the Tanaka Memorial \"was one of the most successful 'dirty tricks' of the twentieth century \u2013 a bogus document so brilliantly conceived that thirty years later Westerns were still being taken in by it\". Likewise, historian William G. Beasley states that \"the nature of this document, as published variously in English and Chinese, does not carry conviction as to its authenticity\".. Dr. Haruo Tohmatsu, Professor of Diplomacy and War History of International Relations at the National Defense Academy of Japan, states that \"The 'Tanaka Memorial' never existed, but the Dalian conference of that year adopted resolutions that reflected these ideas.\"Haruo Tohmatsu, A Gathering Darkness (2004) SR Books, p. 18"]}, {"page": "Standard of living in Japan", "response": ["Collectively, trade unions (which engaged each year in a \u201cspring offensive\u201d to settle wages and bonuses) helped the bulk of the Japanese population to a share in the affluence brought by the expansion of national production. Real wages in manufacturing were nearly 50% higher in 1960 than they had been in 1934-36 (which was taken to be the prewar norm). In the next ten years they grew by another 80%, while those in commerce grew only a little more slowly. From 1955 to 1980, the amount of the average household budget spent on food fell from 44.5% to 27.8%, while the proportion spent on medical care, rent, and clothing also dropped, leaving more money for non-essentials such as extra education, consumer durables, and leisure.William G. Beasley, The Rise of Modern Japan.", "According to William G. Beasley, Japanese living standards were in many ways \u201cundoubtedly impressive by the 1980s: high real wages, low unemployment rates, excellent health care, above average consumption of goods and services\u201d. Nevertheless, a 1986 white paper found that in matters affecting the quality of life, Japan still lagged behind America and Europe. Nearly 75% of all power lines in Tokyo were still above ground, while only just over one-third of homes were connected to sewers. In 1985, only 36% of Japanese households had access to sewage facilities, compared with 65% in France (1975) and 97% in the United Kingdom (1976). Per capita park space in central Tokyo was only 2.2 square metres, compared with between 30 and 50 square metres in Washington, London, and Bonn. The ratio of roads to total area was also low in central Tokyo at 14%, compared with 17% in London and 20% in Paris.The Japan of Today, Published in 1989 by The International Society for Educational Information, Inc."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2006", "response": ["*William G.
