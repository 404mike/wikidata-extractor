A second son, born in the winter of 1864 while Georgiana became gravely ill with scarlet fever, died soon after birth. The family then moved to 41 Kensington Square, and their daughter Margaret was born there in 1866. In 1867 Burne-Jones and his family settled at the Grange, an 18th-century house set in a garden in North End, Fulham, London. For the 1870s Burne-Jones did not exhibit, following a number of bitterly hostile attacks in the press, and a passionate affair (described as the \"emotional climax of his life\") with his Greek model Maria Zambaco, which ended with her trying to commit suicide by throwing herself in Regent's Canal. During these difficult years Georgiana developed a friendship with Morris, whose wife Jane had fallen in love with Rossetti. Morris and Georgie may have been in love, but if he asked her to leave her husband, she refused. In the end, the Burne-Joneses remained together, as did the Morrises, but Morris and Georgiana were close for the rest of their lives.", "In 1866 Mrs Cassavetti commissioned Burne-Jones to paint her daughter, Maria Zambaco, in Cupid finding Psyche, an introduction which led to their tragic affair. In 1870, Burne-Jones resigned his membership following a controversy over his painting Phyllis and Demopho\u00f6n.thumb|Phyllis and Demopho\u00f6n, 1870 The features of Maria Zambaco were clearly recognisable in the barely draped Phyllis, and the undraped nakedness of Demopho\u00f6n coupled with the suggestion of female sexual assertiveness offended Victorian sensibilities. Burne-Jones was asked to make a slight alteration, but instead \"withdrew not only the picture from the walls, but himself from the Society.\"", "File:Edward Burne-Jones Maria Zambaco 1870.jpg|Portrait of Maria Zambaco, 1870"]}, {"page": "West Norwood Cemetery", "response": ["* many artists and entertainers, including: David Roberts, artist, George Stansbury, composer and operatic singer, William Collingwood Smith, painter, Joseph Barnby, composer and resident conductor at the Royal Albert Hall, Katti Lanner, ballet dancer, Paul Cinquevalli, juggler and actors E.
