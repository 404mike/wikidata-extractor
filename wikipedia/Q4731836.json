However, many see the Carmarthenshire-born satirical short-story writer and novelist Caradoc Evans (1878\u20131945) as the first\u2014or first modern\u2014Welsh writer in English. His short-story collections My People (1915) and Capel Sion (1916) were highly controversial, and Roland Mathias bitterly comments that \"No other Anglo-Welsh prose writer. .. displayed such ill will to Wales or to Welsh people\".Anglo-Welsh Literature, p.82. W. H. Davies (1871\u20131940), born in Newport, became famous principally for his The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp which was set mostly in North America. The principal themes in his work are observations about life's hardships, the ways in which the human condition is reflected in nature, his own tramping adventures and the various characters he met. In his poetry he was particularly inspired by birds, the weather and the seasons. His prose works were nearly all autobiographical and were sometimes, as with his 1918 \"A Poet's Pilgrimage (or A Pilgrimage In Wales)\", set in his homeland.

The decade also saw two important agitprop documentaries, Today We Live (1937) set among the unemployed miners of the village of Pentre in the Rhondda Valleys, and Donald Alexander's Eastern Valley (1937).
