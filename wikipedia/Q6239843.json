He was appointed the first Chair of Logic and Philosophy of Mind at the newly formed London University (now University College, London), a position he secured and held against his formidable opponents from 1829 to 1866.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Martineau", "response": ["In 1866, the Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College, London, fell vacant when the liberal nonconformist Dr John Hoppus retired. Martineau became a candidate, and despite strong support from some quarters, potent opposition was organised by the anti-clerical George Grote, whose refusal to endorse Martineau resulted in the appointment of George Croom Robertson, then an untried man. Martineau, however, sidestepped Grote's opposition, much as Hoppus had learnt to do during his Professorship, and developed a cordial friendship with Robertson."]}, {"page": "George Grote", "response": ["Mrs Grote claimed to have first suggested the History of Greece in 1823; but the book was already in preparation in 1822. In April 1826 Grote published in The Westminster Review a criticism of William Mitford's History of Greece, which shows that his ideas were already in order. From 1826 to 1830 he was hard at work with John Stuart Mill and Henry Brougham in the organization of University College London. He was a member of the council which organized the faculties and the curriculum. In 1830, owing to a difference with Mill as to an appointment to one of the philosophical chairs (Grote objected to John Hoppus), he resigned his position. He rejoined the council in 1849 and was appointed Treasurer in 1860, then President in 1868. In his will Grote left \u00a36000 as an endowment for the Chair of Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London.", "He is said, in some estimations, to have been a man of strong character and self-control, unfailing courtesy and unswerving devotion to what he considered the best interests of the nation. Other historians, such as Guy MacLean Rogers, consider he can reasonably be accused of anti-clerical bias. Grote's time on the Council at University College London was characterised by his contentious approach to two liberal nonconformists: John Hoppus and James Martineau, both of whom found ways to work around his opposition. Grote's life has attracted a wide variety of biographical comment due to his strong views."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* John Hoppus"]}, {"page": "Abney Park Cemetery", "response": ["Pioneering fire fighter James Braidwood, credited with forming the first municipal fire brigade; Edward Calvert, painter; engraver and painter and novelist Isabella Banks; newspaper editor and playwright George Linnaeus Banks; and the African-Jamaican Baptist missionary Rev.

The first Mind and Logic professorship was awarded to John Hoppus, a Congregational minister, who held the position from 1830 to 1866. George Grote, one of the college's founders and a member of its governing council, objected to the appointment on the grounds that the college was intended to be non-sectarian and that therefore a philosophy chair should not be held by a minister of religion. Because of this incident, Grote resigned from the council in 1830. In 1866 Grote, who had returned to the council in 1849, was instrumental in preventing the awarding of the chair to James Martineau, a Unitarian minister, for the same reasons. Grote's preferred candidate, George Croom Robertson, was appointed to the chair in 1867."]}, {"page": "John Scott Porter", "response": ["Porter was licensed in October 1825 by Bangor presbytery,  without subscription.
