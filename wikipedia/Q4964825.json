In an interview with Star Wars Insider Magazine, McQuarrie stated that Lucas's artistic direction was to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with Samurai armour. \"For Darth Vader, George [Lucas] just said he would like to have a very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind.\" McQuarrie noted that the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed to survive in the vacuum of space, and he proposed that Vader should wear some sort of space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie combined a full-face breathing mask with a  Samurai helmet, thus creating one of the most iconic designs of space fantasy cinema. A 1975 production painting of Darth Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller (a character prototype for Luke Skywalker) depicts Vader wearing black armour, a flowing cape and an elongated, skull-like mask and helmet. Its similarity to the final design of Vader's costume demonstrates that McQuarrie's earliest conception of Vader was so successful that very little needed to be changed for production. Working from McQuarrie's artwork, the costume designer John Mollo devised a costume that could be worn by an actor on-screen using a combination of clerical robes, a motorcycle suit, a German military helmet and a gas mask. The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armour used in the film from McQuarrie's designs."]}, {"page": "FedCon", "response": ["| Jason Isaacs - Brent Spiner - Jonathan Frakes - Robert Picardo - John de Lancie - Edward James Olmos \u2013 Mary McDonnell - Tricia Helfer - James Callis - Grace Park - Michael Trucco - Rekha Sharma - Tahmoh Penikett - Katee Sackhoff - Alessandro Juliani - Aaron Douglas - Michael Hogan - Kandyse McClure - Daphne Zuniga - Zach Galligan - Cliff Simon - Brian Muir - Hubert Zitt - Robert Vogel - Christian Humberg - Anika Kl\u00fcver - Lori Dungey "]}, {"page": "Keith Short", "response": ["* Brian Muir"]}, {"page": "Shepperton Design Studios", "response": ["This manufacturer made authentic Star Wars replica props and memorabilia, based in England.

It takes place in the same universe.

In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer. Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade, and Jason Momoa.
