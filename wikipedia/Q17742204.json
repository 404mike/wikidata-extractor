He went on to join Nantwich Town in February 2013 and then F.C. United of Manchester later in the year. He returned to the English Football League with Chesterfield in April 2014 and joined Oxford United in June 2017 following a spell on loan. He returned to Port Vale on loan in January 2018 and was loaned out to Cheltenham Town in January 2019, before joining the club permanently five months later. He helped Cheltenham to win promotion as champions of League Two in the 2020\u201321 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["In the January transfer window Aspin allowed two departures, plus Gavin Gunning left the club after rejecting a contract offer and centre-back Tom Anderson was recalled from his loan; incoming were non-league players Dior Angus, Luke Hannant and Callum Howe, as well as loanees Donovan Wilson, Zak Jules, Charlie Raglan and Kyle Howkins. Aspin remarked that the four centre-backs brought in did not cost the club much financially, and that he would have liked to have strengthened in other areas \"but for one reason or another it just hasn't happened\". However he managed to convert Cristian Monta\u00f1o from a winger to a left-back and Antony Kay from a centre-half to a central midfielder, and guided the club to safety with two games to spare. Vale ended the campaign in 20th-place \u2013 the joint-lowest finish in the club's history \u2013 with just one point above the relegation zone, having been out of the relegation zone on goal difference upon Aspin's arrival at the club."]}, {"page": "Aaron Martin (footballer, born 1989)", "response": ["On 25 June 2016, Martin joined League One club Oxford United on a two-year contract, citing manager Michael Appleton's style of play as a factor in his move to the Kassam Stadium. On 8 November, he took part in the longest penalty shoot-out in English professional football history, as Oxford were beaten 13\u201312 by Chelsea U23's in the Football League Trophy; Martin missed his penalty when the scores were level at 7\u20137. He struggled with minor injuries and was limited to 11 appearances in the first half of the 2016\u201317 campaign, before a ruptured Achilles tendon in December ruled him out for the remainder of the season. New manager Pep Clotet had stated that Martin would be one of four centre-backs in the 2017\u201318 season, along with Mike Williamson, Curtis Nelson and Charlie Raglan.

Vale suffered four consecutive defeats, before managing to turn things around by the end of the month with 1\u20130 wins over Rotherham United and Plymouth Argyle. On 14 February, midfielders Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall joined the club on non-contract terms. However the treatment room grew more busy, as Adam Yates and Tom Pope picked up injuries requiring several weeks of rest. The club expected to receive a boost when Trinidad and Tobago international Chris Birchall returned from the Los Angeles Galaxy to play for the club on a month-by-month basis; however the club were hit by a transfer embargo by the Football League on 25 February for failing to pay a bill. Nevertheless performances on the pitch were solid, and Vale entered the Crewe derby having won four and drawn one of their last five games. The derby finished honours even again at 1\u20131, with a late header from Byron Moore cancelling out the own goal scored by Crewe skipper David Artell. A 2\u20131 home defeat by Barnet on 10 March ended Vale's run of eight game unbeaten; combined with a ten-point deduction for entering administration, the club slipped from 9th to 14th in the space of 24 hours. Promising young defender Lee Collins was the first the leave the club post-administration, joining Championship side Barnsley on a loan deal worth \u00a350,000 to the Vale on 15 March. The drama continued in the game against Shrewsbury Town on 27 March, as the match was abandoned after 64 minutes due to a fire caused by the failure of the floodlights at the New Meadow. With the season drawing to a close, Adams began developing his squad for the following season, and announced that he had 'reluctantly' released defender Charlie Raglan, without giving him his first team debut. He offered contracts to all but three players: Chris Martin, Phil Roe, and Paul Marshall; he also placed Burge on the transfer list. Aside from Lee Collins, the first player to reject a contract with Vale to move elsewhere was Anthony Griffith, who signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. The first out-of-contract players to pledge their futures to Port Vale were Rob Taylor (two years), Lewis Haldane (six months), Ben Williamson (one year), and Sam Johnson (one year). Days later it was announced that Sean Rigg had signed with Oxford United, whilst Clayton McDonald confirmed that he would accept Vale's offer of a new one-year deal. However the biggest blow to fan's hopes of promotion came when it was announced that talismanic top-scorer Marc Richards had signed a two-year deal with relegated League One side Chesterfield. June began with John McCombe and Tom Pope both agreeing to sign new deals with the club. The only player to reject the club's offer of a new contract despite not signing a contract elsewhere was goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson; he eventually ended up at Burton Albion.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||23||align=\"left\"| Charlie Raglan", "|||Charlie Raglan", "|||Charlie Raglan"]}, {"page": "Raglan (surname)", "response": ["*Charlie Raglan (born 1993), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["| 8 April 2014 || DF ||  Charlie Raglan ||  FC United of Manchester || Free || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["With the transfer window closing on 1 September, Tony Humes made no further signings, but did tie down promising triallist goalkeeper Dillon Barnes to a permanent contract.

On 10 September, Colchester brought in forward Marvin Sordell on a contract until the end of the season after his release from Burnley earlier in the month. Sordell's signing was followed up by the loan arrival of Preston North End goalkeeper Jamie Jones on 11 September who joined for 93 days. Colchester's first league match for September followed on 12 September, with both new signings starting. The game was tipped to the U's advantage after 16 minutes when Chesterfield had Drew Talbot sent off, but it was Colchester who were first to concede with defender Daniel Jones putting the home side ahead with a free kick on 22 minutes. The U's responded with Gavin Massey's first goal of the season on 29 minutes, where the scores remained until half-time. In the second half, Colchester fell behind once again when Lee Novak scored from close range, before falling further behind on 74 minutes through captain Sam Morsy. The deficit was reduced two minutes later, with George Moncur scoring his second goal of the season.

Earlier in the day he made his second signing as manager, bringing in striker Dior Angus from non-league Redditch United. Meanwhile, Gavin Gunning left the club on the expiry of his contract, whilst Jack Stobbs, Rekeil Pyke and Tyler Denton returned to their parent clubs. In contrast, Whitfield's loan was extended until the end of the season. Gunning made his debut for Forest Green on 6 January, and kept a clean sheet as Rovers beat the Vale 1\u20130 with a goal from fellow d\u00e9butante Reuben Reid; Aspin apologized to supporters after the match for the team's performance. Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016. He also boosted the defensive numbers by bringing in centre-back Zak Jules on loan from Shrewsbury Town. Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall. A surprise departure was then announced, as Anderson was recalled early from his loan spell by Burnley.
