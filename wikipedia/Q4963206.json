During his 8-year tenure at the Church he developed both the music within the liturgy and the concert programmes. The choir, under his direction, focused on the performance of sixteenth, early seventeenth and twentieth century music, making records with Abbey Records and broadcasting on BBC Radio 3 and ITV. He also directed the music for the annual Dedication Service of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor which took place at St Bartholomew-the-Great where the Knights Bachelor Chapel was then situated. While at St Bartholomew's he re-founded the New English Singers in 1974 and he conducted concerts with the group in and around London with various instrumental groups including the English Consort of Viols. His work with adult chamber choirs continued and, in 1985, he founded the New Bedford Singers which he conducted for 10 years in concerts in the home counties.  At St Bartholomew-the-Great he directed several festivals, all of which were widely acclaimed in the national press both for the quality of the performances and the originality of the programmes. The Festival to celebrate the 850th Anniversary of the founding of St Bartholomew's Priory and Hospital in 1973 included performances by the London Bach Society under Paul Steinitz, the Schutz Choir of London under Roger Norrington, The Aeolian String Quartet and The King's Singers. The Queen's Silver Jubilee Festival in 1977, sponsored by The Stock Exchange, featured concerts by the New English Singers under Andrew Morris and the London Schubert Orchestra under Brian Brockless performing mostly twentieth century works."]}, {"page": "Pauline Brockless", "response": ["Brockless was born in Muswell Hill, north London, on May 4, 1929, the youngest of three children.
