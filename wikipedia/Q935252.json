Dr. Eissler prevented many well-meaning scholars from seeing many Freud documents claiming confidentiality, even when their donors had not requested nor demanded that confidentiality, nor was anyone a potential victim of the revelation of those documents. In 1974 the 65-year-old Dr. Eissler met Dr. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (born 1941), a 33-year-old Sanskrit scholar and psychoanalyst, at a meeting of the American Psychoanalytic Association. Eissler took a liking to Masson, appointed him his secretary, and meant to make him his successor at the Archives. Being an officer of the Sigmund Freud Archives Masson had 'administrative access' to all documents in the Archives, he was allowed to see anything he wanted breaking the seal whenever necessary. In 1981 Dr. Masson, who was then the Projects Director of the Archives, delivered a paper to the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society in New Haven, Connecticut. Dr. Masson said that Freud had abandoned his seduction theory\u2014the idea that adult neurosis is caused by childhood sexual abuse\u2014for personal rather than scientific reasons. By dropping the seduction theory, Dr. Masson concluded, \"Freud began a trend away from the real world that, it seems to me, has come to a dead halt in the present-day sterility of psychoanalysis throughout the world.\" Dr. Eissler was deeply shocked (\"Just today Masud Khan called me from London and asked me to dismiss you from the Archives. The board members, all of them, or at least most of them, are asking for the same.\")Eissler to Masson, p. 194 of Final Analysis and sought to dismiss Dr. Masson from his job at the Archives, which led to bilateral legal action and a well-publicized scandal."]}, {"page": "Schizoid personality disorder", "response": ["Descriptions of the schizoid personality as \"hidden\" behind an outward appearance of emotional engagement have been recognized since 1940, with Fairbairn's description of \"schizoid exhibitionism\", in which the schizoid individual is able to express a great deal of feeling and to make what appear to be impressive social contacts yet in reality gives nothing and loses nothing. Because they are \"playing a part\", their personality is not involved. According to Fairbairn, the person disowns the part they are playing, and the schizoid individual seeks to preserve their personality intact and immune from compromise. The schizoid's false persona is based around what those around them define as normal or good behaviour, as a form of compliance. Further references to the secret schizoid come from Masud Khan, Jeffrey Seinfeld and Philip Manfield, who give a description of an SPD individual who \"enjoys\" public speaking engagements but experiences great difficulty in the breaks when audience members would attempt to engage him emotionally. These references expose the problems in relying on outer observable behavior for assessing the presence of personality disorders in certain individuals."]}, {"page": "Donald Winnicott", "response": ["Winnicott rose to prominence as a psychoanalyst just as the followers of Anna Freud were in conflict with those of Melanie Klein for the right to be called Sigmund Freud's \"true intellectual heirs\".

As a result of his determined search for the unconscious meanings of emotional disturbance, he has reworked older psychoanalytic ideas and introduced major innovations in psychotherapeutic understanding and technique.\"Raney 1984, ix The articles of this collection aim to \"extend, criticize, and apply Langs's ideas in novel areas from their unique clinical perspectives\".Raney 1984, p. x Several widely known psychotherapists, such as Masud Khan, Merton Gill and Patrick Casement, contributed to this volume.
