According to Hunter Davies, \"the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends.\" Harrison's ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles \"all belonged to each other\" and admitted, \"George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it.\" Starr said, \"We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other.\" He added, \"there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there \u2013 a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational.\""]}, {"page": "Pete Best", "response": ["As Best's replacement, Starr accompanied the band on their second recording session with EMI at Abbey Road studios on 4 September 1962. George Martin initially refused to let Starr play, in that he was unfamiliar with Starr, and wanted to avoid any risk of his drumming not being up to par. On 11 September 1962, at the third EMI recording session, Martin used session musician Andy White on the drums for the whole session instead of Starr, as Martin had already booked White after the first session with Best. Starr played tambourine on some songs, while White played drums. Starr told biographer Hunter Davies years later that he had thought, \"That's the end. They're pulling a Pete Best on me.\"", "In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies opined that the firing of Best was \"one of the few murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done.\" Over twenty years later, Mark Lewisohn concluded that \"Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete ... The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now \u2013 as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured \u2013 he was out. It was the most underhanded, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power.\"", "Best decided to leave show business, and by the time of Hunter Davies' authorised Beatles biography in 1968, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles association. Years later he stated in his autobiography, \"the Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip that I had never really been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them\". This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that \"Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill. With his periodic illness.\" Starr added: \"He took little pills to make him ill.\" Best sued the Beatles for defamation of character, eventually winning an out-of-court settlement for much less than the $18\u00a0million he had sought."]}, {"page": "Kentish Town", "response": ["* Hunter Davies, writer"]}, {"page": "Dumfries", "response": ["BBC Broadcaster Kirsty Wark was born in the town as was fellow broadcaster Stephen Jardine.

Though Schwartz confirmed that Asher did see them in bed together, she claims that she was not the sole reason for the breakup, and that the couple were on the verge of separating prior to Asher's walking in. Authors Hunter Davies and Barry Miles state that the relationship always had several problems, one of them being that McCartney wanted Asher to give up her acting career after they married, which Asher refused to do. Another prevalent problem in the relationship was McCartney's drug use and frequent womanising. After returning to London from a five-month acting tour of the United States in May 1967, Asher found McCartney to be completely different, confiding in Davies that McCartney had \"changed so much. He was on LSD, which I hadn't shared. I was jealous of all the spiritual experiences he'd had with John. There were fifteen people dropping in all day long.

Robert Stephenson & Co. received orders for steam engines from the company, and Richardson suggested to Robert that he go to South America. To prepare for the trip Robert took Spanish lessons, visited mines in Cornwall and consulted a doctor, who advised that such a change of climate would be beneficial to his health. Robert had arrived in Liverpool on 8 June, and George was with him from 12 June. In his 1960 biography of the Stephensons, L.T.C. Rolt takes issue with earlier writers' suggestions that the assignment was solely due to Robert's health. Questioning why Robert left the locomotive construction company and his other work, he suggests that there must have been a disagreement between the Stephensons over George's business dealings. Later biographers, Hunter Davies (1975) and David Ross (2010), argue that Robert was seeking to assert his independence from the control of his father.

Impressed with the Maharishi, Harrison and Boyd, together with the other Beatles and their partners, travelled to a seminar he hosted in Bangor, Wales, the following day. Boyd and her sister Jenny then accompanied Harrison on the Beatles' visit to the Maharishi's ashram in Rishikesh, India, in February 1968. That same year, she told Beatles biographer Hunter Davies that the four Beatles had a bond that neither she nor any other wives could penetrate; she also said she wished that the band would use their fame and influence to publicly further a cause, as Marlon Brando had done on behalf of homeless children. Boyd provided inspiration for several of Harrison's Beatles compositions, including \"I Need You\", \"If I Needed Someone\", \"Love You To\", \"Something\" and \"For You Blue\".
