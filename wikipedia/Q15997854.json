He first contested a parliamentary election in 1918 as a Labour candidate for Shipley.

However this government collapsed in 1931 and the Labour Party split. At the ensuing general election in October 1931, Labour lost most of the seats it had won in 1929, including Snowden's.He did not contest another parliamentary election, but became a member of Keighley Borough Council, and was Mayor of Keighley in 1942\u201343.
