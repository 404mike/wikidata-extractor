Memorable victories over Derby County and Sheffield Wednesday highlighted the season for the sofa bound Millers. The 3-0 win over the Owls at the New York Stadium is the highest win-to-nil victory in the rivalry stretching back to the first game in the 1930's. The first ever double over the Owls was confirmed with Freddie Ladapo's last minute strike at Hillsborough. The 97th minute 20-yard strike is regarded as a modern lifelong memory. However, despite the best efforts of the Millers, coronavirus ravaged the Rotherham camp and caused a huge back log of fixtures. Rotherham effectively played Saturday-Tuesday from the end of January until the end of the season, including four games in the space of eight days. Rotherham took the season to the final day where a victory would see them survive if Sheffield Wednesday and Derby County drew with each other. The draw did indeed occur, but Rotherham suffered an 87th minute equaliser against Cardiff City, which was enough to keep Derby in the Championship and Rotherham to join Wycombe Wanderers and Sheffield Wednesday in League One for the 2021/22 season.", "* Record transfer fee: Freddie Ladapo from Plymouth Argyle"]}, {"page": "Grays Athletic F.C.", "response": ["|Freddie Ladapo, 14"]}, {"page": "Darren Moore", "response": ["On 1 March 2021, Moore left Doncaster with the club in the League One play-off positions to join Sheffield Wednesday, sitting inside the Championship relegation zone.

He would lose the following two games against Reading and Norwich City, but would pick up his first point in a 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town. On 20 March, he would pick up his first win in the local derby against Barnsley winning the game 2-1, thanks to two Jordan Rhodes goals. Prior to the game against Watford on 2 April 2021, it was announced that he wouldn\u2019t be in the dugout due to a positive Covid-19 test and would subsequently miss the games against Cardiff City and Queens Park Rangers. He would return to the dugout for the defeat against Swansea City, but he would suffer a setback a few days later in his recovery, developing pneumonia as a result of Covid-19. He would return to the dugout for the final game of the season and must win tie against Derby County on 8 May 2021.

This run coincided with the return of Kyle Letheren in between the sticks in place of Matt Macey. An injury to Letheren and a stop\u2013start March followed with Argyle winning late on against Shrewsbury Town at home, before giving away a 2\u20131 and then a 2\u20130 lead to Bristol Rovers and then Blackpool in the dying minutes to draw both matches.
