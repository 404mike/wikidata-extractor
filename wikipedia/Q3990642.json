Per Thomas Hodgkin, who translated the letter in 1886, the identification of Romulus in the letter as Romulus Augustus is strengthened by the name \"Romulus\" by this point not being very common and by the letter not giving the Romulus in question any titles or honorifics. The latter differs from the vast majority of other letters preserved from Theodoric, as if neither the king nor his scribe were quite sure how to address a former emperor. If the Romulus in the letter is the same person as Romulus Augustulus, it is possible that the letter indicates that Romulus and his family had to renegotiate their financial arrangements and pension with the king, seeing as they had been drawn up under the reign of a different king. Given that Romulus is not mentioned in accounts of the later eastern Roman invasion of Italy in the mid-530s, he had likely died some time before the conflict."]}, {"page": "Marcian", "response": ["Marcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize Avitus, who succeeded Maximus. Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian Hydatius states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian \"for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ( in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as Thomas Hodgkin, J. B. Bury, and William Bayless consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; Ernst Stein suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas Norman Baynes believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly. Classicist Courtenay Edward Stevens interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states."]}, {"page": "Austrasia", "response": ["* Thomas Hodgkin.

As a whole, the current scholarly consensus is that there is no conclusive site, merely being that it is in the vicinity of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (formerly called Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne) or Troyes. Historian Thomas Hodgkin located the site near M\u00e9ry-sur-Seine.

The earliest Christian source, and the nearest source in time to the events, says that it took place near the unidentified \"Transductine promontories\" (Transductinis promonturiis). Thomas Hodgkin, probably following Rodrigo Jim\u00e9nez de Rada, placed the battle at Jerez de la Frontera.Thomas Hodgkin (1887), \"Visigothic Spain\", The English Historical Review, 2:6 (April), 233. Rodrigo states that the battle took place ad fluvium qui Guadalete dicitur, prope Assidonam quae nunc Xeres dicitur: at the river called Guadalete, beside Sidonia, now called Xeres (quoted in Shaw, 223 n42). \"Sidonia\", probably the Roman Caesaris Asidona became Xeres-Sidonia to the Arabs and thence Jerez de la Frontera.
