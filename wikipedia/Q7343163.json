Cox had one known connection with one of the theatre companies of the era: he was one of ten men who tried to re-organize the King's Men in December 1648, an attempt that, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed.\nCox won his personal fame in writing and performing drolls \u2014 interludes or farces that usually consisted of comic scenes extracted and adapted from old dramas of English Renaissance theatre, by William Shakespeare (Bottom the Weaver was one droll), Ben Jonson, John Fletcher, and many others. Cox created at least eleven drolls, with titles like Simpleton the Smith, Bumpkin, Hobbinat, Simpkin, and John Swabber the Seaman.  As a performer, Cox was said to have been \"irresistible\" in his role of Young Simpleton.Cox performed most often at the Red Bull Theatre, long a center of popular entertainment. By some reports he bribed local officials into looking the other way when his drolls grew too much like plays. If so, he was not entirely successful in his corruption: Puritan authorities raided the Red Bull in June 1653 looking for unauthorized drama, and found Cox, playing Swabber. The gentry among the audience were required to pay five-shilling fines to exit.A selection of Cox's drolls, including Simpleton, Oenone, and Acteon and Diana, was published by the bookseller Edward Archer in 1656. Francis Kirkman printed some of Cox's drolls in his famous collections The Wits, or Sport upon Sport (1662, 1672).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1653 in literature", "response": ["*June \u2013 English actor Robert Cox is arrested at the Red Bull Theatre in London for performing a \"droll\" deemed to be a play (prohibited during the English Interregnum)."]}, {"page": "Red Bull Theatre", "response": ["The Red Bull is the only theatre incontestably associated with drolls, brief farces taken from the most popular older plays.
