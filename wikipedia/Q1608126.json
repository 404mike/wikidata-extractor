The objective was to venture beyond the northeast edge of Svalbard and also to search for Nordenski\u00f6ld's expedition which had not yet returned. On 13 June, Diana learned from a Norwegian fishing vessel at Danes Island that Nordenski\u00f6ld's expedition had been frozen in at Mosselbukta and  was starving.

The expedition undertook some exploring, but did not succeed in reaching much further than previously."]}]}}
