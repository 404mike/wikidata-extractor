Later, Barrie expanded the scene, on the premise that children were fascinated by pirates, and expanded the role of the captain as the play developed. The character was originally cast to be played by Dorothea Baird, the actress playing Mary Darling, but Gerald du Maurier, already playing George Darling (and the brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies), persuaded Barrie to let him take the additional role instead, a casting tradition since replicated in many stage and film productions of the Peter Pan story."]}, {"page": "1895 in literature", "response": ["*September 7 \u2013 The stage version of Trilby (see March 4) has its UK premi\u00e8re at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, with a London premi\u00e8re on October 30 at the Haymarket Theatre), with Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Dorothea Baird.
