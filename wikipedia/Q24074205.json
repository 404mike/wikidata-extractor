In April 2016, Celtic suffered a 5\u20134 loss on penalties to Old Firm rivals Rangers in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup, after a 2\u20132 extra-time draw in which Celtic fought back against the newly promoted Championship side twice to level the score. Three days later, Deila announced his resignation from his post once Celtic had finished the season. Nevertheless, Deila led Celtic to their fifth consecutive League championship, clinching the title on 8 May with a 3\u20132 win over nearest challengers Aberdeen. Celtic finished the season a week later with an emphatic 7\u20130 win over Motherwell, seeing Deila depart the club on a high note after two years in charge. The seventh goal in that game was scored by debutant Jack Aitchison, who at 16 years and 71 days old became both the youngest player ever to represent the club in a competitive match and the youngest goalscorer."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Celtic F.C. season", "response": ["|99||||FW||Jack Aitchison", "|align=center|Jack Aitchison"]}, {"page": "2017 UEFA European Under-17 Championship qualification", "response": ["* Jack Aitchison"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Celtic F.C. season", "response": ["|76||||FW||Jack Aitchison"]}, {"page": "Jack Aitchison (footballer, born 2000)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Aitchison"]}, {"page": "Karamoko Demb\u00e9l\u00e9", "response": ["On 3 October 2016, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 gained widespread media attention after making his debut for Celtic's under-20 side aged 13 playing with and against players who were up to seven age groups above him.
