His views and ideology have been linked to far-right political ideologies by academic and journalistic sources.\nHe has also been accused of promoting far-right conspiracy theories, and of being Islamophobic, although Murray himself has denied this and has expressed criticism of certain far-right figures and political parties.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pim Fortuyn", "response": ["However, other commentators such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, David Starkey and Douglas Murray have retrospectively defended some of Fortuyn's beliefs.

Teitelbaum described the present day version Sweden Democrats as paradoxical compared to other European nationalist parties on the issues of racism and radicalism. Teitelbaum notes that in contrast to other Nordic and wider European populist parties, the SD differs by having a past rooted in white nationalism and extremism, but in the present day is comparably more proactive in rejecting ethno-nationalism and expelling members who make racist statements to the point where he considers the SD to be on the \"softer side\" of national-populism. Similar observations were made by British conservative author Douglas Murray who described the SD as undergoing one of the most significant transformations on the European political right from a party on the fringes that openly pushed extreme tendencies to a more mainstream movement that draws on diverse support."]}, {"page": "Lord Alfred Douglas", "response": ["Of the six biographies of Douglas, the earlier ones by Braybrooke and Freeman were forbidden to quote from his copyright work, while De Profundis was unpublished.

Yet it is supremely rational to be scared of elements of Islam and of its fundamentalist strains in particular. Nevertheless, the term has been very successfully deployed, not least because it has the aura of a smear. Islamophobes are not only subject to an irrational and unnecessary fear; they are assumed to be motivated (because most Muslims in the West are from an ethnic minority) by \"racism\".

Dutton, in his party history, took a more qualified view, suggesting that in spite of Thorpe's bold style and charisma, \"the party drifted without a sense of conviction and underlying purpose\u00a0...

Thorpe positioned the Liberals in the \"moderate centre\", equidistant from Labour and Conservative, a strategy which was very successful in February 1974 when dissatisfaction with the two main parties was at its height, but which left the party's specific identity obscure, and its policies largely unknown."]}, {"page": "Ibn Warraq", "response": ["In October 2007, Warraq participated in an Intelligence Squared debate, \"We Should Not Be Reluctant to Assert the Superiority of Western Values,\" in London.
