His remarkable drawing skills were apparent from an early age, so that he enjoyed the royal patronage of King George III. After having exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1793, he enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools the following year, becoming a student of Benjamin West, another of the King's  prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and President of the Royal Academy. Even during these years of study, Delamotte chose to turn his attention to architectural and landscape work.\nFrom the Academy he moved to Oxford, depicting its buildings in numerous sketches. Many of his drawings were made into woodcuts by Orlando Jewitt of Headington.In 1803 he accepted the post of drawing-master at the newly established Royal Military College, Sandhurst, a position he held for forty years.\nBesides producing watercolours and a few oils, he turned to printmaking by way of etching, lithography and soft-ground etching.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
