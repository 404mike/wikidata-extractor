On the family's return to Sydney, Blackmore completed Primary School at Lane Cove West Primary School. Around age nine, he was deeply affected by a reading of Rudyard Kipling's horror story \"The Strange Ride of Morowbie Jukes\", by Lucy Boston's fantasy novel The Castle of Yew and terrified by the TV broadcast of Richard Matheson's \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" episode of The Twilight Zone.
