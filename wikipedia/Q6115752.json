Larwood took 6 for 32 in the Australian first innings, bowling at a speed that Wisdens S.J. Southerton described as \"faster than I have ever seen him\". According to Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas, this bowling, which included a spell of 3 wickets in 5 overs for 9 runs, delivered a lasting blow to Australian morale and was a major factor in England's ultimate series victory.Douglas, pp. 68\u201369 The match saw a low-key Test debut by Don Bradman, who scored 18 and 1 and was dropped for the second Test, before being rapidly reinstated for the third.Perry, pp. 86\u201392 and p. 97 England maintained their ascendancy during the second, third and fourth Tests, though with decreasing victory margins; Australia finally achieved success in the last match, giving England a 4\u20131 series victory.Swanton, p. 34 A combination of hard pitches, stifling heat, and long matches reduced Larwood's effectiveness as the tour progressed. He finished the Test series with 18 wickets at 40.22, behind George Geary (19 at 25.11) and Jack White (25 at 30.80). In all first-class matches on the tour, Larwood took 40 wickets at 31.35; as a batsman he scored 367 runs, averaging 26.21. Larwood's occasional tactic of bowling leg theory, that is, in the direction of the batsman's legs to a concentration of leg side fielders, had been noted by the Australian former bowler Arthur Mailey. In his report on the fourth Test, Mailey wrote, Larwood resorted to his \"famous leg theory\" after receiving severe punishment from the Australian batsman Archie Jackson, but the change brought no success: \"All theories and all bowlers were alike to [Jackson]\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 62"]}, {"page": "1928 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Leslie Ames, George Duckworth, Maurice Leyland, Sam Staples, Jack White"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Jack White"]}, {"page": "Adelaide Oval", "response": ["| 8/126 vs Australia ||  Jack White || 1929", "| 13/256 vs Australia ||  Jack White || 1934"]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| rowspan=3 | Jack White"]}]}}
