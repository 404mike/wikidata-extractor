He specialised in printing and distributing Protestant literature and pamphlets, and produced many small-format religious books, such as ABCs, sermons, and translations of psalms. He found fame, however, as the publisher of John Foxe's Actes and Monuments, also known as the Book of Martyrs, the largest and most technologically accomplished book printed in sixteenth-century England.Day rose to the top of his profession during the reign of Edward VI (1547\u20131553). At this time, restrictions on publishers were relaxed, and a wave of propaganda on behalf of the English Reformation was encouraged by the government of the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. During the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I, many Protestant printers fled to the continent, but Day stayed in England and continued to print Protestant literature. In 1554, he was arrested and imprisoned, presumably for these illicit printing activities. Under Queen Elizabeth I, Day returned to his premises at Aldersgate in London, where he enjoyed the patronage of high-ranking officials and nobles, including William Cecil, Robert Dudley, and Matthew Parker. With their support, he published the Book of Martyrs and was awarded monopolies for some of the most popular English books, such as The ABC with Little Catechism and The Whole Booke of Psalmes. Day, whose technical skill matched his business acumen, has been called \"the master printer of the English Reformation\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Athanasian Creed", "response": ["Early Protestants inherited the late mediaeval devotion to the Athanasian Creed, and it was considered to be authoritative in many Protestant churches.

It was performed at Cambridge and probably Oxford in the 1560s. The play was translated into French in 1562 and English in 1579. The latter translation was produced by Richard Day, son of the printer, John Day or Daye, who published Foxe's Actes and Monuments. Foxe's earliest extant literary creation is Titus et Gesippus (written in 1544), a Latin comedy based on Boccaccio. A series of letters in Foxe's handwriting dated to 1544\u201345, shows Foxe to be \"a man of friendly disposition and warm sympathies, deeply religious, an ardent student, zealous in making acquaintance with scholars.\"Mozley, p. 18. By the time he was twenty-five, he had read the Latin and Greek fathers, the schoolmen, the canon law, and had \"acquired no mean skill in the Hebrew language.\"Mozley, p. 20.", "After the death of Mary I in 1558, Foxe was in no hurry to return home, and he waited to see if religious changes instituted by her successor, Elizabeth I, would take root. Foxe was also so poor that he was unable to travel with his family until money was sent to him.Mozley, p. 61. Back in England, he seems to have lived for ten years at Aldgate, London, in the house of his former pupil, Thomas Howard, now Fourth Duke of Norfolk.Mozley, p. 62. Howard retained sincere affection for his tutor and left him a small pension in his will years later when Norfolk was executed for treason. Foxe quickly became associated with John Day the printer and published works of religious controversy while working on a new martyrology that would eventually become the Actes and Monuments.", "On 20 March 1563, Foxe published the first English edition of the Actes and Monuments from the press of John Day.Day's epitaph reads: \"He set a Foxe to write how martyrs run/By death to life. Foxe ventured pains and health/To give them light: Daye spent in print his wealth,/And God with gain restored his wealth again,/ And gave to him as he gave to the poor.\" (Mozley, p. 138) It was a \"gigantic folio volume\" of about 1800 pages, about three times the length of the 1559 Latin book.Mozley, p. 129. As is typical for the period, the full title was a paragraph long and is abbreviated by scholars as Acts and Monuments,The full title is \"Actes and Monuments of these latter and perilous days, touching matters of the Church, wherein are comprehended and described the great persecutions and horrible troubles that have been wrought and practised by the Romish prelates, specially in this realm of England and Scotland, from the year of our Lord 1000 unto the time now present; gathered and collected according to the true copies and writings certificatory, as well of the parties themselves that suffered, as also out of the bishops' registers, which were the doers thereof; by John Foxe.\" although the book was popularly known then, as it is now, as Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Publication of the book made Foxe instantly famous \u2013 \"England's first literary celebrity\" \u2013 although because there were then no royalties, Foxe remained as poor as ever although the book sold for more than ten shillings, three weeks' pay for a skilled craftsman.Mozley, p. 130; David Loades, \"The Early Reception\" .", "John Day's son Richard, who knew Foxe well, described him in 1607 as an \"excellent man... exceeding laborious in his pen... his learning inferior to none of his age and time; for his integrity of life a bright light to as many as knew him, beheld him, and lived with him\""]}, {"page": "Metrical psalter", "response": ["thumb|Music in Crowley's The Psalter of Dauid (1549)The first complete English metrical psalter and the first to include musical notation was The Psalter of Dauid newely translated into Englysh metre in such sort that it maye the more decently, and wyth more delyte of the mynde, be reade and songe of al men. Printed in 1549, it was the work of Robert Crowley and was printed by him, Richard Grafton and/or Stephen Mierdman. Crowley's psalter is a rare example of two-color printing (red and black on the first four leaves) in this era, which makes it visually resemble medieval manuscript psalters. (Christopher Tye and Francis Seager later included musical notation in their psalters, and the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter eventually incorporated a basic tune with the Anglo-Genevan edition of 1556. John Day's The Whole Book of Psalmes (1562) contained sixty-five psalm tunes.) Crowley also included a calendar for calculating feast days as in the Book of Common Prayer, to which Crowley's psalter appears to be intended as a supplement.", "Thomas Sternhold published his first, short collection of nineteen Certayn Psalmes between mid-1547 and early 1549. In December 1549, his posthumous : was printed, containing thirty-seven psalms by Sternhold and, in a separate section at the end, seven psalms by John Hopkins. This collection was taken to the Continent with Protestant exiles during the reign of Mary Tudor, and editors in Geneva both revised the original texts and gradually added more over several editions. In 1562, the publisher John Day brought together most of the psalm versions from the Genevan editions and many new psalms by John Hopkins, Thomas Norton, and John Markant to make up The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Collected into English Meter. In addition to metrical versions of all 150 psalms, the volume included versified versions of the Apostles' Creed, the Magnificat, and other biblical passages or Christian texts, as well as several non-scriptural versified prayers and a long section of prose prayers largely drawn from the English Forme of Prayers used in Geneva."]}, {"page": "Gorboduc (play)", "response": ["The first quarto, published by the bookseller William Griffith, was published 22 September 1565.Cauthen, I.

Seres and Day became partners in late 1547, and remained together until 1550. In 1547 they were working in Holborn Conduit in St Sepulchre's parish at the sign of the Resurrection, but as William Cecil's servant, Seres was able to acquire Peter College for his printing operation. This was a former chantry at St Paul's Cathedral, part of which became Stationers' Hall in 1554. Between 1549, when he became a member of the Stationers' Company, and 1551, when he was ordained, Crowley wrote eleven or twelve books, and edited, translated, or acted as printer or publisher of seven others (see below, Crowley's status as a printer).", "On the other hand, Peter M. W. Blayney contends that the revised STC erroneously indicates that Grafton printed Crowley's works. Blayney believes that the revisers realised that the ornamental \"A\" in Crowley's The baterie of the Popes Botereulx (1550): A6r (STC 21613) \"had once belonged to Grafton\", but they did not know that \"the person from whom Crowley borrowed it was almost certainly not Grafton but John Day, who apparently acquired it from Grafton in 1548 (STC 23004) and never returned it (2087.5, 6849.5, 7633.3, etc.)\". Additionally, Blayney suggests that the STC revisers were misled by another fact:", ":\"The three 'Crowley' books of 1549 seemingly were printed for him by others: STC 2725 by Stephen Mierdman (only); 6087 and 6094 by John Day. Also by Day is 6096 (dated 1550), while the double-dated 6095 was either printed partly by Day or partly by Crowley himself or (more likely) by Crowley alone but with a few ornamental initials borrowed from Day. All the other Crowley books of 1550\u201351 that I've seen are the work of Crowley alone\u2014as I assume are the only two I haven't seen, namely 2761.5 and 19897.3. Crowley also printed STC 25852 for Robert Stoughton, but without putting his name on it.\"", "Other sources suggest a link between Crowley and key aristocratic backers of reformism, such as William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester under Elizabeth. Crowley's associate John Day was long connected with Cecil. Some time between 1561 and 1564 Crowley was listed among twenty-eight \"godly preachers which have utterly forsaken Antichrist and all his Romish rags\", which was presented to Dudley."]}, {"page": "John Day", "response": ["John Day, John Daye or Jon Day may refer to:", "*John Day (Nova Scotia legislator) (died 1775), merchant and politician in Nova Scotia", "*John Day Jr. (died 1792), soldier and political figure in Nova Scotia", "*John Day (judge) (1797\u20131859), Liberian politician and judge", "*John Day (Indiana politician) (born 1937), Democratic member of the Indiana House of Representatives", "*John Day (Australian politician) (born 1955), Western Australian politician", "* John Day, Transport Workers Union of America Local 100 Vice President", "*John Day (cricketer, born 1812), English cricketer", "*John Day (horseman) (1819\u20131883), English jockey and trainer", "*John Day (cricketer, born 1881) (1881\u20131949), English cricketer", "*John Day (merchant) (fl. 1497\u201398), English merchant, author of a letter referring to existence of lost book Inventio Fortunata", "*John Day (printer) (c. 1522\u20131584), English Protestant printer, also known as John Daye", "*John Day (dramatist) (1574\u2013c. 1638), English dramatist", "*John Day (carpenter) (died 1774), first recorded death in a submarine", "*John Day (trapper) (c. 1770\u20131820), American hunter and trapper", "*John Day (architect) (fl. 1798\u20131802), Irish architect from County Wexford", "*John Day (priest) (1802\u20131879), clergyman in the Church of Ireland", "*John Day (botanist) (1824\u20131888), Victorian orchid collector and illustrator", "*John Day (historian) (1924\u20132003), American historian", "*John Day (computer scientist) (born 1947), ARPANET pioneer and early RFC contributor", "*John Day (RAF officer) (born 1947), British air marshal", "*John Day (Old Testament scholar) (born 1948), professor of Old Testament Studies", "*John Day, Oregon, a city ", "*John Day River, a tributary of the Columbia River in northeastern Oregon", "*John Day River (northwestern Oregon), a different tributary of the Columbia River", "*John Day (film), a 2013 Indian film", "*John Day Company, a New York publisher founded in 1926", "*John Day Dam, a dam on the Columbia River", "*John Day Fossil Beds National Monument"]}, {"page": "William Seres", "response": ["William Seres (d. 1579?)DNB was an English Protestant printer, starting work in about 1546, and working in partnership with John Day for a few years.

Like Crowley, Latimer was able to be especially outspoken when Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset had controlling influence in the court as Lord Protector of England during part of the minority of Edward VI. A famous sermon of Latimer's that represented preachers as God's plowmen, \"The Sermon of the Plowers,\" was delivered at St. Paul's Cross, 18 January 1548 and was printed that year by John Day. This was the last of four \"Sermons on the Plough;\" unfortunately the first three are lost. While Latimer's message is spiritual, it has a sharp political edge that also acknowledges the material concerns of people affected by enclosure. Latimer attacks idle clergy as \"plowmen\" who cause a spiritual famine, and enclosure is used as a metaphor for hindrances to proper preaching. The devil is called the busiest bishop and greatest plowman in England; he is seeding the land with the ritual and ornamental trappings of popery. Latimer himself, through the style of his sermons, typifies the plain, homely and direct speech of Piers and popular Protestantism. Anthony Anderson's The Shield of our Safetie (1581) uses Latimer's figure of the pastor as a plowman but is unwilling to ascribe special virtue to the commons and rural laborers. Godliness is lacking \"from top to toe\" in England, \"from the Nobilitie, to the Plowman and his mate.\" George Gifford's A Briefe Discourse of Certaine Points of the Religion which is among the Common Sort of Christians (1583) asserts that \"it is not for plowmen to meddle with scriptures.\""]}, {"page": "John Bon and Mast Parson", "response": ["John Bon and Mast Parson is a literary work printed in 1547 or 1548 by John Day and William Seres as the work of \"Lucas Shepeherd\", possibly a pseudonym.
