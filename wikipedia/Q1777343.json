The author of the Memoriale lived in the reign of Edward I, and mentions the homage done to Edward as overlord of Scotland (1291).Since the main narrative extends only to 1225, the Memoriale is emphatically a second-hand production. But for the years 1201-1225 it is a faithful transcript of a contemporary chronicle, the work of a Barnwell canon. A complete text of the Barnwell chronicle is preserved in the College of Arms' (Heralds' College, manuscript 10) but has never yet been printed, though it was collated by Bishop Stubbs for his edition of the Memoriale. The Barnwell annalist, living in Cambridgeshire, was well situated to observe the events of the barons' war, and is our most valuable authority for that important crisis.He is less hostile to King John than are Ralph of Coggeshall, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. He praises the king's management of the Welsh and Scottish wars; he is critical in his attitude towards the pope and the English opposition; he regards the submission of John to Rome as a skilful stroke of policy, although he notes the fact that some men called it a humiliation. The constitutional agitation of 1215 does not arouse his enthusiasm; he passes curtly over the Runnymede conference, barely mentions Magna Carta, and blames the barons for the resumption of war. It may be from timidity that the annalist avoids attacking John, but it is more probable that the middle classes, whom he represents, regarded the designs of the feudal baronage with suspicion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Canterbury Cathedral", "response": ["The shrine in the Trinity Chapel was placed directly above Becket's original tomb in the crypt. A marble plinth, raised on columns, supported what an early visitor, Walter of Coventry, described as \"a coffin wonderfully wrought of gold and silver, and marvellously adorned with precious gems\". Other accounts make clear that the gold was laid over a wooden chest, which in turn contained an iron-bound box holding Becket's remains. Further votive treasures were added to the adornments of the chest over the years, while others were placed on pedestals or beams nearby, or attached to hanging drapery. For much of the time, the chest (or \"feretory\") was kept concealed by a wooden cover, which would be theatrically raised by ropes once a crowd of pilgrims had gathered. The Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, who visited in 1512\u20131514, recorded that, once the cover was raised, \"the Prior ... pointed out each jewel, telling its name in French, its value, and the name of its donor; for the principal of them were offerings sent by sovereign princes.\""]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Alba", "response": ["After David I, and especially in the reign of William I, Scotland's kings became ambivalent about, if not hostile towards, the culture of most of their subjects.

After David I, and especially in the reign of William I, Scotland's Kings became ambivalent about the culture of most of their subjects.William I was known as Uilleam Garbh (i.e. \"William the Rough\") in the contemporary Irish annals e.g. Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1214.6; Annals of Loch C\u00e9, s.a. 1213.10.

The names of neither his father nor his mother are known, but he had two known brothers, with the names Helia and Henry, and a cousin, also called Helia. The names suggest that his family were of French, or at least Anglo-Norman origin, rather than being a Scot or native Anglo-Saxon.Norman F. Shead, \"Jocelin\", p. 2. There are some indications that his family held land in South Lanarkshire, namely because they seem to have possessed rights in the church of Dunsyre.A. A. M. Duncan, \"Jocelin (d. 1199)\", in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 Nov 2006. It is unlikely that he would have thought of himself as \"Scottish\". For Jocelin's contemporary and fellow native of the Borders, Adam of Dryburgh, this part of Britain was still firmly regarded as terra Anglorum (the \"Land of English\"), although it was located inside the regnum Scottorum (the \"Kingdom of the Scots\").The full Latin description is \"in terra Anglorum et in regno Scottorum\", Adam of Dryburgh, De tripartito tabernaculo, II. 210, tr. Keith J. Stringer, \"Reform Monasticism and Celtic Scotland\", in Edward J. Cowan & R. Andrew McDonald (eds.), Alba: Celtic Scotland in the Middle Ages, (East Lothian, 2000), p. 133. This would be no obstacle to Jocelin, however. His Anglo-French cultural background was in fact probably necessary for the patronage of the King of Scots. As Walter of Coventry wrote of King William's era, \"the modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude\".W.

Brewer; and the Materials for the History of St Thomas Becket by James Craigie Robertson."]}, {"page": "Scone, Scotland", "response": ["Scone's role therefore came under threat as Scotland's twelfth century kings gradually became more French and less Gaelic. Walter of Coventry reported in the reign of William I of Scotland that \"The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude.\"Stubbs (1872), p. 206. Though exaggerated, there was truth in this. Apparently for this reason, when the Normanized David I of Scotland () went to Scone to be crowned there in the summer of 1124, he initially refused to take part in the ceremonies. According to Ailred of Rievaulx, friend and one time member of David's court, David \"so abhorred those acts of homage which are offered by the Scottish nation in the manner of their fathers upon the recent promotion of their kings, that he was with difficulty compelled by the bishops to receive them.\"Anderson (1908), p. 232; Ailred was keen to portray David as a good Anglo-Norman, and was anxious to relieve David of anti-Scottish prejudice being made to debase his image in the Anglo-Norman world. Inevitably then this was bound to affect the significance of Scone as a ritual and cult centre, yet the inauguration ceremony was preserved with only some innovation through the thirteenth centuryBannerman (1989); for some of the innovations, see Duncan (2003). and Scottish kings continued to be crowned there until 1651, when Charles II became the last King of Scotland to have a coronation there (see List of Scottish monarchs).James II of Scotland was not crowned there, but at Holyrood Abbey; he was however a child, and there were political problems which made Scone too dangerous. His son James III of Scotland, who succeeded as a child also, was not apparently crowned there either; however, these coronations did not reverse the ancient precedent, which was \"revived\" by James IV of Scotland. Moreover, until the later Middle Ages kings continued to reside there, and parliaments, often some of the most important parliaments in Scottish history, frequently met there too.See McNeill & MacQueen (1996), pp. 159\u2013182, for places of charter issue."]}, {"page": "Barnwell chronicler", "response": ["*Walter of Coventry"]}, {"page": "Knights Templar in England", "response": ["An inventory by Geoffrey Fitz Stephen reveals that by 1185, the Order of the Knights Templar had extensive holdings in London, Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Salop, Oxfordshire, Cornwall, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.

He was severely punished by his contemporary Master."]}, {"page": "John, Archbishop of Esztergom", "response": ["It is possible that John was present in England on 7 July 1220, when Thomas Becket's remains were moved from his first tomb to a shrine, in the recently completed Trinity Chapel.

This archbishop may have been John, at whose seat in Esztergom there was a provostry erected in the honour of Thomas Becket. Due to John's advanced age, historian G\u00e1bor Thoroczkay considers Walter's narration refers to Ugrin Cs\u00e1k of Kalocsa, who was much younger than John. Beside John or Ugrin, Desiderius of Csan\u00e1d also attended the celebration, who was robbed by burghers of Pavia on his way back."]}, {"page": "Desiderius, Bishop of Csan\u00e1d", "response": ["Desiderius accompanied King Andrew II to his first campaign against the Principality of Halych to recapture the province in 1205 or 1206.

Desiderius was present in England on 7 July 1220, when Thomas Becket's remains were moved from his first tomb to a shrine, in the recently completed Trinity Chapel.

According to a bull of Pope Honorius III issued on 15 December 1220, Desiderius was robbed by burghers of Pavia when, in the course of a pilgrimage, he travelled through the city on his way back to Hungary. The document narrates the burghers misidentified him with Alexander, Bishop of V\u00e1rad, who owed significant amounts to them, and seized his golds, horses, clothes and carriage. Pope Honorius called on Alexander to compensate Desiderius for the grievances he had suffered. Historian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Solymosi considers Desiderius was able to participate in the pilgrimage in England because of his affiliation with the Cistercians and for the similar martyrdom of Gerard of Csan\u00e1d and Thomas Becket."]}]}}
