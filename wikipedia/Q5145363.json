Amies' early pieces showed his lack of experience; later he would describe some of them as hideous and extravagant. In 1937, however, his tweed suit called 'Panic' scored a huge hit. Cecil Beaton photographed the suit for Vogue; it had padded hips, a nipped in waist (Amies had introduced corsets to the collection) and was made in green Linton tweed with a cerise pink check. By the time war broke out, Amies was designing the whole Lachasse collection."]}, {"page": "Edward Rayne", "response": ["Edward Rayne was educated at Harrow School but left at the age of 16 because his eyesight was threatened by cataracts in both eyes.

Physical comparisons were also drawn with Sergeant Bilko. He was excused from active service in the war because of this, and began a long apprenticeship at H. & M. Rayne's factory in King's Cross. His obituary in The Times noted that he would arrive at 7.45\u00a0am every morning to learn the 200 steps required to make a pair of high-end shoes.

Colin McDowell said that almost uniquely for a personality in the centre of the fashion industry, no journalist ever had a bad word to say about him.
