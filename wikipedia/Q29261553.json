She left school at fifteen influenced by a punk DIY spirit getting involved with Anti Fascist groups such as AFA and was involved in the Anti-Apartheid Movement. She co-founded the first South Asian LGBTTQ campaigning organisation, Shakti, in 1987 and also co-founded the first HIV / AIDs charity in India, the Naz Foundation International in 1991 with Shivananda Khan.
