Consider ecopsychology and transpersonal psychology. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled radical psychology and liberation psychology.

This method can be used in participant observation studies or when conducting interviews. Member-checking and triangulation are good methods to use when conducting participant observations, or any other form of qualitative research, because they increase data and research conclusion credibility and transferability. In quantitative research, credibility is liken to internal validity,Banister, Peter, Geoff Bunn, and Erica Burman. 2011. Qualitative Methods In Psychology: A Research Guide.

There is a reflection on this in the opening chapter by him of Critical Discursive Psychology, and Marxist ideas are outlined (alongside psychoanalysis, post-structuralism and feminism) in a paper 'Discursive resources in the Discourse Unit' written for the Discourse Unit, a research group which he founded with Erica Burman.  Recent interviews indicate that feminist arguments have become more important to Parker, and that Marxism itself may not provide a complete true theory (or alternative to psychology). The discipline of psychology is now treated as an ongoing process of 'psychologisation' operating within institutions suffused with the power to define and manage individual behaviour and experience. This argument is outlined in the book Revolution in Psychology (2007)."]}, {"page": "Discourse Unit", "response": ["The centre runs short courses, including \"Discursive Practice\" (which has had an important impact on the development of critical discourse analysis inside and outside the UK) and \"Critical Psychology\".

Graduates of courses run by the Discourse Unit now work in a number of countries, including Brazil, Canada, China, Portugal, Germany, Greece, Sweden, South Africa, Spain and the United States.

In those cases, Parker suggests that we would then need to speak of 'discursive repertoires' or 'discursive templates'. His main concern, he argues, is with the role of psychoanalysis in relation to psychology, and he adopts the argument made by Erica Burman that psychoanalysis is the 'repressed other' of psychology. In this way he hopes to make psychoanalysis be of relevance to critical psychology without simply replacing psychology with psychoanalysis."]}, {"page": "Annual Review of Critical Psychology", "response": ["The Annual Review of Critical Psychology is a peer-reviewed academic journal in the field of critical psychology.

In a similar vein, Dominic Strinati has presented the press interest in Operation Irma as evidence of a popular appetite for news stories that resemble the structure and tone of fictional narratives on war: \"War films work most effectively\u00a0... by stripping back the too easily confusing contextual details of a conflict and focusing instead on the 'existential' problem of the protagonist's experience \u2013 the problem of being human in dehumanising circumstances\u00a0... News reporting \u2013 in this case from the Balkans \u2013 then has to compete even at the level of basic comprehension with this already established way of understanding things\u00a0... It may not be surprising, therefore, that one of the most memorable news 'stories' to come out of Bosnia was that of Irma, a rescued child.\" The operation has also been portrayed as representative of a trend whereby public reaction to media coverage of disasters leads and shapes official state response, even precipitating the creation of policy where none has existed before. Erica Burman, developing this theme, has argued that Irma Had\u017eimuratovi\u0107 became an \"emotional focus\" for a British public dismayed by its government's ambiguous and cautious attitude to the conflict in Bosnia:"]}, {"page": "Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party", "response": ["In February 2019, over 200 Jewish members and supporters of the Labour Party signed a letter published in The Guardian, calling the party under Corbyn an \"a crucial ally in the fight against bigotry and reaction\" and Corbyn's campaigning consistently in support for \"initiatives against antisemitism\".
