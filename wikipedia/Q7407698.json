The Saints continued this good form until Thorpe was injured in late December, to be replaced by Sam Jepp. With other key players such as Arthur Hughes and Frank Jefferis also suffering with injuries, Saints fell away until Thorpe's return at the end of March. Saints won four and drew three of the last seven games, and managed to finish in third place."]}, {"page": "Bert Trueman", "response": ["He was recruited by the \"Saints\" as replacement for the former England international Harry Hadley who had just retired from professional football. Despite being considered too small to be a half-back, Trueman soon proved that his judgement and skill made up for his lack of height and he showed himself to be \"quick, resourceful and decisive in action (who was) overall a most difficult obstacle for opposing forwards\". His debut came on 7 September 1908 in a 4\u20131 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, when Frank Jefferis scored a hat-trick. He soon became established at left-half, alongside Frank Thorpe or Sam Jepp in the centre and John Johnston on the right, although Trueman was able to play in any of the half-back positions. In the 1908\u201309 season, Trueman made 31 league appearances, with Southampton finishing third in the table, having led the table until a run of injuries to key players such as Thorpe and Jefferis in mid-season disrupted the side."]}, {"page": "Frank Monk", "response": ["He joined Southampton of the Southern League on amateur terms in the summer of 1910. His teaching commitments prevented him from playing regularly for the \"Saints\" and he made his debut after seven games of the 1910\u201311 season, when he took the place of Sam Jepp at centre-half against Crystal Palace on 22 October 1910. When he played, \"he used his athleticism to good effect\" and was a sure tackler. He managed 19 league appearances, with either Jepp or Billy Beaumont taking his place when he was unavailable. On 11 February 1911, he played as an emergency centre-forward at Swindon Town."]}, {"page": "Bert Dyer", "response": ["He spent most of his career at The Dell in the reserves and made his solitary first-team appearance at Northampton Town on 6 April 1907 when Sam Jepp was taken ill shortly before kick-off. Dyer played at inside-right with Frank Jefferis moving to the left and Wally Radford moving into the centre-forward position. The match finished 4\u20132 to Southampton, with two goals from Radford and one each from Patten and Mouncher."]}, {"page": "1912\u201313 Swansea Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|12||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sam Jepp"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Sam Jepp, footballer, was born in Aldershot"]}, {"page": "Jepp", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Jepp"]}]}}
