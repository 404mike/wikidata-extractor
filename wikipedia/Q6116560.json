Along with Joe Cockroft, he was an ever-present for the club during the 1933\u201334 season.Morton had previously played for Woodburn Council School and Woodhouse Alliance, and signed pro with Gainsborough aged 17.He gained a solitary cap for England in a 5\u20134 victory over Czechoslovakia on 1 December 1937, in which he scored the second England goal (Stanley Matthews scored his only international hat trick in this match).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Morton", "response": ["*Jackie Morton (John Morton, 1914\u20131986), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Eric Brook", "response": ["Brook's 'workmanlike' p29 club form earned him a call up to the England team in 1929 and he made his first appearance for his nation against Ireland. His debut performance for England was described as 'decidedly promising'. Brook went on to play for England a total of 18 times, scoring 10 goals. He may have played more times for his country, but faced competition, primarily from Arsenal's Cliff Bastin (who received 21 caps), but also from others, such as Aston Villa's Eric Houghton (who received 7 caps), Sheffield Wednesday's Ellis Rimmer (who received 4 caps) and West Ham's Jimmy Ruffell (who received six caps) and Jackie Morton (who received one cap). However, the versatility of Brook and Bastin meant that they often played together for England, usually with Bastin playing in the inside left position (in a game against Scotland in 1935 Bastin played at inside right). When they played together, Brook and Bastin would interchange at will, switches which often confused opposition defences. p96 Despite the rivalry, Brook and Bastin were in the latter's words 'always the greatest of friends'. The only players to have scored more goals for England, prior to the second world war, who did not play in the centre forward or inside forward positions were Cliff Bastin and Charles Bambridge. Only twelve players in total scored more goals for England than Brook prior to the war. In addition to playing for England, Brook often competed in trial matches for the Rest of England against the national team.", "In the 1938 British Home Championship Brook played alongside City teammate Sam Barkas in a 5\u20131 victory over Ireland. Brook's goal in the 75th minute was to be the last for his national team. One journalist stated that Brook was 'elusive and full of energy' within the game and that 'his roving commission frequently misleads defences'. Brook made his final appearance for England in a 2\u20131 victory over Wales in which his perfect pass set up Willie Hall to score the winning goal. One Scottish journalist, who attended the game, described Brook's performance in the game as 'brilliant'. England won the championship that season. Brook was called up to play for England in a game against Czechoslovakia in December 1937, which England won 5\u20134, but withdrew due to peritonitis and was replaced by West Ham's Jackie Morton. Czechoslovakia's football officials expressed regret that Brook was not able to play. Similarly, Brook was selected to play for England in a game against Scotland in April 1939, which England won 2\u20131, but withdrew due to a groin injury (which he sustained playing for City against Bury) and was replaced by Huddersfield Town's Pat Beasley. One journalist was not surprised by Brook's recall to the England team in 1939, stating that 'I have seen all the English forwards lately, and he was the best of the lot'."]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. players", "response": ["| Jackie Morton", "|Jackie Morton"]}, {"page": "Millwall F.C.\u2013West Ham United F.C. rivalry", "response": ["Between 1919 and 1929 the clubs played each other 11 times in the London Professional Footballers' Association Charity Fund and the London Challenge Cup, with West Ham winning five games, Millwall winning three, and three drawn.
