He researched and lectured at King's College London for 25 years, authoring or co-authoring about 100 papers, and then became Science Writer in Residence at Imperial College London in 1990. From 1997 to 2002 he was Science Writer in Residence at the Department of Chemistry at Cambridge University, England, during which time he started and wrote the newsletter Chem@Cam. \nHe is the author of more than 12 books and several of them have been translated into other languages.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Extended periodic table", "response": ["The number of physically possible elements is unknown. A low estimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected to center on Z\u00a0=\u00a0126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by the proton and the neutron drip lines and stability toward alpha decay and spontaneous fission. One calculation by Y. Gambhir et al., analyzing nuclear binding energy and stability in various decay channels, suggests a limit to the existence of bound nuclei at Z\u00a0=\u00a0146. Some, such as Walter Greiner, predicted that there may not be an end to the periodic table. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include Z\u00a0=\u00a0128 (John Emsley) and Z\u00a0=\u00a0155 (Albert Khazan)."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Chemistry", "response": ["The events have attracted notable science writers such as Philip Ball, Antony John Williams, and John Emsley to give public lectures."]}, {"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["* (1995) The Consumer\u2019s Good Chemical Guide, John Emsley"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Science writers", "response": ["*John Emsley (website)"]}, {"page": "Hennig Brand", "response": ["* John Emsley, The Shocking History of Phosphorus, 2000, "]}, {"page": "Brian Inglis", "response": ["In 1978, the science writer John Emsley published an article on thallium which suggested that William Crookes endorsement of the medium Florence Cook and spiritualism may have been the result of mental disturbance caused by thallium poisoning.John Emsley.
