He was appointed as club captain, after impressing in the pre-season. At twenty one years of age, and new to the club, his appointment came as a surprise to some, especially with more senior options in Sam Stockley, Marc Richards and Gareth Owen. However, Adams had faith in the young midfielder's vocal abilities and general leadership qualities. Putting in solid performances in Vale's unbeaten start to the season, he took to the field despite still suffering with an ankle injury. His first goal for the club seemed to come in a 4\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town on 5 September. However, after the match Marc Richards claimed the last touch and therefore took the credit for the goal. Fraser seemed to attract violence; on 25 August, Sheffield Wednesday's Francis Jeffers was sent off for head-butting Fraser, two weeks later Fraser and Aldershot Town captain John Halls almost came to blows before the match had even begun. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. He remained club captain and a first team regular though, striking up a midfield pairing with Anthony Griffith, who he also shared a house with. His performances as captain earned him public praise from assistant manager Geoff Horsfield, though the fans were critical at times of his inconsistency. He found himself the new focus of disgruntled supporters in early 2010, following Danny Glover's demotion to the reserves, and Marc Richards' rising goal tally. Fraser vowed to ignore the booing. He also retained the captain's armband for the next season, and vowed \"to be more mature both on and off the pitch\" in order to be a better captain."]}, {"page": "Luke Prosser", "response": ["Following an injury to Gareth Owen in March 2009, Prosser was given an opportunity to affirm his place in the team, and hoped to earn a new contract at the end of the 2008\u201309 season.

However, two months later he was transfer listed by new manager Micky Adams in August 2009 along with five other young players, having failed to impress in pre-season. He swiftly joined Conference Premier club Salisbury City on a one-month loan deal along with teammate Danny Glover. The pair made their debuts as substitutes in a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at the Raymond McEnhill Stadium on 15 August 2009. After playing six games for Salisbury, Prosser's loan was extended for a further month on 8 September 2009. He was recalled by Adams in October 2009, though he had to settle for a place on the bench, behind the first choice centre-halves. Another injury to Gareth Owen allowed Prosser to return to the first eleven for a league clash with Rotherham United on 14 November 2009. In an eventful first half, Prosser scored his first professional goal with a close ranger header, before being sent off for two bookable offences. In March 2010, he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract by Port Vale at the end of the season.
