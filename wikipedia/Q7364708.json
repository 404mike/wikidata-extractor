He was promoted to captain in 1952 and retired with the honorary rank of major in 1960. After leaving the army he worked as a mathematics lecturer in the Belfast College of Technology.Bunting's first involvement with politics was as election agent to Republican Labour Party MP Gerry Fitt, although he broke from Fitt and became a close associate of Ian Paisley, playing a leading role in Paisley's campaigns against the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, as well as running unsuccessfully for the Protestant Unionist Party in the Northern Ireland general election of 1969 in Belfast Victoria.Bunting had his own Ulster loyalist strong-arm group which he dubbed the Loyal Citizens of Ulster. The LCU, which existed between 1968 and 1969, was little more than another name for the East Belfast arm of the Ulster Protestant Volunteers.As head of this group, Bunting led the protests against many civil rights marches, most notably the 1969 Belfast to Derry civil rights march organised by People's Democracy, which resulted in a particularly bloody confrontation at Burntollet. In a fiery court case in 1969, Bunting was sentenced to three months' imprisonment along with Paisley for his role in the disturbances.Bunting's son Ronnie would go on to serve as a member of the Official Irish Republican Army and the Irish National Liberation Army before he was shot dead by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in 1980. Following his son's death, Major Bunting took no further role in politics but later told an inquest he felt his son was killed because of his belief in social justice.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Paisley", "response": ["On 30 November 1968, hours before a civil rights march in Armagh, Paisley and Ronald Bunting arrived in the town in a convoy of cars.

On 25 March 1969, Paisley and Bunting were jailed for organising the illegal counter-demonstration.A Chronology of the Conflict \u2013 1969 . Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN).

He reported that in Major Ronald Bunting's Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV), there was definite evidence of dual membership by Special Constables, of which he said \"we consider highly undesirable and not in the public interest\".  He also remarked that although \"recruitment is open to both Protestant and Roman Catholic: in practice we are in no doubt that it is almost if not wholly impossible for a Roman Catholic recruit to be accepted.\""]}, {"page": "Protestant Irish nationalists", "response": ["Ronnie Bunting, son of Ronald Bunting, a close associate of Ian Paisley, became a member of the Official IRA in the early 1970s and was a founder-member of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in 1974.

His father, Ronald Bunting, had been a major in the British Army and Ronnie grew up in various military barracks around the world. Ronnie's father became a supporter and associate of Ian Paisley and ran for election under the Protestant Unionist Party banner."]}, {"page": "John McKeague", "response": ["The violence of the SDA was accompanied by equally violent rhetoric from McKeague as he boasted that the group possessed \"hundreds of guns\" and vowed that \"we will see the battle through to the end\". His militant stance won him the public support of Ronald Bunting, who like McKeague had earlier been associated with Paisley but had since broken from him. In November 1969, McKeague was cleared of a charge of conspiracy to cause explosions. He was, however, sentenced to three months' imprisonment for unlawful assembly. McKeague's absence on remand for the initial charges saw his stock fall on the Shankill, where he was already mistrusted due to being from east Belfast and where his reputation had been further blackened by supporters of his former friend Ian Paisley.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 15 Leaving the Shankill he attempted to set up a group similar to the SDA on the Donegall Road but was declared persona non grata by the head of an existing local Defence Committee, who was a loyal Paisleyite. This, combined with a rumour that McKeague was a \"fruit\", saw him abandon all initiatives in the west and south of the city and concentrate on east Belfast. The SDA continued in his absence until 1971, when it merged with other like-minded vigilante groups to form the Ulster Defence Association (UDA)."]}, {"page": "William Long (Northern Ireland politician)", "response": ["In December 1968, Long was promoted to Minister of Home Affairs.  Initially, he was minded to move to repeal legislation permitting detention without trial. Two weeks after his appointment, People's Democracy activists launched their Belfast-to-Derry march, calling for electoral and legal reform, action to reduce unemployment and to provide decent homes.  Long met with Ian Paisley and Ronald Bunting, who called on him to ban the march.  Long refused to so, and the march set off.  It was attacked by loyalists on several occasions, finally at Burntollet Bridge where there were numerous injuries.  Long claimed that Paisley and Bunting had not \"threatened or hinted that their followers would cause any trouble in Derry\", and claimed that Paisley's supporters had not participated in the violence.  The Belfast Telegraph disputed this, and claimed that Long was being partisan."]}, {"page": "Burntollet Bridge incident", "response": ["The march had been called in defiance of an appeal by Northern Ireland Prime Minister Terence O'Neill for a temporary end to protest.
