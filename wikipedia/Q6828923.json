Fortunately the fire was spotted by one of the vergers allowing a swift response by emergency services. The timing was particularly unfortunate, for a complete restoration of the painted wooden ceiling was nearing completion. The oily smoke given off by the plastic chairs was particularly damaging, coating much of the building with a sticky black layer.For a comprehensive study on the fire see Peterborough Cathedral 2001-2006: from Devastation to Restoration, Michael Bunker and Paul Binski, Paul Holberton Publishing, London 2006. . The seat of the fire was close to the organ and the combination of direct damage from the fire, and the water used to extinguish necessitated a full-scale rebuild of the instrument, putting it out of action for several years.", "*Peterborough Cathedral, 2001\u2013 2006 : from devastation to restoration, Michael Bunker and Paul Binski, Paul Holberton Publishing, London (2006), "]}, {"page": "Murder of Keith Blakelock", "response": ["Blakelock was buried in East Finchley Cemetery on 11 December 1985.
