He played guitar with Pat Fish (The Jazz Butcher) from June 1982 until 27 November 1986, when after an alcohol-fuelled altercation with Fish, he left the band.  He went on to record a solo album, The Best Kisser in the World, which mixes up-temp indie pop numbers (\"Let Somebody Down\" and \"Quiet Lives\") with songs in a moodier, jazz-influenced style.  He also played on recordings by others, including Songs from Another Season by David J.\nHe rejoined the Jazz Butcher for what was billed as the last ever Jazz Butcher gig on 21 December 1995, and has performed and recorded with Fish since, on the live album Glorious and Idiotic (2000) and the studio album Rotten Soul.  2002 saw the release of a second solo album, Hotel Figueroa, and a third, Max Eider III, appeared in 2007.\nIn 2010 Eider released his fourth solo album Disaffection on Tundraducks Records.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eider (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Max Eider (born Peter Millson), a guitarist and songwriter"]}, {"page": "Pat Fish", "response": ["Fish was born in London, England but moved early in his life to Northampton; there he attended Great Houghton Preparatory School and later Uppingham; he later read Lit.

The band included Alice Thompson, later keyboardist in The Woodentops, and later still a novelist, and Owen Jones, who was to become the Jazz Butcher's drummer for much of the 1980s.
