His first game in charge came the following Saturday with a 3\u20130 away win over Cardiff City, the final league match to be played at Ninian Park. The following week, Ipswich rounded off the season with a 2\u20131 win over Coventry City. In the 2009\u201310 season, Keane started to sign some players, some of them from his former club Sunderland. He signed goalkeeper M\u00e1rton F\u00fcl\u00f6p, midfielders Carlos Edwards and Grant Leadbitter and brought in Jack Colback, David Healy and Daryl Murphy on loan to the club. Ipswich started without a win in their first 14 matches, making them the last team to record their first win in the whole league, finally winning on 31 October against Derby County and recording their first away win of the season on 29 November against Cardiff City. Their form gradually improved throughout the season, but Ipswich drew far too many games to come anywhere near the promotion race and they finished the season in 15th place. Many inconsistencies in the 2009\u201310 and the 2010\u201311 season meant that Keane's Ipswich side never really challenged for promotions and as a result of a poor run of form, ending up with his side dropping to as low as 21st in the Championship.

However, in a 4\u20130 win over Brentford on 20 September, he was sent\u2013off \"for an over the top tackle\", leading the referee giving him a straight red card. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the first-team from suspension, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2\u20130 win over Fulham on 2 October. Whitehead captained the side for the first time in the league, in a 1\u20131 draw against Watford on 25 October. However, throughout the 2014\u201315 season, Whitehead was demoted to the substitute bench. But he did provide cover, playing twice at right\u2013back and six times in central midfield. He also captained the side once again this season against Sheffield Wednesday on 28 February, which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat. In the Championship play-offs, Whitehead was featured three times as a right\u2013back, including the play-off final at Wembley, where they lost 2\u20130 to Norwich City.
