As a prominent Victorian philanthropist, and a model to many, he promoted many causes, principally educational and theological.\nBetween 1794 and 1843, he was Treasurer of Hoxton Academy and its successor Highbury College, Middlesex. From 1825 onwards he was a founder member of Council of University College London.\nWilson was an early Director of the London Missionary Society, and in 1837 he became one of the founders of the Metropolitan Chapel Fund Association. Prior to this, he had already built at his own expense, several new Congregational chapels in London and elsewhere; the most famous being Claremont Chapel in Pentonville (1819) and Craven Chapel in Regent Street, Westminster (1822). Paddington Chapel in Westminster was another of Wilson's foundations, and here the congregation included Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Samuel Dyer.\nThomas Wilson's son and biographer, Joshua Wilson (1795\u20131874), was instrumental in proposals to form the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Letters addressed to Thomas Wilson's wife are preserved at Dr Williams's Library in London.\nA memorial to Wilson stands in Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, London, in the Yew Walk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Wilson", "response": ["Thomas Wilson, Tom Wilson or Tommy Wilson may refer to:", "*Thomas Wilson (shipping magnate) (1792\u20131869), British shipping magnate", "*Thomas Wilson, London merchant for whom Wilsons Promontory is named", "*Thomas Wilson (industrialist) (fl. 1850s to early 20th century), American business magnate", "*Thomas Wilson (Dean of Worcester) (died 1586), English Anglican priest", "*Thomas Wilson (lexicographer) (1563\u20131622), English Anglican priest, compiler of an early biblical reference work", "*Thomas Wilson (Archdeacon of Cashel) (fl. 1608\u20131616), Irish Anglican priest", "*Thomas Wilson (Dean of Lismore) (fl. 1611\u20131622), Irish Anglican priest, also Dean of Dromore", "*Thomas Wilson (Dean of Carlisle) (died 1778), English Anglican priest", "*Thomas Wilson (bishop) (1663\u20131755), English Anglican Bishop of Sodor and Man", "*Thomas Wilson (schoolmaster) (1747\u20131813), English cleric known as master of Clitheroe grammar school", "*Thomas Wilson (Archdeacon of Worcester) (1882\u20131961), English Anglican priest", "*Thomas Wilson (composer) (1927\u20132001), Scottish composer", "*Sir Thomas Wilson (record keeper) (1560?\u20131629), English official and Member of Parliament", "*Thomas Wilson (c.1767\u20131852), MP for the City of London, 1818\u20131826", "*Thomas Wilson (mayor) (1787\u20131863), mayor of Adelaide, Australia", "*Thomas Wilson (Minnesota politician) (1827\u20131910), U.S. Representative from Minnesota", "*Thomas Wilson (Pennsylvania politician) (1772\u20131824), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "*Thomas Wilson (Virginia politician) (1765\u20131826), U.S. Representative from Virginia", "*Thomas Wilson (Queensland politician) (1865\u20131933), miner and member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*Thomas Wilson (cricketer, born 1841) (1841\u20131929), English cricketer", "*Thomas Wilson (cricketer, born 1849) (1849\u20131924), English cricketer", "*Thomas Wilson (New Zealand cricketer) (1869\u20131918), New Zealand cricketer", "*Thomas Wilson (Middlesex cricketer) (fl. 1880s), English cricketer", "*Thomas Wilson (cricketer, born 1936) (born 1936), English cricketer", "*Thomas Wilson (equestrian) (born 1962), Puerto Rican Olympic equestrian", "*Thomas Wilson (academic)\u00a0(1726\u20131799), Irish academic and clergyman", "*Thomas Wilson (economist) (1916\u20132001), British economist", "*Thomas Wilson (rhetorician) (1524\u20131581), English diplomat, judge, and privy councillor", "*Thomas Wilson (philanthropist) (1764\u20131843), English Congregationalist benefactor", "*Thomas Wilson (poet) (1773\u20131858), Tyneside poet, writer of The Pitman's Pay", "*SS Thomas Wilson, American whaleback freighter wrecked in Lake Superior in 1902", "*Thomas Wilson, fictional US President in the 2012 film"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Thomas Wilson (1764\u20131843), Congregationalist benefactor of chapels and educational institutions, founder member of the UCL Council from 1825.", "Olinthus Gregory, Joseph Hume, James Mill, John Smith, Henry Warburton, John Wishaw, Thomas Wilson, and William Wilkins, architect.", "* Thomas Wilson (1764\u20131843),Named on the foundation stone, 1827, quoted in Harte, N. and North, J.
