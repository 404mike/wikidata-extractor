He was the elder son of Professor Adam Sedgwick, 1854\u20131913, and Laura Helen Elizabeth Robinson. He married Mana St David Hodson, daughter of Professor T.C.Hodson, in 1936; they had one son and one daughter.Sedgwick was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a Fellow of the college in 1919.He edited The History of Parliament volumes that covered the House of Commons during the years 1715\u20131754. His work and that of his collaborators demonstrated that the Whig and Tory parties survived Queen Anne's death in 1714 and continued to exist during the reigns of George I and George II.Eveline Cruickshanks, in her work on the Tories and the Jacobite rising of 1745, paid tribute to Sedgwick: \"My greatest debt is to the late Romney Sedgwick, a staunch Whig, whose wit and erudition I greatly admired, for a series of discussions, heated at times, but, as I well know, much enjoyed on both sides\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George III", "response": ["Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing and riding.

It may with truth be said, A boy in England born, in England bred.\" Historian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear \"to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated\".Sedgwick, pp. ix\u2013x."]}, {"page": "Walter Blackett", "response": ["* Cruikshanks, Eveline (1970) \"BLACKETT, Walter (1707\u201377), of Calverley, nr.

Peter Hasler had taken over the section dealing with 1559\u20131603 after the death of Professor J. E. Neale, and it was published in 1981. Professor S. T. Bindoff's section for 1509\u20131558 was published in 1982 shortly after his death in December 1980; Bindoff's death meant he was unable to write the usual introductory survey volume and the section appeared without it.
