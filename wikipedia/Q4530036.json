Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist. However, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that resulted from the London blitz in 1940.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. xvi.", "Barbauld commented to her husband in 1773: \"For the early part of my life I conversed little with my own Sex. In the Village where I was, there was none to converse with.\"Quoted in McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 23. Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin's memoir, what resulted was \"a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve\" in Barbauld's character.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, pp. 23\u201324. Barbauld was uncomfortable with her identity as a woman and believed she had failed to live up to the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would focus on issues central to women, and her outsider perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity being made in the 18th century.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, pp. 28\u201329.", "Barbauld's brother, John Aikin, described their father as \"the best parent, the wisest counsellor, the most affectionate friend, every thing that could command love and veneration\".Quoted in McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 30. Barbauld's father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 31. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her only sibling during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship: \"How few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have been through so long a course of years!\"McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 36.", "In May 1774, despite some \"misgivings\", Barbauld married Rochemont Barbauld (1749\u20131808), the grandson of a French Huguenot and a former pupil at Warrington.

The \"history of Sandford and Merton\" follows the reformation of Tommy Merton who is transformed from a spoiled six-year-old boy into a virtuous gentleman (Day defines virtue as the appreciation of the value of labour). Tommy, having been pampered and indulged by his mother and their slaves in the West Indies, is a proud and ignorant aristocrat; he lacks the sterling qualities of \"plain, honest\" Henry (Harry) Sandford, the yeoman farmer's son, who becomes his model and mentor in the book. Both are guided by a mentor, Mr. Barlow. Day wanted to emphasize the series of stories he had collected, which ranged from moral tales to scientific lessons to fables, but the book became famous for the story of Tommy and Harry. Many abridgements which appeared after Day's death reflect this interest; they condense the book, remove sections on educational philosophy and highlight the relationship between the two boys.Introductory essay on Sandford and Merton .
