Much of his artistic output has been generated with the use of contributed artefacts and materials. He states that through this process \"contributor, artist and viewer come closer together\". His art is influenced by the development of consumerism, technology, identity and cyberculture in society, with a distinctive focus on obsolete media.\nDrawing on recycled and obsolete technological materials as the grounds for his paintings, London-based artist Nick Gentry creates a conversation between digital and analog processes. Gentry constructs his painting supports out of materials such as film negatives, VHS cassettes, X-rays, and floppy disks. \"These objects are no longer in the spotlight,\" the artist has said of floppy disks, \"but by placing them there for a second it becomes easier to comprehend the speed and extent of the changes that are taking place today.\" Gentry often incorporates elements of these materials into his figures. The magnetic circles of floppy disks, for example, often serve as  eyes in his portraits. He tries to avoid identifying age, gender and race and said his portraits are 'like a void to be filled' which enable people to bring their own identities to his work.Such artistic works of social commentary have been featured in galleries in the UK, USA and in cities throughout the world. His work has been exhibited alongside established contemporary Young British Artists Mark Quinn, Damien Hirst, and Tracey Emin and also with notable street artists, such as Banksy, Shepard Fairey and Blek le Rat. As a result, he has been linked with both the Contemporary art and Urban art scenes in London.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walthamstow", "response": ["* Nick Gentry, portrait artist, lives and works in Walthamstow "]}, {"page": "Nick", "response": ["*Nick Gentry (born 1980), British artist"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Nick Gentry (born 1980)"]}, {"page": "Opera Gallery", "response": ["Opera Gallery represents Ellen Von Unwerth,Opera Gallery London 2018 Exhibition in VogueOpera Gallery London 2018 Exhibition on the Times Manolo Vald\u00e9s, Andr\u00e9 Brasilier, Nick Gentry, Lita Cabellut, Pablo Atchugarry, Marcello Lo Giudice, Andy Denzler, Joe Black, David Kim Whittaker, Seo Young-Deok, David Mach, and Umberto Mariani."]}, {"page": "Urban art", "response": ["*Nick Gentry "]}, {"page": "Collage", "response": ["*Nick Gentry"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampstead", "response": ["*Nick Gentry (English portrait artist)"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"G\"", "response": ["*Nick Gentry (born 1980), English artist"]}, {"page": "Tusk Trust", "response": ["Each rhino was specially designed, decorated and embellished by internationally renowned artists including Glen Baxter, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Eileen Cooper, Adam Dant, Nancy Fouts, Nick Gentry, Zhang Huan, Patrick Hughes, David Mach, Harland Miller, Marc Quinn, Axel Scheffler, Gavin Turk, Dave White, Ronnie Wood, David Yarrow and Jonathan Yeo."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Central Saint Martins", "response": ["* Nick Gentry (artist)"]}, {"page": "List of people from St Albans", "response": ["* Nick Gentry (b. 1980), portrait artist, attended school in St Albans "]}]}}
