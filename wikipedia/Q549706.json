He formed the group Humpy Bong with former Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen. The remaining members accepted Bulsara as lead singer, and recruited Taylor's friend Mike Grose as bassist. The four played their first gig at a fundraising event in Truro on 27 June 1970. Bulsara suggested the group should be renamed to \"Queen\". The others were uncertain at first, but he said, \"it's wonderful, dear, people will love it\". At the same time, he decided to change his surname to Mercury, inspired by the line \"Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me\" in the song \"My Fairy King\". The group played their first London gig on 18 July. The early set consisted of material that would later appear on the first two albums, along with various rock and roll covers, such as Cliff Richard and the Shadows' \"Please Don't Tease\". They attracted the attention of producer John Anthony, who was interested in the group's sound but thought they had the wrong bass player. Grose decided not to continue with the band and was replaced by Barry Mitchell. In turn, Mitchell left in January 1971 and was replaced by Doug Bogie for two gigs.", "In February 1971, John Deacon joined Queen. In addition to being a good bassist, his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics. On 2 July, Queen played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London. May called Terry Yeadon, an engineer at Pye Studios where Smile had recorded, to see if he knew anywhere where Queen could go. Yeadon had since moved to De Lane Lea Studios' new premises in Wembley, and they needed a group to test out the equipment and recording rooms. He tried asking The Kinks but couldn't get hold of them. Therefore, he told Queen they could record some demos in exchange for the studio's acoustic tests. They recorded five of their own songs, \"Liar\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", \"Great King Rat\", \"The Night Comes Down\" and \"Jesus\". During the recording, John Anthony visited the band with Roy Thomas Baker. The latter thought \"Keep Yourself Alive\" would be a hit and started trying to interest record companies."]}, {"page": "Genesis (band)", "response": ["In late 1969, Genesis retreated to a cottage owned by Macphail's parents, in Wotton, Surrey, to write, rehearse, and develop their stage performance. They took their work seriously, playing together for as much as eleven hours a day. Their first live gig as Genesis followed in September 1969 at a teenager's birthday. It was the start of a series of live shows in small venues across the UK, which included a radio performance broadcast on the BBC's Night Ride show, on 22 February 1970, and a spot at the Atomic Sunrise Festival held at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm a month later. During this time the band met with various record labels regarding contract offers. Initial discussions with Chris Blackwell of Island and Chris Wright of Chrysalis were unsuccessful. In March 1970, during the band's six-week Tuesday night residency at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, members of Rare Bird, whom Genesis had previously supported live, recommended the band to producer and A&R man John Anthony of Charisma Records. Anthony attended one of their shows and enjoyed them enough to convince his boss, label owner Tony Stratton-Smith, to watch their next appearance. Stratton-Smith recalled, \"Their potential was immediately apparent ... the material was good and their performance was good ... It was a long shot, because they needed time to find their strength ... but I was prepared to make that commitment\".

Mayhew \u2013 the oldest and most experienced musician \u2013 came from a different background to the rest of the band. Phillips recalled that, despite their efforts to make him feel comfortable, the drummer was unsure of his playing. In early 1970, they secured a six-week residency at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in Soho, London, during which they were spotted by Charisma Records producer John Anthony. He persuaded label boss Tony Stratton-Smith to sign them. The group wanted to branch out from their earlier pop-oriented style, and write and perform songs that were unlike any other band at the time. Rutherford later said that gigging was \"tough, but a good way of getting the music into shape\". Two songs that made it to the next album, \"Looking for Someone\" and \"Stagnation\", were recorded for a BBC session in February 1970.", "After several months of gigs, Genesis had enough material written. In June, they retreated to Trident Studios in London to record a new album. John Anthony joined them as their producer and engineer, and the songs were recorded on 16-track tape. Phillips remembered that recording was only \"slightly more sophisticated\" than on From Genesis to Revelation, and thought Anthony disliked having someone \"drop in\" individual parts. He remembered a session in which Rutherford had to listen to several minutes of the track before putting down a guitar part; by which time he had become too nervous and played it incorrectly. The group had enough material to record two albums, but felt some songs were not strong enough. They selected the strongest material for Trespass. Recording took up most of the month, trying various ideas and rearranging songs, to the extent that Charisma thought they had taken up residence in the studio.

The album was written over the summer of 1972 and combined songs that had already been performed live with new material worked out in jam sessions. Recording began in August with John Anthony, but sessions were prone to tension and disagreements. After a short Italian tour, sessions resumed with Dave Hitchcock taking over production duties. The cover was the final Genesis work to be designed by Paul Whitehead, featuring a fox wearing a red dress. Frontman Peter Gabriel wore the dress and a fox's head on stage for the following tour, which gathered press attention and greatly improved the group's profile.", "Genesis recorded Foxtrot in August and September 1972 in London at Island Studios. They were set to record with producer John Anthony, who had worked with them on their new song \"Happy the Man\" earlier in the year, but escalating costs due to the slow progress of completing it caused disagreements among Anthony and Charisma Records, the group's label, so they looked for a new producer. Banks recalled Charisma were anxious for the group to make a hit recording. The group's first choice for producer was Bob Potter, who had worked with Charisma labelmates Lindisfarne with Bob Johnston engineering. The band did not get on with Potter as he disliked their music; he compared Banks's Mellotron opening to \"Watcher of the Skies\" to the soundtrack to the science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey and felt the song was better without it. Around this time, the band put an end to these unproductive sessions and undertook an Italian tour in August 1972 before resuming work on the album the following month. The group tried out Tony Platt as a producer, but this was abandoned owing to personality clashes. Genesis then settled with co-producer Dave Hitchcock and John Burns as engineer, who would continue to work with Genesis on their next three albums. Banks felt Hitchcock was not the best replacement for the job and disagreed with him over the album's sound."]}, {"page": "Queen (Queen album)", "response": ["Queen is the self-titled debut studio album by the British rock band Queen.

Banks nicknamed Chevin \"The Weasel\" or \"The Ferret\", for his small stature and glasses that made him resemble \"a rocket scientist from the 1950s\", and for his general distaste for rock music.

Gabriel held up a makeshift cross out of a candlestick and another household item, and Jill reacted violently; (in Armando Gallo's book, I Know What I Like, Gabriel mentions that his wife had reacted badly to sleeping in a room with purple walls, purple being 'very high in the colour spectrum'). Jill was eventually calmed down and taken to bed, but neither Peter nor John Anthony slept that night.
