With all but three of the 46 League matches being played behind closed doors due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, Wycombe struggled in the early stages, failing to register a point in their first seven League outings, and failing to score in their first four. An improved run of form, which included back-to-back wins against Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham City, lifted Wycombe to 22nd in the table, but three successive defeats in December saw the club drop to bottom position on the Saturday before Christmas. The indifferent form continued into the New Year, but a fourth round FA Cup tie at home to Tottenham Hotspur proved a welcome distraction, with Wycombe taking the lead through Fred Onyedinma in the first half, before the Premier League club found their form to win the tie 4\u20131. Still bottom of the table going into the Easter period, Wycombe's fortunes then began to turn around significantly, and they still had a theoretical outside chance of survival going into the final game away at Middlesbrough. A 3\u20130 win was not enough, but results elsewhere meant that Wycombe finished the season in 22nd place with 43 points, 16 of which had been gained from the final eight games. The club was therefore relegated back to League One, but only by a margin of one point and an inferior goal difference to Derby County. After Derby County, previously accused of breaching financial fair play regulations, went into administration in September 2021, Wycombe considered legal action to recoup potential losses of up to \u00a320m."]}, {"page": "The Halley Academy", "response": ["*Fred Onyedinma \u2013 Millwall F.C. footballer"]}, {"page": "David Worrall", "response": ["On 15 June 2016, Worrall signed a two-year contract with Millwall, with the option of a further 12 months.
