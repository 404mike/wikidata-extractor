To defend the Cup, businessman Thomas W. Lawson funded for Boston designer Bowdoin B. Crowninshield a daring project: his yacht Independence was capable of unrivaled performance because of her extremely long sailing waterline, but she was largely overpowered and unbalanced and suffered from structural issues. Furthermore, Lawson's failure to commit to the NYYC's terms for defending the Cup defaulted the Independence\u02bcs elimination. Herreshoff had again received a commission from the NYYC, but had failed to secure Charlie Barr to skipper his new yacht Constitution. Instead, the Columbia\u02bcs syndicate kept Barr's crew and tried another defense. Unexpectedly, Barr led the Columbia\u02bcs crew to win the selection trials, and to successfully defend the cup again."]}, {"page": "James Guthrie (artist)", "response": ["* George Lennox Watson"]}, {"page": "J-class yacht", "response": ["|1893||Britannia||align=center|1||align=center colspan=2|K1|| George Lennox Watson||Prince Albert Edward, RYS||YRA first class rater converted to the J-Class (1931). scuttled (1936)"]}, {"page": "George Watson", "response": ["* George Lennox Watson (1851\u20131904), Scottish naval architect"]}, {"page": "Rona (1892)", "response": ["Rona was a sailing yacht designed by George Lennox Watson.
