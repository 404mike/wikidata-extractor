He was the younger brother of England international Jack Cock and his other brother Herbert was also a footballer.\nBorn in Hayle, Cornwall, Cock started his professional career with Brentford during World War I. A striker, he moved to Fulham in 1919. In three seasons with the Second Division club, he averaged a goal every other game, and was the club's leading goalscorer in 1919\u201320 and 1920\u201321. He moved to Notts County in October 1922 and played nearly 100 games in three seasons there, being the club's top scorer in 1922\u201323 and 1923\u201324, winning the Second Division title in the former.\nCock's exploits at Notts County earned the eye of Arsenal and he was signed by Leslie Knighton in March 1925, making his debut for Arsenal against Bolton Wanderers on 7 March 1925. However, in his next match, against his former club Notts County at Meadow Lane, he was tackled strongly and broke his leg. He was out of action for five months and could not find favour under new manager Herbert Chapman. Cock only played one more game for Arsenal before being sold to Clapton Orient in October 1925.\nCock regained his form at Orient, becoming top scorer for the Second Division side in 1925\u201326 and 1926\u201327 before finishing his career with brief stints at Wolves and Newport County in 1927. He retired from professional football, aged 31, soon after. He died in 1974, aged 78.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1922\u201323 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["\"The news of Leicester's loss was signalled from the veranda of the director's pavilion whilst a fierce struggle was going on around the Notts goal. Immediately there was a cheer, which swelled into a mighty roar as it was taken up by the crowd all around the ground. For the moment the players were confounded and the play seemed to hang in suspense, but immediately the loss of enthusiasm became apparent - it was a thrilling scene. An interesting touch was added when Donald Cock, the Notts County centre, found the opportunity on the field to shake hands with George Kay, the West Ham captain.\" - 'Corinthian', The Daily Graphic"]}, {"page": "Jack Cock", "response": ["John Gilbert Cock MM MID (14 November 1893 \u2013 19 April 1966) was an English footballer who played for various English club sides as a centre forward.
