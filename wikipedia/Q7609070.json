The list is by season, this being the season in which the player's name first appears in surviving sources.\nCricket underwent radical changes during the 18th century. Patronage and popular support enabled it to outgrow its roots as a village pastime and develop into a major sport. In the early 1760s, pitched delivery bowling was introduced and this necessitated the invention of the straight bat: an evolution in bowling and batting techniques that radically changed cricket.\nThe earliest known scorecards date from 1744 but it was not until 1772 that they began to be completed and are preserved on a regular basis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond", "response": ["When single wicket became the dominant form of cricket in the late 1740s, Richmond entered a number of teams mostly centred on Stephen Dingate, who was in his employ at the time. For example, a number of matches were played by a \"threes\" team of Dingate, Joseph Rudd and Pye. Richmond often found himself opposed by his former groom Thomas Waymark, still an outstanding player but now resident in Berkshire.Ashley-Cooper, At the Sign of the Wicket, p. 52."]}, {"page": "History of cricket to 1725", "response": ["One player who could have taken part in the 1709 match was William Bedle (1680\u20131768), of Dartford, who is the earliest great player whose name has been recorded. He was \"reckoned to be the most expert player in England\" and must have been in his prime c.1700 to c.1725.Buckley, 18th Century Cricket, p. 48. Other good players known to have been active in the 1720s were Edwin Stead of Kent; Edmund Chapman and Stephen Dingate of Surrey; Tim Coleman of London; and Thomas Waymark of Sussex."]}, {"page": "Richard Newland (cricketer)", "response": ["By 1747, single wicket had superseded the 11-a-side version as the most popular form of cricket, and the 1748 season was the halcyon days of single wicket. Richmond made the most of it, and his Slindon fives and threes were a regular feature of the great matches at the Artillery Ground. However, Newland did not always captain his team in 1747. There was a threes match in September in which he was again opposed by his rival Colchin, but the captaincy of his side had been given to Stephen Dingate, who was a regular fixture in Richmond's teams at this time. This could be evidence that Newland was past his best. In July 1747, he seems to be reconciled with Colchin, because not only was it the first time they played on the same side but, significantly, it was Long Robin's XI that Newland was playing for. In 1749, Newland was a member of an All-England team captained by Colchin."]}, {"page": "Val Romney", "response": ["Romney is not mentioned in 1746 sources.

On Saturday, 5 September, there was a \"threes\" game at the Artillery Ground billed as \"Long Robin's Side versus Stephen Dingate's Side\". The teams were Colchin, John Harris and Romney against Stephen Dingate, Richard Newland and Thomas Jure. It was played for sixty guineas per side and the players were especially chosen from those who had played in the two Kent v All-England games.", "In 1749, Romney made first-class appearances for All-England against Surrey at Dartford Brent and for Long Robin's XI against Stephen Dingate's XI at the Artillery Ground. In July he played for All-England in a \"fives\" match\" against Addington.Ashley-Cooper, p.53.
