Mr Absalom Flavell, of South Kirkby, had been recommended by a number of affiliated bodies for selection as prospective Labour candidate, but he voluntarily withdrew in favour of Mr Griffiths, who had a stronger backing, having been secretary and organiser of the Hemsworth Divisional Labour Party since 1917 when the constituency was created..  Griffiths held the seat at the next two general elections, and died in office in 1945.\nHe was born in North Wales and started work in a coal mine when 13 years of age and was to move to Royston in 1903 where he was employed at the Monckton Colliery to progress to checkweighman.
