Forbes (born 1795?) was an architect in Cheltenham.\nHe designed the Pittville Pump Room for Joseph Pitt (1825-1830) and St Paul's Church (1829-1831).  Besides the Pump Room, on which he personally worked 1825-28, and St Paul's Church, he is credited  with several other buildings in Cheltenham, including 129-131 Promenade, 1-13 Imperial Square, 3 houses in St James Square, Montpellier Villas, 29-37 Pittville Lawn, and Brandon House, Grafton Road. He had difficulty managing the finances of several concurrent speculative developments. In 1835 he was convicted of forgery, having attempted fraud on a business partner: a sentence of transportation was commuted to a short prison term. His architectural career did not recover.", "link_mentions": {}}}
