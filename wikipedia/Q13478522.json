Forbes (born 1795?) was an architect in Cheltenham.\nHe designed the Pittville Pump Room for Joseph Pitt (1825-1830) and St Paul's Church (1829-1831).  Besides the Pump Room, on which he personally worked 1825-28, and St Paul's Church, he is credited  with several other buildings in Cheltenham, including 129-131 Promenade, 1-13 Imperial Square, 3 houses in St James Square, Montpellier Villas, 29-37 Pittville Lawn, and Brandon House, Grafton Road. He had difficulty managing the finances of several concurrent speculative developments. In 1835 he was convicted of forgery, having attempted fraud on a business partner: a sentence of transportation was commuted to a short prison term. His architectural career did not recover.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Forbes", "response": ["John Forbes may refer to:", "*John Forbes (architect) (1795?\u2013?), British architect", "*John Forbes (poet) (1950\u20131998), Australian poet", "*John Forbes (publisher) (died 1665), Scottish music publisher; published first printed secular music in Scotland", "*John Forbes (botanist) (1799\u20131823), English botanist", "*John Forbes (physician) (1787\u20131861), Scottish physician", "*John Forbes (British Army officer) (1707\u20131759), British General in the French and Indian War", "*John Forbes (Portuguese general) (1733\u20131808), Scottish general in the Portuguese service", "*John Forbes (Royal Navy officer) (1714\u20131796), British Admiral and politician", "*John Forbes (friar) (1571\u20131606), Scottish Capuchin friar", "*John Forbes (Gaelic scholar) (1818\u20131863), Scottish minister and Gaelic translator", "*John Forbes (died 1634) (c. 1568\u20131634), Scottish minister exiled by James VI and I", "*John Forbes (theologian, born 1593) (1593\u20131648), Scottish theologian; one of the six \"Aberdeen doctors\"", "*John Forbes (died 1734) (c. 1673\u20131734), Scottish member of the British Parliament for Inverness-shire, 1715\u20131722", "*John Forbes (Iowa politician) (born 1956), Iowa State Representative", "*John Forbes (cricketer) (born 1931), South African cricketer", "*John Forbes (footballer) (1862\u20131928), Scottish footballer", "*John Forbes (sailor) (born 1970), Australian Olympian sailor", "*John Forbes and Company, the British firm of John Forbes (1767\u20131823) and his brother Thomas (\u20201808), a trading company active in the southeastern United States and India, from 1804 to 1847"]}, {"page": "1795 in architecture", "response": ["* Approximate date \u2013 John Forbes, English architect working in Cheltenham"]}, {"page": "Pittville", "response": ["Joseph Pitt, the developer of Pittville, wanted to create a  estate, with its own Pump Room, walks, rides, and gardens and up to 600 houses.
