The species had traditionally been called Hotson's mouse-like hamster because of the presumed relationship between members of the genus Calomyscus and the hamsters.  Musser and Carleton (1993) considered Calomyscus to be distinct enough from the hamsters to warrant a distinct subfamily.  Numerous molecular studies (Michaux et al., 2001; Jansa and Weksler, 2004; Steppan et al., 2004) have supported the distinctive nature of the genus, and they are currently recognized as belonging to a distinct family, Calomyscidae (Musser and Carleton, 2005)."]}, {"page": "Hotson", "response": ["* John Ernest Buttery Hotson (1877\u20131944), Governor of Bombay"]}, {"page": "The Philatelic Society of India", "response": ["*John Ernest Buttery Hotson"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Edinburgh Academy", "response": ["* John Ernest Buttery Hotson"]}, {"page": "Vinayakbuva Utturkar", "response": ["His maternal uncle was the well known freedom fighter Mr. Vasudev Balwant Gogate, also known as Hotson-Gogate for his attempted attack on the then Governor of Mumbai (Bombay), John Ernest Buttery Hotson during India's struggle for freedom from the British.
