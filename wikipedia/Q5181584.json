He then spent three seasons with Kettering Town, helping the club to win the Conference North title in 2007\u201308. He signed with Notts County in May 2009, and helped the club to win the League Two title in 2009\u201310. He was sold on to Chesterfield in August 2011, and won the Football League Trophy with the club in 2012, scoring a goal in the final. He joined Walsall, initially on loan, in November 2012. He finished as the club's top-scorer in the 2013\u201314 campaign, but was released in May 2014.

He also brought in a number of players on loan, including: Karl Darlow (21), Sam Mantom (20), Aaron McCarey (20), and Craig Westcarr (27). Mantom was made into a permanent signing in January. Smith signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract in October, keeping him at the club until summer 2015. This came after the club announced a \u00a310,000 profit on the previous campaign as Smith's 'Total Football' approach yielded a mid-table position for the young Walsall team, in addition to praise from pundits and fans.

They ended the season in ninth place, six points outside the play-offs.", "During a fine start to the 2013\u201314 season, Smith, affectionately nicknamed \"Ginger Mourinho\" by the Walsall fans, took the club to an unlikely promotion push. He masterminded a win at Molineux against Black Country derby rivals, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and also ended winning streaks by table-toppers Leyton Orient and Brentford. The club could not sustain their promotion push however, and ended the campaign in 13th place.
