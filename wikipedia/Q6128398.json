Adlington (1872 \u2013 after 1896) was an English professional footballer who played in the Football League for Small Heath. He played as an outside right.\nAdlington was born in Shifnal, Shropshire. He began his football career with Ironbridge, and joined Small Heath in August 1895. He made his debut in the First Division on 23 November 1895, deputising for Jack Hallam in a home game against Preston North End which Small Heath won 5\u20132. Adlington, a pacy player, scored in four of his next five games, but lost his place and never played for the club again. He returned to non-league football with Berwick Rangers (Worcester) and then Stourport Swifts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1895\u201396 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["The expected heavy defeat at Sunderland failed to materialise, that club's winning goal coming only when Jack Oliver\u00a0\u2013 a native of the town\u00a0\u2013 chested the ball into his own net while attempting to block a shot. The Leicester Chronicle suggested that if Small Heath could only maintain similar form, they would soon be out of trouble. An exciting though unscientific local derby against West Bromwich Albion, the closest team to Small Heath in the table, produced a 2\u20132 draw in which Fraser's courage and judgment in a defensive role was remarked upon, and Bruce and James Adlington scored their first goals for the club. On an icy surface on Boxing Day, the home forwards' enthusiasm was rewarded with a goal scored by Adlington from a Wheldon cross to beat Burnley and narrow the gap to just one point behind that club and West Bromwich Albion."]}, {"page": "Adlington (surname)", "response": ["* James Adlington (1872\u2013after 1896), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Adlington, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Adlington"]}]}}
