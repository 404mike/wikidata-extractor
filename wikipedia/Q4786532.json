He was locomotive superintendent of the Great Northern Railway from 1850 until c. 1866, having from 1840 been Daniel Gooch's assistant on the Great Western Railway.\nArchibald Sturrock is often remembered for his unsuccessful experiment with steam tenders. However, his principal achievement was the opening of the Great Northern main line and the establishment of GNR\u2019s reputation for a reliable and comfortable passenger service from London to York and beyond.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Western Railway", "response": ["A number of engineers trained at or worked for the GWR, before moving to other companies including Archibald Sturrock (GNR), Thomas Russell Crampton (SER among others), James Holden (GER), Harold Holcroft (SECR, SR), William Stanier (LMS)."]}, {"page": "Booster engine", "response": ["An early type of booster used in Great Britain was the steam tender, which was tried in 1859 by Benjamin Connor of the Caledonian Railway on four 2-4-0 locomotives.

It was used on fifty GNR 0-6-0 locomotives: thirty converted from existing locomotives between 1863 and 1866, and twenty built new in 1865 (nos. 400\u2013419).

This had  flangeless driving wheels, and was only moderately successful, having a tendency to derail. By the 1870s, improved design of bogies giving more flexibility enabled designers to create fast standard gauge express passenger locomotives of this type. On the GNR, Patrick Stirling built 53 examples with outside cylinders at Doncaster railway works between 1870 and 1895, for use on the main line between London and York. They ran at an average speed of more than 60\u00a0mph during the race to the north, and were called eight-footers because of the driving wheel, that was more than 8\u00a0ft. in diameter. Stirling's successor Henry Ivatt built a further twelve singles between 1898-1901 before moving on to larger 4-4-2 designs."]}, {"page": "0-8-0", "response": ["Two examples of 0-8-0T tank locomotives were built by Archibald Sturrock of the United Kingdom\u2019s Great Northern Railway in 1866, but the design was not perpetuated.
