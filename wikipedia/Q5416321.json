She entered the Hornsey School of Art at the age of fifteen, and in 1928 got her first job with the Amalgamated Press, drawing for Schooldays. By the time she was 21 she had drawn for virtually all of AP's girls' weekly publications. When School Friend relaunched in 1950, her strip The Silent Three, written by Horace Boyten and Stewart Pride, was the cover feature. Flinders retired in 1959. She died on 31 October 1997, at the age of 87.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cartoonists", "response": ["* Evelyn Flinders, The Silent Three"]}, {"page": "Posy Simmonds", "response": ["In May 1977 she started drawing a weekly comic strip for The Guardian, initially titled The Silent Three of St Botolph's as a tribute to the 1950s strip The Silent Three by Evelyn Flinders. It began as a silly parody of girls' adventure stories making satirical comments about contemporary life. The strip soon focused on three 1950s schoolfriends in their later, middle-class and nearly middle-aged lives: Wendy Weber, a former nurse married to polytechnic sociology lecturer George with a large brood of children; Jo Heep, married to whisky salesman Edmund with two rebellious teenagers; and Trish Wright, married to philandering advertising executive Stanhope and with a young baby. The strip, which was latterly untitled and usually known just as \"Posy\", ran until the late 1980s. It was collected into a number of books: Mrs Weber's Diary, Pick of Posy, Very Posy and Pure Posy, and one original book featuring the same characters, True Love. Her later cartoons for The Guardian and The Spectator were collected as Mustn't Grumble in 1993."]}, {"page": "1963 in comics", "response": ["* The final episode of Horace Boyten, Stewart Pride and Evelyn Flinders'  The Silent Three is published.
