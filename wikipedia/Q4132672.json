Out of these studies came his \"synchronoptic world history\" timeline, devoting the same space to all areas and times of the world simultaneously, spanning 1000\u00a0BC to 1952\u00a0AD, based on the theory that viewing all civilizations and countries concurrently shows relationships and influences that might not otherwise be obvious. Published in 1952, it presaged his world map. In these activities Peters developed a belief in the Eurocentric bias of most maps. Since he could not find a map that satisfied him, Peters developed one himself. In 1974 he announced the Peters world map, claiming it was the most accurate representation of the world. The map engendered controversy. The map projection Peters claimed to have developed had been presented more than a century earlier by the Reverend James Gall, and, despite Peters's claims, the projection was not the first or only equal-area projection. Many other of his claims were disputed or debunked. Despite criticism, over 80 million of Peters's maps have been distributed worldwide. In 1989 Peters published The Peters Atlas of the World, which at the time was the only atlas that represented all areas on about the same scale."]}, {"page": "Myrtle Bank, South Australia", "response": ["Myrtle Bank is a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia in the City of Unley.
