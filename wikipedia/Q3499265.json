The first and third books in the trilogy center on San Francisco in the near future; all three explore Gibson's recurring themes of technological, physical, and spiritual transcendence in a more grounded, matter-of-fact style than his first trilogy. Salon's Andrew Leonard notes that in the Bridge trilogy, Gibson's villains change from multinational corporations and artificial intelligences of the Sprawl trilogy to the mass media\u00a0\u2013 namely tabloid television and the cult of celebrity. Virtual Light depicts an \"end-stage capitalism, in which private enterprise and the profit motive are taken to their logical conclusion\", according to one review. This argument on the mass media as the natural evolution of capitalism is the opening line of the major Situationist work The Society of the Spectacle. Leonard's review called Idoru a \"return to form\" for Gibson, while critic Steven Poole asserted that All Tomorrow's Parties marked his development from \"science-fiction hotshot to wry sociologist of the near future.\"", "Gibson's prose has been analyzed by a number of scholars, including a dedicated 2011 book, William Gibson: A Literary Companion. Hailed by Steven Poole of The Guardian in 1999 as \"probably the most important novelist of the past two decades\" in terms of influence, Gibson first achieved critical recognition with his debut novel, Neuromancer. The novel won three major science fiction awards (the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award), an unprecedented achievement described by the Mail & Guardian as \"the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker and Pulitzer prizes in the same year\". Neuromancer gained unprecedented critical and popular attention outside science fiction, as an \"evocation of life in the late 1980s\", although The Observer noted that \"it took the New York Times 10 years\" to mention the novel.", " Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the \"conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web\". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, asking \"what if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?\""]}, {"page": "Flash Gordon", "response": ["Brian Blessed's performance as the Hawkman leader Prince Vultan lodged the veteran stage and screen actor into the collective consciousness for the utterance of a single line\u00a0\u2013 \"GORDON'S ALIVE?!\"\u00a0\u2013 which, more than 30 years later, remained the most repeated, reused, and recycled quotation from both the film and Blessed's career.\"Brian Blessed\" at the BBC's H2G2.

Though, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic gave the album 2 stars out of 5 stating that album \"After all, this is a record where Bon Jovi seems to have consciously decided to avoid everything that gives their music character, melody, and muscle, a move that would have been odd at any point during their career, but is particularly puzzling after they delivered an album that found them growing old gracefully. It's as if they want to undo everything Crush did for them\". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly rated the album with C stating that \"Bon Jovi have every right to write and sing topical songs. But the results are sonically grating (the music feels shrill and compressed) and strained, reducing the emotions and situations connected to Sept. 11 to stadium chants\". Natalie Nichols from Los Angeles Times gave the album 2 stars out of 4 stating that \"This time the music's trademark epic quality comes less from Richie Sambora's sprawling guitar work than from an overdose of strings and piano that reflects singer-actor Jon Bon Jovi's movie and TV interests\". Gavin Edwards from Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars out of 5 by saying that \"The title Bounce is meant to be an exhortation to America after 9/11, and if it doesn't exactly offer poetic catharsis, the existence of the eighth Bon Jovi record is reassurance of a different kind: Life goes on\". Sputnikmusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 saying that \"Fueled by an emotional theme, Bon Jovi end up making their best album of the millennium era\". Steven Poole from The Guardian gave the album 2 stars out of 5 saying that \"for most of the record Jon Bon Jovi sounds puzzlingly like Elvis Costello or Elton John, and sugary ballads predominate, with Bruce Hornby-like piano intros and tasteful acoustic-guitar lines leading to swollen, meaningless choruses\"."]}, {"page": "Perfect Dark", "response": ["The game's inconsistent frame rate was frequently criticised. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, the game's \"inadequate temporal resolution\u2014owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate\u2014made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels\". IGN editors observed that the frame rate can be choppy in large areas or environments with many characters on screen, but felt they were too frequently caught up in the game to notice it, or else were willing to forgive it. Poole described the \"lazy sci-fi fetishism\" of Joanna Dark's character design as \"a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft\", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye\u00a0007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond."]}, {"page": "Enter the Matrix", "response": ["Steven Poole, in his column in Edge, described the PS2 version of Enter the Matrix as \"Max Payne with celebrity scriptwriters\", and said that the films' fluid fight choreography could not be matched by the game's control system, and that the game's centred view, while practical, was not as interesting as the \"kinetic montage\" of camera angles used in the movies' action scenes.

In literature, Robert Ludlum's novel The Bourne Supremacy uses the walled city as one of its settings. The City appears as a virtual reality environment (described by Steven Poole as an \"oasis of political and creative freedom\") in William Gibson's Bridge trilogy, and as a contrast with Singapore in his Wired article \"Disneyland with the Death Penalty\". In the manga Crying Freeman, the titular character's wife travels to the walled city to master her swordsmanship and control a cursed sword. The manga Blood+: Kowloon Nights uses the walled city as the setting for a series of murders. The walled city finds an extensive mention in Doctor Robin Cook's 1991 novel Vital Signs. The filth, squalor and the crime-oriented nature of the area is described vividly when the characters Marissa and Tristan Williams pass by the back-lanes. The later part of episode 3 and episode 4 of the anime Street Fighter II V are set in the Kowloon Walled City, depicted as a dark and lawless area where Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li have to fight for their lives at every turn, being rescued by the police once they reach the walled city's limits."]}, {"page": "Joanna Dark", "response": ["Entertainment Weekly elected Joanna Dark the 14th coolest videogame character, adding \"[w]hen James Bond goes to sleep, he dreams of being Joanna Dark.\" In 2013, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly listed her as one of \"15 Kick-Ass Women in Videogames\", asserting that \"Joanna was a standout heroine in a genre that trends, even now, toward hyper-masculinity.\" Despite this, Joanna was also criticized by Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, who described her character design as \"a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft\", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters. In 2018, GamesRadar+ editors stated that Joanna was one of their most wanted characters for the crossover fighting video game series Super Smash Bros.

[H]owever, the fact that MGS2 still seems so avant-garde today might well prompt a worry: does it represent the pinnacle of a now-vanished era, the age of the experimental mainstream? This was, after all, a big-budget commercial boxed product that gleefully took risks and subverted genre conventions at every turn. Modern blockbuster games play it painfully safe by comparison.\" Gamasutra notes that the game deals with issues concerning the Information Age, and has compared the game's themes to the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The existential themes of the game align with the political philosophy and theses of Isaiah Berlin and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, focusing on the struggle between freedom and equality, and Berlin's concept of the \"pursuit of the ideal\", as the player's internal conflict of ideals are one of the main driving forces of the plot."]}, {"page": "Sprawl trilogy", "response": ["The trilogy was commercially and critically successful. Journalist Steven Poole wrote in The Guardian that \"Neuromancer and the two novels which followed, Count Zero (1986) and the gorgeously titled Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), made up a fertile holy trinity, a sort of Chrome Koran (the name of one of Gibson's future rock bands) of ideas inviting endless reworkings.\""]}, {"page": "Iron Council", "response": ["Steven Poole reviewed the book for The Guardian and suggested that \"in comparison with The Scar, such ideas are fewer and less indulgently elaborated. Iron Council feels more po-faced, more weighed down by its tonnage of political baggage ... Still, fantasy fiction is usually fabulously conservative, and Iron Council \u2013 with its implicit trade unionism, as well as the fact that many characters are casually bisexual \u2013 stands as a rebuke to the genre's medieval politics.\" Concluding \"It was a good ride.\" The Washington Post review by Michael Dirda states that \"[i]n myriad ways, China Mi\u00e9ville's New Crobuzon is an unweeded garden of unearthly delights, and Iron Council a work of both passionate conviction and the highest artistry.\""]}, {"page": "Steven Rose", "response": ["Rose was for several years a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4's ethics debating series The Moral Maze.
