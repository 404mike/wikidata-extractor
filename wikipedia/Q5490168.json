Preston (June 14, 1896 \u2013 March 1, 1989) was an English-American engineer, ecologist, and conservationist. He helped found the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and worked to reclaim the land that is now Moraine State Park in Butler County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. Preston was a leading expert in glass technology. He studied birds throughout his life and published papers on the shapes and pigmentation of birds eggs, the distribution of the heights of their nests and their migration patterns. Preston also wrote three major papers on the mathematical characteristics of ecological rarity and commonness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania", "response": ["* Preston Park, was the private estate of scientist Dr. Frank W. Preston, a prominent local figure. Upon the death of his wife Jane in 2008, the property was left to the township. The heavily forested park consists of over  with various walking trails. The park includes a large pond, the Preston's house and laboratory, an arboretum of several dozen coniferous tree species, a prairie, and the largest examples of several coniferous tree species in Pennsylvania. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places. "]}, {"page": "Jay Last", "response": ["A voracious reader, he tended to complete his schoolwork well in advance of the rest of the class.  He was encouraged by his chemistry teacher, Lucille Critchlow, who recommended him to work with Frank W. Preston, a local industrial chemist whose laboratory studied glass and glass fracture. Last began working at Preston's lab as a high-school student and continued to work for him as a university student, whenever he had a break."]}, {"page": "Reconciliation ecology", "response": ["The species-area relationship has often been applied to conservation, often quantitatively. The simplest and most commonly used formula was first published by Frank W. Preston. The number of species present in a given area increases in relationship to that area with the relationship S = cAz  where S is the number of species, A is the area, and c and z are constants which vary with the system under study. This equation has frequently been used for designing reserve size and placement (see SLOSS debate). The most common version of the equation used in reserve design is the formula for inter-island diversity, which has a z-value between 0.25-0.55, meaning protecting 5% of the available habitat will preserve 40% of the species present. However, inter-provincial species area relationships have z-values closer to 1, meaning protecting 5% of habitat will only protect 5% of species diversity."]}, {"page": "Christen C. Raunki\u00e6r", "response": ["When plotting the number of species in a plant community that fell in each 20-percentile frequency class from very frequent, i.e. numerically dominant, to very infrequent, Raunki\u00e6r discovered that most species were either very common or very rare. This came to be known as \"Raunki\u00e6r's law\" and is related to R. A. Fisher's logseries distribution and to Frank W. Preston's lognormal distribution of the number of individuals of each species in a community. The significance of his idea was, however, disputed already by some of his contemporaries."]}, {"page": "Species\u2013area relationship", "response": ["Authors have classified the species-area relationship according to the type of habitats being sampled and the census design used. Frank W. Preston, an early investigator of the theory of the species-area relationship, divided it into two types: samples (a census of a contiguous habitat that grows in the census area, also called \"mainland\" species-area relationships), and isolates (a census of discontiguous habitats, such as islands, also called \"island\" species-area relationships). Michael Rosenzweig also notes that species-area relationships for very large areas\u2014those collecting different biogeographic provinces or continents\u2014behave differently from species-area relationships from islands or smaller contiguous areas. It has been presumed that \"island\"-like species-area relationships have higher slopes (in log\u2013log space) than \"mainland\" relationships, but a 2006 metaanalysis of almost 700 species-area relationships found the former had lower slopes than the latter.Drakare S, Lennon J.L., Hillebrand H., 2006 The imprint of the geographical, evolutionary and ecological context on species\u2013area relationships Ecology Letters 9 (2), 215\u2013227"]}, {"page": "Moraine State Park", "response": ["The rebirth of the land in and surrounding Moraine State Park can be tied to the efforts of Frank W. Preston who moved to nearby Meridian in 1926. He had emigrated from England to establish a glass research lab. In addition to his work with glass, Preston was also a geologist and naturalist. On a trip to the Muddy Creek Valley he noticed that, despite the barren landscape that had been left by the oil wells and strip mines, the valley had a rich natural history of moraines. Preston worked to form the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, which purchased the land that became Moraine State Park, recreated the glacial landscape and preserved open spaces. Muddy Creek was dammed to form Lake Arthur."]}, {"page": "C.B. Williams", "response": ["With Fisher, Williams was able to establish patterns in the diversity and numbers of insects caught in light traps. He noticed that logarithmic patterns were widespread, an idea which was later developed by other ecologists like Frank W. Preston. Williams used this pattern to predict the number of head lice on people using data on counts of lice from prisoners in a South Indian jail. Williams calculated that the number of persons with only one louse must be 107 and the actual was 106 and he wrote so Nature was only one wrong."]}, {"page": "Relative species abundance", "response": ["Using several data sets (including breeding bird surveys from New York and Pennsylvania and moth collections from Maine, Alberta and Saskatchewan) Frank W. Preston (1948) argued that species abundances (when binned logarithmically in a Preston plot) follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution, partly as a result of the central limit theorem (Figure 4). This means that the abundance distribution is lognormal. According to his argument, the right-skew observed in species abundance frequency histograms (including those described by Fisher et al. (1943)) was, in fact, a sampling artifact. Given that species toward the left side of the x-axis are increasingly rare, they may be missed in a random species sample. As the sample size increases however, the likelihood of collecting rare species in a way that accurately represents their abundance also increases, and more of the normal distribution becomes visible. The point at which rare species cease to be sampled has been termed Preston's veil line. As the sample size increases Preston's veil is pushed farther to the left and more of the normal curve becomes visible(Figure 6).  Williams' moth data, originally used by Fisher to develop the logseries distribution, became increasingly lognormal as more years of sampling were completed."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Preston", "response": ["*Frank W.
