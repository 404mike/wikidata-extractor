In an essay published in College English in 2001, Martine Dutheil states that The Coral Island can be thought of as epitomising a move away from \"the confidence and optimism of the early Victorian proponents of British imperialism\" toward \"self-consciousness and anxiety about colonial domination\". She locates this anxiety in what she calls the \"rhetoric of excess\" that features in the descriptions of cannibalism, and especially in the accounts of Fijian savagery provided by Bloody Bill (most notably that of the sacrifice of children to the eel gods) and the missionary, a representative of the London Missionary Society, an \"emblematic figure of colonial fiction\". Others have also linked popular boys' fiction of the period with imperialism; Joseph Bristow's Empire Boys (1991) claimed to see an imperialist manhood,' which shaped British attitudes towards empire and masculinity.\" The novel's portrayal of Pacific culture and the effects of colonisation are analyzed in studies such as Brian Street's The Savage in Literature: Representations of 'Primitive' Society in English Fiction (1975) and Rod Edmond's Representing the South Pacific: Colonial Discourse from Cook to Gauguin (1998). The domination imposed by \"geographical mapping of a territory and policing of its native inhabitants\" is an important theme in the novel both specifically and in general, in the topography of the island as mapped by the boys and the South Pacific's \"eventual subjugation and conversion to Christianity\", a topic continued in Stevenson's Treasure Island."]}, {"page": "Eric Gregory Award", "response": ["*1982: Steve Ellis, Jeremy Reed, Alison Brackenbury, Neil Astley, Chris O'Neill, Joseph Bristow, John Gibbens, James Lasdun"]}, {"page": "Joseph Bristow", "response": ["Joseph Bristow may refer to:", "* Joseph Bristow (literary scholar), professor of English literature at UCLA"]}, {"page": "1982 in poetry", "response": ["* Eric Gregory Award: Steve Ellis, Jeremy Reed, Alison Brackenbury, Neil Astley, Chris O'Neill, Joseph Bristow, John Gibbens, James Lasdun"]}, {"page": "Professor Joseph Bristow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Bristow (literary scholar)"]}, {"page": "Charles Osborne (music writer)", "response": ["In 2011, The King's Head Theatre, London, staged a successful world premiere of an Oscar Wilde play, Constance.
