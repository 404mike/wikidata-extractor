The three houses became the property of the National Trust for Scotland, which proposed to lease No. 6 to a new trust which would administer the house as an official residence for the Secretary of State for Scotland, as a building where he could reside when in Edinburgh and where distinguished visitors could be received and entertained. The Bute House Trust was formed in 1966 to bring this idea to fruition. The Trustees raised the \u00a340,000 required for the alteration and redecoration of the house and its furnishings. The interior decoration and colour schemes were the responsibility of Lady Victoria Wemyss and Colin McWilliam. Because funding was tight, the interior refurbishment of Bute House was dependent on a number of loans.Bute House Guidebook, p. 4", "Colin McWilliam designed a desk and a bookcase incorporating copies of the portrait medallion of Robert Adam by James Tassie, for this room. The modern reproduction Georgian ladder back chairs were intended to complement the existing suite of dining chairs at Bute House.

Gifford (1990) p.1 However, since the early 20th century, architectural critics have taken a more measured view, Colin McWilliam, for instance, finding the quality of his work \"varied to an extreme degree\". As well as being an architect, Adam was involved in several industrial ventures and improvement schemes, including coal mining, salt panning, stone quarries and mills. In 1731 he began to build up his own estate in Kinross-shire, which he named Blair Adam. He was the father of three architects; John, Robert and James, the last two were the developers of the \"Adam style\".", "William Adam's dominant position in Scottish architecture is reinforced by his lack of contemporaries. Colin McWilliam, in The Buildings of Scotland: Lothian, wondered \"whether Scottish architecture at this period... would have achieved very much without him.\"", "John Fleming and Colin McWilliam are in agreement that Adam was at his best as a collaborator. Fleming's comment that Adam \"was at his best when guided by a man of taste who knew his own mind\",Fleming, p.72 is echoed by McWilliam, who suggests that William Adam \"always did his best, but did his best architecture... when he was in touch not only with his source books, but with other lively minds\"."]}, {"page": "Candia McWilliam", "response": ["Candia Frances Juliet McWilliam (born 1 July 1955) is a Scottish author.

In 1778 the Hays sold the building to Sir Archibald Hope, 9th Baronet Hope of Craighall, who made further alterations, and added a stable block in 1800 by John Paterson.

Opposition to demolition of the Georgian Square was led by the Cockburn Association, and the Georgian Group of Edinburgh, which was established by Colin McWilliam and others to resist the proposals. In the end, the western side of the square was retained. This was helped by the refusal of the Dominican Order who owned 23 and 24 George Square to sell their premises to the university, despite the offer to build a replacement church and priory. Fr Anthony Ross O.P. was instrumental in this refusal. On the northern side, the 19th century George Watson's Ladies College was retained alongside the modern Hugh Robson Building.

Following her degree in 1951, she began this work in three different part-time jobs, serving as a researcher at the Scots Ancestry Research Society, an architectural investigator for the Department of Health, and a research assistant at the Scottish National Building Record (SNBR) at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. In this last position she reported to Haswell Miller, the gallery\u2019s director. That year, historian Colin McWilliam became director of SNBR and together he and Cruft began working to record Scotland\u2019s country houses, many of which had been damaged during the war and were set to be demolished. This effort continued until economic crisis caused both to be laid off later in the 1950s. Cruft again took part-time roles, working for Lerne Grant at the Scottish Records Office as well as for architectural historian Ian Lindsay. She spent two years cataloguing Edinburgh buildings of special interest with Lindsay before Cruft took over as curator of SNBR in 1958. In this capacity she developed integrated approach to Monuments Record with architect Colin McWilliam, collecting a wide variety of materials\u2014buildings, photographs, original architectural drawings, survey drawings and biographical material\u2014together in one location."]}, {"page": "Stewart Kaye", "response": ["When he returned to work after the war, despite his son joining the firm, his style was well out of date.
