In 2003, Clark had \"broken his silence\", stating \"Mutiny is such a loaded term ... Rebellion would be a more apt description.  On the face of it, I have no regrets whatsoever. However, I now lament my own personal maturity level. In hindsight my callowness had the effect of exacerbating a complicated but manageable situation.\"  On the twentieth anniversary of the race, Topolski insisted \"It was just a selection dispute, an argument which every club in every sport has from time to time.  The media just took the story and hyped it up.\""]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's coxless four", "response": ["| Salih HassanJohn GarrettGavin StewartRichard Stanhope"]}]}}
