The RedEye articles have been cited as one of \"Ten unmissable examples of New Games Journalism\" by Guardian Unlimited.Curran's published books include Game Plan: Great Designs That Changed the Face of Computer Gaming (2004), The Art of Producing Games (2005), The Complete Guide to Game Development, Art & Design (2005) and Game On: The 50 Greatest Video Games of All Time (2006); the latter three were written with David McCarthy and Simon Byron.He currently presents the Resonance FM gaming radio show, One Life Left.Curran is credited with writing the script to Sega's PSP title, Crush, with British video game journalist Simon Parkin.\nIn 2004, Curran fabricated a fad called \"Toothing\", in which users of bluetooth cellphones were supposed to send suggestive anonymous solicitations to others within range. He registered a forum, filling it with posts from fictional users, and linked it to Gizmodo, a gadget blog. BBC, Reuters and Wired news desks all fell for the hoax.Curran was a speaker at the Nordic Game Conference and Career Expo in 2008.Curran recently started a blog called 'Consumer Writes' (a play on 'consumer rights'), in which he writes 'overwritten objections' - bizarre and unusual complaint letters to various companies in the hope of getting free stuff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Halo: Combat Evolved", "response": ["Halo received \"universal acclaim\", according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on reviews from 68 professional critics. Ste Curran's review for Edge praised the game as \"the most important launch game for any console, ever\" and commented, \"GoldenEye was the standard for multiplayer console combat. It has been surpassed.\" GameSpot claimed that \"Halo's single-player game is worth picking up an Xbox for alone,\" concluding, \"Not only is this easily the best of the Xbox launch games, but it's easily one of the best shooters ever, on any platform.\" IGN remarked similarly, calling Halo a \"can't miss, no-brainer, sure thing, five star, triple A game.\" Gary Whitta of Official Xbox Magazine calling Halo as \"a stunning achievement.\" AllGame editor Jonathan Licata praised Bungie for doing \"a remarkable job with Halo, taking many successful elements from previous standouts in the genre to make one very playable game\". Among the specific aspects that reviewers praised were the balance of weapons, the role of drivable vehicles, and the artificial intelligence of enemies."]}, {"page": "Toothing", "response": ["Toothing was originally a hoax claim that Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones or PDAs were being used to arrange random sexual encounters, perpetrated as a prank on the media who reported it. The hoax was created by Ste Curran, then Editor at Large at the gaming magazine Edge, and ex-journalist Simon Byron. They based it on the two concepts dogging and bluejacking that were popular at the time. The creators started a forum in March 2004 where they wrote fake news articles about toothing with other members and then sent them off to well-known Internet-based news services. The point of the hoax was to \"highlight how journalists are happy to believe something is true without necessarily checking the facts\". Dozens of news organizations, including BBC News, Wired News, and The Independent thought the toothing story was real and printed it. On April 4, 2005, Curran and Byron admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. There have, however, been real Bluetooth dating devices since.", "Devised by Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson, Bluetooth is an open wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances from mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal computers. Originally, Bluetooth was only intended for wireless exchanging of files between these devices, but it was later discovered that it could also be used for sexual intentions. The hoax concept of toothing started around March 2004 in the form of a forum designed by Ste Curran, then Editor at Large at games magazine Edge, and ex-journalist Simon Byron. Toothing was conceived as a merger of the two concepts dogging with bluejacking, both of which were frequently mentioned in the UK media around that time. Byron said he and Curran were \"idly messaging about the Stan Collymore dogging scandal, and how this stupid sexual buzzword had (apparently) come from nowhere,\" when they came up with the concept. \"We wondered if we could create our own. We wonder a lot of things, and rarely push them past concept, because we\u2019re as collectively creative as we are frustratingly idle. This particularly concept was simple enough to outstrip the temptations of grinning, saying 'Yeah!', and wandering off to see what was on [television].\" Several newspapers have also compared toothing to dogging."]}, {"page": "Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars", "response": ["In his book Game Plan: Great Designs that Changed the Face of Computer Gaming, British video game journalist Ste Curran wrote that Broken Sword influenced the adventure games Toonstruck, in which Cecil has a \"Special Thanks\" credit, and Escape from Monkey Island, which features a puzzle that involves a broken sword. Kevin Bruner, co-founder of Telltale Games, has said that he is a Broken Sword fan. Ashton Raze, a writer for The Telegraph and the co-creator of the 2013 adventure game Richard & Alice, said that Broken Sword is his biggest influence.
