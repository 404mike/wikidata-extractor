However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before the First World War. The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western, but that in practice, \"successful and influential\" war films are about modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing. The film scholar Kathryn KaneKane, 1982. points out some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame World War II as a conflict between \"good\" and \"evil\" as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous peoples.Kane, Kathryn. \"The World War II Combat Film\". In: Wes D. Gehring (ed.) Handbook of American Film Genres. New York: Greenwood Press, 1988, pp. 90-91, . James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and \"war-movie escapades\" like The Dirty Dozen.", "Further, Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition-by-example of \"the World War II combat film\", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of \"hastily assembled volunteers\" hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their \"bravery and tenacity\". She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films that are only just war films. However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to include films that deal \"with the roles of civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)\" Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which \"determines the fate of the principal characters\". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films. Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick's Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about that war which he considers \"notable\". The screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all feature-length narrative films can be classified as belonging to one of them."]}, {"page": "James Clarke", "response": ["James Clarke may refer to:", "*James Clarke (composer) (born 1957), British composer", "*James Clarke (author) (born 1972), cinema author", "*James Clarke (Iowa politician) (1812\u20131850), American politician and Governor of Iowa Territory", "*James Clarke (died 1599), English MP for Leicester", "*James Clarke (died 1612), English MP for Mitchell", "*James Clarke (died 1621), English MP for Taunton", "*James Clarke (athlete) (1874\u20131929), Irish Olympic tug of war competitor", "*James Clarke (footballer, born 1913), English footballer for Bradford City and Rotherham United", "*James Clarke (footballer, born 1923), English footballer for Nottingham Forest", "*James Clarke (footballer, born 1982), English footballer for Rochdale and Grimsby Town", "*James Clarke (footballer, born 1989), English footballer for Newport County", "*James Clarke (footballer, born 2000), Irish footballer for Mansfield Town F.C.", "*James Clarke (cricketer) (born 1979), English cricketer", "*James Clarke (rower) (born 1984), British lightweight rower", "*James Clarke (antiquary) (1798\u20131861), English antiquary and amateur poet", "*James Clarke (VC) (1894\u20131947), English World War I soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*James Clarke Hook (1819\u20131907), English painter"]}, {"page": "Faeries (book)", "response": ["Faeries features watercolours and pencil drawings. Comparing the two authors' illustrative styles, writer James Clarke remarked that Lee's images \"skew slightly more towards a sense of realism\" while Froud's style \"is slightly more heightened and his fairy faces are immediately identifiable.\" Writing for Library Journal, M. L. del Mastro described the illustrations as a mix of \"Maxfield Parrish delicates with Disney/Hildebrandt grotesques.\" The Washington Post identified the book's \"stylistic debts\" as being to Arthur Rackham, Richard Dadd, Willy Pogany, and the pre-Raphaelite painters John William Waterhouse, John Everett Millais and Edward Burne-Jones. The Atlantic Monthly also likened the illustrative style to the painters Arnold B\u00f6cklin and Hieronymus Bosch. Fantasy literature scholar Dimitra Fimi wrote that Lee's illustration for the entry \"Faerie Rades\", depicting the procession of the Irish fairies as \"splendidly dressed men and women in medieval style, most of them riding decorated horses and one of them holding an unfolding banner,\" took a strong influence from John Duncan's 1911 painting The Riders of the Sidhe."]}]}}
