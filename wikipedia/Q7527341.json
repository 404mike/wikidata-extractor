He fought at Cape Henry with Arbuthnot and at St. Kitts with Hood, eventually being promoted to command a number of small ships on the American coast. Despite his rise through the ranks, he clashed occasionally with the naval hierarchy, with the first incident occurring while still a newly commissioned commander aboard HMS Shrewsbury. An incident over unqualified lieutenants led to his court-martial, though he was acquitted. A more serious incident occurred after the end of the war with America, when Coffin was particularly active off the Canadian coast. A charge was brought of issuing false musters, and though the practice was endemic in the navy, led to his dismissal from the ship. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Howe, then intervened to have him dismissed from the navy entirely, a decision that was later overturned by an inquiry, which set an important precedent.  Restored to his rank, Coffin commanded several ships during the opening years of the wars with France, but the recurrence of an old injury forced him to move ashore. He spent the rest of the war commanding a number of dockyards, continuing to rise through the ranks, and being created a baronet for his good service. Retiring from active naval service towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars Coffin briefly changed his surname to Coffin-Greenly before reverting it, entered politics, and died with the rank of admiral in 1839.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roger Hale Sheaffe", "response": ["Shaeffe was educated at the Boston Latin School with his cousin Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet. His father died penniless in 1771 and his mother opened a boarding house to support her 10 children. One of the residents there was Lord Percy, later the 2nd Duke of Northumberland, the leader of the British forces in Boston during the American War of Independence. Lord Percy greatly aided the family during the War and was so struck by the qualities and the leadership potential of Shaeffe that he sent him to a military academy in London. Lord Percy became Shaeffe's lifelong friend and benefactor, purchasing his first commission as Ensign in 1778 in the 5th Regiment of Foot. He later purchased a lieutenancy."]}, {"page": "William Behnes", "response": ["*Bust of Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet, Athenaeum, Boston, USA (1826)"]}, {"page": "Coffin (surname)", "response": ["* Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet, Royal Navy officer"]}, {"page": "Coffin baronets", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Coffin Baronets", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet"]}]}}
