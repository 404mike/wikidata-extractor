Jean-Pierre Abel-R\u00e9musat, who taught himself Chinese, filled the position, becoming the first professor of Chinese in Europe. By then the first Russian Sinologist, Nikita Bichurin, had been living in Beijing for ten years. Abel-R\u00e9musat's counterparts in England and Germany were Samuel Kidd (1797\u20131843) and Wilhelm Schott (1807\u20131889) respectively, though the first important secular sinologists in these two countries were James Legge and Hans Georg Conon von der Gabelentz. In 1878, a Professorship of Far Eastern Languages, the first of its kind in the German-speaking world, was created at the University of Leipzig with von der Gabelentz taking the position. Scholars like Legge often relied on the work of ethnic Chinese scholars such as Wang Tao."]}, {"page": "List of Protestant missionaries in China", "response": ["| Samuel Kidd"]}]}}
