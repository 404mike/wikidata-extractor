Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in Istanbul within 14 days. A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition. When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed the main attack would be launched on or around 17 March.

On 26 June 1897, she was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Captain John Ferris was appointed in command in January 1899, and from February the following year she joined the Eastern division of the Channel Fleet, flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Arthur Dalrymple Fanshawe. On receiving word of the death of Queen Victoria on 21 January 1901 while stationed in Portsmouth, Magnificent flew the Royal Standard at half mast. Captain Arthur John Horsley was appointed in command in October 1900, and in June the following year she became flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir William Acland, second in command of the Channel Squadron. He relinquished the position one year later, and at sunset on 5 June 1902 struck his flag on board the Magnificent.

After slow progress, the bombardment of the Turkish defences was called off due to low ammunition stocks and fears of a newly laid Turkish minefield. Writing to his wife, Keyes expressed frustration at the lack of imagination of his new superior, Vice-Admiral John de Robeck, arguing that \"We must have a clear channel through the minefield for the ships to close to decisive range to hammer the forts and then land men to destroy the guns.\"Carlyon, p. 82 Keyes took charge in an operation in March 1915 when six trawlers and the cruiser  attempted to clear the Kephez minefield. The operation was a failure, as the Turkish mobile artillery pieces bombarded Keyes' minesweeping squadron. Heavy damage was inflicted on four of the six trawlers, while HMS Amethyst was badly hit and had her steering gear damaged. After another abortive attempt to clear the mines a few days later, the naval attempt to force the straits was abandoned and instead troops were landed to assault the guns.Carlyon, p. 83\u201384 For his service during the Dardanelles Campaign, Keyes was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1916 and awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 3 June 1916."]}, {"page": "French battleship Suffren", "response": ["When the Marine Nationale mobilized in anticipation of war on 1 August, the Division de compl\u00e9ment was ordered to Algiers, French Algeria, to protect the convoy route to Metropolitan France. They conducted their first escort mission on 6 August before arriving at Bizerte, French Tunisia, on the 22nd where they began conducting contraband patrols in the Sicilian Narrows. In September Suffren was fitted with additional Barr and Stroud rangefinders near the bridge. Two of these were mounted on transverse rails fore and aft of the bridge. The after bulkhead was removed and the two 100-millimetre guns on the side of the superstructure were moved one deck lower. Gu\u00e9pratte complained that his ships were not well suited to such a mission and he was ordered to take Suffren, the predreadnought  and the torpedo cruiser  to Port Said, Egypt, to escort troop convoys from British India on 23 September. The following day he was ordered to rendezvous with the semi-dreadnought  at the island of Tenedos where he was to place himself under the orders of the British Vice-Admiral Sackville Carden to assist British ships in blockading the Dardanelles to prevent any sortie by the Ottoman battlecruiser  and the light cruiser  back into the Mediterranean. The Division de compl\u00e9ment was renamed the Division des Dardanelles (Dardanelles Division) to reflect its new role. On 3 November the two French battleships joined British ships bombarding the Ottoman fortifications at the mouth of the Dardanelles. The short bombardment by the Allies, during which Suffren fired 30 shells from her main guns, did little damage, but alerted the Ottomans that their defences there required strengthening. After the predreadnought  arrived on 16 November Suffren sailed for Toulon for a lengthy refit.Caresse, p. 20; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 229, 252\u2013253, 260"]}, {"page": "HMS Implacable (1899)", "response": ["In March 1915, as the British and French fleets waging the Dardanelles campaign were preparing to launch a major attack on 18 March, the overall commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, requested two more battleships of the 5th Squadron, Implacable and Queen, to be transferred to his command in the expectation of losses in the coming operation.

Carden received instructions to force the straits and then push on to Constantinople: he made an unsuccessful attempt to do this on 19 February 1915, but then fell seriously ill, leaving de Robeck to take command, with his flag in the battleship , in March 1915. De Robeck's campaign to force the straits, launched on 18 March 1915, nearly succeeded, as the Turkish land-based artillery almost ran out of ammunition: however, mines laid in the straits led to the loss of three Allied battleships.Heathcote, p. 67 De Robeck, seeing no sense in losing more ships, then abandoned the whole naval operation. On 25 April 1915 the Royal Navy landed General Ian Hamilton's troops at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula (Cape Helles) and at Anzac Cove, on the peninsula's western coast. The Ottoman forces and their German advisors had had two months warning from the first serious navy attack to prepare ground defences before the follow-up ground landing could be mounted, and they used the time effectively.Carlyon, pp. 79\u201383 The initial landings failed to achieve their objectives, and the Allies made a further unsuccessful attempt, in August 1915, at Suvla Bay. In the wake of this setback, Commodore Roger Keyes, de Robeck's Chief of Staff, argued for a third attempt to force the straits, but de Robeck recommended against it and the Admiralty accepted de Robeck's advice. The ground campaign, like the naval campaign, ultimately proved a failure, and although de Robeck was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his service in the Gallipoli Campaign on 1 January 1916, he had to organize the evacuation of Hamilton's troops off the Gallipoli peninsula on the night of 8 January 1916."]}, {"page": "HMS Cornwallis (1901)", "response": ["In January 1915, Cornwallis was ordered to the Dardanelles to participate in the Dardanelles campaign against the Ottoman Empire. She departed Portland on 24 January 1915 and arrived at Tenedos to join the British Dardanelles Squadron under Admiral Sackville Carden on 13 February 1915. Cornwallis was one of six British and French battleships selected to lead the first attack on the straits on 19 February, under the operational control of Vice Admiral John de Robeck. The operational plan called for Cornwallis to suppress the Ottoman \"Orkanie\" coastal battery. At 09:51 on 19 February, Cornwallis fired the first shots of the Dardanelles campaign when she began her bombardment of the \"Orkanie\" battery, but her time on station was cut short when a defective capstan prevented her from dropping anchor. The Ottomans had not returned fire, so de Roebeck ordered his ships to anchor in place to improve their accuracy. Cornwallis was therefore replaced by the battleship Vengeance; she instead was tasked with acting as a spotter for the battleship  and the battlecruiser . Later in the day, around 15:00, Cornwallis and Vengeance joined the French battleship  as it attacked the fortress at Kumkale at close range; at the same time, she used her 6-inch guns to attack the \"Helles\" battery. About an hour and a half later, the Ottoman coastal guns finally began to engage the Anglo-French fleet, and Cornwallis came under fire but was unscathed.
