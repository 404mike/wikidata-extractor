In the 1898 season, he played for   Lancashire Second XI and returned to the Derbyshire team during the 1899 season. He played one match in the County Championship before Derbyshire played host to the touring Australian cricket team. Despite Wilmot finishing not out from seventh in the batting lineup, Derbyshire lost by an innings margin, thanks to centuries from the Australians' batsmen Hugh Trumble, Monty Noble and Joe Darling, all of whom were past and future Test cricketers for the national side. There was a two-year gap before his next County Championship appearance in the 1901 season when he played one first-class game in July against London County.Wilmot was a wicket-keeper and took eleven catches and one stumping in ten first-class matches. He was a right-handed batsman and played 16 innings with an average of 11.92 and a top score of 25 not out.\nWilmot died in Wade Hill.", "link_mentions": {}}}
