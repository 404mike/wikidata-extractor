In the 1898 season, he played for   Lancashire Second XI and returned to the Derbyshire team during the 1899 season. He played one match in the County Championship before Derbyshire played host to the touring Australian cricket team. Despite Wilmot finishing not out from seventh in the batting lineup, Derbyshire lost by an innings margin, thanks to centuries from the Australians' batsmen Hugh Trumble, Monty Noble and Joe Darling, all of whom were past and future Test cricketers for the national side. There was a two-year gap before his next County Championship appearance in the 1901 season when he played one first-class game in July against London County.Wilmot was a wicket-keeper and took eleven catches and one stumping in ten first-class matches. He was a right-handed batsman and played 16 innings with an average of 11.92 and a top score of 25 not out.\nWilmot died in Wade Hill.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wilmot (surname)", "response": ["*William Wilmot (1869\u20131957), English cricketer "]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1897", "response": ["Of those who made their debuts in the season, Arnold Warren went on to play for the club for 23 years and represented England in 1905, and Maynard Ashcroft, a doctor, went on to become club captain. Most of the remaining newcomers were from mining families. Frank Davidson, Joseph Hancock and William Wilmot each played over several more seasons but more or less occasionally. James Cross, Herbert Bostock, Dick Steeples and Edward Houseman all appeared only in the 1897 season, Cross playing nine matches, Bostock four, Steeples three and Houseman one. Cross and Steeples filled in for the lack of bowling, while Bostock achieved a high average in his three games."]}, {"page": "Wilmot, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Wilmot"]}]}}
