In response, he was informed that Platte had ceased trading in the UK with effect from 25 February 2009.  No specific reason was given for this withdrawal, but it is fair to assume that the continued resistance by British consumers to what they regarded as an unfair business model must have played a part in its decision, along with the threat of action by HM Revenue concerning possible non-payment of VAT.  In an email to Michael Pollitt, the company said it had stopped operating in the UK, and that \"Our reasons for this decision and our further intentions are simply related to our original marketing and business model\", adding: \"Obviously, and just like any other business should and would do, I am making sure that stopping our marketing to the UK Market, is done in such a sensible and orderly manner, that will best preserve the interests of our customers and of our own.\""]}, {"page": "National League of Young Liberals", "response": ["Some of those associated with the Green Guard, including Martin Horwood and Adrian Sanders, have gone on to become MPs, and others, including Edward Lucas, Felix Dodds and Stephen Grey, have become journalists and authors on international issues.
