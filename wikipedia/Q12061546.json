The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and they bought the site in February 2004 after six months of negotiations. The deal came after York were lent \u00a32\u00a0million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), with which they bought 75.89% of BCH shares and all of the 20,000 shares owned by Persimmon.

They won none of their final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division.
