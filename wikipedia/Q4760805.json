He began his career in non-league football and did not turn professional until he joined Watford at the age of 26. In 1996, Hessenthaler joined Gillingham and spent the next ten years at the club as player and later player-manager, managing the club to its highest ever finish in the English football league system and becoming regarded as a legend of the Kent club. After leaving Gillingham, he had a short spell at Barnet, before joining Dover Athletic in 2007. In his two seasons in charge he led the club to successive championships, of Isthmian League Division One South and the Isthmian League Premier Division. After three years at Dover, he became manager at Gillingham for the second time, but his contract was terminated at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. He returned to the club as assistant manager in 2014, before taking on a similar role at Leyton Orient the following year. In 2016, he was appointed manager of the club, but was sacked later the same year. In November he was appointed manager of Eastleigh, but the following year left to return to Dover.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gillingham F.C.", "response": ["Taylor then left to manage Leicester City, and Andy Hessenthaler was appointed as player-manager.  He led the club to their best ever league finish of eleventh in the 2002\u201303 season, but the following season saw the club narrowly avoid relegation on goal difference. Hessenthaler resigned as manager in November 2004, and new boss Stan Ternent was unable to prevent the Gills' relegation to League One. At the end of the 2007\u201308 season the club was relegated again, this time to League Two,  but an immediate return to the third level was secured via the play-offs after beating Shrewsbury Town in the final.  In the 2009\u201310 season, however, the Gills slipped into the bottom four on the last day, and were relegated back to League Two, having failed to win a single away game in the league all season.  This resulted in manager Mark Stimson having his contract terminated, and Andy Hessenthaler was appointed as manager of the club for the second time.  At the start of the 2012\u201313 season Hessenthaler was replaced by Martin Allen, who led the club to promotion as League Two champions in his first season in charge. However, shortly after winning League Two, Allen was sacked in what many saw as a surprise after a poor start to the season.

A specialist subsequently confirmed that this injury would sideline him for approximately six weeks. By the time of his return the Gills were embroiled in a battle to avoid relegation and their fortunes took a turn for the worse when Fuller suffered a broken nose mere seconds after kick-off after a clash of heads with teammate Darren Dennehy in what would go on to be a 3\u20132 win over Leeds United on 17 April 2010; he was substituted by Jack Payne in the fourth minute of play. Fuller was unable to prevent the Gills' relegation slide back into League Two after he was sidelined for the rest of the season, undergoing surgery on his broken nose a few days after the incident. In spite of this, however, he was offered a two-year contract extension, along with teammate Garry Richards, by new Gills manager Andy Hessenthaler on 25 March 2010.
