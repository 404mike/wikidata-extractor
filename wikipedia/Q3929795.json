He played as both an attacking midfielder or a winger.\nHe began his career at Dundee United, helping the club to be crowned Premier Division champions in 1982\u201383, and playing in Scottish Cup and League Cup final defeats. In recognition of his contribution to the most successful period in the club's history, Milne has been inducted into the Dundee United Hall of Fame, alongside several of his former teammates. He made a total of 285 appearances for Dundee United in major competitions and is the club's all-time top scorer in Europe (UEFA Cup and European Cup) with a tally of 15 goals. Milne is often considered to be among the best Scottish footballers not to win a full senior cap.\nHampered by his heavy drinking, he hit his peak at an early age and after an unsuccessful spell at English club Charlton Athletic from January 1987, ended the 1987\u201388 season with Third Division club Bristol City. He returned to the First Division after being signed by Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in November 1988 for a \u00a3170,000 fee, but failed to restart his career. Barring a brief spell in Hong Kong with Sing Tao, Milne played his last first-team game as a professional at the age of 28.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 6", "response": ["*2015 \u2013 Ralph Milne, Scottish footballer (b. 1961)"]}, {"page": "Dundee United F.C.", "response": ["*  Ralph Milne"]}, {"page": "Paul Sturrock", "response": ["In 1982\u201383, Dundee United won the Scottish League Championship, losing only four League games during the season. Sturrock contributed to this success with eight goals in his 28 appearances. He also set up Ralph Milne for his fourth-minute opener against Dundee in the final League game. The Scottish Cup that year had been yet another early exit at the hands of St Mirren. Sturrock scored seven in the nine games he turned out in on the way to a League Cup quarter-final exit. He also played in seven of the eight games and scored once in a UEFA Cup run that ended with an exit in Prague."]}, {"page": "Ryan Giggs", "response": ["At this time, United had recently won the FA Cup \u2013 their first major trophy since the appointment of Alex Ferguson as manager in November 1986. After two seasons in the league where they had finished mid-table, they were finally starting to threaten the dominance of Liverpool and Arsenal, though they only managed to finish sixth that season. Ferguson's quest for a successful left-winger had not been an easy one since the departure of Jesper Olsen two years earlier; he had initially signed Ralph Milne, but the player was not a success at United and lasted just one season in the first team before Ferguson secured the Southampton winger Danny Wallace in September 1989. Wallace had failed to shine at Old Trafford, and by the time Giggs turned professional Wallace was contending with 19-year-old Lee Sharpe for the role of first-choice left winger."]}, {"page": "John Barnes", "response": ["At the end of the 1986\u201387 season, Taylor called time on his 10-year spell as Watford manager to take charge at Aston Villa. Bassett, resigned to losing Barnes to a bigger club, gave Alex Ferguson the chance to sign Barnes for Manchester United. Ferguson rejected the offer still having faith in United's left winger Jesper Olsen. Ferguson later admitted that he regretted not signing Barnes, especially as Barnes helped extend Liverpool's dominance in England by three seasons, while Olsen fell out of favour at Old Trafford and had left by the end of 1988, with his successors Ralph Milne and Danny Wallace failing to live up to expectations. Ferguson's United waited until 1990 to win a major trophy and 1993 to win the league title."]}, {"page": "Danny Wallace (footballer)", "response": ["The left wing had been one of Ferguson's areas where improvement was needed. After the departure of Jesper Olsen in November 1988, he had drafted in Scotsman Ralph Milne, but the player was hugely disappointing and Ferguson quickly decided that he needed a more talented player to fill this position. 18-year-old Lee Sharpe had started the season as United's first choice left winger, but Ferguson wanted a more experienced player for this position and seemed to have found what he was looking for in Wallace."]}, {"page": "Jim McLean", "response": ["McLean was first team coach at Dundee for 18 months. In November 1971 the club's manager John Prentice announced that he would resign at the end of that year; many outside observers assumed that McLean would become their manager. Instead he became manager of their local rivals Dundee United, where he replaced the retiring Jerry Kerr. McLean immediately started a co-ordinated youth policy which was to produce many fine young players over the two decades which followed; he had personally visited Ralph Milne, John Holt, and Davie Dodds to encourage them to sign for United rather than for Celtic, Aston Villa, and rivals Dundee respectively. In the short term, he used his knowledge of the Scottish scene to buy experienced players who would allow him to re-shape both the squad and the style of play in line with his approach to coaching."]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Ralph Milne"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 European Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Ralph Milne"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 in English football", "response": ["11 November 1988 \u2013 Ralph Milne, the 27-year-old winger with Bristol City in the Third Division, makes a surprise \u00a3170,000 move to Manchester United."]}, {"page": "Eamonn Bannon", "response": ["Season 1982\u201383 saw Dundee United involved in a tight contest with Celtic and Aberdeen for the Scottish Premier Division title.  Bannon proved to be an important player for United, scoring ten league goals. As the season neared its end, Dundee United faced Celtic at Parkhead on 20 April 1983. United took the lead in the first half when Celtic defender Roy Aitken mis-headered a Bannon corner, allowing Paul Hegarty to score. Celtic equalised before half-time but Bannon converted a penalty kick early in the second half to restore United's lead. Celtic again equalised, but on 84 minutes Bannon's cross from the right was volleyed in by Ralph Milne to clinch a 3\u20132 win. Dundee United went into their final league fixture of the season, against Dundee at Dens Park, still needing a win to guarantee the title.  Bannon had a penalty kick saved in the first half but scored from the rebound to put United 2\u20130 ahead, and despite Dundee pulling a goal back, United held on to win their first ever Scottish league title."]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 UEFA Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Ralph Milne"]}]}}
