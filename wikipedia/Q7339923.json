He was a founding member and original bassist for The Wonder Stuff, based in Stourbridge (West Midlands, England).\nJones was born in Kingswinford, near Dudley, West Midlands in 1964. He joined Miles Hunt, Malcolm Treece, and Martin Gilks to form the Wonder Stuff in March 1986 and recorded the singles \"A Wonderful Day\" and \"Red Berry Joy Town\".\nJones played on the debut album The Eight Legged Groove Machine and the follow-up Hup. Following disagreements within the group, he left in December 1989, and went to America as soon as the group had played the final night of a sellout 3 night residence at Birmingham's Aston Villa Leisure Centre.\nHe married Michelle Robinson, Sid Vicious' last girlfriend, who had changed her name to Jessica Ronson in the late 1980s. [1]\nAfter the move to New York he formed another band, The Bridge & Tunnel Crew, singing vocals and playing rhythm guitar, with Jessica sharing the song writing.[2]\nHe died in New York on 31 July 1993, aged 29. The cause of his death is variously recorded as due to heart problems, heart attack, potentially caused by heroin, or drug-related causes. He left behind his mother Mary, brother Trevor, and second wife, Jessica Ronson-Jones. [3] His body was cremated and ashes were scattered at a number of locations - close to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, near the Parachute Drop at Coney Island and in a flowerbed by the swimming pool at Tammy Wynette's house.[4]\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hup (album)", "response": ["*Rob \"The Bass Thing\" Jones - bass"]}, {"page": "Construction for the Modern Idiot", "response": ["The album was dedicated to the memory of Rob \"The Bass Thing\" Jones, the band's original bassist who died from a heart attack in New York soon after leaving the band.
