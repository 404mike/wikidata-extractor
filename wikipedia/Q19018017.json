Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16\u201319-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students."]}, {"page": "Hoare", "response": ["* Desmond Hoare (Royal Navy officer) (1910\u20131988), British sailor and educator"]}, {"page": "Desmond Hoare (admiral)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Desmond Hoare (Royal Navy officer)"]}]}}
