He met two admirers, Charles Lane and Henry C. Wright. The two men were leaders of Alcott House, an experimental school based on Alcott's methods from the Temple School located about ten miles outside  London. The school's founder, James Pierpont Greaves, had only recently died but Alcott was invited to stay there for a week. Alcott persuaded them to come to the United States with him; Lane and his son moved into the Alcott house and helped with family chores. Persuaded in part by Lane's abolitionist views, Alcott took a stand against the John Tyler administration's plan to annex Texas as a slave territory and refused to pay his poll tax. Abby May wrote in her journal on January 17, 1843, \"A day of some excitement, as Mr. Alcott refused to pay his town tax\u00a0... After waiting some time to be committed [to jail], he was told it was paid by a friend. Thus we were spared the affliction of his absence and the triumph of suffering for his principles.\" The annual poll tax was only $1.50. The incident inspired Henry David Thoreau, whose similar protest led to a night in jail and his essay \"Civil Disobedience\". Around this time, the Alcott family set up a sort of domestic post office to curb potential domestic tension. Abby May described her idea: \"I thought it would afford a daily opportunity for the children, indeed all of us, to interchange thought and sentiment\".", "thumb|right|Alcott and Charles Lane founded \"Fruitlands\" in 1843."]}, {"page": "Ralph Waldo Emerson", "response": ["Bronson Alcott announced his plans in November 1842 to find \"a farm of a hundred acres in excellent condition with good buildings, a good orchard and grounds\".Baker, p. 218. Charles Lane purchased a  farm in Harvard, Massachusetts, in May 1843 for what would become Fruitlands, a community based on Utopian ideals inspired in part by transcendentalism.Packer, p. 148. The farm would run based on a communal effort, using no animals for labor; its participants would eat no meat and use no wool or leather.Richardson, p. 381. Emerson said he felt \"sad at heart\" for not engaging in the experiment himself.Baker, p. 219. Even so, he did not feel Fruitlands would be a success. \"Their whole doctrine is spiritual\", he wrote, \"but they always end with saying, Give us much land and money\".Packer, p. 150. Even Alcott admitted he was not prepared for the difficulty in operating Fruitlands. \"None of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed. So we fell apart\", he wrote.Baker, p. 221. After its failure, Emerson helped buy a farm for Alcott's family in Concord which Alcott named \"Hillside\"."]}, {"page": "Harvard, Massachusetts", "response": ["Amos Bronson Alcott relocated his family, including his ten-year-old daughter, Louisa May Alcott, to Harvard in June 1843. He and Charles Lane attempted to establish a utopian transcendentalist socialist farm called Fruitlands on the slopes of Prospect Hill in Harvard. The experimental community only lasted 7 months, closing in January 1844. Fruitlands, so called \"because the inhabitants hoped to live off the fruits of the land, purchasing nothing from the outside world\",Fruitlands Museum  saw visits from the likes of Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson.Patricia Harris, Anna Mundow, David Lyon, James Marshall, Lisa Oppenheimer.

He was friendly with Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau. Between January and June 1843, a series of nine letters he penned were published in such abolitionist's papers as The Liberator and The Herald of Freedom. The title under which they were published was \"A Voluntary Political Government\" in which Lane described the state in terms of institutionalized violence and referred to its \"club law, its mere brigand right of a strong arm, [supported] by guns and bayonets\". He saw the coercive state on par with \"forced\" Christianity, arguing: \"Everyone can see that the church is wrong when it comes to men with the [B]ible in one hand, and the sword in the other. Is it not equally diabolical for the state to do so?\" Lane believed that governmental rule was only tolerated by public opinion because the fact was not yet recognized that all the true purposes of the state could be carried out on the voluntary principle, just as churches could be sustained voluntarily. Reliance on the voluntary principle could only come about through \"kind, orderly, and moral means\" that were consistent with the totally voluntary society he was advocating, adding: \"Let us have a voluntary State as well as a voluntary Church, and we may possibly then have some claim to the appeallation of free men\"."]}, {"page": "Brook Farm", "response": ["The community was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model based on the socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing The Harbinger as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, the community was financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands. Nathaniel Hawthorne was a founding member of Brook Farm, though he was not a strong adherent of the community's ideals. He later fictionalized his experience in his novel The Blithedale Romance (1852).", "Ralph Waldo Emerson never joined the Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his \"conviction that the Community is not good for me\". He also questioned the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, \"The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day ... and both received at night the same wages\". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, one of the founders of another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were \"playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner\".Delano, 119 Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community.Rose, 189 After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment.Crowe, 179 Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, \"As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven\". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as \"childish, empty, & sad\".Rose, 196"]}]}}
