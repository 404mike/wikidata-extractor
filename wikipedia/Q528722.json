Viscount Charles de la Lande de Calan proposed, in 1908, that Ho\u00ebl was an illegitimate son for whom Conan III decided to provide Nantes for his support.  The name Ho\u00ebl had been used for illegitimate sons of the counts of Nantes.  Katharine Keats-Rohan, in 1996, proposed that Conan III disinherited his legitimate son for the purpose of unifying Brittany through the marriage of his daughter Bertha to her cousin Alan, whose father inherited two of the provinces of Brittany. Ho\u00ebl was given Nantes for his lifetime.  This arrangement would have required years of planning to implement, and might have begun before Ho\u00ebl was born.Everard, Judith Ann.

Walter (senior) was known to, and described as a blood relative of, Remigius de F\u00e9camp, Bishop of Lincoln who contributed substantially to William I's conquest of England. It has been speculated that D'Aincourt's rewards were due not to his contribution to the conquest but to his kinship of Remigius. However, J.R. Planch\u00e9 believed, on the basis of Walter's son William D'Aincourt being so described on a plaque found in his tomb, that Walter's wife Matilda was of royal descent. On this basis, plus proof that Walter and Matilda made donations on Alan Rufus's behalf, and chronological considerations, Matilda is arguedNottingham Medieval Studies 36: 42\u201378.
