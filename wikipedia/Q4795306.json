He is Professor Emeritus at King's College London. Between 1975 and 1996 he was Professor at King's. Previously he lectured at Cambridge, Nottingham (1964\u20131969) and Cardiff (1969\u20131975), where one of his students was Australian composer Norma Tyer.\nSince the 1960s he has published books, articles and contributed chapters to multi-authored books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harmony", "response": ["Current dictionary definitions, while attempting to give concise descriptions, often highlight the ambiguity of the term in modern use. Ambiguities tend to arise from either aesthetic considerations (for example the view that only pleasing concords may be harmonious) or from the point of view of musical texture (distinguishing between harmonic (simultaneously sounding pitches) and \"contrapuntal\" (successively sounding tones). In the words of Arnold Whittall:"]}, {"page": "Das Rheingold", "response": ["Although it is sometimes performed independently, Das Rheingold is not generally considered outside the structure of the Ring cycle. However, as Millington points out, it is a substantial work in its own right, and has several characteristics not shared by the other works in the tetralogy. It is comparatively short, with continuous music; no interludes or breaks. The action moves forward relatively swiftly, unencumbered, as Arnold Whittall observes, by the \"retarding explanations\" \u2013 pauses in the action to clarify the context of what is going on \u2013 that permeate the later, much longer works. Its  lack of the conventional operatic devices (arias, choruses, ensembles) further enable the story to progress briskly."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Britten", "response": ["Smaller-scale works for accompanied voice include the five Canticles, composed between 1947 and 1974. They are written for a variety of voices (tenor in all five; counter-tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV) and accompaniments (piano in I to IV, horn in III and harp in V).\"Canticle I\" , \"Canticle II\" , \"Canticle III\" , \"Canticle IV\" , and \"Canticle V\" , Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 30 June 2013 The first is a setting of Francis Quarles's 17th-century poem \"A Divine Rapture\", and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell's Divine Hymns. Matthews describes it as one of the composer's most serene works, which \"ends in a mood of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten's music\". The second Canticle was written in 1952, between Billy Budd and Gloriana, on the theme of Abraham's obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac.  \"Canticle III\" from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell's wartime poem \"Still Falls the Rain\", composed just after The Turn of the Screw with which it is structurally and stylistically associated. The twelve-note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten's compositional technique. Canticle IV: The Journey of the Magi, premiered in 1971, is based on T. S. Eliot's poem \"Journey of the Magi\". It is musically close to The Burning Fiery Furnace of 1966; Matthews refers to it as a \"companion piece\" to the earlier work. The final Canticle was another Eliot setting, his juvenile poem \"Death of Saint Narcissus\". Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about, the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text \"almost frighteningly apt\u00a0... for a composer conscious of his own sickness\". Matthews sees Narcissus as \"another figure from [Britten's] magic world of dreams and ideal beauty\"."]}, {"page": "Michael Tippett", "response": ["Bowen has described Tippett as \"a composer of our time\", one who engaged with the social, political and cultural issues of his day. Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of \"ultimately optimistic humanism\".  Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works to seek \"to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, while at the same time never losing sight of the contemporary reality\".Kemp, pp. 481\u201382 The key early work in this respect is A Child of Our Time, of which Clarke writes: \"[t]he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know my shadow and my light, So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett\u00a0... this [Jungian] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works\"."]}, {"page": "T\u014dru Takemitsu", "response": ["Takemitsu frequently expressed his indebtedness to Claude Debussy, referring to the French composer as his \"great mentor\".Takemitsu, Confronting Silence, 36\u201338.

Logically this ought to be faster than the preceding music, which was Adagio then Largamente molto (broadening \u2013 that is, slowing \u2013 a lot), but most conductors slow down.

London: The Athlone Press, 1978. . describes the D to C note progression followed by the B (enharmonically equivalent to C\u266d) to C progression in the strings as being the final resolution of the tonal dissonance created by the striking A\u266d minor chord from near the beginning of the work (also for example the \"dissonant\" A\u266d resolves to \"consonant\" G in the immediately preceding section). The D to C note progression is also the first two notes of the trombone's recurring \"Aino\" theme. Arnold Whittall describes this ending as \"triumphantly abrupt\"."]}, {"page": "Colin Matthews", "response": ["Matthews was born in London in 1946; his older brother is the composer David Matthews. He read classics at the University of Nottingham, and then studied composition there with Arnold Whittall, and at the same time with Nicholas Maw. In the 1970s he taught at the University of Sussex, where he obtained a doctorate for his work on Mahler, an offshoot of his long collaboration with Deryck Cooke on the performing version of Mahler's Tenth Symphony. During this period he also worked at Aldeburgh with Benjamin Britten and Imogen Holst. His music has been published principally by Faber Music since 1976."]}, {"page": "Richard Emsley", "response": ["Emsley initially studied with Arnold Whittall at University College, Cardiff, after which he moved to London, where he still lives.

Most of the orchestral writing, says the music analyst Eric Roseberry, lies \"well within the range of intelligent young players of very restricted technique\". Several episodes of the opera \u2013 such as \"the grinding conflict of Britten's passacaglia theme against Dykes's familiar hymn-tune in the storm\" \u2013 introduces listeners and the youthful performers to what Roseberry terms \"a contemporary idiom of dissonance\", in contrast to the \"outworn style\" of most music written for the young. With its innovatory arrangement of vocal and instrumental forces, Noye's Fludde is summarised by Whittall as \"a brilliant demonstration of how to combine the relatively elementary instrumental and vocal skills of amateurs with professionals to produce a highly effective piece of music theatre.\""]}]}}
