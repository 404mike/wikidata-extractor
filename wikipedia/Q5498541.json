On his death his son, Frederick Peel, commissioned the building of the current Manor House. In 1855 William Eden Nesfield designed the Neo-Tudor Gothic building that we see today. The Peel family played an important role in the Industrial Revolution, particularly due to their part in the mechanisation of the cotton and spinning industry. Their motto, 'Industria', is carved into the oak panelling on Hampton Manor's main staircase. This celebration of industry is juxtaposed with the later Arts and Crafts additions that Frederick Peel made to the land, re-commissioning Nesfield to build a clocktower in 1872, and Thomas Hayton Mawson to design a walled garden with a Jacobean gateway in around 1900."]}]}}
