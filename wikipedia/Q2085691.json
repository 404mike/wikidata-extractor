Though J. S. Mill claims that all of his principles on liberty appeal to the ultimate authority of utilitarianism, according to Nigel Warburton, much of the essay can seem divorced from his supposed final court of appeals. Mill seems to idealize liberty and rights at the cost of utility. For instance, Mill writes:Warburton 2008, John Stuart Mill On Liberty", "Nigel Warburton states that though Mill encourages religious tolerance, because he does not speak from the perspective of a specific religion, some claim that he does not account for what certain religious beliefs would entail when governing a society. Some religions believe that they have a God given duty to enforce religious norms. For them, it seems impossible for their religious beliefs to be wrong, i.e. the beliefs are infallible. Therefore, according to Warburton, Mill's principle of total freedom of speech may not apply.Mill 1859, p. 32", "The harm principle is central to the principles in On Liberty. Nigel Warburton says that Mill appears unclear about what constitutes harm. Early in the book, he claims that simply being offensive does not constitute harm.Mill 1859, pp. 72\u201373 Later, he writes that certain acts which are permissible and harmless in private are worthy of being prohibited in public.Oliveira, Offence and Costumary Morality This seems to contradict his earlier claim that merely offensive acts do not warrant prohibition because, presumably, the only harm done by a public act which is harmless in private is that it is offensive."]}, {"page": "Sevenoaks School", "response": ["* Nigel Warburton, philosopher"]}, {"page": "The Philosophers' Football Match", "response": ["Philosophers A.
