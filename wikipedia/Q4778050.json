However he dismissed it as he did not believe it would have the potential for a 75,000 capacity stadium. Sir Anwar Pervez and his company Bestway devised an alternative stadium scheme with Liverpool City Council. It would have seen Everton move to just outside Liverpool city centre. Bestway property director Malcolm Carter said: \"We have recently been presented with an opportunity which, for the city, would combine the massive desirability of allowing Everton FC to remain within the city of Liverpool and come home to Everton, while acting as a catalyst for the regeneration of the wider area. This would involve developing a new stadium and associated commercial enterprises both within our existing location and on neighbouring sites. Bestway already has a design team in place and are in discussion with a stadium contractor about working up proposals which, from an initial assessment, are very feasible. We know that a football stadium will fit into our site and could work in this location. It would be the blue heart of the city.\""]}, {"page": "Islam in England", "response": ["Conversely, Muslim Council of Britain estimates that there are more than 10,000 British Muslim millionaires.
