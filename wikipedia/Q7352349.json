In the mid-1950s Government money became available for both an extension to the workshop for applied arts and for a new building on a site facing Kensington Gardens, adjacent to the Royal Albert Hall. The rector of the college, Robin Darwin decided to keep the design of the building \"in-house\" and asked the interior design course leader and architect, Hugh Casson for his help. Casson formed a team with two other architects, Cadbury-Brown and head of Silversmithing and Jewellery, Robert Goodden. In the team Casson had responsibility for client liaison, Goodden developed the brief and Cadbury-Brown did the design work and contract administration."]}, {"page": "Lady Darwin", "response": ["* Ginette Darwin (?-2006), 2nd wife of Sir Robin Darwin"]}, {"page": "Sir Robin Darwin", "response": ["#REDIRECTRobin Darwin"]}, {"page": "Darwin (surname)", "response": ["**Robin Darwin (1910\u20131974), artist"]}, {"page": "War Artists' Advisory Committee", "response": ["* Robin Darwin "]}, {"page": "Janey Ironside", "response": ["In 1956, at Robin Darwin's urging, Ironside was appointed as the Royal College of Art's professor of fashion, a post she was to hold until 1968.

The appointment came just as British fashion was about to enter its \"youthquake\" phase. According to Elizabeth Wilson, Ironside attributed this phenomenon to a combination of British eccentricity and the Welfare State and educational grants which allowed people with talent that would once have been wasted to go to college. Angela McRobbie described Ironside, along with Muriel Pemberton, as the key figures in enabling fashion to attain academic respectability in Britain."]}, {"page": "Madge Garland", "response": ["In 1947, Garland was invited to become the first professor of fashion at the Royal College of Art by Robin Darwin, taking up the role a year later. As her Times obituary notes, she had to effectively invent the course \u2013 creating an academic framework that would serve the industry. As most of the available art teachers didn't have the required background, Garland brought in teachers from industry, notably cutters from the fashion trade, also liaising with the Manchester textile industry to source materials and designs."]}, {"page": "Anthony Devas", "response": ["Devas was born in Bromley in Kent, the second of four children to Thomas Gronow Devas, the chairman of the Devas Routledge textile firm, and Marjorie Cecilia Watson.
