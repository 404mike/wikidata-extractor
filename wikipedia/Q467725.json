In 1923 she won the women's doubles title at the U.S. National Championships with McKane defeating the American pairing of Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman and Eleanor Goss in three sets. She was also a runner-up in the mixed doubles event at Wimbledon in 1921, partnering Max Woosnam. In 1924 she was part of the British Wightman Cup team who defeated the United States 6\u20131 at Wimbledon. Covell won both her singles matches against Helen Wills and Molla Mallory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Helen Wills", "response": ["During the winter months Wills worked on her game and according to her trainer Pop Fuller she had improved her overhead, service and footwork. In April the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) selected Wills for the Olympic team and for the Wightman Cup and the Wimbledon Championships leading up to the Olympics. On May 14 Wills departed New York on board the RMS Berengaria for her first trip to Europe. There was excitement in the press about the prospect of an encounter with Suzanne Lenglen, the French world No. 1 player and five-time Wimbledon champion. Upon her arrival in England Wills focused on practice sessions to get accustomed to the grass courts instead of playing warm-up tournaments. The Wightman Cup was played in June on the Wimbledon grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. Wills lost both her singles matches, to Phyllis Covell and Kitty McKane, but won the doubles with Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman. Wills entered her first Wimbledon Championships a few days after the conclusion of the Wightman Cup. She came through the draw with ease and reached the final without the loss of a set. Her opponent in the final McKane had received a walkover in the semifinal after Lenglen withdrew due to illness. Wills won the first set and led 4\u20131 in the second with a game point for 5\u20131 but McKane staged a comeback with attacking play and won the next two sets, and the title, against a tiring Wills. It would be Will's only loss in the Wimbledon singles event during her career. She did win the doubles event partnering Hotchkiss Wightman, her first Wimbledon title, after a win in two sets in the final against Covell and McKane.", "| bgcolor=\"gold\"|Gold ||1924 || Summer Olympics, Paris || Grass|| Hazel Wightman || Phyllis Covell Kathleen McKane||7\u20135, 8\u20136"]}, {"page": "List of US Open women's doubles champions", "response": ["| 1929 || Phoebe Holcroft Watson  Peggy Michell || Phyllis Covell   Dorothy Shepherd-Barron || 2\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20134"]}, {"page": "List of US Open mixed doubles champions", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|1929||  Betty Nuthall Shoemaker George Lott || Henry W.
