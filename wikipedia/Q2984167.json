They stated that it \"represents, both as a whole and in its details, a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session 22 of the Council of Trent\". Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, a former Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, supported this study with a letter of 25 September 1969 to Pope Paul VI. Cardinal Antonio Bacci signed the same letter. The critical study became known as \"the Ottaviani Intervention\". Cardinal Ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public, and that Pope Paul VI's doctrinal exposition, on 19 November and 26 November 1969, of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that \"no one can be genuinely scandalized any more\".Quotation from Documentation Catholique, 1970; the full text of the letter in an English translation is given in The New \"Ordo Miss\u00e6\": A battle on two fronts  Jean Madiran, a critic of Vatican IIJe suis un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 charge contre mon temps and founder-editor of the French journal Itin\u00e9raires, claimed that this letter was fraudulently presented to the elderly and already blind cardinal for his signature by his secretary, Monsignor (and future Cardinal) Gilberto Agustoni, and that Agustoni resigned shortly afterwards.
