He was the second of three sons of Major-General Lord George William Russell and Elizabeth Anne Rawdon, daughter of the Hon. John Theophilus Rawdon, himself second son of the 1st Earl of Moira. His elder brother was Francis, later 9th Duke of Bedford and his younger brother was Odo, later 1st Baron Ampthill.\nHe was educated in Germany. From 1849 to 1854 he was private Secretary to his uncle, the Liberal Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Between 1857 and 1885, he sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock. He only spoke rarely in the Commons, once in reply to an attack on his brother, Odo.\nOn 25 September 1865, Russell married Laura de Peyronnet, daughter of Paul Louis Jules, Vicomte de Peyronnet. Together they had six children, Harold Russell, Flora Russell, the diplomat Sir Claud Russell, Caroline Russell, Major Gilbert Russell and Conrad Russell.\nHe was raised to the rank of a Duke's son on 25 June 1872 and was then known as Lord Arthur Russell.\nHe was a great clubman and belonged to Brooks's, the Athenaeum, the Cosmopolitan, Grillion's, THE CLUB, and the Metaphysical Society. He was involved in the Senate of the University of London, serving on this body from 1875 until before his death.\nRussell died on 4 April 1892, at 2 Audley Square, London and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. There is a memorial to him in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael's Church, Chenies.\nThe ideological gulf between Britain and the new German Empire was stressed by Lord Russell in 1872:\n\nPrussia now represents all that is most antagonistic to the liberal and democratic ideas of the age; military despotism, the rule of the sword, contempt for sentimental talk, indifference to human suffering, imprisonment of independent opinion, transfer by force of unwilling populations to a hateful yoke, disregard of European opinion, total want of greatness and generosity, etc., etc.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Metaphysical Society", "response": ["*Lord Arthur Russell, British politician"]}, {"page": "Arthur Russell", "response": ["* Lord Arthur Russell, (1825\u20131892), British Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Alfred Gilbert", "response": ["In this period, Gilbert made statues of Donald Mackay, 11th Lord Reay, and prison reformer John Howard.

The German Empire was considered a useful counterbalance on the Continent to both France and Russia, the two powers that worried Britain the most.

The new nation would be a stabilising force, and Bismarck especially promoted his role in stabilising Europe and in preventing any major war on the continent. British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, however, was always suspicious of Germany, disliked its authoritarianism and feared that it would eventually start a war with a weaker neighbour.Karina Urbach, Bismarck's Favorite Englishman (1999) ch 5 The ideological gulf was stressed by Lord Arthur Russell in 1872:"]}, {"page": "Arthur John Edward Russell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lord Arthur Russell"]}, {"page": "Arthur Russell (politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lord Arthur Russell"]}, {"page": "Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1868 || Arthur RussellStyled Lord Arthur Russell from 1872|| Liberal"]}, {"page": "Lord Russell", "response": ["*Lord Arthur Russell (1825\u20131892), MP for Tavistock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Lord Arthur Russell"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Lord Arthur Russell"]}, {"page": "Lord Arthur John Edward Russell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lord Arthur Russell"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Lord Arthur Russell"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1857\u20131868)", "response": ["|Lord Arthur Russell"]}, {"page": "Claud Russell", "response": ["Russell was the second son of Lord Arthur Russell.
