Drawing on her own recollection and that of other Oxford classicists, she described his seminars as his most important contribution to classical teaching as the meetings were attended mainly by undergraduates with whom Fraenkel shared his broad knowledge in several areas of the Classics. Acknowledging the influence of these seminars on the intellectual development of many Oxford undergraduates, the Hellenist Martin West wrote: \"Here we saw German philology in action; we felt it reverberate through us as he patrolled the room behind our chairs... We knew, and could not doubt, that this was what Classical Scholarship was and that it was for us to learn to carry it on.\" The philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch, who had been a student at Oxford, composed a poem entitled 'The Agamemnon Class, 1939' which juxtaposed Fraenkel's seminar with the outbreak of the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Faculty of Classics, University of Oxford", "response": ["*Stephanie West"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of Hertford College, Oxford", "response": ["* Stephanie West"]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Stephanie West FBA, classical scholar"]}]}}
