He was mainly associated with Kent teams and made nine known appearances in first-class matches.\nMills was born at Benenden in Kent into a family of cricketers. He made his first-class debut in 1825 against a Sussex XI at Brighton, playing alongside his brother Richard. He made eight appearances for Kent sides between then and 1829. Mills' final first-class appearance was for the Players in the Gentlemen v Players of 1831. It is reported that the invitation to play in the match was meant to be made to Richard, but that, due to the method of addressing professionals simply by their surname, was misunderstood.Mills died at Rolvenden in Kent in 1865 aged 72.", "link_mentions": {}}}
