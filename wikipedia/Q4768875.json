Warner  (25 August 1940 \u2013 16 May 2012) was a British biologist and a professor in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at University College London. Her major field of research was morphogenesis. Warner was known for her work and leadership in a variety of research projects and organisations. She is perhaps most well known for her roles as a cell electrophysiologist, politician of science, and founder of the organisation UCL centre CoMPLEX.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pate's Grammar School", "response": ["* Anne Warner, professor of developmental biology at UCL, and director from 1999-2006 of UCL's Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology"]}, {"page": "National Institute for Medical Research", "response": ["* Anne Warner FRS, biologist"]}, {"page": "Sammy Lee (scientist)", "response": ["Lee first published research in Neuroscience during the 1980s (from the Biophysics department at UCL), having worked on nerve muscle interaction ranging from examining TTX-resistant action potentials in denervated muscle  to studying cholinesterase activity in dissociated adult muscle fibres  following up on the work first done in the same department by Bill Betz and Bert Sakmann. Lee changed his focus to embryos, when he realised that many of the questions framed by his Neuroscience research were rooted in the matter of differentiation. The ultimate undifferentiated cell is the fertilised egg. This led Lee to work on gap junctions in early mammalian embryos (in the Anatomy & Embryology department at UCL), where work with Anne Warner FRS and Anne McLaren DBE FRS produced new information on factors affecting communication between cells and their developmental potential."]}, {"page": "Anne Warner", "response": ["Anne Warner may refer to:", "*Anne Warner (politician) (born 1945), Australian state politician", "*Anne Warner (rower) (born 1954), American rower", "*Anne Warner (scientist) (1940\u20132012), British biologist", "*Anne Warner (swimmer) (born 1945), American Olympic swimmer", "*Anne Warner (author) (1869\u20131913), American author ", "*Anne Warner (folklorist) (1905\u20131991), American folklorist and song collector"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 May \u2013 Anne Warner, biologist, cerebral haemorrhage (born 1940)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2012", "response": ["*Anne Warner, 71, British biologist, cerebral haemorrhage."]}, {"page": "Index of women scientists articles", "response": ["*Anne Warner (scientist)"]}, {"page": "Anne Elizabeth Warner", "response": ["#REDIRECTAnne Warner (scientist)"]}]}}
