He began his career in the academy at Premier League club Fulham, before joining League One club Brentford in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shrewsbury Town F.C.", "response": ["In late 2019 the club started attracting fans from the small Caribbean island nation of Grenada. The support stemmed from the club having two Grenada internationals, Aaron Pierre and Omar Beckles, who helped the nation to a six-match unbeaten run in qualifying for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.  The president of the Grenada Football Association, Cheney Joseph, adopted The Shrews as his team, stating \"I have fallen in love with Shrewsbury. I\u2019m serious. I believe they can become a dream story, a Cinderella story\". In November 2019, Joseph sent a partnership offer to the club, as well as a formal invitation for Town chairman Roland Wycherley to visit the country. On 9 November, Oliver Norburn became the third Town player to be called up by Grenada, whom he qualified for through his paternal grandfather. On 26 January 2020, Joseph made his first visit to his adopted club, where he witnessed The Shrews come back from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 with Premier League leaders and European and World champions Liverpool, setting up a replay at Anfield."]}, {"page": "Pierre", "response": ["* Aaron Pierre (born 1993), footballer"]}, {"page": "Sam Ricketts", "response": ["In the summer of 2019, Ricketts made more notable signings to strengthen the squad for the upcoming 2019\u201320 season, bringing in players such as Jason Cummings from Nottingham Forest, Sean Goss from Queens Park Rangers, Donald Love from Sunderland, Ethan Ebanks-Landell from Wolves and Aaron Pierre from Northampton Town. Ricketts started the season with a 1\u20130 win at home to Portsmouth on 4 August, with loanee Ryan Giles scoring the goal. During the 2019\u201320 season, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup for the second time during his management spell, defeating Bradford City, Mansfield Town and Bristol City along the way. The fourth round would see Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side host Premier League leaders and European and World champions Liverpool, where Shrewsbury came from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 with 2 goals from substitute Jason Cummings, forcing a replay at Anfield. In the replay, Shrewsbury fell short after a Shaun Whalley goal was disallowed by VAR for offside and an own goal from Ro-Shaun Williams saw the hosts win 1\u20130. This cup run brought repercussions, however, as Ricketts and the club went 10 league games without a win between December 2019 and February 2020. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Accrington Stanley on 11 February 2020 followed by another 2\u20130 defeat away at Portsmouth on 15 February put Ricketts' job under severe pressure. The winless run ended a week later on 22 February after a 1\u20130 win at home to Doncaster Rovers. On 14 March 2020, Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side were scheduled to take on top-of-the-table Coventry City at St Andrew's, however the match was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, the 2019\u201320 League One season was cut short and it was decided that final league positions would be based on a points-per-game basis. This saw the club finish 15th in the final table."]}, {"page": "Alan Kernaghan", "response": ["Kernaghan left Clyde to take up the role as manager of Dundee.

Kernaghan made an appearance as a player during a 2013\u201314 pre-season friendly versus FC Einheit Rudolstadt, replacing Aaron Pierre after 65 minutes.

Manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink said that \"with Regan Poole playing a lot of his football in midfield recently and with Leon Barnett recovering from injury, while Ash Taylor and Aaron Pierre have done very well, they have had to play a lot of football recently and haven't had the benefit of competition for their places. Ryan coming in provides that and, with him having been on the training ground with us for a while, we have had the chance to have a look at him and he has already fitted in well with the group.\" He was released by the \"Cobblers\" upon the expiry of his contract on 3 January 2018."]}]}}
