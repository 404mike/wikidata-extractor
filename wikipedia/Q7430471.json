The character returned 14 years later in a highly publicized week in September 2003, where Sharon discovered that Den had survived his shooting and had fled to Spain afterwards. The development of Den's return to the show was contributed with the introductions of his and Michelle's daughter Vicki (Scarlett Alice Johnson), as well as Den's biological son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), and later the character's manipulative second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) in 2004. His second stint on the programme saw Den repeatedly clash with Dennis over his romantic feelings for Sharon \u2013 which sparked a longstanding father-son feud that escalated after Den discovered that Dennis had killed his mob boss Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), and subsequently destroyed his relationship with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), by getting her to lie to Dennis that she was pregnant with their baby. Additionally, Den established a rivalry with Sharon's ex-boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) that ended with him framing the latter for armed robbery; formed a friendship with Dot Branning (June Brown); slept with Phil's ex-wife Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and his sister Sam (Kim Medcalf) as revenge; became publicly humiliated after losing a high-stakes poker game to the square's crime kingpin Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs); and conned Sam into relinquishing her ownership of The Queen Vic back to him by blackmailing her lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett)."]}, {"page": "Dennis Rickman", "response": ["During his time on the show, Dennis established an intense feud with his alpha-male rival and the square's undisputed top-dog kingpin Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) - also Sharon's on-off boyfriend.

Grantham had turned down every offer to return until that which was made to him in early 2003, feeling that his character did not have adequate links to the show for a comeback to be anything more than an attempt to boost ratings \u2013 particularly when Den's daughter Sharon was away from 1995 to 2001, leaving Den without any family in the cast. By 2003, however, his daughter Vicki, played by Scarlett Alice Johnson, had rejoined the cast and a previously unknown son called Dennis Rickman, played by Nigel Harman, was also in the series \u2013 the product of an affair between Den and a young woman called Paula Rickman, 30 years earlier."]}, {"page": "Sharon Watts", "response": ["In early 2003, Den's daughter Vicki (now Scarlett Alice Johnson) returns to Walford.

The character was described by Oberman as being like Angie \"but with 15 more years of feminism behind her\", and was hailed by the TV editor of the Evening Standard as \"the only strong woman left in Walford\". She became well known for her deviousness and \"scheming\", echoing the traits of her husband, with the official EastEnders website characterising her as \"happy to play mind games\" and \"often two steps ahead\" of Den. As part of the Watts family and the last of its major members to have appeared on the show, Chrissie's storylines explored her tumultuous marriage to Den; bonding with his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) and her two half-siblings, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Alice Johnson); conspiring with Den to retake ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; forming a relationship with her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) after Den's murder; attempting to sell the Queen Vic Jake's gangland boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt); being blackmailed by young wayward Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner); and feuding with the rival Mitchell family. During her time on the show, Chrissie sparked numerous clashes with other female characters - such as her archenemy Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf); Stacey's cousin Kat (Jessie Wallace); Phil's girlfriend Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny); Kat's daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan); and Sam's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor). It was noted by Oberman herself that Chrissie \"had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives\", and was constantly scheming against those who got in her way - thereby earning her the sobriquet of \"super-bitch\".", "Chrissie Watts first arrived in Albert Square \u2014 the community of Walford, a fictionalized borough in East London \u2014 in search of her estranged husband, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). When they cross paths, it becomes clear that their marriage has grown sour ever since Den sold their bar in Spain and taken the money without her consent. Den manages to persuade her to give their marriage another try, and to stay in Walford with him. Chrissie reluctantly agrees and is surprised to learn that he has an adopted daughter, Sharon (Letitia Dean), along with two other children: Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Alice Johnson). Later on, Chrissie learns that the reason Den was in Spain with her was because he was in exile after faking his own death back in 1989; Dennis' gangland boss Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), whom he recently killed nearly a year ago, tried unsuccessfully to have Den murdered for setting up his illegal activities on Dalton's criminal organization known \"The Firm\". In 1997, just around eight years after surviving The Firm's attempt to kill him, Den met Chrissie and the two would later get engaged and subsequently married."]}, {"page": "Vicki Fowler", "response": ["Vicki Fowler is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Emma Herry from the character's birth in 1986 to 1988, Samantha Leigh Martin from 1988 to 1995, and Scarlett Alice Johnson from 2003 to 2004. She is the daughter of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). The character is born in the serial, conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a whodunnit angle, at the time of the first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Early suspects were Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), but then four possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts. As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a car pulls up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leap out of a car to give it all away: Den Watts is the father of Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.", "In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge decided to reintroduce the character 8 years after she had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, the second stage of the audition process was an interview with EastEnders' Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue in front of a camera and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Alice Johnson was cast: \"At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing\u2014I'd been guessing for ages!\" Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: \"I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!\" The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house."]}, {"page": "List of former EastEnders characters", "response": ["| Scarlett Alice Johnson ||rowspan=\"3\"| 1986\u20131995, 2003\u20132004"]}, {"page": "Spencer Moon", "response": ["Spencer tries to settle down and works for his brother as a barman to keep out of trouble.
