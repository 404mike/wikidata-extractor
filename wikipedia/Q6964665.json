A Wizard of Earthsea received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection Fantasy for Children, British critic Naomi Lewis described it in the following terms: \"[It is not] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves in one of the most important works of fantasy of our time.\" Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that \"Le Guin has\u00a0... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy\", while a review in The Guardian by author and journalist Amanda Craig said it was \"The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [written] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail.\""]}, {"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Naomi Lewis (1911\u20132009) \u2013 English translations of the works of Hans Christian Andersen"]}, {"page": "Holborn", "response": ["* Naomi Lewis (1911\u20132009), advocate of animal rights, poet, children's author and teacher, lived in Red Lion Square 1935\u20132009."]}, {"page": "Great Yarmouth", "response": ["*Naomi Lewis (1911\u20132009) poet, essayist, critic and children's story tellerThe Guardian, Obituary, 14 July 2009, Obituary, Naomi Lewis.
