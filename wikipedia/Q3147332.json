The Palace youngsters also won the FA Youth Cup with a side including Kenny Sansom, Vince Hilaire and Billy Gilbert. The following season, 1977\u201378, saw the youth team become the first to win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea did in 1959\u201360 and 1960\u201361. These talented young players had become regulars in the first team by the 1978\u201379 season, which saw Palace vying not only for promotion, but also the Second Division title. The final game of the season was on a Friday night at home to Burnley on 11 May 1979. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,482, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and they would be crowned champions; a draw would mean promotion for Palace, but they would hand the title to fierce rivals Brighton; a defeat would see Sunderland clinch the final promotion place instead of Palace. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed Ian Walsh to head the opener, before a great run by David Swindlehurst was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2\u20130 win.

He took charge of his first match in May 1980 against England and met his players for the first time only three days before the match. England had beaten reigning World Cup holders Argentina four days prior but Wales recorded an upset by winning 4\u20131 at the Racecourse with goals from Mickey Thomas, James, Ian Walsh and an own goal. The victory was their first home win over England for 25 years and remains their biggest win over their opponents, while the nature of the defeat led to violent clashes between the two sets of supporters. However, Wales were unable to capitalise on their victory, losing both of their remaining fixtures to finish third in the 1979\u201380 British Home Championship. England's first qualifying campaign in his new role was for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and consecutive 4\u20130 victories over Iceland and Turkey in their opening games led him to declare that Wales were \"heading for the finals in 1982\". His confidence was further raised when they defeated both Czechoslovakia and Turkey 1\u20130 to win their opening four games."]}]}}
