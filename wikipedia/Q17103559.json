He was born and also died at Sharnford, Leicestershire.\nHarris's top-class cricket career was largely confined to 1859, when he appeared as a batsman and bowler of unknown style in several non-first-class matches as well as in Cambridge's four first-class fixtures, which included the University match. No great indication of his merits in either batting or bowling can be gained, as his bowling figures are incomplete and he never took more than two wickets in an innings, and his position in the batting order varied between the tail-end and occasional outings as an opening batsman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Harris", "response": ["James Harris may refer to:", "*James Harris (grammarian) (1709\u20131780), English politician and grammarian", "*James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury (1746\u20131820), English diplomat", "*James Harris (Nova Scotia politician) (1777\u20131848), Canadian politician in Nova Scotia", "*James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury (1807\u20131889), British statesman", "*James Harris (North Carolina politician) (1832\u20131891), African-American North Carolina politician", "*James Harris, 5th Earl of Malmesbury (1872\u20131950), British peer and Conservative politician", "*James Harris (Socialist Workers Party politician) (born 1948), 2000 and 2004 United States presidential candidate for the Socialist Workers Party", "*James Harris (defensive end) (born 1968), American football former player", "*James Harris (linebacker) (born 1982), American football fullback/linebacker", "*James Harris, 2nd Earl of Malmesbury (1778\u20131841), British hunter", "*Kamala (wrestler) (James Harris, 1950\u20132020), American professional wrestler", "*James Harris (rugby union) (born 1987), Welsh rugby union player", "*James Harris (cricketer, born 1990), Welsh cricketer", "*James Harris (cricketer, born 1838) (1838\u20131925), English soldier and cricketer", "*James Harris (Kittitian cricketer) (born 1954), Kittitian cricketer", "*James Harris (sprinter) (born 1991), American sprinter", "*James Harris (comedy writer) (21st century), British comedian", "*James Harris (solicitor) (1940\u20132004), British legal scholar", "*\"The Daemon Lover\" aka \"James Harris\", British ballad"]}]}}
