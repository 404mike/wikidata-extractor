The Ipswich result was compounded by Stephen Pearson earning a two match ban after being sent off for foul and abusive language and manager Nigel Clough earning a charge of improper conduct after he was sent to the stands. He was fined \u00a31,000 and given a one-match ban which he served during the final game of the campaign against Cardiff City. A 0\u20130 draw with Barnsley left the club needing just a point from its final three games to guarantee survival, which duly arrived with a 1\u20131 draw with Crystal Palace on 17 April 2010. This meant that it was not possible for both Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday to overtake The Rams as they played each other at Hillsborough on the final day of the season and ensured safety and Derby's place in the 2010\u201311 Football League Championship. Safety meant that Steve Davies and Stephen Bywater were both rested for the remainder of the campaign, Davies having an ankle operation and Bywater resting a sprained rib joint. Bywater's injury resulted in Ross Atkins being recalled from a loan spell with Kidderminster Harriers.

The promise of the imminent return of the defensive trio was dampened by the news first-choice goalkeeper Stephen Bywater has been ruled out for four weeks with a wrist injury sustained in training. The club moved to bring in a loan keeper, as they had the previous campaign while Bywater was suspended, and were linked with former number one Lee Grant and former target, Blackburn Rovers stopper Frank Fielding. Fielding eventually joined ahead of the Preston North End game on an emergency four-week deal. Saul Deeney was then ruled out of contention due to being placed on compassionate leave due to a serious family illness, leading to a recall for Ross Atkins from his loan spell at Tamworth, with James Severn instead sent to the club as a compensatory replacement. Fielding kept a clean sheet on his debut, a 3\u20130 victory over Preston North End and then helped The Rams to a second consecutive win as they beat Doncaster Rovers 3\u20132 at Keepmoat Stadium to reach 7th in the table, the club's highest league position since the opening day of the 2009\u201310 season. The run ended with a 2\u20130 reverse at Millwall, though a 4\u20131 home win over Watford saw The Rams end the month with 10 points from a possible 15. Tomasz Cywka grabbed a brace in the win, which earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week.", "In terms of playing staff, Stephen Bywater and Saul Deeney returned to availability after six weeks out, though Frank Fielding's loan from Blackburn Rovers was still extended after his seven appearances had reaped three clean sheet and 15 points from a possible 21. Luke Moore's loan was also extended to a third and final month. The return of Deeney and Bywater took Derby's available goalkeepers to four, meaning Ross Atkins was able to return to Tamworth on loan, with James Severn returning to Derby after six appearances for the non-league outfit. The club was also linked with a move for Bryne striker Geir Andr\u00e9 Herrem. It was revealed that Blackpool intended to complete a deal for on-loan Luke Varney, who had notched four goals in his loan spell at the Premier League team. Blackpool, manager Ian Holloway claimed that Blackpool had a \"massive clause\" in the loan deal which meant they could sign Varney for just \u00a3250k in the January 2011 transfer window, though Derby denied this saying Varney could be sold to any club and that no deal is in place with Blackpool.

Contract-rebel Kris Commons joined Celtic for a fee of around \u00a3300k, turning down a \u00a3500k overture from Celtic's Old Firm rivals who failed to match his wage demands. Left back Dean Moxey was the subject of a \u00a3400,000 bid from Crystal Palace, which was accepted by Derby. Clough stated the bid's acceptance was football, rather than financially related, explaining \"He (Moxey) has not really progressed this season as much as we hoped. We just thought it was a good offer. We have got another good left back in Gareth Roberts and we can always get cover in on loan if we need it.\" Other departures saw Medi Abalimba, whose contract at Derby was terminated but the club held onto his registration, join Oldham Athletic on a free and the young trio of Graham Kelly, Mitchell Hanson and Kallum Keane had their contracts canceled five months early by mutual consent. Temporary departures saw Ross Atkins extend his stay at Tamworth and Greg Mills rejoin Telford on season long deals. Dave Martin moved on a month-long loan to League One side Notts County.", "With the re-opening of the loan window, Derby signed Liverpool's Daniel Ayala, Sheffield United's Jamie Ward and Millwall's Theo Robinson on loan deals until the end of the season.

Despite losing their next two games (Burnley and Norwich City) safety was confirmed on Easter Monday 2011, when results elsewhere assured The Rams could not be caught by their relegation rivals in the bottom three. With safety assured, Shaun Barker had surgery on a knee problem which had been an issue throughout most of his two years at Derby and had prevented him from training for the majority of the end of the 2010\u201311 season. Barker took to the pitch prior to the start of the last home game of the season against Bristol City to hand over his 2009\u201310 Jack Stamps Trophy to John Brayford. The match ended in a 0\u20132 defeat and meant that Derby lost 11 of their 23 home games throughout the campaign. In a post-match interview Clough stated that whilst talking with the fellow management staff during the game he had wondered \"How many of those players out who started today we want out there on 6 August (and the answer is) not too many\" and that he intended to bring in \"6, 8, maybe 10\" new players in the close season. Flying in the face of such talk of Clough restructuring was press speculation that Clough, fearing interference, would quit his position at Derby to return to Burton Albion.
