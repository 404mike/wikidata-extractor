Mendlesohn is also known for books on the history of fantasy, including Children's Fantasy Literature: An Introduction, co-written with Michael Levy.

Its underlying themes run counter to those in Lord of the Flies, however, in that it shows a belief in the inherent strength of humans as proto-adults who can self-organize rather than descend into barbarism. Some of the students fall victim to their own foolishness, and others turn out to be thugs, but that is a part of human nature, just as the counter-trends take the group as a whole towards the beginnings of a stable society. The numerous political crises of the fledgling colony illustrate the need for legitimacy in a government appropriate for the society it administers, another common theme in Heinlein's books. In both its romanticization of the pioneer and its glorification of Homo sapiens as the toughest player in the Darwinian game, it presages themes developed further in books like Time Enough for Love and Starship Troopers. Unusual for science fiction at the time, but quite typical of Heinlein's works, the novel portrays several competent and intelligent female characters.James, Edward and Farah Mendlesohn (2003).

Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel", "response": ["The winning novel is selected by a panel of science fiction experts, intended to be \"small enough to discuss among its members all of the nominated novels\". Among members of the panel have been Gregory Benford, Paul A. Carter, James Gunn, Elizabeth Anne Hull, Christopher McKitterick, Farah Mendlesohn, Pamela Sargent, and Tom Shippey. In 2008 Mendlesohn was replaced with Paul Kincaid, in 2009 Carter left the panel while Paul Di Filippo and Sheila Finch joined, and Lisa Yaszek replaced Di Filippo in 2016. Nominations are submitted by publishers and jurors, and are collated by the panel into a list of finalists to be voted on. The minimum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Sturgeon Award. The award has been given at the conference since 1979; prior to then it was awarded at various locations around the world, starting at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1973. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. The Center for the Study of Science Fiction maintains a trophy which records all of the winners on engraved plaques affixed to the sides, and since 2004 winners have received a smaller personalized trophy as well. In 2019, the Center for the Study of Science Fiction announced plans to rename both the conference and the award, but did not announce any names. Both the conference and the award were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."]}, {"page": "BSFA Award", "response": [":Non-fiction: Reading Science Fiction by Farah Mendlesohn", ":Non-fiction: Rhetorics of Fantasy by Farah Mendlesohn", ":Non-Fiction: The Pleasant Profession of Robert A.

Her most famous work, the Realm of the Elderlings, is secondary-world fantasy, with the Farseer novels narrated in the form of a first-person retrospective. This has been described as an unusual approach in fantasy, with the limited first-person narrative lending itself to a focus on characters' internal conflicts. Her earlier writing as Megan Lindholm employs a different style: under this pseudonym, she is known for short-form science fiction and urban fantasy. Her 1986 novel Wizard of the Pigeons has been cited as a forerunner of the urban fantasy genre, with scholar Farah Mendlesohn describing it as liminal fantasy that pairs \"plain descriptions of the fantastic [...] with baroque descriptions of the real\". Hobb herself has said that she employs different voices for the two pseudonyms, with Lindholm's voice \"a little more snarky, a little more sarcastic, a little less optimistic, less emotional\", and more attuned to dark, urban fantasy.

The long-running series of light fantasies by Piers Anthony (Xanth) and Terry Pratchett (Discworld) regularly hit the bestseller lists from the 1980s onward. Notable books of the 1990s include Robert Jordan's popular series Wheel of Time, Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series and George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire (the basis of the American fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones).Farah Mendlesohn, A Short History of Fantasy,  A Song of Ice and Fire is considered a path-breaking work which paved the way for a new kind of fantasy referred to as grimdark, which was less idealistic and more violent in nature. With J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, which have become the best selling book series of all time, fantasy is becoming increasingly intertwined with mainstream fiction; a process aided by the international popularity of other works such as Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle, Ranger's Apprentice by John Flanagan, Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive, and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. The success of major film adaptations such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia film series has helped further this trend."]}, {"page": "63rd World Science Fiction Convention", "response": ["* Best Related Book: The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction, edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn"]}, {"page": "Edward James (historian)", "response": ["Edward Frederick James (born 14 May 1947) is a British scholar of medieval history and science fiction.
