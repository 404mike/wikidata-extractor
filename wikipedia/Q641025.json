It was in the 1838\u201339 session of the Royal Society that James Halliwell, who was not a Freemason,  delivered a paper on \"The early History of Freemasonry in England\", based on the Regius, which was published in 1840. The manuscript was dated to 1390, and supported by such authorities as Woodford and Hughan; the dating of Edward Augustus Bond, the curator of manuscripts at the British Museum, to fifty years later was largely sidelined. Hughan also mentions that it was probably written by a priest.William James Hughan, The Old Charges of British Freemasons, London, 1872, pp 2-3"]}, {"page": "Royal Warrant of Precedence", "response": ["|Edward Augustus Bond (KCB)"]}, {"page": "List of directors of the British Museum", "response": ["* 1873\u20131888: Sir Edward Augustus Bond "]}, {"page": "Edward August Bond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Augustus Bond"]}, {"page": "Bond, Edward August", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Augustus Bond"]}, {"page": "Edward Bond (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Edward Augustus Bond (1815\u20131898), English librarian"]}, {"page": "E.
