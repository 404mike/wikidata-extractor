This was paced slowly enough for children to read captions and subtitles, but it had been noted in surveys that a favourite programme for deaf children was Top of the Pops, due to its lively and fast-moving format and the fact that even the profoundly deaf could still enjoy the music's lower frequency notes. Dowling and Eason took the concept and turned it in 1964 into Vision On, front by mime actress Pat Keysell (Eason's former PA) and artist Tony Hart. The aim of the programme was to entertain but also to encourage imagination, with a fast-paced flow of contrasting ideas, both sane and silly. The series ran for twelve years and, while retaining a commitment to the deaf, attracted a wider following. It gained several awards including the international Prix Jeunesse and the BAFTA Award for Specialised Programmes."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama", "response": ["* Pat Keysell"]}]}}
