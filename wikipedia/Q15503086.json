Robens was unexpectedly and somewhat controversially elevated to the chairmanship of the National Coal Board, and Milne, a trades union official, was selected by the local Constituency Labour Party and with the support of the shopworkers union, USDAW.\nDuring his Parliamentary career, Milne became increasingly concerned about problems of endemic corruption within local government in the north east of England. These were eventually revealed in the Poulson Affair involving corruption leading Labour movement figures Andrew Cunningham and T. Dan Smith. Known as a difficult man to get on with, Milne's problems were not restricted to his opponents in the local Labour Party; he twice unsuccessfully reported a local journalist, Jim Harland, to the Press Council over articles he had written.By 1974 the breach between Milne and the local party was irreparable, and he was deselected on the eve of the February 1974 general election. Milne had already made preparations for this eventuality and ran a campaign as an Independent Labour candidate. He overturned the Labour majority and defeated Ivor Richard, who had the official endorsement, by 6,140 votes.\nHowever, it was a short-lived victory, as Milne was narrowly defeated in the October 1974 general election by John Ryman by 78 votes.\nMilne's supporters who won seats on the local authority had all been defeated by 1979; when Milne stood again in the 1979 general election he did badly.\nAspect of Milne's life are heavily mirrored by the character Eddie Mills, in Peter Flannery's 1996 television serial Our Friends In The North, particularly his fight against corruption in local government, and his election as an Independent Labour MP in 1974.\nMilne wrote a book entitled No Shining Armour (1976) (ISBN 0-7145-3514-1) detailing his travails with the local party, and giving his view on the corruption scandals of the 1970s. It attracted 36 libel writs, and the costs and damages associated with it came close to bankrupting his publishers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Eddie MilneElected as a Labour MP"]}, {"page": "Edward Milne", "response": ["*Eddie Milne (1915\u20131983), British Labour Party Member of Parliament for Blyth, afterwards re-elected as an independent"]}, {"page": "Blyth Valley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"|Eddie Milne"]}, {"page": "Alfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham", "response": ["Robens took up his appointment at the NCB in 1961 at a salary believed to be \u00a310,000 a year (which was never increased throughout his ten years in office) and was created a life peer as Baron Robens of Woldingham, of Woldingham in the County of Surrey, on 28 June. Amongst those critical of this sudden elevation were his successor as MP for Blyth, Eddie Milne. Robens' leadership of the NCB was high-handed. He expected unflinching loyalty from colleagues and subordinates alike, and was confrontational with politicians. He enjoyed the trappings of power including a Daimler with the vehicle registration number \"NCB 1\", an executive aeroplane (a six-seater De Havilland Dove which he and other Board members used to visit the far-flung coalfields) and a flat in Eaton Square. His behaviour earned him the nickname \"Old King Coal\", a pun on Old King Cole. However, he threw himself into the job with vigour and enthusiasm, visiting pits, arguing with miners at the coalface and developing a deep knowledge of the industry. In 1963 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland.
