At Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium, Simeon Jackson scored from a cross by Andy Barcham to give Gillingham the lead in the 13th minute, only for Chris Dagnall to equalise for Rochdale in the 36th minute.  Jackson scored a second goal with a penalty kick in the 58th minute after John Nutter had been fouled by Rory McArdle.  Gillingham thus won the match 2\u20131 and won their semi-final on aggregate by the same score.  Gillingham manager Mark Stimson was quoted as saying that reaching the final was just reward for his players' commitment throughout the season.  At Bury's Gigg Lane, Shrewsbury goalkeeper Daniels saved a penalty kick by Bury's Phil Jevons and Kevin McIntyre scored a goal for the away team in the 88th minute to level the aggregate score at 1\u20131 and require extra time to be played.  Shortly after the start of the extra period, Shrewsbury's Steve Leslie was sent off.  With no further goals being scored in extra time, the semi-final ended in a draw and a penalty shoot-out was required to decide which team would advance to the final.  Daniels saved penalty kicks from Bury's Andy Bishop and Danny Racchi and Shrewsbury won the shoot-out and thus reached the final.

Daniels saved a first-half penalty from Phil Jevons, however with time running out Kevin McIntyre scored a spectacular 88th minute volley to take the tie into extra time. Daniels was to keep Shrewsbury in the tie during extra-time as Bury tried to finish the game, with Shrewsbury's plight being made tougher after midfielder Steve Leslie was controversially sent off just seconds into extra time. However, with the scores 1\u20131 on aggregate, Shrewsbury were to convert all four of their spot-kicks in the penalty shootout, with Daniels making two saves to send Shrewsbury through 4\u20133 on aggregate.", "On 30 April 2010, after a disappointing 2009\u201310 season, Paul Simpson was dismissed as manager of Shrewsbury Town with two games remaining. Three Caretaker managers were installed for the remaining two games, reserve team manager Stuart Delaney, youth team coach David Hughes and former club captain Mike Jackson. Shrewsbury finished a measurable 12th after showing signs throughout the campaign of at least finishing in a play off spot, even briefly challenging for the automatic spots around the New Year period.  Coincidentally, performances in their last two games noticeably improved after Simpson's dismissal. Even with the absence of top-scorer Dave Hibbert during the games, the Town showed positive attacking football. A draw against Morecambe on 1 May would've even made the playoffs still mathematically possible, although taking into account other team results. The game ended in a 3\u20132 defeat after Kevin McIntyre's failed attempt to level it 3\u20133 in added time from the penalty spot. They went to local rivals Port Vale on the final day of the season and despite the circumstances, finished the season with relatively strong form. They managed a draw with Vale, the home side only managing to equalise from the penalty spot."]}, {"page": "List of Macclesfield Town F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Kevin McIntyre"]}]}}
