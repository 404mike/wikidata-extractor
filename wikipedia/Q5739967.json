It was arranged that he would exchange with Pinney in the 35th Division, and the transfer was made on 23 September.Dunn (1994), pp. xl\u2013xli The decision to rotate commanders appears to have been a desire to give Landon a less active command, as the 35th was occupying a relatively quiet sector; presumably, it was felt that Pinney was a more effective commander for an active division.Dunn (1994), p. 260 When Pinney met the officers of one of his new battalions in early October 1916, they recorded that he seemed \"pleasant and human\", and \"not too old\".Dunn (1994), p. 263 However, some of his habits were unpopular; most gallingly to his men, he stopped the regular issue of rum in the division shortly after taking command, replacing it with tea instead. The infantry were greatly displeased, with one NCO describing him as \"a bun-pinching crank, more suited to command of a Church Mission hut than troops\".Dunn (1994), p. xli There was some justification to the jibe; as well as being teetotal, Pinney did not smoke, and was devoutly religious. The most lasting description of him was written in this period by Siegfried Sassoon, then an officer in one of the 33rd's battalions, who used Pinney as the subject of his satirical poem \"The General\".Dunn (1994), p. xli.
