The away side took the lead after just five minutes; Chris Day spilled Marc Richards' free-kick, and Paul Parry was there to prod the ball into the goal on the rebound. Stevenage equalised twenty minutes later when Darius Charles ran from his own half before striking a curling shot from 25-yards that beat Chris Weale in the Shrewsbury goal. A 2\u20131 away victory against recently relegated Coventry City followed on 9 September, with the game being televised live on Sky Sports. Coventry took the lead after eleven minutes when loanee David McGoldrick turned on the edge of the area, before striking a curling effort into the top corner of the goal. Stevenage equalised ten minutes later when a counterattack culminated with a Luke Freeman shot being parried into the path of an onrushing Robin Shroot, who swept the ball home from just inside the area. The comeback was completed with twenty minutes remaining, substitute Marcus Haber heading in Darius Charles' flick on from a Freeman corner. Six days later, Stevenage faced newly promoted Crewe Alexandra at Broadhall Way. Crewe started brightly and opened the scoring after just six minutes. A Gregor Robertson free-kick was blocked, but found its way to Max Clayton on the left wing, who rifled the ball across goal where A-Jay Leitch-Smith was on hand to connect from close range. Leitch-Smith doubled Crewe's advantage almost instantly, running on to a neat Chuks Aneke pass before finishing calmly with a low driven shot. Luke Freeman halved Stevenage's deficit midway through the first-half when he unleashed a shot from 25-yards, following good work from Patrick Agyemang and Lucas Akins, which left Crewe goalkeeper Alan Martin rooted to the spot. Former Stevenage loanee, Aneke, was sent-off for Crewe in the second half for a two-footed tackle on Anthony Grant. The home side made their numerical advantage count when substitute Robin Shroot scored with a neat turn and finish with ten minutes remaining. A 3\u20131 home victory over Walsall followed on 18 September. Robin Shroot had given Stevenage a first-half lead with a tidy finish from outside the area, before Walsall's George Bowerman equalised on the hour mark. The home side restored their lead through Greg Tansey, who scored with a driven shot from 30-yards, his first goal for the club. Lucas Akins sealed the victory late-on, when he steered in Tansey's cross at the back post. A week later, on 22 September, Stevenage drew 1\u20131 at Doncaster Rovers. Loan signing Oliver Risser headed Stevenage into the lead, before Doncaster's Chris Brown levelled in the second-half. The month ended with a 2\u20132 against Bury at Broadhall Way. The visitors, under the new management of Kevin Blackwell, opened the scoring through Tom Hopper's looping header. After the interval, Stevenage scored twice within the space of two minutes to turn the game on its head. Marcus Haber headed in Luke Freeman's corner to restore parity, before Greg Tansey scored a curling long-range strike. Bury equalised through second-half substitute Mark Cullen, to ensure a share of the spoils."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["*30 May 2014 \u2013 Tom Hopper signs a two-year contract extension until the summer of 2016.", "| Tom Hopper"]}, {"page": "Jacob Murphy", "response": ["After his loan spell at Blackpool came to an end, Murphy joined League One club Scunthorpe United on a month-long loan.
