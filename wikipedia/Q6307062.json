His wife, the Hon. Mrs Julian Clifford, was a soprano singer. After his early death his example was followed by their son, also Julian Clifford (born 1903), who was a composer and a conductor working for Decca Records in early days, and championed works by English composers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Henderson (baritone)", "response": ["He then began to obtain many engagements both in opera and in oratorio. He had seasons at Covent Garden, including Wagner roles, in 1928 and 1929. In 1929 at the Delius Festival under Sir Thomas Beecham, Henderson distinguished himself and was acclaimed by Delius as the unequalled interpreter of Zarathustra in A Mass of Life.This performance was with Miriam Licette, Astra Desmond and Tudor Davies, the Philharmonic Choir and BBC Symphony Orchestra, see R. Elkin, Queen's Hall, 1893-1941 (Rider & Co, London 1944), 79.The Delius Society Journal no. 92, Winter 1986-87, carried an extensive interview with Henderson about his Delius work and a review of his Delian recordings, Read here. His performances of Delius's Sea Drift (a part created by Frederic Austin) were also considered masterly. Beecham had recorded this work with the baritone Dennis Noble in 1928, but this was not issued owing to unsatisfactory acoustics. In 1929 the Decca record company was established by (Sir) Edward Lewis, and in May 1929 Henderson was recruited to record the work as one of Decca's first issues.6 sides, Decca S10010-10012.

There is also a recording of Songs of Sunset from the 1934 Leeds Festival under Beecham."]}, {"page": "Ernest Farrar", "response": ["Ernest Farrar was born in Lewisham, London, but moved in 1887 to Micklefield in Yorkshire, where his father was a clergyman. The rest of his life was very much centred in the North of England. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School, where he began organ studies and in May 1905 won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. His studies at Durham University did not progress beyond his matriculation. There he studied with Sir Charles Villiers Stanford and Sir Walter Parratt and began a friendship with Frank Bridge.Behind the Lines: the music and composers of the first world war He also took up several posts as organist in All Saints' Dresden, St Hilda's, South Shields and Christ Church, High Harrogate. At Harrogate, he worked closely with local conductor Julian Clifford and took on the 14-year-old Gerald Finzi as a composition pupil. In 1913, he married Olive Mason in South Shields. His best man at the wedding was Ernest Bullock.", "His grave lies just outside the churchyard wall in Ronssoy Communal Cemetery Extension, in a corner under a few trees. A Requiem Mass was said at Micklefield, on 29 September, the Feast of St. Michael and All Angels. A concert was dedicated to his memory at Harrogate by Julian Clifford on 17 September 1919, including a tone-poem Lights Out written expressly for Farrar, and Farrar's work Variations in G for pianoforte and orchestra on an old British sea-song."]}, {"page": "A London Symphony", "response": ["The work was first performed on 27 March 1914 at Queen's Hall, conducted by Geoffrey Toye. The performance was a success. Shortly afterwards, the composer sent the score to the conductor Fritz Busch in Germany, and the original score disappeared in the upheaval of the outbreak of World War I.Kennedy, Michael, A Catalogue of the Works of Vaughan Williams', Oxford University Press, 1964, p. 73. Kennedy quotes a letter from the composer: \"I think it was [Donald] Tovey who suggested I should send it to Busch\" The second performance was given in Harrogate on 12 August 1914 by the Harrogate Municipal Orchestra under Julian Clifford. There was a short score, which had been prepared by Bevis Ellis, Francis Toye and George Butterworth, so it is possible that version was used instead. The composer, aided by Geoffrey Toye, Butterworth and the critic E. J. Dent, reconstructed the score from the orchestral parts, and the reconstruction was performed on 11 February 1915 by the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra under Dan Godfrey."]}, {"page": "Sea Drift (Delius)", "response": ["The first commercial recording of Sea Drift was issued in 1929 by Decca Records.  The set of three 78rpm discs featured baritone Roy Henderson with the New English Symphony Orchestra and Chorus; however, the recording was pulled by Decca after a limited time (before 1936R. D. Darrell, The Gramophone Shop Encyclopedia of Recorded Music (New York, 1936).) because it fitted poorly across six record sides, and on account of contract issues related to the conductor (who went unnamed on the recording).The identity of the conductor is also disputed, between Julian Clifford (Decca listings, Decca Classical, 1929-2009 Discography by Philip Stuart (July 2009 Edition), pdf page 35 for 29 May in Chelsea, issued July 1929): Anthony Bernard (according to Jelka Delius: see Lionel Carley, Jelka Rosen Delius: Artist, Admirer and Friend of Rodin.
