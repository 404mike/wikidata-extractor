In 1681, he saw several Covenanters martyred in Edinburgh, including Donald Cargill. He witnessed the execution of Donald Cargill at the cross of Edinburgh on 27 July 1681, and the spectacle determined him to cast in his lot with the adherents to the Sanquhar declaration of 22 June 1680, popularly known as Cameronians, from Richard Cameron. Accordingly, in October 1681, he organised a secret meeting of members of this party, probably a field-conventicle, and by his earnest zeal did much to rally them to renewed action. A correspondence was instituted between the Societies of sympathisers in various parts of the west of Scotland. Renwick, at Lanark, on 12 January 1682, publicly proclaimed what was known as the Lanark declaration. He was not its author (it was written on 15 December 1681), and admitted that some of its vehement language against the existing authorities (\u2018a brothel, rather than a court\u2019) was ill-advised. Sir Alexander Gordon of Earlston, who had been commissioned to Holland by the Societies in March 1682, made arrangements for Renwick to pursue his theological studies there, with a view to ordination.", "Renwick refused to join the insurrection of 1685 under Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll. He was in sympathy with its object, but held aloof from a movement not distinctly put on the basis of the covenant. Hence he alienated many of his own party. His old friend, Sir Alexander Gordon, then a prisoner at Blackness, turned against him. He was viewed as a man who would only act by himself. Robert Cathcart, a Wigtonshire covenanter, protested against him; Alexander Peden was estranged from him, though they were reconciled on Peden's deathbed; Henry Erskine peremptorily rejected his overtures.

From 1757 he associated also with John Taylor, who in that year became divinity tutor at Warrington Academy; and in 1761 he preached Taylor's funeral sermon at Chowbent, Lancashire. An appendix to the printed sermon takes Taylor's side in disputes about the Academy, against John Seddon, and shows, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, that Harwood was by this time at one with Taylor's semi-Arian theology; although he says that he never adopted the tenets of Arius.

The book then proceeds to a number of specific themes.", "The relationship between Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton has been subject to considerable speculation from historians.  William Lamont has argued that Muggleton had been the first to experience divine revelations and that Reeve was envious.Lamont, \"The Muggletonians 1652\u20131979: A 'Vertical' Approach,\" Past and Present, No. 99 (1983), 22\u201340. . Christopher Hill, on the other hand, has argued that Muggleton recast the events of 1651\u201352 after Reeve's death to put himself in a better light.Hill, \"The Muggletonians,\" Past and Present, No. 104 (1984), 153\u201359. . Alexander Gordon may have got nearer the mark with the simplest possible explanation. It was all down to differences of personality. Reeve was a somewhat hot-headed ideologue whereas Muggleton was content with the virtues of a quiet, still people. It might also be a matter of timing. Reeve lived six years in the faith; Muggleton 46 years. The faith had certainly started with the most urgent tidings of apocalypse. As time ticked by and the world remained stubbornly unchanging, something we might call \"St Paul's syndrome\" may have set in; making it necessary to accommodate this lengthening perspective. Had Reeve lived, he too would have faced the same adjustments, although that is not to say he would have chosen the same solution."]}, {"page": "Alexander Gordon", "response": ["Alexander Gordon may refer to:", "* Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly (died 1470), Scottish magnate", "* Alexander Gordon (bishop of Aberdeen) (died 1518), Precentor of Moray and Bishop-elect of Aberdeen", "* Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly (died 1524), Scottish nobleman", "* Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland (died 1530), Scottish magnate", "* Alexander Gordon (bishop of Galloway) (died 1575), formerly bishop of the Isles and archbishop of Glasgow", "* Alexander Gordon (pioneer) (1635\u20131697), Scottish settler in New England", "* Alexander Gordon (general) (1670\u20131752), Laird of Auchintoul, Scottish general of the Russian army and Jacobite", "* Alexander Gordon (antiquary) (c. 1692\u20131755), Scottish antiquary and singer", "* Alexander Gordon, 2nd Duke of Gordon (c. 1678\u20131728), Scottish peer", "* Alexander Gordon, 18th-century British founder of Gordon's Gin", "* Alexander Gordon, Lord Rockville (1739\u20131792), Scottish judge", "* Alexander Gordon (physician) (1752\u20131799), Scottish physician", "* Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon (1743\u20131827), Scottish nobleman", "* Alexander Gordon (British cavalry officer) (1781\u20131873), British Army officer during the Napoleonic Wars", "* Sir Alexander Gordon (British staff officer) (1786\u20131815), British Army officer who was killed at the Battle of Waterloo", "* Alexander Gordon (Australian politician) (1815\u20131903), English-born Australian politician and barrister", "* Alexander Gordon (Unitarian) (1841\u20131931), English Unitarian minister and religious historian", "* Sir Alexander Gordon (Northern Ireland politician) (1882\u20131967)", "* Alexander Gordon, 7th Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair (1955\u20132020), British peer ", "* Alexander Gordon (journalist) (born 1964), Russian radio and television presenter, journalist, actor and director", "* Alexander Gordon (brewer) (1818-1895), Scottish brewer and philanthropist", "* Alexander Gordon Smith (born 1979), British author"]}, {"page": "Thomas Tomkinson", "response": ["Thomas Tomkinson (1631\u20131710) was an English Muggletonian writer born at Ilam, near Dovedale, in Staffordshire.

He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 16 June 1610, at the age of twenty, and graduated B.A. on 23 May 1612, having already been ordained deacon by John Bridges, bishop of Oxford. A nonconformist, he went over to Ireland, where he was probably ordained presbyter by Robert Echlin, bishop of Down and Connor. On 7 July 1619 Echlin admitted him to the vicarage of Antrim, on the presentation of Arthur Chichester. He built up his church (founded 1596), and gained a reputation as a preacher. He has been described as a presbyterian, but Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography disagrees.", "About 1626 Hugh Campbell, a layman from Ayrshire, established a meeting on the last Friday of each month at his house in Oldstone, two miles from Antrim. Crowds of people attended, encouraged by James Glendinning, the vicar of Carnmoney. To counter Campbell Ridge began a meeting for preaching and conference on the first Friday of each month at Antrim, and called in the aid of Robert Blair, Robert Cunningham (d. 1637) of Holywood, co. Down, and James Hamilton. This was the origin of the Antrim meeting, an advisory body claiming no jurisdiction. According to Alexander Gordon, it was influential, and furnished the model of the Worcestershire agreement framed by Richard Baxter in 1652, and adopted in numerous English counties in place of the parliamentary presbyterianism; and through John Howe, a member of the Antrim meeting (1671-5) became the parent of the county unions formed among English dissenters after the passing of the Toleration Act 1688.", "The fame of the meeting brought to Antrim, about 1628, a company of English separatists and an Arminian, John Freeman, but they were unsuccessful in making proselytes. Ridge was one of the five beneficed clergy who, at the primary visitation of Henry Leslie at Lisburn in July 1636, refused to subscribe to the new canons, which were to assimilate the doctrine and ceremonies of the Irish church to those of England. The private conference which followed went unrecorded; in the public disputation with Leslie at Belfast (on 11 August) Ridge took no part, but when called up for sentence on 12 August he admitted that Leslie had given the five non-subscribers a fair, though not a full, hearing. Leslie thought his scruples arose from a melancholy temperament. He condemned him to 'perpetual silence within his diocese.' Alexander Gordon asserts that there had been no actual presbyterianism in Ireland to this point, and the question of the form of church government had not been seriously raised, and that was Leslie's action, prompted by John Bramhall, that laid the foundation of a revolt against episcopal authority."]}, {"page": "Alexander Gordon (Unitarian minister)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Gordon (Unitarian)"]}, {"page": "English Presbyterianism", "response": ["Presbyterianism in England is practised by followers of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism who practise the Presbyterian form of church government.  Dating in England as a movement from 1588, it is distinct from Continental and Scottish forms of Presbyterianism. The Unitarian historian Alexander Gordon (1841-1931) stated that, whereas in Scotland, church government is based on a meeting of delegates, in England the individual congregation is the primary body of government..  This was the practice in Gordon's day, however, most of the sixteenth and seventeenth century English theoreticians of Presbyterianism, such as Thomas Cartwright, John Paget, the Westminster Assembly of Divines and the London Provincial Assembly, envisaged a Presbyterian system composed of congregations, classes and synods.   Historically Presbyterians in England were subsumed into the United Reformed Church in 1972.
