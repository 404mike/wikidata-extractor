In the 1990s Grange Hill was repeated in full on digital satellite and cable channel UK Gold, which broadcast the late 1970s and early 80s episodes of the show. In 1998, it reappeared on sister channel UK Gold Classics, which was a digital-only channel showing programmes previously aired on UK Gold, and Grange Hill was part of its schedule. The channel lasted only six months, however, before becoming UK Gold 2 in April 1999. Interest in Grange Hill was renewed in the late 1990s and the series celebrated its 20th anniversary with the introduction of sinister Scottish bully Sean Pearce (Iain Robertson), who carried a knife and slashed the face of a classmate. Cast member Laura Sadler, who was heavily involved in this storyline, died after falling out of a building in June 2003; four years earlier her Grange Hill character Judi Jeffreys had been killed after slipping and falling out of the window of a burning storeroom in the school."]}, {"page": "George Calil", "response": ["He also starred in the BBC drama, Holby City, in which he played the drug dealing boyfriend of Sandy.

Kath's role in the story was originally supposed to be played out by Laura Sadler's character Sandy Harper. The actress died before filming her part and producers decided to rewrite the story to feature Kath. Pearson told Claire Brand from Inside Soap that \"I felt like I took it over and I was very ambivalent about those scenes.\" The story culminated in Kelly killing her mother Nina Yorke (Ellie Haddington), brother Nic Yorke (Liam Garrigan) and stabbing Kath. Following a number of patients dying on Keller, a Commission For Health report is published with a scathing review accusing the hospital of gross negligence. Helen Grant (Susannah York) decides to interview staff and find out who is responsible. Kelly is annoyed by the investigation and plots to frame Kath. When she is interviewed Kelly tells Helen that she thinks Kath is at fault. This leads Helen to focus her attention of Kath and they argue. The police and DI Jane Archer (Christine Entwisle) also begin to suspect that Kath is responsible. Following the death of another patient DI Archer returns again.

Sheffield believed that working in Michigan with Anton had made the character more \"career-oriented\" and \"more removed and aloof\". He also picked up traits that Anton had which further aggravate Ed. The actor concluded that \"Alex and Ed are two ambitious men who have their own perspectives on life.

Tom's home is broken into by a gang, which includes his own brother Marty (Tom McGovern). They force Tom to perform an operation on their accomplice John J (Christian Mortimer), despite being stuck in his home. Tom summons Ed to his house to help with the operation. Ed is shocked by Tom's actions and he decides he will not stand by Tom. Ed ads that says he is no longer in Tom's debt. Paul English of the Daily Record reported that the story would continue to play out when John J is admitted to their ward and Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) operates on him. Ric notices that John J has recently had surgery, which leaves Ed and Tom fearing for their careers. Tom concocts a plan and gives Sandy Harper (Laura Sadler) unclear instructions. When John J dies during further surgery, Tom and Ed discuss what to do next but no one suspects anything untoward. Tom tries to incriminate Sandy, who claims she misread John J's notes because Tom did not make them clear. Despite no suspicion on him, Ed continues to worry his colleagues will find out about the earlier operation. In January 2003, Ed becomes aware that Tom has a drinking problem and is operating while under the influence of alcohol. He becomes impatient and threatens to report his mentor. In June 2003, Marshall told a reporter from BBC Online that producers had planned even more stories between Ed and Tom."]}]}}
