He compensated for his lack of frontline action by often playing as a centre-back when either Ronnie McKinnon or Colin Jackson was injured, and when the duo were ruled out of the 1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, Johnstone (still only 18) deputised in the match against Dynamo Moscow."]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)", "response": ["Billy McNeill (nicknamed \"Cesar\") the former player and captain of The Lisbon Lions, took over as manager in August 1978.  The return from injury of Danny McGrain and shrewd signings such as winger Davie Provan and midfielder Murdo MacLeod helped McNeill strengthen a Celtic side that had finished fifth in the league previous season.  In May 1979 Celtic's final league fixture was an Old Firm fixture against Rangers at Parkhead.  A win would clinch the 1978\u201379 league title for Celtic, but any other result would leave Rangers as favourites for the league as they had two additional games to play.  Celtic attacked from the start but trailed 1\u20130 at half-time through an Alex MacDonald goal for Rangers.  Johnny Doyle was then sent-off in the second half, leaving Celtic a man down as well as a goal down.  Celtic though, responded in exhilarating style through goals from Roy Aitken and George McCluskey to go 2\u20131 ahead. Celtic's lead only lasted a couple of minutes, Bobby Russell equalising with a fine strike.  As the game neared the end, and with Celtic attacking relentlessly, a McCluskey cross was parried by Rangers goalkeeper Peter McCloy against one of his own defenders, Colin Jackson, and then rebounded back into the goal to put Celtic 3\u20132 ahead.  In the final minute Murdo MacLeod put the matter beyond doubt when he hammered home a powerful 20 yard strike to secure a 4\u20132 win on the night and clinch the title in the most dramatic of circumstances."]}, {"page": "History of Rangers F.C.", "response": ["The early season league form was terrible as the team failed to win any of the first six league matches but a run was put together. Things began to unravel, however, as leadership of the league evaporated. The team had to settle for second place behind champions Celtic. The pivotal match was a 4\u20132 Old Firm defeat at Parkhead. There was success for Greig in the national cup competitions. Victory in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final over Hibernian  required a second replay to separate the sides before Rangers eventually won 3\u20132. The 1979 Scottish League Cup Final ended in a 2\u20131 win for Rangers over a strong Aberdeen  with goals from Alex MacDonald and Colin Jackson."]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Colin Jackson, Bruce Rioch"]}]}}
