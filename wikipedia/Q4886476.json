The following year, the London Cab Company raised the charges it made to cab drivers, but the union led a successful strike, and the company instead agreed to lower its charges.  Membership peaked at 4,000, but had fallen to only 300 by the following year.  By 1894, the union was moribund, and the cab company decided this provided an opportunity to raise its charges again.  Workers decided against reviving the old union, and instead formed a new one, the London Cab Drivers' Trade Union, which by the end of the year already had 2,936 members.  Ben Smith was appointed as its first organiser, and he proved successful, membership reaching 6,850 by 1896, although it then began falling.  A combination of extensions to the London Underground and bus routes, and increased traffic congestion, was reducing demand for horse-drawn cabs.  In response, the union undertook a strike in 1904 in order to get employers to agree to reduce hire charges, in the hope of increasing business.  This succeed after only five days, and prompted many other cab drivers to join, membership rebounding to 6,121 by the end of the year."]}]}}
