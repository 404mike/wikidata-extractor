The promotion formed part of an incredible rise up the Football League with the club having been close to liquidation only ten years prior when they were in League Two, and as recently as 2008 had gone into administration and nearly lost their Football League status. The club have since surprised many by consolidating themselves in the Premier League, finishing 16th in their first season in the top flight and then an impressive 9th in their second season, in spite of having limited spending power in relation to modern day Premier League figures. Key to Bournemouth's success was keeping a core of home-grown players together that had risen through the leagues with the club, Harry Arter and Marc Pugh establishing themselves at the highest level, having been lower league players beforehand. They stayed in the Premier League for five seasons before getting relegated in 2019\u201320 on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "1987 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Marc Pugh, footballer"]}, {"page": "Pugh", "response": ["* Marc Pugh (born 1987), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Evan Horwood", "response": ["Horwood joined Darlington on a one-month loan in October 2006.
