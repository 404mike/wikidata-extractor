It was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band mixed it with Anders Hvenare and mastering was handled by Ted Jensen. Wyatt explained during an interview for The Aquarian Weekly that \"Silvia\" is likely \"the most autobiographical song\" on the band's 2009 self-titled debut album as it was inspired by a real event of a stripper Wyatt dated who \"straightened out\" and quit. According to Wyatt, the band especially liked the song because it shares names with Queen Silvia of Sweden. Music magazine Clash announced on 10 December 2009 that \"Silvia\" had been selected as the third single from the album. The announcement revealed it would coincide with a United Kingdom concert tour from January through February 2010.
