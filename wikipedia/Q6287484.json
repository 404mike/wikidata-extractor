The Treffry Tramways were eventually built from Newquay to St. Dennis with the branch line to East Wheal Rose, and the first load of ore left East Wheal Rose on 26 February 1849 in horse-drawn tubs.  1874 saw the Treffry's network of tramways taken over by the Cornwall Minerals Railway, who introduced steam locomotives to the line."]}, {"page": "Par, Cornwall", "response": ["===Joseph Treffry===", "Joseph Austen, born 1782, was an important Fowey businessman; he later changed his name to Joseph Treffry, and as that name is much better known it is used here.

With adjacent workings it became the rich and highly productive Fowey Consols mine. Treffry sought to build a tramway connection to Fowey Harbour from his workings, but was unable to acquire the necessary land, and instead he decided to develop a harbour at Par. He purchased the ferry and replaced it with a bridge in 1824, and started improvement of the harbour in 1829; it was completed in 1840.Cornwall Archaeological Unit, The Luxulyan Valley Project: an Archaeological and Historical Survey, Truro, 1988"]}, {"page": "Luxulyan railway station", "response": ["The first railway at Luxulyan was a horse-worked line from Par Harbour to Molinnis which was built by Joseph Treffry, opening on 18 May 1847.

The canal was supplemented by a horse-drawn tramway to Ponts Mill in 1855 and a separate tramway incline served the Par Consols mine on the hill behind the harbour. In 1860 a connection was made to the recently opened Cornwall Railway which was carried on a viaduct and embankment between the harbour and mine. The mine closed in 1869 and the main tramway was converted to locomotive haulage as the Cornwall Minerals Railway in 1874, but wagons continued to be moved by horses within the harbour complex.  Several years later a branch line was taken through an  bridge beneath the Cornish Main Line to serve new china clay processing works.

Starting in 1813, he undertook much rebuilding and renovation, the work continuing for about thirty years. In 1820 he rebuilt the high tower that Elizabeth Treffry had defended so staunchly. He tried to incorporate as much as possible of the Tudor structure into his new building. The house was inherited by the Rev Edward Treffry in the nineteenth century.
