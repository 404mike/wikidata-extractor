On her death, in 1976, having no children, she bequeathed her property and its contents to the National Trust.  The Trust later donated her father's manuscripts to the University of Sussex in Brighton, to ensure better public access to them.  She is buried in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church on the estate.", "link_mentions": {}}}
