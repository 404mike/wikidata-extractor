He was one of Britain's most successful producers in the 1950s and 1960s. While his recordings encompassed several forms of mainstream popular music, his most enduring contributions were to British pop music of the mid-1960s on records by Dusty Springfield, The Walker Brothers, and the early solo recordings of Scott Walker.

In 1958, Morley began an association with Welsh singer Shirley Bassey, including work for Bassey's recordings of \"The Banana Boat Song\" (1957), \"As I Love You\" (1958), which reached no. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1959, and \"Kiss Me Honey Kiss Me\" (1958). Morley was the head of an orchestra and a chorale at this team, releasing records as \"Wally Stott and His Orchestra\" and \"The Wally Stott Chorale\" respectively.
