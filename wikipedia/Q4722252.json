From 1857 until 1897, 18 recipients were gazetted after their deaths but only 12 of the next of kin received the actual medal. In the other six cases there was a memorandum stating that they would have been recommended for the VC had they survived. By 1899, the precedent had been established that the VC could be awarded posthumously if the recommendation for the award was submitted prior to the recipient's death from wounds. Two such awards were granted during the Second Boer War, the well known award to Frederick Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts VC and to Francis Parsons. In 1900 and 1901, three memoranda were issued for Herman Albrecht, Robert Digby-Jones and David Younger stating they would have been recommended for the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy restricted to the Second Boer War, it was announced in the London Gazette on 8 August 1902, that the next of kin of the three soldiers mentioned in memoranda would be sent medals. In the same gazette, the first three posthumous awards were gazetted to Alfred Atkinson, John Barry and Gustavus Coulson. In 1907, the posthumous policy was reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six officers and men. Although the Victoria Cross warrant was not amended to specifically include posthumous awards until 1920, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.Crook, MJ, Chapter 8 pp. 68\u201390"]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| Alfred Atkinson ||  British Army|| 1900 || Second Anglo-Boer War || Paardeberg"]}, {"page": "Green Howards", "response": ["* Sergeant Alfred Atkinson, VC (18 February 1900)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Paardeberg", "response": ["* Alfred Atkinson, Yorkshire Regiment, 18 February 1900."]}, {"page": "Atkinson (surname)", "response": ["* Alfred Atkinson, British soldier"]}, {"page": "List of people from Leeds", "response": ["* Alfred Atkinson VC - recipient of the Victoria Cross in 1900"]}]}}
