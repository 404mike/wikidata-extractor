He took four wickets in the match (the first being that of Rupert Roopnaraine), but it was not enough for him to keep his place in the side.\nIn 1967 he played five times, all in June and July, producing a career-best 4-112 against Essex and claiming 3-77 against Sussex a few days later, but John Snow's wicket in the latter game was the last he took: against Derbyshire the following week he bowled only two wicketless overs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baylis (surname)", "response": ["*Keith Baylis (born 1947), English cricketer"]}]}}
