He was wrong in the date of his birth and, moreover, the godmother of Lady Macclesfield's son was Dorothy Ousley, not Mrs Lloyd. There is nothing to show that Mrs Brett was the cruel and vindictive woman he describes her to be. Discrepancies in Savage's story made James Boswell suspicious, but the matter was thoroughly investigated for the first time by William Moy Thomas, who published the results of his research in Notes and Queries.  However, Clarence Tracy, in his seminal biography The Artificial Bastard did give weight to Savage's claims.  In Richard Holmes' Dr. Johnson and Mr. Savage the author, though not in complete agreement, did not discount Tracy's bias."]}, {"page": "William Thomas", "response": ["* William Moy Thomas (1828\u20131910), English journalist"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*William Moy Thomas, novelist and journalist."]}, {"page": "Moy Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Moy Thomas"]}, {"page": "Mark Melford", "response": ["He wrote at least one other farce based on a mental disorder, A Screw Loose, in 1893; and also a drama in four acts called The Maelstrom about a homicidal maniac.
