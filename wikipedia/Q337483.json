A strong speaker, he became popular in trade union circles for his denunciation of capitalism as unethical and his promise of a socialist utopia.  He was the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position he held in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. He broke with Labour policy in 1931, and was expelled from the party and excoriated as a turncoat, as the party was overwhelmingly crushed that year by the National Government coalition that Snowden supported. He was succeeded as Chancellor by Neville Chamberlain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 18", "response": ["*1864 \u2013 Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden, English politician, Chancellor of the Exchequer (d. 1937)"]}, {"page": "May 15", "response": ["*1937 \u2013 Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden, English politician, Chancellor of the Exchequer (b. 1864)"]}, {"page": "Philip Snowden", "response": ["#REDIRECTPhilip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden"]}, {"page": "Lord Snowden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden"]}, {"page": "Viscount Snowden", "response": ["#REDIRECTPhilip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden"]}]}}
