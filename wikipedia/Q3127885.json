Wales lost this game heavily, in a year that saw Scotland eventually win the championship and take the Triple Crown. The selectors reacted to the defeat by switching out half of the pack, replacing them with new caps; Bennett was one of the players to lose his position. Although not picked for the opening match of the 1892 Championship, Bennett was back in favour for the last two matches of the series, replacing Rowley Thomas. Despite the quality in the Welsh team, including their returning captain Arthur Gould, the Welsh were again beaten. The final game of the tournament, was a Wooden Spoon decider away to Ireland.
