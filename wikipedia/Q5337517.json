They entered Antwerp on 7 September and found the office of Union Mini\u00e8re. They discovered that over 1,000 tons of refined uranium had been sent to Germany, but about 150 tons still remained at Olen. They set out for Olen, where they located 68 tons, but another 80 tons were missing, having been shipped to France in 1940 ahead of the German invasion of Belgium. The capture of Eindhoven by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division allowed early access to another high priority target, the Philips plant there. Brigadier Edgar Williams, the 21st Army Group's Chief of Intelligence, facilitated the Alsos Mission's detour to Eindhoven, where it was able to interview Dutch scientists. Williams also furnished a detachment of Royal Engineers to transport and move the uranium from Olen. Groves had it shipped to England, and, ultimately, to the United States."]}, {"page": "Bill Williams", "response": ["* Edgar Williams (1912\u20131995), known as Bill, British Army officer and Oxford academic at Rhodes House"]}, {"page": "Rhodes House", "response": ["* Former Wardens of Rhodes House \u2013 Sir Francis Wylie, Sir Carleton Allen, Sir Edgar Williams, Dr Robin Fletcher, Sir Anthony Kenny, Dr John Rowett, Sir Colin Lucas, and Professor Donald Markwell.

Butler to join a team with two others in Hut 4 at Bletchley Park, the Italian subsection of the GC&CS. Dedicated to cracking the Italian Navy Hagelin code, the team were working in partnership with the Cairo-based team of the Eighth Army Intelligence Chief Brigadier Edgar Williams, who reported to General Bernard Montgomery. In June 1941 Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to sink Axis ships carrying supplies from Europe to Libya. With shipping losses increasing, from reading the resultant Ultra traffic the team learn that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the Luftwaffe in North Africa fell by 90 per cent. The cracking of Hagelin is considered to have been \"hugely significant\", so much that Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited Hut 4 on a visit to Bletchley Park to thank the team for their endeavours. After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes."]}, {"page": "Devlin Commission", "response": ["The chairman of the Commission of Inquiry was Patrick Devlin, born in 1905 and made a High Court judge at an early age in 1948. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1960, and in 1961 was made a Law Lord. He retired in 1964, when aged 58 although, under the Judicial Pensions Act 1959, he could have served until the age of 75. However, he later denied this was because he was disappointed at not being offered the more senior posts of Lord Chief Justice or Master of the Rolls.The Independent, (1992). Obituary of Lord Devlin. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord-devlin-1539619.html The other three Commissioners were Edgar Williams, later Sir Edgar, the Warden of the Oxford College Rhodes House, Sir Percy Wyn-Harris and Sir John Primrose. Although Inquiries can be dominated by their chairmen, and Devlin certainly possessed a powerful personality, it is clear that Devlin's colleagues were a formidable team. Williams, then an academic historian, had been a brigadier and Montgomery's wartime chief intelligence officer, Wyn-Harris had much African experience in Kenya and as Governor of the Gambia, although Primrose, a Scottish Lord Provost, was less significant figure.Simpson, (2002), The Devlin Commission, pp. 27\u20138 Despite Devlin being vouched for by a Minister, Lord Perth, he was hardly an establishment figure; Wyn-Harris a former governor was described as the personification of decency and fair play and the two other Commissioners were both experienced and independently-minded.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 80\u201384."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 1995", "response": ["*Edgar Williams, 82, British Army military intelligence officer and historian."]}]}}
