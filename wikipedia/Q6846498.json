When one of Top Gear's presenters, John Peel, gained his own programme, specially commissioned recording sessions had a new outlet. Most of the artists were relatively unknown even to Peel's listeners: he and his producer would often invite bands on the strength of a rough demo tape or gig to hear what they could do, and for many of the bands it was their first experience of a professional recording studio, not to mention a much-needed boost to their finances.  The format became standardised as a single session in the studio with a staff producer and engineer (or more latterly a producer-engineer and assistant), during which the artists would record four songs, but there were also some sessions which were either live to air, or pre-recorded as live with an audience.  Other Radio 1 programmes and DJs adopted a similar system of Maida Vale sessions, such as Janice Long, Andy Kershaw, and The Evening Session (whose current host, Zane Lowe, has nicknamed the studio 'Maida Vegas'), as well as the more direct inheritors of the Peel Sessions tradition, Huw Stevens, Rob da Bank and Mike Davies."]}, {"page": "The King Blues", "response": ["\"My Boulder\" was released as a single on 13 October 2008 in the UK.
