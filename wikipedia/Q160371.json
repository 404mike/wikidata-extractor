As it was unusual for solo flute to be featured widely in orchestral concerts, this was not easily done in the immediate years after World War II; however, Rampal's flair and presence\u2014he was a big man to wield such a slim instrument\u2014paved the way for the next generation of flautist superstars such as James Galway and Emmanuel Pahud.", "Following the foundation of the Nice Summer Academy in 1959, Rampal held classes there annually until 1977. In 1969 he succeeded Gaston Crunelle as flute professor at the Paris Conservatoire, a position he held until 1981. When 21-year-old James Galway sought Rampal out in Paris in the early 1960s, Galway felt that he was going to meet \"the master\". As Galway says in his own autobiography, \"For me, of course, it was simply a sensation to meet this great musician; like a fiddler meeting Heifetz.\"", "James Galway, Rampal's globally known successor as \"The Man with the Golden Flute\", dedicated performances to him and recalled elsewhere how as a teenager he had been captivated by the sound of Rampal's \"fluid technique\" and \"the beauty of his tone\". For a young musician in the 1960s, he said, listening to Rampal's recordings \"was a step into the stars as far as flute playing was concerned.\" He recalled also the generous encouragement Rampal gave him following their meetings in Paris. Of the passing of his \"hero\", Galway added: \"He was the first major influence in my life and I am still grateful for everything he ever did for me. He was a great influence on the flute world and the musical world in general, bringing to ordinary folk through his music making a charm which enhanced their everyday lives.\""]}, {"page": "Guildhall School of Music and Drama", "response": ["Based within the Barbican Centre in the City of London, the school currently numbers just over 1000 students, approximately 800 of whom are music students and 200 on the drama and technical theatre programmes.
