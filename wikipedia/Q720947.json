In the following season, City challenged for the title but ultimately lost out to Derby County and finished fourth in the league. Bell scored thirteen goals that season. In the 1972\u201373 season, City finished eleventh in the league. In the 1973\u201374 season, Bell helped City reach the 1974 Football League Cup Final, in which he scored in a 2\u20131 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Bell played for City in a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester United in the final game of the season. Denis Law scored the only goal in the game which confirmed United's relegation from the First Division. In the 1974\u201375 season, Bell scored fifteen league goals. He was named in the 1974\u201375 Football League First Division PFA Team of the Year. In November 1975, at the age of 29, Bell severely injured his right knee against Manchester United in a challenge with Martin Buchan during a League Cup match at Maine Road. City went on to win the League Cup that season, defeating Newcastle 2\u20131 in the 1976 Football League Cup Final. Bell's prolonged absence due to his injury was a blow to Don Revie, who quit as manager of England in 1977. Bell returned to action in a 4\u20130 victory against Newcastle on Boxing Day in 1977. His introduction to the game, at half time, was greeted with rapturous applause. However, Bell's return to City was fleeting as he left City in the 1978\u201379 season; Malcolm Allison, who returned to City for a second spell as manager in 1979, convinced Bell that it was time to go. The then-chairman Peter Swales described Bell as the \"finest tuned athlete\" and \"irreplaceable\". This latter sentiment turned out to be true as Allison was not able to find a trio of talented players of the calibre of Bell, Summerbee and Lee as he had done in the past with Joe Mercer. Bell tried to resurrect his career in 1980 with NASL side San Jose Earthquakes, where he joined former Manchester United player George Best. However, Bell ended up playing only five games for the club before retiring from football altogether."]}, {"page": "Robert Gordon's College", "response": ["*Martin Buchan, former footballer and captain with Manchester United, Aberdeen and Scotland"]}]}}
