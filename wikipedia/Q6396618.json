Tom Johnston had retired, due to old age and losing the respect of the playing faithful. Buxton set about revitalising the club, he demanded respect from the players and brought in harder training sessions which were taken by himself and John Haselden who had been promoted to Assistant Manager as well as taking over Physio duties. He signed Ian Robins, Peter Fletcher and off-loaded players such as Kevin Johnson, Terry Gray and Bobby Campbell. The 1979\u201380 season proved to be the start of the revolution under Buxton where Town won the 4th Division Championship and scored 101 goals in the process. Buxton also won the Bell's Manager of the Year award for the Fourth Division. The following season Buxton set the club's then-record transfer fee of \u00a3110,000 for Terry Austin, but it was his first signing, Ian Robins, together with earlier acquisitions, Steve Kindon and Brian Stanton, who set the club alight, scoring a combined total of 41 goals as Town finished just outside the promotion places."]}]}}
