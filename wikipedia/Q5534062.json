He was chairman of St Johnstone from 1986 until November 2011.\nIn 1970, Brown founded G. S. Brown Construction, which specialises in homebuilding. Brown is still chairman of the company, which is a family business, with two of his sons also on the board of directors. In June 2011, it was revealed that the company was set to become the shirt sponsors of the club, to mark Brown's quarter-century as chairman.Brown took control of St Johnstone in 1986, when they were in deep financial trouble and near the bottom of the Scottish Football League. A rights issue raised \u00a3150,000, which solved the club's short-term financial problems.Alex Totten was soon appointed as manager. Under his guidance, the club made a rise from second-bottom in the Scottish Second Division in 1986 to mid-table in the Scottish Premier Division in late 1990. During this period, Brown oversaw the sale of Muirton Park to Asda and the club's move to a newly built McDiarmid Park stadium in the Tulloch area of the city, which was opened in 1989.\nIn August 2006, to mark Brown's twentieth anniversary as chairman of St Johnstone, the Perthshire Advertiser published his best-of-Saints XI from the past two decades:\n\nAlan Main\nMark Treanor\nCallum Davidson\nTommy Turner\nSergei Baltacha\nAlan Kernaghan\nAllan Moore\nJohn O'Neil\nRoddy Grant\nPaul Wright\nHarry CurranAs Steve Lomas was presented to the media as the new St Johnstone manager in November 2011, Brown announced that he was going to pass control of the club to his son Steven.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Johnstone F.C.", "response": ["It took Saints until 1983 to return to the top flight \u2013 albeit for a single season\u00a0\u2013 before setting a record through suffering two successive relegations in 1984 and 1985.

His son, Steve, was handed control of the club. In June 2013 Steve Lomas left the club to manage Millwall and Tommy Wright was appointed as his replacement. In his first competitive game in charge, Wright lead St Johnstone to a 1\u20130 victory against Rosenborg BK in Norway.
