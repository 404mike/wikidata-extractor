Much of the funds came from donations by the Chancellor, Lord Iveagh, and Frederick Purser, a senior fellow, as well as almost all of the fees paid by female Oxford and Cambridge students (the so-called steamboat ladies) for conferral of University of Dublin degrees under the system of ad eundem gradum recognition that exists between the three universities (Oxford and Cambridge not permitting female students to receive degrees for their study at the time). The site was extended in 1910 with the donation of the adjacent Palmerston House and its grounds by John Griffith, who renamed it Purser House in memory of the then-deceased Purser, a relative of his."]}]}}
