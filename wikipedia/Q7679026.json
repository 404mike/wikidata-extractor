The 1st Division was made up of the 1st Infantry Brigade under Colonel Henry MacLaurin, an Australian-born officer with previous part-time military service; the 2nd, under Colonel James Whiteside McCay, an Irish-born Australian politician and former Minister for Defence; and the 3rd, under Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, a British regular officer seconded to the Australian Army before the war. The 1st Light Horse Brigade was commanded by Colonel Harry Chauvel, an Australian regular, while the divisional artillery was commanded by Colonel Talbot Hobbs. The initial response for recruits was so good that in September 1914 the decision was made to raise the 4th Infantry Brigade and 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades. The 4th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Colonel John Monash, a prominent Melbourne civil engineer and businessman. The AIF continued to grow through the war, eventually numbering five infantry divisions, two mounted divisions and a mixture of other units. As the AIF operated within the British war effort, its units were generally organised along the same lines as comparable British Army formations. However, there were often small differences between the structures of British and Australian units, especially in regards to the AIF infantry divisions' support units."]}, {"page": "Harold Walker (British Army officer)", "response": ["Walker was initially replaced by Brigadier-General Talbot Hobbs until he too fell sick, and then by Brigadier-General Harry Chauvel."]}, {"page": "Talbot (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Talbot Hobbs (1864\u20131938), Australian architect"]}, {"page": "York, Western Australia", "response": ["The Western Australian Bank building, designed by JJ Talbot Hobbs and the Masonic Hall (designed by James William Wright), are in Victorian Academic Classical style."]}, {"page": "Kings Park, Western Australia", "response": ["The Cenotaph was unveiled in the year of the Centenary of Western Australia \u2013 on 24 November 1929 by the Governor Sir William Campion, and had as the honorary architect General Sir J.
