Sammy Woods wrote that Hewett, along with Charles Wreford-Brown and George Ricketts, became very seasick on the journey there.Woods (1925), p. 45. The first two matches were first-class fixtures against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. Hewett scored 30 and 49 in the first, an eight wicket loss which Woods blamed on taking place too soon after their arrival, claiming the team \"had hardly found our land-legs.\" The first match had yielded an aggregate of 861 runs, the second contained only 352, of which Hewett scored 10 and 29. His captain, Lord Hawke, was the only other batsman to reach double figures in both innings as the touring side won by four wickets. None of the remaining fixtures on the tour had first-class status, and not all were eleven-a-side contests. Hewett scored 113 against the sixteen man All New York on Staten Island, a match in which he was standing in as captain due to Lord Hawke being ill.Woods (1925), p. 46. Woods rated Hewett, along with Lord Hawke and Brown, as the best batsmen on the tour.Woods (1925), p. 47."]}, {"page": "Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in North America in 1891\u201392", "response": ["| George Ricketts || \u2013 ||  || Right-handed || Right arm medium || ", "The party left Liverpool on 16 September 1891, and during the voyage Herbie Hewett, George Ricketts and Charles Wreford-Brown suffered badly from seasickness.  Sammy Woods, who was not affected by such ailments, attempted to get the three men to take dinner with him on the fourth evening.  He served champagne and vegetable soup, but an American who was also suffering from nausea commented \"Say steward, did you bring this up or did I?\"  None of Woods' three team-mates ate the dinner.Woods (1925), p45.
