The club were hit by financial troubles after being told they had to pay fines totalling \u00a3250,000, and at one point were at risk of being wound up. As a result, Horton was forced to cope without assistant John Askey, after Askey was dismissed to cut costs. The sale of top-scorer Jon Parkin also robbed Horton of his best player. Following a poor start to the season he placed four players on the transfer-list. He also placed Kevin Townson on the transfer-list, before sacking the striker after Townson displayed \"serious misconduct\". Throughout the campaign, Horton signed goalkeeper Tommy Lee, striker Clyde Wijnhard, midfielder Alan Navarro, forward Allan Russell, and striker Matty McNeil. The \"Silkmen\" finished in 17th-place, five points above the relegation zone. Horton prepared for the 2006\u201307 campaign by searching for a new midfield player, and found one in Shrewsbury Town's Jamie Tolley. He also signed versatile attacker Colin Heath, defender Carl Regan, and former Port Vale goalkeeper Jonny Brain; whilst releasing five players. Horton was sacked in October 2006, after his team failed to win any of their opening twelve league games, leaving them bottom of the Football League."]}, {"page": "Stephen Grindlay", "response": ["Grindlay was snapped up by Ayr United boss Brian Reid after his release from Queen of the South.

Simon Mensing converted a penalty to put Hamilton 1\u20130 up, and Richard Offiong completed the scoring. However, Offiong was later sent off following two bookable offences. On Tuesday 13th, Aberdeen traveled to Ayr, to play December's postponement against Kilmarnock. Killie took the lead when the ball fell nicely to Allan Russell who finished well. Aberdeen equalised on the half-hour, when Lee Miller met Mulgrew's corner fantastically, scoring with a back-heel volley. And it was Miller who grabbed the winner, when he met Mackie's cross with a diving header. Aberdeen won the game 2\u20131 and that moved Aberdeen up to fourth. Aberdeen were to host both sides of the Old Firm in the space of two weeks, up first were Celtic, a team who Aberdeen have never beaten at Pittodrie since 2002. The game turned out to be a classic. Stuart Duff crossed the ball for Gary McDonald to open the scoring with a looping header. Celtic were back on level terms within a minute, as a cut-back by Aiden McGeady found Scott Brown unmarked to score the equaliser. Duff then got on the score-sheet himself, with a well taken volley. After immense pressure from Celtic in the second half, Scott McDonald pulled Celtic back on level terms again when he headed in Barry Robson's cross. However, Aberdeen were not to be denied the win, as Zander Diamond headed in two Charlie Mulgrew free-kicks in the space of two minutes to give the Dons' a 4\u20132 win against the reigning champions. The crowd were left chanting for five. The following week, a packed Pittodrie watched Aberdeen take on the second half of the Old Firm, Rangers. A dull game saw very little chances until in the 80th minute Nacho Novo found space at the back post, but his shot rebounded off of the post. Darren Mackie and Charlie Mulgrew went close for Aberdeen, but both defences stayed firm as the sides settled for a 0\u20130 draw. Aberdeen then travelled to Falkirk. Once again a dull away performance saw Michael Higdon score the only goal as the Bairns' won 1\u20130."]}, {"page": "Manuel Pascali", "response": ["He initially joined Kilmarnock on trial in July 2008 with a view to a one-year loan deal.Killie trial for Parma man, Sky Sports, 25 July 2008.
