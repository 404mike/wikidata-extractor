Towards the end of the 19th century the tree was badly burned in a fire originating from a group of schoolgirls boiling a kettle within the hollow.  It was again damaged by a fire set by picnickers in 1913.  In the same year, it was mentioned in a book of Robert Murray Gilchrist who described the tree as \"an old, old man who will be brave to the end\".
