He represented England at youth level, from the under-17s to the under-21s, and also played for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nHe started his career with Bristol Rovers, before moving to Chelsea, from where he spent periods on loan at Plymouth Argyle, Queens Park Rangers, Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace, Birmingham City and Wigan Athletic. In 2010 he signed for Swansea City and in 2012 for Manchester City, who loaned him to West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa. He joined Villa on a permanent contract in 2015, and moved on to Celtic in August 2016. In his first season with Celtic he won both the PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year and SFWA Footballer of the Year awards, and he stayed with the club for a further two-and-a-half seasons before returning to England with Preston North End.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 25", "response": ["*  1989   \u2013 Scott Sinclair, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Bristol Rovers F.C.", "response": ["The Bristol Rovers Academy currently operates at The City Academy Bristol and Sir Bernard Lovell School.

In May 2021, U16s player Kyrie Pierre joined Aston Villa for an undisclosed six-figure fee, a record fee received by the Academy for a player.  Perhaps the most successful former member of the academy is Scott Sinclair, who was signed by Chelsea in 2005 for \u00a3200,000, with further payments to the club possible, depending on performance. He currently plays for Championship club Preston North End. Other former Academy players currently contracted to teams in the Premier League or English Football League include Ryan Broom (Plymouth Argyle), Ellis Harrison (Fleetwood Town), Chris Lines (Stevenage), Tom Lockyer (Luton Town), Matt Macey (Hibernian) and Ollie Clarke (Mansfield Town)."]}, {"page": "Swansea City A.F.C.", "response": ["Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers took charge for the 2010\u201311 season.

Chelsea left Ballack out of their Champions League squad for the 2007\u201308 group stage as they realised that his injury would prevent him from playing any useful part and preferred to select the fully fit Steve Sidwell. The German international had an ankle operation in the summer and Chelsea could not take the risk of him not regaining full fitness before the end of the group stage. Thus, Ballack could not play in the Champions League before the knockout stages began in February. The club was only able to select 23 out of a possible 25 players for their Champions League squad due to the new UEFA regulations on \"association-trained players\" and \"club-trained players\". Due to this regulation, Chelsea were also unable to select young player Scott Sinclair and could only pick 23 players as their only \"club-trained player\" was John Terry. For this reason, it was deemed unwise to gamble on Ballack being fit at some point."]}, {"page": "Fuel for the Hate Game", "response": ["Fuel for the Hate Game is the first full-length album by Hot Water Music.
