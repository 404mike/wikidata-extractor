Modern depictions of him are often heavily influenced by Malory, though characterizations are inconsistent. Alfred Tennyson adapted episodes from Malory to present Gawain as a worldly and faithless knight in his Idylls of the King (1859-1885).Taylor & Brewer, pp. 107\u201308.Whiting, pp. 193\u201394 Similarly, T. H. White's novel The Once and Future King (1958) follows Malory, but presents Gawain as more churlish than Malory's torn and tragic portrayal.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 186\u201387. In contrast, Thomas Berger's Arthur Rex (1978) portrays Gawaine as open-minded and introspective about his flaws, qualities that make him the Round Table's greatest knight.Dentzien, pp. 219\u201321. Though he usually plays a supporting role, some works feature Gawain as the main character. Vera Chapman's The Green Knight (1975) and Anne Crompton's Gawain and Lady Green (1997) offer modern retellings of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.Mediavilla, pp. 65\u201367. Gwalchmei is the protagonist in Gillian Bradshaw's Celtic-tinged Hawk of May (1980) and its sequels.Mediavilla, pp. 64\u201365. Gawain is a major character in The Squire's Tales (1998-2010) by Gerald Morris, in which he is portrayed as a skilled knight, immensely loyal to Arthur, and as intelligent, kind-hearted, and occasionally sarcastic. Morris includes many legends involving Gawain, with the second book, The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady, drawing heavily from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. An aged Gawain is one of the central characters in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Buried Giant (2015)."]}, {"page": "Gareth", "response": ["* Vera Chapman's novel The King's Damosel (1976) gives a complete version of Lynette's life."]}, {"page": "Bladud", "response": ["Vera Chapman's Blaedud the Birdman is a fantasy novel about the character.Baird Searles, Beth Meacham and Michael Franklin.
