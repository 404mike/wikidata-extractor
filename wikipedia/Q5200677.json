On the evening of 7 May near Douai, he led a flight of 5 Albatros D.III's from Jasta 11 that encountered 11 S.E.5s from the \"elite\" No. 56 Squadron RFC, including the top English ace of the time, Captain Albert Ball, as well as a SPAD S.VII from No. 19 Squadron, and a Sopwith Triplane of No 8 (Naval) Squadron. In a running battle in deteriorating visibility in the middle of a thunderstorm over Bourlon Wood, both sides became scattered. Richthofen engaged in single combat with the British Triplane. At about the same time, Ball was seen by fellow 56 Squadron pilot Cyril Crowe chasing a red Albatros into a thundercloud. Ball lost control of his plane and crashed fatally. Though forced to land his damaged aircraft, Richthofen escaped injury. The British Sopwith Triplane involved in the action returned to base undamaged."]}, {"page": "Albert Ball", "response": ["On the evening of 7 May 1917, near Douai, 11 British aircraft from No.\u00a056 Squadron led by Ball in an S.E.5 encountered German fighters from Jasta\u00a011. A running dogfight in deteriorating visibility resulted, and the aircraft became scattered.  Cecil Arthur Lewis, a participant in this fight, described it in his memoir Sagittarius Rising. Ball was last seen by fellow pilots pursuing the red Albatros D.III of the Red Baron's younger brother, Lothar von Richthofen, who eventually landed near Ann\u0153ullin with a punctured fuel tank. Cyril Crowe observed Ball flying into a dark thundercloud. A German pilot officer on the ground, Lieutenant Hailer, then saw Ball's plane falling upside-down from the bottom of the cloud, at an altitude of , with a dead prop."]}, {"page": "No. 56 Squadron RAF", "response": ["Cyril Crowe,"]}, {"page": "Gerald Maxwell", "response": ["His confirmed 26 victories consisted of 12 enemy aircraft destroyed (including two shared wins), and 14 \"out of control\" victories, six of which were shared.
