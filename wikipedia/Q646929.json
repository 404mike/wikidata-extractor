Born in Glasgow to Italian parents, Iannucci studied at the University of Glasgow followed by the University of Oxford. Starting on BBC Scotland and BBC Radio 4, his early work with Chris Morris on the radio series On the Hour transferred to television as The Day Today. A character from this series, Alan Partridge, co-created by Iannucci, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci's television and radio programmes, including Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge and I'm Alan Partridge. Iannucci also fronted the satirical Armistice review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, The Armando Iannucci Shows, for Channel 4.Moving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom The Thick of It and the spoof documentary Time Trumpet in 2006. Winning funding from the UK Film Council, in 2009 he directed a critically acclaimed feature film, In the Loop, featuring characters from The Thick of It. As a result of these works, he has been described by The Daily Telegraph as \"the hardman of political satire\". Other works during this period include an operetta libretto, Skin Deep, and his radio series Charm Offensive. Iannucci created the HBO political satire Veep, and was its showrunner for four seasons from 2012 to 2015. For his work on Veep he won two Emmys in 2015, Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. He followed this with the feature films The Death of Stalin in 2017 and The Personal History of David Copperfield, a 2019 adaptation of the novel David Copperfield. In 2020, he created the comedy series Avenue 5 on HBO.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Morris (satirist)", "response": ["In the early 1990s, Morris teamed up with his radio producer Armando Iannucci to create On the Hour, a satire of news programmes. This was expanded into a television spin off, The Day Today, which launched the career of comedian Steve Coogan and has since been hailed as one of the most important satirical shows of the 1990s. Morris further developed the satirical news format with Brass Eye, which lampooned celebrities whilst focusing on themes such as crime and drugs. For many, the apotheosis of Morris' career was a Brass Eye special, which dealt with the moral panic surrounding paedophilia. It quickly became one of the most complained-about programmes in British television history, leading the Daily Mail to describe him as \"the most loathed man on TV\".", "In 1991, Morris joined Armando Iannucci's spoof news project On the Hour. Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, it saw him work alongside Iannucci, Steve Coogan, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring and Rebecca Front. In 1992, Morris hosted Danny Baker's Radio 5 Morning Edition show for a week whilst Baker was on holiday. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the Chris Morris Music Show, on BBC Radio 1 alongside Peter Baynham and 'man with a mobile phone' Paul Garner. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his Brass Eye programme. In the same year, Morris teamed up with Peter Cook (as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling), in a series of improvised conversations for BBC Radio 3 entitled Why Bother?.", "Morris served as script editor for the 2009 series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, working with former colleagues Stewart Lee, Kevin Eldon and Armando Iannucci. He maintained this role for the second (2011) and third series (2014), also appearing as a mock interviewer dubbed the \"hostile interrogator\" in the third and fourth series.", "In 2012, Morris directed the seventh and penultimate episode of the first season of Veep, an Armando Iannucci-devised American version of The Thick of It. In 2013, he returned to direct two episodes for the second season of Veep, and a further episode for season three in 2014.", "In February 2014, Morris made a surprise appearance at the beginning of a Stewart Lee live show, introducing the comedian with fictional anecdotes about their work together. The following month, Morris appeared in the third series of Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle as a \"hostile interrogator\", a role previously occupied by Armando Iannucci.", "In November 2014, a three-hour retrospective of Morris' radio career was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra under the title 'Raw Meat Radio', presented by Mary Anne Hobbs and featuring interviews with Armando Iannucci, Peter Baynham, Paul Garner, and others."]}, {"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Armando Iannucci (born 1963)"]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Armando Iannucci (born 1963)"]}, {"page": "November 28", "response": ["*1963 \u2013 Armando Iannucci, Scottish comedian, actor, director, and producer"]}, {"page": "University of Glasgow", "response": ["In more recent times, the university was the focus of the \"Glasgow Group\" of poets and literary critics, including Philip Hobsbaum, Tom Leonard and Alasdair Gray.

Although Lynn comments that the word \"spin\" has \"probably entered the political vocabulary since the series,\" Iannucci suggests that the show \"taught us how to unpick the verbal tricks that politicians think they can get away with in front of the cameras.\" The series depicted the media-consciousness of politicians, reflecting the public relations training they undergo to help them deal with interviews and reading from autocue effectively. This is particularly evident in the episode \"The Ministerial Broadcast\", in which Hacker is advised on the effects of his clothes and surroundings. The episode \"A Conflict of Interest\" humorously lampoons the various political stances of Britain's newspapers through their readers (although this material was not original):There are various versions of the \"Times is read by the people who run the country\" patter, which has been attributed to an anonymous advertising copywriter: see, for example, J. M. & M.J. Cohen, The Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Quotations (revised ed. 1995), 3:31.

Critics, such as Andrew Davies in the Times Educational Supplement and Armando Iannucci, have noted that the show had high expectations of its audience. Lynn posits that the public are more intelligent than most situation comedies, often patronizingly, give them credit for. Jay believes that the viewers were just as intelligent as the writers, but that there were some things that they needed to know but didn't.", "In 2005, BBC Four launched The Thick of It, described by director Armando Iannucci as \"Yes Minister meets Larry Sanders, and The Daily Telegraph called it \"a Yes, Minister for the Labour years.\" The style shows many identifiable hallmarks of Yes Minister, namely the blundering politician virtually entirely dependent on those whose presentational and political nous greatly eclipse his own limited abilities.", "As an adaption of The Thick of It, Armando Iannucci also created and directed Veep, an American political satire comedy television series. As the United States has a different political system from United Kingdom's parliamentary system, the show instead focuses on a fictional female Vice President of the United States and her staff. Both Yes, Minister and Veep feature a Prime Minister/President that is never depicted on-screen, but nevertheless highly influential in the plot; and in both series, the unseen Prime Minister/President eventually resigns, resulted in both protagonists later becoming the Prime Minister/President themselves."]}, {"page": "Seattle International Film Festival", "response": ["|In the Loop (dir.

Shandling's performance is a precursor to Larry David's in Curb Your Enthusiasm and Ricky Gervais (The Office, Extras) as David Brent. Gervais said in Variety that he was heavily influenced by the show and that \"It taught me that flawed characters can be compulsive viewing\u00a0\u2013 seeing them squirm and get their comeuppance.\" Armando Iannucci said that his political satire The Thick of It strove to mix comedy and authenticity in a similar manner to The Larry Sanders Show."]}, {"page": "Wilkins Micawber", "response": ["The character was played by W.C.

He is portrayed by Steve Coogan, who had performed a similar character for a BBC college radio station at university. Producer Armando Iannucci asked Coogan to do a voice for a generic sports reporter, with elements of Elton Welsby, Jim Rosenthal and John Motson. According to Iannucci, \"Someone said, 'He's an Alan!' and someone else said, 'He's a Partridge!' Within minutes we knew where he lived, we'd worked out his back story, what his aspirations were.\" His name was also inspired by the former Newsbeat presenter Frank Partridge.
