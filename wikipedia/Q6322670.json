In 1992, the second album The Oneness of Two Minds in Unison was released, however the band split up and K-Gee returned to being a DJ.\nIn May 1996, K-Gee met Melanie Blatt and Shaznay Lewis who were formerly in All Saints 1.9.7.5., and wanted to relaunch their group with their new-found bandmembers Natalie and Nicole Appleton. Together they recorded \"I Know Where It's At\" and after All Saints managed to land a recording contract, he co-wrote and produced their first album, All Saints. The album turned out to be successful and scored three consecutive number 1 hits in the United Kingdom. K-Gee accompanied them on their tour and was widely regarded as their fifth member.\nThe success allowed K-Gee to do production and songwriting for other bands as well. K-Gee has worked with TQ, Carl Thomas, Gabrielle, Rod Stewart, Hinda Hicks, Noreaga, George Michael, Pras, Glamma Kid, Jamie Cullum, Jessie J and Esm\u00e9e Denters.\nK-Gee signed to independent record label Instant Karma in 2000.

Together with his school friend Bello B, K-Gee used to rap over beats and basslines and record their efforts onto tape. The duo called themselves the Outlaw Posse, and the tapes they recorded came to the attention of DJ Richie Rich, who was making his name as both a club DJ and a recording artist in his own right. He was also the owner of Gee Street Records, and was impressed enough with the group to offer them some time in a recording studio.

The name did not last until the end of the year, and by the release of their final album the name had changed again to Brothers Like Outlaw. The album was well received amongst the fans and the music press, but the dissatisfaction with their name echoed the group's growing dissatisfaction with each other - their final album's title The Oneness of Two Minds In Unison (Gee Street, 1992) clearly intended to be ironic. Citing musical differences, the group split and went their separate ways in 1992 - although more recently K-Gee has stated that the group were actually recording a third album and split because of Gee Street's delays in putting out new material.", "K-Gee went on to gain respect as a bootleg remixer, which eventually led to more official work coming his way.

Bello B went on to have a career as a solo artist, guesting on tracks by artists such as Dodge City Productions and rapping on The KLF's hit single \"America: What Time Is Love?\" (KLF Communications, 1992).
