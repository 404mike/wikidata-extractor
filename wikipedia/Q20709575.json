Although particularly known for her roles in the operas of Handel and Mozart, she sang a wide repertoire during her career including Violetta in La traviata and all three of the leading female roles in The Tales of Hoffmann (Olympia, Antonia, and Giulietta).Mannion was born in Liverpool and studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music before making her operatic debut in 1984 as Adina in L'elisir d'amore with Scottish Opera. Her singing career was cut short by illness in 1998, and she now teaches singing privately and as a member of the teaching staff at Bath Spa University and London's Royal College of Music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pagliacci", "response": ["In 1907, Pagliacci became the first opera to be recorded in its entirety, with the Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli as Canio and under Leoncavallo's personal supervision. In 1931, it became the first complete opera to be filmed with sound, in a now-obscure version starring the tenor Fernando Bertini as Canio, in his only film, with the San Carlo Opera Company. Franco Zeffirelli directed his 1981 La Scala production with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Teresa Stratas for a 1982 television airing, which has since been released on DVD. The movie's soundtrack received a Grammy nomination for Best Opera Recording. Pagliacci was also recorded in English in 1997, and released commercially in 1998, for the Chandos \"Opera in English\" label with Dennis O'Neill as Canio, Alan Opie as Tonio, and Rosa Mannion as Nedda.Gramophone. \"Leoncavallo: Pagliacci (in English)\".
