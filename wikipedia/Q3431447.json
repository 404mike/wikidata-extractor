Discovery during the Discovery Expedition of 1901\u20131904, known by the nickname Muggins. He pursued his interest in marine biology initially in his spare time, but eventually found work at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. He worked on the collections from the Southern Cross Expedition, before joining the Discovery expedition as one of its oldest members, at 37. The post of naturalist had previously been offered to William Speirs Bruce, who declined, preferring to travel on the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Hodgson's work on the Discovery provided the first descriptions of deep sea floor communities in the Antarctic.Hodgson was reappointed curator of the Plymouth Museum on his return and went on to study the collections from the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902\u20131904. He died in May 1926.The National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association hold some of Hodgson's scientific notes in the MBA Archive Collection.Cape Hodgson, the northernmost point of Black Island in the Ross Archipelago is named after Thomas Hodgson.Hodgson was a fellow of the Anthropological Institute.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Discovery Expedition", "response": ["The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist. The geologist, Hartley Ferrar, was a 22-year-old recent Cambridge graduate who Markham thought \"might be made into a man.\" Marine biologist Thomas Vere Hodgson, from Plymouth Museum, was a more mature figure, as was the senior of the two doctors, Reginald Koettlitz, who, at 39, was the oldest member of the expedition. He, like Armitage, had been with the Jackson\u2013Harmsworth expedition. The junior doctor and zoologist was Edward Wilson, who became close to Scott and provided the qualities of calmness, patience and detachment that the captain reportedly lacked."]}, {"page": "Black Island (Ross Archipelago)", "response": ["Black Island (), in the Ross Archipelago, is immediately west of White Island. It was first named by the Discovery Expedition (1901\u201304) because of its lack of snow. The island's northernmost point is named Cape Hodgson, commemorating Thomas Vere Hodgson, one of the oldest members of the Discovery Expedition."]}, {"page": "Euphausia crystallorophias", "response": ["Euphausia crystallorophias is a species of krill, sometimes called ice krill, crystal krill, or Antarctic coastal krill. It lives in the coastal waters around Antarctica, further south than any other species of krill. The specimens for the species' original description were collected through holes cut in the ice by Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition, several thousand having been donated by Thomas Vere Hodgson."]}, {"page": "Thomas V.
