With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public.  He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector.  Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.\nFuller was highly controversial in British politics because of his support for the organised fascist movement.  He was also an occultist and Thelemite who wrote a number of works on esotericism and mysticism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.

He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley's Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back, an old friend of Crowley's who was both a practicing surgeon and an enthusiast of literature. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of \u00a3100 for the best essay on his work.

The American historian Wesley Moody has argued that these English commentators tended to filter Sherman's actions and his hard-war strategy through their own ideas about modern warfare, thereby contributing to the exaggeration of his \"atrocities\" and unintentionally feeding into the negative assessment of Sherman's moral character associated with the \"Lost Cause\" school of US Southern historiography.Wesley Moody, Demon of the Lost Cause: Sherman and Civil War History (University of Missouri Press, 2011)  This led to the publication of several works, notably John B. Walters's Merchant of Terror: General Sherman and Total War (1973), which presented Sherman as responsible for \"a mode of warfare which transgressed all ethical rules and showed an utter disregard for human rights and dignity.\"Walters, p. 82  Following Walters, James Reston Jr. argued in 1984 that Sherman had planted the \"seed for the Agent Orange and Agent Blue programs of food deprivation in Vietnam\".Quoted in Holden Reid, p. 500  More recently, historians such as Brian Holden-Reid have challenged such readings of Sherman's record and of his contributions to modern warfare.See, e.g., Holden Reid, pp. 499\u2013507"]}, {"page": "Military tactics", "response": ["The development of tactics has involved a shifting balance between the four tactical functions since ancient times, and changes in firepower and mobility have been fundamental to these changes. Various models have been proposed to explain the interaction between the tactical functions and the dominance of individual fighting arms during different periods. J. F. C. Fuller proposed three \"tactical cycles\" in each of the classical and Christian eras. For the latter epoch, he proposed a \"shock\" cycle between 650 and 1450, a \"shock and projectile\" cycle 1450\u20131850, and a \"projectile\" cycle from 1850, with respect to the Western and North American warfare.

Fuller, architect of the first great tank battle at Cambrai, and his contemporary, B. H.

In Germany, study groups were set up by Hans von Seeckt, commander of the Reichswehr Truppenamt, for 57 areas of strategy and tactics to learn from World War I and to adapt strategy to avoid the stalemate and then defeat they had suffered. All seem to have seen the strategic shock value of mobility and the new possibilities made possible by motorised forces. Both saw that the armoured fighting vehicle demonstrated firepower, mobility and protection. The Germans seem to have seen more clearly the need to make all branches of the Army as mobile as possible to maximise the results of this strategy. It would negate the static defences of the trench and machine gun and restore the strategic principles of manoeuvre and offense. Nevertheless, it was the British Army which was the only  one truly mechanised at the beginning of the Second World War, the Germans still relying on horse traction for a large portion of their artillery."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*J.

The town of Cambrai, in the d\u00e9partement of Nord, was an important supply centre for the German  (known to the British as the Hindenburg Line) and capture of the town and the nearby Bourlon Ridge would threaten the rear of the German line to the north. Major General Henry Tudor, Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA) of the 9th (Scottish) Division, advocated the use of new artillery-infantry tactics on his sector of the front. During preparations, J. F. C. Fuller, a staff officer with the Tank Corps, looked for places to use tanks for raids. General Julian Byng, commander of the Third Army, decided to combine both plans.

These were eagerly studied by the German army officer Heinz Guderian, who created the combination of Panzers and dive bombers that later proved so potent in Poland and France. The Ju 87 Stuka could be used as aerial artillery moving far ahead of the main forces with Panzers to smash enemy strong points without waiting for the horse-drawn artillery to catch up.

On 6 May 1915, Allenby voluntarily left the Cavalry Arm to take up command of V Corps which was engaged at that moment in severe fighting at the Second Battle of Ypres. Commanding a corps seemed to make Allenby's bad temper even worse where anything from a split infinitive in a staff paper to discovering a corpse in the field without the tin helmet that Allenby ordered his men to wear sent Allenby off into a rage. The V Corps was victorious in defeating the German assault but incurred controversially heavy losses in the process through Allenby's tactical policy of continual counter-attacks at the German attacking force. In September 1915, V Corps attempted a diversion of German strength to facilitate the concurrent British offensive at Loos. They executed a minor attack in the Hooge Sector in the Ypres Salient under Allenby's direction, which once again incurred substantial losses to its units involved in the affair.Gardner, pp. 66\u2013115 In October 1915, Allenby was promoted to lead the British Third Army, being made lieutenant-general (substantive rank) on 1 January 1916. In mid-Summer 1916, he was the Army Commander in support of the launch of the Battle of the Somme offensive, with responsibility for the abortive assault by 3rd Army troops on the trench fortress of the Gommecourt salient, which failed with severe casualties to the units under his command in the operation. By this time in 1916, Archibald Wavell who was one of Allenby's staff officers and supporters, wrote that Allenby's temper seemed to \"confirm the legend that 'the Bull' was merely a bad-tempered, obstinate hot-head, a 'thud-and-blunder' general\". Allenby harboured doubts about the leadership of the commander of the BEF, General Sir Douglas Haig, but refused to allow any of his officers to say anything critical about Haig.Urban, 2005 p. 220 However, despite Allenby's rages and obsession with applying the rules in a way that often seemed petty, Allenby's staff officers found an intellectually curious general who was interested in finding new ways of breaking the stalemate.Urban, 2005 p. 221 J.
