With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public.  He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector.  Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.\nFuller was highly controversial in British politics because of his support for the organised fascist movement.  He was also an occultist and Thelemite who wrote a number of works on esotericism and mysticism.", "link_mentions": {}}}
