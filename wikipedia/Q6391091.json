He contributed by recording \"Promised You a Miracle\" and appeared in the videos of \"Sweat in Bullet\" and \"Love Song\", from the Sons and Fascination album, which he did not appear on, but helped to promote.

His interest in New York music (including funk, hip-hop and dance) had an immediate effect on the band's musical development. He stayed long enough to drum on the band's next single, the disco-friendly \"Promised You a Miracle\" (based on a funk riff from one of the cassettes he played on the band's tour bus) which hit the UK Top 20 and the Australian Top 10.
