He joined them shortly after their formation in 1964 and remained with them until 1984, when he left amid creative friction with guitarist Dave Davies. He is the longest-serving member of the band, apart from the Davies brothers. He is also the most prolific member, again apart from the Davies brothers, who has played on twenty studio albums or nearly all of the band's creative output.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 15", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Mick Avory, English drummer "]}, {"page": "1944", "response": ["** Mick Avory, English musician (The Kinks)"]}, {"page": "The Who", "response": ["Moon further strengthened the reversal of traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals."]}, {"page": "Mick Jagger", "response": ["In their earliest days, the Rolling Stones played for no money in the interval of Alexis Korner's gigs at a basement club opposite London's Ealing Broadway tube station (subsequently called \"Ferry's\" club). The group had very little equipment and borrowed Korner's gear to play. The group's first appearance, under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite Muddy Waters tunes), was at the Marquee Club, a London jazz club, on 12\u00a0July 1962. They would later change their name to \"the Rolling Stones\" as it seemed more formal. Writer Victor Bockris says the band members included Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Ian Stewart on piano, Dick Taylor on bass and Tony Chapman on drums. However, Richards says in his memoir Life that \"The drummer that night was Mick Avory\u2013not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down...\" In June 1963, the band began a five month residency at Eel Pie Island Hotel, which the BBC later credited with shaping the band's career. By that autumn, Jagger had left the London School of Economics to pursue his promising musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group played songs by American rhythm and blues artists like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but strongly encouraged by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write songs. Their songwriting partnership took some time to develop; one of their early compositions was \"As Tears Go By\", a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting.  For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write \"The Last Time\", the group's third number one single in the UK (their first two UK number one hits being remakes of songs that had been recorded by other artists \"It's All Over Now\" by Bobby Womack and \"Little Red Rooster\" by Willie Dixon) based on \"This May Be the Last Time\", a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Jagger and Richards also wrote their first international hit, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". It established the Rolling Stones' image as defiant troublemakers in contrast to the Beatles as \"lovable moptop[s]\".left|thumb|alt=Portrait of Jagger holding a cigarette in his right hand looking directly at the camera |Jagger in 1965 Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: I wasn't trying to be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from suburbia who sings in this band, but someone older might have thought it was just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame."]}, {"page": "Brian Jones", "response": ["As Richards tells it, Jones came up with the name the \"Rollin' Stones\" (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner. \"The voice on the other end of the line obviously said, 'What are you called?' Panic! The Best of Muddy Waters album was lying on the floor\u2014and track five, side one was 'Rollin' Stone Blues'\". The Rollin' Stones played their first gig on 12 July 1962 at the Marquee Club in London, with a line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, bass player Dick Taylor (later of the Pretty Things) and drummer Tony Chapman.Some sources including Keith Richards erroneously list Mick Avory as the drummer at that gig, but Avory himself denies it.", "The four Rollin' Stones went searching for a bassist and drummer, finally settling on Bill Wyman on bass because he had a spare VOX AC30 guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes, as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself. After playing with Mick Avory, Tony Chapman and Carlo Little, in January 1963 they finally persuaded jazz-influenced Charlie Watts to join them. At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London; he had played with (among others) Alexis Korner's group Blues Incorporated."]}, {"page": "Kew", "response": ["*Mick Avory, musician and former drummer with The Kinks, lives in Kew."]}, {"page": "List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees", "response": ["| 75px|left to right: Pete Quaife, Dave Davies, Ray Davies, Mick Avory.", "| Mick Avory, Dave Davies, Ray Davies, and Pete Quaife."]}, {"page": "1944 in music", "response": ["*February 15 \u2013 Mick Avory, drummer (The Kinks)"]}, {"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Mick Avory (The Kinks)"]}, {"page": "Dave Davies", "response": ["Davies founded the Kinks with Pete Quaife in 1963.

Some legendary on-stage fights erupted during this time as well. The most notorious incident was at the Capitol Theatre in Cardiff in May 1965, involving drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies. The fight broke out during the second number of the set, \"Beautiful Delilah\". It culminated with Davies insulting Avory and kicking over his drum set after finishing the first song, \"You Really Got Me\". Avory responded by knocking down Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious. He then fled from the scene and Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to the head.The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night, Day-By-Day Concerts, Recordings, etc., by Doug Hinman Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.", "The Kinks' popularity faltered in 1985, and soon their records ceased to chart altogether.
