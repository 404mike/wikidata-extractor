His elder half-brother Sir James Pender, 1st Baronet (from Sir John Pender's first marriage) was the first chairman of Eastman Kodak (UK). John was educated at Eton College and in 1878 joined his father's company. He joined the board in 1881 and became managing director in 1893 and also deputy chairman in 1896.\nIn June 1896 Guglielmo Marconi aged 22 applied for his first patent. The technological advances with electro-magnetic waves, that had no need for cables, that Marconi was to instigate would change the entire communications industry forever. In 1901 Eastern Telegraph and Anglo-American threatened Marconi with legal action in Newfoundland if Marconi was to continue to operate his wireless telegraphy, for the next two decades it was Cable versus Wireless. Denison-Pender and his colleagues initially saw no threat from the wireless technology as wireless was slow, had a lack of secrecy and was liable to be interrupted. In 1904 Denison-Pender and the board had conversations with Lee De Forest with a view to buying a percentage of his company but the Eastern Telegraph board declined to make the investment in the end.\nIn 1917, following the retirement of Sir John Barry, he became chairman and his son, John Denison-Pender, 1st Baron Pender, succeeded him as managing director. In 1934, Imperial and International Communications, formerly the Eastern Telegraph Company, became Cable & Wireless. The new name was designed to more clearly reflect the combined radio and cable services which it offered, without reference to the Empire.\nDenison-Pender was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for his services to communications in the South African War. In the 1920 civilian war honours he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) for similar services during the First World War, in which his company was not only responsible for the lion's share of Britain's submarine telegraph cables, but also successfully cut off Germany's communications with the rest of the world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Pender", "response": ["His eldest son James (b. 1841) Sir James Pender, 1st Baronet, who was MP. for Mid Northamptonshire in 1895\u20131900, was created a baronet in 1897; and his third son, John Denison-Pender (b. 1855), was created a K.C.M.G. in 1901, the year in which he was living at Footscray Place in Sidcup.", "Between 1879 and 1889 Pender's group added Africa to its list of cable routes through three companies, African Direct, a joint venture with Brazilian Submarine; West African, incorporated into Eastern Telegraph; and Eastern and South African. In 1892, following the expiration of the telegraph concession operated by Brazilian Submarine, that company and its main rival, Western and Brazilian, formed a new venture, the Pacific and European Telegraph Company, to renew the concession and link Brazil with Chile and Argentina. Having helped to arrange this operation, Pender became chairman of Brazilian Submarine in 1893, further reinforcing his position as the leading figure in the worldwide cable business. After John Pender died in 1896; his successor as chairman of Eastern Telegraph and Eastern Extension was Lord Tweeddale, while Pender's son John Denison-Pender, later Sir John, continued as managing director. The last stage in restructuring the set of companies Pender had been so instrumental in creating, came in 1899, when Brazilian Submarine, having absorbed two other London-based telegraph companies operating in South America, was renamed the Western Telegraph Company."]}, {"page": "John Denison-Pender, 1st Baron Pender", "response": ["Denison-Pender was the son of Sir John Denison-Pender and his wife Beatrice Katherine (n\u00e9e Ellison).
