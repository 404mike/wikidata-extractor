He came to national prominence in 1999 when he was one of Meath's best players as they won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship that year, scoring the decisive goal in that year's All-Ireland final. This was his second All Ireland senior medal as he was a substitute when Meath won the 1996 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. He also won three Leinster Senior Football Championship medals. Murphy won two GAA All Stars Awards. Murphy's best season was the 2001 championship where he put in a number of superb display's as Meath reached another All Ireland final. In that final he had to leave the field of play with a hand injury. In recent years his form has been not up to what it once was and he has failed to warrant a starting position. Ollie made his senior inter-county debut playing for London against Galway in the 1994 Connacht Senior Football Championship. It was his one and only appearance for the Exiles. Murphy's Benny father was also an inter-county player - he lined out for his native Fermanagh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of All Stars Awards winners (football)", "response": ["| LCF || 20px|border Ollie Murphy || Meath || 1", "| RCF || 20px|border Ollie Murphy || Meath || 2"]}, {"page": "Leinster Senior Football Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ollie Murphy", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ollie Murphy"]}, {"page": "2001 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship", "response": ["|Ollie Murphy", "|Ollie Murphy"]}, {"page": "Anthony Lynch (Gaelic footballer)", "response": ["Lynch first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork senior football team in the late 1990s.  He made his debut in the 1998\u201399 National Football League, a season which saw Cork reach the final of the competition.  Dublin provided the opposition at Cork's home venue, P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh.  A close game developed, however, Cork were never really troubled.  A 0\u201312 to 1\u20137 score line resulted in victory for 'the Rebels', and gave Lynch a National League winners' medal in his debut season.  Later that year he made his championship debut in the provincial series as Cork cruised to a Munster final showdown with arch-rivals Kerry.  The men from 'the Kingdom' were on the hunt for a fourth successive provincial title, while Cork were out for success for the first time since 1995.  Cork's victory on a score line of 2\u201310 to 2\u20134 was unexpected as Lynch claimed his very first Munster winners' medal.  A subsequent defeat of Mayo saw Cork book their place in the All-Ireland final against Meath.  The pressure was on the Cork footballers to secure a rare double, particularly since their hurling counterparts had won the All-Ireland title a fortnight previously.  Ollie Murphy's first-half goal gave 'the Royals' a huge boost at half-time.  Immediately after the interval Trevor Giles missed a penalty while Joe Kavanagh responded with a goal which gave Cork a brief lead.  It was not enough as Lynch's side eventually lost the game by 1\u201311 to 1\u20138.
