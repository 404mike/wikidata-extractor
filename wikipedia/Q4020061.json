During his career, he made over 350 appearances in the Football League.He began his career as a youth player with Manchester United, making his professional debut at the age of sixteen.

Tom Marshall became the Wings\u2019 general manager. On November 23, 1979, with only a week to go before the opening game, Marshall ceased to be a part of the Wings organization. The Wings and Marshall disagreed on the details of the separation, but it was to be permanent. Ward Lawrence took over as general manager and Becker brought in Ray Denton to help run day-to-day operations. Mike Ivanow was to be the first signing, but the paperwork sent to his home misspelled his name. The delay resulted in Norman Piper becoming the first Wichita Wing. Piper was joined by the former Dallas Tornado and Liverpool player Kevin Kewley, who became the team's captain. Former Manchester United forward Jimmy Ryan and Argentinian phenom Omar Gomez anchored the team's offense. Roy Turner brought on George Ley as a player-coach. Later in the season, the team added former Manchester United winger Willie Anderson and forward Andy Chapman. Chapman had signed with Arsenal at age 16 and would become a fan favorite in Wichita, becoming the fifth leading scorer in Wings history. Ivanow would be joined in goal by Keith Van Eron. Though Ivanow had US Olympic experience, Van Eron would end up playing more time in goal."]}, {"page": "Willie Anderson", "response": ["Willie Anderson may refer to:", "* Willie Anderson (golfer) (1879\u20131910), Scottish golfer", "* Willie Anderson (rugby union, born 1955), rugby union coach and former Ireland international", "* Willie Anderson (rugby union, born 1967), Scotland rugby union player", "* Willie Anderson (American football) (born 1975), American football player", "* Willie Anderson (basketball) (born 1967), former professional basketball player and 1988 Olympic bronze medalist", "* Willie Anderson (footballer) (born 1947), former Portland Timbers NASL soccer player"]}, {"page": "Willie Anderson (American football)", "response": ["Anderson has a son, Jair Hawkins-Anderson, who played college football at Georgia Tech.Willie Anderson\u2019s expert take on Georgia Tech\u2019s transition", "He trains offensive linemen from high school to the NFL at the Willie Anderson Lineman Academy."]}, {"page": "1971 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|11|| Willie Anderson"]}, {"page": "Willie Anderson (soccer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Willie Anderson (footballer)"]}, {"page": "1965 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|FW ||12|| Willie Anderson || || "]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Willie Anderson"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Willie Anderson"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Willie Anderson"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["|FW ||12|| Willie Anderson || || "]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Football League Cup", "response": ["|11||Willie Anderson"]}]}}
