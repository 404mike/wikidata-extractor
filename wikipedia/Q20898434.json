Charnock's career lasted more than 30 years until his retirement in 1999 due to circulation problems, which later led to partial amputation of his right leg. He rode over 800 winners during his career, which took place mainly in the north of England, and due to his light weight he had particular success in handicap races. Amongst his major victories were two wins in the Cesarewitch Handicap, in 1995 and 1997. His only win in a group race came in his final season when Jemima won the Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse. Charnock died suddenly in August 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lowther Stakes", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Northumberland Plate", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Portland Handicap", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Great St. Wilfrid Stakes", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Weatherbys Super Sprint", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Cesarewitch Handicap", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock", "| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Windsor Castle Stakes", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Silver Bowl (horse race)", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Scarbrough Stakes", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Lindsay Charnock, 60, jockey."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2015", "response": ["*Lindsay Charnock, 60, British jockey.Lindsay Charnock, former leading northern jockey, dies aged 60"]}, {"page": "Hilary Needler Trophy", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Two-Year-Old Trophy", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Wentworth Stakes", "response": ["| Lindsay Charnock"]}, {"page": "Pipalong", "response": ["In October 1997 the yearling filly was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was sold for 7,000 guineas.
