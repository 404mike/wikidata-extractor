Gaining attention as a pioneer of the bootleg craze, Richard X has earned success as a producer and remixer. He has helmed hit singles for artists including Annie, Kelis, Liberty X, Rachel Stevens and Sugababes. According to an early issue of the now defunct Popworld magazine, Philips' alias comes from a postcard which was sealed with a kiss misinterpreted for the letter X.\nRichard X is known for his \"synthesised, grungy pop music\", which was inspired by bands such as The Human League and Kraftwerk. His original intention was to \"reinvent\" pop music by making records that are \"deliberately unplayable\". Referring to his 'Girls on Top' bootlegs, Richard X says, \"At the time it was inspired by anti the po-facedness of the electronica scene as much as anything. The production side, how it sounded \u2013 rough and spiky, electronic and modern \u2013 was what did it for me. Taking pop and putting it through a blender sound wise was the spirit of the times.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pet Shop Boys", "response": ["Pet Shop Boys began 2006 remixing Madonna's single \"Sorry\", for release in February.

In April, Pet Shop Boys released a new single that reached No.\u00a08 in the UK, \"I'm with Stupid\", a commentary on the relationship between George W. Bush and Tony Blair.

The ninth Pet Shop Boys studio album, Fundamental, followed in May, reaching a strong No.\u00a05 in their home country. The album was produced by Trevor Horn, who Pet Shop Boys had previously worked with on \"Left to My Own Devices\", in 1988.

The association with Adi Newton was short; Newton left The Future and went on to form Clock DVA. Ware at this point decided that he needed a singer rather than another keyboard player. The reason for this was twofold: record companies had been reluctant to sign The Future, as they could not offer any \"marketable\" songs, and therefore a talented singer was required for any chance of commercial success; also the group only owned two synthesizers and could not afford a third."]}, {"page": "Erasure", "response": ["On 27 May 2014, Erasure announced their sixteenth studio album for a September 2014 release, a 10-track record titled The Violet Flame.
