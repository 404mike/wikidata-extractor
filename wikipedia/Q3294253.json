Her uncle is the Welsh 52-time capped international rugby union player Mark Taylor. She plays rugby in the scrum-half position, and was educated at Ysgol Dewi Sent and Ysgol y Strade. Knight's physical education teacher at secondary school encouraged her to play alongside boys until she prohibited from doing so per school regulations. She matriculated to Swansea University and studied medical genetics. She later went on to study to become a midwife at King's College London, having been inspired from support after giving birth when battling Tokophobia. Knight's dissertation was on researching international athletes and the perspective of being pregnant and giving birth. "]}]}}
