Anderson was a forward with Manchester United whose career started in 1911. Anderson went on to score 39 goals for United, and scored another 39 unofficial goals during the First World War.\nAnderson was involved in a match fixing scandal that ended his career. In a game at Old Trafford on 29 December 1917 against Burnley, he was accused of fixing the match after three United players complained to the team president. He was then banned from Old Trafford on 8 January 1918 and later sentenced to eight months in prison after his trial in Liverpool. In 1915, Anderson had already testified during the investigation of the 1915 British football betting scandal, which led to the banning of seven Manchester United and Liverpool players. He is buried in Blackley Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Anderson", "response": ["George Anderson may refer to:", "* George Anderson (accountant-general) (1760\u20131796), English accountant-general to the Board of Control", "* George Anderson (MP) (1819\u20131896), Liberal MP for Glasgow from 1868 to March 1885", "* George Anderson (Australian politician) (1844\u20131919), New South Wales politician", "* George Anderson (educator) (1876\u20131943), British educational administrator in India", "* George Anderson (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u20131930), Scottish footballer (Kilmarnock FC, national team)", "* George Anderson (footballer, born 1879) (1879\u20131962), English footballer (Birmingham FC, Brentford FC)", "* George Anderson (footballer, born 1887) (1887\u20131956), English football player (Sunderland AFC, Aberdeen FC) and manager (Dundee FC)", "* George Anderson (footballer, born 1891) (1891\u20131959), English footballer (Manchester United)", "* George Anderson (footballer, born 1904) (1904\u20131974), Scottish footballer (Norwich City, Bury FC, Huddersfield Town, Mansfield Town)", "* George Anderson (footballer, born 1953), Scottish footballer (Morton, Airdrieonians)", "* George Anderson (Australian footballer) (1886\u20131976), Australian footballer", "* George Anderson (New Zealand footballer), New Zealand international football (soccer) player", "* George Anderson (soccer executive) (1890\u20131985), Canadian soccer executive", "* George Anderson (Canadian soccer) (1901\u2013?), Canadian soccer player", "* George Anderson (cricketer) (1826\u20131902), English cricketer", "* George Anderson (baseball) (1889\u20131962), American baseball player", "* George Anderson (cyclist) (1883-1975), British Olympic cyclist", "* George Anderson (sprinter) (1943\u20132013), American sprinter", "* George Anderson (minister) (1677\u20131756), Scottish clergyman", "* George Anderson (criminal) (1880\u20131925), American bank robber", "* George Anderson (actor) (1886\u20131948), American actor", "* H.
