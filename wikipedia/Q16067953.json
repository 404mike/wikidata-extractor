On the opening day of the 1921\u201322 season, Tommy Winship crossed for Bill Hooper to score Darlington's first Football League goal, against Halifax Town; the goal came so quickly that the Northern Echo reported how Hooper could \"in all probability, lay claim to the honour of being the first player to score a goal in the Northern Section of the Third Division\". Hughie Dickson scored the second with a penalty kick to make the score 2\u20130, and George Malcolm, the club's first Football League captain, and Tommy Greaves also played in the match. Dan Cassidy scored the last-seconds winner to defeat Stockport County in the inaugural Northern Section Cup final in 1934. Dave Carr and Keith Morton scored two of the goals that earned Darlington a draw with Chelsea, League champions only three seasons earlier, in the fourth round of the 1958\u201359 FA Cup, and Carr scored again as Darlington won the replay 4\u20131 to progress to the last 16 of the competition for only the second time in their history. Ray Yeoman captained the team to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1965\u201366, and Ian Miller was captain and Paul Arnison, Liam Hatch and Sam Russell also played as Darlington won the 2011 FA Trophy Final."]}, {"page": "Tommy Winship", "response": ["If Darlington wanted to retain Winship's services for their Second Division campaign, Arsenal required payment to release his registration; a fee of \u00a3100 was agreed, and he became Darlington's player. Likewise, they had to pay \u00a3150 to Bury for the transfer of full-back Tommy Greaves, who had been with the club a similar length of time. By October, the team were struggling at the higher level, and Winship and other of the older men were dropped in favour of \"younger and speedier players\". Darlington retained their Second Division status, and Winship brought his career statistics to 17 goals from 146 Football League matches with the club."]}, {"page": "Tom Penn (footballer)", "response": ["Penn was born in Heath Common, West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1897.. Retrieved 3 December 2016. He played football for nearby Methley Perseverance and Altofts West Riding Colliery before signing for Football League Second Division club Bristol City in 1925. He appeared in six Football League games in his first season, but in his second, his appearances were restricted to the reserve team in the Western and Southern Leagues. In July 1927 he joined Darlington, newly relegated to the Third Division North. He went straight into the team, had a run of 7 matches at left back before losing his place, first to Tommy Greaves and then to James Mellon, and finished the season with 16 appearances, 14 in the league and 2 in the FA Cup."]}, {"page": "Lambert Golightly", "response": ["In Darlington's second season in the Football League, Golightly replaced Irvine Boocock at right back for the match against Hartlepools United in December 1922, and remained in the team for six Third Division South matches, after which Tommy Greaves and Martin Joyce were preferred.

He did not play for the first team until February 1925, in a goalless draw away to Bradford Park Avenue: George Malcolm switched to right back to cover for the absent Tommy Greaves and Harrison took over Malcolm's regular position at left half. That was his last appearance as Darlington went on to win the Northern Section title. He was retained for the coming season in the Second Division, and played for the reserves, but was not used at the higher level."]}]}}
