During the Labour government of 1974 to 1979, he was a junior Defence minister for the Royal Air Force (RAF) (1974\u20131976), a Home Office minister (1976\u20131979) and Shadow Secretary of State for Defence (1980\u20131981).\nThe circumstances of his later life and premature death are cited by physicians who believe the extensive evidence for the biological etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome. Brynmor John had been diagnosed with the illness, and died suddenly immediately after exiting the House of Commons gym. He had been following an exercise regime based on what is argued to be unfounded and unethical medical advice: that sufferers may exercise their way toward a cure for the illness.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nigel Evans", "response": ["In 1985, Evans was elected as a councillor to the West Glamorgan County Council.
