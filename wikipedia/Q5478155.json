The $40,000 artwork was created by artists Rodney Glick and Marco Marcon and featured the image of a young boy and a middle-aged woman who are not real people but a composite generated from over 250 photos of residents from the Cockburn area. Throughout the years the artworks (which were clearly visible from the Kwinana Freeway) received polarising opinions from the community, with some mistakenly believing the images to be that of missing persons, while Member for Cockburn Fran Logan called the artwork \"weird, confusing and frankly a little creepy\". The Public Transport Authority considered removing the artworks in 2015 after a rise in social media comments but following consultation with the council and a public survey, the artwork was retained. However the condition of the artworks deteriorated over time and in October 2019, the two images were removed due to safety concerns.GONE!
