After creating his own publishing firm at the age of just 24 years old, he launched The World's Classics series (still published by Oxford University Press as Oxford World's Classics) and published such as George Bernard Shaw, A. E. Housman, Samuel Butler and James Joyce. He made \"a significant impact on the publishing business of the early twentieth century\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Joyce", "response": ["During his first stay in Trieste, Joyce continued to develop as an independent author. In June, before Georgio was born, Joyce felt financially secure enough that he had his satirical poem \"Holy Office\" printed and sent copies to Stanislaus to distribute to his former associates in Dublin. He had written 24 chapters of Stephen Hero. and he completed all but the last short story that would eventually comprise the final version of the Dubliners. He also tried unsuccessfully to publish various versions of the Dubliners during this time. Grant Richards, a London publisher, had contracted with Joyce to publish them but the language in the book made the printers unwilling to print it, as English law could hold them liable if they were brought to court for indecent language. Richards and Joyce went back and forth trying to find a solution where the book could avoid legal liability while preserving Joyce's sense of artistic integrity. As they continued to negotiate, Richards began to scrutinize the stories more carefully and became concerned that the book would damage his publishing house's reputation, eventually backing down from his publishing agreement.", "In 1913, Joyce's fortunes changed for the better. Grant Richards, to whom he had resubmitted The Dubliners, agreed to publish it this time. It would be issued in the following year on 15 June 1914, eight and a half years since Joyce had first submitted it to him. In addition, Joyce's career as a writer opened up when he found an unexpected advocate in Ezra Pound, who reached out to him on the advice of Yeats.   Pound, who he had never met, wrote that he wanted to include a poem from Chamber Music, \"I Hear an Army Charging upon the Land\" into the journal Des Imagistes. In the years that followed, they struck up a correspondence that would last until the late 1930s. Pound would strive to ensure that Joyce's works were published and those works would get publicity through reviews. Pound also proposed to publish Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man serially in the magazine, The Egoist. Joyce agreed. Joyce's pace of writing increased during this time.  He completed Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by 1914.  He began Giacomo Joyce, a novelette exploring a teacher's infatuation with a student, which he eventually abandoned; he resumed work on Exiles, which he completed in 1915; and, he also began writing Ulysses. In August 1914, World War I broke out. Although Joyce and Stanislaus were subjects of England, which was now at war with Austria-Hungary, they remained in Trieste. Even when Stanislaus, who had publicly expressed his sympathy for the Triestine irredentists, was interned at the beginning of January 1915, Joyce chose to remain. In May 1915 Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary, and less than a month later Joyce finally decided to take his family to Z\u00fcrich in neutral Switzerland.", "Dubliners is a collection of 15 short stories by Joyce, first published in 1914, by Grant Richards Ltd. They form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle-class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century. The stories were written when Irish nationalism was at its peak, and a search for a national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses.The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence, and maturity."]}, {"page": "Robert Frost", "response": ["* 1923. New Hampshire.

The London house of Grant Richards agreed to publish it in 1905. Its printer, however, refused to set one of the stories (\"Two Gallants\"), and Richards then began to press Joyce to remove a number of other passages that he claimed the printer also refused to set. Joyce protested but eventually did agree to some of the requested changes. Richards eventually backed out of the deal. Joyce thereupon resubmitted the manuscript to other publishers, and about three years later (1909) he found a willing candidate in Maunsel & Roberts of Dublin. Yet, a similar controversy developed and Maunsel too refused to publish it, even threatening to sue Joyce for printing costs already incurred. Joyce offered to pay the printing costs himself if the sheets were turned over to him and he was allowed to complete the job elsewhere and distribute the book, but when Joyce arrived at the printers they refused to surrender the sheets. They burned them the next day. Joyce managed to save one copy, which he obtained \"by ruse\". He then returned to submitting the manuscript to other publishers, and in 1914 Grant Richards once again agreed to publish the book, using the page proofs saved from Maunsel as copy.Jeri Johnson, \"Composition and Publication History\", in James Joyce, Dubliners (Oxford University Press, 2000).", "* Grant Richards Ltd, London, 1914 digitised copy of first edition from Internet Archive"]}, {"page": "M.

Unrepentant, Shiel served sixteen months hard labour in prison, complaining to the Home Secretary about the law, though he assured his publisher Grant Richards in a letter that he had been treated well. Shiel's discussion of his crime is disingenuous; he conceals from Richards the identity of his victim in addition to misleading him about her age, and instead refers to \"love-toyings\" with an older girl on the cusp of maturity. Nor does Shiel mention that he had known both the girl and her mother's sisters long before his conviction, perhaps intimately, as contemporary letters from one of the sisters to Shiel suggest. Court records described Shiel as a \"clerk and metal worker\"; one of the witnesses was a metal worker and the records may have transposed some information.Billings 2010, 285.
