From 1943 to 1960 he was chief music critic of The Times. From his student days Howes gravitated towards criticism as his musical specialism, guided by the advice of the conductor and professor Sir Hugh Allen and the critic H C Colles.\nHowes was known for his affinity with English music in the tradition of the \"English Musical Renaissance\"; after 1945 he found the less nationalistic, more cosmopolitan nature of post-war composers uncongenial.\nIn addition to his work for The Times, Howes wrote fifteen books, and served on many musical committees for bodies including the BBC and the Arts Council.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
