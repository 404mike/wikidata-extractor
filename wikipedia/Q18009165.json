From 1943 to 1960 he was chief music critic of The Times. From his student days Howes gravitated towards criticism as his musical specialism, guided by the advice of the conductor and professor Sir Hugh Allen and the critic H C Colles.\nHowes was known for his affinity with English music in the tradition of the \"English Musical Renaissance\"; after 1945 he found the less nationalistic, more cosmopolitan nature of post-war composers uncongenial.\nIn addition to his work for The Times, Howes wrote fifteen books, and served on many musical committees for bodies including the BBC and the Arts Council.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Elgar", "response": ["By the 1960s, a less severe view was being taken of the Edwardian era. In 1966 the critic Frank Howes wrote that Elgar reflected the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but \"a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work.\u00a0... Elgar is historically important for giving to English music a sense of the orchestra, for expressing what it felt like to be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations.\"", "Among Elgar's admirers there is disagreement about which of his works are to be regarded as masterpieces. The Enigma Variations are generally counted among them.Reed, p. 180; Kennedy (ODNB), McVeagh (Grove), Sackville-West, p. 254; and in a centenary symposium in 1957 a variety of composers, scholars and performers, include Enigma among their favourite Elgar works.

The movement opens with a pedal C in the bass, answered by a horn call outlining a D major chord in a dotted rhythm, which implies mixolydian D.  { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 \\key g \\major \\tempo \"Moderato\" 4 = 80 r2 <fis d>4.\\p( <e a,>8 | <fis d>4. <e a,>8 <fis d>2) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 <c c,>1~ | <c c,>2. s4 } >> }  The violins use the notes of the pentatonic scale, making the key ambiguous. Wilfrid Mellers believes this is why Vaughan Williams billed the movement as a Preludio, \"which suggests an emergent state\".Mellers, pp. 176\u2013177 The horn call motif fluctuates from major to minor, outlining the tonal ambiguity, moving between the mixolydian and dorian modes, which becomes a characteristic of the movement. The bass's C pedal becomes the tonic when the key changes to either the aeolian or dorian modes. The modality then moves to E, with a new melody in the violins, which, although it does not include a sharpened seventh, outlines E major. The bass, now played pizzicato, supports the melody both melodically and harmonically and the texture incorporates suspensions and passing notes, making the harmony richer. A sudden descent of a semitone, an idea previously used in Vaughan Williams's works Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis and Job, marks a key change to three flats and also the development section.Mellers, pp. 177\u2013178", "The third and fourth lines were later sung in the opera by Pilgrim.

It is not clear why the composer called it \"Romanza\".Cox, p. 122 Howes comments that with its spiritual, meditative nature there is nothing \"romantic\" about this movement;Howes, p. x Michael Kennedy observes that with Vaughan Williams the term \"is always a signal that the music was of special significance to him\".Kennedy, p. 289"]}, {"page": "Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis", "response": ["The term \"fantasia\", according to Frank Howes in his study of Vaughan Williams's works, referred to the 16th-century forerunner of the fugue \"in that a thread of theme was enunciated and taken up by other parts, then dropped in favour of another akin to it which was similarly treated\".Howes, p. 91 Vaughan Williams's fantasia draws on but does not strictly follow this precept, containing sections in which the material is interrelated, although with little wholly imitative writing, and antiphony in preference to contrapuntal echoing of themes."]}, {"page": "Violin Concerto (Walton)", "response": ["2.

The second subject, deriving from the rocking figure of the first movement, is in the minor. The development section mainly features on the first theme, gradually dividing it into fragments accompanying a long cantabile theme for the viola and later the woodwind. In the recapitulation the first theme is given to the full orchestra, and the second to woodwind and horn, with a viola counter-theme. A development passage leads to the coda that draws the earlier themes into a characteristic Walton fugal treatment, leading to the climactic synthesis of the themes.Kennedy, p. 51; and Tierney, p. 188 The solo viola re-enters with the lyrical opening theme of the first movement.
