Of the players who made their debut the greatest contributor was Harold Wild who played 32 matches in four seasons. Thomas Revill also played intermittently over four seasons. Norton Hughes-Hallett played in the two seasons before the war, while  Terence Cole and Willie Smith only appeared in the 1913 season."]}]}}
