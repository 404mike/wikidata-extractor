His house was bombed in 1940 during World War II, at which point he moved to a caravan on a patch of woodland near Petworth in West Sussex. He worked there for the next forty years, gradually augmenting his caravan with a series of buildings. He is particularly well known for panoramic landscape paintings created from blocks of colour. There is a huge mural by him in the main hall of Cecil Sharp House. His work was exhibited in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1956.\nHitchens was the son of the artist Alfred Hitchens.

"]}, {"page": "William Tillyer", "response": ["In 1987, the Bernard Jacobson Gallery showed a selection of Tillyer's 'English Landscape Watercolours'. The title-page of the catalogue states: \"From April 1985 until March 1987, William Tillyer travelled throughout the British Isles and produces over 200 watercolours.\" Twenty-seven of these were exhibited and finely reproduced in the catalogue. Peter Fuller's thoughtful introduction raises a number of points. It outlines Tillyer's position vis-\u00e0-vis tradition and innovation: \"Tillyer's paintings depend, for their aesthetic effects, upon his responses to the world of nature; and yet, at the same time, his pictures do not offer a reproduction of the appearances of that world. Indeed, they seem to be deeply involved with that kind of questioning of the nature of the medium itself, so typical of late modernist concerns; Tillyer's painting in oil shows a characteristically self-critical doubt about the validity of illusion and representation, and a restless preoccupation with the nature of the picture plane, the support and the framing edge. Tillyer often seeks out 'radical' solutions, assaulting the surface, tearing, reconstituting, collaging.\" Fuller goes on to outline the history of English watercolour painting, associating Tillyer's use of the medium especially with the examples of Alexander Cozens and Thomas Girtin. He also stresses how Turner and others enlarged the effects achieved in it by \"roughing and scraping the surface of the paper\" and other such means, while Ruskin recommended the admixture of white to make watercolour opaque. Girtin, before Ruskin weighed in, had \"sought to 'purify' the practice of watercolour\" and made positive use of the whiteness of his chosen paper, together with delicate and also denser washes of colour. Fuller found this technique in Tillyer. He concludes: \"that in watercolours, and perhaps only in watercolours, the great cry of the Romantic aesthetic (i.e. 'Truth to Nature') and that of emergent Modernism (i.e. 'Truth to Materials') were, in effect, one and the same. For, when used in a way which preserved the particular qualities of the medium (even at the price of loss of immediate resemblance to the appearance of things) watercolour painting seemed to come closest to embodying the fragility, and elusive spontaneity, of our perceptions of nature itself.\" This, he adds, is what \"Tillyer seems to have understood so fully.\" Thus Tillyer appeared to be extending the researches of Ivon Hitchens and of Patrick Heron, Peter Lanyon and others associated with St Ives, fusing their response to nature, inherited from Romanticism, with the modern call for independent, often abstract image-making, guided by the doctrine of 'Truth to Materials'. In this, Fuller argues, we should recognise \"a quest for spiritual values\"; indeed this is a function of the continuing vitality of English landscape painting. Here Fuller makes good use of a quotation from Ruskin: \"The English tradition of landscape, culminating in Turner, is nothing other than a healthy effort to fill the void which the destruction of Gothic architecture has left.\" To this tradition belong, according to Fuller, \"Tillyer's best watercolours\" even as they declare their modernity: his response to nature is linked to \"the search for 'spiritual values'.\" Thus Tillyer is saved from what Fuller sees as late modern art's \"greatest weakness\": ending in \"aesthetic failure\" in pursuit of \"an abstract 'art of the real'.\" Tillyer's watercolours are beautiful in themselves. His gentle washes of colour tell us that our finest aesthetic feelings are intimately related to out experience of nature. Not to be aware of that which leads us \"to injustice and to exploit the natural world (and, indeed, each other).\" Tillyer's watercolours invite us to share with him a tentative and tremulous sensation of physical and spiritual oneness with the natural world."]}, {"page": "1941 in art", "response": ["* Ivon Hitchens"]}, {"page": "Hitchens", "response": ["* Ivon Hitchens (1893\u20131979), English painter"]}, {"page": "The Collection (Lincolnshire)", "response": ["The long-established displays in the Usher Gallery include furniture, clocks and other forms of the decorative arts, from Usher's collection.
