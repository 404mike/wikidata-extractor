Because of this, Hasan Ali Shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the Ismaili form of Islam. Although most of the members of the community signed a document issued by Hasan Ali Shah summarizing the practices of the Ismailis, a group of dissenting Khojas surprisingly asserted that the community had always been Sunni. This group was outcast by the unanimous vote of all the Khojas assembled in Bombay. In 1866, these dissenters filed a suit in the Bombay High Court against Hasan Ali Shah, claiming that the Khojas had been Sunni Muslims from the very beginning. The case, commonly referred to as the Aga Khan Case, was heard by Sir Joseph Arnould. The hearing lasted several weeks, and included testimony from Hasan Ali Shah himself. After reviewing the history of the community, Justice Arnould gave a definitive and detailed judgement against the plaintiffs and in favour of Hasan Ali Shah and other defendants. The judgement was significant in that it legally established the status of the Khojas as a community referred to as Shia Nizari Ismailis, and of Hasan Ali Shah as the spiritual head of that community. Hasan Ali Shah's authority thereafter was not seriously challenged again."]}, {"page": "Newdigate Prize", "response": ["* 1834: The Hospice of St. Bernard.

The case of Ardesir Cursetjee v. Peeroxebai, which came up on appeal before the privy council in England, brought to light the strange fact that even the supreme court of Bombay had no jurisdiction over matrimonial and ecclesiastical disputes among Parsees. This state of lawlessness was recognized by that community as intolerable, and the agitation which ensued thereupon led to the appointment of a commission, of which the distinguished jurist, Sir Joseph Arnould, was the president and Framjee Patel the chief Parsee member."]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Joseph Arnould (1813\u20131886), British judge in India and great-uncle of Laurence Olivier"]}, {"page": "Insurance Hall of Fame", "response": ["*Joseph Arnould - India"]}, {"page": "Arnould", "response": ["*Joseph Arnould (1813\u20131886), British judge in India and writer"]}, {"page": "Aga Khan case", "response": ["The Aga Khan Case was an 1866 court decision in the High Court of Bombay by Justice Sir Joseph Arnould that established the authority of the first Aga Khan, Hasan Ali Shah, as the head of the Bombay Khoja community.Purohit, Teena (2001).

The case was followed with great interest by the press and thousands of the general public attended the case in court. In the course of the case, the sect's philosophies were examined and compared with other Hindu texts by missionary orientalist scholars like John Wilson. Doctors, including Bhau Daji, testified to having treated the religious leader for syphilis and several witnesses recounted his erotic escapades. Max Weber examined the religious sect and noted that their path to salvation was based on sexual orgies. The case went in favour of the journalist and Judge Joseph Arnould pronounced that he was only doing his duty as a journalist of exposing the misdeeds of the religious leader. In his own words - \"a public journalist is a public teacher: the true function of the press, that by virtue of which it has rightly grown to be one of the great powers of the modern world\u2014is the function of teaching, elevating and enlightening those who fall within the range of its influence.\""]}, {"page": "Haji Bibi case", "response": ["Since the Alamut period, the Nizari Imams had been settled within Persia. Although they often received religious offerings from their followers in the Indian subcontinent, there was little done to label the satpanth as Ismailis / Nizaris or unify the community under the Imam's authority. Aga Khan I was similarly born in Persia, but due to conflict with the ruling Qajar government, was forced to flee in 1841. He eventually settled in Bombay in 1848 where he proceeded to assert his authority on all sorts of issues related to the large Khoja population, including controlling the communally owned property.Daniel Beben, \"Introduction\" in The First Aga Khan: Memoirs of the 46th Ismaili Imam, 1-60. While a number of the Khojas accepted the Aga Khan I as their new leader, a number of dissenters challenged his authority in what is now known as the Aga Khan case of 1866. The decision by Sir Joseph Arnould concluded that the Khoja were Shia Muslim and not Sunni, with the hereditary line leading to Aga Khan I as their rightful leaders."]}, {"page": "Arnould, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Arnould"]}]}}
