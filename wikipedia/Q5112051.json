Goodwin", "response": ["Goodwin was born in New Castle, Indiana. He received his BA and PhD at Harvard and taught there from 1942 until 1950. He fled the United States during the McCarthy era, then taught at the University of Cambridge until 1979 and the University of Siena until 1984.. Although he became a university lecturer in the Cambridge faculty of economics and politics in 1951, it was not until five years later that he agreed to join the fellowship of a college, choosing that of Peterhouse. Christopher Calladine thinks that this unusual situation may have been because Goodwin initially had ideological opposition to the notion of the college system, which he may have considered to be anachronistic. Later, after retiring from Cambridge,. Goodwin was the first non-Italian professor of economics at Siena.."]}, {"page": "Christopher Reuben Calladine", "response": ["#REDIRECTChristopher Calladine"]}, {"page": "Calladine, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Calladine"]}, {"page": "Calladine", "response": ["*Christopher Calladine (born 1935), British engineer"]}]}}
