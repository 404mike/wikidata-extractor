Accessed 29 November 2009. The writer and dandy Julian MacLaren-Ross recalled in his Memoirs of the Forties that Meary James Thurairajah Tambimuttu aka \"Tambi\", editor of Poetry London, had used the name Fitzrovia. Tambi had apparently claimed to have coined the name Fitzrovia.Willetts, Paul 2003, Fear and Loathing in Fitzrovia: the bizarre life of the writer, actor, Soho Dandy Julian Maclaren-Ross, p. 140. By the time Julian Maclaren-Ross met Tambimuttu and Dylan Thomas in the early 1940s this literary group had moved away from the Fitzroy Tavern, which had become a victim of its own success, and were hanging out in the lesser-known Wheatsheaf and others in Rathbone Place and Gresse Street. Maclaren-Ross recalls Tambimuttu saying: \"Now we go to the Black Horse, the Burglar's Rest, the Marquess of Granby, The Wheatsheaf... in Fitzrovia.\" Maclaren-Ross replied: \"I know the Fitzroy\" to which Tambimuttu said: \"Ah, that was in the Thirties, now they go to other places. Wait and see.\" Tambimuttu then took him on a pub crawl.Maclaren-Ross, Julian (2004), Collected Memoirs, with an introduction by Paul Willetts, Black Spring Press, p. 303.

The plot is as ingenious as ever, the writing more careful, the dialogue both wise and witty; while suspense is engendered from the very start, and maintained skilfully until the final revelation: it will be a clever reader indeed who anticipates this, and though Miss Christie is as usual scrupulously fair in scattering her clues, close attention to the text is necessary if a correct solution of the mystery is to be arrived at before the astute Miss Marple unmasks the culprit.\" The review concluded, \"Miss Christie has several surprises up her sleeve besides the main one, and (this much may be said without spoiling the reader\u2019s pleasure) she once again breaks new ground by creating a weak and kindly murderer who is yet responsible for the deaths of three people: that such a character should, in the last analysis, seem credible, is a tribute to the author\u2019s psychological acumen and originality of concept.\"The Times Literary Supplement, 23 June 1950 (p. 385)"]}, {"page": "They Came to Baghdad", "response": ["Julian MacLaren-Ross enthusiastically reviewed the novel in the 20 April 1951 issue of The Times Literary Supplement and said it was \"more of a thriller than a detective story, though there are plenty of mysteries and two surprises reserved for the closing chapters; one of these is perhaps her best since the unmasking of the criminal in The Seven Dials Mystery.\" He went on to comment on that, \"the easy expertise of the writing is once more a matter for admiration\" and concluded that Christie's powers of invention \"never fail her\".The Times Literary Supplement, 20 April 1951 (p. 241)."]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Redonda", "response": ["A stellar legion of Redondan peers, largely writers, date back to the Shiel and Gawsworth eras.
