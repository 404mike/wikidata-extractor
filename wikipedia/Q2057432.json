He invented the masticator, a machine that shredded rubber scraps and which allowed rubber to be recycled after being formed into blocks or sheets.

In the 1840s he established large works near London for the manufacture of superphosphate of lime. Processes for the vulcanization of rubber were patented by Charles Goodyear in the United States and Thomas Hancock in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by William Henry Perkin in London. He partly transformed aniline into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.,  In the United States, Herbert Henry Dow's use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from brine was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry."]}, {"page": "Mackintosh", "response": ["In 1830 Macintosh's company merged with the clothing company of Thomas Hancock in Manchester.

His discovery initiated decades of successful rubber manufacturing in the Lower Naugatuck Valley in Connecticut, as rubber was adopted to multiple applications, including footwear and tires.  The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company is named after him.", "In the year 1852, Goodyear went to Europe, a trip that he had long planned, and saw Thomas Hancock, then in the employ of Charles Macintosh & Company. Hancock claimed to have invented vulcanization independently, and received a British patent, initiated in 1843, but finalized in 1844.  In 1855, in the last of three patent disputes with fellow British rubber pioneer, Stephen Moulton, Hancock's patent was challenged with the claim that Hancock had copied Goodyear. Goodyear attended the trial. If Hancock lost, Goodyear stood to have his own British patent application granted, allowing him to claim royalties from both Hancock and Moulton. Both had examined Goodyear's vulcanized rubber in 1842, but several chemists testified that it would not have been possible to determine how it was made by studying it. Hancock prevailed.", "Despite his misfortune with patents, Goodyear wrote, \u201cIn reflecting upon the past, as relates to these branches of industry, the writer is not disposed to repine, and say that he has planted, and others have gathered the fruits. The advantages of a career in life should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents, as is too often done. Man has just cause for regret when he sows and no one reaps.\u201dGoodyear, C. (1939).

Henri, along with Christian Sch\u00f6nbein and others, developed derivatives of the natural polymer cellulose, producing new, semi-synthetic materials, such as celluloid and cellulose acetate.  The term \"polymer\" was coined in 1833 by J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius, though Berzelius did little that would be considered polymer science in the modern sense. In the 1840s, Friedrich Ludersdorf and Nathaniel Hayward independently discovered that adding sulfur to raw natural rubber (polyisoprene) helped prevent the material from becoming sticky.  In 1844 Charles Goodyear received a U.S. patent for vulcanizing natural rubber with sulfur and heat.  Thomas Hancock had received a patent for the same process in the UK the year before. This process strengthened natural rubber and prevented it from melting with heat without losing flexibility.  This made practical products such as waterproofed articles possible. It also facilitated practical manufacture of such rubberized materials. Vulcanized rubber represents the first commercially successful product of polymer research.  In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber plant based on regenerated cellulose, or viscose rayon, as a substitute for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic plastic, a thermosetting phenol\u2013formaldehyde resin called Bakelite."]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 1820: The Rubber Masticator, a machine for recycling rubber, invented by Thomas Hancock (1786\u20131865).", "* 1843: Vulcanisation of rubber, a process for making natural rubber more durable, patented by Thomas Hancock (1786\u20131865)."]}, {"page": "Walter Hancock", "response": ["Walter Hancock (16 June 1799 \u2013 14 May 1852) was an English inventor of the Victorian period.

The first rubber condom was produced in 1855, and by the late 1850s several major rubber companies were mass-producing, among other items, rubber condoms. A main advantage of rubber condoms was their reusability, making them a more economical choice in the long term. Compared to the 19th-century rubber condoms, however, skin condoms were initially cheaper and offered better sensitivity. For these reasons, skin condoms remained more popular than the rubber variety. However, by the end of the 19th century \"rubber\" had become a euphemism for condoms in countries around the world.  For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped moulds, then dipping the wrapped moulds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.  The earliest rubber condoms covered only the glans of the penis; a doctor had to measure each man and order the correct size. Even with the medical fittings, however, glans condoms tended to fall off during use. Rubber manufacturers quickly discovered they could sell more devices by manufacturing full-length one-size-fits-all condoms to be sold in pharmacies."]}, {"page": "List of British innovations and discoveries", "response": ["*Rubber Masticator \u2013 Thomas Hancock", "*Vulcanisation of rubber \u2013 Thomas Hancock"]}, {"page": "Thomas Hancock", "response": ["Thomas Hancock may refer to:", "*Thomas Hancock (merchant) (1703\u20131764), Boston businessman, uncle of John Hancock", "*Thomas Hancock (inventor) (1786\u20131865), English inventor who founded the British rubber industry", "*Thomas Hancock (VC) (1823\u20131871), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Riding coat", "response": ["The rubber processing pioneer Thomas Hancock (1786\u20131865) was aware of Macintosh\u2019s work and in 1825 he took out a licence to manufacture the patented \"waterproof double textures\".
