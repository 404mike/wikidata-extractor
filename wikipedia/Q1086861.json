In 1951 he starred alongside Alec Guinness in The Lavender Hill Mob, ranked 17th out of the 100 best British films by the British Film Institute. His profile was raised as Tony Hancock's co-star in Hancock's Half Hour, first in the radio series and later when it was adapted for television and ran from 1954 to 1960. Afterwards, he became known as a regular performer in the Carry On films, appearing in nineteen films of the series, with the top billing role in 17 (in the other two he was cast below Frankie Howerd). Meanwhile, his starring roles in television sitcoms continued for the rest of his life. He starred alongside Diana Coupland in the 1970s sitcom Bless This House until his death in 1976.\nRemembered for a lascivious persona in the Carry On films, with the Snopes website describing him as \"the grand old man of dirty laughter\", he became known for his amiability in his later television work.
