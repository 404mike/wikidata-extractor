Joe was the less successful of the two brothers; he had to wait nearly fifteen months for his debut, which finally came on 21 March 1908, against Manchester United.In total, Satterthwaite played five times for Arsenal, scoring one goal. In two of those league games, he starred with his brother Charlie, making them only one of three pairs of brothers to play together for Arsenal.Arsenal signed Sam Raybould in the summer of 1908, and Satterthwaite was forced out of the side as a result; he left Arsenal to join Grimsby Town in November 1908.", "link_mentions": {}}}
