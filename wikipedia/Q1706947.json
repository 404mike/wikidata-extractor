After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, her travel permit was annulled by the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Interior, so that she couldn't come back. She decided to stay in the United Kingdom and a year later, she became an associate in the Louis de Soissons Partnership. Here, she spent eight years working on design and construction of the Brighton Marina. In 1976, she became a British citizen. By the end of 1980 she had formed her own practice alongside David Hodges. From here, she began to be recognized for her work in architectural competitions with her business partner. During this time, Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 also shifted from technical architectural projects to interior design assignments, but still incorporated the complexities of  her architectural background. Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 continued to gain recognition in the mid-eighties. She met fashion designer and entrepreneur Joseph Ettedgui, designing several of his Joseph retail shops in London, and eventually his own Knightsbridge flat. Her work on the interior design of Lloyd's Headquarters in London made her really noticed. She was later asked by Steve Jobs to work on the Apple store concept, but ultimately they went their separate ways. By 1985 she had formed Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 Kerr Associates with Kathy Kerr, a practice which is still operating, now under the name of Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 Architects.
