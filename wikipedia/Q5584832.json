The Belfast Trust was established; its chairman was Rear-Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles, captain of Belfast from January 1961 to July 1962. As Member of Parliament (MP) for Winchester, Morgan-Giles addressed the House of Commons on 8 March 1971. He described Belfast as being in \"a really wonderful state of preservation\" and that saving her for the nation represented a \"case of grasping the last opportunity\". Among the MPs who spoke in support of Morgan-Giles was Gordon Bagier, MP for Sunderland South, who served as a Royal Marine gunner aboard Belfast and was present at both the sinking of Scharnhorst and the Normandy landings. Speaking for the government, the Under-secretary for the Navy, Peter Michael Kirk, said that Belfast was \"one of the most historic ships which the Navy has had in the last 20 years\", but that he could not prevent the stripping of the ship's removable equipment, as this was already too far advanced to be halted. He did, however, agree to postpone any decision on the scrapping of Belfast to allow the Trust to put together a formal proposal."]}, {"page": "Chris Mullin (politician)", "response": ["Mullin was first elected MP for Sunderland South in 1987, and was returned at every subsequent election up to and including 2005. His constituency was the first to declare in every general election between 1992 and his standing down in 2010 (1992, 1997, 2001 and 2005). Mullin joked about being the UK's sole MP for a few minutes and muses about forming a government. He did not seek re-election in 2010. Mullin was on the left of the party and his selection for Sunderland South (occasioned by the retirement of Gordon Bagier MP) met with the disapproval of Neil Kinnock, at the time the Leader of the Labour Party. In the late 1980s, the right-wing, tabloid press targeted Mullin for his left-wing views frequently. Headlines included: \"20 things you didn't know about crackpot Chris\", \"Loony Lefty MP\", and \"Is this the most odious man in Britain?\""]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: B", "response": ["*Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "Sunderland South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["||1964 || Gordon Bagier "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Gordon Bagier"]}, {"page": "Paul Williams (Conservative politician)", "response": ["He became a \"Suez rebel\" in December 1953, urging the government to suspend negotiations with Egypt to evacuate the canal zone, and voted against the Conservative government's Suez policy in July 1954.
