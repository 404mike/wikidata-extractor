The show's mascot, a golden robot called \"Mr. Chips\", appears in many of the animations. In the revived version of the show, the same format remains, but there are three contestants and there is no particular attention paid to gender.", "In the Nick Weir series, there was no money randomiser; the cash prize was set as default to \u00a3100 in round 1 and \u00a3150 in round 2. In Weir's third and final series, the round 2 amount for a normal catchphrase was doubled to \u00a3200, and for the final series with Mark Curry, these were replaced with the corresponding points values.", "A correct answer won the contestant the predetermined money amount, plus a chance to solve the bonus catchphrase, which was hidden behind nine squares with the show's logo on each (or random shapes in the Nick Weir/Mark Curry era). The contestant chose a square by hitting their buzzer to stop a randomiser on one of them. That square was then removed, and the contestant had five seconds to come up with an answer. If they were right, they won the amount of money in the bonus bank.", "In series 1, the bonus bank would start at \u00a3100 and increase by \u00a3100 each round for the first two episodes and for the rest of that series, it would start at \u00a350 and increase by \u00a350 each round. However, in series 2, the bonus bank increased with each regular round, not counting the Ready Money Round. This format carried on from series 2 until series 9. In series 10 (the first Carlton series), it would start at \u00a3150 and increase by \u00a350 each round, but \u00a310 would be deducted for each square removed. From series 11 until series 15, it would start at \u00a3200 and increase by \u00a350 each round, again with \u00a310 deducted for each square removed but in series 16 (Nick Weir's third and final series), the bonus bank still started at \u00a3200 in round 1 and \u00a3400 in round 2. In rounds 1 and 2, it would still eliminate \u00a310 for every random shape removed (Mark Curry's round 2 would deduct by 20 points on the 400 points bonus).

Now, in a similar fashion as on Blockbusters, the contestant had to make their way from the left-hand side of the board to the right (in a horizontal line), making adjoining moves and passing on a square meant that they would be blocked and would have to find an alternative path (excluding diagonals). This format was also used in the Mark Curry series. As before, the top prize was a holiday. In Weir's first series in 2000, the holiday randomiser remained, but from series 15 (2001), this was dropped and instead both contestants each nominated a location of their choice to go to if they won, revealed at the beginning of the show. In the Curry daytime series in 2002, this feature was still included but the choice was limited to somewhere in Europe, and these choices were revealed before the second round of the main game.
