A trait Marquess succeeded with during his time on the series was casting actors never seen as villains in their careers such as Todd Carty as PC Gabriel Kent and Lynda Bellingham as crime boss Irene Radford. However, there were issues with repetition such as two station fires, two serial killer cops in the aforementioned Gabriel Kent and PC Cathy Bradford, non-cop serial killer plots in 2002, 2004 and 2005, over half a dozen different characters being abducted (some more than once) and a slew of romances (something rarely seen prior to Marquess' arrival). Arguably, the most controversial storyline was the insinuation that show veteran Sergeant June Ackland had slept with her own son after PC Gabriel Kent falsely claimed he was her long-lost son (actually proving to be her son's adoptive brother). June actress Trudie Goodwin criticised the plot in a 2018 interview on The Bill Podcast, calling it far-fetched to introduce the element of a long-lost child 20 years into her time on the series, while she also cited issues with character exits and the direction the show was going when she resigned from the role of June after over 20 years, stating she had lost her enjoyment of being on the programme.
