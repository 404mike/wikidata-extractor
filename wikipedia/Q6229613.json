He was only nine years old. Educated at Westminster and New College, Oxford, he became a member of Brooks's in 1949. He married Zoe Scott in 1958, and has two sons.Between 1966-68 Lord and Lady Monk Bretton had Raymond Erith re-model a Queen Anne house his great-grandfather, Sir John Dodson, had acquired near Barcombe from the family of Percy Bysshe Shelley. The Dodsons had hitherto largely just rented it out; Bosie, Lord Alfred Douglas, for example, was a tenant circa 1920. The house, Shelley's Folly, Erith described as 'a little pavilion, on a knoll, built for the view'. Monk Bretton, having consequently sold another larger and newer nearby house, lived there until moving to Switzerland in 2004.\nHe has been a Deputy Lieutenant for East Sussex since 1983, and a stalwart of the South of England Agricultural Society show, at Ardingly, since its foundation in 1967.\nFollowing expulsion from the House of Lords in 1999 following the passing of the House of Lords Act, he moved to the Lake Geneva northern shore.", "link_mentions": []}}
