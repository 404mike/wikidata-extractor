The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Sch\u00e4fer's presentation: \u2033Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. ... I find that even after ... complete denervation, whether of three days\u2019 or ten months\u2019 duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. ... The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.\u2033 The abstract is the \u2033birth certificate\u2033 of chemical neurotransmission.L.

It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1913", "response": ["*Thomas Renton Elliott"]}, {"page": "Medical Research Society", "response": ["The MRS was formed following a report by a subcommittee of the UK Medical Research Council on the \u2018Future Policy for the Promotion of Clinical Research\u2019.
