Four Labour Party MPs preferred to remain as ministers: G. N. Barnes, James Parker, George Henry Roberts and George Wardle.  They, along with the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union-sponsored candidate John R. Bell, contested the election independently of the Labour Party, and were termed \"Coalition Labour\" candidates.  Only Bell and Parker received a Coalition Coupon, and they were wrongly identified in official coalition literature as Coalition National Democratic and Labour Party and Coalition Liberal candidates, respectively.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Statistics, 1918-1968, p.2G. D. H. Cole, History of the Labour Party from 1914, pp.87\u201388  The National Democratic and Labour Party was a separate organisation which also supported the Coalition and had a background in the Labour Party."]}]}}
