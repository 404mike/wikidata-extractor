Four games later, he repeated the feat, scoring all three goals in a 3\u20130 victory over Bristol City. That match marked Pulis's first appearance at Priestfield since his dismissal from the role of Gillingham manager, as he was now in charge of Bristol City; he received a standing ovation from the home fans. Taylor scored for the fifth consecutive game in a 4\u20131 win over Scunthorpe United on 23 November, taking his total to 15 goals in 15 Second Division games; two days later, he was signed by Manchester City for a transfer fee of \u00a31.5\u00a0million, a new record for the highest fee received by Gillingham for a player. His initial replacement in the starting line-up was Rodney Rowe, a recent signing from York City. Despite losing their most prolific goalscorer, the team won their first three games without Taylor and were in fifth position in the league table after a 2\u20131 victory over Colchester United on 26 December.
