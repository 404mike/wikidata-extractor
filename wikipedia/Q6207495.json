Jacques Goddet believed that Merckx was a lesser climber and could not have overhauled Oca\u00f1a, but writer Olivier Dazat suggested that Merckx was mentally stronger and would have relentlessly chased down Oca\u00f1a. Riotte said that Oca\u00f1a's crash was \"provoked\" by Merckx and that if not then, Oca\u00f1a would have faltered eventually."]}, {"page": "Eug\u00e8ne Christophe", "response": ["Christophe was a short and methodical man who raced with a 20 franc coin, a 10 franc coin, a chain link and a spoke key in a chamois bag hung round his neck.

John Borland Wadley joined the weekly magazine, The Bicycle, soon after it started in February 1936. The publication opened as opposition to the established weekly, Cycling, to counter Cycling's perceived establishment views, which included not covering massed racing on the open road after the Second World War and giving what some readers saw as little attention to professional cycling, such as the Tour de France, on the Continent. Cycling was originally dismissive of a breakaway organisation, the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) and frequently campaigned against it and did little to cover its races; The Bicycle, on the other hand, saw itself as neither for or against the BLRC but saw the massed-start racing on the road for which it stood as a normal and even exciting part of cycle-racing. That was also the view of Jock Wadley, who used his enthusiasm for road racing and for France to report from the Continent whenever he could."]}, {"page": "Alan Ramsbottom", "response": ["In 1965, Ramsbottom rode the Grand Prix des Gentilhommes at Lille with the journalist Jock Wadley.
