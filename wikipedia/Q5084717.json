His team proved to be inconsistent, though they did reach the Fourth Round of the League Cup, where they were beaten 3\u20130 by a Manchester United side that included Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Owen, and Antonio Valencia. In the January transfer window he released Graeme Montgomery and Anthony Pulis, whilst making four new loan signings in defenders Troy Brown and Sonny Bradley, midfielder Josh Payne, and striker Charlie Collins. He also recruited defender Chris Doig, and attempted to bolster his side's poor goalscoring record by paying a five figure fee for Cameroonian striker Guy Madjo. He also signed Stefan Payne, Wilko Risser and Josh Payne, as well as loanees Ben Smith, Darren Murphy, Michael Doughty, and Rob Sinclair. To make room for these signings he offloaded Jermaine McGlashan, Jamie Collins, Luke Guttridge, Chris Doig and Aaron Brown.
