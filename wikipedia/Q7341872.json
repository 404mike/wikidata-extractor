He made his name in small ship actions, especially fighting French frigates, of which he captured three. In his later career Barlow served as comptroller of the Navy and was influential at the Admiralty right up to his death. Although born to a middle-class family, Barlow and his siblings made names for themselves and two of Barlow's daughters married into the naval aristocracy. His grandson, Robert Barlow, was a first-class cricketer and army officer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chatham Dockyard", "response": ["* 1808\u20131823 Captain Robert BarlowMarshall, p. 48."]}, {"page": "HMS Phoebe (1795)", "response": ["Phoebe was first commissioned in October 1795 under Captain Robert Barlow, for the Irish Coast and Edward Pellew's squadron.
