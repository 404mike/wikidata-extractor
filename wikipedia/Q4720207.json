He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen and Kincardine Central in the 1918 General Election, but died two months later.\nHe joined the Gordon Highlanders as second lieutenant on 30 June 1900, and served in the Second Boer War in 1900\u201301; taking part in the operations in the Transvaal, east of Pretoria, from July to November 1900, and later in the Orange River Colony. He was promoted to lieutenant on 21 February 1902. The war ended in June 1902, and Gordon left Cape Town on the SS Scot in September, returning home. During the First World War he was head of the Forage Department of the War Office in Scotland, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was also an expert breeder of Shorthorn Cattle.\nAt the 1918 General Election, Gordon won the new constituency of Aberdeen and Kincardine Central by a majority of 638 votes over the Liberal candidate.He never spoke or voted in Parliament, but shortly before his death he was appointed a member of the House of Commons Scottish Standing Committee.\nGordon died, at Newton Insch, Aberdeenshire aged 37, from heart failure after suffering from influenza, just over two months after his election. He thus became one of the shortest-serving MPs in history. It is likely that Gordon was a victim of the 1918 flu pandemic. At the subsequent by-election Murdoch McKenzie Wood gained the seat for the Liberals.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberdeen and Kincardine Central (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alexander Theodore Gordon"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Alexander Theodore Gordon"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Alexander Theodore Gordon"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["|Alexander Theodore Gordon"]}, {"page": "Alexander Gordon", "response": ["* Alexander Theodore Gordon (1881\u20131919), Scottish politician"]}, {"page": "1919 Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire Central by-election", "response": ["The seat had become vacant when the Coalition Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Alexander Theodore Gordon died on 6 March 1919 aged just 37, from heart failure after suffering from influenza.

His West Aberdeenshire constituency was being abolished by boundary changes for the 1918 general election. However, Henderson sought and won the Liberal nomination for the new seat of Central Aberdeenshire.The Times, 12 October 1918 p3 He fought the election against Alexander Theodore Gordon, who stood as a Coalition Conservative, a supporter of the Coalition government of David Lloyd George who presumably received the Coalition coupon. Henderson lost by 638 votes, polling 5,908 votes to Gordon's 6,546.The Times House of Commons 1919; Politico's Publishing 2004 p69 Even the defeat was not sufficient to force Henderson into retirement, however. Early in 1919, Gordon died, causing a by-election in Aberdeenshire Central. It was agreed that Henderson should be the candidate and stand as a full blooded Asquithian Liberal.The Times, 8 March 1919 p12 That posed a difficulty for Lloyd George, who, despite his Liberalism, was being required to endorse another Conservative candidate against a Liberal who had represented the party in Parliament for 16 years. As a result, there was some speculation that Henderson would be asked to stand for the Coalition,The Times, 12 March 1919 p15 which Hederson and his local Liberal Association were willing to accept this. Henderson exchanged letters with Freddie Guest, the Coalition Liberal Chief Whip, coming to an agreement to give overall support to the government, but the Aberdeenshire Tories would not adopt Henderson as the Coalition candidate and chose their own man, L F W Davidson.The Times, 19 March 1919 p11"]}]}}
