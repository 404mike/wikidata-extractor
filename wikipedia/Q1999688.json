According to Geoffrey Ellis, chief executive of NEMS Enterprises, the day before the funeral George Harrison had given Nat Weiss, Epstein's good friend and confidant, a single flower (Ellis remembers it as a chrysanthemum) wrapped in a newspaper on behalf of all four Beatles, with instructions to place the flower on Brian's coffin as a final farewell. However, flowers are forbidden at Jewish funerals and burials. Weiss and Ellis discussed this dilemma while walking back to the grave, where they observed two men beginning to shovel dirt onto the casket. Ellis later wrote: \"Nat, who himself was Jewish, cast the newspaper package unopened onto Brian's coffin, where it was swiftly covered by earth.\"Ellis, Geoffrey, I Should Have Known Better; A Life in Pop Management, p. 133 Epstein was buried in section A grave H12, in the Long Lane Jewish Cemetery, Aintree, Liverpool.Wilson, Scott.

The service at the graveside was held by Rabbi Dr Norman Solomon, who said, disparagingly, that Epstein was \"a symbol of the malaise of our generation\". A few weeks later, on 17 October, all four Beatles attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in St John's Wood (near Abbey Road Studios), which was officiated by Rabbi Louis Jacobs. The Bee Gees' 1968 song \"In the Summer of His Years\" was written and recorded as a tribute to Epstein."]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 011 || Judaism || Norman Solomon ||    (2nd ed.) || 1996 || religion"]}, {"page": "Richard Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth", "response": ["*Abraham's Children: Jews, Christians and Muslims in Conversation (T&T Clark, 2005),  (ed. with Norman Solomon and Tim Winter and Dale Harries)"]}, {"page": "Cave of the Patriarchs massacre", "response": ["Goldstein was widely denounced in Israel and by communities in the Jewish diaspora,Norman Solomon, 'The Ethics of War in Judaism,' in Torkel Brekke (ed.), The ethics of war in Asian civilizations: a comparative perspective  Routledge, 2006, pp39-78 p.44 with many attributing his act to insanity.1 Wilson, Rodney. 2007.

Heinze hand-picked the topics as well as the participating lecturers, bringing public attention to a range of often controversial subjects that were of special interest to him. Two of the lectures garnered particularly strong public interest: one dealt with relations between Catholicism and Judaism (the speakers were Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, and renowned British rabbi, Rabbi Norman Solomon). The other lecture focused on homosexuality. Heinze had wanted to discover if there was a way \"gay and lesbian Jews and Christians [might] find a more comfortable place within their faith-communities.\" (He had wanted to include Muslim speakers but was unable to find anyone.) The lecture was presented in the form of a symposium and was entitled \"New Jewish and Christian Approaches to Homosexuality.\" Even in the liberal community of San Francisco, it sparked heated debate because established religion did not normally deal explicitly with the issue.See:", "# Inaugural Symposium of the Flannery-Hyatt Institute for Interfaith Understanding (2000) \u2013 Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews; Rabbi Norman Solomon, winner of the Sir Edmund Sternberg Award in Christian-Jewish Relations"]}, {"page": "Legal aspects of ritual slaughter", "response": ["According to Jewish law, slaughter of cattle and poultry is carried out with a single cut to the throat.Shulhan Arukh Yorei De'ah According to ShechitaUK, '[a]ll forms of mechanical stunning, which may include asphyxiation by gas, electrocution by tongs or water or shooting with a captive bolt gun, cause pain on application and are thus prohibited by Jewish law.'
