Mijin Cho, in British Quaker women and peace, 1880s to 1920s (Ph.D. dissertation, 2010) has investigated Fry's attitude to pacifism from her diary, finding the evidence inconclusive. She differed on the issue from her sisters. She was not disowned by the Society of Friends. She did author a pacifist pamphlet. She signed a letter appearing in the Positivist Review in 1915, advocating solution of disputes by arbitration, with a group including Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner, William Archer and Gilbert Murray."]}]}}
