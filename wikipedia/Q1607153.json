Meade along with young enthusiasts such as Roy Harrod, Henry Phelps Brown, Charlie Hitch, Robert Hall, Lindley Fraser, Maurice Allen and Eric Hargreaves, who was his old tutor at Oriel College, started the concept of teaching economics as a regular subject for examination which was relatively new at Oxford. Meade was assigned with the responsibility of teaching the whole subject of economic theory. The economics of mass-unemployment and international economics interested Meade in particular. At that time Oxford had a really strong branch of the League of Nations Union with Gilbert Murray as its chairman and Margaret Wilson as its secretary. (Wilson married Meade in 1933.https://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/105p473.pdf) Meade was made a member of the economics section of the League of Nations in Geneva in 1937.

In late 1962 the LTE ordered 33 front entrance Leyland Atlanteans suitable for one man operation. In addition, 6 standee buses were ordered for an experimental central area service as recommended by the Chambers Committee. On 1 January 1963, the London Transport Board replaced the executive, and entered negotiations with the unions to introduce a programme of service reforms. The union countered by submitting a claim for increased pay and a reduced working week, and by October 1963 had instituted a ban on overtime and rest day working. In November 1963, in an attempt to break the deadlock, the Minister of Labour, Joseph Godber, announced that Professor Henry Phelps Brown of the London School of Economics would head a commission of inquiry. The commission's terms of reference allowed them to review the pay and conditions of bus drivers and conductors in light of manpower requirements and working and operating conditions in London traffic. In making their report they were to pay \"due regard to the possibilities of increasing the efficiency of London Transport's road services\". The committee made an interim report on 12 December recommending new rates of pay, which was rapidly implemented, leading to the ending of the overtime ban. The final report of the committee was issued in April 1964.Russell (1980) pp.5-6 The report led to an agreement for:"]}, {"page": "1976 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Professor Ernest Henry Phelps Brown, .
