The home side equalised two minutes before time, substitute Lucas Akins' shot was dropped by goalkeeper Adam Collin, and another substitute, Robin Shroot, was there to tap the ball in from close range. Three days later, on 21 August, Stevenage faced Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road, in the club's first away game of the campaign.
