Jack is re-introduced as a changed man, reluctantly immortal, having spent years on Earth waiting to reunite with the Doctor. Jack recruits policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) to the team of experts after she discovers them; there are hints of romantic feelings between the two, but Gwen has a boyfriend and Jack enters a sexual relationship with the team's general factotum Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd). Despite having worked with him for some time, his present-day colleagues know very little about him; over the course of the series they discover that he cannot die. Jack was once a prisoner of war, and was an interrogator who used torture. In the Torchwood Series 1 finale \"End of Days\", Jack returns to the TARDIS. This immediately leads into the 2007 Doctor Who episode \"Utopia\", where he joins the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). Jack explains he returned from Satellite 5 to the present day by travelling to 1869 via vortex manipulator, and lived through the 20th century waiting for the Doctor. By the series finale, having spent a year in an alternative timeline enslaved by The Master (John Simm), Jack opts to return to his team in Cardiff.

In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a \"palpable love\" and opines that \"with Jack and Gwen, it\u2019s the real thing and they\u2019re going to make you wait for that.\" The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode \"Ghost Machine\" as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of \"her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour\", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: \"the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him\u00a0\u2013 it'd be hard not to\". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a \"compelling trickster\", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his \"outrageous flirting\". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of \"steady prince\" for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, \"he'd have to commit completely\"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could \"never afford to do anything more\". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, \"there\u2019s two different sorts of love going on there\", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death.

Having been enamoured by her television performances, most notably in the 2005 episode of Doctor Who in which she guest-starred, Davies wrote the character of Gwen specifically for Eve Myles. Myles stated that having the part written for her was like her \"own personal Oscar\". Part of the attraction of playing Gwen for Myles was that she had the opportunity to play an action hero with her own accent. Speaking on the casting of Welsh actors on Torchwood, Davies commented that it was deliberately intended, to make the Welsh accent mainstream, \"to make it as acceptable as Scottish or Irish\". In an analysis of Welsh mythology in Torchwood, Lynette Porter observes that Gwen's national consciousness forms part of her characterisation: her knowledge of local myths \"highlights her Welsh heritage and common knowledge from her experience and formal education.\" Discussing the international co-production behind series four, executive producer Julie Gardner commented that Myles' continued involvement helped ensure that the \"flavour of Wales\" remained evident.", "In the first series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an audience surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type to that of 2005\u201306 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): \"She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal.\" Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who at the same time embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. Her distinct role within the team stems from the fact that \"she's there for the people\", who she feels \"instinctive and passionate\" about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more \"human empathy\" than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be \"technology-and-alien-obsessed\". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a \"little bit of soul\" back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: \"she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in\". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a \"fantastic policewoman\" prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to \"open up by making them feel comfortable\". Myles perceived Gwen to be \"the heart and emotion of Torchwood\", and \"Torchwood's social worker\" who can \"run and fight and stand in her own corner and win\". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances \"takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen\". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged \"physically\", \"mentally\" and \"morally\" through portraying the character.", "Eve Myles previously appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\" as Gwyneth, a 19th-century clairvoyant. Gwyneth had a connection to the Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are \"just two names beginning with \"G\".\" Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode \"Journey's End\" alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of \"spatial genetic multiplicity\". Eve Myles said of the two characters, \"it was never on the cards as such, but something in the back of my head always said that they were going to be connected somehow.\" Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that \"It's not familial as we understand it\" instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as \"an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift.\"", "Much of Gwen's characterisation centers on her developing relationship with her partner Rhys. Eve Myles describes the character as Gwen's \"normality base\". The relationship is tested by Gwen's affair with colleague Owen Harper (Gorman), a betrayal which Myles believes to be \"completely out of character\" for Gwen, explaining that the guilt experienced over her actions tears her to pieces. The production team had originally planned for Rhys to die in the first series but he was given a reprieve. Producer Richard Stokes explains that Rhys' presence keeps Gwen from losing her \"heart\" and that without him \"it simply becomes a sci-fi show about sci-fi people, running around and hunting aliens\".Richard Stokes interview, \"That's all Stokes\", Torchwood Magazine, issue 4, May 2008, p. 31. Julie Gardner adds that in the discussion, the writers had felt they could not have written Gwen as ever recovering from Rhys' loss, and so chose not to kill off the character. In his analysis of Gwen, Daniel Rawcliffe opines that Rhys helps to keep her mental health intact, and argues that his presence prevents her from undergoing the same psychological deterioration as Suzie.", "Despite her ongoing relationship with Rhys, the series explores possibilities of a romantic connection between Gwen and her boss Jack. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a \"palpable love\" and stated that \"it's the real thing and they're going to make you wait for that.\" AfterElton's Locksley Hall interprets Jack's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by \"her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour\", whilst Myles states of Gwen's interest in Jack that \"the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him\". Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode \"Ghost Machine\" as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement. Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and \"fights every day to be with [Rhys]\" even though Jack remains \"a huge temptation\". Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between \"Rhys, the sweet, kind handsome prince, and Jack, the compelling trickster\". She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of \"steady prince\" for Gwen. John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her \"he'd have to commit completely\"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could \"never afford to do anything more\".", "Original lead writer Chris Chibnall feels Gwen develops into a stronger character between series one and series two, becoming less \"wide-eyed\" over events happening around her. Frankel writes that \"she is a whole woman now, integrated with all the parts of herself\". In the second series, Eve Myles states, Gwen now \"knows where her feet are\". Costume Designer Ray Holman explains that these developments are reflected in how the production team dresses the character. In the first series Gwen is dressed in a \"faded high street look\" and keeps away from leather clothing. As she becomes more confident in her new vocation, her clothes becomes \"a lot more designer and heroic looking\". In the second series she wears more leather from brands such as Diesel and G-star which Holman describes as \"sexy\" and \"practical\". The overall effect is that Gwen's leathers \"toughen her up a bit, but keep her stylish at the same time\". For fourth series Miracle Day, costume designer Shawna Trpcic declared her intention to take Eve Myles \"out of the nunnery\". Myles recalled vetoing a brassiere she was asked to wear because she felt it to be unnecessarily sexualised and impractical for action sequences. She added that she views Gwen as \"a real woman\" and \"not about tits and arse\".", "Press releases describe Gwen in light of contradictions between her heroic and conventionally feminine roles in the series; despite becoming a \"tough, ruthless warrior, who loves the thrill of the fight\" Gwen remains a \"funny, salty, earthy woman who loves home and family\". Children of Earth sees Gwen become pregnant by husband Rhys; a storyline which IGN writer Asham Haque thought provided \"one of the few hope-giving threads\" in the serial. She gives birth to a baby girl, Anwen, between the third and fourth series. Both Eve Myles and creator Russell T Davies have described this plot development as emblematic of a contradiction at the heart of Gwen's character. Myles, believing that motherhood gives Gwen a greater sense of responsibility, says it makes Gwen \"even more human, and yet even more of a wonder woman\". Whilst talking about the show's fourth series, Davies suggested that it would be \"irresistible\" to use the image of \"Gwen Cooper with baby in one arm and gun in the other\" as promotion. The production team have continued to emphasise this contradictory aspect to Gwen's character, which has proved popular with critics and viewers. For example, a promotional clip for Miracle Day features Gwen firing from her gun in one hand while protectively holding her baby in the other. Zap2it's Mikey O'Connell praised this as one of the trailer's best aspects, praising Gwen as \"the coolest mum ever.\" Reviewing the opening episodes of Miracle Day Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times identified \"the dark humor\" of the sequence as representative of \"the top notes of the British Torchwood\". The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Gee praised the dichotomy between the character's two roles, stating that \"Eve Myles's homely yet badass agent is incredibly charming\".", "Eve Myles has enjoyed an increased profile since being cast as Gwen Cooper in Torchwood and is now considered one of Wales' greatest drama exports. On casting her, Russell T Davies described Myles as \"Wales best kept secret,\" and the actress has been described as a \"Welsh icon\" since appearing in Torchwood, with the Western Mail listing Myles' turn as \"Torchwoods feisty female lead\" as a contributing factor in making her one of Wales' sexiest women, as well as a national institution. In an analysis of Welsh representation in television, Geraint Telfan Davies cited Myles' role in Torchwood, coupled with the popularity of sitcom Gavin & Stacey, as combating prejudice against the Welsh accent. Backing up this claim, Samantha Bennet of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette describes Myles' \"silvery, flowing\" accent as \"exotic\" and Myles herself as a bona fide star. Shortly after Torchwoods premiere, Conservative MP Michael Gove described Gwen Cooper as a \"Celtic Rosselini\" and an example of Welsh sensuality, while in 2006, Wales on Sunday named Myles as its \"Bachelorette of the Year\". In July 2011, The Scotsmans Aidan Smith described Gwen Cooper as \"the sexiest woman in Wales\".", "The more assertive Gwen in Torchwoods third series attracted praise from reviewers: Paul Collins of Total Sci-Fi expressed the opinion that Children of Earth finally shows Gwen's heroic characteristics in a way that had been missing in the first two series, while Daniel Martin from the Guardian stated that \"it's great to see Gwen being so completely badass\". David Cornelius wrote that Gwen succeeds as a strongly written female character that does not pander to stereotypes because writers avoid defining her by any aspect of her adventures. Reviewers commented on Myles' standing as a leading lady: Comic Book Resources' Remy Minnick describes Gwen as \"the true heart of Torchwood\", while Scott Lewinski from Wired magazine described Myles' portrayal as the conscience of the Torchwood team, and the show itself. Total Sci-Fis Jonathan Wilkins felt that the five-part serial marked the emergence of Eve Myles as a star in her own right and opined that she could potentially carry the show without co-star Barrowman. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune stated her belief that the third series' climax showed that Eve Myles has \"grown into the role\" of Gwen, describing her performance as \"outstanding\". Ryan later gave an \"Honourable Mention\" to Gwen when discussing Sci-Fi TV's Most Memorable Female Characters, making her the only Doctor Who franchise character to receive a mention. Critical response to the character remained positive in the fourth series. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph felt Myles \"took the acting honours with a bravura performance\", whilst Charlie Jane Anders stated Gwen to have the strongest moments in the finale which led to \"a new appreciation for her character\".", "Eve Myles won the 2007 Bafta Cymru Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Gwen Cooper, winning over the parent series' actress Billie Piper. She was nominated again for the award in 2008, and again in 2010. In 2010 Myles won the 'Best Actress\" award in the SFX Reader's Awards poll, and was crowned best actress in the 11th annual Airlock Alpha Portal Awards. For her role as Gwen Cooper in Torchwood: Miracle Day Myles was nominated for a Satellite Award in the Best Television Actress category,2011 Satellite Award Nominations and reached the shortlist for the 2012 UK National Television Awards. She has also received a nomination for Best Actress in Television at the 38th Saturn Awards, held in June 2012. Action figures of Gwen have been created in her likeness, which Myles' describes as \"bizarre and wonderful\" and at the same time \"really kind of strange\". In a reader's awards poll in the sixth issue of Torchwood Magazine, Gwen was voted second favourite Torchwood character behind Captain Jack, a ranking she received in a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live interview with writer John Fay. Myles, describing her experiences at various science-fiction conventions, has praised the fan response as \"incredible\" and \"just extraordinary\". Some fans have taken to blacking out their teeth at conventions to mimic her gap toothed appearance, which Myles finds particularly flattering."]}, {"page": "Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama", "response": ["* Eve Myles"]}, {"page": "Margaret John", "response": ["In March 2010, she appeared in the BBC One Wales programme Margaret John \u2013 National Treasure, which featured clips from the last 50 years of television and special guest interviews with, among others, Ruth Jones, Eve Myles and Joanna Page.

The show's second series would see Owen experience death, only to be resurrected and forced to adjust to the uncertainty of his undead existence, before ultimately being destroyed in his final appearance.", "Owen is introduced in the first episode of Torchwood in 2006, as the sarcastic and womanising medical officer for Torchwood Three; the first episode sees him recreationally use alien technology to get a woman and her boyfriend to sleep with him. Owen's first centric episode comes in \"Ghost Machine\", when an alien device makes him experience the rape and murder of a girl in the 1950s, which drives him to seek revenge for her. The next episode sees him kiss teammate Gwen (Eve Myles) in the midst of a Cyberman attack on the Hub, and as the series continues they continue a destructive affair which Gwen conceals from boyfriend Rhys Williams (Kai Owen). Owen remains oblivious to the devotion of teammate Toshiko (Naoko Mori), but experiences real love with a time-lost 1953 pilot Diane (Louise Delamere) and is distraught when she disappears in an attempt to return to her time, and despondent over this, Owen ends the affair with Gwen. Owen investigates a men's 'fight club' which uses alien Weevils, and Owen attempts to allow one to almost devour him; in the episode's d\u00e9nouement, however, Torchwood's captive Weevil mysteriously cowers in fear from Owen. When Captain Jack (John Barrowman) and Toshiko are lost to the past, Owen as second-in-command takes control and fights with Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) over whether to open the Rift and 'rescue them'; Owen truly intends to rescue Diane, and is successful in opening the Rift and saving his teammates, but with consequences, for which Jack fires him. In the series finale, the opened Rift causes global chaos. An apparition of Diane sent by Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin) convinces Owen to lead a mutiny against Jack to open the Rift yet again; Owen goes so far as to shoot Jack twice in the head. Having unwittingly released the demon Abaddon, who is eventually defeated by a resurrected Jack, Owen is shocked to discover that Jack offers Owen his forgiveness."]}, {"page": "Toshiko Sato", "response": ["In the second series (2008) episode \"To the Last Man\", Tosh has a relationship with a soldier from 1918 (Anthony Lewis), who had to be frozen and re-awoken every year until the time was right for him to return to 1918 and heal the Rift. In episode \"Reset\", Owen agrees to go on a date with her, but dies at the end of the episode after being shot in the heart. When Owen is briefly revived by team leader Jack Harkness using a resurrection glove, Tosh says her goodbye to him by confessing that she has always loved him. Owen flatlines, only to revive again permanently, existing in a state resembling undeath. In the episode \"Fragments\", the audience comes to understand how Toshiko came to work for Torchwood; Captain Jack rescued her from a UNIT detention centre where she was held after she was forced to build a sonic modulator for an unnamed terrorist organisation. In the show's second-season finale, \"Exit Wounds\", Toshiko is shot and killed by Gray (Lachlan Nieboer), Jack Harkness's unstable younger brother. She dies within minutes of Owen, having been unable to save him from his own death when he becomes trapped in a nuclear power facility bunker flooding with radioactive material. In the moments before their deaths, Owen apologises to Toshiko for never having managed to bring their relationship to fruition. By initiating the final log-off procedure for her account on the Torchwood computer system, Ianto activates a pre recorded message from Toshiko, in which she thanks Jack for saving her. She tells him that she is grateful for the opportunity to work in Torchwood and that she hoped her contributions were valued.
