He gradually took over leading the proceedings of regional Gorseddau from 1814, when he was awarded the title of Druid. He worked as a stonemason with his father in 1815.  In 1816 he opened a school in Merthyr Tydfil, where he worked as a schoolmaster until the end of his life. He assisted with the publication of his father's work Cyfrinach Beirdd Ynys Prydain (\"Mystery of the bards of the island of Britain\") in 1829.\nIn 1834 he won the bardic chair at the Cardiff Eisteddfod with an awdl entitled Y Derwyddon (The Druids). In 1838 he won the bardic crown at the Abergavenny Eisteddfod for an essay on the Coelbren y Beirdd (the alleged bardic alphabet) which was published in 1840, defending the authenticity of his father's work.On his father's death he was left his father's archive of manuscripts, which he believed were all genuine. After much work compiling and editing 26 volumes, a selection was published in 1848 under the title of the Iolo Manuscripts by the Welsh Manuscripts Society. Much of Taliesin's work was based on that of his father.\nAfter his death in 1847 he was succeeded as Archdruid by Evan Davies (Myfyr Morganwg).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Augusta Hall, Baroness Llanover", "response": ["She was a patron of the Welsh Manuscripts Society, of the Welsh Collegiate Institution at Llandovery, funded the compilation of a Welsh dictionary by Daniel Silvan Evans.

He rented Porth y Glo Farm in Upper Boat, filling the farm with goats and cattle, but was forcibly evicted. He subsequently moved to the newly industrialised Taff Valley near to Pontypridd. It was here in 1823 that the workforce elected him to the position of chief surgeon at the Brown Lenox Chainworks in Pontypridd; he stayed in this job till 1871. In June 1823 he was also appointed medical advisor to the wealthy Crawshay family who owned the ironworks at Merthyr and Treforest. Spending time in Treforest, \"a revolutionary town\", he came under the increasing influence of left-wing political ideas. Being a proud Welsh nationalist, Price found likeminded friends in another wealthy family, the Guests, and gave a speech on Welsh history and literature at their Royal Eisteddfod in 1834, which Lady Charlotte Guest felt to be \"one of the most beautiful and eloquent speeches that was ever heard\". On the basis of it, he was invited to take up the job of judging the eisteddfod's bardic competition, with the prize being awarded to Taliesin Williams, son of famous druid and Welsh nationalist Iolo Morganwg."]}, {"page": "St Donat's Castle", "response": ["The Stradling family served as magistrates, members of parliament, sheriffs and deputy lieutenants of Glamorganshire from the 13th to the 18th centuries. A number achieved more than local fame.

One of Edward's sons, Henry, was seized by pirates in the Bristol Channel while travelling from his Somerset estates to St Donat's, and was released only on payment of a large ransom. This event has subsequently been much embellished by, among others, Taliesin Williams in his account The Doom of Colyn Dolphyn: A Poem, with Notes Illustrative of Various Traditions of Glamorganshire, which involves the eponymous Breton pirate and the witch Mallt-y-Nos.

By 1803, it was already being called C\u00f4r Tewdws by Morganwg's associate William Owen Pughe in his 'Cambrian Biography', published by Morganwg himself, and this was the name generally followed thereafter. Other antiquarians used different dates to those outlined by Morganwg, which had been contradictory, and some favoured the college's destruction by Anglo-Saxon warbands rather than Irish priates."]}, {"page": "William Lewis, 1st Baron Merthyr", "response": ["Lewis was born in 1837 in Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorganshire, the second son of Thomas William Lewis, an engineer at the Plymouth, and his wife Mary Anne.

These were suggested to have again been transcribed by Edward Dafydd, John Bradford and Llywelyn Si\u00f4n.

He read heavily on the subject and concluded that Christianity was merely Druidism in a Jewish garb. Following the death of Taliesin Williams in 1847, Davies proclaimed himself archdruid, and from about 1853 he began to hold religious and druidical services near the Rocking Stone at Pontypridd. For about 25 years the practice of holding meetings at the hour of equinoxes and solstices became a Glamorgan tradition, and Davies published a number of books on druidism. Much of his Neo druidic writings were nothing more than a continuation of the 18th-century revival and thus are built largely around writings produced in the 18th century and after by second-hand sources and theorists.
