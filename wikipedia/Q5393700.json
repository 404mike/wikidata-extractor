Her father was a ship's doctor and her mother was a former art student who had studied at the Slade School of Fine Art. The family moved to Tavistock in Devon, but after the death of her husband, Dod's mother moved the family to Newlyn in 1907. There, at the age of 15, Dod enrolled in the School of Painting run by Elizabeth Forbes and Stanhope Forbes. The Shaws stayed with two other Forbes students, Dod's cousin Cicely Jesse and another woman artist, Tennyson Jesse, in a large townhouse known as Myrtle Cottage. At Forbes, Dod met her future husband Ernest Procter; they were considered Forbes' star pupils. In Newlyn, Dod met Laura Knight, who became a lifelong friend and a considerable influence on her career.", "In 1910 Dod and her mother went to Paris where Dod, alongside Ernest Procter, studied at the Atelier Colarossi. Dod and Ernest were both influenced by Impressionism and Post-impressionism and the artists that they met in France, such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne. The couple married in 1912 at the church in Paul in Cornwall and a year later their son Bill was born. The family established a home at North Corner in Cornwall. Also in 1913, Dod Procter first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art.", "In 1920 Dod and Ernest Procter were commissioned to decorate the Kokine Palace in Rangoon by a Chinese millionaire, Ching Tsong. The commission took a year and required them working with Burmese, Indian and Chinese craftsmen often painting murals at considerable heights within the palace. However Ching Tsong was unimpressed with their work and refused to pay them their agreed fees or provide accommodation so the Procters painted portraits of local people and members of the British colonial administration for an income. The Procters also created designs for etched crystal.", "In the 1930s Dod Procters' style of painting changed completely. Works such as The Orchard (1934), Sheila Among the Ferns (1935) and Kitchen at Myrtle Cottage (1935) display the meticulous finish and lighting of her earlier work but without her previous hard lines and solidly delineated bodies of colour. Ernest Procter died unexpectedly while travelling in 1935. The couple had often staged joint exhibitions at the Leicester Galleries and Dod continued to do so after Ernest's death.", "* 1990: Dod Procter RA and Ernest Procter ARA, Newlyn Orion with Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle", "* Dod Procter RA, 1892-1972/ Ernest Procter ARA, 1886-1935.
