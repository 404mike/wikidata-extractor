He was born in Glasgow into a family that encouraged and valued his natural artistic ability. He exhibited at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts when aged 22, and two years later he had a painting selected for the Royal Academy, in London. In 1875\u201380 he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris, and he was influenced by the French school of rustic naturalism and also by French Impressionism. Working plein-air, he developed a loose, painterly approach to landscape subjects. He was a prolific artist who travelled widely in Europe, India, Japan, the Middle East and America; however, he drew particular inspiration from the north-east coast of Scotland \u2013 a subject to which he returned throughout his life. He exhibited extensively in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh, and became vice-president of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours. He was equally at home with oil painting, and during his lifetime he had 84 paintings selected for exhibition at the Royal Academy. For the last 60 years of his life his home was in London, and he died there at the age of 90 in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Melville", "response": ["in 1878 he travelled to Paris and enrolled at the Atelier Julian (Academie Julian). Here he began to learn about the intricacies of watercolour painting although his niece writes that he spent much time admiring the work of other artists - she mentions Monet's Les Didons Blancs as an influence with its movement, colour and light. He had met a Scottish artist, Robert Weir Allan, who had introduced him to the Impressionists. He then spent the summer of 1879 in Grez-sur-Loing At Grez-sur-Loing a number of artists gathered and they were en plain air adherents, many being followers of Jules Bastien-Lepage. As well as Grez-sur-Loing, Melville visited Granville, Honfleur. He seemed keen to find peasant models who would pose en plein air following in the footsteps of the work of French rural Naturalists. He returned to Edinburgh early in the summer of  1880 and he took a studio in Shandwick Place which he shared with his brother George, a medical student.  He only stayed a few months as he intended to return to France and then to travel to the Middle East."]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Robert Weir Allan (1851-1942) - Glasgow born painter of landscape and marine subjects"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"A\"", "response": ["*Robert Weir Allan (1851\u20131942), Scottish/English painter"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish artists", "response": ["*Robert Weir Allan (1851\u20131942), water-colour and oil painter of landscape and marine subjects"]}]}}
