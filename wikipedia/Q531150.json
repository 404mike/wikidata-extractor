A prolific journalist and writer he also produced a number of novels.\nSims was also a very successful dramatist, writing numerous plays, often in collaboration, several of which had long runs and international success.  He also bred bulldogs, was an avid sportsman and lived richly among a large circle of literary and artistic friends.  Sims earned a fortune from his productive endeavours but had gambled most of it away by the time of his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1892 in music", "response": ["*Blue-Eyed Susan, libretto by George Robert Sims, on London stage"]}, {"page": "Our American Cousin", "response": ["\"Dundrearyisms\", twisted aphorisms in the style of Lord Dundreary (e.g. \"birds of a feather gather no moss\"), enjoyed a brief vogue.

Martyn had been involved in Ireland's cultural and dramatic movements for some years, and was working with Lady Gregory and William Butler Yeats to establish the Irish Literary Theatre. Moore soon became deeply involved in this project and in the broader Irish Literary Revival. He had already written a play, The Strike at Arlingford (1893), which was produced by the Independent Theatre. The play was the result of a challenge between Moore and George Robert Sims over Moore's criticism of all contemporary playwrights in Impressions and Opinions. Moore won the one hundred pound bet made by Sims for a stall to witness an \"unconventional\" play by Moore, though Moore insisted the word \"unconventional\" be excised.Morris, Lloyd R.
