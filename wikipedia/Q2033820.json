For many years he lived in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sam Peckinpah", "response": ["* Peckinpah's penchant for filming action scenes in slow motion was satirized by UK comedian Benny Hill,  playing a milkman in a Western skit called \"The Deputy\" that first aired on his March 29, 1973 special. In one scene, Hill's titular character shoots one of the villains (Bob Todd), who then proceeds to pirouette in extremely slow motion before collapsing."]}, {"page": "Eric Sykes", "response": ["Sykes wrote and appeared in two Thames Television specials broadcast during 1980 \u2013 The Likes of Sykes and Rhubarb Rhubarb. The latter special, a remake of his 1969 short film Rhubarb which Sykes also directed, featured many of his old friends including Jimmy Edwards, Bob Todd, Charlie Drake, Bill Fraser, Roy Kinnear, Beryl Reid, and Norman Rossington. It was his last screen appearance with Hattie Jacques. The film employed an idea drawn from the British showbiz tradition in which extras used the word \"rhubarb\" to simulate low-level background dialogue, which had also been a running joke in The Goon Show. In 1981, Sykes wrote, directed, and starred in the offbeat comedy If You Go Down in the Woods Today for Thames, with a cast including Roy Kinnear, Fulton Mackay, and George Sewell.", "During 1982, Sykes played the Chief Constable in the slapstick police comedy film The Boys in Blue, which starred the comedy duo Cannon and Ball, with Jon Pertwee. For Thames TV that year, he also appeared in and wrote The Eric Sykes 1990 Show with Tommy Cooper and Dandy Nichols and It's Your Move, a wordless slapstick comedy depicting the travails of a couple (Richard Briers and Sylvia Syms) moving into a new home, who hire an accident-prone firm of house removers, headed by Sykes. It featured an all-star cast including Tommy Cooper, Bernard Cribbins, Jimmy Edwards, Irene Handl, Bob Todd, and Andrew Sachs. Sykes produced one further silent movie for Thames in 1988, Mr. H. Is Late, set at a funeral. In 1984, Sykes played the Genie in the children's film Gabrielle and the Doodleman, which also featured Windsor Davies (who would also appear with Sykes in the BBC's Gormenghast in 2000), Bob Todd, Lynsey de Paul, and Gareth Hunt."]}, {"page": "Benny Hill", "response": ["From the start of the 1980s, the show featured a troupe of attractive young women, known collectively as \"Hill's Angels\".

Henry McGee and Bob Todd joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players, and the later shows also featured \"Hill's Little Angels\", a group of cute children including the families of Dennis Kirkland (the show's director) and Sue Upton.

The TV shows were produced by Yvonne Littlewood and lasted for over 20 years. At their peak the shows attracted audiences of some 19\u00a0million viewers. The shows featured his relaxed crooner style, sitting in a rocking chair wearing cardigans or jumpers, sometimes performing comedic Irish songs including \"Paddy McGinty's Goat\", \"Delaney's Donkey\" and \"O'Rafferty's Motor Car\" as well as easy listening and country material on which he accompanied himself on acoustic guitar. Doonican's songs about O'Rafferty were popular enough for the BBC to publish a book, Val Doonican Tells The Adventures of O'Rafferty, which retold five of the tales, in 1969. (PDF) As his were variety shows, his TV programmes gave a number of other performers, such as Dave Allen, early exposure.
