Chesterton", "response": ["Chesterton's socio-economic system of Distributism affected the sculptor Eric Gill, who established a commune of Catholic artists at Ditchling in Sussex. The Ditchling group developed a journal called The Game, in which they expressed many Chestertonian principles, particularly anti-industrialism and an advocacy of religious family life. His novel The Man Who Was Thursday inspired the Irish Republican leader Michael Collins with the idea that \"If you didn't seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out.\"Forester, Margery (2006). Michael Collins \u2013 The Lost Leader, Gill & MacMillan, p. 35. Collins's favourite work of Chesterton was The Napoleon of Notting Hill, and he was \"almost fanatically attached to it\", according to his friend Sir William Darling. His column in the Illustrated London News on 18 September 1909 had a profound effect on Mahatma Gandhi. P. N. Furbank asserts that Gandhi was \"thunderstruck\" when he read it, while Martin Green notes that \"Gandhi was so delighted with this that he told Indian Opinion to reprint it.\" Another convert was Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who said that the book What's Wrong with the World changed his life in terms of ideas and religion.Marchand, Philip (1998). Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and the Messenger: A Biography. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, pp. 28\u201330. The author Neil Gaiman stated that he grew up reading Chesterton in his school's library, and that The Napoleon of Notting Hill influenced his own book Neverwhere. Gaiman based the character Gilbert from the comic book The Sandman on Chesterton,Bender, Hy (2000). The Sandman Companion: A Dreamer's Guide to the Award-Winning Comic Series DC Comics, . while the novel he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett is dedicated to him. The Argentine author and essayist Jorge Luis Borges cited Chesterton as influential on his fiction, telling interviewer Richard Burgin that \"Chesterton knew how to make the most of a detective story.\"Burgin, Richard (1969).

Daley had seen Ackerley's The Prisoners of War at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, and was intrigued by its homosexual theme;  while walking his beat. Daley made the acquaintance of the writer one day when Ackerly was fetching the milk from his doorstep. The pair probably had a brief sexual relationship and remained lifelong friends afterwards.  Through Ackerley, Daley came into contact with a wider circle of writers and artists, including those of the Bloomsbury Group, whose member Duncan Grant painted a portrait of Daley in 1930.  By the age of 25 Daley had become a lover of the writer E. M. Forster, a relationship that lasted for seven years.  P. N. Furbank's 1978 biography of Forster notes that Daley was \"plump, curly-haired, genial and rather cocky in manner: very intelligent, with a taste for music and opera, and a brilliant raconteur.  He was homosexual and made no secret of it; indeed he was wildly indiscreet.  His closest friends, and lovers, were mainly criminals.\"  During this time Forster often accompanied Daley on his beat and Daley introduced him to a number of his working-class acquaintances.  Forster considered that Daley was too indiscreet and friendly with criminals and ended their relationship in 1932."]}]}}
