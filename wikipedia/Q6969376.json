However, he soon lost his place in the right\u2013back position to Nathan Thompson and was demoted to the substitute bench. Despite this, Devera's first team run continued, as he began to play in the centre\u2013back position. However, Devera was sidelined with a hamstring injury and was eventually placed on the substitute bench. It wasn't until on 9 March 2013 when he returned to the first team, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2\u20132 draw against Walsall. Devera later featured in the remaining three league matches of the season, starting all of them. Devera was part of the 'Robins' side that reached the play-offs and faced Brentford. Swindon lost on penalties in the second leg of the semi-finals but Devera managed to score a goal. The semi-final second leg was Devera's last game for Swindon and he was released after making 66 appearances in all competitions.\"Robins release retained list\"  Swindon Advertiser. 9 May 2013.
