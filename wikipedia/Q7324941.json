His work is strongly influenced by the writings of the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer on hermeneutics and interpretation theory, particularly as developed by Coyne's colleague Adrian Snodgrass in the 1990s, and with whom he co-authored the book Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking.He is Professor of Architectural Computing and was Head of the School of Arts, Culture and Environment (which covered the disciplines of architecture, history of art and music) until its merger with Edinburgh College of Art. Coyne is an architect by training and brings a design-oriented and spatial understanding to his research and writing on digital themes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hermeneutics", "response": ["There are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer, such as Christian Norberg-Schulz, and Nader El-Bizri in the circles of  phenomenology. Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians).Jones, L. 2000. The Hermeneutics of Sacred Architecture: Experience, Interpretation, Comparison, p. 263;Volume Two: Hermeneutical Calisthenics: A Morphology of Ritual-Architectural Priorities, Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University Press Dalibor Vesely situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture.Vesely, D. 2004.

Adrian Snodgrass sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness.Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking, London: Routledge, pp. 165\u2013180. He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation.Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking, London: Routledge, pp. 29\u201355 Along with Richard Coyne, he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.Snodgrass, A.B., and Coyne, R.D. 1992. \"Models, Metaphors and the Hermeneutics of Designing.\" Design Issues, 9(1): 56 74."]}, {"page": "Online identity", "response": ["Dorian Wiszniewski and Richard Coyne, in their contribution to the book Building Virtual Communities, explore online identity, with emphasis on the concept of \"masking\" identity. They say that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere, they portray a mask of their identity. This is no different online and becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor makes concerning his or her online profile. He or she must answer specific questions about age, gender, address, username and so forth. With the accrual of one's online activity, his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing, vocabulary and topics."]}, {"page": "Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee", "response": ["*Richard Coyne"]}, {"page": "Technoromanticism (book)", "response": ["Technoromanticism: Digital Narrative, Holism, and the Romance of the Real is a philosophical book written by Richard Coyne, published in 1999.", "*Richard Coyne, Technoromanticism, (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1999)."]}, {"page": "Coyne (surname)", "response": ["*Richard Coyne, Professor of Architectural Computing"]}, {"page": "Coyne, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Coyne"]}]}}
