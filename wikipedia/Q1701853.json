She was normal mistress at the University College of South Wales & Monmouthshire from 1891 to 1904. This is where she met John Stuart Mackenzie, professor of philosophy at the University College, a Hegelian and author of a number of philosophical works and text books. The couple were married in 1898, and at her request the university allowed her to continue as normal mistress thereafter. When the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire opened their teacher training for female students, she was appointed to head it, the university being then just a few years old and having a welcoming and enlightened policy towards female students and staff.  She made history through her appointment to associate professor in 1904 and to professor of education (women) in 1910, making her the first female professor in Wales and the first female professor appointed to a fully chartered university in the United Kingdom.The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy Edited by A.C.

He argued for the existence of an omnipotent mind, a \"supreme self\" in the universe.Mackenzie, J. S. (1926). Personality and Reality: A Proof of the Reality of a Supreme Self in the Universe By J. E. Turner. Philosophy 1 (4): 516-517. In his book The Nature of Deity he used cosmological and teleological arguments as evidence for the Supreme Self.Burgh, W. G. de. (1927).

Philosopher John Stuart Mackenzie commented that Turner was \"one of the most notable of the few remaining writers who carry on the tradition of Hegelian idealism\" but noted it was doubtful that Turner could offer proof for the Supreme Self and that his statements were suggestive rather than conclusive."]}]}}
