His elder brother was the photographer and writer Eric de Mar\u00e9. He was educated at St Cyprian's School, Wellington College, and Peterhouse, Cambridge. He trained for a medical career at St George's Hospital and qualified as a doctor in 1941. He enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1942, and was trained for Army psychiatry by Rickman and Wilfred Bion at Northfield Hospital. It was an interesting time to work as a psychiatrist: the First World War had seen ground-breaking work in diagnosing and treating trauma, and with battle casualties arriving home, Patrick de Mar\u00e9 had plenty of patients to look after and study. He ran an Exhaustion Centre throughout the European campaign,Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster The Shadows of Total War: Europe, East Asia, and the United States Cambridge University Press 2003  at the end of which he returned to Northfield Hospital, where he joined S.
