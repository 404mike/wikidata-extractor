In this retelling of the original story, her name is Queen Ravenna. Queen Ravenna is depicted as scheming and power-hungry as well as vain. She kills the King on their wedding night, so her animosity toward Snow White is not rooted in competition for the King's favor. Rather, the Queen Ravenna fears that Snow White will challenge her rule over the kingdom. Queen Ravenna's obsession with power and beauty is explained by a reference to childhood trauma, in which her mother tells her that beauty is a weapon to be used for protection; additionally, the strength of her powers seems to correlate to her appearance, and both begin to fade as Snow White comes into her own. In fact, Queen Ravenna's mother is seen casting a spell on a young Queen Ravenna as men sworn to an unnamed king appear, presumably to raid the small settlement in which Queen Ravenna and her brother, who is also an antagonist in the film, reside. This iteration of her Magic Mirror assures her that the only way to render her powers and her youth permanent is to consume Snow White's heart. She is destroyed by the Huntsman-trained Snow White in the final duel. Director Rupert Sanders said: \"It was very important that we didn\u2019t have a terrible cut-out villain. We had someone who was doing evil things from a fear and weakness. I think it is important that you do sympathize with her to a degree, but also really understand why she is the person she\u2019s become because she wasn\u2019t born evil. It was a journey for her to become evil, and I think it was very important to myself and Charlize Theron to play a realistic version of the queen.\" Theron said about the character: \"At first, I didn't really understand why she was evil or losing her mind, but once I understood that it wasn't just the fact that her mortality relied upon finding Snow White, and that knowing that and not being able to do anything and being stuck in a castle. Well, I think that would be maddening for somebody like her. It reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson's character in The Shining - that idea that you're stuck in this place and you can't escape it, that cabin fever.\" Theron was reported as likely to return for the role of Queen Ravenna in the film's sequel, The Huntsman: Winter's War, which opens with a flashback exploring Ravenna's relationship with her younger sister, Freya, whose ice powers are awoken after her lover apparently kills their daughter. At the film's conclusion, Ravenna is revealed to have hidden part of herself in the Mirror, allowing her to be restored to life when Freya tries to claim its power, but this backfires when Ravenna reveals that she was responsible for the death of Freya's daughter out of jealousy, prompting Freya to aid the Huntsman in destroying the mirror and thus apparently killing Ravenna. Although a golden raven flying away hints that a part of the Mirror, and thus Ravenna, may have survived."]}, {"page": "Abraham Van Helsing", "response": ["* In 2012, a new movie was announced, this one with Tom Cruise to star and produce along with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, while Rupert Sanders was in talks to helm the film.

Responding to the backlash, the actress asserted she would never play a non-white character, but wanted to take the rare opportunity to star in a female-led franchise. Ghost in the Shell grossed $169.8million worldwide against a production budget of $110million. In March 2017, Johansson hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth time, making her the 17th person, and the fourth woman, to enter the NBC sketch comedy's prestigious Five-Timers Club.
