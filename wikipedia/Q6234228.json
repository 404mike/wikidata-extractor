He had formed The Hangovers with former The Raincoats member Gina Birch, and played bass and guitar on their debut album, Slow Dirty Tears released in 1998.  He had contributed bass to \"Tamagnocchi\" on Mouse on Mars' Autoditacker LP in 1997.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laika (band)", "response": ["Laika were an English band formed in 1993 and helmed by Margaret Fiedler (lead vocals, programming) and Guy Fixsen (guitar, programming). Their lineup also included John Frenett (bass), Lou Ciccotelli (drums), Louise Elliot (flute, saxophone), and Rob Ellis (drums). Laika were founded following Fiedler and Frenett's departure from the band Moonshake; Laika's other members had previously worked with different artists on the roster of Moonshake's label Too Pure. Laika's experimental style blended diverse genres, including electronica, krautrock, dub, hip hop, and jazz. They released their debut album Silver Apples of the Moon in 1994, and followed with 1997's Sounds of the Satellites, both to critical praise. Laika released two subsequent albums, 2000's Good Looking Blues and 2003's Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing, after which they entered an indefinite hiatus.", "The creative tensions in Moonshake ultimately became personal and the band broke up after a tour of the United States in 1993. While Callahan kept the Moonshake name and continued the band (along with the drummer Mig Morland and various guest musicians), Fiedler and the band's bass guitarist John Frenett both left. Fiedler began working with Guy Fixsen as her writing and recording partner, as well as beginning a romantic relationship with him. The new partnership, with Frenett playing bass guitar, continued to develop the approach Fiedler had taken with her songs in Moonshake. The band named themselves after the Russian dog Laika, the first animal to orbit the earth."]}, {"page": "Margaret Fiedler McGinnis", "response": ["After a move to London, England, McGinnis formed Moonshake in 1991 with David Callahan, formerly of The Wolfhounds.

The band produced four albums and five singles for Too Pure between 1994 and 2003, however after Fixsen and McGinnis broke up, the band took a break.

The only consistent member was singer/sampler player/occasional guitarist David Callahan, who initially co-led the project with Margaret Fiedler (Fiedler and bass player John Frenett would leave Moonshake in 1993 to form the more commercially successful Laika). The band was notable for its extensive use of textures and sampler technology in a rock context.", "David Callahan (vocals, guitars, samplers) had been in indie rock band The Wolfhounds, who were active for much of the second half of the 1980s. Often associated with the C86 indie scene of the time, the band released several acclaimed albums of abrasive guitar pop and a dozen or so singles on a variety of labels. Following the dissolution of The Wolfhounds, Callahan decided to form a new band and recruited Margaret Fiedler (vocals, guitars, samplers), John Frenett (bass) and finally Miguel \"Mig\" Moreland (drums, percussion).

I haven't spoken to Dave in years...\" Earlier (in a 1995 Laika interview), she commented \"Laika is a close working collective; in Moonshake that was never possible. David and I always did what we liked. I have never compromised myself and that's the main reason why I was forced to leave the band.
