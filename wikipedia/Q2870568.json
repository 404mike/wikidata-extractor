He went on to study for a year at Oxford University.\nAt twenty, he launched his journalism career at the Telegraph Group, and also wrote for many other publications including Private Eye, in which he presented a profile that was half Tory grandee and half cheeky rebel. As a young man, Waugh wrote five novels that were quite well received, but gave up fiction for fear of unfavourable comparisons with his father.\nHe and his wife Lady Teresa had four children and lived at their manor house in Combe Florey in Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Beano", "response": ["Notable famous members of the old Dennis the Menace/Beano Club include Auberon Waugh, Mike Read, and Mark Hamill, as well as honorary members Paul Gascoigne, and Princes William and Harry.
