It was quite possible for a horse to have a terrible dressage test, then run a clean cross-country and show jumping, and still finish near the top of the standings. Since then, correct dressage training has become increasingly important should a horse and rider wish to be placed (complete all sections and finish in the top 12). This can be traced back to Sheila Willcox, who took a particular interest in dressage, becoming abundantly clear when she won Badminton three years running in the 1950s. She had a strong influence on Mary King and Lucinda Green amongst others."]}, {"page": "Burghley Horse Trials", "response": ["|Sheila Willcox (GBR)"]}, {"page": "Mary King (equestrian)", "response": ["After school, she went to work for Sheila Willcox, a former European Champion, where she learned everything, from breaking in and producing young horses, to top class stable management."]}, {"page": "European Eventing Championships", "response": ["| 1957 ||  Copenhagen ||  Sheila Willcox on High and Mighty ||  August L\u00fctke-Westh\u00fcs on Franco ||  Jonas Lindgren on Eldorado", "| 1957 ||  Copenhagen || Sheila Willcox on High & MightyTed Marsh on Wild VentureDerek Allhusen on LaurienKit Tatham-Warter on Pampas Cat || August L\u00fctke-Westh\u00fcs on Franko IISiegfried Dehning on FechtlanzeReiner Klimke on LausbubDieter F\u00f6sken || Jonas Lindgren on EldoradoEvert Petterson on Tom RaidPetrus Kastenman on IllusterK.G.
