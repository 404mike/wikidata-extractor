It had previously been part of the seat of Murray, with a small portion in Mandurah.

At the 2005 election, it was won by former Court minister Dr Kim Hames, who had been the member for Yokine but lost to Labor's Bob Kucera in 2001. Despite being a smaller quota seat under the previous system of electoral malapportionment, the 2005 one vote one value reforms did not significantly affect the seat due to rapid population growth. In the 2021 state elections Lisa Munday defeated the sitting Liberal opposition leader, Zak Kirkup, turning it on paper into a safe Labor seat in one stroke. Munday became the first Labor member ever to win the seat.

The headquarters of Telstra Rally Australia would also be located at the Super Special Stage at Gloucester Park during the event. The idea of moving the rally to Gloucester park was introduced after concerns were raised surrounding the prediction of poor weather events at Langley Park, the venue of Super Special Stages for the past 11 years. Gloucester Park was also chosen as the venue of choice due to its strategic area and facilities. Prior to the confirmation of the venue change, there were also issues regarding how the rally may degrade the quality of the trotting track. Race organizers, engineers, and experts were involved in developing a track design that would not affect the quality of the trotting track.
