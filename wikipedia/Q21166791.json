He was responsible for the design of the Anglican St Paul's Church, Calcutta (1839\u201347) in Bengal during Company rule in India, now the cathedral of the Diocese of Calcutta and sited in Kolkata, India.Forbes's design for the spire and crossing tower of St Paul's, Calcutta was inspired by Norwich Cathedral, in Norfolk, England. After damage in successive earthquakes in 1897 and 1934 the tower and spire were redesigned on the model of the \"Bell Harry\" Tower \u2013 designed by John Wastell \u2013 on the crossing of Canterbury Cathedral in Kent, the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the mother church of the Anglican Communion.Forbes was also architect in 1831 of the Greek Revival Calcutta Silver Mint and drew inspiration for the portico from the Parthenon in Athens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata", "response": ["In 1819, at the request of Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings  then Governor-General of Bengal  Royal Engineers officer William Nairn Forbes produced a design for the proposed cathedral; however, it was not accepted as it was deemed too expensive to build. Bishop Middleton suggested as a site for the new cathedral the part of the city now known as \"Fives Court\", where the cathedral now stands. In 1762 the area had been described as a forest so wild that it harbored tigers and at first it was regarded as \"too far south\" to serve as a location for the cathedral. Middleton died in 1822 before building plans took shape. The next three bishops  Reginald Heber, Thomas James and John Turner  all died after brief tenures, and it was not until 1832, under Bishop Daniel Wilson, that the project to build the cathedral was revived.", "Following acquisition of  of land to build the cathedral, a Cathedral Committee was set up to build it. The military engineer, Major William Nairn Forbes (17961855) (who later became a Major-General in the Bengal Engineers), at the request of Bishop Wilson, designed the cathedral with the assistance of architect C.\u00a0K.\u00a0Robinson, modelling the tower and spire on Norwich Cathedral. On 8October 1839, construction was initiated by laying the cornerstone. The cathedral was completed after eight years and consecrated on 8October 1847. The consecration ceremony, to mark which Queen Victoria had sent \"ten pieces of silver-gilt plate\" for the cathedral, was largely attended by Europeans and local people. The cathedral was built in Gothic revival style, but with modern construction elements, including an iron framework. It was built with a chancel, a sanctuary, chapels and a  tall spire; the cost of construction of the edifice was then Rs.4,35,669. The cathedral can accommodate 800 to 1,000 people."]}, {"page": "William Forbes", "response": ["*William Nairn Forbes (1796\u20131855), British military engineer (St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata#History)"]}, {"page": "Bengal Engineer Group", "response": ["Besides service on the battlefield, the Bengal Engineers also rendered valuable peacetime contributions.
