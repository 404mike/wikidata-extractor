On April 27 the reactivated Bulls played their first game in the new league, defeating the Burlington Bees 5-0. Three years later, in September 1948, Tom Wright, a former Bulls outfielder, became the first Carolina League player to make it to the majors when he debuted with the Boston Red Sox. Three years after that, the Bulls helped make history when their 5-4 loss to the Danville Leafs featured the first black player in Carolina League history, Percy Miller Jr., who played for the Leafs. It would not be until April 18, 1957 that the Bulls fielded African-American players, when third baseman Bubba Morton and pitcher Ted Richardson took the field in a loss to Greensboro. That season also saw the first Carolina League All-Star game played in Durham."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Ted Richardson||||1926\u20131928||50||10||"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Ted Richardson||||MF||1||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Ted Richardson||||MF||5||0||0||0||5||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Ted Richardson||||1923\u20131924||6||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||0"]}, {"page": "Edward Richardson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Ted Richardson (1902\u2013?), footballer"]}, {"page": "Teddy Richardson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Richardson"]}]}}
