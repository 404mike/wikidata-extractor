He is regarded as the founder and early propagator of the Two by Twos movement. Rapid growth was experienced in its initial decades, and Irvine eventually came into conflict with the regional overseers whom he had appointed to administer the now worldwide religion. Irvine was excommunicated by the overseers in 1914 and eventually moved to Jerusalem, supported by loyalists who followed him out of the movement. He spent his remaining years writing apocalyptic and prophetic letters to his remaining followers around the world from Jerusalem, where he died in March 1947.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* William Irvine (1863\u20131947), evangelist and founder of the Cooneyite and Two by Two sects"]}, {"page": "Kilsyth", "response": ["Following its foundation as an early monastic settlement, the town has a long tradition of radical protestantism.

Irvine began independently preaching a return to the method of itinerant ministry he claimed was set forth in Matthew 10. Church growth was rapid, spreading outside Ireland. Irvine eventually began preaching a new order in which the hierarchy that had developed within the church would have no placement. This teaching became controversial within the church and led to his expulsion by church overseers around 1914. One of the church's most prominent evangelists, Edward Cooney, was expelled a decade after Irvine. The church then became much less visible to outsiders for the next half-century. Publication of several articles and books, increased news coverage, and the appearance of the Internet have since opened the church to wider scrutiny.", "In 1896, William Irvine was sent from Scotland to southern Ireland as a missionary by John George Govan's Faith Mission, an interdenominational organization with roots in the Holiness movement. Because his mission was successful, he was promoted to superintendent of Faith Mission in southern Ireland.", "As the ranks of its ministry increased, the church's outreach expanded. Large gatherings were held in Dublin, Glasgow and Belfast during 1899. Annual conventions, modeled after the evangelical Keswick Conventions in England, began to be held regularly in Ireland starting in 1903. Later that year, William Irvine, accompanied by Irvine Weir and George Walker, took his message to North America. Missions to continental Europe, Australia and Asia followed.", "William Irvine's progressive revelation continued to evolve over this time, and eschatological themes began to appear in sermons. By 1914, he had begun to preach that the Age of Grace, during which his \"Alpha Gospel\" had been proclaimed, was coming to a close. As his message turned towards indicating a new era, which held no place for the ministry and hierarchy that had rapidly grown up around the \"Alpha Gospel\", resentment arose on the part of overseers who saw him as a threat to their positions.", "After the death of Australian overseer William Carroll in 1953, an attempt was made to reintegrate the repudiated adherents of William Irvine and Edward Cooney. Rather than producing further unity, the attempt produced conflicts over the church's history which was exposed, the existence of legal names, disagreements over the hierarchy which had developed and other controversies. Many excommunications took place in the subsequent effort to enforce harmony.", "The earliest workers and overseers were succeeded by a new generation of leaders. In Europe, William Irvine died in 1947, Edward Cooney died in 1960, and John Long (expelled in 1907) died in 1962. British overseer Willie Gill died in 1951. In the South Pacific, New Zealand overseer Wilson McClung died in 1944, and Australian overseer John Hardie died in 1961.

An independent evangelist, Edward Cooney, came into contact with Irvine soon afterward, though he did not join the new church immediately.Daniel (1993), p. 169. In 1901,Mac Annaidh 2008, p. 49.

Instead of placing himself under a local overseer, or taking that position for himself, he continued to preach in different countries on a truly itinerant basis. He also increasingly criticized the hierarchical structure that had formed within the Two by Twos, its finances, its denial of its origins, and its having registered under a name (\"The Testimony of Jesus\") during WWI.Johnson (1995), p. 51Parker and Parker (1982), pp. 72\u201373."]}, {"page": "Edward Cooney", "response": ["He became one of the early leaders of a church founded by William Irvine after leaving his business career.

He continued his worldwide missions as an itinerant evangelist until his death in 1960.", "Edward travelled throughout Ireland on behalf of his family's business, and during the 1890s began preaching in the towns which he visited. As many of these areas were primarily Roman Catholic, Cooney's strident Protestant views often resulted in an uproar. Although still an active member of the Church of Ireland, he occasionally preached alongside members of other churches. In 1897, he met William Irvine in Borrisokane.", "William Irvine was a preacher with the interdenominational Faith Mission who had become convinced that all churches had become apostate. In 1897, Irvine had begun preaching independently, and began gathering the nucleus of what would become a notable sect, the only religious movement known to have originated in Ireland.Robinson 2005, p. 35. Cooney was profoundly influenced by Irvine's vision of a return to the method of ministry as commanded in Matthew 10, and regarded Irvine as \"a prophet raised up by God\".", "Four years later, Cooney abandoned the family business, sold all his possessions, and joined Irvine's new movement.

Long joined the Faith Mission Prayer Union in 1898 and continued his membership until 1915. Long resigned his Methodist colporteurage in November 1898, and his membership in the Methodist Church a year later.
