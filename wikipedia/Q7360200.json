Though the local scrub land was unsuitable for farming, Lloyd George established a successful fruit and pig farm at Bron-y-de and sold excess produce at his own farm shop. A water diviner travelled from Wales to the farm and found a source of irrigation underground. Lloyd George's private secretary A. J.

Nobody knows what are the true facts about the financial aspect. The agricultural aspect is totally mucked up and discontent is rife amongst all the staff. It is an unhappy place and is a cemetery to many an innocent and enthusiastic person'."]}]}}
