He just wanted to defend first and foremost, and then work on the technical side. He\u2019s one for the future\". Four days later he joined National League side Chester on loan until January 2017, alongside \"Saddlers\" teammate Liam Roberts. He made his first-team debut on 6 August, during a 3\u20130 defeat to Gateshead at the Gateshead International Stadium. On 16 August, he scored his first goal in senior football during a 3\u20132 defeat at Barrow. He missed two months of action after suffering an injury at Macclesfield Town in October. He helped the \"Blues\" to keep 10 clean sheets during his first 16 league appearances of the 2016\u201317 season and manager Jon McCarthy was keen to extend the loan deal further, which he managed to do after short time back at Walsall in January.
