The first edition was the standard reference for palm evolution and classification and the second edition, expanding on the original, is expected to achieve that same benchmark.He studied at the University of Cambridge, B.A.(1967), M.A. (1970) and Ph.D. (1970) before working at Kew Gardens.In 2004, Dransfield was awarded the Linnean Medal, an annual award given by the Linnean Society of London.\nThe genus Dransfieldia was named for him, as was the species Adonidia dransfieldii.\nHis wife is Dr Soejatmi Dransfield.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*John Dransfield"]}, {"page": "Liberty Hyde Bailey", "response": ["When Bailey began studying palms, about 700 species had been identified. The number reached thousand by 1946, the rise due in large part to his intensive study of the family. Ill health finally forced Bailey to discontinue collecting abroad in 1949, at the age of 91. He continued to study, compare, and write about his palm specimens. His ultimate goal was to produce an authoritative guide to all palms, titled Genera Palmarum. When he died, he left behind a manuscript of the first page of the introduction. Genera Palmarum was ultimately published by Drs. Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield in 1987. A second, expanded, edition was released in 2008. \u00a0"]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*2004: Geoffrey Allen Boxshall and John Dransfield"]}, {"page": "Livistona", "response": ["In 1983 a species of palm from Somalia was formally transferred to the genus by John Dransfield and Natalie Whitford Uhl.", "The genus has a disjunct distribution, which is split into three contiguous areas. The range of Livistona carinensis in Africa is very far away from that of the other species in the genus. In 1983 John Dransfield and Natalie Whitford Uhl first suggested that this odd pattern was due to a formerly much more extensive distribution during the warmer and moister climate of the Miocene, including areas between it and the rest, but that prehistoric climate change split them. Later DNA evidence of a mass of ancient extinctions between L. carinensis and the rest is thought to corroborate the theory. The recognition of Saribus has split the remaining distribution into a group of species found in Australia and southern New Guinea, and another group of species in East and Southeast Asia."]}, {"page": "Jubaea", "response": ["It has long been assumed that the extinct palm tree of Easter Island belonged to this genus as well; however, in 2008, John Dransfield controversially placed it in its own genus, Paschalococos."]}]}}
