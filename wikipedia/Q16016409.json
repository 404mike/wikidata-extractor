He appeared in one of the most memorable scenes in the sitcom in which his character displays a \"sense of humour failure\" when a joke is repeated to him. He also had small parts in films, the most memorable of which was in Batman as crime boss Vinnie Ricorso, who is fatally stabbed in the throat with a quill pen by the Joker.\nIn 1984 he appeared in the iconic music video for the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song Relax as a man dressed as a Roman emperor in a gay nightclub. He also appeared in commercials including the acclaimed 1985 advertisement for Levi Strauss & Co. jeans with Nick Kamen that was set in a Laundromat. Dair died of lung cancer in 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Relax (song)", "response": ["The first official music video for \"Relax\", directed by Bernard Rose and set in an S&M themed gay nightclub, featuring the bandmembers accosted by buff leathermen, a glamorous drag queen, and an obese admirer dressed up as a Roman emperor, played by actor John Dair, was allegedly banned by MTV and the BBC, prompting the recording of a second video, directed by Godley and Creme in early 1984, featuring the group performing with the help of laser beams. However, after the second video was made the song was banned completely by the BBC, meaning that neither video was ever broadcast on any BBC music programmes."]}, {"page": "1989 in film", "response": ["| Batman || Warner Bros.
